"""I'm 40 and I haven't done anything""","Gus Van Sant's talent and humility allows Harvey Milk to be a the center of this remarkable story without putting himself in front of the camera. Sean Penn shines with a new and extraordinary light as Harvey Milk. His humanity is overwhelming at times. That permanent smile defining his face talks volumes about his faith in people, no matter what. His awareness is filled with truth and innocence, he worries he's about to be 40 and hasn't accomplished anything. Little did he know.The film is constructed brilliantly in a series of vignettes that builds up into a whole fluid narrative. Josh Brolin, as the disturbed Dan White is another standout in a complex and remarkable performance. No cheap shots here. Diego Luna, Joseph Cross and Emile Hirsch are also terrific as the boys around Harvey but it is James Franco who truly gets under your skin. His romantic turn is one of the most compelling gay love stories I've ever seen (and I've seen Brokeback Mountain). Highly recommended!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great Actors and a Great Filmmaker at the service of a Great Story,"Enormously moving film/document about the raise and fall of Harvey Milk. If you don't know who he was, you will. The most startling feature of the film is the casting of Sean Penn. A stroke of genius. I, personally, never would have though that the range of this fantastic actor was as wide as this. He took me over and convinced me. I was watching Harvey Milk himself and Penn with the extraordinary support of his director never betrays that illusion. I'm sorry ""Milk"" didn't come out a few weeks ago. For those in California having to vote for Proposition 8, it would have been easier to decide just by watching Anita Bryant ranting about the evils of homosexuality. She sounded ridiculous then, Im sure, but today she sounds ridiculously ancestral. The vision of Harvey Milk is still, unfulfilled but we're certainly getting closer. Gus Van Sant surrounds our hero by an extraordinary group of young actors, in particular Emile Hirsch, James Franco and a superlative Josh Brolin. Not to be missed.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Everything comes together in this one,"Let's get one thing out of the way. Is it entertaining? And how! Sean Penn's best performance to date  Oscar quality; Emile Hirsch riotously perfect (best ""supporting?""); James Franco heartbreaking; Diego Luna, devastating; Josh Brolin, flawless. Not one false note in any of the actors  a very complicated story unfolds with absolute clarity. I will be seeing this one again just for the screenplay. I was very gratified that no attempt is made to be ""delicate"" about Harvey Milk's personality, either his sex life or his out-sized ego, which perhaps ironically for some, makes him all the more heroic. The finest ""political"" film I think I've ever seen. It does more than dramatize a strong true story, it captures convincingly the truth about a whole political movement. (One that's as freshly active as today's headlines: Prop 6 or Prop 8  does it ever end?) There is an ease and familiarity to the ""scene""  to the historical period and place  with very few, small anachronisms, as far as I could tell. This is also the most assured work of Gus Van Sant, a genuine film artist, who here delivers a complete drama with real visual style and brazen wit. The blending of documentary footage is the most seamless I can remember seeing anywhere. The crowd scenes are remarkable, and all of the location shooting miraculously right. For a couple of fast, fast hours, I felt as though I had spent a couple of days  hilarious, intense, inspiring days  immersed in 1970s San Francisco. This movie does what all movies should do. See it.",,Anonymous,Biography
Van Sant delivers a great marriage of art and history,"Just caught the Portland premiere and have a few thoughts.Very thankful this film was made. Until now, it seemed like I was fairly alone in knowing about Harvey's legacy. After ""Milk"" starts getting attention....I hope that a whole new generation will come to know the Mayor of Castro Street (see Randy Shilt's book) and the importance of the gay rights movement.That being said, Van Sant's ""Milk"" is great marriage of art and history. Instead of a dry portrait of an assasinated leader, we get a beautifully rendered flavor of the times, and an intimate vision of a man finding his place within a community and history.Casting is brilliant. Penn inhabits Harvey Milk in a way that few actors I believe would be capable. His physicality and energy is very believable - and it's easy to forget what actor you're watching. After a while...it's just Harvey. I could go on about the supporting cast...all very solid in their own way. James Franco (Scotty) stands out as well....showing his range and willingness to expand as an actor.Kudos all the way around...I see this film getting several nods at Oscar time.Additionally...Rob Epstein's Oscar-winning 1984 documentary ""The Times of Harvey Milk"" is a definite must for anyone who enjoyed this film. I watched it right after ""Milk"" - and am still impressed with how affecting it is.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A reasonably standard biopic about a critical figure in the gay rights movement.,"It seems like there are biopics for almost every notable person who has done anything significant in the last 50 years. In the case of Milk (2008), we get a peek into the personal, professional, and political life of gay rights activist Harvey Milk (Sean Penn). Unfortunately, as is the case with most biopics, I have found that the titular character is good at enacting societal change but at the cost of their relationship with a significant other. To me, I generally throw my hands up in the air and yell, ""Come on!"" when this happens since it seems to be ubiquitous with the genre.While I don't mind watching a film about the activism behind gay rights, I do mind having to watch Sean Penn and James Franco make out. What struck me as odd was a portion of the film where people were encouraged to come out as being homosexual, which a majority of these characters probably never had to do because they were so flamboyantly gay as to erase any suspicion. Still, it was weird to see a time when these individuals weren't accepted for who they were, even in the now-famous/infamous town of San Francisco.I can appreciate that this movie shows the long process that Milk took to gain the recognition and power to affect change. The fact that a martyr was used to push these efforts over the edge is a bit sad, though. Still, just once, I'd like to watch a biopic where the main character remains faithful to their significant other, especially with all the help they usually receive from them when they're starting out. If anything, this character flaw might humanize these people, but at the detriment of the message they're trying to get across to the audience.A reasonably standard biopic about a critical figure in the gay rights movement, I give Milk 3.0 stars out of 5.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A chronicle of history,"I had little expectations walking into this film. The trailer for this movie has appeared at almost every feature film I've seen for the last two months. But, the trailer is a facile example of this minutely detailed story of the rise of a leader and his martyrdom. While I'm familiar with the story from other sources (Shilts' ""The Mayor of Castro Street,"" and the 1984 documentary ""The Times of Harvey Milk""), Gus Van Sant and his cast bring a new immediacy to this story.None involved in this project could have anticipated the political climate of the premiere of this film: Both the hope of the Obama Presidency and the propaganda that helped Proposition 8 win in California. It seems a perfect environment for this story to reach across America.The dignity with which all of this is told and acted is its success. At the same time, it doesn't shy away from the culture of the Castro. Perhaps the greatest compliment is the rendering of Dan White here. He is neither demonized nor excused.We also don't get a white-washed version of Harvey Milk. He's there on the screen with all his foibles and kinks. Although his humanism shines in Sean Penn's unsettlingly accurate portrayal. It was Milk's love of--and impatience with--the rest of us that makes him a legend. And that is center stage in this film.What Van Sant gives us is both humbling and an inspiration.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Moral, ethical, honestly Christian","I never vibrated together with Van Sant, but this time I must say he convinced me.The main merit of ""Milk"" is that it conveys A MORAL PRINCIPLE - in an extraordinarily powerful, and stylish too, way. Or, as it's also stated: ""What matters is the fight, more than the outcome!"" The script, very dense and well organized, follows the fastidious steps of building up a message, at the same time respecting the ingrate historic chronology - the perpetual dilemma of the docudrama. All around this structure, the direction skilfully grows-up the flesh of the human content, social layers and ethical matters. It turns out a definite lesson of movie-making, for all to see and learn.I should also add that my country, Romania, is just passing through the historical stage that ""Milk"" is depicting: pushing homophobia into obsolescence and reaching normality. As such, initially our rating commission came with a positively ludicrous decision: banning ""Milk"" for the 18- audiences, because (hear this, as a pearl of idiocy!) ""It makes propaganda for a certain sexual orientation!"" I gave them a piece of my mind, in my own review, pointing out that the movie only MAKES PROPAGANDA FOR MORALS, so it should be recommended to ALL AGES AUDIENCES, no matter how young! In the end, after an official complain, they relented and lowered the rating to ""not recommended to under-15"". Still silly, but one can't have it all, can we? Thank God, audiences who don't care about this movie will ignore it, and those who do, will see it nonetheless. And become better human beings.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Amazing Story, Good Movie","First of all, I recommend that people see this movie. I am a straight, married man, and I would recommend it to anyone. I am extremely happy that this movie was made. I was a child when these events took place, and I was fairly ignorant about Harvey Milk, knowing of his activism but not much about it.Harvey Milk was simply an amazing human being, and his story is moving, dramatic, important and inspiring. Yet there was something about this movie, be it the pacing or something else, that made it less than the sum of its parts. And the parts were all great.I have to say that the performances are fantastic. Everyone will likely scream for Sean Penn to get an Oscar nomination, but I think that James Franco gave a performance that was equally fantastic. I hope that he gets the recognition that he deserves. In fact, he grounded the film and gave the story a balance, a home. And all of the supporting characters are engaging and well performed.And the sets, costumes and production design, capturing the 70's with engaging perfection, added a true sense of place to the movie.So I was left asking, as I walked onto the street, ""How do you take a great man, a great story, great performances, and great production design, and make a movie that is good? Not great. Not amazing. Good."" Tellingly, the most emotionally charged moment, the moment when the audience cheers the most, proves that movie did not live up to its subject.See it. Even if, like me, you wish the movie itself was better, you will be glad that you saw this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Moving and inspiring,"I saw this last night at the Portland premiere with Gus Van Sant and James Franco among others. This is a powerful work and, in my opinion, Gus Van Sant has taken a big step towards the mainstream in his artistic direction. To me, the person who is by no means a movie expert, it seems that this movie had a much faster, accessible pace than his other movies. There were no long-shots or minutes at a time without dialog, etc.I've really never thought much of Sean Penn before, but, with this role, I expect him to sweep up the awards. Everyone was great in their parts, but he did such an excellent job in portraying the Harvey Milk that I have seen before in clips and documentaries. They did not make out Milk to be a choir-boy, which was one thing I was afraid was going to happen. This story seems long overdue in it's telling, but so completely relevant to today's news.I expect, as the movie hits theaters, this will cause quite a stir, with both sides using it as fodder in their fight. I expect the ratings will reflect this as there are already people giving it 0's who obviously did not attend the premiere. I don't think it deserves a 10 either, but is much, much closer to that end. Looked at objectively, it is a sometimes tearful, sometimes funny movie that was put together masterfully",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Shame it descends into Oscar fodder,"Milk should have been a classic, it has all the elements of a great film from the outstanding performances to the story itself which is a stranger than fiction tale (especially for those of us who are too young to remember such homophobic laws being considered in a developed country)Unfortunately what let this film down was, at times, rather shockingly obvious direction. I normally like Gus Van Sant films but this time it appears he was more focused on restating the obvious and over playing scenes which would have been very emotional otherwise... The last 10-15 minutes of this movie are an awful example of someone who should have had more courage in the editing room (especially with such strong performances from the actors)With 30 minute reduction in run time and a stronger belief in the intelligence of the audience this would have been superb",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"'All Men Are Created Equal. No Matter How Hard You Try, You Can Never Erase Those Words'.","The last Gus Van Sant movie I saw was 'Elephant', a film that did not work for me. Thankfully he is back with 'Milk' which pretty much gives a detailed account of the rise of Harvey Milk and his martyrdom. Van Sant uses live footage between scenes which reminds one of how much harsher the world once was to people who were 'different'. The writing is stupendous and the dialogues are especially effective. The portrayal of the characters are very human. There is no hero or villain. There are just humans with flaws, humans fighting for what they believe in. Van Sant sets a tense and chaotic tone right from the beginning. The 70s atmosphere is well created through makeup and costumes. The use of brownish tinted light may arise nostalgia. It is two remarkable performances that make 'Milk' stand out: Sean Penn's very accurate and nuanced portrayal of Harvey Milk and Josh Brolin's layered portrayal of a complex Dan White. I doubt 'Milk' would have been effective enough if it weren't for such strong acting. The director deserves mention for his brilliant work. Movies like 'Milk' are relevant today because they serve as a reminder of how difficult life once was and how people fought against it and lives were sacrificed in order to create a better society for those living in today's world.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Great man, Great film, Great performance by Sean Penn","""Milk"" is the best film of 2008, hands down. Anyone unfamiliar with the story of Harvey Milk and his murder needs to know it. Those of us who have already read a ton of books and articles about Harvey Milk, and seen the award-winning documentary ""The Times of Harvey Milk"" will find a side of Harvey we had not seen before in this movie so the film really is a must-see whoever you are.The performances by the entire cast are perfection... a notch better than even the best of films. I believe this is due to the story of Harvey Milk, who inspired so many of us and changed the lives of millions of us for the better. Harvey himself surely inspired these great performances. Once you have seen Harvey's smile, and heard Harvey's words, and seen Harvey in action (as we all can do by watching ""The Times of Harvey Milk"" documentary) you can never see the world the same way again.Sean Penn's performance as Harvey could not be bettered by any actor living today, so we owe him a great debt for making this movie, and giving his heart and soul to the role. I believe it is Penn's most mature yet also most lovable role ever. I wanted the movie to go on and on, because I felt like I was actually there in San Francisco in 1978-79. Gus Van Sant recreated that world perfectly, and Sean Penn showed us the potential of this very real man with this unique ability to inspire and transform us. Gus and Sean have each earned a very special chamber in Heaven for giving us this beautiful tribute.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Gus Van Sant pays his dues,"'Milk' is another powerful mainstream American movie about gay experience. It seems destined to have the same kind of influence on the public mind as Jonathan Demme's 'Philadelphia' and Ang Lee's 'Brokeback Mountain,' both of which were prominent at Oscar time. Like them this isn't a great film but it's an important one.In 'Milk' the topic widens to gay politics and gay rights. ""These are not 'issues,'"" Harvey Milk tells a major opponent, ""these are our lives we're fighting for. "" His own life peaked at a transformative place and time for homosexuals, San Francisco in the 1970's. A San Francisco Supervisor assassinated by the disgruntled conservative Supervisor Dan White in 1978, Milk was the first openly gay man to elected to public office in California. He was a gay activist who gained fame and political clout. ""A homosexual with power--that's scary,"" Milk tells Mayor Moscone--an ally with whom he sparred, and who was assassinated with him.If he hadn't been killed early in his political career Milk might have traded his jocular title of ""Mayor of Castro Street"" (the city's predominantly gay district) for the formal one of Mayor of San Francisco. Dan White himself predicted this.While Milk sought the whole city's attention with a seemingly trivial cause--a ""pooper scooper"" law forcing citizens to clean up after their dogs, he has come to represent a profile in courage--a man willing to face up to Orange County bigots on their own turf, who insisted all gays must come out of the closet to unite in strength. The film doesn't idealize the man; his private life is obviously messy, and despite his preaching, he was in the closet to his own parents. His lover leaves him, and a new Latino boyfriend (Diego Luna) is totally unstable.Every gay advance seems to bring on a backlash. After the 1969 Stonewall Riots (alluded to in news footage as Milk opens) more gay men and lesbians were out and proud, but Anita Bryant, the Florida orange juice advertiser and right-wing Christian gay basher, was on the rampage campaigning for measures all over the country to remove gay rights. In California in 1978 one of her many causes was the Briggs Initiative, Proposition 6, which would have mandated firing all the state's gay teachers.Today, while the election of an African-American as President makes the US look more friendly toward minorities, anti-gay measures are still on ballots in many states at election times. On the same day that Obama was elected, Californian gay people saw the passage of Proposition 8, put over by Mormon money, to outlaw gay marriage in the state.Leaving behind the hermetic, personal wavelength of his best film 'My Own Private Idaho' and the stylized elegance of his recent quartet of films, Van Sant returns to a conventional mode closer to his 'Good Will Hunting' and 'Finding Forrester'--but this time with more scope and more commitment to taking a stand as a gay man with a wide audience. The writer for the film was the former Mormon Justin Lance Black, writer for several gay-related films and the TV series about a polygamist Mormon, ""Big Love."" Harvey Milk (a nicely modulated Sean Penn) first appears recording a tape testament in his final year of life, a scene that bookends the film. Penn's noted for emotionally overwrought roles but his Harvey Milk is someone who rarely loses his cool or his sense of humor even when he meets the hostile Briggs or regularly has to deal with his clueless, inept opponent Dan White (a fine Josh Brolin). Milk mocked the right-wingers' fiction that homosexuals are pedophiles who want to proselytize youth--that gays are made not born--by opening public addresses with, ""My name is Harvey Milk and I want to recruit you."" It's a line often repeated in the film.The movie, as is the way with conventional biopics, paints its subject's life in broad strokes. He meets his young lover Scott Smith (an appealing James Franco) while a corporate drone in New York. They decide to start a new life in San Francisco, and open a camera shop together on Castro Street. Before long Milk is in the thick of political activity, talking to Teamsters and cutting off his beard and pony tail and donning suit and tie to meet the general public.Milk emerges as a true politician. Moscone compares him to Boss Tweed. Through leading a successful boycott of Coors beer for the Teamsters, he forges strong links with labor. Scenes are crowded with political coworkers, and resident cute boys.Most of all the movie is a picture of community organizing and campaign management. This is told in broad stroke too, but there are many historically specific personalities. Milk ran for office many times before redistricting made a clear win possible. Scotty is his manager, till he can't bear another losing campaign and moves out. Next Milk ""recruits"" a cocky young runaway and street hustler, Cleve Jones (Emile Hirsch), who claims he can get a thousand gay men on the street on demand and also boasts ""I don't do losing."" With his new well-connected lesbian campaign manager Anne Kronenberg (Alison Pill) he secures endorsements from the Bay Guardian and the Chronicle, and he wins handily.It's unusual for a mainstream film to get so much into the practical details of local politics. At the same time Jack is jealous of Scott and Cleve and moving toward a meltdown, and Dan White, having his own more dangerous meltdown, is waiting in the wings.As a San Franciscan I wish the atmosphere of the tragic finale had been properly amplified by a horrified awareness of the Jim Jones massacre, the news of which had emerged barely a week before White shot Moscone and Milk. But otherwise this stands as an essential piece of gay and California history and Van Sant's fluent, lively film couldn't come at a better time.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Life Begins At 40,"I remember back in 1978 when I heard about the assassinations in San Francisco. The screaming headlines read Mayor Moscone Murdered on the tabloid News and Post in New York. You read the article and it said that a San Francisco City Supervisor named Harvey Milk was also killed by another supervisor Dan White.What I didn't know was how much Harvey Milk reflected my own life. A former Goldwater Republican and closeted gay man, he moved to San Francisco and affected a revolution. That was me and three years later I came out and started doing my own thing for the same righteous cause, Milk gave his life for.Milk was not the first openly gay person elected to public office. Elaine Noble and Allan Spears were serving in state legislatures when Milk finally was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Milk was not a single elected official in a large body of legislators. He became the focus of stopping a rollback of our rights that the newly empowered religious right was seeking to do and God help us, still seeks to do.San Francisco no longer is THE gay city as it was in Harvey Milk's last eight years of his life. So many places now have GLBT rights laws, so many have created their own gay culture and network. Still all of us owe so much to Harvey Milk and his circle who would not back down.A few days ago I saw Sean Penn in Bad Boys and to see him 25 years later as Harvey Milk, it's hard to believe the breadth of work that he's done as a player. There's a nomination in this for Best Actor and maybe a second one to go with the one Penn won for Dead Man Walking. You are so taken with his performance that you forget and think you're watching a hidden newsreel of the life of Harvey Milk.Josh Brolin might very well bring home an Oscar for the uptight Dan White, the assassin. What's extraordinary about Brolin's performance is that White is such an ordinary man, trapped with a set of values that taught him to despise anything different than him. There's some suggestion that White was a latent case and that might have been the ultimate reason for his terrible acts. I've seen that happen often enough in my life.In my working days before retirement in 2002 I was the only openly gay person at the New York State Crime Victims Board working there and still am, sad to say. Harvey Milk was brought to political activism by someone he knew being targeted for hate crime homicide which was never solved. In the more enlightened times of the Eighties and Nineties these things still go too often unpunished. Like Harvey these incidents were my reason for involvement.Watching Milk and inner circle many of whom went on to do great things in the Gay Rights movement, I envied them. I certainly put my years in, still do. But I would have given anything to have been involved from the beginning. They have tragic memories, but also wonderful stories to tell about a cause bigger than themselves.And for that reason this review of this wonderful film is dedicated to a gay rights pioneer whom I knew and who recently passed away. Eleanor Cooper did her activism as an emigrant from Tennessee. She dedicated her life to making the world better for her GLBT brothers and sisters for more than 30 years in New York City. She was a prime leader in the passage of New York City's gay rights law. She was unflagging optimist and never lost faith that with education and reason people would get it about us. Her optimism was infectious, buoyed many a spirit in bad times, political and personal.Harvey Milk said that he had not really done anything he was truly proud of at the age of 40 just before moving from New York to San Francisco. If he did nothing else he gave hope and encouragement to untold numbers of young gay people that you're not worthless, that you had a mission on this earth to make the best life you can for yourself and for your brothers and sisters. The best scene in the film is Milk talking to a young kid from Minnesota who was contemplating suicide and who might very well have done it as too many have.The young man's name was Paul. And this review and this film is and should also be dedicated to all the Pauls and Paulas out there who are not going to accept a second class life from ignorant people. Not any place on this globe.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Its not about winning, its about making a statement.""","Well I'm not sure if this movie will win anything but it certainly made a statement. Milk is about the first openly gay person, Harvey Milk, to be elected to office in America. Milk does a great job in putting face to the gay rights movement which is sorely needed.The acting was superb by the cast all around starting at the top with Sean Penn. As the film wore on Sean Penn became Harvey Milk. It was not just a portrayal he gave, it was a complete absorption of the man himself. Penn gave a very smart, witty and inspiring performance which carried the film throughout. Josh Brolin gave a very convincing supporting performance as Dan White who is one of Harvey Milk's colleagues. The depth that Brolin gave to his portrayal raised some questions about who Dan White really is. If in fact he is a good man or a bad man, if he is corrupt or honorable or even if he is straight or homosexual. Brolin once again proves to be one of the most overlooked actors in these past few years. Emile Hirsch always lights up the screen and continues to do so in here. James Franco though was quite a surprise to watch. I usually can't stand to watch Franco in any type of role but he proved that he can take on serious roles. This movie might be the statement Franco needed to make.The writing and directing was very solid overall allowing a greatly assembled cast to shine in so many aspects and ways. What was done in such a great way was the editing. Specifically the editing of archival footage into the movie. Most of the time I find it a bit distracting or annoying when archival footage is used but in here it was a strength. It was perfectly implemented into the movie giving the feeling that you could take the movie more seriously as a telling of a true story rather than just a movie.Milk was certainly one of the best of 2008 but we will have to see if it can stand the test of time. It made a pretty nice statement but can it win enough hearts and minds to support the gay rights movement like Harvey Milk would have wanted?",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Phenomenal, a must see for all!!!","I watched this film last night and it had me in tears. If you don't know the story of Harvey Milk, then you really should. I had never heard of him until this film and I don't know why I hadn't. I'm not gay and feel quite uncomfortable watching other guys kissing, but have nothing against homosexuality. I didn't feel uncomfortable at all throughout this film and it really left me feeling very sympathetic for the gay community, and anyone who is persecuted for being different. Sean Penn delivers the most outstanding performance i have seen him deliver in ages, it should definitely warrant an Oscar! James Franco, Josh Brolin, Emile Hirch and Diego Luna also showing their brilliance. All the actors were incredible and to think that none of them (that i know of) are actually gay. It must take some serious ability to pull that one off so believably. Maybe I just don't have a gaydar and can't see it, so could someone who is gay let me know what he thought of their performance. Anyway, there is a lot to learn from this film, it shocks me to think this happened only a generation ago and we were all such an unaccepting bunch of idiots back then. However, it tells the entire story from an unbiased view. All the homophobes and 'bad guys' aren't just displayed as bad people, but always come across as being human, albeit ignorant, you can't blame someone for their ignorance. Gus Van Sant's direction as usual was fantastic, some very innovative and clever shots, and by using an old school camera through many parts of the film, could blend real historical footage and modern film seamlessly. One of the best films I have seen all year! I hope it does well and wins multiple awards, it definitely deserves it! Enjoy this film, it has really touched me.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Yet another bland biopic,"Milk isn't a terrible movie--it's not even a bad movie--but it's nowhere near the level of gay masterpiece I hoped it would be. It's a conventional, unambiguous rallying cry with no real impact.Gus Van Sant has done some very original, highly stylized, downright weird films in the past decade. My Own Private Idaho was Shakespeare's world populated by gay prostitutes, with still life sex scenes and split screens and over-the-top dialogue; Psycho was a more surreal (and more scandalous) shot-for-shot replay of the Hitchcock original; Elephant was a hyper-realistic photograph of teenage violence starring no-name high school actors; and so on. His most conventional film was Good Will Hunting, but that at least was moving and had momentum, as well as a terrific soundtrack. Milk is just plain standard. Each character--though based on real people--can be summed up in a simple sentence, such as Emile Hirsch's Cleve Jones, the tenacious queer who... well, I don't even need a full sentence. That's about it.Sean Penn is convincing and sweet as the 40-year-old New York insurance man who realizes how boring his life is and decides to head west and make an impact. He seems to settle on a life of gay political activism simply because it's the most convenient; the attention, the theatrics, and the social bonding seem almost as important--if not more so--than the actual revolution.Which is an interesting idea, but not one that the movie really allows you to dwell on. Milk, with its fast-paced biopic structure (here's one important event... then here's another one a year later... then a close friend dies... and then there's a small triumph... and then...) and its attention to political activism, wants to be a cry for equality, not a complex, ambiguous character study. Harvey is reduced to the role of hero, champion, martyr. You're not allowed to be skeptical of his background, his relationships, his motivation, his manipulative methods. You know he's the good guy because he's on the side of equality--the ends justify the means and all that--and so you have to root for him, and that's that.But I don't enjoy that. I like rooting for villains. I like feeling sorry for the assholes. I like believing, even for just one turbulent moment, that what the psycho killer is saying makes perfect sense. And I can't stand a flawless hero. I can't stand being forced to side with someone.And as for Harvey Milk as portrayed in this film--well, he just wasn't that inspirational. Look, I'm queer and I'm liberal and all of that. It's a subject that's very close to me. Plus, I'm a sucker for inspiration, and I cry several times a year in movie theaters. But his speeches and his rallies never made me feel anything other than mildly interested on an intellectual level. The bad direction is part of that--the cinematography choices were dreadful, with very little camera-work standing out as exceptional. With each march and protest, a still camera looks head-on at the faces of the few stars as they march forward. Why? If we're supposed to be immersed in the riot, to feel like we're a part of it, why would be facing the rioters? Why would we be so still? Why not throw the camera into the action, shakily following behind the other marchers? But there's none of that.Maybe Van Sant was trying to prove that gay people are just as normal and boring as straight people, that their inspirational biopics can be just as color-by-numbers and boring as straight biopics. But who wants to see that? Harvey was loud--""My name is Harvey Milk, and I'm here to recruit you!""--Harvey was theatrical. The gay movement at that time loved to shout out loud. So why such a stifling story?There's only one aspect of the film that's interesting, and that's the relationship between Harvey Milk and Dan White (Josh Brolin, in a fine performance), the straight-laced police officer and political rival. Their awkward dance is compelling--Dan ""the man"" tries to please and work with, however distantly, his minority colleague, while Harvey desires only to destroy the competitor who represents everything he detests and opposes. Dan keeps promises that Harvey breaks. Dan drunkenly stumbles in the shadows of his fading conservative beliefs--beliefs he doesn't even necessarily understand or trust anymore--while Harvey milks up the limelight. It's a sad and scary battle of wits, and one that paints a dark, political tinge on the otherwise spotless Harvey, but the theme is confined to a few short scenes and left largely unexplored.As a movie focusing strictly on Dan vs. Harvey, this could have been a good film, but by expanding this into an eight-year-long historical examination of how great San Francisco is and how wonderful and downtrodden gay people always are, the movie strays into the realm of simple, sweeping statements. I'm disappointed by how much critical acclaim this film is getting; aside from Penn and Brolin it's rather lackluster.Milk d: Gus Van Sant w: Dustin Lance Black (Sean Penn, Josh Brolin) 6/10",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""I am not a candidate, I am part of a movement. The movement is the candidate.""","""Milk"" sees Gus Van Sant return to the mainstream after nearly a decade  of divisive 'arthouse' films, a spell he might have felt was necessary  after directing ""Psycho"" and ""Finding Forrester"" back to back. The  stunning, beautiful ""Gerry"" is still his greatest film in my  estimation, but Van Sant's return to near-unanimous mainstream acclaim  and some level of box-office success in ""Milk"" actually isn't too far  off as far as Van Sant's filmography goes. Some may express  disappointment that ""Milk"" is a 'conventional' biopic, but it really  isn't conventional at all.  True, this could have been the sort of melancholy meditation Van Sant  has been going for in recent years, but the best argument against that  is that Harvey Milk is not that figure. He's not going to sit quietly  and contemplate life. Perhaps he might have before we meet him on the  eve of his fortieth birthday, but from that point onwards Harvey Milk  was a man of action, of words, a man with the powerful ability to rally  people for a cause, and not only gay people. He had a rare sort of  energy, and an energetic film was needed to tell his story. Most  impressive perhaps about Van Sant's direction and Dustin Lance Black's  screenplay is that there are just as many of those melancholic,  meditative moments as needed, just enough to make this a compelling  character study and not a truly conventional biopic with a hero rather  than a main character. The photography here is also simply gorgeous,  and the camera work is outstanding, particularly the hand-held work  during the rally scenes. It really succeeds in transporting you to  1970's San Francisco.  Sean Penn has frequently annoyed me. I respect his abilities, but  reserve the right to express my subjective annoyance at what I perceive  as sometimes hilarious over-acting. When I found out that he was going  to play Harvey Milk I was nervous, since I have admired Harvey Milk  ever since I was first exposed to him through the Rob Epstein  documentary ""The Times of Harvey Milk"", which is still the best movie  made about Harvey Milk, with ""Milk"" running a close second, and I doubt  Bryan Singer's ""Mayor of Castro Street"" will be a serious contender. I  had no reason to be nervous. Penn's performance is one of the most  vibrant, fascinating, brilliant performances in years, and one of the  most convincing and human. It's not a Harvey Milk impression, it's more  than just that, but he truly does capture the 'essence' of Milk, if you  will.  It is pointless to make a political statement in the body of this  review, so take this as one only if you have to: it is disgusting that  in 2008 gay rights still a matter of political debate. This film is a  powerful, beautiful tribute to the rights movement. It's not a  Democrats vs. Republicans film. In fact, it makes it clear that Harvey  Milk was once a Republican, and sneaks in footage of Reagan in strong  opposition of Proposition 6. Those short scenes should provoke some  thought and discussion. They certainly did for me and the people I saw  the film with. Ultimately however the film is not about an 'issue'.  Harvey Milk says to Dan White that it's not about jobs or rights, that  it's their lives that they were and still are fighting for. Ultimately  this film is about people, not about issues, not about policy. It's  about people who were told they were sick, who were told they were  wrong, who were told they would corrupt society, who were accused of  being pedophiles and attempting to 'recruit' children to homosexuality.  The film is about Harvey Milk, a mere human being who did more for  freedom and tolerance than he probably ever understood.  ""I am not a candidate, I am part of a movement. The movement is the  candidate.""   Unfortunately, the fight against the rampant discrimination against and  hatred of homosexuals is still not over. Milk's movement lives on, and  grows stronger every day. He would be proud of that, and devastated  that our society has not truly progressed, but only learned to mask its  intolerance and hatred.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Not to be missed, whatever your persuasion","I very nearly gave this movie a miss. I'm pleased I didn't.As with the gay-themed Brokeback Mountain, many might have stayed away till they realised it was more of a movie than that. Milk is a biopic of the murdered gay rights activist, Harvey Milk. But it connects to the audience by being symbolically about everyone, every minority, anybody who has ever been bullied or ashamed to admit their beliefs. It's about the human spirit. The rights of man enshrined in the American Constitution. And it's about the compassion that lets us see our enemies as human beings.Part of this is down to an outstanding script. But much is down to Sean Penn (at times almost unrecognisable in a beard), who handles the role with a winning combination of grit and sensitivity. He becomes the master orator standing for political office. There are characters in his life that have committed suicide because of the shame of being gay. He is the first openly gay man to hold public office and he gives people hope (in much the same way, it may be said, that the similarly charismatic Barak Obama is doing for black people). We see poignant comparisons with Nazi pogroms against anyone who was 'different'. We see the fervent religious right, claiming God on their side, as they preach a message of hate.Righteous hatred is not dead in America. A few hours before seeing Milk, I had watched a horrific documentary about a family of preachers who picket not only 'faggots' but anyone they believe tacitly supports homosexuality (the footage included picketing a dead serviceman's funeral). We have laws against inciting racial hatred. How can they get away with inciting such homophobia? Milk goes back to the 70's. Politicians opposing him label homosexuals with prostitutes and thieves. Deny them any rights. An argument worth pursuing philosophically perhaps, especially as Gordon Brown's UK government is currently trying to demonise prostitution. A thief breaks the laws of property. But homosexuals  and prostitutes for that matter  offend only those whose totalitarian view of the world wish to discriminate against those who, privately and without hurting others, have the audacity to live differently. Common tactics include linking crime by association. And with prostitution there is some evidence of links to crime, although it may be linked more to marginalisation  and prostitutes could always, at least theoretically, become non-prostitutes. Homosexuality, like being black or Jewish, cannot be 'treated.' Gays can rarely, if ever, 'become straight.' And neither is sexual preference an indicator of criminal tendency.Milk takes his arguments to the most hostile of audiences. He debates with remarkable skill. But, although people warm to him for his courage and kindness, his personal life frequently sinks into tatters. Being second fiddle to a political crusader is no joyride. Even if you were straight. Campaign-trail Harvey might be fighting for your life in broad terms, but it won't help you through that long night of dinners for one.Milk admirably avoids the mistake of glossing over common faults of the gay community  notably male aversion (at the time) to lesbians. In a hilarious scene where Harvey hires a lesbian campaign manager, the all-male entourage dissolves into ridiculous girly twittering against her  until, with a few well-chosen words, she proves she's got, 'bigger balls than anyone in the room'. Harvey slowly expands his cause. He realises it can't be just about gay rights. It has to be about everyone's rights. If elected, he has to show genuine concern for everyone's troubles  not just gays. And, after a few political near-slips where he is tempted to cut a deal, he welds himself to a virtuousness in public office that his opponents can only hypocritically claim but not deliver.We know in the first few moments that he is going to die. The rest of the film is told in flashback. Penn, an actor that is occasionally too intense for my liking, has found a film where he can throw every muscle twitch, every watery eye, every shade of emotion, into a character and cause where intensity is called for. In one of the finest performances of his career, he is understated to convey finer feeling, yet passionate on the soap box to an inspirational degree.I was also very pleased to see this praiseworthy development from director Gus Van Sant. Many 'indie' directors start off with great 'artistic' work, only to be eaten up by Hollywood glitz. Van Sant's career is almost the opposite. Having proved his metal with crowd-pleasers like To Die For and Good Will Hunting, he seems gradually to have abandoned all pretensions to mainstream. His Paranoid Park was a masterstroke of subtle evocation in the thriller genre. With Milk, he has applied his skills like a great craftsman, reclaiming self-respect for the serious yet accessible artist.The one nagging criticism of course is, where are all the gay actors? I cannot fault Sean Penn's acting. He is undoubtedly the best actor for the part. But the very message of equality proclaimed so loudly by Hollywood's darling liberal left is still unheeded within their own industry. How many openly gay actors can you name? I thought so . . . And how far have we really got, really, or has apathy set in? As California bans gay marriage, one commentator noted, ""Where were today's Harvey Milks when Proposition 8 was on the ballot?""",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Eye opening and heart breaking regardless of age or sexual preference,"Born and raised in a southern, catholic community, I saw that homosexuals were always grouped with prostitutes and rapists in our religion books. Something didn't quite sit right with me when I saw this ever since I was very young. The anti gay feelings abound in a small southern city, and, although I myself am straight, I was always in the minority of gay right supporters.Van Sant's Milk could not have come at a better time in my life. This movie is a transcendent bio pic, and an inspiration to me now and forever. In my theater, a packed crowd with an average age of about 60 gathered. (I found this interesting, why so many seniors? Was it guilt?) The film exceeds both as a touching biography and a bold social statement. Van Sant really does what Alfred Hitchcock so famously did, and ""played the audience like a piano"". We laughed, we thought, and came out of the theater a little bit more in tune with reality. I was the youngest in the theater by about 40 years, so I saw from an outside looking in at what this film really did.So much has been said about how well made the film is that anything else would be redundant, but the praise is well deserved. Penn should be a top runner for Best Actor, as he completely disappears into his character. Another actor that was an absolute thrill to watch in this movie was Emile Hirsch, who was fantastic.So emotionally wrenching, it will stand the test of time. It is so powerful because everyone knows someone that's gay and someone that's a bigot. The best movie of the year I've seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
First rate story of a very important man,"My wife and I saw Milk yesterday at the Castro Theater in SF -- right around the corner from Harvey's camera shop, where I met Harvey in 1973-4. For those of us who learned from Harvey about what it meant to be gay in America at that time, and who learned genuine acceptance and love, this movie is wonderfully evocative.Harvey Milk was truly extraordinary, as were the times. This film portrays it all, for the most part accurately. Even the dog poop scene (no real spoiler here), which I had forgotten but remembered as soon as the scene began, was dead on. Van Sant is also very faithful to location, which for me, someone who lived in the neighborhood for 30 years, was really wonderful. Events were recreated where they actually happened. Sean Penn wears the same outfits Harvey wore for the Gay Rights Parade and other moments. It's great to see Cleve Jones, still a gay-rights leader, in a ""starring"" role.Why no 10 out of 10? Well, I thought Sean Penn was great, spot on, but it wasn't the earth-shattering performance I expected. Penn absorbed and became Milk, which is what he does so well. No disappointment here, since the role is not earth-shattering. Harvey grew on you; he wasn't Dr. King or Bobby Kennedy.Second and more significant, the parts that weren't so accurate. Most important here, another extraordinary man, George Moscone, relegated to being a reflection of Harvey, told what to do and how to act. Mayor Moscone was not the leader of a revolution like Harvey, but he was an extraordinarily skilled and enlightened man, a full ally of Harvey's, not the implicitly reluctant guy who needed Harvey's push. Nor was Dan White's resignation aftermath completely accurate -- 'nuff said. Moscone too was a hero, and even though the movie was about Harvey, Van Sant would have done better by giving full (albeit brief) honor to George Moscone too.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not very well made,"Harvey Milk is definitely an important activist but the filming and acting was not actually great in this movie.

OK, now that THAT'S out of the way, let me just say I have not seen a better movie than this in some time. It's a powerful portrait of our history. The story of Harvey Milk is amazing and told with great skill and sensitivity in this film. The performances are superb. Most notably, Sean Penn disappears into the role of Harvey Milk. He made me forget I was watching Sean Penn play a character. The supporting performances are also incredible. Hirsch, Franklin, Brolin and Luna add wonderful support to the stellar cast. But it is Gus Van Sant who ties together the talent and excellent writing into this gem of a movie. See it at least once.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sean Penn Should Win An Oscar,"Sean Penn totally makes up for his bland portrayal of Willie Stark in All The Kings Men with this, his career high, his portrayal of Harvey Milk, the first openly gay politician. Furthermore, he really makes up for his part in I Am Sam; we can now forgive him for that one. If Sean Penn as Milk isn't Oscar material I haven't seen Oscar material. Gay or straight, doesn't matter, you aren't going to see a performance like Penn's very often. It is classic, daring, brave and convincing. This entire epic is shear perfection, movie making like it ought to be, historic. This is what we call a classic, a slice of Americana, thee great American movie. This is an extremely important movie as well. The issues of prejudice that it deals with could not be timelier than now, in an age when America has voted into office the first black President. Once in a while Sean Penn pops up and proves to us that he is a great actor, and here he goes, doing it again.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Milk of human kindness,"In 1978, San Francisco supervisor Harvey Milk - the first openly gay man to hold public office in the United States - and the city's mayor George Moscone were assassinated by a fellow supervisor Dan White. This film - directed by Gus Van Sant (""Good Will Hunting"") - tells the story from Milk's 40th birthday in 1970 when he was fearful that his life had accomplished too little. It is a terrific performance by Sean Penn in the eponymous role with the actor capturing the speech and body mannerisms of a gay man in an understated way that avoids caricature or stereotyping. James Brolin is also accomplished as the putative killer, unable to come to terms with a changing world.In a bio-pic of this kind where the ending is already known and so clearly signaled, the power of the film comes in its style. A mixture of actual television footage from the time and a grainy and jerky style of cinematography, the real and the reel merge almost seamlessly to present a work with a distinct documentary feel, obviously intentional and perhaps enhanced by the screenplay coming from documentarist (and former Mormon) Dustin Lance Black.If the movie rather glorifies Milk and presents an uncritical portrait of a necessarily controversial character, this is a work which is about more than one man's struggle to achieve electoral power. It is an insight into gay politics that demonstrates the prejudice that had to be overcome, the hard and repeated campaigns that had to be fought, and the compromises and deals that had to be made. In that sense, it shines a torch on politics of any kind.",,Anonymous,Biography
It's a Golden Moment for all Involved,"Seldom Hollywood gets it this right, from the assured direction of Van Sant to the excellent work done by the perfectly cast actors. Overall there is a sense of reality that heightens the pain and seriousness of the situation, a painful reminder of human perspectives and how easily we tend to overlook what is best for us and take sides in order to please segments of the population.It's the story of a man who believed in making a difference and thought he would never be able to leave a mark. Throughout the film, Penn makes sure that the vulnerability, insecurity, and steely determination are flawlessly portrayed. He never creates a hero or a superman, he recreates the multifaceted individual who happened to become a crucial part of a movement that needed to be heard and ensured the rights of many people wouldn't be trampled.Many might become upset by the main subject matter, but it is important to show the various sides of the protagonist and one could hope they could go more in depth into who Dan White was, and most importantly what made him tick and eventually explode.The film is rich and filmed with a sense of realism that evokes the cinema of the 70's. It feels importantly because it deals with serious subject matter, treats it with respect, and seems to have a feeling of objectivity, giving it a very real and grave tone.It is perfectly anchored by some of the best work ever done by Penn, Hirsch, Franco, Luna, and Brolin, actors who have been doing outstanding work in the last few years, but somehow manage to reach even more impressive levels here. It's golden all around.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Milk is an absolute masterpiece and a must-see,"I recently rewatched Milk (2008) on MAX. The storyline follows Harvey Milk, who, fed up with injustices against gay men in San Francisco, transitions from activist to a run for elected office. As he faces new challenges, his pursuit of goals may expose the gaps in his life.Directed by Gus Van Sant Jr (Elephant), the film stars Sean Penn (Mystic River), Josh Brolin (No Country for Old Men), James Franco (Spider-Man), Emile Hirsch (Into the Wild) and Diego Luna (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story).Milk is a magnificent character journey, brilliantly portraying inner demons, societal pressures, political pettiness, the triumphs of dedication, and the tragedy of triumph. Penn's performance is absolutely amazing, and the supporting cast delivers authentic performances. The film effectively captures the era and the atmosphere in each scene. The shocking ending and rewarding credit sequence add to its impact.In conclusion, Milk is an absolute masterpiece and a must-see. I would give it a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of Penn's greatest performances of his career,"Sean Penn has a long list of character portrayals, many of which were critically acclaimed. One that earned him the honor of ""best actor"" at the Academy Awards was his role as the assassinated politician and LGBT advocate Harvey Milk in Gus Van Sant's 2008 biopic 'Milk.'Everything about the film revolves around Penn and how he brings to life the San Francisco city official's grassroots rise and tragic fall. Say what you will about Penn, but he's able to really dig down deep into his roles and almost actually become them in a way that makes him come across as authentic. In 'Milk,' Penn is supported by the likes of Emile Hirsch, James Franco and Diego Luna - all of whom are high-caliber actors in their own right - and he has the perfect foil in Josh Brolin as Milk's political archrival, Dan White.The film does a good job of not stretching to fit too many aspects of Milk's life into its 128 minutes, instead opting to focus on the events that took place later in his life that would shape the LGBT movement for years to come. And while it's based on true events, 'Milk' doesn't come off as being too sensational or preachy.It may not be one of the most memorable film adaptations of a U.S. politician's life, but 'Milk' continues to be one of the high water marks of Sean Penn's career.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
ALL men ARE created equal,"Having lived through this period, this is a rather personal and emotional film to me. This film did not make a lot of money, which is a shame as this is a history of how gay men & women have progressed to where they are today. People like Harvey Milk are responsible for the evolution of civil rights and he deserves to be remembered for what he achieved during his short time. As a film, this is remarkably well written, though some things and characters are necessarily sketchy simply due to time constrictions. The archival footage is wonderful and harsh and to today's young LGBTQ people the footage of being dragged off to jail, being beaten, being crucified by the church must seem unbelievable, though the latter certainly is still going full steam, though ultimately it will be to no avail. If watching this film and then taking a look at where LGBTQ are people today does not show to the entire country how the advancement of these people's civil rights has been an ongoing growing achievement then they are both being seen through blind eyes. This is not a cinematic masterpiece, though Gus Van Sant's career is full of fascinating films, but it a very intelligent, extremely well made and mostly brilliantly acted film. I have never been a big fan of Sean Penn, but this is his ultimate triumph. He just simply morphs into this role and is a complete delight to behold. Josh Brolin is also excellent. He is never written or played as a villain, though he ultimately is. James Franco gives a warm, loving and sincere performance. This is an important as well as entertaining piece of civil rights history and while the most well known comment made by Milk has always been ""My name is Harvey Milk and I am here to recruit you"", the most important line in this movie is based on the Declaration of Independence. All men are created equal. No matter how hard you try, you can never erase those words.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Very well done, very very very by-the-book stuff.","It was very well done, very very very by-the-book stuff. Some of the photography was bad, which helps it blend in with the archive stuff, I know, but still.The cast was good, though now and again Penn or Hirsch got pretty damned close to parody. But then, so do queens, so...*shrugs*I found myself checking my watch way too often. Milk himself wasn't very interesting to me, which basically just left the cause itself, and as much as the story centered on that, there was a serious lack of urgency. The most moving moment in the entire film is almost thrown away: a cop refers to a dead man's boyfriend as his ""trick""; Milk responds that he wasn't his ""trick,"" he was his ""lover"" (or ""boyfriend"" -- I can't remember the term used). The cop again casually dismissed the man as the corpse's ""trick"" and Milk again responds that he wasn't his ""trick,"" he was his ""lover""... He's just trying to get through to the cop the idea that a gay man has humanity and it's sad, horrifying, poignant -- everything the entire film should have been.Too bad. I'm definitely a Van Sant fan, but this wasn't much better than good.7.25/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Just another bio-flick.,"I recently saw a screener of this movie and was very excited about it cause I'm usually very fond of Sean Penn's work and very intrigued by Van Sant's to say the least.In general, I liked it. It has roughly everything a bio-flick is supposed to have and it tries to stay on the personal side of the story while it portrays the bigger issue which is that of the gay rights and freedom. Wheather it managed this I guess it's a matter of personal opinion and of what's more important to the individual viewer. Myself, although I'm totally for the equality of rights and freedom of individuals or groups, I wanted a little more personal touch and a deeper dig into Milk's life and character. It only felt like I didn't get to know him properly and understand why he did some or most of the things that he did even though I could see exactly where he was coming from, facing some of those same issues myself. This obviously is a shortcoming of the script or the final editing which might have left out many things. Still, the story in general feels almost complete and acceptable. It managed to touch me deeply and even make me cry by the end.In relation to the acting, I don't think there's anything to complain about. Everyone was very good or even better than good, but I wouldn't start handing out Oscars just yet. Sean Penn was very good but to be honest he did nothing that we haven't seen yet. It seems to me that this role was a very obvious attempt to land him another Academy Award or a nomination at least but I for once won't be convinced so easily. It has become like the latest craze to have straight actors play gay people and then applaud and award them for the ""magnificient performance"" and the ""accurate and very real"" portrayal of the faggot. But in my opinion that's the easiest part; everyone can play the faggot. How about having a real gay actor play Milk's role, or that of the boyfriend, or that of the other gay people in this movie? It irritates me that even Van Sant - a director who for years now has fabulously brought the gay world more out of the closet than anyone else, - falls prey to one of the biggest paradoxes out there, that of the Hollywood - maybe the most important and leading institute to proclaim and sustain gay rights and yet the most homophobic yet. Just ask yourselves, how many openly gay actors do you know that are still very successful and have a very high profiled career still going strong? Van Sant (or the production company) clearly and easily could have used (at least more) gay actors in this cast, but I guess that would turn it into a gay movie and of course it wouldn't sell.So please forgive me if I don't applaud Penn or Franco for their sincere acting, or nominate any of the cast & crew for an award, cause in the end this movie is just another silly paradox to me.7 out of 10 for the effort and cinematic value.

When I heard of the assassination of San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and City Supervisor Harvey Milk I had little idea what it meant, aside the tragedy of two lives stolen through murder.The film tells as much a civil rights story as it does the personal story of Harvey Milk. Sean Penn gives such a convincing performance I'm frequently believing I'm watching Milk, but Penn isn't the only strong performance in this film, the entire cast is strong and I feel I'm watching history re-enacted in the place and time of events.How faithful is Milk to actual history? That I cannot say, aside liberties must have been taken at various points because the dead are not here to tell how it was, but as a film underscoring a branch of civil rights it makes a convincing point.

Definitely Skim Milk,"Despite being gay and having most of my friends praise ""Milk"" I must disagree. While Sean Penn's performance was Oscar-worthy and there was much to like, overall it was another Gus Van Sant bore. First of all it was much too dark. I doubt these vibrant people had so many meetings by low lamplight. Much of the conversation was muddled. The story thread was confusing. And there was no character development. Who was Milk? Why did he tolerate his last lover's looniness. Plus all the characters were your basic cliché queens. Surely there must have been one manly gay hanging around, after all bars everywhere are full of them. The Dan White role, while well-played, was totally undeveloped. Who was he? What did he really want? What was his family life like?

One of the greatest biographical films ever made,"Great story, very engaging. It is lead by fantastic performances and amazing writing and direction.Sean Penn gives one of the best male performances of the decade for sure. He captures so realistically what many other actors in the past have done with real life people. He captures all of Harvey Milk's mannerisms and emotion so well. He will certainly get an Oscar nomination, possibly even a win. Now, to the strong supporting performances. Many of the attention has been given to Brolin and Franco, but I thought that Diego Luna gave a very disturbing and real portrayal as Milk's lover, Jack at one point in his life. Yes, it was hard to watch, but I feel that Luna really stood-out, and it is a shame that people have not really recognized him as well. James Franco also gave a very strong performance, as did Emile Hirsch. But, here is a surprise, I did not think Josh Brolin was anything special. He has been the supporting actor who has been getting most Oscar attention, and most nominations and even awards. He was good, no doubt, but he lacked a lot in scenes I thought. I was expecting him to do more, and I am sorry, but I do not think he deserves an Oscar nomination, let alone some awards he has taken home(they should all go to Ledger for his amazing performance as The Joker). But it is not a big deal, like I said, he was good, but just not nearly as good as he is being praised. The screenplay is fabulous. It slides, and it does not linger, and never plays out very easily. The direction is superb, as is the rest of the film.Here is one amazing film, by any means. It grabs you, whether you like biographical films or not. It is a film, and all of the characters you deeply connect with. Certainly one of the year's best films.",,Anonymous,Biography

A well deserved Oscar and an excellent cast. It teaches a major historical and political event for gays (the movie is based more on men) and teaches what people who are different than what most would consider ""normal"" have to go through. Costume design very good, they have stayed true to what was in fashion then. My favorite scenes are when they win the vote against the No 6 law, and the final scene where all gays holding candles walk the streets, mourning for Milk.My favorite quote: Dan White: Society can't exist without the family.

Gotta Give 'em Hope,"Greetings again from the darkness. Bio-Drama based on the political rise of Harvey Milk, the first openly gay man elected to office, is much more than that. It is a reminder of just how ridiculous and closed minded the establishment was just 30 short years ago. Seeing Anita Bryant brought back some scary memories and reminds us just how important it is to understand an issue PRIOR to passing judgment.Sean Penn turns in yet another of his seemingly endless top-notch performances. However, this time he is not the brooding, mumbling type ... he is the action-oriented, quick thinking, charismatic leader of the gay movement in the 70's, and he is spot on as Harvey Milk. The film does not portray Milk as a perfect man, but does spend most of the time on his mission to be elected in order to provide a voice for the gay movement.Excellent support work by Emile Hirsch and James Franco, and Josh Brolin takes on the tough role of Dan Brown, a good man who just couldn't understand why people listened to Milk instead of him. I can't comment on Diego Luna's performance, because it is extremely flamboyant. My guess is that is probably an accurate portrayal of Milk's lover.Director Gus Van Sant (Good Will Hunting, Drugstore Cowboy) does a masterful job of capturing the feel of the times through sets and a mixture of news footage and other actual video. We get a feel for the cause without dwelling on the discrimination and outright abuse that this group absorbed.

No masterpiece,"It's often difficult to provide commentary on a movie with such a heated topic. It seems that whatever you say, you're always conscious that someone may consider you a ""homophobe"" (whatever that is) or that you're skirting the issue. However, I feel I have a pretty good compass as a movie fan: I can judge a film strictly on its own merits. Having said that, I rate ""Milk"" as a slightly better-than-average biopic, not a masterpiece, as breathless critics fell over themselves to proclaim. Again, I feel the same way about actors. While I personally despise everything Sean Penn stands for, I've always said I believe he is one of our finest actors today. However, I still didn't feel he put in Oscar-worthy work here. The movie just seemed to drag in parts and, while it held my interest, it just didn't enrapture me.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Easily One Of The Best Films Of 2008,"Sean Penn has matured into a finer than fine actor,director & political activist since he gave McDonna....um, I mean Madonna the option of hitting the road (which could be the same for Guy Ritchie). He also became more choosy about scripts. 'Milk' is hands down obvious of that. Unless you've been living in a cave in Tibet for the past thirty odd years, Harvey Milk was the first openly gay man to be elected into office in San Francisco in the later half of the 1970's. Penn plays Milk with a passion that could only be equaled to Jimmy Stewart in 'Mr. Smith Goes To Washington'. Gus Van Sant makes a grand return to quality film making, after directing some uneven ""art films"", which have mostly played to empty cinema seats,rather than paying customers. The cast is rounded out by Josh Brolin,who plays political rival,Dan White,who shot Milk, as well as (then)San Francisco mayor,George Moscone in 1978. Milk spoke not just for the gay community,but for senior citizens,blue collar workers,and the rest of the public,in general. This film is obviously being released now,as potential contender for the Academy Award (it sure deserves it). We'll have to see what happens next year. Passed with an 'R' rating by the MPAA,this film has some nudity,sexuality,language & some violence (but nothing too graphic or bloody).",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Sean Penn in one of his best!,I always liked Sean Penn's range of characters but never had such appreciation or respect for his great work until now. This portrayal was brave and accurate in a way that only Mr. Penn could make it. The picture tried not only to portray a true story but manages to send a necessary message as well. Gus Van Sant is a brilliant and gifted director who just added another notch to his great catalog of films. James Franco and the rest of the cast are also to be rewarded for giving their hearts to a movie and message that is just as important and relevant today as it was many years ago.

A Character Study Without Character... Development That Is,"Milk is nothing more than a character study. It focuses exclusively on the life of Harvey Milk, the first openly-gay politician in the United States. Unfortunately, Sean Penn portrays Milk as a one-dimensional caricature akin to a SNL sketch. So, if Milk offers us nothing more than a character study, and there isn't any character to study, I am inclined to believe that the film is about nothing.Sure, there are some social criticisms mentioned. But they are generic and almost literally spelled out for the audience (ex. ""Be yourself"").Despite these fatal criticisms of the main performance and script, the Academy honored both with an Oscar.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good Enough for a God?,"There's a scene early in this film that is reprised at the end. our hero at 40 says he's done nothing he is proud of, nothing that mattered. Then we follow him in the next 8 years until his death, where he -- we are convinced -- has. Its a patriotic story, and I cried. But the timing is bad for this effect, because its quite clear that in real terms we are not much better off as a nation after thirty years.The country is more driven by Christian fundamentalism than ever, and remains more fundamentalist than, say, Pakistan. Gays are even more attractive scapegoats for rousing the base than ever before. Though the Anita Bryant of the events we see was publicly humiliated, we manufacture Anita substitutes in large numbers.This ran through my mind, because though the life we see may have seemed significant, I wonder. And the same can be said of the film, and that's what this comment is about.Van Sant knows how to make an effective film. This has all sorts of narrative devices based on recall, each of which reinforce the others.Its framed by a tape made by the soon-to-be-murdered activist. It merges staged drama with real news footage (peppered with fake ones). It merges real and imagined threads in his life. Most profoundly, it merges clear ""modern"" visions of the Castro in its day with seemingly genuine footage as we would see it today: grainy, jerky, dated dyes. There are other intermingling of things from the time with modern ones. We notice them because the times are so close. Simple things like colloquialisms, political notions. Bigger things like the carriage of key characters, the cadence of speeches, even street chats.This is all to say that there is a lot of very clever engineering here to fold us into the thing, its times and energies. But is it good enough?Sure, we are glad that a ""movement"" was started. We celebrate his life at the end as we are supposed to. But is the project strong enough to change us? Surely I have encountered films that are powerful enough to turn lives, to crease souls. Does this material deserve something like that, or is it enough to make us feel right for its last hour? Can you have a powerful film and a simple celebration? Can significant true events be recounted in a way that causes more significant events  which is to ask whether the true can come from the true.I only know that this film was fine. It worked well enough to engage and elicit patriotic urges. But I know it isn't good enough.

A good true movie about an American gay activist in the '70's.,"This movie tells the true story of Harvey Bernard Milk, a gay activist who became a politician in order to bring the fight for equal rights to an higher level. Through his power in office he gets the things done that live on the streets, among the gay community.Quite amazing though- and also sad, that the things in this movie actually truly happened. It's great that there was a person such as Harvey Milk but it's sad that there actually had to be a person such as him in the first place to fight for the rights of gay persons.""Milk"" is an inspirational movie about a inspirational and brave person, who really got things done in the short amount of time that he was fully involved in politics. The movie is suffering from some of the same problem as most other biopics though. It shows that it's almost impossible to tell a persons life and his life work in such a short time span. It now is basically the story of Harvey Milk in a nutshell and the movie often makes jumps and the pace is at all times high, which keeps the story going, without ever giving you a moments rest really. This is the main reason why I'm growing less fond of biographic movies. The story of this movie feels like it could had told and delivered so much more. Harvey Milk was a important figure in the fight for gay rights in the '70's and his work in San Fransisco reached out to the rest of the United States as well.Still it's a movie that gets the benefit of the doubt because of its Oscar winning story and the message that this movie sends across. Homosexuality is still a bit of a sensitive subject on which still lays a big taboo in America. This movie had the guts to tell this story and it's also not afraid to show the 'open' sides of the gay community as it is, so you can expect seeing lots of kissing man in this movie, as well as a couple of sex scenes between persons of the same sex.Also a daring brave role from Sean Penn of course, as well as from the other heterosexual actors within the movie, playing homosexual characters. It's not easy playing such an openly gay person when you self are an heterosexual person. It takes really guts, class and talents to act like that in front of the camera and this is also the foremost reason why Sean Penn won an Oscar for his role in this movie. Some other fine actors that appear in this movie are Josh Brolin, James Franco, Diego Luna and new star Emile Hirsch.A great relevant movie, from director Gus Van Sant, who shows good form again with this movie.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Much to be commended but ultimately uninvolving,"Milk has a lot in it that is very good. The cinematography, by Harris Savides, is beautiful, as is the original music by Danny Elfman. I deeply admired Sean Penn's bravura performance in the title role, his Best Actor Oscar was well deserved. Josh Brolin, as Milk's killer Dan White also gave an affecting performance.Now to what I liked less. Despite a well written screenplay, for which Dustin Lance Black won an Oscar, I found the story rather uninteresting. But blame that on me, not Milk. Milk's activism in support of gay rights was always a mixed bag to me. He was absolutely right to fight tooth and nail against the anti-gay and homophobic attitudes of Anita Bryant and her fellow True Believers who supported the viciously repressive Proposition 6. Nevertheless, Milk's harsh criticism of gays who wanted to keep quiet about their orientation always made me uncomfortable. That decision should always be a matter of personal choice and not questioned in an attempt to gain more political power, or so it seems to me.I should observe finally that Harvey Milk was a powerhouse, a charming, charismatic leader, so he was appropriately celebrated in this film. On balance, I give Milk a marginal recommendation, 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
No Factual Errors!  I Was There,"I was totally blown away, even more so because I knew many of the characters in the movie including Harvey and Scott. This is the most accurate bio-pic I have ever seen. I was there.I could not find a single historical flaw in the story worth mentioning, not even the long walking scene Dan White took from Moscone to Milk's office, which seems wrong but was entirely accurate. Oh, and Harvey is not portrayed as a saint, especially in the deal-making.""Milk"" deserves at least 4 Oscar nominations (best screenplay, direction, actor, and supporting). It's that good.""Milk"" is not only a great film, but an important one as well as it shows a time when there was heavy anti-gay discrimination in San Francisco, something that younger people are unaware of. Civil rights weren't suddenly gotten; they didn't suddenly appear. They were won through hard work, the hard work that broke up relationships (including the two in Harvey's life as shown in the film). Prop 6, the Briggs Initiative, portrayed in the movie was just one example of the kinds of things facing us that we had to overcome.For people who see ""Milk"" please realize that you are seeing truth. It was a different world then, and hopefully a world we won't have to go back to.""Milk"" is playing at the Castro Theatre in SF, and it is historically best to see it there as you can then walk outside and see the spots where history was made.I urge folks to NOT see it in a Century or a CineArts Theater until the Texas-based CEO, Alan Stock, apologizes for his $10,000 contribution to the California Yes on 8 (anti-same sex marriage) campaign and donates at least an equal amount of money to a pro-same sex marriage cause.Sean Penn is astounding in the movie, especially since he was able to convey the essence and the fun pranking of a man he never knew.

Its a combination of documentary and drama. Some of the drama becomes repetitive - there are many scenes of boy-meet-boy which becomes somewhat like an afternoon soap opera.

"Compelling, Interesting, Educational and excellent docudrama in which Sean Penn is fantastic you will cheer for him!","Just recently saw this film, and I can certainly see why many are calling ""Milk"" one of the best films of 2008. At the end you will stand and cheer due to the performance given by Sean Penn as Harvey Milk who was the first openly gay elected politician to serve in this country. No matter what your political stance is, or no matter what your take is on social and moral issues of our time like homosexuality this masterpiece of a docudrama is moving and touching for the way it shows how history was changed somewhat by one Harvey Milk. Director Gus Van Sant one who is excellent at doing docudramas intersects this film along just fine by showing Milk's relationships with lovers(played by James Franco and Diego Luna)also well displayed is Milk's offbeat sense of humor and his uncanny ability to attract followers all which tie in well with what he was able to accomplish in California's era of a gay ballot proposition proposal.Anyway call him unifier, politician, fighter, icon, inspiration, or hero. Harvey Milk and his life changed history and his courage changed lives. This film to me a good historical docudrama charts mostly the last eight years of Harvey's life starting with Milk in New York City at the age of 40, and clearly Harvey feels he hasn't done a thing in his life so looking for more purpose along with his lover they relocate to San Francisco, California. Here they open up a small business shop called Castro Camera in the heart of a working class place that will soon become a stomping ground for gay people from all around the country. This set in the mid 70's a time when many cities especially San Francisco were experiencing big social movements and outcries from gays. And with this message and the city of San Fran empowering him Milk finally surprises everyone and becomes an outspoken agent for change and notice for all homosexuals by seeking equal rights and opportunities for them all. As the film shows it was a struggle too as this was a time when violence against gays was openly accepted. So in a challenging and compelling twist Milk decides to take a swim into the murky and wavy waters of us guessed it politics.After three unsuccessful attempts at his run for a San Franciso supervisor seat on his fourth run in 1977 Harvey was finally elected to the board of supervisors which was helped out by the newly rezoned district 5. And Milk serves well by fighting for citywide ordinances that protect people from being fired because of their sexual preferences. Yet as shown in the film by real live news reel footage on a nationwide level(good show of realism by Van Sant)Milk knows he's in for a real battle from Christian conservatives and right wing republicans. To add to the drama of the film the political agenda of Harvey is threatened by a newly elected supervisor Dan White(Josh Brolin who is super he always gives us our moneys worth)this all leads to a dangerous and tragically unexpected end for Milk in 1978.Really what more can I say clearly ""Milk"" is one of the best docudramas ever made it's a stirring take on the political process that took an outspoken social stand not only for gays, but for Americans that it urges them to get involved and make things happen. Overall great time period piece a fine historical docudrama with a super direction from Van Sant and the supporting performances from Brolin, Emile Hirsch, Diego Luna, and James Franco are great. Most of all Sean Penn is in fantastic form as Harvey Milk his performance is powerful maybe one of the best in film history, he's one of the best actors around Sean gets so involved with his roles. So no matter if your liberal or conservative you will stand up and cheer when you see ""Milk"" an excellent film one of 2008's best.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""You gotta give them hope.""","Every now and then, a movie comes around that's too timely and poignant for words. This year, that film is 'Milk'. Not only a superbly crafted American film, but a vastly important one at that. Gus Van Sant's portrait of this nation's first openly gay man elected to public office is a stirring and compelling look into the birth of a revolution whose struggles continue today. 'Milk' speaks to the heart of a generation, and with a message of acceptance that should be seen by all.'Milk' first comes to us with a montage of grainy black-and-white file footage of men being arrested and led out of homosexual bars. It then cuts to Harvey Milk, sitting alone at a kitchen table speaking into a tape recorder. A tape that, Harvey tell us, is only to be played in the event of his assassination. It is his story that becomes the framework of this deeply affecting biopic, one that speaks to events today as much as they did when 'Milk' would unfold in the 70s. It is Gus Van Sant's decision to use such file footage throughout the film to enhance its own reality. This is real, this happened.Sean Penn. What can you say? 'Milk' takes us on a journey, but Sean Penn takes us to the soul of a man. A man who has stood up for what he believes in, a man who will stand idle no more. Sean disappears into Harvey and delivers a deeply human performance, one that blew me away with such passion and determinism. Here is a man who refuses to quit even when staring defeat in the face. No mountain, however high or steep, is ever impossible to climb. His struggle becomes the voice of a movement to grant equal rights for all, no matter your sexual orientation. A tragic revolution that almost forces an entire population to make their case for simple civil rights.Though Penn's amazing performance may very well be the highlight of this film, there's no overlooking a strong supporting cast that surrounds Penn. Included is James Franco, who continues to prove his worth as an actor. Playing one of Penn's partners, Franco takes advantage of a small role and makes the very most out of it. It's a star turn for Franco, who is also joined by scene-stealing Emile Hirsch, Alison Pill, and Joseph Cross. It is Josh Brolin who portrays Milk's colleague Dan White, a man tortured by his own beliefs and the changing landscape. It would be White who ultimately took the lives of Milk and Mayor Moscone.'Milk' is not your typical Hollywood biopic. It doesn't bubble over with sensational claims and depictions. It's neither the image of a larger-than-life character who struck big-time with overwhelming fame or fortune. It is a story to believe in, to draw hope and strength from. It is not strictly a gay movie, I honestly believe anyone will find an inspirational note to walk away with. To overcome one's persecutions is to uphold one of our most timeless creeds: the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And though Milk's life ended in unspeakable tragedy, his bravery inspired millions to rise up.'Milk' first showed us a gay oppression at the hands of the law. It leaves us with a candlelight vigil marching through the streets of San Francisco. It is singularly the most emotional and powerful moment in this wonderful film. We're taken back to Harvey sitting at his kitchen table, reflecting on his life and preparing for the worst. ""Life's not worth living without hope,"" he tells us. ""You gotta give them hope.""

Penn brings his unique soul to a less than inspiring script,"Perhaps it is because I know the story of Milk and was involved in the women's movement at the time, but there is somehow a piece missing. I understand the growth of a movement. However as I watched the deterioration of Dan White, I learned no more than the magazine articles. Penn was wonderful but failed to pull me into Milk's circle. Josh Brolin was superb. With each appearance we see his hyper-disaster growing and growing and like a car wreck it's impossible to keep your eyes from his face. The significant question beats louder and louder as surely it must have for Moscone and Milk. Why? Perhaps I am too familiar with the times, the tools and the motion of a movement. It is aptly named Milk as it is his movie and his passion.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Sorry, not for me","I tried very hard to watch Milk, as Sean Penn is a very good actor and he deserves an Oscar or two. But I just could not get into this film. About 10 minutes into the film, found my mind wondering about I was going to have for dinner. About 20 minutes into it, I got bored and restless. Then I started to tapping my feet - I really need to go to the shop to get bread, coffee and something for my dog.And the story was very interesting truthful at first glance,which is why I purchased a ticket with my friends. I guess it lagged in some areas and slowed to a crawl in scenes. Not sure whether it was the screen writers fault or the director. Sadly, I lost interest in the movie, and prayed it would hurry up and end. Toilet break was a blessing, even visiting the food stall levitate the zombie like state I was in.

The Mayor of Castro Street.,"Closet homosexual New Yorker Harvey Milk (played superbly by the exceptional Sean Penn) decides to go to San Francisco in the early-1970s with young lover James Franco and live openly as a gay couple. By the middle of the decade the titled character is trying to reach political office with the hopes of becoming the first openly gay elected official in U.S. history. As the pre-AIDS 1970s continues, gay rights becomes one of the most heated and controversial issues of the contemporary time period. Marked with triumphs and ultimate tragedy, the film is a would-be powerhouse combination of gifted direction (by the always dependable Gus Van Sant), interesting commentary, and a dynamic leading man (Penn) seemingly making all supporting players around him better (most notably antagonist Josh Brolin as a highly conservative elected official who appears to have potential homosexual tendencies of his own). The subject matter is highly mature, the movie's pace is questionable at times, and the film is definitely flawed in many key areas. However, Van Sant's gifted story-telling ability (along with the use of historical archives and news footage) makes ""Milk"" a fascinating film, albeit a somewhat over-rated one. Greatly influenced by the Best Documentary Feature Oscar winner ""The Times of Harvey Milk"" which was produced in 1984. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Biography
Believe the hype.,"Pretty much perfect. I do have one complaint with the film though; we should have seen more Dan White. It felt like they just spaced out scenes for him where he showed up every ten minutes after his first appearance and each scene of his was a big block of character development. It did a good job of demonstrating what led him to kill Harvey Milk, but didn't give us a chance to sympathize with him or even really understand why he did it beyond the basics. I felt like there was a lot more depth to him beneath the surface and while Josh Brolin did a great job of showing the insecurities and anger of the character internally, I wanted to see his flaws fleshed out more in the actual story instead of just in Brolin's performance. Aside from that, I have no complaints with the film.I've seen a lot of people call it an unconventional biopic, and while I can't really agree with that, it's definitely the pinnacle of a biopic. I'm tempted to say that Sean Penn has never been better than he is here and I'm struggling to think of a reason why that wouldn't be true. People say it about performances all of the time, but it's really true here; Sean Penn became Harvey Milk. He embodied the life and soul of Milk and completely disappears into the character. It's one of those cases where you think he's not really doing anything impressive...but that's what makes it so impressive. He lives and breathes the character so much that it just becomes his natural persona for the duration of the film and you don't realize just how brilliant he was until it's all over and you think 'That was Sean Penn that entire time.' An impeccable performance if I ever saw one. No one can beat Sam Rockwell (in Snow Angels) for me this year, but since he's not a contender I'm throwing my hat in the 'Give Sean Penn another Oscar.' ring as of now.Gus Van Sant's direction was superb; he used the technique of bleeding real footage into the movie footage that we've seen before, but something about the way he did it made it all feel very organic which I loved. He made everything lively and fresh while not getting in the way of the actors doing their jobs and that's pretty hard to find. The screenplay incorporated all of these big, epic moments of Milk's history into the story of his personal and political life without missing a beat or making anything feel like 'Oh, this is just building up to that big speech.' which is a problem that occurs with a lot of biopics. Danny Elfman's score ranges from emotionally powerful to beautiful to quietly haunting without getting in the way of the rest of the story. It's my favorite of the year so far. The cinematography gave a very intimate feel to everything from the first love scene between Milk and James Franco's character Scott Smith to those big speeches and marches unlike most films where they make those moments seem grand and out-of-this-world. But here everything is very 'in the moment' throughout.And finally, the acting from the entire cast is brilliant. Penn leads the front with an Oscar-worthy portrayal. Josh Brolin is emotional and painfully insecure in his own body. James Franco goes from being the gorgeous, flirty young boy to a brooding man who just wants to be with the man he loves but that man is too busy focusing on much grander things. Emile Hirsch is adorable, driven and wildly charismatic. And the rest of the campaign cast did a great job of blending organically into their roles.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Extraordinary,"My knowledge of Harvey Milk's story prior to walking into Gus Van Sant's extraordinary drama of the life and times of the openly gay politician was vague at best. I knew he was the first elected municipal leader to be openly gay in US history and I knew he was assassinated. However, as his story unfolded, I learned just how important this man is to American history and just how much he truly was the Martin Luther King of the Gay Rights Civil movement by how much he pushed it forward by leaps and bounds.Part of me wishes this film had been released prior to the US elections as it could have had a ripple effect and helped prevent the human rights disaster that is California's Proposition 8 from ever passing. However, I believe it could still have a huge hand in changing the ideals and the thoughts of many of the ignorant masses if they actually just gave two hours of their life to watch what this man did for the people, the city of San Francisco, the state of California, if not the nation.Sean Penn in the lead role is undeniably one of the strongest performances, if not the strongest performance, of the year, if not his career. The gage of true talent is when an actor who has so much history and is so well known actually makes you forget you are watching them. Penn became Milk in all his homosexual glory. As his lover of many years, James Franco, best known as a pseudo teen heartthrob, proves he may have what it takes for longevity giving a strong supporting performance that also has been causing whispers of Oscar nomination. Admittedly, the first time you see these two manly-men-like actors kiss, it may cause you to gigglebut it's because they jump into it before you've had a chance to even settle into your seat. But soon, you forget who you're watching and the two become nothing but their characters and you feel a natural love between the two like any other on-screen couple.Emile Hirsch, highly praised for last year's Into the Wild, is almost unrecognizable as one of Milk's devout supporters, Cleve Jones, and could be invited to Oscar night as well. Even Josh Brolin's turn as obviously-closeted Dan White, one of San Francisco's other elected reps who went on to assassinate Milk and mayor George Moscone, offered up an incredibly strong, subtle performance.No doubt, this film could potentially get a lot of attention from the Academy if the film is not deemed ""to gay"" by its members. Brokeback Mountain may have gotten a lot of attention, but its heterosexual elements may have helped that. There is nothing heterosexual about Milk, the man and the film. This may be the gayest major-studio film ever made which may hurt or harm its chances come Oscar night.We can only hope this film gets the credit it deserves across the board, especially for Sean Penn. To paraphrase Alan Ball, Oscar-winning writer of American Beauty and creator and Executive Producer of HBO's ""Six Feet Under,"" a straight actor taking on a gay role is no longer an act of bravery, however a straight actor refusing to play gay is an act of cowardice. Sean Penn may not have been brave by taking on the role of Harvey Milk, but his portrayal of this man made Milk's monumental bravery crystal clear. Harvey Milk is a hero.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

2) The film suffers from a problem most biopics do: there are frequent montages and fast forwards in order to try and cram everything into one film

Wonderfully-made and inspiring,"""Milk"" is so good that immediately after it was over, I wanted to stay in the theater and watch the whole thing again. I went into the movie with high expectations, and, while it took me a little bit to get used to the movie's fast pace, I wasn't disappointed.I spent months before the film's release reading about Harvey Milk, and while ""Milk"" shifts a few facts (example: he met Scott on his forty-first birthday, not his fortieth, and by then he was already a hippie who hadn't worked in insurance for the last few years) and simplifies others (in the interest of time, his connection with the Peoples Temple is completely skipped), it's true to the essence of the man who went from being a semi-closeted New Yorker, with few accomplishments to his name, to the first openly gay man elected to public office in America. The acting is uniformly excellent and there's no sense that the filmmakers are trying to make anyone a pure hero or a pure villain, even the unbalanced-yet-pitiable Dan White.Sean Penn portrays Harvey Milk as a genuinely kind and good-humored man who sometimes lets his newfound goals and ambitions take priority over his personal relationships; James Franco is quietly devoted as Scott Smith, Harvey's boyfriend who leaves him when he grows tired of the endless campaigning but is still always there when Harvey needs him. Perhaps one of the most fun performances to watch is Emile Hirsch as Cleve Jones, who begins the film as a bratty part-time prostitute but evolves into a tireless activist who, we can tell, is going to be the one to pick up where Harvey left off. Diego Luna plays Jack Lira, Harvey's sexy yet clearly disturbed post-Scott boyfriend, and Josh Brolin is surprisingly sympathetic as Dan White, Harvey's Board of Supervisors colleague who will seek Harvey's friendship despite a personal opposition to homosexuality, feel an overwhelming sense of betrayal when Harvey votes against him on his pet project, and eventually kill him out of envy and revenge. Alison Pill, Joseph Cross, and Lucas Grabeel are among the actors who play Harvey's campaign workers; one of the things that makes this movie enjoyable is the sense of camaraderie among Harvey's friends and supporters. You wish you could go over to Castro Camera and hang out with them yourself.Harvey is so likable as a character that I spent a large portion of this movie smiling just watching him. He's charming, funny, and gives everyone a fair chance; while his friends dismiss Dan White, Harvey insists that Dan ""will be fine"" and can be educated. At the same time, he's definitely flawed, with a sometimes questionable taste in men (none of his friends can understand why he stays with Jack, who drinks too much and has temper tantrums) and a willingness at times to trample people's feelings in the name of the greater good. There's a scene where he decides that all his campaign workers have to come out immediately, including a young man named Dick Pabich, who Harvey insists has to call his father this very minute even though Dick looks as though he'd rather hide under a rock. It may be his decision to ignore Dan White's feelings that seals his fate.While the movie never excuses Dan's actions, we understand his frustration and rage. He takes a huge step out of his comfort zone to try to be Harvey's friend (there are hints that he subconsciously wishes their relationship went beyond friendship, but this is never presented as a certainty, only a possibility) and is personally hurt when the courtesy he extends to Harvey isn't reciprocated. He has no friends on the Board of Supervisors and is struggling to support a wife and baby on a tiny salary. While he can't get one single thing he wants, Harvey's becoming a media superstar.Even after they've broken up, Harvey and Scott have one of the sweetest gay relationships I've seen in any movie. The chemistry is strong from the moment a nervous-yet-charismatic Harvey picks up Scott, a cute hippie, in a subway station on his fortieth birthday, and every time they kiss, hug, make love, or even just talk as Harvey makes dinner, we can tell they're crazy about each other. When Scott leaves we want Harvey to get him back or die trying, and after they break up we keep hoping they're going to reconcile.I've spent most of this review talking about the interpersonal relationships, as opposed to the gay rights element, because they're so essential to the story, but the gay rights element is also excellently-done and inspiring. Watching the various protests and marches is exciting, and it's fun seeing Harvey debate anti-gay crusaders until their logic collapses on itself. Despite various tragedies, the final feeling the film leaves you with is one of hope - which, I think, is how Harvey would have wanted it. Definitely see this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Penn turns in a masterful performance,"One thing can for sure be said about Milk (2008), and that is that Sean Penn turns in a masterful, beyond accurate performance. He portrays gay rights advocate Harvey Milk wonderfully. And James Franco is great here too, I absolutely loved him and his character in this film. The chemistry between Penn and Franco is believable and I for one really rooted for their relationship. Josh Brolin plays murderer Dan White very accurately, and I commend him on a great performance. Dustin Lance Black wrote a great award winning script that works so well for the film. And the love/romantic scenes between Milk and his lovers are well shot and tastefully done. The movie shows the ups and downs of milk's life and how he fought tooth and nail for LGBT rights in San Francisco, California, and ultimately across the United States. I do personally feel like the movie could have been just a little stronger overall, but I still feel like this was a great representation of Harvey Milk's remarkable life. Milk (2008) receives a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A Much-Needed Biopic of Perhaps the Most Important Politician of the Last Half of the 20th Century, As Well As a Blow to the Nuts of Prop 8","After seeing Milk, a much-needed biopic of perhaps the most important politician of the last half of the 20th century, I have a renewed respect for Sean Penn. He is among the contemporary powerhouse testosterone-heads like De Niro, Pacino, Hoffman, Hopper, Nicholson, you know, swarthy New Yorkers who use heavy method acting despite today's cynicism towards it. He was at one time the prototypical Hollywood punk who punched extras and photographers, did drugs and chain-smoked. Here he faithfully and lovingly reflects one of the most honest, understanding and loyal people in history, to an extent that none of his said peers have shown the balls to.I see this film as not only a product of incredible dramatic and visual talent but also a righteous breakthrough of humanity in a most trying time for it. We never hear about the countless important gay men and women in history, but now Gus Van Sant, himself gay, has at last given us an accessible mainstream movie about one of them. To prove a significance for themselves today, when their basic rights are still being challenged, they, and we, have to relate to one of them in the past, as this film makes clear.Harvey Milk became the first openly gay American elected to public office. He made a prevailing plea to closeted gays to come out to their families, friends and co-workers, so the straight world could stop vilifying a theoretical, nonrepresentational perception. But so influential was the movement he was key in motivating that I believe his demand has now virtually been regarded, apart from some willfully primitive regions of the country.Van Sant's masterpiece begins with Milk remembering into his tape recorder about an individual passage that sparked at the ripe age of 40! At that cut-off point, he grew discontented with his life, determined he wanted to really accomplish something. A Republican stock researcher, he mingled with hippies in Greenwich and tiptoed the closet door, waving out hesitantly. He was in love with Scott Smith, played so becomingly by the underused James Franco. This is all absorbed from one scene, shot in a single, mostly stationary take. They moved to San Francisco, opened a camera shop and saw that even America's leading, most strident gay community was being methodically victimized by police.What made Milk such an effective politician was that he didn't go into politics as much as he was pressed by the motivating proof he witnessed every day. He ran for the Board of Supervisors three times before being elected. He campaigned for a gay rights ordinance. He organized. His tongue was always in his cheek yet he always helped as much as he could. He built a coalition with liberals, unions, longshoremen, teachers, Hispanics, blacks and others with shared needs for equality. He ripened his gift for public relations. He became an invigorating spokesman. By now branded the Mayor of Castro Street, he secured public office. It was an oppressive platform from which to confront firebrands like fagnostic Anita Bryant, who Milk would taunt with his wisdom and confidence by calling her always by her first name.Beautifully crafted, enveloping massive amounts of time, people and spirit without a frame of half-heartedness or drained momentum, this tenderly handled picture tells the story of its hero's ascent from disgruntled middle-aged hippie to nationwide icon. Entwined are his romances. He remained dormantly in love with Scott after they separated due to his political concentration. He is instinctively caring even of a second lover who becomes irrationally resentful of his political life, when the practical thing would be to sever the bond.His most critical rapport was with Dan White, an apparently straight fellow supervisor, a Catholic who said homosexuality was a sin and canvassed with his family in red, white and blue. A thorny pact formed between Milk and White. If I were to criticize the film at all, I would lament that the depiction of the camaraderie between Milk and Mayor George Moscone is given far too little screen time.There is no misstep in the taut, multi-faceted screenplay, the potent cast or the first-class technical film-making. There is not one shot that isn't given rich creative nuance. What's more, the film is so faithful to its period that it seamlessly uses stock shots wherever possible, opening with archives of police raiding gay bars, then Dianne Feinstein's announcement that Milk and Moscone had been assassinated. Knowing Milk's story beforehand didn't make the archival candlelight march at the end any less overwhelming. It was the effect of one man's resolution too late in his life for him to have ever expected. Milk adopts emboldened importance after the victory of the appalling Proposition 8 as an electrifying honor of a key gay figure who would be raising hell right now.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Well balanced film with flaws,"This film is a rather well balanced biopic. It balances the personal and the general, the factual and the emotional, and the partial and impartial. We get a good impression of Harvey Milk as both a person and an activist. The other characters and story elements are also well portrayed. However, the narrative flow becomes muddled after the halfway mark and I felt disengaged.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Milk: Another Van Sant great film,"Milk tells the real story of Harvey Milk, the first openly gay man to be voted into public office in America. It is an inspirational drama, directed by Gus Van Sant, that reflects the intolerance and the lack of respect to gay people on the 70's decade. It is a film full of drama with some moments of maybe involuntary humor. The locations in San Francisco and the real footage makes the movie more realistic along with the very good costume design. The cast is wonderful, Sean Penn in the leading role as Harvey Milk delivers a flawless and powerful performance, he totally earned that Oscar. Josh Brolin as supervisor Dan White is excellent, no wonder why he got an Oscar nomination for supporting role. The rest of the cast like James Franco, Emile Hirsch and Diego Luna were good and convincing. In conclusion, Milk is a fully recommendable movie the teaches us to tolerate and accept people just the way they are.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Amazing performance by Sean Penn,"One of the most remarkable things about Milk is how little controversy has surrounded it. Just three years ago, the release of Brokeback Mountain was met with boycotts from anti-gay activists and sparked picketing of theaters carrying the picture. By comparison, Milk has courted minimal outrage. This may change over the course of the next few weeks as it expands to a national release, and surely Fred Phelps will have more than a few kind words for it, but it's still rather remarkable that the film has managed to produce such little fervor from the public. Even a visit to its IMDb message board reveals far less heated discussions than were present for Brokeback.Is it because it's a biographical film, rather than mere fiction? Probably not, since biographical films have been boycotted in the past, too. I tend to be optimistic on this topic, and like to think that the general public is becoming more comfortable with films like Milk. After all, in the Obama age, hasn't it become positive for us to be more open-minded and tolerant of others? The current generation spent its formative years in the Bush era, watching the Daily Show become more reliable than most reputable news sources. I don't mean to sound like Keith Olbermann, but American culture has changed rather distinctly within the past decade, and it's refreshing to see a great film judged on its artistic merits, of which it has many.Harvey Milk was the first openly gay politician in American history, elected to office in San Francisco in 1977. He was assassinated by Dan White, a resigned city supervisor, in 1978. These are the textbook facts, but the movie sheds some light on Milk's personal life, painting a fair portrait of a complex man  from his relationship with a younger male, Scott Smith (James Franco), to his journey into politics, to his untimely demise.Sean Penn's performance as Milk is almost certain to earn him an Oscar nomination. He seemingly channels the spirit of Milk, completely disappearing into character. It's a great performance, but not surprisingly so  Penn has become consistent enough that even in his lesser films he manages to create brilliant work, so it's no shocker to witness what he does with Milk. It's a testament to his strengths as an actor that you find yourself acknowledging Harvey Milk not as a mere character, or as a Sean Penn impression, but as a real person; you don't, at any time, actually feel like you're watching an actor on screen. The only other lead acting performance that may come close to this one in the year-end Oscar race is Mickey Rourke's turn in The Wrestler, with both performances focusing on what are essentially tormented and misunderstood souls.The supporting cast is up to par, too. Franco, as Milk's true love, is given slightly less to do with a character who vanishes for most of the film's middle portion, but with his work here and a great comedic performance in this year's Pineapple Express, Franco is fast establishing himself as a true talent. Emile Hirsch, as real-life activist and campaign worker Cleve Jones, turns in a humorous but affecting performance that probably won't win him any supporting standalone recognition from Penn, but helps reinforce Hirsch's direction towards becoming one of the best actors of his generation. It must also be said that Josh Brolin handles the thankless task of portraying the relative ""villain"" of the film, Dan White, with all the despair of a tragic hero. We feel that White's early intentions are earnest and goodwilled  he even invites Milk to his child's baptism  but as the events progress, Milk becomes distanced from White's policies, and White falls from glory, resigning from his position after what he perceives to be a public embarrassment at the hands of Milk, and then  after pleading to have his job back  is met with dismissal. White doesn't seem ""evil"" or even all that unlikeable  just unstable, with repressed feelings (in more ways than one, as the film implies) and a fairly dark side. We don't hate him, by the end of the film, because he is given a remarkable amount of depth despite Brolin's limited screen time.One could view this film as a passion project for director Gus Van Sant, who had subsided into independent films for a few years after the mainstream successes of Good Will Hunting and Finding Forrester, but perhaps found identification with the themes of Milk. The movie arrives at an opportune time, with its focus on the Prop 6 controversy in the 1970s immediately finding relevance with the current Prop 8 vote. Some of the vintage news footage shown in the movie, featuring interviews with anti-gay activists of the time like Anita Bryant, seem amusingly dated  until you realize how they, too, are uncomfortably relevant in our day and age.Ultimately, the movie tells us that Harvey Milk wanted to bring about change, and shows us how he made quite an impact during his short-lived political career. The film serves him justice, and  thanks to a faultless cast and a great director  is one of the best of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A powerful and engaging film,"This film is about the activist Harvey Milk, who stirred up a gay rights movement in the conservative America back in 1970's.""Milk"" is an engaging film about Harvey Milk. The characters are all very well portrayed, especially Harvey Milk and Scott Smith. They are real human beings that connect to the viewers. Every time a character does something, I look forward to seeing them succeed. This does not happen very much for me, which shows how well the characters are sculpted and how engaging they are.Sean Penn's acting is amazing. The ease he displayed when he kisses several other actors is also remarkable. Scott Smith has a special mysterious charm, that I somehow long for him to be back with Harvey Milk.Despite the ending is already shown right at the beginning of the film, it strangely does not spoil the film, but in fact enhances interest in the film. It makes me want to find out why such an ending occurs. As for the real ending, it is powerful and tear jerking.""Milk"" is a well made film that engages viewers throughout.",,Anonymous,Biography
Great acting but not a great film.,"Up until a few months ago i had never heard of the Name Harvey Milk. There is no reason why i should have done really and it's only the release of this film that had brought his name to my attention. To be honest a movie with this subject matter would not be first on my list but being a big fan of Sean Penn and Josh Brolin and it being nominated for eight Oscars i had to see what all the fuss was about.From the acclaimed director Gus Van Sant comes the powerful and inspiring story of California's first openly gay elected official, Harvey Milk. With a powerhouse performance in the leading role, Sean Penn and supporting cast Emile Hirsch , Josh Brolin and James Franco bring this unforgettable story to the big screen.In 1977, Harvey Milk was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, becoming the first openly gay man to be voted into major public office in America. His victory was not just a victory for gay rights; he forged coalitions across the political spectrum. From senior citizens to union workers, Harvey Milk changed the very nature of what it means to be a fighter for human rights and became, before his untimely death in 1978..Apparently there were many actors lined up over the years to play the role of Harvey Milk. Robin Williams , Richard Gere , Daniel Day-Lewis and James Woods. I can see Daniel Day-Lewis in the role but can you imagine any of the others? Sean Penn IS Harvey Milk and without him in the lead role i couldn't imagine this film even getting even a mention in the build up to next months academy awards.It would have been easy to cast openly gay actors in the lead roles in this film and i think it's because director Gus Van Sant didn't , that gives this film more gravitas. I did feel a little uncomfortable watching some of the more intimate scenes involving Sean Penn and James Franco so i can only imagine how hard it was for these two actors to perform the scenes.Of all the nominations Milk has received it's the acting ones that it deserves most. Sean Penn is stunning and it's the acting in this film will remain with me , not the film itself.As a film , Milk is OK . It's not as good as i would have hoped considering the publicity it has received. I would have loved to have learned more about Dan White. Josh Brolin is not on screen enough for me but when he is , he was fantastic. I would have like the director to have delved into the mind of Harvey Milk's assassin and maybe the assassination itself given some more scenes.I loved the old newsreel clips that were shown and it's amazing how the word "" Homosexuals"" can be made to sound so dirty and poisonous by the prehistoric news readers!I have seen two of the films nominated for best picture so far and without doubt Slumdog Millionaire is the better film but the acting in Milk is vastly superior .I will be reviewing the other nominated film's in the next couple of weeks.7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Milk was an educational and entertaining look at the slain San Francisco Supervisor,"My friend (who is gay) and I came into this movie knowing not too much about Harvey Milk other than his assassination and his activist stance and came out learning much more about his lifestyle and the reasons why he did what he did. Director Gus Van Sant and actor Sean Penn bring this movie about the San Francisco Supervisor to life with humor and much admiration of how he kept going with his beliefs despite some death threats and a couple of troubled relationships (as depicted with James Franco and Diego Luna). Also compelling were documentary footage of singer Anita Bryant and her constant fight against what she implied were threats against the children of the world among others. It was also refreshing to hear that even Ronald Reagan was with Jerry Brown and Jimmy Carter against Proposition 6. So all I need to say is if you want to see something both dramatically compelling and educational too, I highly recommend Milk.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Got milk, anyone?","Milk tells the tale of supervisor Harvey Milk, a political man who flaunts his sexuality to oppose modern beliefs, and gain his his First Amendment right as he runs for mayor of San Fransisco.Personally I believe that the directing was excellent, and Gus Van Sant truly kept even the straightest of people rooting for Harvey Milk by making his movie so entertaining. Acting was worth a remark as well. Great performances by Penn, Franco, and Hirsch (quite the transformation from into the wild if u ask me). I also learned a thing or two about how gays were treated during the 1970s due to religious and social turmoil.Having said that, I also believe that the ""gay"" part of the movie was what completely ruined it. The producers could have done the same exact story with any other minority. A black candidate in an anti-black community, a Muslim candidate in an anti Muslim community, and the list could go on an on. What most people see in a heartwarming, entertaining flick, I see desperation in trying to get the ever-growing gay community to side with this movie. And I'm afraid that might influence certain big-name awards such as the Oscars. Why destroy social and religious values? Simply because the movie was directly aimed at the gay community.Critics are hailing this movie as a ""true American epic"". A true American epic? Do they know what that says about America? To me, it is absolute nonsense, and despite the entertaining theatrical factors the movie possesses, I highly dislike the idea of promoting this certain anti-religion minority in such a way.I also believe that one should learn about history no matter what ethics or rules it opposes. What happened has happened, therefore we might as well learn about it as we cant really change it. And I'm perfectly pleased to learn a history lesson about homosexuals and their troubles during the 70s. Just not while watching Sean Penn and James Franco make out.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

I would strongly recommend people see this movie because its rare a movie this good, with a story that strong comes along.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
You should drink this Milk,"Make no mistake: With Milk, the new biopic by director Gus Van Sant and starring Sean Penn in the lead role as Harvey Milk, the first openly gay man elected to public office, Penn has proved once again what a masterful actor he is. Milk is a strong film for the most part, but Penn puts it over the top with his turn as the insurance executive turned political activist. There are many things to recommend Milk, but Penn is at the center of them all.Opening in 1970, Milk introduces us to Harvey as he meets Scott Smith (James Franco) in New York. The two become lovers and elect to move to San Francisco and become hippies while embracing the growing openly gay culture that is alive in the city. After opening a photo shop in the Castro area and seeing the prejudice that homosexuals face, Milk becomes a political activist and runs for city supervisor. After losing the race multiple times, Milk manages to pull a coup when the city's districts are remade and finds himself elected to office.At the same time as Harvey is assuming his new responsibilities, there is a significant anti-gay fervor that seems to be sweeping the country, led by religious activist Anita Bryant, championing legislature in several counties and cities in the US that strips gays of their civil rights. To combat these efforts, Harvey continues to assemble his followers into a powerful political force. However, closer to home, Harvey is challenged by a fellow city supervisor, Dan White (Josh Brolin), who is struggling with personal demons that will prove to be tragic.Milk is a relatively straightforward biographical film, not really deviating from what we would expect for this kind of picture. That, however, does not detract from it's overall success. Milk is an affecting film, dealing with the issues of discrimination and intolerance and showing that sometimes, one man can make a difference. Of course, the centerpiece is Penn as Milk. During the film's end credits, Van Sant shows a clip of Penn as Milk that dissolves to the real Milk, and the mannerisms blend seamlessly. Penn fully embodies the character, creating a man who was serious about his activism, but yet approached most everything with a somewhat lighthearted touch. You believe in Penn as Milk completely, and it is difficult to imagine that Penn won't receive yet another nod from the Academy for his performance early next year.Van Sant also touches on issues of political power, showing how individuals can be organized to push a movement, against all odds, but he doesn't shy away from the sometimes less pleasant aspects of politics, hinting at the corruption of power and the willingness of politicians to bend their word to get what they want. The film also deals with what Harvey gives up in his personal life to gain his political goals, seeing more than one lover leave because of their inability to take second place in Harvey's life to the movement he devotes himself to. In some ways, Milk is a tragic story.As the troubled Dan White, Josh Brolin delivers an understated performance of a man trapped by times and things he can't completely understand, and the film also suggests that he may have been homosexual himself and has buried that aspect of himself under a ""cloak"" of normalcy. In many of the scenes between Harvey and White there is almost an air of sexual tension that gives greater credence to the actions of White later in the picture. Emile Hirsch gives a strong performance as Cleave Jones, who starts out as a man just looking for a good time to someone who begins to believe in the cause as much as Harvey. Franco is also good as long suffering lover Scott, who is unable to cope with Harvey's focus on the movement and the toll it takes on their relationship. Diego Luna is amusing at times as Jack, someone Harvey takes in, but the part proves a bit underwritten.Milk delivers an affecting and involving story of the fight against injustice and the man who was it's spark, which is all the strong due to Penn's outstanding performance. After two hours in the theater, you will believe you have met and spent time with Harvey Milk.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
equal in strength and virtue to The Times Of Harvey Milk,"The feature film which has empowered me most to be happy as a gay man and equal rights activist was the Robert Epstein documentary ""The Times Of Harvey Milk"". Having just recently enjoyed the Australian release of the fully restored 25th anniversary DVD I was well placed to compare that carefully crafted documentary to Gus Van Sant's equally skillfully crafted biopic ""Milk"". There's no doubt in my mind that they're both equally capable of changing the world for the better by opening hearts and minds, and stirring people out of their complacency to help fix all the anti-gay oppression which still festers across the globe in almost every nation - including the USA and Australia.Sean Penn turns in a Best Actor Academy Award performance - he lives and breathes, moves and grooves, loves and erupts as Harvey Milk. All the supporting cast are up the task too. I am especially impressed by the way that Gus Van Sant hasn't flinched at giving us a view of Harvey Milk's life through a decidedly queer lens. The audience isn't being pandered to, no matter what their personal sexuality. We're given time portal access to real life in Harvey's experience of those angst wrought years of the seventies. We're reminded that life is short and every single day counts vitally as an opportunity to achieve maximum good in the world.I was really quite disappointed to see James Franco on Letterman (late November '08) say that he had voted with firm conviction against Proposition 8 in the November 2008 ballot, but he wasn't sure whether he would have opposed 1978's ""Proposition 6"" (which would have banned gays and lesbians, and possibly anyone who supported gay rights, from working in California's public schools.) When Franco can play the part of such an informed gay activist and still miss the point of the issue so widely, it shows that there is an enormous proportion of the general public who need to see this fine feature film, to understand its message and then put into practice the knowledge that there is absolutely no substitute for equality.I would hope that ""Milk"" will have the same level of beneficial impact for all viewers, not just us queers (or whatever descriptive you happen to choose).",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Let your heart shine!,"""Milk"" (1980) not only stands as a tribute to Harvey Milk and the Stonewall Rebellion, but for every person that has grieved and fought for gay civil rights. The gay movement has made a great deal of progress, but there is a long way to go. Yet, there is hope. Who would have thought, for example, that conservative New England would ever show compassion for gay people--and, yet, I say with great pride that my home state of Connecticut now grants gay marriage. Although gay people are where African Americans were, prior to when they got civil rights, African Americans serve as our role models in our fight for equality and fairness.It is becoming apparent that the majority of gay people are united in faith, religion, and spirituality. Gay marriage is showing that we take commitment seriously, too. And, it is a blessing to see traditional vows being used in gay ceremonies. What are fight is all about, I think, is getting a piece of the piece. It is not about a takeover, or changing the world--but, rather, giving us a legitimate place in a society that is equally precious.It is re-assuring to see Sean Penn so believably, and with compassion. He shines as Harvey Milk, and the radiance comes from his sincerity. It is very obvious that his heart is in the right place, and being a person with such humility, he captures the hearts and minds of many. It is also very gratifying to see so many people, outside of the gay community, supporting us in our fight for civil rights. It is very comforting to see a significant number of the same people standing beside us. Our fight is not about, and should not be all about religion. It is about accepting diversity, and about love. This whole thing is about getting to better understand each other, and to cheer each other on. It's not about turning the entire world gay--and, in fact, gay people only make up a minority of the population.I am a tiny ant living in a huge colony of ants--but, as a gay person, I have an enormous degree of pride in our inherent goodness, and the good that we are able to do. But, it is good to see people like Sean Penn, Kevin Costner, Elizabeth Taylor, Judy Garland, Paul Newman, Brad Pitt, and Heath Ledger further empower us. For such things, and more, I am greatly thankful.Gus Van Sant's direction is flawless, and the performances by member of the cast is impeccable. The film is inspirational--and, hopefully, it will recruit others in our quest for civil rights and understanding. I rank this film a 10 out of 10. Please go see the movie. See it with a gracious heart and an open mind.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Doesn't quite get into the man but does a great job or representing his importance and impact within a movement,"I finally got round to seeing Milk after the Oscars gave it a bit of a publicity boost by virtue of Penn and the writer winning awards. It was not that I hadn't wanted to see the film (I had) but just that the cinemas had suddenly been overwhelmed with ""award-worthy"" films all trying to get publicity and eligibility at the same time. The film itself is best approached outside of all the hype and praise though, because it is not this perfect film that some would have you believe (although this is not to say that it is bad, just that all these films get talked-up far too much at this time of year).Milk covers a lot of ground and it is to its credit that it does it in a way that has a good narrative flow to it and mixes the professional and personal Milk into the tale. Where I think the film works best though is in the way it manages to capture a movement and a time. Having been to the Castro a few years ago, it is hard to imagine the world as it was at the start of the film and yet this is made real and convincing thanks to the use of news footage and also an air or atmosphere or intolerance that is much more effective than having ""big"" moments (although it has those as well). Out of this, Milk's achievements and part of overall progress of the movement is clear and engaging. The slight downside of this is that the man himself is a little lost in the midst of this.OK we do get some personal stuff in there but it is very much by-the-by and not as interesting as the bigger picture. Don't get me wrong though, this is not a major problem because I felt the mix was appropriate for what the film was doing and I did like the balance it struck  just I can see why some of those familiar with Milk (I wasn't) may feel like he as a person isn't that well done. This aspect is helped though by Penn being good in the title role. He brings determination and vision to the character and, at the risk of being overly blunt, he ""does"" a gay character without turning it into a caricature. Personally I don't think he was anywhere near as good as Rourke but the issues within this film had particular political importance in California in the year before these awards and this will have played in the film's favour Oscar-wise.Van Sant's direction is very good. There are clever shots and movements but never to the point that feel done for the sake of it or that they distract. His direction is well folded in with news footage from the time and it is to the credit of the costume and set departments that the film feels very of its time  even when set alongside this actual footage. The supporting cast also includes some very good turns. It is not Brolin's film and his material is too limited to allow him to really impress but he does go very well with his character. Likewise Franco, who is much better than I expected him to be. These are the standouts but generally the cast are convincing, with only one or two weaker turns that I felt did get close to caricature or cliché.Milk is not a perfect film and I can understand why those really familiar with the subject would have issues with the grand sweep of it and the lack of detail and perhaps development of Milk as a person. However it still works very well and accesses the importance of the man and the movement while also accurately capturing the sense of time and place. Perhaps not as emotionally impacting as a result, the film still does make a very good job of taking an important part of modern history and making it into a flowing and accessible piece of drama.",,Anonymous,Biography
Not what I expected !,"I personally think this movie could've been way better than what came out. it's way too general and I believe the screenplay could've been written with more details , like how Milk got that close to that young gay boy who helped him a lot and also some other people around him. the director could spice it up with more love scenes and more focus on Harvey Milk's personal life and relationships. Sean Penn gave a memorable performance as Harvey Milk. one of the best things about this Oscar movie was the casting , I highly doubt that the casting could be better than this , everybody were for the right role specially Mr.Penn as the man of courage Harvey Milk. in the end I would like to say it again that it was not what I expected by still a good movie to watch ,you will be amused by Penn's performance.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Powerful and phenomenal film, with amazing performances","It was a perfect, successful, biographical film about one man and his hopes and accomplishments. Seriously, what a great film. It achieves everything that it should have done, and does it with such great power. The editing of scenes, the writing, the fast pacing, the characters, and all of the amazing performances in the film. Sean Penn gives such a realistic portrayal of Harvey Milk, I will safely bet that he will win the best Actor Oscar. Emile Hirsch, in a second year in a row, is also great, as well as Franco, Brolin, and Luna. They all played their characters very realistically. The film shows all the issues that gays had back then, and it shows us how to live with equal rights, not just for gays, but for everyone different.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Lukewarm,"The life of Harvey Milk, which through his own admission was nothing special at forty certainly contains all the elements for absorbing cinema. A charismatic late blooming civil rights activist, he mobilized a marginalized segment of society into a political power with a relentless determination that went from a series of political defeats to victory and eventually martyrdom. Milk's mercurial rise and fall is an absorbing story but perhaps too brief to justify it's over two hour running time.Director Gus Van Zandt opens Milk by economically summing up his adult years and what he faced as a gay man in New York with documentary photos and footage of the famed Stonewall incident in the early 60's. With this as a backdrop we are introduced to the priapic Milk (Sean Penn) cruising a guy on a subway platform. Becoming lovers they decide to escape the oppressive east coast scene and go Greeley. Moving to San Francisco they open a camera store. Milk once again experiences bigotry but this time he decides like those at the Stonewall to take a stand. Successfully employing the same boycott tactics that Civil Rights groups did in the segregationist South in the fifties he finds his voice and becomes a leading activist in SFs gay community. Running for office he is defeated twice but perseveres and is eventually elected a city manager where he locks horns with conservative ex-cop Dan White, his and the city mayor's ultimate assassin. Milk's greatest battle though is with American as apple pie orange juice pitch person and homophobe poster child Anita Bryant who is zealously attempting to blacklist gay school teachers throughout the country.Through Milk's character Van Zandt carefully and clearly conveys the struggle for equality an end to the blatant discrimination homosexuals faced in the seventies. It is an historically significant story but Milk's private life is mostly soap opera and it breaks the torrid pace of the events taking place on the world stage. Van Zandt tries to elevate it with operatic crutches (literally employing Tosca) but it becomes mired in self indulgence and repetitious scenes of Harvey half lit speaking into a tape recorder and this deadens the rhythm of the film.Sean Penn is incredibly moving as Milk. Avoiding the over the top scenery chewing he served up in the recent All the King's Men remake, he gives us a man of commitment whose greatest strength was not to take himself so seriously. Penn deftly sidesteps queening it up (going Capote) with wonderfully controlled nuance and inflection bringing a great degree of dignity to the character.Beyond Penn's performance, the rest of the cast offers little more than reactions and Van Zandt fails to explore in much depth the crucial character of Dan White, up tightly overplayed by Josh Brolin. The film's only other intriguing character is to be found in the documentary footage of Miss Anita Bryant spewing her blind hatred in a most ladylike fashion and it is a chilling performance to witness.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Stellar biographical film of a great man.,"Harvey Milk was a hero, for both the gay and civil rights movements. As an African American lesbian, I thought that Harvey Milk's progressive political stance, was particularly relevant to those like me. He was willing to put everything on the line, to fight for all oppressed people. It seemed to me that when Milk was fighting for justice in the 70s and 80s, politicians were way more committed to their constituents, than they are today. This was certainly the case, with the political activism of Harvey Milk.Harvey Milk let nothing stand in his way, in his pursuit of his ideals. We desperately need more politicians like him, in our very troubled era. Rights for minorities, gay and lesbians, women, working people, etc., have been under attack by the right-wing political machine, in recent years. The time is right, for another progressive leader, to take a serious stand on civil rights for all, like Harvey Milk had the courage to do when he was alive.Sean Penn's performance as Harvey Milk, is a prime example of his superb talent as an actor. Penn shows a real finesse, for conveying Harvey Milk's mannerisms, passionate political convictions, and dedication to the cause for justice, for the underdogs in society.Josh Brolin as Dan White, turns in a muted, yet deeply resonate performance. Though not as marvelously talented as Sean Penn, Brolin has a terse, brooding charisma, that can't be ignored.Harvey Milk was a bold, brave man, who deserves to be remembered as such. This film does justice to Harvey Milk's memory, and to those that want to see the honorable man that Harvey Milk was, and what he stood for.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Real, true and convincing","If you are strongly prejudiced against gays don't go to watch this movie because it will do you no good at all. But if you are unprejudiced or think you can overcome your prejudice you'll find this movie a good one. It was based on real events that took place in San Francisco's public and political life in the seventies of last century when an assumed gay after a few previous defeats, ran successfully for the post of municipal supervisor in the city, protesting to defend not only gays but all the other discriminated minorities rights. The whole story is well balanced in the sense that we are confronted with all the usual arguments for and against gays rights but showing anyway gays as normal human beings and not freaks. Sean Penn does a remarkable role as the protagonist and his acting is really strong and convincing. The only weak part of the movie seems to me to be the character of Dan White (done by Josh Brolin) another municipal supervisor which is not very well and clearly characterized particularly in what concerns his tragic actions in the end of the movie whose motives don't appear as strong enough to explain such tragic deeds. Nevertheless this is a good,true and well told story (both in images and dialogues), well acted and well directed in terms of form and content.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Decent Film at Best,"Sean Penn dominates the film, because there's really nothing else of note to mention. He gives a good performance, as does Jimmy Franco as his gay lover. But the story is thin, and doesn't move me emotionally the way its supposed to. And the fact that the gay characters are all played by young modern day sex symbols doesn't help the believability of the characters. Emile Hirsch, Diego Luna, James Franco, and Sean Penn? As the fluffiest homosexuals alive? I don't think so.The script isn't that great, and it just didn't have the same impact on me, that others are saying it had on them. The summary says it all... its a decent film at best.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Relevant - still,"Milk is emotionally arousing, highly spirited movie about a minor politician at the forefront of a civil rights movement in the late 70s. Civil rights movies are always inspiring as the movement itself is, and this movement has to this day not come to fruition. His battle to get into office and then his battle once in office for civil rights for homosexuals will reach the depth of your heart and get you rooting for these rights. .Penn and Hirsh's performances were the highlight. It was amusing to witness how these actors so believably capture the subtle effeminate disposition (Penn was great and Hirsh is always good but here, surprisingly unbelievable). Unfortunately, despite the way Penn truly envelops the character Harvey Milk, WE, do not become that enveloped with Milk. The character Milk still feels as though he is just on the surface. We see his determinism towards his movement and his minor quirks but we don't really know him, his hobbies, his outside interests, but most of all we don't connect with his innermost feelings nor do we permeate his soul. For this reason I would not recommend to drop everything and see it right away. The greatest movies about a character, which are primarily about the character, explore the insides of his/her personality and completely expose their beings to us. Perhaps it was the intent to make the politics and the movement the theme which happens to still be so intensely relevant in our time.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A must see movie with so many touching scenes,"I cried so hard through this movie. People around me cried hard as well. A friend of mine had seen the movie three times and every time he cried. I went to the Castro area before. Everything seemed familiar yet far away. The struggling inside is heartfelt. And I have to say that we got a long way to go. One day, when I look back on this movie, I hope that I will smile instead of crying. Growing up as gay is a process that I never felt happy with until recently. This movie struck me hard when the characters display the undying hope for a better future and the consistent fight they had against the power of many other people. History seems to copying its own route and there will be a day when brightness comes upon us all.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Powerful film, but the director does a disservice to the movement","Up front, let me say that this is a good movie with excellent acting, a powerful message, and overall it's a credit to the art of filmmaking. Other reviewers have covered that better than I can; I just want to mention something that no one else seems to have brought up.Director Gus Van Sant chose to focus on the personal life of the man Harvey Milk rather than the cause he championed. This wouldn't be a problem except that Van Sant gives us a highly airbrushed, family-friendly, almost Disney version of Harvey Milk, making me wonder: if this film isn't about the gay rights movement, and if it isn't about the real Harvey Milk, then what is it about?If you dare to hear me out for 2 paragraphs, you might want to don your iconoclast flak jacket because I may shatter the lily white image of Milk that the director would have you believe. But I'm doing this to make a point that a good film would celebrate the ideals of an individual rather than the individual (or a fabcation of a perfect saint for us to idolize). But such is Hollywood, I guess.The man real man Harvey Milk wasn't always the boyscout which director Gus Van Sant paints him to be. In reality, it may have been more accurate to say that Harvey was *interested in dating* boyscouts (boo hiss, I couldn't resist 1 tasteless joke, but the truth remains: at least one of Harvey's lovers, Jack McKinley, was 16 years old when Harvey, 33, ran away with him in 1963). Another sore spot, which the film exploits for a cheap emotional twist, is the suicide of a certain minor character. If you want to know the truth behind this subplot, google ""Harvey Milk and the Boy from Minnesota"" for an eye opening exposé which might make you wish they had omitted the whole episode from the film, rather than twist it into a tear jerker.I understand that Harvey Milk is synonymous with gay rights in the 1970s, and certainly he deserves much praise for his amazing accomplishments. I just resent the way Gus Van Sant fabricated a glossy, flawless hero. I would've much preferred a fallible hero who does the right thing, much like the excellent film ""Amadeus"" accurately portrays Mozart as a stumbling drunk but a musical genius nonetheless. Give the audience credit for differentiating the human from the achievement.Apologies if I ruined the illusion of Harvey Milk's perfect life, but isn't it better to honor the things he did? If anything, that's the legacy Harvey Milk wanted: for us to carry on the message rather than idolizing the messenger.",,Anonymous,Biography
San Francisco Story....,"....that will resonate with the world. Sean Penn channels Harvey Milk beautifully and charismatically starting from 1970 all the way through 1978. Early black-and-white (actual) scenes of police carting out gay bar patrons to jail set the tone for director Gus Van Sant's best work. It's the seamless branching of archival 1970s footage with new photography that truly takes you back over 30 years to a different time and place, lovingly realized here. We see a brief early shot of Dianne Feinstein announce shocking news, as well as Anita Bryant's continued pitch to take away gay rights. Can't add much to the other reviewers comments on the superb supporting cast, but I was really taken by Diego Luna as one of Milk's last lovers, Jack Lira. Of Mexican heritage, he was beaten by his father, and Luna transcends with a mighty characterization of insecurities, heartbreak and devastation. Last part of the film becomes increasingly nerve-wracking and ultimately extremely moving, even to the end credits with the cast/real counterpart images and captions, set to an evocative musical score. A thought-provoking piece that will haunt you for many days.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A gorgeous conventional biopic paying homage to the movement and the man,"Surely, Gus Van Sant was aware that Harvey Milk's life and the gay rights struggle were not his to play around with, cinematically. They are public property, and Van Sant handles them as such.As a result, he has made a straightforward (as straight as a movie about Milk could be) and easy-to-follow movie that is sure to please any audience who doesn't hate the gays. No sudden twists or turns, no lingering shots (although ""Gerry"" is still tied with ""Drugstore Cowboy"" for my favorite Van Sant film) -- just an action-packed life story. I found myself repeatedly wondering how the director was able to stuff so much into one film.The atmosphere of 1970s S.F. is amazing; I'm too young but felt like I remembered it anyway. Many scenes look like shots from my parents' rolls of film when I was a child.But the star of this movie is Sean Penn. He is in nearly every scene, nearly every minute, and so he has to inhabit Milk, not just ""portray"" him or ""mimic"" him. And he pulls it off amazingly. I was convinced he was Milk. An Oscar-worthy performance if I've ever watched one. The look in his eyes, the wrinkle of his smile, every tiny thing feels genuine and human.I only have one complaint with the film: the formal structure of having Milk reading his story into a tape recorder. I guess it made it easier to jump around in time and to put the story together the way Van Sant wanted or needed to, but it felt clunky and unnecessary. It also led to Milk reading the lines of his famous speech instead of giving them to a crowd, which I would have preferred, but I guess I see the reason (without making it into a spoiler).As others have pointed out, the sad ugliness of this film is that it documents a struggle from 30 years ago that is still happening today, in much the same terms. It is shameful that America has moved forward so little.It is shameful that pastor Rick Warren could have told a crowd in Uganda in March 2008 that gays are unnatural and don't deserve full human rights -- and that he would still be invited to speak at Barack Obama's presidential inauguration.It is shameful that people would still wonder whether the ""all"" in ""all men are created equal"" would apply to ALL or not.It is shameful that gays are still beaten and killed in America, just for existing.Perhaps this movie will help inspire a new generation of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning and intersex people to stand up and demand human dignity. I know I'm ready.For me, the film made me cry a bunch, and it certainly accomplished what Milk demanded in his most famous speech -- ""You gotta give 'em hope.""",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
American gay people acting different than European gay people?,"I have no doubts about the acting qualities of Sean Penn. Neither do I have any doubts about the entertainment quality of this movie nor the message it sends ... it all has been answered in previous reviews/comments.However, what disturbs me is that I've never seen a gay person in my life act like the way they do in this movie. And I'm a 60's guy. Were gay cultures different between the US and Europe?! Were gay people in the US really that exaggerated female in their actions? For as far as I know gay people (and I have 4 close friends that are gay, including inside my local police force), they behave exactly as everyone else does. Only their sexual tastes differs ... and it's not exactly something you can see on the street. You have to know them, waiting for them to admit it. Else, you'll simply never know. In the 70's, politics were indeed different than now (at least in Europe), but you couldn't see it better if someone had a different taste regarding sexual behaviour than you can do now. Full stop. It makes this movie a comedy, not historical accuracy ... in my humble opinion ... unless gay people in the US were really really different than the ones in the Europe ...",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sean Penn has pulled off an absolutely perfect performance in Van Sant's powerful biopic,"Gay Rights has slowly become a thing of the past in modern society as diversity stretches to the deepest crevices of any ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation. Liberality is something that we take for granted indeed, yet society wasn't always liberal nor was it easy to gain it's liberality. People had to fightfor it, fight the government and most importantly fight for their reputation. Milk highlights the inspirational life of the first openly gay US government official, Harvey Milk and the struggle of homosexual acceptance in San Francisco and elsewhere in the USA.Harvey Milk was a simple man, claiming that he had turned 40 and hadn't done anything worthy. Yet after he and his boyfriend move to San Francisco, he suddenly becomes embroiled in a heart-felt battle to fight for Gay rights through mass protests and publicity stunts. Milk slowly gathers a huge following and eventually achieves title of the first openly gay government official.The carrier of this film is of course, Sean Penn. His performance was flawless, charming and completely magnanimous to the real persona of Harvey Milk. His mannerisms and body language have an outrageous similarity to Harvey Milk and Penn is by no means a camp man. Such in depth character study is extraordinary. Everything about Penn's performance was perfect, it wasn't overplayed and wasn't underplayed, just sheer perfection. In fact, I think Penn truly deserves the Oscar but I think Rourke's comeback performance in The Wrestler will get the Oscar, despite Rourke deserving it, I would prefer it to go to Penn.Van Sant's flamboyant direction was also wildly enjoyable, I loved his blend of real documentary footage with the non-linearity of the story telling. It was also an interesting choice for the ending of the story to be told in not only the beginning of the film but also in the promoting of the film. The producers did this because Milk's fate isn't the point of the film; the point of the film is to capture the inspiration in this story of one man overcoming a nation of prejudice, hate and discrimination.Milk illustrates the power of the gay rights movement in San Francisco whilst questioning our collective views of gays as victimised humans that are humans nonetheless.Milk is emotionally raw, visually magnificent and awesomely performed, 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

There are many times when all of my friends and I have big debates on what is the best movie about real people. Some say it is JFK or W, or some say it is Malcom X or the Doors (that is one is me. I say it is the Doors). Now some people can say it is this movie if they truly feel that way!

"A wonderful, moving, important film: go see it!","I had high expectations of Milk, being a fan both of Gus Van Sant and Sean Penn, but this film totally surpassed anything I was expecting.It is beautiful, engaging, moving, stirring, powerful and, of course, ultimately desperately sad in terms of the assassinations of both San Francisco City Supervisor Harvey Milk and San Francisco Mayor George Moscone (no plot spoiler here, since their deaths are announced in newsreel footage within the first few minutes of the movie), but at the same time its portrait of a man of true courage and of the activism he stirred transcends the tragedy.Penn gives an astonishing performance as Milk, one that I hope earns him this year's Best Actor Oscar, because he captures the humanity, joy and rightful anger of the man without once slipping into any kind of gay stereotype. When you see Milk/Penn's tearful response to the fate of the Anti-Gay Proposition 6 (the ""Briggs Initiative"", widely promoted by the deeply disturbing so-called Christian singer, Anita Bryant), you witness a moment that feels acutely judged, in terms of Milk's emotions, sexuality and personality. And Penn, who has his own fine record as an activist, brings real passion to Milk's powerful, original and courageous approach to ""gay rights.""Josh Brolin, like the entire cast, is outstanding in his role as City Supervisor Dan White, to whom Milk shows great sympathy early on - attending the christening of White's child when all the other supervisors fail to turn up.Gus Van Sant's direction is a perfectly judged blend of drama, humor and finely-paced use of newsreel, which, along with Danny Elfman's excellent score, draws echoes at times of the Holocaust, given the black and white images of gay men crammed into old police wagons. (I do not mean to diminish the Holocaust, but the echoes seem deliberate, given the Nazis' own persecution of homosexuals.)While I believe that Elephant remains Van Sant's most remarkable movie in terms of its use of time, its beautiful long tracking shots and silences, and above all its surprising and very underplayed approach to another horrific subject (the Columbine shootings), Milk is a more accessible movie and I hope it finds a wide, wide audience and does great box office, not simply to benefit the movie but to inform the public.This is a film about fundamental human rights, not gay rights, and it should be seen in particular by all those who continue to campaign, often in the misused name of their religion, against gays and lesbians. The recent passage of Prop. 8 in California, on the same day that President-Elect Obama was swept into office, was a sad irony, and I only pray that ultimately - and soon - everyone will embrace the notion that all people deserve the same rights, that all people experience the same love (if they are lucky) and that in a world where love sometimes seems in short supply, we should celebrate it, not limit it.Milk is an important film, one of the few this year that is actually about something. I strongly urge everyone to see it.",,Anonymous,Biography

"Good film, outstanding Penn","Not being American and not being gay I had no idea what this film was about. I had not read any reviews of it and I went to see it because I am an unconditional fan of Sean Penn as an actor (not so much as a director). And I have to say that my intuition was correct - this is another superb performance from the man. From a physical standpoint, his depiction of Harvey Milk is uncontrived and extremely well observed. From the standpoint of character, merit must be shared with Director van Sant and the screen writing team but he certainly emerges as a plausible, life-like person with qualities such as generosity, love, caring for his neighbour (especially if gay), and a positive ambition for politics, along with the flaws of backstabbing and selfishness that any politician must have to survive. Most interesting of all, though, is the conflict that pits Penn and Josh Brolin in the role of fellow San Francisco Mayor's Office supervisor Dan White. They could not be more different: Milk is gay - a status largely unaccepted and even derided at the time - while White is heterosexual, married, and with children to boost his image as a more conventional politician. Yet, as the film wears on one realizes how much more unbalanced, vindictive, politically incorrect and ultimately murderous White is and how the unacceptably gay Milk is the type of person society really needs to grow because of his ability to listen, care, get involved, and share thoughts. Brolin and Franco ably support Penn with outstanding performances. Director van Sant reconstructs the San Francisco of the 1970's with great conviction and attention to detail (his depiction of the crowds in hippie and liberal attire is astonishing). Historic events surface unobtrusively, keeping the film chronologically situated and credible, in addition to providing much needed information that never interferes with the development of the central character and the action around him. In addition to excellent and never pervasive camera work, Van Sant uses the flashback technique in a far subtler way than I have seen in any film I can remember. Having watched the competition for the Academy Awards (apart from The Reader) I would confidently vote for Penn as best actor, van Sant as best director, and Milk as best picture.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

A dramatic depiction of the political career and assassination of Harvey Milk,"I actually lived in the ""Castro"" (aka Eureka Valley) during the time Harvey Milk was a Supervisor and I can tell you that, as an 11 year old living through them, the events of November 27, 1978 were terrifying-all the more so since they came not even 2 weeks after the Jonestown massacre and the assassination of Congressman Leo Ryan. Gus Van Sant does a very good job overall in depicting with a minimum of gratuitous melodrama some already dramatic events. As for Sean Penn, he does his usual stellar job. He knew better than to just mimic Harvey (Penn is both shorter and more introspective than the real Harvey was, anyway). Instead, he gives the viewer a touching and very personal interpretation of Harvey's character/mannerisms etc. He shows us Harvey's vulnerability and his humanity without resorting to cheap mimicry. And, Josh Brolin!!!! He was robbed of the Oscar here. He does an absolutely fabulous job in giving the viewer a sensitive interpretation of Dan White's character. When you see Brolin marching around City Hall, you can truly see that this man, Dan White, was truly deeply troubled and highly pressurized inside himself. Brolin invokes pity when he could have just played White as the Twinkie eating psycho he is in popular mythology. In the end, ""Milk"" is a great film because it avoids the stereotypes it could have invoked (and gotten away with).",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Amazing true story...,"""Milk"" is a Biography - Drama movie in which we follow the life of Harvey Milk, the first openly gay elected official in California, and his relentless fight for LGBTQ+ rights in the 1970s.I liked this movie because it was based on true events and I was fascinated by Harvey Milk, a simply remarkable individual who dedicated his life to creating change despite facing overwhelming opposition. The interpretation of Sean Penn who played as Harvey Milk was simply amazing and was both charismatic and grounded, showing the complexities of a man who was both a visionary and deeply human. The movie didn't just focus on Milk's political career but also highlighted his personal struggles and the emotional toll of his activism. The direction which was made by Gus Van Sant was very good and he captured very well the atmosphere of the era while keeping the focus firmly on the themes of love, equality, and resilience.

The Many Questions of Milk,"Look, the story is sound, Sean Penn is fantastic, Emile Hirsch, the writing, the pacing, Danny Elfman, Gus Van Sant... but my guess is that you already know all that if you're looking at this. Rather than extol the technical merits of Milk, let me talk about my Dad.My Dad winced a lot while watching Milk. He's 60, smart guy, been a fire-breathing California Liberal his whole life and he winced every time a man kissed another during Milk.So he did a lot of wincing.Walking out, we were talking about the unending bigotry surrounding gay rights and he said that although he's for complete equality and was overwhelmed by the humanity of particularly Sean Penn's performance, he finds it hard to watch a man kissing another with sexual intent. I responded ""Well yeah, Brokeback was tough to watch. That was really about the act of gay sex, this was different. Milk is about gay life, culture, the sex was secondary."" He smiled and said ""But you were born after Milk had been murdered. Your generation views sexuality in a fundamentally different way then previous generations."" ""Anyways, what do you give it?"" ""I give it a 9.5, would have been a 10 but I just didn't like watching some of the sex stuff.""The supposed ""point"" of Brechtian films like the ones Van Sant has become (in)famous for (Milk amongst them) is for the audience to leave in such a way as they are forced to answer questions about social orders and ostensibly themselves.And I didn't find myself asking about ""How could prop 8 pass"" as I have a firm grasp on the unspeakable political power of the Evangelical movement. I didn't find myself asking ""How could the Twinkie Defense ever have flown?""

Characters we might meet on Castro Street,"Java Man Reviews ""Milk."" Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com January, 2009.OVERVIEW:The film opens with Harvey Milk (Penn) at the age of 48 speaking into a tape recorder and reflecting on the last 8 years of his life. His compelling journey began at age 40 when as a Wall Street wonder boy he realized that there is more to life than hiding in the closet and collecting paychecks. He meets and falls in love with Scott Smith (Franco) and they move to San Francisco to open a camera shop on Castro Street, where the gay community is being continuously harassed by homophobic police. The camera store becomes a gathering place for young gays, such as Cleve Jones and Anne Kronenberg (Hirsch and Pill), who are becoming increasingly active in the fight for gay rights. After several defeats, Milk is elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors where he meets and works with Mayor George Moscone (Garber) and fellow supervisor Dan White (Brolin). As the film progresses, these three men move inevitably toward a crucial moment in San Francisco history.REVIEW: 4 out of 4 Java MugsWe know how this ends: Dan White walks into Mayor George Moscone's office, kills him, and then continues down the hall and into Supervisor Harvey Milk's office and kills him. So how does this film hold our interest (not to mention earn a 4-mug rating from this stingy critic)? It holds our interest because all of the elements of great film-making make an appearance.It begins with Dustin Lance Black's compelling screenplay, based on a few short years in the life of a compelling character.It also takes outstanding performances to bring the screenplay's characters to life. Penn is brilliant as the charismatic Milk while Brolin is exceptional as the ticking bomb who is Dan White. Other performances are solid, too, especially Hirsch, Franco and Pill as Milk's political pals. The cast is so competent and well-directed that we forget that they actors, but consider them as characters we might actually meet on Castro Street.At the helm of all this is director Van Sant and his team of fellow artists who have used their film-making skills to take us back to another time. The setting is created in such a way that San Francisco of the seventies comes to life before our very eyes. The way they dress, the way they speak, the interior of the camera store--everything is accurate to the tiniest detail. Hand-held shots, close-ups, razor-sharp editing are all used effectively to evoke a sense of urgency and suspense.There is a remarkable shot near the end, showing a candlelight march reaching as far as the eye can see. This is actual footage, in which Van Sant manages to insert several of his characters. It is emotionally powerful.Each of the elements of great film-making mentioned here are represented by Oscar nominations for Black, Van Sant, Penn and Brolin. Then add 3 more for costume design, music and editing, and we can look for a few statuettes to find their way to the Milk contingent.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Chameleon,"I have to admit, that I wasn't aware of the real Harvey Milk, that this movie is based on. All I knew, when I watched it (before it got it's pre-Oscar nominations) was that Sean Penn was playing the lead role. I didn't even know about the great supporting cast (if you look at the names here, it's a who's who of young and upcoming great actors all gathered here).Sean Penn is again mesmerizing and he can really make you forget all about Sean Penn, you see the character he's playing. We're talking about one of the best actors having graced the cinema screen, but even he might not be enough for some. I'm talking about the subject of the movie of course. I won't say anything about it, but let's just say, that he's portraying a person who has a pretty difficult stand in society. And the movie, although it portrays things that lie way in the past, came out at a time, when a similar problem (law) came up ... It's essential viewing, despite what believes you might have ...",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"No rabbit, this Harvey","This film portrayal of the life and times of Gay Rights campaigner, Harvey Milk, while sometimes difficult to watch, nevertheless seemed to catch the zeitgeist of an important time in American politics when the homosexual lifestyle was under attacks from Bible-thumping zealots such as Anita Bryant and Higgins. I personally think some of the claims made on the DVD extra features comparing Milk to Martin Luther King and Gandhi are a bit overstated but then I'm not San Franciscan or gay and certainly admire Milk for the stand he took not only against the political but indeed physical threat that same-sex people had to endure even from the local police.Director Gus Van Sant captures the era using an almost fly-on the-wall documentary approach, intermixed with actual footage of the original time and almost without exception picking actors with strong resemblances to their real-life counterparts. It helps considerably having Sean Penn throw himself as one would expect, whole-heartedly into the lead part, although I suspect some concession to the box-office with gay love-scenes relatively underrepresented in the actual movie. That said, there's no escaping the campness and effeminacy of most of the lead characters which for me took a little getting used to until I realised Milk's central point that gays were being discriminated against just like any other minority just for being different.Milk is presented in a warts and all manner, including his predilection for falling in and out of love / lust with usually much younger men, his terrible fashion-sense and frequent bad- hair days. Nevertheless setting up his Camera Castro shop on a San Francisco main street and then standing up for his fellow-gays as their charismatic leader against police and then political oppression in the less than politically enlightened 70's unquestionably took guts and he sure had plenty. His tragic demise, along with his right-on town mayor by a surprising assassin's bullet at the film's climax came as a shock, if like me the viewer wasn't aware of the details of his life and death but this of course plays up Milk's martyr status and triggers the 30000-strong midnight procession by his supporters in direct response to his death, ending the film on an inspiring, positive note.I enjoyed this film more than I thought I would, ultimately sympathising, if initially unwillingly, with this irascible, contrary but ultimately likable character who stood up rather than be put down and I think his memory was well served by a capable director and a committed and talented lead actor.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A View of Greatness,"This is a remarkably acted film. Not just the Sean Penn performances (which is incredible), but the performances of an ensemble that so beautifully shows us that gay people are people with hopes, fears, and commitments. I recall the case involving the deaths of Harvey Mile and George Moscone in San Francisco. It was a high profile event at the time, but I wasn't mature enough in my views to care that much. This film embodies the cause and the pain and the sheer drive of the man in the title. He is portrayed as a relatively simple man who just happens to be gay, a person of great restlessness who finds himself in something bigger than he is. The film comes to life and carries us in its wave. It also recaptures the spirit of the time. It shows us what an amazing negative force Anita Bryant, a two bit singer, was able to wield over America. But, ultimately, it is a hopeful movie about the fundamental dreams of all people and how just being given the same rights as others is as hard as anything we face.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A good film, even if it seems to me something biased in its approach.","Going back to the Seventies and revisiting the figure of Harvey Milk is invariably watching the birth of something more than a movement for the rights of homosexuals. It is watching the rise of a lobby, which today is extraordinarily powerful, rich and influential enough to put the rest of society in check. This is Milk's legacy: a movement that no longer fights just for the right to respect or equality, but fights for power, for the control of society, as a brotherhood, a new Freemasonry.Focusing on the film itself, I think it is an interesting film. It begins with the move of Milk and her boyfriend to a San Francisco effervescent with social changes and dominated by the counterculture, and follows its trajectory of political and social activism until the tragic outcome. I think the film was quite faithful in the portrayal it made of Milk's historical figure, but I don't know if the portrayal of the other agents in this story (like Milk's opponents) was so rigorous and accurate. I think the film is concerned with glorifying Milk and the movement he started and, thus, takes a stand, demonizing or ridiculing the rest. But the cinema is full of politically or socially militant films, for one reason or another, and that is not what makes this film better or worse. It makes it only partial.Sean Penn is an excellent actor and did a very good job. He would highlight, especially, his way of acting and the way he adapted to the character. He actually embodied Milk and became him, deserving in all fairness the Oscar for Best Actor that was awarded to him by the Academy that year. I also really liked Josh Brolin's work, giving life to a man whose emotions and mental balance seem to walk on the razor's edge. The film also has a good secondary cast, with actors as competent as Emile Hirsch, James Franco and Allison Pill. Personally, I didn't like Diego Luna's work very much, I found it irritating and tiring.Technically, it is an equally good film. It makes an interesting and satisfactory use of the archival images, and inserts them in the middle of the film in a very successful way. Cinematography is very good, it is perfectly suited to the film and the period, not too vivid or too washed, and the filming is clear and sharp. The editing work is good and effective, and the sets, as well as the costumes, were very well done and were able to faithfully reproduce the time and the temporal and spatial context. The soundtrack is effective, but discreet.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A superb real-life story and an amazing performance by Sean Penn,"Definitely one of the Top 5 movies directed by Gus Van Sant, ""MILK"" brings a stellar performance by Academy Award winner Sean Penn in the role of Harvey Milk, the
first openly gay political representative in America, a trailblazer who fought for gay rights and also many other important social topics in his San Francisco community, a
man who lived, loved and died for a cause becoming a strong symbol of righteousness, activism and the fight for freedom.Back when it was released and the awards buzz was everything I was completely unaware of Milk and his activism, it took me some time to learn about the man, first in
the acclaimed documentary ""THE TIMES OF HARVEY MILK"" then this movie and ever since I was fascinated and captivated by his activism, heroism (by that I mean, that's he
human like anybody else with good deeds and flaws as well) and its huge importance in the LGBT community. A strong and resilient character who encouraged a whole
generation, formed new leadership and faced discrimination and prejudice from oppositors and even colleagues from his working position such as the hateful Dan White
(an amazing performance by Josh Brolin). Sure, there's tragedy and misery but there's also struggle, passion, love, the good fight when one wants their voice to be heard
and many accomplishments along the way.It's a very inspirational story well written by then newcomer Dustin Lance Black (nowadays, he's everywhere), and with solid performances by Penn, Brolin, Emile
Hirsch, James Franco, Alison Pill, Diego Luna (a very thankless role as the sad boyfriend of Milk), Denis O'Hare and Joseph Cross. But it's obvious that I was incredibly
amazed by Penn's commitment to the role since when you think of such a visible gay-themed film the name you'd least expect to be associate with it is Sean Penn, due to
his heavy macho characters. But here, he makes you forget everything you knew about his previous roles and he injects heart and soul in a emotionally charged performance
bring levity, humor and care for this real man. A genuine performance of a master. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Milky Way,"I'll begin by stating my general dislike of director Gus Van Sant: seldom has a director's own eccentricity in style and structure grated so abrasively against my nerves (I consider ""Elephant"" one of the worst films ever made); in most of my experiences with his work, I have been put off by his pretentious, avant-garde tendencies that pine so desperately to break through to the mainstream. And while ""Milk"" (easily Van Sant's best film) is often susceptible to distancing, distracting stylistic and tonal shifts, the end result is a heartfelt and optimistic true-life character study. Harvey Milk (played with immersive passion by an Oscar-winning Sean Penn) gained notoriety in the Castro District of San Francisco in the 1970s by bringing gay rights to the forefront of a repressive social climate, at first as an outspoken citizen, and soon after, as a political candidate. His growing achievements (that eventually result in his election to public office, making him the first openly gay candidate to achieve such status) are recalled in flashback, contained in a series of vignettes that chronicle the personal and political roadblocks and triumphs of this driven, determined man. While ""Milk"" is clearly Penn's show (and Van Sant wisely keeps him in nearly every frame), he is surrounded by a capable supporting cast, including James Franco (as Milk's supportive ex-lover), Emile Hirsch (as a volunteer who rallies the disenchanted masses), and Josh Brolin (as the not-quite-earthbound Dan White, a fellow city Supervisor clinging to ""moral"" values).",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
had to turn it off.....,"Due to the very very annoying loudness of the opera music. You watch a movie at a certain tone,then all of a sudden opera is blaring. Too bad it ruined the mood to continue watching it.This sometimes happens with some movies. I don't know why they didn't catch this when they made it. Not everyone wants to listen to the distraction of loud opera singers yelling during a movie. Such a shame....Though I do like Sean Penn ever since the movie bad Boys.

"Interesting, Fair, Propaganda, Gay evangelism, Over stated","I enjoyed the historical narrative and especially some of the B roll but what a silly way to convert the apolitical by including both sex scenes as a typical homosexual transient experience. On both occasions men had sex with each other within the hour of first meeting. You wonder why the outside world has strong opinions about the gay community.There really is nothing clever about this film besides being a rallying point for other young activists. I would have enjoyed some serious plots around discrimination but having snippets like a young disabled man threatening to commit suicide are emotive manipulation.This production has received high ratings merely because its an issue of the day, it would have been more effective as a real documentary there is no innovating writing or standout individual performances.If Hollywood wants to make political potshots they will have to do much better than suggest civil rights for black people is the same struggle that gays face.I would have given it a 5 pass but too many have over rated this.",,Anonymous,Biography

One of the best movie I've seen in years,"I recorded ""Milk"" about 3 years ago, but for some reason hadn't watched it until yesterday. I guess I was waiting to be in the right mood. I'm very familiar with the story, and thought it would be very sad to watch. But I found it over all very uplifitng and hopeful, in spite of the tragic ending.I lived in the Castro when this movie began in the early 70s, in my Irish grandfather's old house. My parents moved there when my dad retired, and he was a frequent customer of Castro Camera. Although I no longer wanted to live in a bustling city, I always loved the Castro area, and my friends and I were most welcoming to the Gays as they moved in and opened new businesses. There is a great deal of historic footage of the area. The entire movie seems very authentic.The script and all of the acting is excellent. But Sean Penn's portrayal of Mr. Milk is superb.

Milk,"Gus Van Sant took on the crucially important subject matter of the openly gay activist who sought to give a voice to the oppressed with his 2008 film, Milk. Starring Sean Penn, Josh Brolin, and James Franco, Van Sant introduces audiences to Harvey Milk, who assembles the gay community and injects their ignored needs and rights into the political system. I was sure Milk was produced solely as Academy Award bait, and I could not have been more wrong or happier to be wrong. The 70's problems Milk discusses are in no way only a problem of the past making Milk as important to see today as it was in 2008.On his 40th Birthday, Harvey Milk (Sean Penn) realizes that he doesn't have any accomplishments to his name and seeks to change that. Energized and supported by his great love, Scott Smith (James Franco), Harvey steps out of the closet of New York, where he is from, and moves to San Francisco's emerging gay community to start a business. Immediately feeling push back from some of the closed-minded neighboring realtors, Harvey decides to run for office in hopes to have a positive effect on the business and living restrictions forced upon gay members of the community. After two unsuccessful campaigns for a City Supervisor Board position, Harvey finally finds success and wins the election while amassing a large and vocal support base finally giving purchasing power to the repressed group. As the film spans Harvey's rise to politics, we also get to see his personal relationships mature and develop as his base grows. The audience also sees each new repressive measure unleashed by the masses in hopes to repress the gay community. A particular foe, Dan White (Josh Brolin), has trouble dealing with what he sees as a betrayal of Harvey on a measure he discussed with him that White believed would help the people of his district that Harvey was unable to support. White proves to be an unstable foe and will affect Milk's rise to power and the gay community in ways no one anticipated.Here is another backward narrative that I am so fond of. The film opens with Harvey narrating his history and letting the audience know what the end result is, but never making the revealed story anything less than engaging. Being a fan of technical aspects of a film, the most enjoyable part of the picture for me was what appeared to be a heavy reliance on hand-held cameras. Through most of the crowd scenes, it appears Van Sant used hand-held cameras to capture Harvey's activism. This was a brilliant decision by the director, allowing the audience to be as swept into the marching and protesting as the participants. There were also some excellent shots off reflective surfaces, as well. One shot that remains in the mind of the viewer is the one in which we see the body of a murdered man killed solely for his sexual identity reflected off the whistle he kept as the only measure of safety. Milk also flawlessly transitions between actual and filmed footage, a feat which often plagues a film. Sean Penn clearly immerses himself in the role, creating a wonderful characterization of the titular role. Milk neglects the safe route of being a film that is only made for Oscar fare and lasts as an important narrative that clearly addresses problems that still plague the nation today.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""All men are created equal....""","This was a very good movie.It depicts the story of Harvey Milk. A gay activist who fought very hard for his rights. I did not know a thing about who this even was until I saw this movie on the *more like this* row on the movie ""Ray"". And me, being a slight idiot, thought it was going to be about...well...milk. Turns out it was something a lot better than that. The only issue is that it did not show more about him when he was younger. Maybe they could not find research to do, I still wish we knew a little more about his past.Sean Penn is simply an incredible actor and can play just about any role. So of course, his performance was incredible. So was the rest of the acting. The performances were very believable.As for the cinematography, there are a few issues. I find that the graphics weren't ideal. They went from perfect, to a little grainy, to perfect again, to even worse. Some things felt a bit late, similarly to ""The Last King Of Scotland"", the gunshots were obviously fake. Everything in graphics was not ideal. But in audio, it was perfect. The sound was of great quality, I had it at 25% volume, and I could hear it perfectly. The soundtrack was great. I loved the opera. And the orchestral piece in the opening credits was great.As for realism, based on my research it was *very* accurate. One of the most accurate biopics I have ever seen, if not the most. Of course, every biopic has a few fictionalized scenes but this one has very few of them.It was not an entertaining movie. But it was not boring, see, in my opinion, a movie does not need to be entertaining to be incredible. This is not a popcorn movie to watch on movie night. It was a great movie, but not entertaining.

Masterwork,"This movie is one of the best, if not the best, movie biopics in Hollywood history. Besides being superbly directed and well-acted, the movie tells a story about determination and the affirmation of those values that made the United States great. Although Harvey Milk is the central character of this movie, the story is about much more than Mr. Milk's political career or his tragic death. Rather, it is a statement about courage in the face of extreme adversity and for standing up to what you believe is right. Harvey Milk could have played it safe, played ball with the powers that be, cut his deals with the other politicos and in the process become just another politician. But he believed in action and meant every word he said and for that he paid the ultimate price. For a public official to take an unpopular stand takes a lot of courage and guts and Harvey Milk had both those qualities. Yet the movie also contains the negative message, that by taking an unpopular stand one puts everything on the line, including one's life. It's a fact that the movie boldly examines. The deaths of Harvey Milk and George Moscone is a dark chapter in American political history. Hopefully neither man died in vain.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Penn Laughs!,"Many great--and even not so great--actors, it at least seems to me, give arguably their best performances when playing against type. I tend not to be very fond of the comedies of, for instance, Steve Carell, Adam Sandler, Jim Carrey, or Robin Williams and others before them in such vein, but their more dramatic work is sometimes excellent. Conversely, Leslie Nielsen was a rather undistinguished dramatic actor before ""Airplane!"" (1980). The lovely Charlize Theron won an Oscar for portraying ""Monster"" (2003). Matthew McConaughey revealed he could act when he stepped out of rom-coms. There's Henry Fonda as the villain in ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" (1968). Charlie Chaplin as a serial killer in ""Monsieur Verdoux"" (1947). Or, the rare feat as proclaimed by the tagline for ""Ninotchka"" (1939), ""Garbo Laughs!"" Well, in ""Milk,"" Sean Penn comes across as a nice guy. That he plays the historical figure of Harvey Milk, the first openly homosexual man elected to public office in California, seems less astounding than that he appears ""gay"" in the dated sense of the word as cheerful.""Milk"" is a solid and well-enacted, if largely standard and by-the-numbers, biopic besides Penn, but he obviously dominates the picture. The other thing I especially like about this one, however, is the exploiting of other art forms or media to form the plot. In addition to the usual oratory found on political soap boxes, Penn's Harvey narrates an audio recording for the framing narrative, which he tellingly says is only to be heard upon his assassination. Then, there's the camera shop he opens, with the film sometimes taking on the appearance of the photography of the era in which it's set, including some 16mm film and documentary style. Finally, there's the opera, which Harvey attends and is framed in the film as akin to Lincoln's assassination at Ford's Theatre. Notice that although that's not where Milk is murdered, it's the place he was shortly before and where he looks in the end.Although that makes it sound as though ""Milk"" is a downer, and, indeed, it is in that it ends in tragedy and covers the politics of America's history of homophobia, overall, this is a joyful and positive picture. We see Harvey lose election after election and the gay community abused by police and bigots repeatedly while their rights are taken away city by state, but, eventually, Milk successfully leads the effort against John Briggs and Anita Bryant's discriminatory campaigns in California and establishes the LGBT movement as a political force. And, now, the marriage debate that saw setbacks in California and elsewhere around the time this film was released has become history with the legalization of gay marriage throughout the country and much of the world.

So, given a great script, a great story behind it, albeit with tragic parts, and great support, this is a project that was almost a sure bet to materialize into something great, and it did.I would say most people with a passing familiarity of contemporary history know the basics of this story, and I feel no compulsion to spoil it or review its broad strokes, and It isn't something that needs much in the way of interpretation, although it could be used as a starting point to talk about number of significant issues.Penn's star turn alone carries the movie, but given the entire project that it's a part of, it has to be one of the better biopics, or films in general, of the zillions to choose from.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Penn is Golden,"Milk (2008)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Emotional story of Harvey Milk (Sean Penn), the first openly gay elected official. The San Francisco supervisor fights for gay rights, which will eventually put him up against another supervisor, Dan White (Josh Brolin). Throughout the movie I couldn't take my eyes off of Penn due to his incredibly strong performance, which is so against many of the other roles we've seen him in. I've always considered Penn the greatest actor of his generation and he just keeps adding to his legendary resume and I think it's reaching the point where you can easily put him along side other greats like a Tracy, a Brando or a Newman. I don't think the overall film is as great as many are calling it but there's no denying that Penn puts his heart and soul into bringing Harvey Milk to the screen. There were times that I forgot I was watching a movie because Van Sant really brings the film a documentary like feel and Penn's performance is so dead on that you feel like you're watching the actual guy. Everything from Penn's voice to his walk are perfectly captured so he certainly deserves a standing ovation. The supporting cast are equally strong with Emile Hirsch, Brolin and Diego Luna turning in great work. I think it's James Franco who really stands out with a terrific turn as one of Milk's lovers. I really enjoyed the visual look Van Sant gave the film as he mixes in stock footage from the day and puts it against the new stuff very well. I think this helps put the film back into the 1970's without a problem, which is good with a film like this. The costumes, set design and everything else hits the mark perfectly and the screenplay by Dustin Lance Black does a good job at mixing up all the political stuff with Milk's personal life. I don't think his relationship to Diego Luna was written too well considering what happens but that's a minor issue. I'm sure Penn and Van Sant wanted people walking out of the theater feeling for Milk and I think they succeeded at that. I'm not sure how many people's opinions will change on certain issues but this is still strong work by the two men.",,Anonymous,Biography
Powerful and heartfelt,"There are stories that need to be told. Stories of political movements, of ideas, of people who believed in something. Some of those stories are widely known, while others, like Milk's, aren't, or, at least, I didn't know it before watching the movie. Taking on such a job is, therefore, doubly commendable but, at the same time, doubly challenging. This movie did this job brilliantly.Firstly, Sean Penn is great in his Oscar-worthy performance as politician and gay rights activist Harvey Milk. He is able to show a variety of emotion throughout the film, from delight and conviction to guilt and sorrow. He refuses to portray Milk as a hero, managing to show him as a normal human who did what he though just.The supporting cast is good, with Brolin portraying a deeply flawed Dan White and Emile Hirsch, as well as James Franco, having their opportunities to shine as supporting characters.What sets ""Milk"" apart from other movies based on true stories is its extreme effort in the pursuit of historical precision. There is no idealisation, the supporting cast is made of good, but far from perfect, people. The commitment to realism is also shown in a couple of scenes (the appearance of the opera and the climax), where Dustin Lance Black's screenplay manages to use actual events in Milk's life for dramatic purposes, without needing to come up with anything fictional for the sake of entertainment.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
I'm here to recruit you.,"This is not just a great and important civil rights film; it's an inspiring true story about the political process and the power a leader can have by using tactics like honesty and integrity over manipulation and lies. This is also an example of how to make a successful biopic. The writer has to find the balance between the actual events and dramatic thrust. The actor has to become the person they're portraying; it's not just impersonation but actually understanding the life of someone else. Finally, the director has to figure out exactly how that particular story should be told. There are so many strong performances in this movie: James Franco and Emile Hirsch; Josh Brolin as the mysteriously tortured Dan White. Above all, I celebrate Sean Penn and the work he's been doing. Last year he proved himself a proficient director with INTO THE WILD, and now this is probably the most fully realized character of his acting career. His Harvey Milk is heart-warming and just an extremely likable guy, someone you'd want to sit down and have a drink with. Gus Van Sant nailed it. I've loved his more recent independent, semi-surreal dramas, particularly ELEPHANT and LAST DAYS. He could have employed the same dreamlike methods with MILK and gone the route of telling this story the way he told Cobain's in LAST DAYS, preferring visual poetry over traditional narrative. I'm sure that could have been a great movie as well, but Van Sant made the smart move by returning to a more mainstream approach. This is still an artistically satisfying film, and I'm sure a very personal project as well, but it's presented as an accessible, straight forward true story. This is a film for everyone, and people need to see this movie. I challenge anyone, regardless of your views, to go see this with an open mind and be able to keep a dry eye all the way through. If you can give it a chance and still not be moved, I would question your humanity, and that's the power of this very timely and effective film and the life of a man named Harvey Milk.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Powerful and moving,"True story of Harvey Milk (Sean Penn) and how he was elected as the first openly gay city councilor in San Francisco in 1978. It follows how he got there, how he got people to help him, his various campaigns before, his lovers Scott Smith (James Franco) and Jack Lara (Diego Luna) and his tragic murder (along with the mayor of San Francisco) by Dan White (Josh Brolin).As an out gay man it's about time this was made by an openly gay director! At first I found Gus van Sant's flashy direction off-putting but it quickly pulled me in. The story was fast-moving and I was totally engrossed. The two hours flew by! Director van Sant expertly mixed actual footage of events with the ones he shoot--I almost never noticed the difference! They caught the 1970s (when this took place) head on--the ugly clothes and hairstyles were accurate. The acting is superb across the board--Emile Hirsch, Diego Luna, James Franco and Alison Pill especially were incredible. Best of all was Sean Penn. He doesn't appear to be acting--he IS Harvey Milk! If this man doesn't (at the very least) get an Academy Award nomination there's no justice in the world. The only acting disappointment is Josh Brolin. He's a wonderful actor but we get no insight to his character--but then the movie isn't about him. The movie itself is shattering. I broke down crying three times--especially at the end (you also see actress Pill starting to loose it). Also, if you're worried about nudity, there's next to none here. Franco briefly bares his butt and Luna flashes his too--but that's it.A wonderful if depressing motion picture. Everybody should see this one! I give it a 9. I wanted to give it a 10 but it's so ultimately depressing.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pie Hit You In The Face Rights Advocates,"While the idea behind this film is a biographical story of Harvey Milk, to me it comes off as more of a story about the fight for human rights, a fight we are still in pursuit of. The acting & directing of the film are good. The story is a bit shallow though historic.What the viewer is robbed of here is a more in depth script which would allow Sean Penn to bring Harvey Milk more alive. Instead we are left looking for more than we get in this movie. The story while compelling is kind of left to carry the film alone, with the cast being left little script to work with.The use of documentary film throughout the film is nice, but oh how I wanted viewing it would like to see more life out of the cast. This is a case of a movie with the potential to hit it out of the park but leaves the runners on base instead. There is a strong message about human rights here, but when you compare it to the sci-fi picture District 9, the sci-fi movie leaves this one in the dust.The sad thing is that even after all these fights for rights we have had in the United States, it appears that because of advanced science and the Internet, we will soon be losing those rights. At least here, you get the feeling there is hope for those rights to become free rights for everyone.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not Sean Penn's finest hour,"A friend of mine told me he saw Milk in the theaters and that Sean Penn's performance was overrated. ""Instead of I Am Sam, it's I Am Gay,"" my pal said. Obviously, with that kind of recommendation, I had to see it for myself. I didn't want to be, but I was disappointed with Sean Penn and the movie as a whole. I loved his acceptance speech at the Oscars, but I felt he didn't try as hard as he could have.This biopic of the first openly gay California politician is filmed in an interesting documentary style that blends real footage with scripted scenes. While the hairstyles and fashion of the cast takes you back to the late 1970s, I couldn't help but wish Sean Penn had put as much into this movie as he had I Am Sam. It felt like he was walking through the role and relying on the real Harvey Milk's emotional affect on the audience, rather than letting his talent guide the story. In the supporting cast are political activists Emile Hirsch and Alison Pill, Sean's first boyfriend James Franco, Sean's second boyfriend Diego Luna, the infamous villain Josh Brolin, and Victor Garber as the San Franciscan mayor. Among the supporting actors, there's an incredible amount of passion that the audience can revel in, but all those people pouring their hearts into the sensitive subject serves as a double-edged sword: by comparison, Sean Penn's performance seems even more watered-down.If you like the cast, or if you want to see a biopic of Harvey Milk, of course you're going to want to watch this heavy drama. If you don't end up loving it, you're not the only one.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. Given the documentary style of the film, there are some unexpected zooms and handheld camera, and it will make you sick.

Empowering and Eye-opening.,"To be honest I knew nothing about Harvey Milk. Who he was, what he did, nothing. But I think that it made the movie all the more amazing to watch because in this process I learned.Everyone should see this movie. Not only does it educate us on San Fransisco history but it also educates us all on what is currently going on in the world and how important civil rights are to EVERYONE. I wish this film came out during the battle with No on Prop 8 because I think it would of made an impact on those who didn't understand the prop.I am so empowered by Milk. He has now become one of my heroes and I am motivated to learn more about him and those who support his movement.As far as the acting goes. I heard Matt Damon was originally casted as Milk. I am glad Matt Damon didn't do it because he has a specific image which would make it difficult for me to see him as Milk. Penn was casted perfectly as Milk. I was very impressed by his acting. He was very genuine and believable. Franco, who plays Milks lover, was also someone I was very impressed with. Franco, is now one of my favorite actors because he choose to do this film.Overall, I highly recommend Milk. I usually not a fan of biography type movies but this one is amazing.

Uplifts just as much as it enlightens.,"Since the earliest counterculture movements of the 1960's, America has been a country divided on many issues, the least of which being laws and rights put in place to govern the homosexual communities throughout its states. Like those that would follow in his marches of protest, Harvey Milk is an icon of his generation- or rather the ideas that both him and his immediate crowd believed in. While set around some forty years in the past, residing within a culture that has jumped some hurdles to reach where we are now, there still remains a certain poignancy to Milk's image of personal determination for justice; in fact, he's the perfect cinematic superhero. Such is director Gus Van Sant's strongest pulling point here; rather than sell out a cheap, soulless biopic that sticks to making messages and delivering historical facts, Milk instead plays out as a compelling and at times harrowing tale of passion for equality that takes time out of its political reservations to deliver a potent biographical portrait.Harvey Milk certainly didn't think he'd make it to his fiftieth birthday, so while there's doubt that he might even have survived to the age of ninety is a matter of speculation, but there's certainly no denying his importance within today's society, forty years onward. For the most part, Van Sant stays committed to this truth; the movie starts out at the turning point of Milk's life where he turns forty and relocates to San Francisco in order to find meaning in his life. Met with a large amount of disdain and prejudice he often found in his home state, Milk is soon pushed to make a stand against the thriving bigotry residing within America's conservative states that demean him and those closest to his own lifestyle.Harvey would go on to call them the ""us's""; for Harvey, he saw himself fighting for those suffering the same injustices as himself not just for fellow homosexuals but also for the people who simply did not belong to the key suburban demographic; those left at the sidelines picking at the scraps of the majority. This key theme allows Milk to reach beyond its ostensible politics and touch the hearts of a much more general audience, thus bridging the gap between Harvey's personal afflictions and those of his listeners. It's something the real figure would implement into his speeches when talking to a broader crowd, and it works just as well here, delivering a story that stays true to its cause but not to the point where the result is polarising or esoteric.The rest of Harvey's story, as they say, is history- and Milk does well to detail that story with historical fact without leaving out firm, engaging narrative to boot. Part of what makes Milk as compelling as it is lies in Van Sant's willingness to delve beyond the message of his central character and more into the man himself. Indeed, while there have been biopics in abundant measures over the past few months, none of those can claim a character quite like Harvey himself. Sean Penn's portrayal here is in remarkable in that it warrants recognition but not because it ostensibly reeks of a pandering Academy nature. No, instead Penn becomes a persona immediately discernible from those he has done before in as much of a naturally timid manner to which one can perform as such a recognisable, larger than life figure.Both Penn, and his co-star for the first third of the movie James Franco also deliver a romance that is unfiltered -cinematically speaking- by taboo or restraint; not only does it give the film a warm core to begin Milk's story with, but it also reaffirms the themes of Milk's ideals, that homosexuality should be nothing to be lynched for- Van Sant takes this into account and delivers a series of scenes which for all intents and purposes do not draw attention to themselves in an overt manner. Sure enough, there is relatively potent shock value present within the couple's first on-screen kiss, but such moments aren't played in order to warrant strong reactions; they are soft, dignified, and most importantly, human portrayals- something which homosexuality doesn't see much of when printed onto the big screen.In the end, such moments give Milk its centrepieces and do more to reaffirm Harvey Milk's message more than his broad speeches, marches and political activism could ever achieve; here Van Sant sets out to humanise the dehumanised, and achieves his goal. Indeed, as a tribute to a man that set out on his own to change his country for the better, Milk feels potent and credible but not at the expense of telling a good story. Granted there are a few narrative issues involving the general pacing of the script, yet Milk retains, for the most part, a strong, compelling story to match alongside its ideas and characters. Of course, we've all seen the same thing done over and over again, based upon fact or not, yet this underdog swimming against the current does extremely well in sticking to basics and delivering that final punch line of personal triumph resulting in a feature that uplifts just as much as it enlightens.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)",,Anonymous,Biography
A Message of hope.,"Macho man Sean Penn was an interesting casting choice as a gay man, and he delivers a fantastic performance! Penn stars as the titular Harvey Milk, an openly gay man fighting for gay rights in 1970 - a time when being gay could see you being arrested. Homosexuals was not accepted in society and political activists like Anita Bryant wanted to ""rid the society of these people"".The film is narrated by Harvey Milk, the character, who recorded his life story which was to be read in the event of him being assassinated. If you're familiar with his story, you'll know he was indeed assassinated in 1978. The film chronicles his last few years from 1970 to 1978 in his fight for gay rights, and his rise to power to becoming the first openly gay man to occupy a major public office. He was an inspiration to thousands, and a message of hope.The film also shows us the loves and heartaches of his personal life during this time. James Franco stars as his lover Scott, who helped Harvey in his rise to power. The film's antagonist, as it turns out, is Dan White (wonderfully portrayed by Josh Brolin) - a family man who couldn't handle defeat.The film will no doubt divide pro-gay and anti-gay opinions. Either way, this is a fascinating story of the pioneer for gay rights, Harvey Milk.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Fresh and moving, if not wholesome, Milk","Daring but not over the top, Gus Van Sant’s ode to the fallen gay-rights activist Harvey Milk is compelling, moving, and elegaic, successfully melding the hope of Milk’s drive for equal rights for homosexuals with his tragic death. Van Sant’s masterpiece, certain to be noticed around Oscar time, is poignant enough to mist even the most hardened of souls while remaining frighteningly relevant even thirty years after Milk’s murder.To be fair, writer Dustin Lance Black had wonderful source material from which to derive his screenplay, as Milk’s life was anything but placid, but he was able to tell his tale without getting sappy or maudlin, without the film’s devolution into a whitewash. But although Black’s screenplay is par excellence, this is Sean Penn’s show. Penn has grown so much as an actor, even though most film critics still note his seminal Jeff Spicoli performance from 1982’s Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Here, he disappears into the role of Harvey Milk, adapting some stereotypical - but not unheard of - mannerisms of gay men, but never going over the top, never coming close to lampooning his own subject. Penn’s grip on Milk’s inner psyche is devastatingly raw; he shows how much Milk cared about equality for all, even at the expense of life with his lover, Scott Smith (a pensive James Franco). This is a canard seen in many biopics, but here Penn’s Milk is not unaffected by how he affects others; he is not single minded, he is merely driven.Even though he has comparatively little screen time, Josh Brolin is Penn’s equal as Milk’s twisted - and also quite conflicted - fellow city supervisor, Dan White. Since this is a biographical movie, it’s not spoiling things to tell you that White is heavily involved in Milk’s murder, but at no point does Brolin make you think he’s just a hardheaded antigay jackass who’s out to bust anyone who’s not white and “normal.” But it’s not important how Milk dies, because the focus here is his life’s work and how it affected not only the gay community - in San Francisco and nationwide - but also the straights, particularly singer Anita Bryant, who got it into her pretty little head in the mid-1970s that God hates gays, and therefore gays shouldn’t get any rights at all. Her crusading begins in Florida, where she was once a popular orange-juice pitchwoman, and leads all the way to Milk’s backyard.Set against the backdrop of the turbulence that gestated in the late 1960s and grew to angry fruition in the 1970s, Milk captures the feel of the period, sans sanctimony and hand wringing. Penn’s work here should notch him his fifth Oscar nomination, perhaps even his second win; Van Sant should also get his second nomination as well. There really isn’t much negative to say about Milk, unless you’re bigot who’s ashamed of how well Milk makes the case for equal rights for everyone.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Milked too soon!,"Milk (2008) -What I enjoy about this film is the cleverly entwined pieces of archive footage that is blended very carefully with the newer recording using filters, appropriate camera work and of course, great wardrobe and locations.Sadly, you know that it's not going to be a great review when the costumes and props, Etc get the first bits of praise.Trust me, when you've worked your ass off onstage and then, in the bar afterwards, someone says to you ""The scenery was great!"", you know that they hated the actual performance.But to say that I hate this film would be going too far. I can absolutely see the importance of the central character's real life actions and the need to tell his story, but I don't necessarily think that they do it the justice that it deserves. Along with his disciples, Harvey paved the way to an easier life for people like me around the world and that shouldn't just be rushed together for the sake of getting a film produced.I wasn't around when the events depicted took place and my knowledge of Harvey Milk is purely based on this film, but even if some of the elements were fabricated, it's clear that he was doing a good for the community.Whether Sean Penn is any good in the role, I can't really say, but he didn't grip me. The other characters seem to be more prominent at times, considering it is his name in the title.When I watched it for the first time I remember that I enjoyed it, perhaps because it was a film showing a fight for LGBT rights, but ever since, as I construct my list of films and there ratings, I continually demote 'Milk' down the chart. It just hasn't kept my appreciation over the years and I have seen many other films that have a similar flavour, but are done a bit better in my opinion.First of all, it is a tad rushed. I think perhaps the focus should have been on the last campaign before his demise and the incident itself (His death is not a Spoiler, it's History and is shown fairly early on in the film anyway), which would have allowed more time to show the passion and the drama and given a snapshot of the man to feel sad about, when those left behind get together at the end. This element for me is lost, because too much is going on. There are so many other important people that need recognition as part of his band that he loses focus.Secondly, and I realise that it isn't meant to be one of ""Those"" types of films, full of nudity and sex, but it kind of makes a gay film boring. The relationships shown are either dull or the complete opposite, far too over the top. Once again, this may be a correct interpretation of those real people represented, but I find it hard to enjoy the romance included and wonder if the focus shouldn't have been more about his political career and less on what he actually did in the bedroom. His activism is why he got to where he was, the fact that he slept with men was why he was fighting and what lead him there, but his agenda and the legacy that followed and continues are the more important parts of his life.However, although the ending is obviously upsetting, there is also a beauty to the way that it is portrayed and here is where they get it right. The music compliments that awful moment and the use of actual photos is a great way to honour all of those involved that backed and helped Harvey Milk. A lot of whom should also be more well known and honoured in their own right.But there is just something about this film that doesn't enthuse me at all. It wouldn't however, stop me from exploring the real Harvey Milk's history or watching other films and broadcasts about him, as it has at least brought him to my attention and sparked an interest in him and his work. If nothing else, it may have done the same for others and hopefully inspired some of them to keep fighting the good fight.701.09/1000.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Propaganda film?,"The thing with biopics is that they tend to focus too much on their subjects even to the point of obsession, and in the process, they often ignore the fact that there are always at least two sides to every story. Milk is no different- and perhaps, it should not be. But when you go to see a Gus Van Sant film, difference is what you have come to expect (remember his mesmerizing opus on Columbine, Elephant): there is an unmistakable hypnotic quality about them. Milk is anything but hypnotic; at times, it becomes outright jarring.And of course, it relies too much on the performance of Sean Penn: that is its principal strength but also, in my opinion, its main weakness. There is no doubt that Mr. Penn is a superb actor, the kind who quietly slips into his character's skin. In Milk, he doesn't seek to re-interpret- or worse, re-invent- his real-life subject; instead he blends himself seamlessly into his character. So yes: you can still discern traces of Mr. Penn's temperamental volatility in the determined if somewhat power-driven gay-rights crusader, Mr. Milk. This makes the film so much more interesting.And yet Milk is really about Milk, the politician, and tells us very little about his personal life. For instance, his lover (played by Josh Brolin) is at best, two-dimensional. When he leaves him, we don't really know why. The script simply doesn't allow this aspect of Mr. Milk to develop.More to the point: by focusing almost exclusively on his several failed election campaigns, what Mr. Van Sant offers us is not so much a movie as a gay-rights propaganda film.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Powerful and effective,"Ignoring the experimental dream-like cinema that marked Elephant, Last Days, and Paranoid Park, in Milk director Gus Van Sant uses conventional biopic techniques to depict the life of Harvey Milk, the San Francisco entrepreneur who became the first openly gay man elected to public office. Employing a less-than-effective framing device that shows Milk talking into a tape recorder at the beginning and end, the film also relies on archival footage to make its point, showing police abuses against gays and Diane Feinstein announcing the assassination of Milk and Mayor Moscone outside San Francisco's City Hall in 1979.Borrowing one of Milk's frequently used introductions to his speeches, the tag line for the film might be ""I'm Gus Van Sant and I'm here to recruit you"". In the film, Van Sant wants to introduce Harvey Milk (Sean Penn) to a new generation who know him only as a footnote and, in the process, to gain mainstream adherents for the cause of gay rights. In that, he largely succeeds, though the film tends to reinforce homophobic stereotypes by allowing overly effeminate and flamboyant characters to dominate. Sean Penn's polished performance as Harvey Milk is the highlight of the film and one sure to be remembered at Oscar time.He makes the outspoken businessman a plausible and even lovable hero despite his insecurities. Also impressive is Josh Brolin as Supervisor Dan White and Emile Hirsch as street-walker turned political activist Cleve Jones. Opening in New York in 1970, Milk touches briefly on Harvey's pickup of a much younger Scott Smith (James Franco), at a subway station, and follows their relationship to their establishment of a camera store on Castro Street in San Francisco. Though Scott was Milk's live-in lover for many years and ultimately his first campaign manager, little attempt is made to show him or other peripheral characters in much depth, identifying them only by their sexuality and support of the movement that Harvey built from the bottom up.Depicting the growth of the gay community in the area that centered on Castro Street, Van Sant captures the entrepreneurial spirit of the gay businesses that flourished on the street, yet he avoids the not-so-attractive aspects of the area that became in essence a sexual ghetto  its conformity of dress and speech, the proliferation of gay bars and bath houses in the neighborhood, and its toll of alienated and depressed inhabitants. Harvey's mission from the outset of his political career was to encourage homosexuals to come out of the closet. ""The blacks"", he said, ""did not win their rights by sitting quietly in the back of the bus. They got off! Gay people, we will not win our rights by staying quietly in our closets... We are coming out! We are coming out to fight the lies, the myths, the distortions! We are coming out to tell the truth about gays!"" Milk's two losing campaigns for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and his close defeat in his race for the State Assembly did not dim his determination or sense of purpose, however; yet it was only when districts were reapportioned to ensure neighborhood preferences that Milk was able win election as a Supervisor. He became more than a one-issue official, lending his support to unions and the urban poor, his populism reflecting the basic belief that rebuilding neighborhoods was essential to achieve the American Dream. Milk organized his constituency into an effective political force which effectively faced the challenge of fighting Proposition 6, a statewide initiative to prohibit gays from teaching in the public schools, effectively legalizing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.While Milk is a message movie that unabashedly promotes a point of view, it transcends didacticism to become a human statement about the struggle of all people to achieve dignity, acceptance, and basic human rights and its depiction of the torchlight parade of 30,000 people to San Francisco City Hall on the night of the assassination is a magic moment. The film begins and ends with Milk expressing his love for another human being, a statement that the success of the gay rights movement will be ensured only when people are seen as human before they are seen as gay or straight. Ironically, that may happen only when the gay and the straight identities are subsumed into a broader understanding of what it truly means to be human.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Van Sant and Sean Penn create a 'fabulous' look at the life of Harvey Milk,"Wow... I still have tears. ""Milk"" is very heart-breaking, yet even more inspiring to see the life of Harvey Milk portrayed (more like 'embodied') by Sean Penn and director Gus Van Sant in such an uplifting and (yet again) inspiring manner.

Sadly I think Franco and the VERY over-looked Diego Luna will be missed come next year's Oscar nods, however Oscar vet Josh Brolin and Oscar rookie Emile Hirsch are most-likely to receive a nod for their performances.Gus Van Sant's directing of this incredible cast makes a perfect blend of great film-making with great acting to make this film a perfect candidate for Best Picture and more.

"Christian Conservative, Deeply Moved","Going into this movie (watching it on Blu-Ray, rather) I had mixed expectations, ie what type of homosexual acts would I see on TV, what kind of propaganda would I hear, etc. I didn't expect to be as moved as I was, however. Yes there was guy on guy action, but it was tasteful, and didn't belittle the relationships the men had with one another by displaying the intimacy in a comically graphic light. The implied scenes were just enough to let you know what was going on, but the camera never lingered, and therefore the scenes were never uncomfortable.The movie itself made me realize how shallow and judgmental my perspective on homosexuality has been. Some Christians may think that it is a disease, a sickness that needs to be purged, but it can't be. These people identify themselves as homosexuals because of who they are on the inside much like blacks and Hispanics identify themselves based on their skin. You can't change that, and you shouldn't deny people their rights because of who they are. They are not criminals, they're human beings trying to live the freedoms that were promised to them.The way this country treated gays was unacceptable, and the way the church pushed Prop 6 was disgusting, and Milk helped me see the error of our ways. I do not think there is some huge gay agenda to snatch away our children, I think there's hope for the children who are confused about their feelings, and I see now the fight to make that a possibility.I laughed, I cried, I cringed a little bit when Penn and Franco kissed, but ultimately I finished this movie with a new perspective of gays, and of myself.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Merica,"Real-life American hero Harvey Milk had a dilemma around the time he hit his 40s: though he had a fervent passion to help people, he couldn't quite figure out what to do with his life and where he belonged. All of that changed, or so says the valiant dramatization of Milk's tumultuous rise to political icon, when he unfettered the shackles of his longtime corporate job to hit the streets of San Francisco and became the first openly gay man elected to major political office in the history of our country.We've all heard of the deplorable and nearly obstructive rigmarole Spike Lee had to go through in order to make his highly influential Malcolm X a reality. Milk director Gus Van Sant no doubt had to go through similar travails to tell such a story... only he had a great deal of help, what with a cast including Josh Brolin, Emile Hirsch, a surprisingly versatile and accomplished James Franco, Alison Pill, Diego Luna, and--of course--Harvey himself: Sean Penn. There's no doubt about it: however he did it, Gus Van Sant got it done, and he did it with his prototypical flair.It's truly awe-inspiring the way that Van Sant so effortlessly vacillates back and forth between slightly more conventional, if not deftly constructed, fare such as To Die For or Drugstore Cowboy and his far more intimate artistic experimentation of the ilk of Last Days and My Own Private Idaho. He, unlike any other filmmaker I can think of, is truly able to delve deeply into the realm of the Academy Award audience and cable viewership at large, then come back for another round of Gerry or Elephant. I'm just glad to see that there's proof that you indeed can step back and forth between popcorn and caviar.Milk opens, not too surprisingly, with a gut-punch. This is a movie about a very homosexual man who lived, at least in Van Sant's vision, a very homosexual existence. Within the first five minutes of the film, Milk is already hitting on a far younger James Franco in a subway, they mash faces before knowing the other's name, and seconds later are already naked and rolling all over each other, later sharing some birthday cake in bed. From here, the rest of the film grants us the equally unapologetic vibrancy, tenacity, and vivacity of Harvey Milk's final years, of his near-decade in the public eye as he helped to define and embolden the American homosexual community, particularly in the San Francisco Castro district. Employing techniques utilized by fellow biopic directors Lee and Oliver Stone, much of the film is a beautiful and ethereal tapestry of stock footage and news reels melding with the well-crafted dramatization itself.And with a perfectly haunting yet subtle score by Danny Elfman--back with Van Sant for the first time since his equally stunning work on To Die For--the movie, as if often the case with Van Sant's corpus, allows you to completely transcend, to lose yourself in the moment, and to become one with the images you're watching on screen (no matter your sexual preference). In fact, the pastel colors of the gay community and mid-late 1970s Frisco environ allows the film to further pull you into its phantasmagorical dream as you drift languidly through time and through some rather heady incidents in our nation's tempestuous contemporary history.Milk is as much about the history of the Gay Rights Movement, particularly the development of Castro Street and San Francisco as a hardcore gay haven, as it is about Harvey Milk the man. At one point, our protagonist admits to a potential financial backer that he's not a candidate but a movement. It's an apt quote, to be sure, as the real conflict with the film is less about Milk vs. The Machine and more about Milk the political pundit vs. Milk the man, a very seemingly gentle, generous, and loving man who sometimes has difficulties making enough time for his various friends, lovers, and hangers-ons as he does for his political rallies... even after one especially tragic event that befalls one of his most cherished partners.Still, throughout I kept a bicameral mindset: easily lost in this magical tapestry of volatile history and dreamlike wonder, while forever contemplating Van Sant's singular style. As with Elfman's score, undoubtedly his best to date and finally of a slightly different flavor, Van Sant has reached back into his bag of tricks fine tuned through his ambrosial ""Death Trilogy"" to come back with something that is both popcorn and caviar, that is both intimate experimentation and accessible commercial fare. Much as with his main character, Van Sant has truly found his knack for combining his personal flair with his public composure.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"See ""The Times of Harvey Milk"" instead...","I am conflicted about this film because I loved the 1984 documentary ""The Times of Harvey Milk."" The documentary version was so powerful and really a terrific film, that I kind of resent the Hollywood Milk stealing any of its thunder. On the one hand Milk: The Movie is Gus Van Zandt's masterpiece (and it is in many ways), but maybe also a bit too much of ""Sean Penn: The Movie."" Then again I'm in danger of being too cynical because Sean Penn's performance is definitely bravura; it has so much heart and soul (though maybe not as much as the real Harvey Milk in the documentary). What I loved best about Milk is the retelling of a fascinating chapter in the history of gay and human rights. Harvey's operatic love affairs, not so much.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
masterpiece for eternity,"Some years ago I saw the documentary ""The Times of Harvey Milk"". Gus Van Sant has finally brought the career of San Francisco's first openly gay city supervisor masterfully to the screen as a film. Sean Penn plays Harvey Milk perfectly, showing what led him to become a community organizer and the struggles that he had to overcome even after rising to prominence.Obviously, part of this movie's significance is because of Prop 8 in California. Anita Bryant's homophobic campaigns - depicted in ""Milk"" - look almost exactly the same (every time that she spoke, I could hear everyone in the audience groan). More than anything, as the film makes clear, it's important to understand that there have always been impediments to progressive movements, but it is always up to the people to keep trying and never give up hope.I wholeheartedly recommend this movie. Dan White (Josh Brolin) sure was a nut. Also starring James Franco and Emile Hirsch.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Milk is a masterpiece!,"It was difficult for me to stand up after seeing Gus Van Sant's masterful MILK. The lights had already come on so my puffy eyes could be hid no longer but I had forgotten how to move. I was too engulfed with sadness and dismay. All I could think about was how far we think we've come as a supposed progressive people. Harvey Milk, the man whose story Van Sant is telling, was elected into public office in the late '70's in San Francisco. He was the first openly gay man to be elected to any significant level of government in American history. He was also shot and killed after being in office for less than a year. His last major political accomplishment was successfully campaigning to defeat a bill called Proposition 6. This bill would call for the dismissal of all openly gay school teachers and any persons who supported them. The bill had already passed in a number of other states and fear was mounting that even the country's most gay-friendly city might follow suit. Harvey wouldn't have it and ultimately, neither would San Francisco, or all of California for that matter. Why then are gay men and women still struggling to be treated like human beings to this day?MILK picks up Harvey Milk's life in the eight years preceeding his assassination. In that time, he meets a man who would become his lover for many years; he moves from New York to San Francisco to find new challenges; and he runs a number of times for public office as an out and proud gay man. He also loses a number of times but Milk was not a man who could easily be deterred from his very important goal. It was Milk's mission to represent his people; to show the city he loved that the gay population was one of the reasons that the city itself was so well loved by all who visited and that they too had a powerful and reasonable voice. Milk was committed to making sure that voice was heard. Van Sant, an openly gay man himself, is just as committed to the cause but his part is very different. Even today, the image of the gay man is still being sold to mainstream, or straight if you will, audiences in a delicate way. Van Sant's Milk is an ambitious entrepreneur. He has a strong character, funny and flighty one moment, romantic and intimate the next and always dedicated to the bigger picture outside of himself. Apparently, painting the gay man as human is still necessary because many still haven't figured it out for themselves.Of course, Van Sant can't get all the credit as he is only as strong as his parts. In this case, his parts are all perfect. ""Big Love"" staff writer, Dustin Lance Black's sensitive screenplay is heartbreaking and genuine. Director of photography, Harris Savides, who has brought a dreamlike lucidity to Van Sant twice before on GERRY and ELEPHANT, goes back and forth between archival and new footage seamlessly planting the viewer in both the historical context and the surrounding human drama. Danny Elfman fills the soft space with a score so layered, it can easily be described as his most original work in recent memory. And then of course, there are the men. I will never describe a straight man playing a gay role as an act of bravery. I will, however, always applaud an actor's ability to shed their entire ego and transform into another being so fearlessly. The caliber of the mostly male ensemble cast of MILK seems raised by a desire to do justice to this important man and the difference he made. James Franco as Milk's longtime lover continues to show versatility that I never expected by embodying support and strength. Josh Brolin, as the fellow city supervisor who ultimately kills Milk, gives a ferociously internal performance that is in constant turmoil. And though I have never been as huge a Sean Penn fan as most would appear to be, I am a devout admirer now. Penn's performance is a rarely achieved transformation  one so believable and so gripping that it lifts the entire film to new levels of excellence and inspiration.MILK is not only a Gus Van Sant career high but also an instant American film classic and a contemporary gay film masterpiece that, like the revelatory BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, transcends the gay experience and steps firmly into the human experience. If only for that reason alone, MILK has the potential to be more than a film and be part of a movement. After all, if there is one thing that Harvey Milk fought so hard for for so long, it was to be seen as a man who deserves the same human rights as his neighbours. Thirty years after his death, the fight he fought is still ongoing and thanks to Van Sant, Harvey Milk is back to help make sure it finally gets won.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the big screen's best biographical pictures,"San Francisco councilman Harvey Milk was assassinated by his fellow board supervisor Dan White in 1978. I am not giving anything away by saying that ""Milk"" ends with an assassination attempt. It is one of the greatest death scenes in mainstream Hollywood film, as played out in deadly showdown chicanery by terrific Sean Penn (Milk) and Josh Brolin (White) performances. We all know the outcome of the confrontation but it appears with such a sleight of hand it blindsides us all. Those of us who fell in love with director Gus Van Sant's previous movie ""Paranoid Park"" and interpreted the corridor walk Dan White undertakes beforehand to be directly parallel with the young skateboarder's school stroll might anticipate it. Both ended up committing murder, yet no two murders could be any different. Mr. White pleaded his innocence at the later trial by claiming an irregular diet of junk food had caused his hormones to flare out of control. The burden he was carrying, however, pales in comparison to Mr. Milk's story. Surviving the suicide of multiple lovers, shockingly, barely makes the footnote section.Read the full review: http://www.sightforallseasons.co.nr/",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
a timely and inspiring biopic,"How fortuitous a thing is timing. Released only a few weeks after the passage of Proposition 8 - a ballot measure that took away the rights of same-sex couples to marry in California - Gus Van Sant's Oscar-nominated film ""Milk"" turns back the clock to another, similar struggle in American civil rights history and to the iconic figure who helped to wage it.Harvey Milk was, of course, the San Francisco supervisor and gay-rights pioneer who, along with Mayor George Moscone, was gunned down in city hall in November 1978. The perpetrator, Dan White, a disgruntled fellow board member who had recently resigned his seat, was found guilty of manslaughter (using the now infamous ""Twinkie Defense"" to get the lower charge), sent to prison for a mere five years, then released in 1984, only to take his own life two years later.Dustin Lance Black's Oscar-winning screenplay traces Milk's meteoric rise from an obscure, still largely closeted Republican businessman in the early 1970s to the de facto leader of the gay-rights movement that began to take shape during that decade. He became the first openly gay man in the state to be elected to public office and, in 1978, he was instrumental in helping to defeat Proposition 6, which, if passed, would have made it illegal for homosexuals (and even straight supporters of homosexuals!) to teach in California public schools (was this really only thirty years ago?). Throughout all this, Milk managed to develop a large, highly charged grass roots organization, the purpose of which was not merely to combat bigotry wherever it reared its ugly head but to win over the hearts and minds of the people in their community and the nation as a whole.There has been some criticism leveled against the movie that it is too reverential in its treatment of Milk, that it paints him too much as a saint and not enough as an ordinary human being with the requisite number of weaknesses and flaws to make him truly viable as a character. Even if one were to accept that charge (which I do not), it still doesn't take into account the very special quality that Sean Penn himself brings to the role. With obviously heightened mannerisms that he is careful never to allow to slide over into caricature or camp, Penn makes Milk both charismatically larger-than-life and recognizably human at one and the same time. Whether he's in front of a crowd rallying the troops with his megaphone or enjoying a tender moment with his longtime boyfriend, Scott Smith, Penn allows us see the many facets of this obviously complex man.In a movie chock full of outstanding supporting performances, James Franco as Smith, Josh Brolin as Dan White, and Emile Hirsch as Cleve Jones, a rootless young man inspired by Milk to become a lifelong activist, are the obvious standouts.As a director, Van Sant keeps things moving at an almost whirlwind pace, beautifully balancing the ""big"" scenes of rallies and marches with the more intimate moments depicting Milk's relationships with those around him. At times Van Sant brings an almost documentary-style immediacy to the film, seamlessly blending actual footage from that era (much of it of Anita Bryant and her anti-gay crusade) with convincingly staged re-enactments of events at that time. Obviously wanting to end on a positive note, the movie mentions but does not dramatize the ""White Night Riots"" which took place in the city following the assassinations, instead focusing on the enormous candlelight march that wended its way through the shocked and devastated city. Thus, the ending, like the movie itself, is a necessary and deeply moving reminder of how the courage of one individual to stand up for what he knows is right can inspire others to follow in his footsteps - and change the world in the process.By opening with file footage of men being arrested at a gay bar then carted off in paddy wagons to be booked as ""sex offenders,"" ""Milk"" makes the viewer realize how very far society has come in the time since the events depicted in this story - and, with the recent passage of Proposition 8, how very far it still has to go.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Splendid and Important Film,"MILK is one of the more powerful bio-epics produced by Hollywood. Harvey Milk, the man honored by this superbly crafted film by writer Dustin Lance Black and directed by Gus Van Sant, is brought to life by Sean Penn in his most skilled performance of his fine career. Not only is this movie an homage to Harvey Milk, but it is also a shaking reminder of the ferocious ongoing battle for Civil Rights. Few viewers will come away from this film untouched.The life of gay activist Harvey Milk is well known, as is his assassination as he finally reached a platform where his voice could be heard. Black and Van Zant have wisely started the story with some black and white footage of the abuse of the gay population across the country and then ease into the biography by showing us Milk in New York, approaching his 40th birthday and discovering Scott Smith (James Franco) as the beginning of not only a tender partnership but also a change in Milk's drive to make a difference. The climb to importance from his migration to Castro Street in San Francisco and the 'recruiting' of his clan (Emile Hirsch as Cleve Jones et al) and the struggles he faced in gaining acceptance of a minority group is the stuff of legends.Penn is extraordinary, but Franco, Hirsch, Josh Brolin as Milk's assassin, and Diego Luna as the kinky Jack Lira turn in excellent performances. Van Zant is unafraid to show the tenderness among his characters: it is satisfying to see prominent male actors take on roles that include same sex intimacy. This is a film that deserves to enter the archives as one of the 'greats.' Highly recommended. Grady Harp",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Mayor of Castro Street,"Harvey Milk was the first openly gay man to be voted into major public office in America, and before his assassination in 1978, an influential advocate of the human rights movement. The film opens with Milk talking into a tape recorder, as he fears he may be assassinated the next day. Gus Van Sant uses this as a narrative through out the entire film, taking the audience through Milk's adult years and the battles he faced to public office.MILK is resurrected for 128 minutes and channeled through Sean Penn. Penn devours every nuance of Harvey Milk and delivers one of his best performances in 10 years. His performance alone is worth the price of admission and I expect a great award season to follow. James Franco, Josh Brolin and Allison Pill shine in their respective rolls.Gus Van Sant delivers this story with his unique vision, artistic shots and impeccable storytelling. There is one reflection shot in the film that just blew my mind when I realized what I was seeing the scene through. It involves a whistle; I'll leave you to find it. MILK never loses pace; it's truly a beautiful marriage of artistic craft meets history. His blending of the film with live footage transports you back to the 1970's as if you were watching it all unfold again for the first time. Van Sant has given us a moving, powerful and important work. I have a feeling once this film is open up to the mainstream audience, it will spark many debates and hopefully open up dialogue in the Human Rights movement.Watching MILK did not just make me think of the struggles and sacrifices of the human rights movement. MILK brought up the struggles of many hard fought battles and their leaders. John Adams in securing our freedom, Abraham Lincoln and the emancipation proclamation, Susan B. Anthony campaigning for women's right to vote, Martin Luther King leading the civil rights movement, there are many more who sacrificed so much for their people and nation, I believe Harvey Milk to be in those ranks.There is a quote from John Adams that I remembered while watching MILK and I believe it sums up the essence of the man; ""Oh, posterity. You will never know how much it cost us to preserve your freedom. I hope that you will make a good use of it. If you do not, I shall repent in heaven that I ever took half the pains to preserve it. "" - John Adams This film comes to us at a crucial point in the human rights campaign. MILK needs to be seen, it needs to be discussed, and Harvey Milk needs to be remembered. I hope you go see it!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Van Sant and Penn make a fabulous film.,"Milk is the latest from Gus Van Sant and tells the story of California's first openly gay elected official, Harvey Milk played remarkably by Sean Penn. From the outset this film, despite its serious messages, is warm and informative and everyone involved should be proud at getting Harvey's story to the big screen. Seamlessly mixing stock footage, old photos, news reports and new film Van Sant weaves a San Francisco in 1978-79 that is so believable that it gets its hooks into you as I'm sure it did for a lot of gay men at the time. Penn is so convincing as Milk that you can forget it's him up there and once again really go with the flow of the movie right up to its chilling climax. The supporting cast are also great, the soundtrack familiar and the cinematography really brings to life the area injecting it not only with the blossoming scene and the start of acceptance but with the underlying bigotry and violence that helped shape the course of the lives of all involved. It is testament to the films excellent pacing that allows the viewer to submerge themselves in this world so that when the final act comes I have to say, regardless of already knowing the outcome (its no secret), I cried like a baby. This true story is one that needed telling and after seeing this I find it hard to believe that anyone other than Van Sant and Penn could have done it justice. Excellently made and a must see.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"One extraordinary performance in one fine movie, which has the usual Hollywood self-congratulatory blemishes","Milk is Sean Penn's best-sustained performance since Fast Times at Ridgemont High. I'm not joking and I mean it as high praise. Penn, at least in those movies of his I've seen, starts strongly and then dives into that famous Penn intensity that some consider acting with a capital ""A."" In Milk, Penn early establishes Milk as smart, empathetic, self-aware, even gentle, playful and lovable. Penn doesn't lose those qualities, and adds to them sadness, commitment and shrewdness. Penn doesn't give in to what must have been a great temptation to turn Milk and Milk's issues into a Hollywood-style, self-congratulatory showboat performance. Unfortunately, Gus Van Sant does that.The first half or so of Milk is an outstanding movie that combines acting, issues and characterization in a just about seamless manner. We get to know and like Harvey Milk. We understand where he's coming from. His authenticity as a gay man isn't played for kiss-on- the-lips shock value, just for who Milk is. His growth as a gay rights activist -- and a shrewd one -- is not presented with rants and melodrama. His defeats and then success in San Francisco politics is given to us understandably and with wit. But then we get to Proposition 6. For me, Gus Van Sant caricatures the struggle, throwing up the proponents as oily monsters, setting up Milk as the sole voice of humor and reason, who scores points while all those coiffured PTA moms register disapproval. (This isn't to minimize the importance of the issues, how loathsome many of the advocates for Proposition 6 were or the role of Milk in winning a great victory for basic human rights.) The last third of Milk, for me, changes from an intensely sympathetic story of an interesting man and the issues he fought for to the kind of brave screed for human rights and justice that the Hollywood establishment latches on to only when the danger has past and it's safe for them to take a stand. Not only does Van Sant seem to forget Milk as a human being, but we also find ourselves in the Hollywood version of processing Milk for sainthood.It seems to me that homosexuality in Hollywood films has for a long time been played either for easy laughs or for tawdry or vicious melodrama. Then Hollywood entered it's brave phase of gay love, with young men metaphorically running across the fields to each other in slow motion (sometimes on horse back), or whispering dreamily to each other of their hopes and plans while wondering why people can't just let them alone.Milk gets it right in my view. Harvey Milk flirts, gets horny, kisses right on the smacker, laughs, loves to jump in bed with someone he either loves or who just turns him on, has love problems, believes in issues that are important to him, makes good choices and bad choices. Well, gay or straight, male or female, don't most of us? Sean Penn makes Milk not just believable but matter of fact. It's a terrific performance.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
History brought alive.,"Despite its theme, this is a pretty straight movie  a straightforward biopic, that is, from Gus Van Sant, a director with a varied bag of credits. It is also a thoroughly satisfying piece of work. It is not just Sean Penn's energetic Oscar winning performance  he did something similar as a Huey Long-type demagogue in a re-make of ""All The King's Men"" a few years ago which was a complete flop. The supporting characters are well drawn and the dynamic atmosphere of San Francisco in the 70s is beautifully evoked. Similar things happened in other big cities around the world in the same period, not the least here in Sydney, but the San Francisco story was given special poignancy because of Milk's eventual assassination.That's not a spoiler by the way, since it's pretty clear from the start what's going to happen. Harvey didn't want to die in the cause of gay liberation, but he was prepared to. His nemesis, ex-policeman Dan White, nicely played by Josh Brolin, is motivated by jealousy as much as anything else. He is a dull underachiever who has gravitated into politics after failing elsewhere  the anti-gay ideology merely a convenient posture. The result of the California-wide poll on the anti-gay proposition 6 in 1978 indicates that White got it wrong  most Californians were not as homophobic as he thought. Milk himself thought White was probably a closet case.While the film gives a pretty positive picture, it does not shy away from Milk's shortcomings. A volatile and emotional man, Harvey found it hard to advance his political career and maintain his personal relationships at the same time. After the third or fourth unsuccessful campaign, Scott Smith (James Franco), his long time lover, walked out, and his next partner Jack Lira (Diego Luna), admittedly unstable, committed suicide. But Harvey plugged on, and had he lived, given the peculiar demographics of San Francisco, might well have become mayor. True, there was the inevitable conservative backlash, but 30 years on we can see a vast improvement in the status of gay people in most first world countries. This is a fine film and a fitting tribute to someone who indeed made a difference. The Oscar winning1984 documentary ""The Times of Harvey Milk"" told the story, but this film brings Harvey to life again.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

A San Francisco story of great relevance,"Combing the writing of Dustin Lance Black with the direction of Gus Van Sant and a tremendous cast of actors has made MILK a great film of such relevance today with the fight to revoke Prop 8 in California. Sean Penn is absolutely out of this world as Harvey Milk and his performance is one to remember when Oscar comes along. Penn takes such an important character of San Francisco history, and makes Harvey Milk come alive with gestures and speech that are real to that moment in 1978 which the film presents. Josh Brolin and James Franco are marvelous in their roles and so are the rest of the cast.Having lived in San Francisco in 1978, I remember the Milk/Moscone events as if they were yesterday. With the powerful film, MILK, 1978 becomes 2008 as civil rights and gay rights are still being fought on the battle lines and the remembrance of gay heroes such as Harvey Milk makes the struggle today once again, a sign of hope for change.Congrats UCLA Film, Theater and Television for providing MILK with its writer, Dustin Lance Black, and for the talents of James Franco.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
We gotta give 'em hope  Milk,"I have to admit that I forgot Gus Van Sant knew how to make films with a linear storyline. The man is a visionary with My Own Private Idaho standing as one of my personal favorites and, a little more recently, Elephant being a testament to craft succeeding beyond a need for dialogue. But of course, the film everyone loves is that Damon/Affleck darling Good Will Hunting, and I do too. Mix them all together, add some non-fiction, and you'll come close to Milk, the real life tale of Harvey Milk, the first openly gay person to be elected to public office. Here is a man that stood up for civil rights; stood up for humanity itself. A mountain of a man inside of a slight frame and genial disposition, Milk never forgot his roots or put himself ahead of the movement. The ""Mayor of Castro Street"" didn't fight for issueshe fought for lives. It's a story people need to hear; a story, not about gay rights, but about what it means to be alive, to live and breathe freely, without fear of always looking behind you. It's about being accepted for you.Our hero is the narrator, orating a goodbye letter via cassette tape just in case one of the multiple death threats he receives happens to come true. Milk sits at his kitchen table remembering the good times and the bad, the fights won and lost, on his journey that changed history as we know it. This man single-handedly stood against the system for the gay community to finally shed their insecurities, to believe that someone was on their side. A New Yorker stuck in a dead-end job, hiding his real identity to keep work while cruising the streets and subways for sexual encounters, wakes up on his fortieth birthday to move cross-country and start it all over; this time making his life one of meaning and hopefully something to be proud of. That prophetic night in bed, with his new love and muse Scott, began a revolution that no one saw comingnot America, not the gay community of San Francisco, and definitely not Milk himself.Milk truly fires on all cylinders. The story is dynamite, one that I'm ashamed to admit I knew very little about  besides a cursory knowledge of who Milk was and an off-handed idea of ""the Twinkie defense"" without actually knowing any details of it. I've heard a lot about the documentary The Times of Harvey Milk, and after checking out this film, I really want to see it to get more of the facts and see the actual people involved, moreso than the quick photos shown before the ending credits here. And the acting cannot be faulted at all  well maybe it can where Diego Luna is concerned, however, his role is meant to be over-the-top and not well liked, so in fact he might have done it perfectly. I've already mentioned Sean Penn, embodying this man completely, who will most definitely get a nomination, and, a nostalgic bid to give Mickey Rourke gold withstanding, probably a victory. The thing I love about Penn is that no matter how big he is in his celebrity or how recognizable his face is, when he portrays a role, it is always just the character on screen.A large cast of faces you know and love, mixed with some up-and-comers that may trigger a memory of seeing them before, fill out the film nicely. Guys like Joseph Cross and Denis O'Hare add some authenticity and Alison Pill holds her own as really the only front and center female role. Besides Franco, though, two more men demand special mention, and they are Emile Hirsch and Josh Brolin. Hirsch shines as Cleve Jones, a charismatic kid from Phoenix that, like the others around Harvey, takes to the political activism and begins to enjoy fighting for change. And then there is Brolin, continuing again in his career renaissance as the troubled Supervisor Dan White. Battling his own demons and his own identity in a community that expects certain things from him, White's story is just as heartbreaking as Milk's, even if he is the cause of everything tragic that occurs. It is a subtle performance that shines bright as a result.But it isn't all about the people, it is also very much about Van Sant's unique visual eye. He utilizes many tricks from his repertoire: the final walk by Brolin in City Hall calling to memory Elephant's long takes of character movement and the title cards for Milk's campaign bearing a resemblance to Idaho's similarly colored locale headings. However, it is the precise handling of the subject matter that shines. From the cut scenes of archival footage, real newsreels and interviews with people such as Anita Bryant, to the graphic stylings of voter punches falling through the air, to a magnificent shot mirrored off of the side of a whistlebeautiful to behold and meaningful due to the reason they were assembled for that scene to begin withit's all memorable. Even his use of static close-ups help tell the emotive workings of all that is going on.

The story follows him from the opening of the Castro Camera shop to his final hour and eventual murder by fellow Supervisor Dan White.What I found to be particularly great about this film is that, no matter how small the part was, each actor took particular care in making it memorable. Every actor did brilliantly. There could not have been a more perfect choice for Supervisor Milk than that of Sean Penn. He goes out on a limb to play a man who had stirring convictions that what was being done to the gay community was wrong and immoral, and he was going to do something about it. The bravery it took for Milk, and all of those involved in the movement, to even walk down the street astonishes me. Every time they take a step outside, they are putting themselves in harm's way because society has deemed that what they are doing makes them criminals. How ridiculously wrong a group of people can be. And I think that is really what makes this story so inspiring and emotional. What an amazing group of people.Though he plays the assassin, Josh Brolin gives to the audience probably the strongest supporting performance in the film. Playing Dan White, Brolin shows a man who is looking for an ally in life, someone on the Board supervisors that will support him, and he finds that in Harvey. But when Harvey refuses to throw a vote his way, Dan is infuriated and starts a campaign against Milk and everyone associated with him. Dan White is such an emotionally broken man, and in one scene at Harvey's birthday party, he confronts Harvey in a drunken state. It implies that maybe Dan is on Harvey's side in more ways than one. The tragedy is, though, that if Dan White were gay, he was so concerned about his reputation that he couldn't allow anyone to know, and he couldn't allow Milk or gay-friendly Mayor Moscone to go on living in opposition to him.I love how Gus Van Sant used the opera house in the end. As Milk falls to his knees, gunned down and good as dead, he glimpses the opera house. And such a beautiful shot it is, too. Great direction from Van Sant.Though Harvey and Mayor Moscone are dead and gone, their memories will continue to thrive and give hope to a people sorely mistreated. Though not here to continue the fight in person, Harvey will live on in our hearts and minds, and though dead, he will NEVER be defeated.A 10 out of 10 for a triumphant and powerful experience!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Civil Rights & Civil War,"Gus Van Sant has always been an underrated film director, and his recurring theme of homosexuality and male-sensuality has always made his movies a bit edgy and always full of artful imagination. 2008's MILK shows just how great Van Sant is, it shows what he's capable of in terms of bold thematic content, narration and combining those elements of art and politics into a piece of brilliance. The casting is one of the best ensembles I can remember; Emilie Hircsh, Diego Luna, Alison Pill and Josh Brolin are all terrific, and especially James Franco as Harvey Milk's lover truly gets under your skin - and off course, Sean Penn as Milk himself is will I say his greatest performance and one of the most memorable of the decade; this is an all-round transformation into a man and his life, the physicality and the heart & soul of Milk couldn't have been portrayed better, I mean - this is what acting is all about and it should anchor him any award out there.The narration is brilliantly put together by Milk recording himself onto a tape in his kitchen, real footage-shots of the famous Harvey-Milk documentary and fantastic vignettes in which all these great supporting characters gets the time and place they need to captivate.The powerful story of Harvey Milk is just as up to date in 2008 as back in the mid 70s, and whether or not you support the gay rights this shouldn't ruin your film experience, because the film speaks for human rights, and it speaks for the minorities. Milk was a maverick and a pioneer that rose up and didn't bow his back for the law, he wanted change and he became the first openly gay man ever to be elected into major office. The dialogs are tender and they carry a great importance, and although there's a lot of heartbreak, political and moral issues, there's a fantastic flow of vibrant humor and sexuality. The music does just the same, it flows around with beautiful compositions and suddenly we're given David Bowie or Queen, and it always feel natural and carefully paced.It's a daring movie with a detailed production and Gus Van Sant claiming his place among the most original film directors of his generation.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Sean Penn shines as Harvey Milk in a very, very good (if not masterpiece) docu-drama","Sean Penn rarely plays genuinely likable people, and maybe rightfully so; his career has so many people who aren't likable, who are villainous or corruptible or just really flawed beyond repair (Mystic River and Sweet and Lowdown come to mind), that it's slightly a niche to see him in that mold. But Milk breaks it, to a small degree: we know he can play likable or genuinely good people, but it takes a role like Harvey Milk and subsequently as good a movie as Milk turns out to be to remind us how amazing he can be as one. And Harvey Milk, while not a perfect person or without one or two minor flaws (he is a politician at heart so it's impossible not to), is one of those truly heroic figures that blazed trails and formed a real community out of Castro street and San Francisco and, eventually, across the country, got a lot of people who were in the closet and were afraid to come out to rise up to the challenge of gay rights. The late Milk, 30 years later, gets the star and the movie he rightfully deserves.And better than anything is that the picture can be accessible to those who may not go right away to see the latest gay/lesbian film (if you decided deliberately to stay away from Brokeback Mountain, then this just isn't for you either, though you probably already know that and/or aren't even reading this). Even its weakest player, Diego Luna, is at least fascinating to watch, and the entire ensemble props up Penn's fantastic work here: James Franco, Emile Hirsch, and especially, most notably, Josh Brolin as Dan White, who was a fellow city supervisor with Harvey Milk and eventually killed Milk and the mayor over a ""junk-food"" craze and is played by Brolin as perfectly uptight (likely closeted to boot) and who brings in a lot of nuance and subtlety to a role that could have been played in an overwrought tone or pull. Indeed, there was never a scene with Brolin that isn't less than amazing (and most of them show how well he goes head-to-head with the likes of Penn).While my one minor complaint about the movie might be some of the broad strokes painted over Harvey's love life(s) with Franco and mainly Luna's characters (the latter especially is very two-dimensional, if that, which maybe can be blamed more on the script than the acting or direction), it doesn't make Milk any less of a must-see. Van Sant, as director, pulls out what is a comeback from the years of unadulterated art-house experimental films (some great, some not) into what is closest for him for being mainstream. He connects with the material and the subject matter so strongly, and not just as a given for being homosexual; he embraces the ""inspiring political saga"" story and does very well mixing together the heartfelt dramatization with the real footage on the news of monsters like Anita Bryant and the coverage on the news.Another director might have made a good bio-pic out of this, but Van Sant, after navigating through a first half which is always interesting if slightly rushed, crafts most of all a very powerful, incendiary docu-drama that has obvious relevance for the current events (Prop 8 in California), but is never less than immediate anyway. The homosexual community needs a movie like Milk just as much as they needed the man, a voice in the ""machine"" for their concerns and problems. It's an important, if imperfect, piece of American ""issue"" film-making.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent and powerful biopic,"We came to this knowing little about the man, the politics, or the circumstances but by the end we were impressed.Compared to most biopics this has chops - particularly Penn's performance is not his usual tirade but far deeper and more developed - the rest of the cast are excellent and there is top-notch performances from all.We liked Milk most of all as it is a passionate and lively film. It has a sense of a story worth telling and is told well. My only gripe was that it was slightly less complex that we would have wished - everything is too linear and simplistic - but it is a minor gripe - we were certainly gripped and entertained the whole two hours.Overall, an excellent and powerful biopic and one that deserves a wide audience.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Milk: A Review.,"It's a bitter irony that a major film about the iconic gay rights leader Harvey Milk should premiere in theaters across the country less than a month after Proposition 8 passed in California by voter referendum, thus barring gay marriage, for the moment. Similar laws were enacted in a number of other states in the country. One could imagine Milk may have been disheartened at such news, coming three decades after his efforts toward the civil rights struggles of a people. But, after seeing ""Milk,"" the newest movie about his activism, politics and life, one could imagine that he and his sizable movement would be all the more determined to bring about equality for gays and lesbians.Appropriately, the picture is shot, by Director of Photography Harris Savides, largely with a documentary-style aesthetic that is both no-nonsense and candid, frequently mixing footage from actual marches, television reports, newspaper layouts and the like, into the rest of the film in a way that is relatively seamless (thanks, in part, to fine editing by Elliot Graham). My only quip about this is that perhaps the new scenes made for this film could have had a more grainy aesthetic to more thoroughly blend with the archival footage. But it's only a minor issue in a movie that is visually well-presented. The handful of new black and white stills pictures that Harvey takes of his partner, Scott, are particularly intriguing.The resemblance to a documentary style of film-making doesn't end there, of course. Since this drama is about real people and events, there's bound to be some aspect of it that feels like a documentary. ""Docudrama""  with the emphasis on the first half of the word would be a convenient and apt description for this film, if one must categorize. In some ways this new film is a remake of ""The Times of Harvey Milk,"" a first-rate documentary directed by Robert Epstein that appeared nearly twenty-five years ago. If there's any drawback to the current ""Milk"" it's that it covers so much of the same ground as the older film that those who have seen Epstein's project already know much of what will transpire in the new version. Aside from that, the newer ""Milk"" does delve more deeply and satisfactorily into its main subject's personal life and, because of its status as a docudrama, Van Sant is able to utilize the tools of creative and dramatic license at his disposal much more freely than Epstein could have, to greater emotional impact. We see more actual dialogue and relationships between Milk and his partners, friends, colleagues and others, something that wouldn't be likely with a regular documentary. In this way the subject at the center of attention of the new film seems more soulful, more human than he would otherwise. (That's not a criticism of Epstein's film.) So does everyone around him. The movie does a remarkable job at making all these people seem real.The creative team captures the look and spirit of the Milk's time and place quite well, due in no small measure to Bill Groom's production design and Danny Glicker's clothing (and all that big hair). The actors look remarkably similar to the actual people they portray, with the centerpiece being the magnificent Sean Penn (""All the King's Men,"" ""Mystic River"") whose resemblance to his subject, Harvey Milk, is so uncannily close in appearance and voice one could mistake him for the actual person. It seems that Penn's looks did not have to be modified much as he looks much like Milk to begin with, though Milk's hair seems a bit curlier. The film is a treasure-trove of fine acting from its major players.""Milk"" will be remembered, in the very least, as one of the milestones in gay cinema. But, it deserves a higher honor: recognition as an important film about civil rights, and recognition as an important film, period.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Stunning Story telling and a brilliant portrayal by Penn,"i loved this movie... i wasn't expecting Penn's performance to be so nuanced... i mean taking nothing away from Penn he's been great in everything he does right from I am Sam to Mystic river.. but somehow his method acting overtakes the realism of his characters... you know he is playing the character not necessarily being the character... To make a mainstream movie on a subject like gay activist is still a huge taboo... you have to lace it with all sorts of generalism and pass on the Gay part of the story as some appendage or you go the sensationalized way ... this movie is truly path breaking in that respect... it treats the subject with a maturity rarely seen ... the intimacy between Penn and Franco's characters is brilliant... Emile Hirsh as the nervous and at the same time effervescent young activist are all brilliant... the only two characters who cut a sorry figure are the otherwise brilliant josh brolin and Diego Luna...The Story telling is brilliantly interspersed by the archival footage. I admit i had no clue about Harvey Milk ( i am not from USA so pardon me for that) but the Story telling , the recreation of the 70s the pacing everything is top notch . Harvey Milk deserves to be known by everyone... not because he was Gay... but because his struggle could easily inspire any minority group which doesn't fit in...Gus Van Sant Take a Bow.. this is true cinematic Triumph!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Penn Soars in Van Sant's Intimate Biopic of an Unlikely Hero,"The combination of Sean Penn's fully immersed performance in the title role and Gus Van Sant's (""Good Will Hunting"") assured, almost understated direction transforms first-timer Dustin Lance Black's episodic screenplay into an emotionally riveting film that does the subject justice. This 2008 biopic could have been timelier only if it was released prior to the November defeat of Proposition 8, which eliminated the legality of same-sex marriage in California. Now there is a melancholy twist to the way the film documents the triumph in failing to pass the Briggs Initiative, a ballot proposition that would have outlawed gays from teaching in the state's public school system. The champion behind its defeat was a former insurance actuarial statistician named Harvey Milk, who moved with his much-younger lover Scott Smith from New York to San Francisco where they hoped to find acceptance of their lifestyle.Using as a running narrative device a tape recording that Milk made nine days before his assassination and interspersing archival footage, the film's plot follows Milk's growing political consciousness in face of the pervasive discrimination and violence against gays in the 1970's. He opens a camera shop in what was only beginning to be known as the Castro. Although Smith tires of his partner's obsessive activism and leaves him, Milk himself finds success as an openly gay city supervisor after two previous failed attempts. While on the Board, he meets the highly conservative Dan White, a family man struggling with his finances and personal demons. Things come to a head when White feels betrayed by Milk for his lack of support over banning a psychiatric hospital in White's district. At the same time, Milk was facing the daunting task of curtailing a burgeoning conservative movement led by former beauty queen Anita Bryant (whose newsreel appearances lend an eerie virulence to the story).The fight over the Briggs Initiative provides the film's eruptive climax, and the subsequent tragic events are all too familiar  especially to those of us who lived through them exactly thirty years ago. Van Sant wisely plays down the sensationalism in favor of a more human portrait of White during those times. Josh Brolin (""No Country for Old Men"") gives an impressively textured performance as the embattled White conveying the inner conflict of a man who could never reconcile his traditional family values with the radical acceptance of the gay movement. Although he has less to do, James Franco is effective in showing Smith's ambivalence toward Milk's increasingly high profile. Also surprisingly good are Emile Hirsch (""Into the Wild"") as street punk-turned-gay rights activist Cleve Jones and former child actress Alison Pill as lesbian campaign manager Anne Kronenberg. The one fly in the ointment is Diego Luna (""Mister Lonely"") who plays Milk's lover Jack Lira as a pathetic co-dependent.Nonetheless, it is Penn who brings his chameleonic skill to the fore as Milk. His natural intensity is offset by an affability that is at once compelling and heartbreaking. More importantly, he provides the gravitas necessary to the tragedy of a voice that was silenced far too soon. Van Sant and Black do provide moments that seep into manipulation, such as the opera leitmotif and the inspiration provided by a wheelchair-bound teenager, but the resulting excesses are forgivable given the power and relevance of the subject. Strongly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Without hope, life's not worth living.","I won't go into the legacy of Harvey Milk except to say that he was a champion for the LGBT community, especially in his efforts to get everyone to be honest and come out of the closet so that all of us could see that we had friends, relatives, teachers, and others in our lives that were gay, and that was OK.I won't say anything about the slime on the right depicted in this film except to say that their plan backfired. Yes, the battle for equal rights for all Americans is still being fought, and battles will continue to be lost along the way, but right will win in the end.The movie was excellent, and I really liked the way news footage from the period was intertwined seamlessly to make the experience more real.Josh Brolin, who I just saw in W. the other day, was very good and there was a tortured underbelly that was not revealed. Maybe I am just to the point that it never surprises me when a right wing bigot turns out to have secrets.Sean Penn was magnificent. He was Harvey Milk, and he was the movie. Everyone else just supported his superb performance. I will be very surprised if he doesn't get an Academy Award for this performance.An excellent movie. Not superb, but well worth seeing.

Pitch perfect 70s political biopic,"'Milk' follows the brief political career of controversial and charismatic San Francisco gay politician, Harvey Milk, who was assassinated in 1978. Milk has since become an icon of gay political activism and a defining figure in the monumental civil rights changes of the 1970s for gay men and women - though he was not universally regarded by his peers during the time.Sean Penn offers an awesome performance of humanity and sheer acting craft in depicting a character who is only off-screen for seconds, while contemporary newsreels intersperse the dramatic action to provide the historical narrative context. Milk is engaging, lovable but flawed and self-absorbed.More detail of his complex character is related in Randy Shilt's book 'Mayor of Castro Street' which is an essential companion if you are drawn into the story of the man and the issues. I cannot see why you wouldn't be, as it's a fascinating story of time and place.The Castro itself is the other star not on the bill. This compact district of Eureka Valley west San Francisco effectively became the world's first gay ghetto back in the early to mid-1970s, in an episode that made it a haven for unhappy,alienated and horny(!) homosexuals from across the USA whilst at the same place dispossessing its traditional Irish-American population. The film tries, in the brief space it has, to document this social upheaval as it plays out.Anyone that knows the Castro (as a visitor - guilty!) can see quite a few scenes were filmed on it, adding a piquancy to the story and another example of the love lavished on the film by its cast, crew and its director Gus Van Sant. Personally, I dislike many of his films finding them elliptical and pretentious, but 'Milk' is pretty straightforward and has a mainstream feel. Maybe a little too much like a 'studio' movie, but at least the stylistics don't get in the way of the story telling.Probably most astonishing is how recent these events actually though some of the sentiments expressed feel they come from another time completely. But then, as it was still technically illegal in the early 1970s to serve alcohol to a homosexual in a San Francisco bar, should we be surprised.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Milk Review, LGBTQ History","""Milk"", directed by Gus Van Sant, is a biopic of the first openly gay elected official in the United States, Harvey Milk. Set in 1970's San Francisco, this movie is filled with both hopeful messages of the gay rights movement and also emotional trials for Harvey Milk and his community.In a strategic move that sets the scene as Harvey Milk being a martyr for the gay community, the film opens immediately with the fact that Milk and the Mayor of San Francisco have been assassinated. Harvey Milk, played by Sean Penn, opens the movie with a flashback to a recording of himself discussing the possibility of his assassination for his supporters the people around him as a member of the Board of Supervisors in San Francisco. This recording is cut in and out of throughout the entire film, with Harvey discussing many of the things he accomplished and also the many difficult times he faced. Milk, originally a relatively closeted insurance seller in New York City, is shown picking up a younger man in a subway station and ultimately share an intimate sexual scene. This man is Scottie Smith, played by James Franco, who ultimately becomes Milk's partner and eventual campaign manager. This scene is intimate, casual, and almost a lighthearted juxtaposition to the seriousness of the opening scenes about an impeding assassination. The movie continues on with Harvey and Scottie in San Francisco, with Harvey transforming into a bearded, camera store owning, openly out, resident of the Castro district. There are countless scenes of the lives of Harvey and Scottie and the surrounding happenings in the Castro eventually lead to the politicization of Harvey Milk. This change in his character is closely linked to the scenes of bar riots and corrupt police in the city during this time. The movie is focused mostly on the campaign and leadership of Harvey Milk, with many empowering scenes of gay pride, speeches of hope, and intimate moments between Harvey and his lovers and peers. Harvey's relationship with Scottie eventually comes to demise, and his struggles with this can be considered a major part of the plot of this film outside of the obvious political movement that is clearly the focus. The second relationship that is portrayed in this movie is with Jack, another man much younger than Harvey that comes knocking on his door looking for help with his psychological and drinking problems. Ultimately portrayed as unhealthy, this relationship is on Harvey's mind through many major moments in the movie while Scottie seems to have distanced himself. The final acts in the movie are scenes where Dan White, a fellow councilman, assassinates both Harvey and the Mayor. His motives are not made clear, and historically are also inconclusive, but the scenes are very ""Hollywood"" and include dramatic elements that are more than likely not as historically accurate as other parts of the movie. The assassination act itself is not a focus in this movie, with the scene only really lasting about ten minutes out of the entire two-hour film. Nicely wrapping this film up is the stunning display of the vigil that took place in San Francisco in honor of the victims of the killings.Overall, this movie portrays Harvey Milk and the ear of gay liberation in an extremely positive and tasteful way. Sean Penn's Milk is incredibly powerful and ensues the heroic qualities that Milk in real life surely had in order to lead these sorts of movements and protests. That being said, there is a bit of an issue with how big the role of this one man is made to seem in this movie. There is a lack of understanding of the community that was already in place in San Francisco when Harvey and Scottie arrive there, as it almost seems like Harvey Milk is the only reason that anything political really took form in this community, when really it was the work of so many men and women trying to get rights for themselves and their peers.The portrayal of Harvey and Scottie and Harvey and Jack is also something to be questioned about regarding the historical accuracy of this film. While the portrayal is arguably a positive one of homosexual relationships in comparison to the negative portrayals often seen in Hollywood, it is important to note that this is romanticized for the purpose of the viewer, as there are discrepancies on how these relationships went in Harvey's real life. I would argue that this is not super important to the portrayal of Milk as a man, it should be noted when critically looking at this film.""Milk"" overall can be taken as an honorable movie about an extremely honorable man. A biopic that is beautifully shot and scripted to be more historically accurate than many other movies take an attempt to reach. This film has ""normalized"" portrayals of gay relationships and the gay community in general from this time period. The added elements of movie making that went into this sort of Hollywood production should not take away from the overall message of hope and love, that surely Harvey himself would want to be taken away from this story that ended so tragically.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A victory for new queer cinema,"Gus Van Sant's Milk, the biopic of martyred gay rights activist Harvey Milk, arrives at a crest of a tide of new queer cinema. The Oscar-winning film represents progress in gay filmmakers' autonomy as a kind of celebration of a gay icon who worked to secure gays and lesbians greater rights in society. It also tempts mainstream viewers with its edgy, transgressive subject matter. For these reasons and others, Milk is a cinematic triumph.The feature opens with Harvey Milk taping his last testament, which is to be listened to only ""in the event of my death by assassination."" It then moves to a vignette of Milk making the moves on a young Scott Smith on a N.Y.C. subway staircase. Milk tells Smith after they become involved that on his 40th birthday, he hasn't done a thing he's proud of. He wonders if he'll make it to see age 50.The couple relocates to San Francisco, and Milk opens a camera shop on Castro street, which will become his political stage of sorts. Milk discovers his knack for organizing people and at last, his vocation is found: politics. The leader of the Teamsters walks into the camera store and asks Milk if he can get his people to help with the not-so-successful Coors beer boycott. Milk gets Coors beer out of all of the gay bars in the Castro area, and a week later the Teamsters' union hires openly gay drivers for the first time. Milk soon receives the title ""The Mayor of Castro Street."" Director Van Sant doesn't rein himself in too much, resorting to the type of creative flourishes you'd expect in one of his newer films and not in a by-the-numbers biopic. Milk campaigns for supervisor of the California State Assembly and many of his slogans are illustrated for us on posters that take up the frame. As attacks on gays spike in the area, the gays start using whistles to announce when one is getting physically assaulted. One homosexual is murdered, and Van Sant shoots an entire scene using the reflection of Milk talking to a cop in a tiny, bloodied metal whistle.For the most part, though, the film simply tells the story of Milk's rise and fall. Harvey repeatedly runs for supervisor and eventually wins an election by 30%, against sixteen other candidates. Milk becomes a dedicated foe of sizeable corporations and real estate developers, but especially a proponent of gay rights. A civil rights bill prohibiting discrimination based on sexual affiliation is signed into law with Milk's participation. The next issue that Milk faces is the Briggs Initiative, also known as Proposition 6, which would make the dismissal of gay teachers, and any public school employees who support gay rights in California, compulsory. A new battle is on.Actor Sean Penn is masterful in his portrayal of the grandiose Milk, and his Oscar win is well-deserved. A maven of details, Penn takes on his subject's circumstances, mannerisms and psychology. The stellar cast is rounded out by other natural wonders, including Emile Hirsch as activist Cleve Jones, James Franco as Milk's paramour and friend Scott Smith, and Josh Brolin as Milk's fellow supervisor Dan White.As everyone knows, Harvey Milk was assassinated - and it's likely that some of his power only increased with this tragedy. In the film, he says that not only gays but all minorities have to be given hope. The film seems to work best when understood as part of a greater social conflict: the one for basic equality. The aftermath of Milk's murder includes riots, and why not? Harvey is a relatable figure. When he calls Scott Smith close to the film's climax and Smith tells Milk how proud he is of him, we can empathize and perhaps realize something we, too, have done to be proud of. And just before the credits roll, as the filmmakers show us the actors' faces and juxtapose them with their real-life counterparts, showing us what became of them, the movie's magic gives way to the present-day reality of this struggle's fruits. Milk is Van Sant's multilayered, very alive, utterly engaging masterpiece. Bravo, Mr. Van Sant.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Extremely well acted drama.,"Harvey Milk (Two time Oscar-Winner Sean Penn) is a forty year old gay man living in New York City with his lover Scott (James Franco). They decided to move in San Francisco in the early 1970's. They moved to Castro street to open a camera shop but they welcome the gay community as well in a time, when the police were extremely brutal to homosexuals. Slowly Harvey changes the community and tries to run for office in the city. After a few failures, he finally succeed to supervisor in the city and successfully changing a few laws including gay rights for the first time in history. But a homophobic politician named Dan White (Josh Brolin), who works for the Mayor George Moscone (Victor Garber). He doesn't like the changes of Harvey that gives in the city. Dan will do anything to ruin Harvey's choices.Directed by Gus Van Sant (Drugstone Cowboy, Psycho ""1998"", To Die For) made an intriguing fact based drama on a true story. Penn is extraordinary good in his second Oscar-Winning performance as a charismatic gay rights leader. The cast are really strong here... especially Emile Hirsch, Brolin in a Oscar nominated role, Franco, Diego Luna as Harvey's second unstable lover and Alison Pill as Harvey's loyal assistant. It was one of the most critically acclaimed movies of 2008. Van Sant keeps things movies and it feels like a documentary at times but perhaps the film never really achieved greatness as some viewers would expected. Excellent performances are the high point here.The DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.

"A Poignant Look at a Great Man, as Well as Sean Penn's Greatest Performance","Milk is a biography drama film that tells the story of Harvey Milk, a gay rights activist who became the United States' first openly gay elected official, up until his assassination by Dan fellow city supervisor Dan White on November 27, 1978. The film was directed by Gus Van Sant, and he does a really, really solid job. From the very opening of the film, it's clear what this film's intent is- to get you invested in Harvey's life, what happened to him, and the plight of the gay community in San Francisco at in the 1970's. This is all achieved, in quite a brilliant way. Harvey's political career was cut extremely short, as he didn't begin running for office until his forties and he was only city supervisor for eleven months, but his impact was felt. He was the leader of the movement that was taking place in San Francisco at the time. It is clear that Van Sant really does try to keep the film historically accurate, and it does not appear that there are any fabrications to the story, although it is clear to anyone with knowledge on Harvey and his life that some things have been cut out. The film opens with Harvey meeting Scott Smith, his longtime boyfriend, the night of his fortieth birthday, so anything that happened in his life before that point is not explored, although this really works to the films merit. 
The way this narrative is woven throughout the film is what makes it such a strong piece. In the beginning, it is explicitly said what is going to take place by the end of the film, so that the meat of the viewer's focus is brought to the events as they take place, and how we get to the eventual outcome. The performances here are fantastic, with Sean Penn's sincere and bubbly performance as Harvey Milk being one of the best of his career. His chemistry with James Franco as Scott Smith is also just fantastic. The people around Harvey, his political team and his friends, are incredibly likeable, interesting, and well acted. The story and time setting of this film is what really sells it. It is extremely engaging, very well thought out, and establishes an absolutely great symphony of different moods throughout its duration. The costume design and the way in which this movie is shot really establishes the time period of this film extraordinarily well. There's shots during scenes in which Harvey's giving speeches from a crowd, that are either shot from a crane overhead or from right in the crowd, which are incredibly engaging, and establish mood very well. There are a lot of very memorable scenes in this film that really compel the viewer to sympathize with the movement, and Harvey's dedication to being able to not just be gay, but openly gay in America. Harvey's occasional narration through tape recorder is a great technique to keep the story moving, and it adds great depth to his character. While the dialogue is pretty well written, every now and again it feels a little manufactured, with dialogue setting up the next event, but it's still very serviceable and not too distracting. It's not only a landmark in biography and LGBT film, but an important historical film as well. I absolutely love this film. 9.0/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Top notch performance from Penn in a stirring biopic,"Gus Van Sant's ""Milk"" is a biopic of Harvey Milk, the first openly gay man elected to public office. The movie follows him from his arrival in San Francisco to his ascension to office and, ultimately, to his untimely demise.Sean Penn won an Oscar for his portrayal of the title character with a performance that ranks as one of the best (perhaps the best) of his career. Josh Brolin also lends quality support with a performance that garnered an Oscar nomination. The rest of the cast is solid, though James Franco seems a bit out of place.The Oscar winning script by Dustin Lance Black does a good job of capturing the vibe of the times and the character of Harvey Milk. The story takes a little while to get going and some of the shifts in time-frame feel a bit arbitrary but, on the whole, the story is told with ample flair.Van Sant's direction was nominated for an Oscar and it's hard to argue with that distinction. The film's successful recreation of the period is shown by the Oscar nomination for costume design while the editing also landed a nomination. On the musical front, Danny Elfman's score was also recognized with an Oscar nomination.Although ""Milk"" is a film about gay rights I think that the film-makers did a good job of widening the appeal by presenting it as a civil rights story. So, don't get the impression that the film is only relatable to those with a personal investment in gay rights. ""Milk"" is a worthwhile film for anyone and is worthy of its Best Picture Oscar nomination.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"powerful,thought provoking,and important","talk about a powerful film.the subject matter is quite controversial,even today:gay rights.the film takes place 30 plus years ago,and illustrates the attitudes people had back then and which some people still do today.Sean Penn plays the title character Harvey Milk.Penn,along with James Franco and Diego Luna put in very strong pivotal performances,and really show just how great they are as actors to portray a gay person as convincingly as they did,and then move on to other projects,and play a totally different character just as convincingly.the rest of the supporting is also very good.if this film, doesn't engage you and get you thinking,i'd be very surprised.it got my blood boiling a couple of times.it is based on a true story,and there is actual footage from that period used in the film.for me,Milk is 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

The true test of sharing liberty...,"Not so in the culture at large. Fear and ignorance are still in the driver's seat and the ""by golly, these gay people aren't even human"" sentiment yet thrives. The movie Milk traces the life and political career of Harvey Milk who is 'different' because of his homosexuality. The opening stillframes show police operations against homosexuals—predominantly in the club scene—in major cities of the United States in the 1950s and 60s. ""Did we really arrest people for homosexuality in those days?"" I say to myself.

Brilliant & thoughtful.....,"A continuation of Gus Van Sant's series of films with subjects around fatal shootings. This one is covering a period of time when gay men organised politically to gain greater acknowledgement from those living around them and how this lead to the first openly gay official becoming elected in the United States of America.This film shows with clarity, the pain and suffering caused by standing for office and doesn't make the main protagonist out to be any kind of saint... very refreshing.The actors, of all gender and sexuality roles portray their humanity well and don't shy from complexity.The camera work is fine and if you get the chance this film works very well on the big screen.Gus Van Sant is more than able to handle the structure of the narrative, which does maintain Penn/Milk's engaging central role throughout the film.I can't criticise Sean Penn in this movie, he brings life back to Harvey Milk, and his performance allows the audience to fully engage with Harvey even though we're preparing for the inevitably tragic end.This film does take it's time to appreciate Harvey Milk and all those around him, being a tribute with out emotional manipulation or schmaltz. I would have liked to know Harvey Milk. Living in hamlet in the UK, I never heard his message of hope when I was young, I do remember his death being reported as a young man. This film brought me his message of hope, anger and a willingness to accept change, even force it when needed.In these days the politics of hope are refreshingly brought to the fore in this film. Let's hope that this work will help to dispel any undeserved cynicism about some activists motivation.Overall I found this film a real joy, despite the painful journey, plenty of tears and my need to have a resolution I knew impossible as Milk dies too young.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Blown Away,I had not heard of this movie before and was recommended it by a friend and knowing nothing about Milk or what happened in America with gay rights I was blown away with this.

solid biopic with superb Sean Penn performance,"In 60's San Francisco, the police are cracking down on gay men. In 1970 NYC, Harvey Milk (Sean Penn) hooks up with Scott Smith (James Franco) but he's still on the down-lo. In 1972, they decide to go to San Francisco to start anew. They find an economically-depressed Haight. Harvey opens a camera shop and becomes an organizer on Castro Street. He gathers gay support and businesses supporting gays. He meets young Phoenix teen Cleve Jones (Emile Hirsch) who dismisses Harvey at first. He runs for office but fails. Anita Bryant is on a country-wide crusade against homosexuals. In 1977, there is redistricting and Harvey runs for one of the supervisors with Anne Kronenberg (Alison Pill) as his campaign manager. He starts going out with Jack Lira (Diego Luna). He finally wins as one of the first openly gay politician. In 1978, he is put in office along with opponent Dan White (Josh Brolin) from the conservative Irish Catholic district and supportive Mayor Moscone (Victor Garber). It's a tumultuous year that ends in tragedy.Director Gus Van Sant keeps this biopic along the straight and narrow following a standard biopic formula. Certainly, Harvey Milk's life has a lot of sign posts to observe. Through it all, Sean Penn gives the character a caring humanity. The large cast is populated by great actors. I would have liked more from some of these supporting characters but the story has to keep moving. Overall, this is a solid biopic.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The rare biopic that stays with you.,"I hadn't seen this film in at least two years and I forgot just how much it moves me. Gus Van Sant performs a miracle here and brings so much life and originality to a genre that is anything but lively. The biopic has become this stuffy, dull exercise of getting great actors and locking them into a boring, mundane structure where we just watch a history lesson basically and then they get lauded with awards for it. Which is whatever because some of the performances deserve them, but the films themselves are just so tired and weak and you know exactly what you're getting into. Van Sant though creates something that I don't think we had ever seen before and the film in a lot of ways is the perfect representation of the man himself.It is charming, comedic, uplifting and at times heartbreaking, but it always, always filled with two things; heart and hope. Those two things drive this film and I'm amazed still at how well Van Sant and Sean Penn manage to achieve them here. Penn was always an actor I'd admired for his brooding, emotional portrayals of broken men, but here he breaks his own mold and does something that I absolutely never thought he was capable of. He's unrecognizable, digging so deep into this character that I totally forget it's even him. I love his work in Mystic River, but this blows everything else he's done out of the water as far as I'm concerned.I also think that I really used to underrate Josh Brolin's performance here. When I first saw the film I thought the character was very under-written and while he was good, I thought he was the weak link in the supporting cast and that his Oscar nomination for it was just a sort of ""great couple of years"" nomination after he blew up in 2007. This time around though I was incredibly moved by his portrayal, turning what could have been the real villain of the piece into a complex and flawed person. It could have been very straight-forward, but Brolin added a world of depth to him and made this guy a human being.I don't think he ever tries to justify Dan White's actions, but there's a huge difference between justification and understanding and I think Brolin does a tremendous job of getting the audience to understand Dan White and understand how someone could get to a place where he commits such a heinous, unforgivable action. Brolin's portrayal is one of great anguish and while I still think the character is under-written, the actor is able to get us into understand this guy who is humiliated and pushed in a corner of self-hate and shame. It's really moving stuff.I really hate when people call films a ""triumph of the human spirit"", but this is the one film where I think I might actually apply that silly phrase. It's really the only time where after a film finishes I've wanted to get out and make a stand. Because that's what Van Sant is able to achieve here; he doesn't let you be a spectator anymore, he makes you a part of this movement. Through the incredibly unique and marvelous technical qualities of the film, from the cinematography to the score, Van Sant strips away the sentimental melodrama that usually accompanies this kind of thing and just puts you right in the movement.The big speeches are awkward (intentionally and brilliantly) and rushed and they are shot from within the crowd, not as these huge moments of technical glory with a booming score to bring the tears out. The score is utilized in the day-to-day scenes to push you through to the emotional moments that still manage to bring a tear to my eye. Penn and Van Sant do something incredible here and I think this is a real achievement in every way. The only film of the 2008 Best Picture nominees that I think deserved to be there and one of the absolute best of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good Study Of A Maverick Character,"Sean Penn's interpretation of real-life politician Harvey Milk is spot on. His completely convincing role as a gay man, a politically active one at that, again shows the remarkable actor capable of seemingly anything. But there is a bit of a letdown, to me, about this new film.I say new because a documentary has already been about Milk (The Times of Harvey Milk, 1984), and that detracts a bit from the novelty of this work. And if you read a little about the earlier movie you will find that it was very good - 3 and a half stars from Roger Ebert alone (so you know it had to be at least pretty good!). If I would have known this story had already been covered, I would not have seen it. Remakes are almost always a bad idea. There are new ideas promulgated in Hollywood every week.This movie follows most closely Harvey Milk's years in San Francisco. He didn't arrive there until fairly late in life - he was 42. Within a short period of time he became totally immersed in city politics. His story is certainly unique in that he flaunted his gayness in a time when that was unheard of, and he tilted at seemingly every political windmill he saw.I leave it to you to follow his story, from local businessman - he bought a camera shop on Castro - to elected official, serving in City Hall. And we do see a bit of the personal side of Milk; he had a series of relationships over the years, and his last one was marked by tragedy.The movie does convey some of the energy of the times, and of Milk himself; late night sessions with his colleagues, making speeches on soapboxes, pressing City Hall on an unending stream of concerns. It is intriguing how the gay community grew in power in San Francisco, and Harvey Milk was part of that renaissance.It was at City Hall where he met his fate at the hands of fellow Supervisor Dan White - played well by Josh Brolin. Although I cannot see the reason for the Best Supporting Actor nomination Brolin received; his part is not particularly lengthy nor could it not have been done as well by another.This is a three star movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pure Gold!!,"Harvey Milk returns to life through Sean Penn in a performance driven by the passion of an excellent actor. Not only was Sean Penn perfect but all involved were perfect. Milk ticks all the boxes of a amazing movie. Milk is inspiring, funny, intense, emotional, heartbreaking and it continues to be all these things but never goes over the top.I had never heard of Harvey Milk. But then i heard of a movie called Milk. I thought it was about milk. But then i looked into it and saw that it was based on the life of the gay rights activist Harvey Milk. I'm not gay or anything but after watching this i was inspired and truly saw that Harvey Milk was a great person. Rest in Peace.There is not one bad thing i can say about the acting. Penn was Great, Brolin was excellent and Franco was great. The supporting cast was all great also.As soon as the movie begins we are hit with some history of gays in the 50's and 60's and Dianne Feinstein's heartbreaking and chilling announcement of 2 deaths in office. Throughout the film we see Milk recording his will on a tape recorder. Even though this was not a intentional sad moment it still was mildly heartbreaking.I highly recommend Milk. It is the must see of 08. Maybe even more must see then The Dark Knight. It is in my top 3 of 2008. Milk was not sour milk at all. I give Milk......10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sean Penn in the performance of a lifetime,"While there are many outstanding actors and actresses out there who give brilliant performances, we often see them as an actor portraying (however well) a character. It is the mark of a truly gifted actor to see them only as their character, and not as an actor portraying them. While this is a difficult feat for an unknown actor to accomplish, it is much more so for a well-known actor because everyone knows their face from their past roles.The reason why I bring this up is so I can truly explain how good Sean Penn is in ""Milk."" Penn completely inhabits the character's shoes, and even though Penn's face is well-known, we only see Harvey Milk on-screen, not Sean Penn portraying Harvey Milk. Penn's second Oscar was well deserved. Sean Penn is an electrifying actor, but this is his best performance. In fact, this is one of the best performances by an actor that I have ever seen.""Milk"" details the life and times of Harvey Milk, the first openly gay elected official. Save for a little background, the film concentrates solely on Milk's political career, one that was cut too short by an assassination by Dan White, who was a fellow supervisor (up until a few days before the murders).The film focuses on the character of Harvey Milk, and through this exploration, we follow him through his career. The story of Milk's campaigning and occupation as the supervisor is not shortchanged, but the film is about the man. Milk was more of an activist than a politician. He never did things by the book. He saw what needed to be done, and he did it. He knew how to attract attention to his cause, and he took advantage of that repeatedly. Strangely, though, Milk became as much of a politician as anyone else, although he still worked in the same fashion.Penn is surrounded by a number of capable actors: James Franco, Diego Luna, Emile Hirsch, Josh Brolin, Alison Pill. All give solid performances, but all of them fade into the background against Penn. Josh Brolin was nominated for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as Dan White. While Brolin is always credible, he seems a little too restrained. Of the bunch, newcomer Alison Pill fares the best. It's a bit part, but Pill is very good as the lesbian Anne Kronenberg. Milk has the passion, but Anne has the smarts for getting his ideas to work.""Milk"" requires that the viewer pay attention. Dustin Lance Black's Oscar-winning script is dense, and it is very possible for a person to miss something if they are not paying attention. That being said, this is no ""Michael Clayton:"" you don't have to be a Rhodes Scholar to understand it.Gus Van Sant has never been a director to play it safe. Van Sant does what he wants, and even in his ""mainstream"" efforts, he could care less about what is commercially accessible. If it works, he'll use it. When it works, it's brilliant. First and most noticeably is his use of archive footage in the film. This is a tremendously effective approach to the work, and the technique is very well done; often times it is difficult to tell what is archive footage and what is not.One thing I especially liked about ""Milk"" is how it doesn't see its characters as stereotypes. Gays are not presented as effeminate or socially awkward. They are normal people and for once, Hollywood had the sense to not reinforce stereotypes.Unfortunately, there are too many little problems here and there that prevent me from giving this film a 10. It's the little things, like one scene is slightly confusing, a certain transition doesn't work, and so on. The ending is meant to be very powerful and dramatic, but the film needed more focus on the story of Harvey Milk's career for that to have been as effective as Van Sant surely wanted it to be.Still, ""Milk"" is highly recommended. Gay, straight, bisexual, homophobic or not, ""Milk"" is highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Got Rights?,"Life really did begin at 40 for Harvey Milk.Unfortunately, it ended at 48.MILK follows the short, comet-across-the-skies career of Harvey Milk (Sean Penn), the first gay official elected to public office in the Close-minded United Hypocrite States of America.We meet Milk in the waning hours of his 39th birthday, picking up a stranger (James Franco as Scott Smith). Breakneck pacing, we see the new couple open a camera store in San Francisco's Castro Street, a gay-tolerant neighborhood with the odd dissenter doing the usual ""Man's Law and God's Law"" rant.Milk, who gave good megaphone, came of age in an era when police clashes with homosexuals was at its height, the late 60s.Through a series of homophobic public incidents, the bearded and pony-tailed Milk finds his life's calling in his early 40s, as a gay community activist - the self-proclaimed ""Mayor of Castro Street."" After realizing his popularity in a local election, which he loses, he eschews the Haight-Ashbury look for the clean-shaven, three-piece suit, white-collar criminal look.And is elected San Francisco City Supervisor in 1978.Milk constantly butts heads with fellow politician, Dan White (Josh Brolin) over gay rights, leading us to believe that White is either Republican or secretly wants to tap Milk's ass.After Scott Smith has enough of the megaphoning and politics and leaves Milk, Jack Lira (Diego Luna) becomes Milk's high maintenance bitch.Emil Hirsch (who Penn directed in INTO THE WILD, 2007) is Cleve Jones, a high-level organizer and seemingly Milk's successor to the megaphone.Milk's major success stories are crammed into montages - boycotting Coors, stepping in dogshit (uh, passing a law to clean up after dogs) and passing a gay rights bill, as well as constantly campaigning for gay rights against the close-minded douchebags in power.Affecting the local politics, the national voice: singer and god-whore, Anita Bryant leads a startlingly-white organized campaign against homosexuality, claiming she can't read the bible with gays around. Not surprisingly, America listens.Eventually, Dan White can't keep it in his pants any longer and, using a gun in lieu of a dick, pumps Milk full of hot lead.Harvey Milk (1930-1978).No compelling reasons are shown on how White the Politician tipped into the frame of mind to become White the Assassin - guess every politician is a latent felon. I'm sure we're all in agreement. White would be released after five years in prison, on ""the Twinkie Defense,"" his lawyers arguing that overeating junk food made him premeditate murder.Makes you wanna shoot someone, doesn't it?Sean Penn loses himself completely in the character of Harvey Milk; from his body language to his speech inflections, his gaiety is flawless, and we cannot see one trace of the barnstorming politician and roaring public speaker he played as Huey Long in ALL THE KING'S MEN (2006). Matter of fact, the performances of all these straight men is invisible - they do not over-fruit it, yet give every indication they crave meat in the seat. In 2009, after the lauded BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN (2005) audiences won't stand for anything less.Ironically, I suspect that from this point, there will be less tolerance for ""brave"" yet timid films like PHILADELPHIA (1993), which brought the issue of homosexual AIDS into A-List cinema (ten years too late, I might add), yet with nil chemistry and minimal necking between the gay leading man and his lover (Tom Hanks and Antonio Banderas).In MILK, it is heartening to see a film where men kissing seems as natural and emotionally satisfying as seeing any hetero couple making out. These actors are so committed, we never question how challenging it might have been for them to imbue their intimate moments with such passion.Jerry Falwell spinning in his septic grave.All ""serious"" films about gay rights in America seem to be regarded by straight tolerant people and the gay community with the same sanctity that anti-gay fundamentalists regard holy writ against homosexuality. Truthfully, there should be nothing special about these movies - or about these people, as brave as they might have been. All those protests and riots that America endured during the 60s and 70s does not reflect the braveness of the rioters or the dissenters, as much as the ignorance of American society. It needed to be told truths already outlined in its Constitution, yet that were obscured by malefactors; it needed to be wounded by its own kind to heal itself.As politicians have realized in 2009, ""gay"" is now only an issue with voters over thirty. A new breed of hippie (as in ""hip"") has been birthed, a new movement of dissenters and anti-authoritarians who couldn't give a Brokeback Mountain over whether people are gay or straight or anywhere in between.They're called kids - ironically, the demographic that anti-gay people are trying to protect from gays. In reality, they're trying to protect THEMSELVES from the kids who are going to vote them out of power some day. That day cannot come soon enough...The world is becoming smoother and rounder - like a gay guy after an exhilarating body-shave - not so much because tolerance is being learned, but because IN-tolerance is being taught less.Milk saw something deeper than ephemeral personal gain in holding political office, ""I'm not a candidate. I'm part of a movement. The Movement is the candidate."" Lesson learned. Apply to wound.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sean Penn Is God!,"Gus Van Sant's 'Milk' is a very good and honest film. A film that being a Biopic isn't boring. The film shows the political side of the late congressman Harvey Milk. Leaving aside too many gay kissing scenes, It is a very well made/written film is all respects.'Milk' works and only works because of Sean Penn. He got the Oscar award recently for Best Actor, and he deserved ever bit of it. He's outstanding. Honestly, words fail to speak about his portrayal.

Good for people younger than those who actually had to live through the 70s,"All people younger than 45 need to watch this movie and remember Harvey Milk and especially his boyfriend Scott Smith, who died of HIV complications in 1995. Too bad that people do not remember Smith as well as Milk. In the US we have a very short historical memory, and most do not even remember Milk. Sean Penn and James Franco look much more attractive than the two men they embody, and that is a good thing, because the movie is sad. Hard to take for those like myself, who had to live through the late 70s as gay youngsters and then through the 80s with friends dying of strange diseases. Had this historical piece been less than 2 hours long, I would have given it a 10. But the thing went on for almost two and half hours and it was sad, very sad.

"For Once, the Academy Got It Right","My wife and I did not particularly enjoy ""Milk"" as we expected to, though Sean Penn is letter perfect as Harvey Milk, and Josh Brolin does a good job as Dan White, the Supervisor who kills Milk and Mayor George Moscone (Victor Garber). Perhaps it's because we knew the story, having lived through it, and that deprived it of narrative surprise.Perhaps it's because of what's missing. While Milk's crew of young supporters, especially Alison Pill as Anne Kronenberg and Emile Hirsch as Cleve Jones, come through as intended, there's no real exploration of the tactics that enabled Milk to cobble together a majority from the Castro and the Haight Ashbury communities that formed his district. We learn about the Castro, but Haight Ashbury might as well be the other side of the moon for all the illumination that the script and director Gus van Sant provide.The subplot involving Milk and his two lovers is not particularly engrossing and the suicide of the needy Diego Luna (Jack Lira), the second of the two, is curiously irrelevant and unmoving. If it weren't for Penn's performance, this film would likely be classified as a dud.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great performances only strengthen an already powerful film,"There is something inherently wonderful in Gus Van Sant's Milk. Besides telling the mostly true story of openly gay San Francisco politician Harvey Milk (Sean Penn), the film acts as a gay rights, and more importantly, human rights, piece that feels all too appropriate for the times.Leaving aside the homosexual bigotry we still face in 2009, it may be all too easy to see this as just another way of the Academy reaching out after the horrendous snubbing of Brokeback Mountain three years ago. That assumption is all too wrong.Milk stands on its own as a great film. Interweaving Milk's years running for political office alongside his own recording of a final will and testament, the film employs a fairly constant narrative structure of connecting the film's footage with stock footage from the actual events. In some cases, it may even be hard to tell the difference (save for some scenes where the stock footage looks blatantly worn down and grainy). It has been done many times before, but it works especially well for this film. It brings a much needed sense of realism to the film, and an even better sense of authenticity. You would never guess that the majority of these actors were even alive in the 1970s.Van Sant expertly uses Dustin Lance Black's original screenplay to weave the tale of Milk's final years living in San Francisco. We only learn vague notions of what his life was like before he met Scott Smith (James Franco) on his fortieth birthday. And while it may have helped flesh out Milk's backstory, the film succeeds without it. We learn enough about the man and what he did for the gay rights movement in 1970s America to appreciate and know who he was. The little tidbits we find out later on only cement the obvious feeling we get.And Penn, whose work I very rarely enjoy, breathes a fascinating amount of life into Milk. Penn puts his heart into the role, and really plays this one from down deep. You can see the hurt in his eyes, and the awe-inspiring joy. His body expressions say more than enough; with a simple twitch in his mouth, he can rather easily change the character's entire construct. He makes the acting look so easy, but I would be hardset not believing the real man acted in a similar way. While I think Frank Langella will ultimately win the Oscar, this is Penn's strongest work in over a decade (especially more so than that overrated Oscar-winning turn in Mystic River). His visual transformation into this inspirational individual is nothing short of amazing.Van Sant also succeeds in his use of love in the film. There are a few steamy homosexual scenes featuring Penn (none to the point of Brokeback), but they are all filmed so passionately and delicately that they look visually beautiful. In fact, the majority of this visually laden film is captured rather beautifully. Although it seems like there is particular emphasis on reflections and juxtaposition, there are some unique angles from crowd settings that help encourage the authenticity of the film even further.Josh Brolin delivers a startling performance as Dan White. If you have read anything about Milk, then you obviously know why he is so important to the story. But Brolin downplays the character for the majority of his time on screen (albeit, his first appearance comes halfway into the film). He practically quivers under Penn's shoes. But when he finally gets his moment to start chewing scenery, Brolin delivers in spades. He practically lets loose, showing off the excellent chops put to fine use in the underrated W. and No Country for Old Men. He too, plays a lot of his performance with his facial expression, and at times, he does not even need to say a word. We can just tell exactly what is going on. The man knows exactly what buttons to push to get a reaction.Franco, Emile Hirsch (Penn's leading man in the criminally snubbed Into the Wild) and Diego Luna all give fine performances in their roles. While I think Luna could have toned himself back a bit, I think Franco could have brought himself a little further. He too is quite important to the film, but he feels a bit too downplayed. I would have liked to see him do a bit more. Hirsch gets his moments, few and far between, and does a great job. He too could have done a bit more however, but nevertheless, his is a standout performance.If there are any problems, it is the fact that the film stretches itself a little too far as it nears the final act. It was not boring to the point of aping the sleep-inducing The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, but it was not exactly being very interesting either. I realize what is being shown is important and a lot of it thought-provokingly emotional, but there was about twenty minutes that could have easily been trimmed right down. It really feels like it is going the distance, but falters on the way there.It took a while, but it was well worth seeing Milk. Van Sant has helped craft a great piece of film-making that will surely not fade away anytime soon. While it is not clear how much of Black's screenplay is original and how much is real, the man clearly has talent and can only continue to go up from here.Milk may not be the best of the year, but it is surely among the ranks. Even if you are not gay, the film still provokes an immediate reaction I doubt will leave me. This is powerful stuff, and exactly what this film-making medium should be striving for more often. I can only wish more films will follow its example.8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Amazing & Important,"Milk is a Fabulous film.in every way. trough it's photography and coloring...it takes us right back to the optimistic era in the 70-ies in which we find ourselves in San Fransisco in the gay-rights-activists scene off-which Harvey Milk was the Motor.

Brilliant Portrayal by Sean Penn,"And Gus Van Sant is to be commended on his remarkable direction.I'm one who saw the documentary on Harvey Milk several years ago and it has stayed with me. I didn't expect this film to enhance my experience of the documentary, but it did, much to my surprise.Penn's performance is nothing short of stunning. He literally channels Harvey, by gesture and speech but most of all by the ever present smile. Harvey, as portrayed in the original documentary had a boundless joie de vivre and an irrepressible sense of self and a conviction of his own role in making history. Sean nails this.The film uses a series of short and sharp vignettes to tell the story of Harvey's life after his 40th birthday, his attempts to get election three times and his relationships.If there was any fault to find in the film it was in the occasional continuity lapses (one involving a dog that was severe enough to jerk me out of the film) and the sometimes irritating camera angles and muffled sound quality. Another was the dearth of visible homosexual women who were quite prominent in this era of the seventies.But on the whole, I found Harvey's romantic love stories believable and his personal charm captivating.Kudos to Sean Penn particularly and to the supporting cast of Josh Brolin, as the possibly closeted and mentally ill Dan White. Diego Luna, Joseph Cross and Emile Hirsch are also great but James Franco is a knockout as the one, great, romantic love interest at the root of Harvey's life.8 out of 10.

Good Milk!,"Got Milk? Unfortunately, we don't got milk anymore in the form of 70's San Francisco gay rights leader/elected official Supervisor Harvey Milk. He was assassinated along with then San Francisco Mayor George Moscone in 1978 by a former S.F. Supervisor Dan White. Director Gus Van Sant's ""Milk"" biographical diary film product turns out to be one of the emotional cinematic rousers of the year. Sean Penn milked it through with his performance as Harvey Milk; it is another ""Pennmanship"" acting showstopper which should garner him a Best Actor Academy Award nomination. Josh Brolin goes from effectively playing a Bushman (Anti-Gay) White in ""W."" as President Bush to effectively playing another Bushman (Anti-Gay) White as Dan White. Brolin continues to broil it up with his recent paramount acting performances. Oh Josh! This might be your Oscar year! James Franco gives a frank and tender performance as Milk's longtime lover and campaign manager Scott Smith, and Emile Hirsh is the Emile acting ticket again by charismatically portraying an ""into the wild"" Milk campaign apprentice called Cleve Jones. Openly gay Director Gus Van Sant constructively marches to the beat of his own drum by helming a profoundly inspirational narrative of Harvey Milk, the first openly gay person ever elected to political office. Milk's mission was not just about gay rights but about civil rights. So I think the Academy should be civil enough to consider Van Sant as a Best Director Oscar nominee. Van Sant's stock package of actual footage from the Milk era was an imperative ingredient to his ""Milk"". Dustin Lance Black's rookie screenplay of ""Milk"" was a verbal juggernaut achievement in civil rights literacy. The ""Milk Chronicles"" travel from Harvey's New York underachieving life to his resilient triumph to political candidacy in San Francisco to his tragic assassination in City Hall by White, and every Milk life drop in between. My only sour milk taste for ""Milk"" was the just one too many ""rah rah"" rally scenes. Nevertheless, ""Milk"" was up to par within my cinematic taste. It is time for you to be ""Under the Milky Way"" tonight and cinematically drink up a viewing of ""Milk"". **** Good",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Stunning Biography,"Milk is one of the best films of the year and is a safe bet to make an appearance at this year's Oscar contest with Sean Penn almost locked into the favorite role for Best Actor. The film focuses on the gay rights movement in San Francisco in the 1970's and what could have easily boiled down to tired rhetoric is actually quite uplifting and entertaining.The film's framing device (harvey Milk predicting his own death in a taped interview with himself) is actually a pretty good way to plot out the story line beginning with Milk's arrival in SF and his meeting up with his long time lover (James Franco). The relationship between them is quite accurately observed. Those with an open mind will realize that these are the pitfalls inherent in any long term relationship, gay or straight. Another great performance is delivered by Josh Brolin as Dan White, the council member who finally cracked and whose attorneys came up with the infamous ""twinkie defense"".You don't have to be a liberal activist to enjoy Milk. Penn's performance infuses such humanity in the lead that the picture transcends many of the limitations of the biopic genre and makes for quite rousing entertainment regardless of your preconceptions.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
And the Oscar goes to.....Sean Penn.,"I've seen most of the contenders but at the moment, I am deliriously  high on the on-screen Harvey Milk -- Sean Penn. I had just deemed Frank  Langella my best actor pick until I found myself mesmerized by Penn for  the entire two plus hour film.  Milk is a fine movie in and of itself. A wonderful tapestry of  political statement woven through a sweet love story. Harvey Milk was a  force whose wits were enhanced by a little chutzpah, or maybe a lot of  chutzpah, propelling him to get things done (an understatement). Armed  with his compassionate heart he was/is a gay man's champion and an icon  to his community. In his political struggle, he sacrificed his most  cherished relationship for his bigger picture mission to dignify the  gay community and lead them in reclaiming its civil rights.  The story is hopeful. It's heroic and touching. But the hero of the two  hour masterpiece is Sean Penn. I can't remember a film where he was  this good. I've always admired him as an actor but I was never over the  moon for him until now.  Like classic chameleon, Streep, Penn disappeared into Milk. He brought  depth to the character that transcends the standard of ""great acting"".  As Slumdog Millionaire created a new movie standard category, Penn went  beyond the normally impressive bounds of acting.  Penn was Harvey Milk. Dare I say it? Is channeling too eerie a word to  use or is that actually another synonym for good acting? I don't know.  Frank Langella. I still adore your Nixon. It amazed me at how this  handsome actor morphed into a despicable Nixon. Even though his body  language was superb, his posture precise, Langella really did make  Nixon a lot prettier than he was in real life. If you see nothing else,  see Frost/Nixon and Milk just to see the tremendous competition for  best actor. Oh, of course you've already seen Slumdog, right? That  movie is so far off the charts that none of the others compare, even  the best ones.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good But Not Great,"Gus Van Sant's rock-solid account of the rise of San Francisco politician Harvey Milk and his efforts to bring awareness to gay-rights issues is supremely capable and engaging, but there was something about the whole thing that just felt a bit uninspired to me.I knew absolutely nothing about Milk's story before seeing the film -- I was all of three when Milk was assassinated -- so I was very interested in it from a historical perspective. However, I just didn't connect to it on an emotional level. I'm not sure why, because I'm a chump for a good old fashioned underdog story -- which ""Milk"" certainly is. And there's almost nothing negative I can say about the film that accounts for my lukewarm reaction to it. Sometimes there's just an intangible ""something"" missing from a film that prevents me from responding much to it, and that's the case here.It does boast a tremendous performance from Sean Penn though, completely lacking in the hamminess Penn has been guilty of in his more recent film appearances. He unfussily gets down to the business of playing the character of Harvey Milk without self-concsiously reminding us that he's Sean Penn playing him. Weirdly, despite Milk being such a flamboyant character, Penn's performance is unshowy. Of the supporting cast, I was most impressed with Emile Hirsch, who plays a member of Milk's campaign committee. Hirsch contributes a great deal of energy to the film whenever he's on screen, and the scenes featuring him and Penn together are some of the movie's best.For once, I didn't like a Danny Elfman score. It's too obtrusive and is at odds with Van Sant's typically objective style. But other than that, I thought the film was extremely well done.My comment may have already made this apparent, but I'm rather puzzled at my own reaction to the film. Instead of being able to give it an enthusiastic endorsement, I rather thought that it was a good but not great 2008 offering.Grade: A",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sean Penn and Gus Van Sant at their finest.,"I honestly don't know where to begin.This is by far the best male ensemble cast, and one of the best ensemble casts in years. Sean Penn is outstanding as Harvey Milk, becoming the character in full, and unrelentingly motions up and down the emotional spectrum.James Franco is great supporting throughout the movie. I personally feel as though the golden globe nom should have been for this as opposed to Pineapple Express, which he also did quite well in I might add.Emile Hirsch is outstandingly entertaining, with a very feminine ""prick"" like demeanor.Diego Luna is equally funny, and manages to play slightly on edge from the first scene he's in, pretty damn well.I think this is Gus Van Sant's finest direction. Either the set design, or the way Van Sant manipulated it, was the finest I've seen in quite some time.

"History is Beautifully Portrayed by a Superb Cast,","Milk is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. History is truly brought to life in this film, all the actors put their heart and sole in to these performances, Senn Penn truly becomes Harvey Milk, he is nothing like himself as he has completely devoted himself to this character, and he certainly deserved his second Academy Award win for this. I didn't particularly like how it showed actual footage of Harvey Milk throughout, It was up to Penn to convince the audience that he is Milk, so I didn't think it was necessary the show the real man, it simply took me away from his performance. The struggles for gay rights back in the seventies are superbly captured in this, it conveys a clear sense of how difficult this really was and how some people were strong enough to keep fighting. Stunning performances and an uplifting true story, I would recommend Milk to anyone looking for a good biography film or drama.Follows the story of Harvey Milk as he fights for the rights of gay people and soon becomes the first openly gay official in Califronia.Best Performance: Sean Penn",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Nutshell Review: Milk,"Biopics work for me because I'm innately curious about that aspect of a person's life which makes it compelling enough for others to want to make a film out of it. This film by Gus Van Sant tells the story of California's first openly gay elected official Harrvey Milk over the span of the last 8 and definitely more fruitful years of his life where he discovers his calling ironically after confessing to a lover that he had so far not done anything constructive with his, and then with their subsequent move to San Franscisco.Milk is one of the films this year up for a number of accolades, more notably for Sean Penn's nuanced performance as Harvey Milk. I thought he had, with the help of make up, totally disappeared into the role, and gave it his all as the soft spoken, and idealistic political rookie who had to take on the big boys, as well as deep rooted bigotry and prejudice. And not only that, he has to contend with keeping his partner Scott Smith (James Franco) emotionally satisfied, since it's no longer a private world of their own, but one which faced the tussle of precious time as he finds it his calling to take up political office. I felt that while Franco has to date played plenty of pretty boy action roles, here he ramps up his dramatic performance opposite veteran Sean Penn, and managed to hold his own too.Not only that, the ensemble cast here had been top notch, and that's not only just kudos to the make up team in having them resemble their real life counterparts to a T. Josh Brolin as Dan White always had this unpredictable edge to him, and his involvement in the inevitable finale was nothing short of chilling to witness. Emile Hirsch as Cleve Jones plays one of Harvey's key assistants, and his role here was quite endearing, despite being only in a supporting capacity.Watching this film, you can't help but to appreciate just how long the USA took to change its perception and acceptance of the GLBT community. It takes relentless, continuous effort to effect change from within the political system through a very charismatic personality supported by his own grassroots. As the saying goes, change is the only constant and is inevitable, and one of the strategies undertaken here was to come out of the closet, so that friends and family could demolish the stigma of demonizing those who are queer and come to accept them, since after all, they could be immediate friends and family. This I thought was a smart move since it almost does away with negative perception and destructive assumptions, though it calls for a very stout heart for anyone to reveal who they truly are.Gus Van Sant had wonderfully mixed the filmed narrative with real archival footages to add that sense of realism to this biopic. He doesn't paint that pitch perfect portrait of Harvey Milk, and provided a sense of balance in that it does take whatever method that works to try and drum up support for their movement. Which I thought had echoed that plenty of successful ideologies thrive, not because what persists is that charismatic representative, but that of the doctrine that people subscribe to.And collectively and persistently, change can be effected. There's nothing too fancy about the way Harvey Milk's life got presented here, but it delivered where it mattered in having a solid narrative to illustrate the life of a man who's in pursuit to eradicate negative mindsets and the deeply harboured prejudice of man. The homosexual subject matter may be central here to the cause, but put aside, the same struggles and challenges to overcome are universal conditions that everyone will go through at one point or another. A highly recommended movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""My name is Seth Wehner and I'm here to review you""","Milk- one of Sean Penn's greatest performances ever. Everything in this movie had something everyone liked, unless you hate gay people. I find Milk interesting because it was the time after the Civil Rights Movement and people thought that everyone loved each other, but there was still an out casted group of people; homosexuals. Harvey Milk was the MLK of homosexuals and this movie addresses that greatly. Penn does a great job acting as a gay person as did a retarded person in I Am Sam, but you could really feel that he was Harvey Milk even if you never heard of Harvey Milk. Penn definitely deserved the Oscar. The entire cast did a great job helping out from James Franco, Josh Brolin, Emile Hirsch and company, but Sean Penn stole the show. If you are someone who hates gay people then you might want to see Milk just to see how gay people were living through back then and how it is applied now. Milk was great in almost all aspects in directing, writing, and acting. MIlk is definitely worth watching.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
If only more directors of today had Gus Van Sant's courage and vision...,"The story of Harvey Milk is one that very few are aware of, but it is arguably one of the most important and controversial stories in the recent History of the United States. Gus Van Sant successfully and competently brings the story of the first openly homosexual man elected to office, and does so without infusing any degree of pretension, hypocrisy, or melodrama (which would have been easy to do in a biopic of this nature). Indeed, viewers are treated to a smart, emotional, and historically-accurate portrayal of one of the most influential characters in the history of the Human Rights Movement. The story is supported by numerous historical/archival clips dealing with, and related to the key incidents of the story.The ensemble is impeccably cast, with Sean Penn in perhaps his best bit of acting following MYSTIC RIVER. Again, Penn avoids the expected pretentiousness and melodrama that a role like this may entail, to excellent effect. The nomination for Best Lead Actor was well-warranted, and may very well result in a victory. Josh Brolin's nomination for Best Supporting Actor was equally well-warranted, as he does more in his expressions and mannerisms to portray his character's dilemmas and tribulations than many of today's actors can. Emile Hirsch and James Franco are equally impressive.The screenplay (written directly for the screen), direction, and cinematography are quite excellent, and serve to make this technically one of the best films of 2008. It is no surprise that MILK was nominated for Best Picture, thought the controversial subject matter, coupled with a strong field may well prevent it from achieving ultimate victory. It is also my fear that IMDb ratings and box-office numbers will falter due to the raw subject matter.9/10. 4 stars (out of 4). Will enter my Top 150 at 148.

Milk (2008),"Going through Harvey Milk's story was sad but extremely inspirational and looking at what people said about him, he seemed like the most lovable guy in the world. He was funny, charming, and just a wonderful person to be around, it was extremely sad to find out how his life ended and over something so stupid. Milk was made with great taste and Sean Penn delivers the performance of a lifetime playing Harvey Milk Unsatisfied with his life and in need of a change, Harvey Milk decides to move to San Francisco with his boyfriend in hoping of a better acceptance. They open Castro Camera in the heart of Eureka Valley, a working class neighborhood in the process of evolving into a predominantly gay neighborhood known as The Castro. Frustrated by the opposition they encounter in the once Irish-Catholic neighborhood, Milk utilizes his background as a businessman to become a gay activist, eventually becoming a mentor for Cleve Jones. After two unsuccessful political campaigns in 1973 and 1975 to become a city supervisor and a third in 1976 for the California State Assembly, Milk finally wins a seat on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977 for District 5. His victory makes him the first openly gay man to be voted into major public office in the United States. Milk subsequently meets fellow Supervisor Dan White, a Vietnam veteran and former police officer and firefighter. White, who is politically and socially conservative, has a difficult relationship with Milk. He faces more problems as Proposition 6 is about to be passed. It's only a matter of time until someone gets angry with Milk and decides to deal with the matter themselves. It is not all that surprising when we discover who kills Milk and Mayor George Moscone, but it is all the more thought-provoking.I highly recommend anyone to watch Milk, as the film was extremely moving and really makes you think before you say something stupid because someone else is different from you, not just sexually, but in general. It really breaks your heart to see how hard it must be for people who are different to express themselves and to be rejected by society. Sean plays Harvey with the love and compassion that the real Harvey would respect. Sean Penn's performance as Harvey could not be bettered by any actor living today, so we owe him a great debt for making this movie, and giving his heart and soul to the role. I believe it is Penn's most mature yet also most lovable role ever. I wanted the movie to go on and on, because I felt like I was actually there in San Francisco in 1978-79. Gus Van Sant recreated that world perfectly, and Sean Penn showed us the potential of this very real man with this unique ability to inspire and transform us. Van Sant and Sean Penn each earned a very special chamber in Heaven for giving us this beautiful tribute. This was a phenomenal look into politics and equality among all men, and was very inspirational and moving from the opening scene to the closing credits.My Rating -9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fight for equality,"In this biopic, Sean Penn delivers a truly standout performance as Harvey Milk. Penn captures Milk's charisma, passion, and determination perfectly, making you root for him in his fight for LGBTQ+ rights during the 1970s.The film does an excellent job not only of showcasing Milk's political journey but also of depicting the vibrant and sometimes tumultuous atmosphere of the freedom rights movement at that time. The supporting cast, including James Franco and Josh Brolin, is fantastic and adds layers to the story, especially the complexities of friendship and loyalty within the movement. Visually, the movie captures the era beautifully, with great attention to detail that immerses you in the historical context. The emotional beats hit hard, especially towards the end, as it addresses the challenges and sacrifices faced by those involved in the fight for equality.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Cannot speak to ""social significance,relevance,etc."";can only speak to the movie itself","I've sampled some of the other comments and this is another film that seems to inspire extreme opinions. While it seems to have plenty of more positive opinion,there are(naturally)going to be some WAY less than positive reviews,much of them,it seems,steeped in an adverse opinion about gays,Sean Penn,Hollywood and the media at large. I thought I'd address that because it seems like it would be rather dense and oblivious of me to ignore it.Also,I know that there is plenty to this movie that would inspire any person who just saw it to become overwhelmed by this sense of almost social,political,even spiritual revelation and inspiration,a sort of sense of benediction toward a hero or revolutionary. Since I'm not gay and my memories of HArvey Milk,Prop 8,Anita Bryant or any element of the 1970s Gay rights movements is pretty sketchy at best,I'm afraid the social significance for me personally is mostly marginal.So I,the reviewer,am basically left at examining this movie for exactly what it is: a big-budget,bio-pic during award season. As such,it largely works.The story of activist and charismatic politico HArvey Milk(Sean Penn,much less ""ACTING!"" as he is sometimes want to do)picks up as he's a freshly forty gay man leaving behind his closeted life in New Yorck City with younger lover Scott Smith(JAmes Franco,really growing as an actor!) to re-build in the economically flipped,new gay haven that was early 1970s San Francisco. First as a business man in the CAstro district,then as a charismatic,socially winsome politician-wanna-be and self-appointed ""Mayor of CAstro"",Milk becomes steadily more and more energized as a type of activist. As his popularity grows,so does his controversy,and when he's finally elected to city counsel in 1977,he quietly knows he's a marked man,yet he's still compelled to act on his convictions.The supporting cast is good,if not magnificent. Best turns seem to come from Emile Hirsch as an ambitious,""never knew he could be so passionate""gay youth and future activist Cleve Jones,Diego Luna as Milk's boyfriend during his election years,a hyper-depressed fem who threatens Milk's image constantly and Josh Brolin as DAn White,the straight-arrow rival counsel-man who's own personal conflicts regarding Milk(among other things) will create a combustive and fateful result.OPenly gay director Gus Van Sant applies much of what he's known for:jump-cuts,narrative framing and lean,mean story-telling to frame what was journalist RAndy Shilts' facts(hemmed into a script by someone whose name right now escapes me)into a largely effective story. THe movie itself mostly suffers from some fairly common elements in bio-pictures(i.e. predictable arcs,foreshadowing that is as plain as day);not bad things,really,but stuff that has little distinction over what you might easily as soon catch in documentaries or even made-for-TV movies. It also is unabashedly carrying a sense of ""agenda"";not a Liberal/Conservative type of agenda,or even a personal experience agenda,but more of a ""Great,flawed man + purity of conviction = sainthood"". Again,not terrible things in and of themselves,but they constrict the viewing of this film to something of an either a ""Soapbox"" effect or a educational effect,which can just as easily alienate as enlighten. MAybe Van Sant figured those things to be the end product,but when a show becomes as critically acclaimed as MIlk has become,it muddies the waters and forces viewers who may not have a particularly clear opinion on the issues being broached to either accept or reject his movie,rather than absorb this as a real and commendable human issue struggle story.Fantastic performances,solid soundtrack and a competent(if perhaps overly cut-and-dried)film make for not only award nominees but also fine entertainment. On that count,Milk largely succeeds.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Milk has Aged Like a Fine Vintage Wine,"Occasionally a film biography will feature a stellar performance that firmly merges the actor with the person portrayed: George C. Scott as Patton, Ben Kingsley as Gandhi, Daniel Day Lewis as Lincoln. While Gus Van Sant's 1968 film about gay-martyr Harvey Milk does not strive for the spectacle of those works, his lead, Sean Penn, joins the lofty heights of those other Oscar-winning performers and becomes forever identified with the historical personage. Penn won a well-deserved second Oscar for the role, and Dustin Lance Black also took home a statuette for his literate engrossing screenplay.Using real and recreated documentary footage as backdrop, Van Sant retells Milk's story from his melancholy 40th birthday to his assassination less than a decade later. Before he became the first openly gay person elected to public office in California, Milk felt that he had done little with his first 40 years of life and needed a change. With a good-looking boyfriend (James Franco), he heads west to San Francisco, opens a camera shop in the Castro District, and becomes a local political leader in the city's gay community. The camera shop develops into a political hangout, and, supported by an assemblage that includes Emile Hirsch, Alison Pill, and Joseph Cross, Milk makes several unsuccessful runs for a spot on the city's Board of Supervisors. Ultimately, in 1977, Milk won a fateful victory in the same election that propelled a ""family values"" champion, Dan White, well and creepily played by Josh Brolin, into office alongside him.Black's screenplay details Milk's political dances with White, sometimes harmonious, sometimes adversarial. However, the film climaxes with Harvey's greatest victory, the defeat of California's Proposition 6; championed by Anita Bryant and State Senator John Briggs, the bill would have fired all gay teachers in the state. Although knowledgeable viewers will already know the results of the referendum and the tragic end of Harvey's life, Van Sant holds interest throughout, aided immensely by Sean Penn's career-topping performance. Not content with a striking physical resemblance, Penn inhabits Milk's persona with the mannerisms, speech patterns, and body language familiar from the public Milk. Unlike the grand-scale film biographies of world leaders like Patton or Gandhi, ""Milk"" honors its modest yet heroic subject with an intimate bio-pic that does not overwhelm its core performance. Like a fine red wine, ""Milk"" has aged well, and, five years after its release, the film resonates even more as the march towards marriage equality progresses. Without heroes like Harvey Milk, the country would be a poorer place, and, thanks to Van Sant, Black, and Penn, his story and sacrifice continue to inspire.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Milk Shows Penn's Explosive Work,"What constantly pops off the screen as cinema gold in the new film Milk is the film's star Sean Penn. It is completely save to say that Sean Penn is Milk. Penn seems boundless in his depiction of Harvey Milk, who was an affable, magnetic guy, capable of picking up a longtime boyfriend with a proposition on the subway platform and attracting a cabal of young energetic men when he opened up a camera shop in San Francisco's Castro Street. As you can imagine, the neighborhood was turning to the gay side of life at the time.Gus Van Sant directs in a very stylized manner that puts a nostalgic haze over the film that Dustin Lance Black has scripted out. The film touches on being a run of the mill biopic but the driving force that moves us is Sean Penn with a little help from Emile Hirsh who leads an energetic cross section of supporters injecting youth into the cause.As with any biopic, the circumstances and those around it feel deeply about it. It would be easy for the movie to be ordinary. These characters come forward with new zeal and total commitment for these characters.

My name is Harvey Milk...,"It is my first time reviewing a movie, and I'm so excited. Of course, there are countless movies I could write about, but the first one that popped into my mind was ""Milk"". This is easily one of my favorite movies because of the overall message of it. This is a movie with an actual moral, something many other movies don't. It is telling us to stand up for what we believe in, and not to let others affect our personal beliefs. The first time I watched this movie, I was blown away. The performances by Sean Penn, James Franco, Josh Brolin, Emile Hirsch, Diego Luna, Alison Pill, etc. were brilliant and really helped the audience feel the mood of '70s San Fransisco. The second time I watched it, I began noticing the script and how the dialogue is perfect. I just about cried at the end, but you just have to watch it yourself to understand why. Well-deserved Oscars were earned for Best Actor and Best Original Screenplay that year, and if it wasn't released in the same year as ""Slumdog Millionaire"", it would've taken home Best Picture and Best Director. I feel like this is, by far, Gus Van Sant's best work, only to be rivaled by ""Good Will Hunting"".

Full of emotion,"This film had a lot of feeling behind it. It really shows a part of the world that people forget. It shows how everyone is human and everyone hurts.

He cared for people like him and others in the world who also felt this pain. Sean Penn plays Harvey Milk and he does an amazing job. This is a great story and movie, but the movie did seem to rush and that was a problem. There was just too much info about Milk that could not be shown in one movie. Also some of the cast didn't seem to fit very well. James Franco seemed a little off par for me in this film. He was OK I guess, just didn't seem like he fit the character. At the end of the film in the credits they do show pictures of the real people from this film. It was very interesting to see how many of them really looked like the actors. So overall a very touching movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A new, bright look at the world.","MILK -2008This Oscar nominee movie is a strong and powerful film about Harvey Milk, the first openly homosexual man who became elected to board office in America. We follow his journey from New York to San Francisco where he opens a Photoshop with his boyfriend Scott in the Castro area. Eventually, Castro becomes a hangout spot for gay people in San Francisco, and after some time, people from all across America travel to San Francisco to be a part of the fast growing movement that Milk is starting. In San Francisco his political career flourishes, making him one of the best gay rights fighters in human history.The director Gus Van Sant tells the story so well, and with a great respect for Milk's heritage.In the end, it is the performances from the actors that make this film worth seeing. If you know what Penn stands for, you won't get surprised. However, with this performance, he just knocks everyone off the pitch. This is, together with Daniel Day-Lewis' interpretation of Daniel Plainview in There Will be Blood, the best performance in decades. Sean Penn makes his best performance so far in his career. James Franco makes a good appearance as Scott, while Josh Brolin contributes with depth and quality as Dan White, Milk's co-worker in the Board Office. Emile Hirsch makes a surprisingly good performance as Cleve Jones, a young guy, who eventually becomes an important support for Milk and his politic view.I started watching this movie with high expectations, and I did not get disappointed. The story flows well, and in the end you just realize you have witnessed great movie-making.I recommend this movie to everyone who likes seeing a good movie; this is not ordinary Hollywood garbage. People who appreciate well written and historically accurate movies will be satisfied. This is pure filmmaking on is very best, with actors delivering in every scene. And as I mentioned, Sean Penn is marvelous, as always. He rightly deserves his first Oscar since Mystic River from 2003.Unfortunately, the fight against the rampant discrimination against and hatred of homosexuals is still not over. Milk's movement lives on, and grows stronger every day. He would be proud of that, and will be sad that our society has not truly healed, but only learned to mask its intolerance and hatred.In the end: Watch the movie, feel the power Milk created in the seventies, and see how one man can change history.You deserve to watch this movie.Amund Hansen",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The only activist that I would come to befriend...,"While I've heard and read about the rumours surrounding Harvey Milk, I can't say that I'm stunned to say most were all false... This man, this inspiration to millions of people was so much larger than any movie could ever capture - this film comes the closest to it. I'm gay, with a Partner of 15 years and while our Conservative leanings differ somewhat, Harvey Milk is probably the only activist that I would be proud to call an extended member of my family. The risks that he took to combat the issues the ultimately gave rise to the rights of millions was selfless, heroic and dignified, opening eyes and hearts to the fact that we are all Human Beings, we're all different, and we're all beautiful, and that we can coexist in a way that is beneficial to each of us. Bigotry will always exist, unfortunately... But when we all work together toward a common goal, to promote a peaceful and loving World, we all gain from the work that is not always easy. But nothing easy is really worth the fight, and the fruits of those fights never last long. As Neil Peart is quoted saying, ""Dedicated to the future, with honour to the past."" A well done account of the lives of Harvey Milk and so many others whos contributions will forever be among us.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Milk shakes its nutrient-rich substance to produce a delectably important biopic.,"No fat free milk. No semi-skimmed froth encrusting the top layer. Lactose is included. Just whole Harvey Milk dairy, freshly pasteurised by superlative direction and sharp writing. Much like fine wine, Milk tastes exquisitely with age, consistently complementing current democratic strands of chaos. Highlighting the significance of a single vote in a referendum without glorifying the omnipotence of activism.Harvey Milk, for all intents and purposes, was the first openly gay individual to be elected for public office in the shining state of California. Combatting initiatives such as Proposition 6, the banning of homosexuals to acquire careers in public schools. As a homosexual myself, who had been unfortunately suppressed into the ""closet"" due to fear of zero familial acceptance, Harvey Milk can only be described as an LGBT hero. The focus on political lobbying and general activism never dissipates, with Van Sant constantly presenting Penn as a voluptuous sculpture for gay rights. And, whilst it would've been supremely simple to resort to a melodramatic approach by documenting the several deaths and polygamous relationships in Milk's life, Van Sant opted for a subversive aesthetic.By combining archival footage of police raids and controlled protests with the core dramatisation, Van Sant effortlessly blended a documentarian style with a standard biographical narrative. In doing so he enabled Milk to remain human throughout, retaining an ever-important reminder of the work that he had lovingly committed to, not just for his own acceptance into the community, but for every LGBT representative.Ingeniously, Black addressed Milk and Moscone's assassinations from the offset, establishing a flashback narrative structure to illustrate Milk's political career. From opening a store entitled Castro Camera to campaigning against Christian fundamentalists. Black's audacious dialogue inserted a substantial amount of characterisation, often resorting to humour and sassy quips, whilst tackling the heavier subjects at hand. Further humanising Milk and his supporters. The representation of opposing conservatives were also well-developed, with Milk's fellow supervisor White gaining the most traction in comparison to Briggs and Feinstein. Offering a clash of perspectives in the democratic environment, eventually building up to a subdued yet profound climax that unleashed an endless candlelight vigil lighting up the streets of San Francisco.Van Sant's astute direction, specifically the inclusion of multiple one take sequences of delicious dialogue, would not have been as effective if it wasn't for one element. An aspect to which the entire biopic relied on. Sean Penn as Harvey Milk. Without a doubt, one of the greatest performances to ever grace our screens. Rarely do I take issue with heterosexual actors portraying homosexuality, and his unanimously acclaimed performance is a valid reason why. Very shortly after his presence was noticed, subverting his typical ""hard as nails"" gritty roles, I no longer saw Penn. Through sheer mannerism changes, he transformed. The whispering voice, the exaggerated hand motions and the gentle personality. Deserving of any and all awards that he received.Hirsch was just as transformative portraying fellow supporter Jones, fully embodying gay culture into a singular character. Brolin and Luna also offering noteworthy performances. Franco on the other hand failed to replicate the same quality. His monotonous delivery felt reminiscent to 'Pineapple Express' or any other stoned comedy. Elfman's score, whilst enabling a lighter tone throughout, occasionally overwhelmed the more emotional sequences. Some jarring jump cuts edited by Graham also further relinquished the effectiveness of Milk's central character and the pace.However, as a dramatisation of a leading figure in LGBT history, Van Sant delivered the goods. Yet, as a reminder for both heterosexuals and homosexuals alike for how archaic life was, Milk is absurdly powerful. As a ""fellow degenerate"", I stand alongside everything that Harvey Milk represented, enabling the LGBT community to come ""out of the closet"".",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Without hope, life's not worth living.""  ""Without hope, life's not worth living.""","I won't go into the legacy of Harvey Milk except to say that he was a champion for the LGBT community, especially in his efforts to get everyone to be honest and come out of the closet so that all of us could see that we had friends, relatives, teachers, and others in our lives that were gay, and that was OK.I won't say anything about the slime on the right depicted in this film except to say that their plan backfired. Yes, the battle for equal rights for all Americans is still being fought, and battles will continue to be lost along the way, but right will win in the end.The movie was excellent, and I really liked the way news footage from the period was intertwined seamlessly to make the experience more real.Josh Brolin was very good and there was a tortured underbelly that was not revealed. Maybe I am just to the point that it never surprises me when a right wing bigot turns out to have secrets.Sean Penn was magnificent. He was Harvey Milk, and he was the movie.

'Milk' blazes the trial for Hollywood GLBT political films.,"""Milk"" is the rare counter culture Hollywood film which touches your heart with its spot on directing and wonderful award winning performances by Sean Penn, James Franco and Emily Hirsh. Sean Penn won the Best Actor Oscar as the first openly gay elected politician and activist, Harvey Milk. Right before Penn calls out to the academy in his acceptance speech, ""You homo-loving sons of guns! "" Robert DeNiro said to the Penn, ""How did you fool us for so many years by playing straight men?"" I bring this up because the smiling Penn is so convincing as the gay leader. 'MILK' conjures up the excitement of the emerging gay activism in the Bay area and the extreme sadness of his untimely death. The viewing of the film benefits with the timely release during last years Proposition 8 battle in California. It will likely become as important of Hollywood film as ""Brokeback Mountain"" was a few years back.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
What a lovely moving film.,"Milk - Milk chronicles the last eight years of Harvey Milk (Sean Penn)'s life as he fights for gay rights in the 1970s. It's hard to evaluate films in a vortex. It's especially hard when so much concerning gay rights affects people every day. In the 1970s there was a nationwide movement to ban openly gay citizens from numerous positions including teaching. They were (and still are) put in the same camp as sexual deviants, pedophiles and those who partake in bestiality.Brokeback Mountain was the favorite film of everyone for its topic of gay characters. However it was also an imperfect somewhat boring film largely bereft of entertainment value aside from a great performance from the late great Heath Ledger. Aside from what its viewers attached to it, Brokeback was just a love story without any real political stance, though a stepping stone for better future homosexual films.Milk, on the other hand, has (real) gay characters stepping out of the closet, making a stance on their situation as the more conservative side of society steps on their rights to even function as regular members of society. This film is about hope, equality and justice. It's about the first gay man to demand and seize his rights rather than wait petulantly for someone to take pity. What a fascinating and genuinely nice person Harvey Milk was if we judge by Sean Penn's performance. It's almost laughable to think that anyone should be afraid of him. Harvey was such a sweet fellow, but persistent and inventive as heck.Issues aside (and that's hard to do here), Milk is an entertaining well made film that I feel like I could watch over again, something only the masochistic could say of Brokeback Mountain. Gas Van Sant is no stranger to homosexuality in his films, though he gives it sentimentally and sensitivity unlike with My Own Private Idaho. Milk is very moving as well. The end is sure to move you. The imagery too is just wonderful. I enjoyed the aesthetics Van Sant uses in some shots like the scene shot from the reflection of a safety whistle offered as protection. I was reminded of Kinsey once in awhile. The films share the same sort of tone. That film was about being comfortable with ourselves sexually. This one is about being comfortable with what others do. We have to love and respect each other as brothers and sisters without the quibbling over what is ""right"". We just need to agree that what's important is what ""right for you."" Charming, entertaining and moving, Milk gets an A-",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
11/10 A True Masterpiece,"I don't usually write reviews but... this film has me speechless. I hadn't heard of Harvey Milk until I was made to do a speech on him in English class. So fortunate to get to read his story, I started to look into what else was written and filmed about him. When I found this movie, I didn't expect a whole lot, although I knew that the actors in it were well known and acclaimed. I can honestly say that this is one of the most spectacular films I have ever watched.Sean Penn delivers an unforgettable performance with such close resemblance to the actual Harvey Milk. He perfects his nuances and makes himself a lovable and powerful character. The way that Milk is able to make light of dark situations enhances the mood and gives the audience hope,and Penn did a fantastic job transforming himself and living his role. By far, this is his best film and he has definitely earned the Oscar he won.James Franco, Josh Brolin, Emile Hirsch, Diego Luna, and the rest of the cast are perfectly chosen for their roles, and their acting is believable and realistic. They all enhance Penn's role, and highlight how important Milk was to the entire gay community and the minorities. They also show how selfless and determined he was in the face of such hate and discrimination, and how he was willing to put himself out there for other people. Truly an amazing human being.Gus Van Sant brings another amazing piece to the table, and incredibly weaves this film together. It is an incredibly powerful work of art that most definitely will leave you in tears.I truly believe that every person should watch this film, gay or straight, because it leaves an impact so great that may really change the way you think about the world and the people in it. The love scenes between Sean Penn and James Franco, and some other ones later on between other characters, are so perfectly played out where the audience will not feel uncomfortable, but instead see that it is not just two men kissing, but it is two HUMAN BEINGS in love.This film has had a major impact on me, and that is the most amazing type of film. It has left me with hope for the minorities who are feeling discriminated against, and it truly proves that ANYBODY can change the world. With the hate and challenges that Harvey faced, including people such as Anita Bryant, he persevered and stood up to what he believed in. He is perhaps the most inspiring public figure to me, and he has definitely made me a better person today. This film teaches people to fight for what's right, and that we are all human beings, no matter race, gender, or preference. So whoever you are out there reading this, WATCH IT and I know that you will not be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Strong, inspiring, thought-provoking","I don't even know where to begin here. 'Milk' is a truly inspiring story of Harvey Milk, an American gay activist. It is a story beautifully told, a combination of great film-making, and a brilliant acting ensemble, with Sean Penn as an extremely strong lead, capturing Milk's determination, faith and positive attitude. As for the rest of the cast, every one of them was exceptional. You could wish for more character development when it comes to some of the characters, but it's just a little thing compared to the rest of the film. From the technical point of view, I loved the use of archive footage, which not only helps you feel like you are in the 70s, but also actually helps you wrap your head around the fact that this is actually a biopic, and all of the events did take place those 30 odd years ago. It has been a long time since a film had affected me so deeply emotionally. The issues raised in this are still around today, and this was a man who felt he needed to make a change. He is an example to follow. Moving and thought-provoking. See it.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Many actors just play the role and be in character whenever there are some powerful scenes, but Sean Penn was in the character from start to end not missing any spot, while giving speeches one can notice his hand movements,they were just perfect, even when he was showing Emile Hirsch his office,the scene isn't that important but he played it perfectly, and that's a performance when you act between your lines.The way the story is told and how intelligently they put the real footage in between the film was amazing, this gave more credibility to what is shown as the inspiring story of Harvey Milk.It gives you hope,the strength of never backing down and shows what the society thinks is your weakness could be your strength.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

And the makeup department did a fine job making them look like their real world counterparts.While a bit more focus on Milk's Jewish roots might have been nice, this was not germane to the film and can probably be overlooked. In fact, this picture serves as a broad overview of gay rights history. How accurate it is may be debatable, but it will have those who are curious looking into more about the Castro, Milk, Anita Bryant and other things brought up here.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A moving, frequently amazing picture...","Sean Penn won a well-deserved Best Actor Oscar for portrayal of Harvey Milk, the first openly-gay man elected to public office, serving on the Board of Supervisors in San Francisco circa 1978. One of Harvey's co-workers, Dan White (well-played by Josh Brolin) was disgruntled at Milk's progress and his embracing by fellow Board members, as well as by Mayor George Moscone. Moscone, who backed Harvey's ideals (not to mention his lifestyle, which White couldn't comprehend), was just as guilty in Dan White's eyes of destroying the fabric of the country as Milk, thus ending a colorful and riveting chapter in American history. Screenwriter Dustin Lance Black guides us carefully through Milk's early political ambitions and formation as a possible contender in the political arena, which was full of stop-and-start success. Milk's sexual escapades are softened a bit by the editing, with randy interludes and wild celebrations seen mostly in quick clips. Nevertheless, we get all we need from director Gus Van Sant's intuitive camera, which picks up little bits of character business on the fly, shaping the personalities on the screen. The large ensemble cast works at an incredibly high artistic level, while the masterful art direction and production design (with snippets of mid-1970s footage interspersed) put the audience right there on Market Street in the Castro. The narrative has been streamlined for dramatic purposes, yet is no less powerful for it, particularly to viewers unaware of Harvey Milk's pioneering achievements. ***1/2 from ****",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the ten best films of the decade,"Even those unsympathetic to the political message of this film would have to admit its superb dramatic expression of that message. Rarely does one find such consonance between writer, actor, and director. Penn's trenchant portrayal of Harvey Milk will be studied by aspiring actors for at least a generation if not longer.It is no mean task for a filmmaker to take on a gripping true story where the ending is known in advance. There are no clichés here, no shortcuts, no tongue-in-cheek asides. The script follows a logical development of the eponymous character despite sudden shifts in time, and winds up at the end without disturbing anyone's sense of suspense. It's hard to say whether that attribute stems from the writer or the director; I suppose in all fairness one must cite it as the result of close collaboration.I first viewed this film on a four-inch screen in a transatlantic flight from London to Chicago. Not even the stunning beauty of glaciers in Greenland could sway my attention from it. When I saw it later on a normal screen I was even more impressed by its excellence.Watch it not so much for the message as for the basic humanity conveyed.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A top-notch representation of one of America's most intolerant times,"Following the 1960s when America struck a chord with the Civil Rights Movement that helped fight against the prejudice against African-Americans, was the election of San Francisco's supervisor Harvey Milk, who made a name for himself when he became the first gay man in American history to take office as supervisor. This event made history during the years of when the homosexual community faced with mass intolerance from citizens left and right. Ranging from religious reasons, to outright insecurity of sexuality; citizens everywhere, particularly the Conservatives, found it difficult to bear homosexuals as functioning individuals of society, going as far as to call them ""rapists"", ""child molesters"", ""freaks"", the list goes on. Many people feared these kinds of individuals were mortal threats to society. This engaging historical biopic directed by Gus Van Sant (Good Will Hunting) paints an awe-inspiring picture of the titular man's journey to making history in one of our country's most intolerant times, from his 40th birthday to his infamous assassination in 1978. Sean Penn plays Harvey Milk, a man from New York who moves to San Francisco, California with his lover Scott Smith (played by James Franco) where they witness extreme hostility against gay individuals by the hands of the public including the police force. Milk decides it's time to take a stand against society's bigotry and launches a movement in an outcry for equal rights. With young college kid Cleve Jones (played by Emile Hirsch) and Scott by his side, Milk runs for office and leads a fight to secure gay rights while facing conflict against Conservative attorney Dan White (played by Josh Brolin) and Senator John Briggs (played by Denis O'Hare).Unless you are a member of the LGBT community or lived in San Francisco during the 70s, there's a fair chance you're not familiar with Harvey Milk. But by many means, this biopic shines light on what made him one of the most influential political figures in the history of our country, and Gus Van Sant handles the story with realism and sincerity. Opening up with shots of archival news footage dealing with crime and brutality against the homosexual community, the movie gives a clear sneak peak of what we are getting into. We are then introduced to a barely recognizable Sean Penn and James Franco with a scraggly 70s hair style in 1970 when their two characters first meet and begin their intimate relationship. Their story continues in later years when they bear witness to the harsh maltreatment against the homosexual community as the population rapidly increases. These moments hit hard and paint a clear picture of the tyranny the gay community faced. From there on, Harvey Milk's story from his beginning days of activism to rise in the political ladder progress in an inspiring story. Gus Van Sant does a pleasant job of not only humanizing the characters of both sides of the central political issue, but handles the plot in a way that tells a compelling story without sparking tediousness by focusing more on the subject matter than the storytelling. The story hits many crucial spots including the outcry of the Christian community, the fight against the Preposition 6 that allowed schools to fire teachers who were found gay, and the complex relationship between Milk and attorney Dan White. And the thanks to Gus Van Sant'a execution, the story delivers with wit. Sean Penn and James Franco are tremendous in their roles, as is Josh Brolin as the titular character's rival. The cast gives the best of their talent to the point where you can't help to admire how committed these actors are.Milk is an outstanding historical biopic with an endearing performance by lead Sean Penn, and pays a great tribute to a man who made American history. Whether you agree with the political views of the titular figure or not, this film paints a great cinematic effort and brings it to life with Gus Van Sant's incredible direction. It is a film that is not powerfully presented, but falls astonishingly relatable of what still goes on today.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sean Penn's performance makes the remake worthwhile!!!!!!!!!!,"In 1977, Harvey Milk was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, becoming the first openly gay man to be voted into public office in America. His victory was not just a victory for gay rights; he forged coalitions across the political spectrum. From senior citizens to union workers, Harvey Milk changed the very nature of what it means to be a fighter for human rights and became, before his untimely death in 1978, a hero for all Americans. During the last eight years of his life, while living in New York City, he turns 40. Looking for more purpose, he and his lover Scott Smith relocate to San Francisco, where they found a small business, Castro Camera, in the heart of a working-class neighborhood. Then, with support from Scott and from new friends like young activist Cleve Jones, Milk plunges headfirst into the choppy waters of politics. Bolstering his public profile with humor, Milk's actions speak even louder than his gift-of-gab words. When Milk is elected supervisor for the newly zoned District 5, he tries to coordinate his efforts with those of another newly elected supervisor, Dan White. But as White and Milk's political agendas increasingly diverge, their personal destinies tragically converge.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A sure winner,"Sean Penn never tries to show Harvey Milk as a hero, and never needs to. He shows him as an ordinary man, kind, funny, flawed, shrewd, idealistic, yearning for a better world. He shows what such an ordinary man can achieve. Milk was the right person in the right place at the right time, and he rose to the occasion. So was Rosa Parks. Sometimes, at a precise moment in history, all it takes is for one person to stand up. Or sit down.Gus Van Sant and screenwriter Dustin Lance Black pull off something very close to magic. They make a film that's both historically precise and as graceful, unpredictable, and moving as a good fiction film--that is to say, a work of art.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Great Film But Not Historically Accurate!,"I had to accept Hollywood wasn't going to show the actual history of life in San Francisco in November 1978. The film is great but not accurate as it fails to mention details to better understand Harvey Milk's legacy. He became a gay icon and legend for the gay rights movement. The film is told largely from Milk's perspective with him at a recorder. He knows that he's a target and doesn't see the danger close by. Sean Penn deserved his Academy Award for playing Harvey Milk with a complexity of a multi-dimensional character. The supporting cast is stellar including James Franco as one of his lovers. Alison Pill is terrific as Anne Kronenberg. Victor Garber was fine as Mayor Moscone. Josh Brolin was brilliant as the troubled, unstable Dan White. The film doesn't project all facets of Milk's career. He was largely the most visible gay politician in the seventies and they're have been others like Barney Frank, Christine Quinn, and more to come out and service the public.

One Man Who Made A Difference,"""During one of the early campaigns, I started opening my speeches with the same line and it sort of became my signature... Hello, I'm Harvey Milk, and I'm here to recruit you."" This is a story of one shy gay man, Harvey Milk, who realized on his 40th birthday that his life needed a radical change (hey, no pun intended!). Harvey's meteoric rise from observer to activist and then to savvy politician occurred in less than a decade, as the film fondly keeps reminding us. Transplanted from the Big Apple in 1972, he realized that the issue of civil rights for the GLBT community transcended geographical borders and closed minds. He settles in San Francisco's Castro district, which became the central area for Milk's campaign and the flash point of the GLBT civil rights movement on the west coast.Penn is secure in his skin as the assertive gay rights activist and up-and-coming political figure. Honest, vulnerable, and passionate about gay rights, Harvey encourages everyone he meets to step outside of their carefully constructed lives to become involved in the gay rights movement.""A homosexual with power... that's scary,"" he prophetically remarks.And scary it is – to the conservative world that San Francisco Superintendent Dan White inhabits. Jame Brolin is tightly wound up as White, helplessly watching his world changing at lightening speed and intensely angry about it, ultimately taking his rage out on Superintendent Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone. Hypersensitive, overreacting to every imagined slight by Milk, Brolin is careful not to cross the line into broad caricature of the man who snapped one quiet day.Diego Luna as Jack Lira and James Franco as Scott Smith are both well-cast as long-suffering lovers of Milk, both chafing at the demands his activism places on their relationships, with one heartbreaking consequence. Emile Hirsch as Cleve Jones is pretty forgettable until his 15 minutes of fame finally arrive.Gus Van Sant, long a director of such Indie classics as My Own Private Idaho, succeeds in giving us a three - dimensional view of Milk's world of political activism and valued friendships. Van Sant seamlessly incorporates original film footage from this politically restless period to create a sense of a growing movement, without making it look like a documentary film. Strong performances from Sean Penn, Josh Brolin, and a good supporting cast of Emile Hirsch, Diego Luna, James Franco, make this a great film to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Encouraging people to come out of the closet,"This is a biopic about Harvey Milk, a person I only remember through a news item---when he was killed along with San Francisco Mayor George Moscone (Victor Garber). Their assassin, Dan White (Josh Brolin), will probably be best remembered for the 1979 trial in which his attorney tried to use something that would later be known as the ""Twinkie defense."" As the movie begins, Harvey Milk (Sean Penn), is on the verge of his 40th birthday and feels that he has done nothing with his life. He meets his partner and soon-to-be campaign manager, Scott Smith (James Franco), in a NYC subway station. They move to San Francisco and open a camera shop in the predominately gay district called the Castro. Harvey becomes a gay-rights activist and attempts to run for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. After three attempts, and much work to politically organize his district, he is elected as the first openly gay candidate ever to be elected in America (in 1977). During his political career, he encourages a large number of people to come out of the closet and declare their gayness openly.After seeing this movie, I put the 1984 documentary, The Times of Harvey Milk, at the top of my Netflix queue since I wanted to see more about Milk and see how well Penn portrays him in this movie. The only thing that I don't look forward to is Harvey Fierstein's narration: I don't like his grading voice.

To be honest, how Gus Van Sant didn't win for Best Director is beyond me, especially considering what DID win (Slumdog Millionaire? I mean, it's good, don't get me wrong). If you don't know the story, good. Watch this movie, then go onto wikipedia or go to your local library.

It's a bold move on Van Sant's part to film a story where some people know the ending already, and it's even bolder to TELL everyone said ending in the opening scene of the film. However, this is a move that works out well in Van Sant's favor, as I believe the purpose of the film was not to tell a heartbreaking story, but an inspirational story of a man fighting for a cause, a story that is easily related, no matter what cause that man could be fighting for. It also helps that Van Sant's lead is nothing short of fantabulous in the title role.What I like most about ""Milk"" is that, unlike most biopics, the film doesn't just tell us the story of Harvey Milk. It tells us the story of how his life changed a city, a country, and attitudes across the planet. It expands better than other biopics like ""Walk the Line"" and ""Capote"", and thus it stands alone as a good film. Van Sant's creative and flamboyant direction pits us in the fun times of the 1970's in San Francisco, and when we meet the simply delightful Harvey Milk, we don't ever want to leave his side.We don't ever want to leave his side because Sean Penn plays Mr. Milk with such charisma and such realism that the resemblance between Penn and the real Milk is simply uncanny. His simple mannerisms and bubbly vocal choices make his Harvey Milk one of the best performances of the year. I especially enjoyed how Penn completely disappeared into the role, as I've never seen him act this way before. He ditches his usual over-the-top screaming to develop his character through peace, words, and smiles. And what a wonderful choice he has made. I would say that the credit can go to Gus Van Sant as well, but because the supporting cast is nowhere near as stellar as Penn, I'm going to give all the credit to Penn's excellence as an actor.The aforementioned supporters are, again, nowhere near the level that Penn is. Josh Brolin's two-faced portrayal of Dan White is remarkable, and probably the next best performance in the film. Though I prefer his turn in ""W."" more than this one, there's no denying that Brolin is quickly becoming an A-lister, taking numerous and diverse roles which allow him to show a lot of range. James Franco and Emile Hirsch play their roles well, with Hirsch doing a little more for me than Franco. I found Diego Luna to be rather annoying, though I think that was the point.""Milk"" is an inspirational story that does the job of fighting for a cause. However, Van Sant is not preaching gay rights here. He's preaching freedom for everyone, paralleling what the real Milk did in his life. His film is beautifully shot and scored, and the makeup job done on Penn is wonderful (he seriously looks about 10 years younger).However, while all of this is great, I found that the film, itself, was just 'good' in terms of an engaging story, while Penn himself was excellent. The film's biggest strength is its biggest flaw: Penn overshadows everything and everyone in the film. Though Penn's performance should go down as one of the all time greats, the film is somewhat forgettable. By forgettable, I mean I didn't think about the film again until about 3 days after I saw it. I really don't know what it was, but ""Milk"", despite being technically wonderful and well made, just didn't have a lasting impression, and feels a bit outdated, mostly because there hasn't been a ton of progress in gay rights since Milk's activism, and it's even more sad because of the recent passage of Proposition 8.""Milk"" is a movie that looks like a bar graph. Every bar, representing a different aspect of the film, is up at a ""B"" level. However, there's one single bar, right in the middle, that shoots all the way up to ""A+"". That's the bar that represents Sean Penn. The rest of the film can't keep up with him, and this is what hurts the movie the most. Van Sant's direction is great, but is it, as well as the film itself, Oscar worthy? In this viewer's opinion, no.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Milk and Honey,"2008; a year that has given us blockbuster fodder and low brow plot lines. One film comes out shining from a year of sporadic thumbs up and down; Gus Van Sant's Milk. After this year's election, you may be sick and tired of the words 'change' and 'maverick', but it is hard not to utter those words without knowing who Harvey Milk was: a Long Island businessman who changed the political climate by becoming the first openly gay man to hold a seat in public office. Finally, someone can cross John McCain out of the definition of maverick.The film begins in San Francisco, 1978. Harvey Milk recollects his life into a tape recorder days before being assassinated by fellow worker, Dan White. It may seem like an overly dramatic opening to tug at the Oscar crowd, but Milk's love of the theater made him want to give a strong final bow. Thus, begins the odyssey into Milk's life as a businessman, activist, and lover.Who could be better suited to cover the liberating energy and electricity of 1970s San Francisco than Gus Van Sant? Van Sant's use of stock footage and 16mm cameras brilliantly capture Castro Street at the peak of its civil unrest towards the bigotry and violence that has manifested itself from the likes of Anita Bryant and the local police. Van Sant and cinematographer Harris Savides revive the steady cam shot intensity used in Elephant and is blended with the quick-pace editing reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange.The driving force behind this brilliant film is the breed of astonishing actors. James Franco casts aside the tangled web of Spiderman films and delivers an incredible performance as Scott Stevens, Milk's lover. You see the vulnerability and fear behind his seductive charm. Emile Hirsh bowled over audiences last year with Into the Wild. He raises the bar with his second collaboration with Sean Penn as Cleve Jones, the street hustler turned political adviser for Harvey Milk, whose flamboyance and liveliness illuminate the screen.From stoner-surfer Jeff Spicolli to his Oscar award-winning role in Mystic River, Sean Penn has delivered 25 years of astounding and solid performances. Milk is Penn's finest hour as he gives his most powerful performance in his career. He doesn't just emulate Harvey Milk, he is Harvey Milk. The compassion and political rage Penn has been widely known for is channeled into a man, whose voice is as loud as it was thirty years ago from Proposition 6 to Proposition 8. It's a little early to tell who should be snagging an Oscar nomination, but after seeing his performance as Harvey Milk, it is safe to say that Penn will not be cast asunder from the public eye.Next to Penn, Josh Brolin's performance as Milk's assailant, Dan White, is remarkably intense and stunning. Brolin has given back-to-back stellar performances in No Country For Old Men and W. His portrayal as Dan White is one of great depth and intrigue into the mind of a man who acted out on fear and envy by ending the lives of Milk and Mayor George Moscone. As you get into the heart of the film, you look at the man behind the political mask as he slowly loses his balance, such as getting into a drunken heated argument with Milk or masking his contempt while watching him on TV.Milk is an important film, not just the fact that it tells the story of a true American hero, but it is a film that looks at the fine line between intolerance and change in American politics. Thirty years after Milk's death, his life and legacy remains as strong as ever, and it takes a devoted group of actors and a brilliant director, like Van Sant, to tell his story.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Possibility to be an all-time classic,"Gus Van Sant's talent and humility allows Harvey Milk to be a the center of this remarkable story without putting himself in front of the camera. Sean Penn shines like never before as Harvey Milk. His humanity is overwhelming at times. That permanent smile defining his face talks volumes about his faith in people, no matter how they may feel towards him. He is truthfull and childlike innocent, he worries he's about to be 40 and hasn't hit the bigtime. Little did he know. The film is constructed brilliantly in a series of vignettes that builds up into a whole fluid narrative. Josh Brolin, as the disturbed Dan White is another standout in a complex and remarkable performance. No cheap shots here. Diego Luna, Joseph Cross and Emile Hirsch are also terrific as the boys around Harvey but it is James Franco who truly gets your undivided attention. His romantic turn is one of the most erotic gay love stories I've ever seen (and I've seen Brokeback Mountain at least a dozen times). See this masterpiece, you won't regret it.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Don't knock it till you've tried it....the film people, the film!","San Francisco in the early 1970s and Harvey Milk, an out of the closet gay man, wants to turn his new home on Castro Street into a bohemian refuge for like minded gays. Meeting resistance and witnessing the groundswell of hate towards his kind, Milk begins campaigning to be elected to public office, where he hopes he can alter the perceptions of the gay way of life. But as Milk's popularity grows, so does his national standing, and with that comes greater responsibilities, and perhaps, greater enemies.....Harvey Milk was the first openly gay man to get voted into a major public office of America, that's not a spoiler, this is a fact, and this smart biography of the man charts his rise to that position....and what was to follow. Director Gus Van Sant clearly cared about this project {Milk known to be a hero of his}, and in truth it shows. Gone has the wishy washy feel of his overtly independent pictures, and in its place comes professional slickness backed up by one of 2008's great lead performances. Sean Penn has an habitual knack of rubbing people up the wrong way, often derided for his opinions and frowned upon for his perceived aggressive nature, it surely can only be the most stoic of Penn haters who can deny that the man has acting talent in abundance. Here as Harvey Milk he double layers the performance with impressive emotional urgency, so much so good is his performance, that after five minutes of film you forget that it's actually Penn playing a role, he has quite literally become Milk and in the process bagged another richly deserved Golden Statuette.Tho to put Milk's winning charm purely down to Penn would be doing a big disservice to a fine supporting cast. Led by the ever excellent Josh Brolin {Dan White} and with impact turns coming from Emile Hirsch {Cleve Jones}, James Franco (Scott Smith) and Diego Luna (Jack Lira), it's with much credit that all of them are comfortable with the story and deliver such telling performances. So what quite stops Milk from being a modern day masterpiece? A piece of work to shine in this modern age of acceptance? Well for all its well crafted intention, and the easily accepted chest thumping for gay pride, it just fails to really knock down any doors {or open new ones in fact}. Van Sant's picture is a well informed snapshot of the times, and certainly raises some posers about politics and sexual preferences, but really it doesn't leave a lasting impression outside of Penn's sublime performance, and that kind of feels like a wasted opportunity to me.But cest la vie, one thing I'm sure Van Sant will be pleased about, is that once viewed, Milk is a name that few will ever forget about, and maybe that was all Van Sant wanted to achieve in the first place? 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Milk Hits All the Right Notes, But Something's Missing","A very straightforward, by-the-books biopic of Harvey Milk, San Francisco city supervisor and gay rights martyr. Political biographies are tough in that they always seem to have a clear agenda, and even though I happen to agree wholeheartedly with the message behind this one, it's still a very one-sided telling. The two factions at the center of the film's central argument are presented as sharply black and white, with few figures outside of Harvey's inner circle given credit for the reforms that were passed during his brief public career, and that seems to stand at odds with the core values of unity and equality that the film keeps talking up. Sean Penn deserves credit for his bold portrayal of the titular activist and politician; Milk's character arc is clear and powerful as we watch him grow from a shy, closeted New York businessman into a well-spoken social rights figurehead. That evolution is joyful but slow moving, and it often gets lost amongst the hustle and bustle of his increasingly active social and sex lives. It's an important story that's every bit as relevant today as it was in 1978, but the film translation lacks the punchiness and fresh identity I was looking for. Good, perhaps even very good, but no better.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wonderful film; to be embraced for its study of an outsider trying to get his voice heard during a somewhat increasingly volatile time.,"I think it's pretty fair to say, right at the beginning of this, that the man whose story it is we focus on in this film is dead. I know sometimes there's that conflicted sense of not wanting to know an awful lot about a famous individual going into a biopic all about them, particularly their fate, but in this case of Harvey Milk; who's the focus of Gus Van Sant's film from last year entitled Milk, everything is laid out in black and white very early on dispelling any doubt on whether the experience would be less-satisfying had you not known. Van Sant wants you to know he died a death in 1978, and he has every confidence in his execution of those final eight years of Milk's life that will make for an engaging and frightening experience anyway. The pleasing thing is, Van Sant is right on the money in this regard as his film is wonderful.Here is a Van Sant biopic we can cherish more-so we can despise or get frustrated at. Given the man's previous film was the sporadically received Last Days, which was again a film about a real person and documented their eventual downfall, or decline, into death of some description – you'd be forgiven for going into Milk with some doubts, particularly if you didn't take to the mumbling, sophomoric, and symbolist driven 2005 feature. Milk gives its subject room to breath, eight years worth in fact, and tells the story of an everyday guy who hadn't quite yet found his niché in life, but at forty years old, is still on the hunt.Going into the project, Van Sant had a lot to digest. His looking at a very specific period in a famous individual's life echoes what he did in Last Days with Kurt Cobain (supposedly), but the eight years out of forty-eight he observes here means that encompassing two relationships with separate male lovers; a power-house nation coming to terms with minority based people garnering strength and power through politics and a general making up of history as he went along on Milk's behalf are wonderfully captured and delivered with enough emotional and dramatic weight to label it a success.The titular role is played by the Oscar winning Sean Penn, a small but optimistic character who enjoys jumping head first into situations and predicaments no matter how seemingly dangerous or potentially hostile they might be. Milk is established as a man without much fear; the opening newsreel footage reporting his assassination sees the film jump straight into a very private and intimate moment in Harvey's life as we observe him recording his life story on a cassette tape which is, on his strict instruction, only to be played when he is dead – something that it seems Harvey is suspecting might be quite soon. It's an early example, indeed in the first scene, of Harvey confronting doubt and potential disaster head-on without shying away. Later on, he will receive death threats in the form of crude drawings displaying harm and mutilation of his person; but while those close to him panic, Milk faces facts and accepts people won't like him, indeed he seems to want to engage back with the perpetrators – criticising the pictures for lacking subtlety and humour but praising for effort none-the-less.The film is mostly a look at equality, and how most of those whose views and opinions on others restrict equality pushing through to become universal. Harvey Milk is just another guy attempting to make good with an American dream infused ideology, the fact that he's homosexual and involved in politics shouldn't matter – if the man is charismatic and people enjoy what it is he has to say in regards to his ideas, there ought not be a problem. Like every other working individual in America at that time, Milk is attempting to go bigger and better in a chosen career; a career he stumbles into when he and his then lover Scott Smith (Franco) move to San Fransisco from New York City and Milk becomes involved in gay activism. Harvey's predicament sees him forced into taking a position on the outskirts of society because of what he is and everyone's attitudes to what he is, while observing everything play out makes for genuinely interesting viewing. He is living his own American Dream after stumbling into his field of expertise and will not let anyone stop him from giving it a try.As an individual working within a choice of career in which your opinions and the manner in which you get them across depends on whether you, as a lone individual, succeed or not; Penn plays Milk less-so an extrovert or a show off, but a really charismatic and warm individual who just seems to talk sense. The film finds room to encompass Milk's romantic relationships running along side his more professional ones, but neither ever really detract nor distract from the other as the political work begins to overpower his home life; this in turn takes its agonising toll. Van Sant treats a lot of the more sensitive material with the greatest of respect, and that sense you're viewing a period in this man's life through that proverbial microscope as things go from strength to strength during which a man finds his form is fascinating. Certainly a film not to be missed.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Messiah of Castro Street,"I can't say that I have ever been much of a fan of Sean Penn as an actor. Despite all the praise he has gotten over the years, he has never been able to convince me that any of his characters are real. Even while watching him in his best films, MYSTIC RIVER and DEAD MAN WALKING, I always found myself thinking ""This would be so much better with a better actor in the part."" As such, I must grudgingly admit that he is absolutely wonderful in MILK. The awkward method mannerisms that plague most of Penn's work, and make his acting look like acting, are gone; he seems to melt into the character of Harvey Milk, an emotionally soft, but politically tough activist who somewhat reluctantly became the voice of the gay rights movement.Told in the usual this-happened-that-happened fashion of most film biographies, MILK is an efficiently told story, which nonetheless proves to be deeply moving. As much as it chronicles the growing public life of Harvey Milk, it also becomes the unfolding history of the gay rights movement as it grew in power and purpose during the 1970s. This is just, as Milk is a substantial part of that history; first because he made headlines as the first openly gay man to garner an important elected office, as a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. And because of his death at the hands of a political rival. His growing influence earned him the title of The Mayor of Castro Street. His untimely death made him the Martyr of Castro Street. To some extent, the film portrays him as the Messiah of Castro Street, a soft-spoken, gentle and fundamentally decent Christ-like purveyor of inspiration.Castro Street was the mecca of gay life in the 1970s, first for gay people in San Francisco and then for the country as a whole. It was a small section of San Francisco which offered a semi-safe haven for gay people who wanted to feel protected and accepted. Milk landed there in the early part of the decade and opened up a small camera shop amid the gay bars and bookstores. As a gay merchant he felt left out of the system. As a gay man he felt left out of society. Feeling something should be done, he ran for office and, after three failures, won. His low-key, ingratiating style helped to establish him as a high-profile personality and the epitome of ""we're here, we're queer, get used to it,"" a man who could be both forceful and non-threatening. His success at establishing gay rights laws gave him clout across the country, a voice the media could turn to as conservative anti-gay factions formed.Through the skillful use of news footage and recreation, director Gus Van Sant does a solid job of encapsulating a movement into two hours of cinema. He presents the anti-gay entities, such as Anita Bryant, with impersonal fairness, never resorting to cheap ridicule – though it is clear where his sympathies lie. Dealing with, but not dwelling on Milk's personal problems, the film interweaves Milk's private life with his growing activism, until his public persona overwhelms his personal life. As such, the film does seem a bit superficial in its portrait of Milk; much of the power of the story lies in the newsreel footage and the realization that the extraordinary events that are recreated are true. This leaves it up to Penn to fill in the blanks. He does so with assurance. Penn convincingly shows us Milk as being a quiet, reticent little man who learned to use his non-threatening image as a means of winning supporters, while becoming savvy to the ways of manipulating the media. Though he is supported by an ensemble of fine actors -- James Franco, Emile Hirsch, Josh Brolin, Victor Garber, etc. -- it is Penn who carries the film.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sean Penn is Milk!,"I use the word portray often when writing these comments, because ""playing"" a part that might be drawn from real people is leaving room for some playfulness that ""portraying"" an actual human on stage or screen shouldn't allow. A moral responsibility is undertaken with the acting challenge of transforming a real person's life story into a performance.And the performance Penn gives comes as close as possible to reincarnating the man who remains one of the most significant figures of 20th century America. Harvey Milk helped galvanize the spirits and activism of millions, not just gay but anybody concerned with honesty in government, police brutality, reforming the drug laws, cleaning up the streets and not penalizing the entire lives of those who didn't fit into the radical right wing's vision of the future.Director Gus Van Sant and the other actors deliver brilliantly, showing things as they were concerning the changing nature of San Francisco and the whole world meant having to confront the bigotry that was in full flight then and still is to an awful degree today. Emile Hirsch (portraying Cleve Jones) is one of the best young actors in the world and Josh Brolin gives another spot on exploration into the dark side of modern man.His Dan White was, shall we say, more active, with successive careers and otherwise, than the average man ever imagines being. The assassin of Milk and Mayor George Moscone (Victor Garber) was in the military, then became a firefighter and police officer before entering city politics. Whatever demons drove White to his ultimate fate remain known only to him (though at one point, Milk offers his own theory).""Milk"" is best appreciated with a viewing of Rob Epstein's ""The Times Of Harvey Milk"", an Oscar winning documentary that shows just how much Harvey meant to so many and how accurate Penn was with his Oscar winning portrayal.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Van Sant's Best To Date,"I've been a Van Sant fan since "" Drugstore Cowboy"" and "" My Own Private Idaho"". He is able to create masterful works of art while tackling some of the most controversial and difficult subject matter. This is his best work to date and a bravura biopic drama. This film has superlative direction, screenplay, cinematography, soundtrack, settings, costume and acting. Penn, Franco, Brolin, Hirsch, Luna, Cross and Pill are superb. Penn delivers the finest and most commanding portrayal of his stellar career. I've seen a documentary on Harvey and it was as if I was viewing actual footage of him. The plot revolves around Harvey Milk who became the first openly gay man elected to the first notable public office seat on the Board of Supervisors in San Francisco. Before accomplishing that goal Harvey, his partner Scott and friends transform the Castro District of San Francisco into a safe haven for gays and lesbians. He achieves these goals against all odds and some less then fair political opposition. He stood up to such bigots as Anita Bryant and John Biggs during the process. A member of his board is a politically and socially straight laced God fearing Christian Dan White. White has been on the supporting side of a proposition to ban gays and lesbians from teaching in public schools. This proposition sparks a course of events that leads White to becoming unhinged, hateful and out for vengeance. The plot is witty, clever, realistic, surreal, insightful, violent, exorcising, heart wrenching and cathartic. This film is an outstanding examination of how human beings pathetic inability to accept or at least tolerate beliefs other than their own has divided this country and destroyed lives unnecessarily. Van Sant's tribute and celebration of a groundbreaking and courageous man is flawless, bold and brilliant. This is a timeless classic and an ingenious film in it's genre.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"""Milk"" is real and emotional thanks to gifted direction, acting","Far and away the most emotional film of 2008 is the biopic of openly gay San Francisco city supervisor Harvey Milk. As a biopic, ""Milk"" may not seem like a very innovative or eye- opening film; we've seen films about crusaders for Civil Rights before, where small groups of citizens ban together to fight a large oppressive force, even where the hero is killed in the end. But even still, with Gus Van Sant at the helm and a handful of talented actors young and old, you've never seen a film like ""Milk.""Harvey Milk is played by Sean Penn, who continues to amaze audiences everywhere with not only very deep and believable performances, but transformative ones. In his best role since his Oscar-winning performance in ""Mystic River"" and his most astounding since ""I Am Sam,"" Penn is at surefire Oscar caliber. He captures everything from the hard-nosed politician side of Harvey Milk to the soft, effeminate side. He's so incredibly natural through every aspect that you don't often think about how good Sean Penn is: you're thinking about how interesting Harvey Milk is.But we've seen incredible performances like this in film's of this nature. What changes all that is Van Sant. Though it's been a decade since his landmark film ""Good Will Hunting,"" you wouldn't know it after watching ""Milk."" His greatest strength is to bring characters their humanity, to make each scene and all the dialog appear so real and natural. His camera is an observer, not an interferer. He picks and chooses his unique shots very carefully to enhancing meaning and not create it.This also strengthens the amazing supporting cast. Emile Hirsch, who starred in Penn's ""Into the Wild"" last year, continues to make the case that he will indeed be a great actor like the film's star, in his role as activist and community organizer Cleve Jones. Josh Brolin even makes Dan White--the supervisor that clashes with Harvey and ultimate brings about his demise--a character worthy of our sympathies. Van Sant gets the most out of everyone in this film, because this picture to him is very clearly about the movement more than the man.More than anything else, ""Milk"" is a story about the gay rights movement in 1970 and how San Francisco became the center of it thanks to the larger-than-life attitude of Harvey Milk. In his first major credit, writer Dustin Lance Black impresses, though his script has trouble reconciling the Harvey's personal life and his political career, ironically much like Harvey himself does. The film's core lies in what Milk meant to the movement and what he accomplished, not as much in how an openly gay man struggles in both his personal life and in his career when he chooses to do something like this. It's definitely there, but it's second. Still, the writing sensitively weaves all the aspects of Harvey's life together.""Milk"" is an emotional film. It doesn't try to be politically sensitive--those who do not support homosexuality will not find fair treatment from Van Sant and the film as a whole: they are the enemy. By focusing on the people that poured their lives into this work, ""Milk"" has you quickly identifying with the struggle that gay activists and gays in general dealt with at the time and to an extent still very much do today. It seeks to open the audience's eyes to the gay rights movement's history, using a lot of actual 70s footage. If you love this film it's because you get swept up in the emotion of the movement and the characters that so naturally fight for it and care about it and nothing else. Black and Van Sant are careful, however, not to portray Milk as a martyr--there is no liberal Hollywood agenda against conservative Christianity. This is about what Milk accomplished while he was alive and what he meant to the movement he fought passionately for.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

It seems to me that the film does justice to Milk's career and legacy in a way that Hollywood biopics of civil rights leaders rarely do. (Spike Lee's overrated ""Malcolm X,"" for instance, enervates its subject's radicality- suggesting that deep down, Malcolm just wanted to be accepted as an equal.) But I think part of the reason the film can do so is the problematic nature of Milk as a radical icon. While Harvey Milk displayed undeniable courage in becoming the first openly gay man elected to public office in the U.S. he still was very much a man of the system, of the machine he claimed to fight against. Milk would plant his lieutenants and have them incite insurrectional energy just so Milk could then appear and temper it, redirecting it into the voting booth. The film acknowledges this and asks us to admire Milk for it, which is why the film works on the level that it does. It is a film of the system trying to capture the ""radical"" energy of a man of the system.",,Anonymous,Biography
