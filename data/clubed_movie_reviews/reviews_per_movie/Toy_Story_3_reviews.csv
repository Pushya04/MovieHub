Toy Story 3 is not a movie for adults who DO NOT want to cry during a movie.,"The only Disney movie I cried in was Lion King. The other Disney film that came close was Pixar's WALL E. I did not cry during Toy Story 3. I went home walked into my room a realized that my Optimus Prime is not at the foot of my door, my Sylvester the Cat stuffed toy was not on my bed, and my McDonald's Sonic the Hedgehog toy was not on my shelf. My conner only housed my stack of video games. I asked myself why did my mother give away my toys without my permission? At THAT moment is when I thought about the last 30 minutes of Toy Story 3 I started to cry. This film was a carelessly thoughtful stoke of genius! It keeps both children and adults entertained. Lots of drama, lots suspense, and lots of toys! Disney and Pixar outdid themselves with this one. Toy Story was a smash hit when it first hit the screens. Toy Story 2, in my opinion, was not as good as its first installment but it was a film that almost never hit theaters so I'll give them the benefit of doubt. But Toy Story 3 set the bar ""to infinity and beyond!"" The VA cast was pheNOMenal. The visuals were stunning! The script was enjoyable! This movie reached all corners of film greatness (and its a kid's movie). I have no idea how Disney and Pixar knock out great movies like this (they make it look easy). I related to Andy in this film just as I did in Toy Story 3. The ending was so tough to watch without sniffling because if you watched Toy Story at around Andy's age during the time and you watch Toy Story 3 around Andy's age now (he was 17 and I am 22 and went through roughly the same hassle as he did when he was moving out for college), you would feel a wallop of emotion. Toy Story 3 is a MUST SEE. If you don't have children to take to go see this film then take friends who saw the first two films.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Metaphysics By Mattel,"Is there Life after playtime? Can you handle a film in which the toys are playing with us, the audience? The third chapter of the Toy Story saga asks some tough questions of viewers, but the rewards of seeing this remarkable film outweigh the emotional toll.It's the last week of summer before Andy heads off to college, and Woody (Tom Hanks) and the other remaining toys in Andy's bedroom find themselves in fear of what's to become of them. It looks like the attic, but events conspire to throw them a day-care center called Sunnyside. It looks swell enough, at first...""You'll never be outgrown, or neglected,"" the toys are informed by the chuckily plush play bear Lots-O (Ned Beatty). ""Never abandoned or forgotten. No owners means - no heartbreak!""It's odd to see a film series that started out as an animated lark turn into ""Watership Down"", but there's always been some existential angst at the heart of the enterprise, c.f. the fragile buddy system employed in the first ""Toy Story"", Sid's hapless victims, and talk of rummage sales. The second film pushed these buttons a bit harder, to the point of losing the humor.This time the drama is stronger than ever, yet the film amazingly manages to stay refreshingly clever and hilarious. We meet Ken (Michael Keaton), who introduces himself to Barbie saying ""We were made for each other"". Ken must deal with wisecracks about being a girl's toy, or as Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) puts it, ""an accessory, a purse with legs."" The daycare center is also fabulously realized, a cacophony of misfit toys all showing signs of wear from constant play. Every now and again we break away to see Woody in his new situation, being played with by a girl named Bonnie who is very nice but has a left-field imagination. ""We do a lot of improv here,"" another toy tells him.All this is very funny, and director Lee Unkrich and the Pixar writers and artists find brilliant ways to keep humor close to the center of things throughout. Yet this movie is no lark. One of the funniest scenes the first time I saw this movie three weeks ago, involving a cutaway to a clown staring at a window, got hardly a laugh when I saw it again tonight. I think it was because the rest of the audience, like me, knew what was coming; a sad story about cosmic indifference and cold-hearted abandonment which sets in motion the real emotional undertow of the film.Set against this is Woody's firm if shaken resolution to ""be there for Andy"", even when it seems he and the other toys are no longer wanted by their owner. It's a message of faith you relate to, yet it also brings out another point, the notion of change, even painful change, as needful. The toys know they'll be neglected, perhaps forever, if exiled to the attic, but prefer it to the unknown. This actually makes sense. What can happen out there isn't very nice, but even in the face of extinction the film suggests a certain nobility through acceptance can be still possible. It's a pretty heavy message to take away from watching a G-rated comedy.The film doesn't leave you on a down note, but it's a funny thing. In the past, I always looked forward to the post-credit goof scenes as something to laugh at on my way out of the theater. This time, I appreciated it just as much as a chance to wipe my eyes before I got out of my chair. It still felt good, though.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A worthy conclusion to a fantastic trilogy,"I've said this before, but I'll say it again: Pixar has shown with their initial ten films that they haven't the faintest clue how to make a bad movie. And yet, somehow, I always find myself feeling doubtful whenever a trailer for one of their new films is released. With Toy Story 3, I got the impression that it would be just another adventure with Woody and the gang for the sake of having one. So, with this, and a movie year that has been relatively lacking so far, would Toy Story 3 disappoint? The answer: absolutely not.Probably the most surprising aspect about this film is that, even after eleven years since the release of Toy Story 2, the material that has made this series so damn enjoyable hasn't been lost one bit here. All of the old characters are just endearing as ever, if not more so, and all of the new ones feel right at home here. Ken (voiced by Michael Keaton) is especially hilarious, to the point where even the mention of him got me laughing.To touch briefly on the visual front, the characters themselves are just as expressive as they've always been. However, like Wall-E, the world that they inhabit looks much more photorealistic this time around. Also, this is one of the few instances when the 3D aspect actually enhances the film. It's by no means as crucial to the experience in the same way that it was for Avatar, but it gives the film a little extra something.The action sequences, too, are spectacular. These are toys that we're talking about, and somehow, Pixar's managed to provide these scenes with one hell of a punch. Not much else to say about 'em other than that the climax in particular feels as epic as anything from The Lord of the Rings trilogy.What really puts Toy Story 3 above most films out there, though, is how it deals with the themes of loss and growing up. Even after getting to know these characters over the course of two films, I was still surprised by just how much I got sucked into their despair. Without giving anything away, there were two scenes that caused me to tear up, and even more that had me on the verge of doing so.Toy Story 3 is not only a worthy conclusion to a fantastic trilogy, but also the one third installment (other than Return of the King) that I feel is better than its predecessors. For all of the reasons already mentioned and more, it's one of the studio's best entries. Sorry for doubting you, Pixar, even if it was just for a bit.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
~One of the Best Trilogies of All Time~,"I attended a special screening for Toy Story 3. I went in with HIGH expectations. I LOVED the first two Toy Stories movies. Toy Story is a beloved franchise that almost everyone that I know loves the first two films. Now how about the 3rd film? Well all I could say is that it lived up to my unbelievably HIGH expectations and then some. This is such a good film. It has the laughs, magic and best of all the entertainment. The new characters in the movie feel like they were in the previous two films, they were that engaging and really worked well in the movie. The best part of the movie has to be the ending, I almost cried and was moved to just about to tears. I truly believe that this is one of the best Trilogies of all time. It might even rival the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.This movie has a real chance to become the First Animated Film to win Best Picture. I surely would not be surprised.10/10 An Amazing End to a Fantastic Series Go Watch It",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"An amazing third ""Story""","Lee Unkrinch directed ""Toy Story 3,"" the third and presumably final installment in the ""Toy Story"" movie franchise. One could argue that this is probably the best one yet (1999's ""Toy Story 2"" remains my personal favorite of the three), and I won't argue with those who think otherwise. I still hold onto ""Toy Story 2"" for deep personal reasons, but ""Toy Story 3"" does build upon events foreshadowed in the previous installment, which does gives this film a weighty emotional punch - a rarity in animated films these days.As foreshadowed in ""Toy Story 2,"" Andy (John Morris) has finally grown up; he's 17 now, and is on his way to college in just a few days. His mom is putting pressure on him to get rid of his old toys, either by throwing them out with the garbage, donating them to other needy children, or simply putting them in the attic (a sort of gone-but-not-forgotten-and-within-reach-type of deal).Woody (Tom Hanks), brave leader of the toys and Andy's favorite, manages to dodge a bullet somewhat, but puts himself in the line of fire when Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and the other toys are accidentally thrown out but somehow or another wind up at Sunnyside Daycare, where they are welcomed with open arms by the resident toys there. This introduces us to Lotso (Ned Beatty), the strawberry-scented teddy bear who runs the place, along with the metro-sexual Ken doll (Michael Keaton) and others. As it turns out, this daycare center is actually a prison, and Lotso runs this place with an iron fist; of course, Lotso has a very tragic back-story that explains his evil ways, much like with Jessie (Joan Cusack), who first appeared in ""Toy Story 2."" So Woody and the other toys must mount a valiant escape if they are to be reunited with their beloved owner before he leaves for college.""Toy Story 3"" is an amazing film, and a fitting end to a wonderful film series that started in 1995 with the first ""Toy Story,"" which also signaled the arrival of the very illustrious and extremely talented Disney-owned animation studio Pixar. They have yet another significant hit on their hands with this picture. The animation here is at its most life-like and real and it's damn-near flawless and strikingly beautiful, which signals just how far Pixar has come in the 15 years since their first hit with ""Toy Story."" And every film since then has added significant amounts of realism, weight, and dimension to their animated stories.While ""Toy Story 2"" had a high nostalgia factor for days long gone by, ""Toy Story 3"" is a film about the inevitability of children growing up and putting away their toys. There are also themes about the effect of loss, love, and friendship going in the proceedings here. In addition, ""Toy Story 3"" can also be an incredibly dark film at times - a bold move considering that this is a family film - but there's no need to worry because the fact is that it's all perfectly balanced out amazingly well with some very light-hearted humor, fast and furious action scenes, and stirring emotional moments that just might bring a few tears to your eyes.""Toy Story 3"" is a triumph of animation and imagination, and I say that as a die-hard ""Toy Story 2"" fan. What we get here, is a fitting closer (?) to an amazing film series that just continues to surprise again and again with each new entry. It's just a great reminder for all of us heartless adults of better days in our youth that have long gone bye-bye.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
How in the world did Pixar make adults CRY over TOYS??!,"The best magic tricks in the world are ones that cannot be unraveled, reverse engineered or dissected to figure out exactly how they are pulled off. This philosophy is doubly applicable to Pixar's ""Toy Story 3"", the storyline-ending outro of the beloved Toy Story, uh, story.I feel it relevant somehow to divulge my age, as it somehow validates the powerful emotions evoked throughout the film. I am a 28 year old male, who, fifteen years ago, was fresh into the teen years of supposed adolescence at the release of some weird, 3d animated movie (wait, they can animate with computers?) entitled ""Toy Story"". This was a pretty bold move, a calculated stroll to the edge of the cliff and a daring leap off into the thin air of creativity and innovation. And it was a hit, ensuring 3d animation a place right alongside (more or less) 2d animation. And naturally, Pixar would be at the forefront, leading the cavalry charge of digital animation ranging from great to gawd-awful.""Toy Story 3"" starts off as comfortably as possible, with our friends Woody and Buzz Lightyear doing what they do the best...playing with Andy in his world of make-believe adventure. We are then treated to some familiar Pixar progression, like abandonment, solidarity, coming back to friends, and the passing of the torch. Clearly, in the eleven years between this point and when ""Toy Story 2"" wrapped, a computer revolution or four has occurred, allowing a world of unsurpassed clarity, reality and imagination to shine through like never before. TS1's spark is TS2's candle, and that in turn is TS3's blazing sun.Roll the last fifteen minutes of film. It became clearly obvious that the figurative tables have been turned, because a good number of the adults in the audience (including myself) were sniffling and teary-eyed, while the kids were looking up, likely thinking ""jeez mom and dad, they're just toys, get over it"".Wasn't it conventional wisdom that just the kids get emotional over losing plastic playthings? With ""Toy Story 3"", Pixar has shown us one of the greatest magic tricks in modern showbiz history, likely not to be outdone or duplicated, that we all have very real and deep connections to our childhoods and to the things and people that allowed us as kids to be free, and innocent, and pure, and most importantly, to dream. This, to me, is a life lesson worth remembering, to infinity and beyond.""Toy Story 3"" gets 10 of 10 blazing stars",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"By delivering an amazing finale to an amazing trilogy, all we can do is bow and thank Pixar once again.","Star Wars. Indiana Jones. Fistful of Dollars. Bourne. These are all incredible trilogies that can, will, and should stand the test of time. Yes, I am neglecting the fourth Indiana Jones. Upon the mention of the third Toy Story, I was deathly afraid. Afraid because it has some major, major shoes to fill. The original is a masterpiece that changed animation forever, and the sequel is among the best in the history of film (I mean that). The first two Toy Story films are among the best movies of all-time and to this day entire animation studios have failed to duplicate an ounce of the magic contained in Toy Story. Could part 3 even come close to the original two? My friends, I am very happy to say, the answer is a resounding yes.Toy Story 3 does exactly what the first two did, delivered on all cylinders, all aspects of film-making and entertainment. The humor is back, the heart is back, the delightful cast of characters is back. This time, thanks to an incredible script, there's more suspense, more drama, and many more surprises. Like any spectacular trilogy, it wraps up all loose ends. It literally is difficult to find any flaw or any slow moment in this movie, and even if there is, it will immediately be forgiven by the next major laugh or the next major revelation. The predictability factor in this movie is low, and the payoff to all the suspense is extremely high. Guys, this is the go-to movie of the summer, and makes up for any disappointment you have seen this year or last.Just like Toy Story 2's subtle and underlying themes, Toy Story 3 revolves around the group of toys and their latest adventure, but dwells far deeper than that. On the surface, this movie is about the toys in a series of circumstances, winding up in a daycare center that isn't all it seems. At the same time, Andy is heading for college, but Woody isn't quite ready to let go of his owner and the memories that follow. The deeper aspects involve aging, growing up, and moving on. Michael Arndt, the Oscar winner that wrote Little Miss Sunshine, was behind the spectacular screenplay in this third trip in the world of toys. Then with the help of John Lasseter and Lee Unkrich (who serves as the director), we see plenty of references to Pixar, other movies, the previous Toy Story installments, and even we even see nods to the influences of the entire animation studio (Miyazaki).The writing wasn't the only thing that was on par with the first two Toy Story movies. The voice acting cast was once again phenomenal, with popular actors, underrated talent, and great character actors filling the bill. Come on now, just read em': Tim Allen, Tom Hanks, John Cusack, Wallace Shawn, Jody Benson, Estelle Harris, Blake Clark, John Ratzenburger, Ned Beatty, Jeff Garlin, and Michael Keaton. Unlike what Dreamworks pulls off on a yearly basis, Pixar carefully chooses their voice cast in terms of pulling off the best performances, not to generate more money. Because honestly, was there even a point to Angelina Jolie voicing the tiger in Kung Fu Panda? On the other hand, very few can pull an authentic Barbie like Jody Benson (a.k.a. Ariel in the Little Mermaid). It takes reliable and authentic acting to pull at the heartstrings, and everyone definitely was on their A-game.Lee Unkrich directed this movie with incredible pacing and just as much heart and dedication as Lasseter, who was in charge of the first two. The truth is, Pixar directs the movie together, as they share ideas and suggestions amongst each other. This fact can be traced to the similar pacing and directing styles seen in Pixar's better works like Ratatoille, Finding Nemo, and Up. They all have the similar technique of incorporating just as many tears as laughs. But unlike all the other Pixar movies (with the exception of The Incredibles), Toy Story 3 has a heave dosage of suspense and peril, which is climaxed by one of the most exciting animated sequences this side of Castle in the Sky (a Miyazaki adventure masterpiece). Other reviewers have noted this before me, but this Toy Story is quite scary in depth and in imagery at some instances, so be wary of this while watching this with the kids. With so much time invested with these toys, the drama runs a bit high.Bottom Line: Toy Story 3 secures its place in cinema brilliance by becoming the best third installment since Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, the best sequel since Kill Bill Vol. 2, and the best movie we've seen this year. This movie is usually hilarious, sometimes thrilling, and sometimes downright tear-jerking. And yes, just like Up's opening 10 minutes, there is that one major sequence in which Pixar will play with your heartstrings like Eric Clapton playing tears of Heaven. If you enjoyed the first two Toy Stories, there's no need to worry about the third and hopefully final chapter in the quality-filled saga. How Pixar manages to deliver yet again is absolutely beyond me.Walt Disney may not be one-hundred percent proud of his company if he were alive to see it now, but he would be absolutely delighted at seeing what beautiful art Pixar has delivered ever since 1995. Pixar has re-created Walt Disney 's magical methods of storytelling and movie-making, and arguably has taken it a step even further by adding depth to the characters and depth to the overall stories presented. The direction was fantastic, the writing was Oscar-worthy, and the overall production is Best Picture caliber. This is Pixar's best work since Finding Nemo, and a must see by any means necessary. Despite my cynical nature, there's no way I can grade this any less than perfect. Just no way.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Perfect Tale of Adventure and Devotion,"Since I felt none of the other reviews here do the movie justice, I became compelled to write my own. It is the most inspired film I have ever encountered.The creators of Toy Story 3 have an imagination that is unparalleled. I cannot begin to compare any of the other animated movies that I have ever seen to it. It is a fantasy in an unconventional sense: aside from the talking toys, the environment and settings are typical; commonplace. Yet, the Pixar Team manages to cram every last drop of energy into the incredibly clever story and inventive plot devices out of just common household objects. The animation is so brilliant that it captures shading, lighting, and textures that have yet to be seen on film.Then, Toy Story 3 becomes a beautiful elaboration on the first two, with very clever character development. Its maturity of relationships is concise but witty: Woody, the wise sheriff, leading the other toys with courage and finesse; a spaceman winning the love of a cowgirl; the loyalty of the dog, slinky; the grumpy married potato and his devoted wife; the superficial relationship of Ken and Barbie; the broken spirit of a lost teddy bear. At the same time, Pixar uses a metaphor that is so strong that it drives the audience to love these characters with all of their hearts. It is a similar emotional complex to a happy puppy who is brought into a home and has nothing on its mind but playing with its youthful owners. But these toys never age, and as its owners, once in their playful youths, leave for work and college, these toys still know nothing more than their youth and happiness of living to one day play again. As you leave for work every morning, your dog doesn't know where you go. And every day, he does nothing more than pray that you come back to see him, every day waiting for you to bring out the ball again for a game of fetch.Finally comes Pixar's ability to integrate so many emotions - fear, love, action, and comedy, among others - with each having so much vigor in its own right, that the movie becomes a roller coaster of animation and adventure, wound together by the constant movement of setting and storyline, always keeping the audience guessing on what might happen next. It is a brilliant tale; a perfect movie for children and adults alike. I cannot wait to see it again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Simply brilliant!,"I was about 10 or 12 when I watched the first Toy Story in the cinema with my little brother and sister. We were all enchanted! Years later Toy Story 2 came out and it was a blast! Again we all went to the theater to see it and we were so thrilled and excited after the movie! Im 24 now, and just yesterday I was at the Bulgarian gala-premiere of the film. My brother was fortunate to win an invitation for two (he took a photo of himself with our small collection of Toy Story toys and sent it to the website), and we had the chance to see the third part on its first screening... and for the 1st time in 3D! No doubt that the animation is better than ever, the guys from Pixar constantly push the limits, but that's kinda natural for them. But still it feels like 100% Toy Story, with all the improvements, somehow I don't feel this 15-years-wide gap between the first and the third part.What matters more is the (Toy) Story itself! And it is just fantastic! I had really high expectations of this film and honestly, after seeing it, my expectations were surpassed! The plot is really emotional, with so many nostalgic moments... Being kinda grown-up myself, but doing my growing-up with the first two parts of Toy Story, I couldn't relate more with this one! I was really touched! I just wish the theater was empty. Then I could stop holding back my tears! And it's not just t the big story, but also all those little things that go on around it! I don't know how many of those references and gags were in the script and how many were put in there in the making process, but it's just amazing! Even if it's the most dramatic and the darkest of the 3 (as dark as Toy Story can get) the comedy is still there, and I was laughing out loud all the way through! It's a wild roller-coaster, and I'm not even sure who will have more fun with it, if it will be the kids, or their parents! There's just so much more in there for you to notice, admire and laugh at! And I'm sure that after watching the film again I'll find out even more! There's also a really neat Totoro cameo, and it's great of Pixar to pay homage to their old friend, Miyazaki san.The old lovable characters are all here, and they are joined by an army of new ones, and each one of them has his real personality and you can recognize in them characteristics of someone, both visually and with their attitude they express different things and you instinctively feel what these toys stand for. It's really funny to recognize in them some movie archetypes or features of people that you know.I realize that I just poured out tons of superlatives, but there's nothing else you can say about this film! It has everything! (And about how many 3rd parts you can say that?) The only thing I could criticize is that there is one really freaky baby-toy, that can give the creeps to the smaller kids, but it's done on a purpose and for me it was really an enjoyable touch to the atmosphere of the film.To wrap up this review, I will just say - Thank you, Pixar!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
I'm 19 years old... but wile watching I was a child again.,"I'm nineteen and I wasn't as enthusiastic about going to see this as I was when I was eight years old.I entered the theatre; the lights went out, the movie began, and after the first twenty seconds I was a child again. The laughter came often and natural. The story was even better then the previous two combined.I went to go see this with my seven year old nephew and if I laughed that much when I was his age I know I had a good childhood. The mix of humour and emotion mad this movie one of the best I have ever seen, including big ones like Godfather and Shawshank.This movie is both hard and easy to review because you try to look at the down sides to the movie but the hard part is that there isn't any. I'm sure if you shut off your emotions you could see a fault of two but when it comes to an animated trilogy this is by far the most enjoyable time you can spend in a theatre... The best part, you can bring your kids.I can't vote... in my opinion ten isn't enough!",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Fitting ending to a great trilogy,"It is refreshing to see a third movie in a trilogy that's just as good if not better than the previous ones.Such is the case with Toy Story 3 that continues the story of Woody and Buzz and all their friends. Time has come for Andy to go to college and the toys are yet again faced with the crisis of abandonment. It amazes me that Pixar has managed to tell pretty much the exact same story three times now yet it always feels fresh. Because the story really is always the same. Something happens to the toys that makes them fear they're going to be cast aside or forgotten, this fear leads them to overreact, which causes complications, adventures happen and in the end they've learned a lesson and everything turns for the better. It's like clockwork, it's that predictable, but strangely I don't mind. The circumstances do change and the story always changes a little bit, but I still think it would have been annoying if not for the iron tight storytelling of Pixar's finest.A large part of it is also the fact that Toy Story is a very heavily character-driven franchise. And the characters do evolve. From Buzz and Woody becoming friends to the addition of new characters to the loss of old ones, the characters grow up along with us. And that doesn't change here. This movie has some of the best character moments in the whole trilogy and it's a fitting conclusion to their saga. Pretty much all the voice actors reprise their roles and they're as great as always.My only real gripe about this film is the ending. I know a lot of people love it, but I think most of those people are a bit younger than I am. I'm a 90s kid and I grew up with Disney. I only started watching these movies as an adult. Whereas those kids that grew up in the 00s and with Pixar have a much more nostalgic relationship with the Toy Story characters. So for them the ending is a real tearjerker. For me it's one of the corniest things I've ever seen. I know what they were going for and for their target audience it very well might have been the exact right call, but it still doesn't remove the fact that my jaw literally dropped when I saw Andy acting the way he did. No 17-year-old I have ever met, seen or heard of would act that way in real life. Yes, it's a movie and allowed to take liberties, but you see the problem I'm having, right?Nevertheless, it's a great movie. At times it's surprisingly dark, but never in a way that feels threatening or unnecessary. And it's always warmhearted, gentle, mature and uplifting. It's the perfect way to end this story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Toy Story 3 2010 Review,"""Well, whatever happens at least we'll be together ... For infinity and beyond.""
The final 30 minutes of this film are picture perfect, extremely emotional, and pretty mature. It's hands down the best part of the film, and even if you haven't seen the previous Toy Story films, the final act is bound to make you cry no matter what.Now, that being said I didn't really find the rest of this super engaging.The new toys are cool and all, Lotso in particular was a really good character and antagonist, but I never felt the same charm I felt with Toy Story 1 and 2 whenever watching this.I feel like the plot can be pretty forgettable and plain, and nothing super notable happens until those last 30 minutes.(I honestly really didn't like Spanish Buzz, I thought it was a really overdone gag and overstayed it's welcome.)All in all this isn't a bad film, I think it's definitely my least favorite Toy Story though, it just feels alittle lackluster until that final act. And boy does that final act hit hard.This would've been a very well done finale to the Toy Story trilogy, but then we got Toy Story 4, and from what I can remember I actually liked it more than this film weirdly enough.""So long ... partner.""",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Nutshell Review: Toy Story 3,"It was in 1995 that Toy Story signaled the arrival of Pixar, and the rest was history. To date, I have personally always found myself to have enjoyed all of their outputs, and it does seem that Pixar has indeed grown from strength to strength with sophistication in its graphics and attention to detail, but more so that their creative teams have always come out with solid stories to tell, which is always the key beneath all the glossy bells and whistles visuals.And I simply love this installment, not only because it reunites us with the characters whom we have taken to heart as old friends, welcoming them back to yet another big screen outing, but because it has a moving story to tell, and has various elements from action-adventure, comedy and drama all rolled into one, allowing an outpour of a kaleidoscope of emotions as we journey for close to 2 hours with Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz (Tim Allen), Jessie (Joan Cusack), Mr and Mrs Potato Head (Don Rickles and Estelle Harris), Hamm (John Ratzenberger), Res (Wallace Shawn), Slinky Dog (Blake Clark) and the aliens (Jeff Pidgeon) for one last hurrah.The storyline for all three Toy Story films may share some similar plot lines in having the constant fear of being discarded and unwanted when one turns old, or to obsess with the thought of being forgotten and unappreciated, and almost always comes with a distance to conquer. That continues here in stronger terms given that it's been some 11 years since the last Toy Story film, and that the toys' owner Andy has already outgrown the toys and have chucked whatever's left all into a treasure chest. Making things worst, he's about to relocate to attend college, and thus the anxieties that Woody, Buzz and the rest of the gang has to come to terms with, being provided 4 options of heading for the trash, the attic, being given away or being that rare toy that gets to accompany Andy to his new environment.New toys get introduced by way of how the story got crafted involving a children's day care centre, where we get to meet up with the over-emphasized, metrosexual Ken (Michael Keaton!) from Barbie (Jodi Benson), and others such as the Lotso bear (Ned Beatty), together with those belonging to a new human character called Bonnie (Emily Hahn) who owns a cool plush Totoro (which doesn't speak of course)! Sequels tend to overcrowd their stories with plenty of characters, but it worked perfectly for this installment as other than those which get lines, there are plenty in the background that you may just spot a few that you too may have owned at some point in time. Things also aren't quite what they seem at the day care being the paradise for toys in constantly being played with and loved but never to suffer a heartbreak or to be left feeling unwanted, and provides the basis upon which the story develops, providing plenty of challenges for the gang to overcome (gotta love that Monkey!)What's powerful about Toy Story 3 are the themes that get thrown in, such as that about loss, and the search and fight for things that are worthwhile. It emphasizes the bonds of friendship and courage, while tackling how the lack thereof in abandonment and the feeling of tremendous loss, can someone turn one into a bitter soul, which allowed for the film to take on tragic, darker consequences unseen in the earlier installments, while balancing the light hearted moments. We get to grow with the familiar characters a little more, while having new ones which are just as fun. Just ask Ken!And a word of caution - prepare those tissues and hankies! Parting is such sweet sorrow, and the manner in which director Lee Unkrich deals with will definitely tug at your heartstrings. At least two scenes got to me, one involving facing a consequence of inevitable hopelessness that is a definite edge of your seat stuff only to remind you of how much you really care for the characters, while the other was what I deem as the perfect send off, an au revoir fit for closing the chapter on this Toy Story arc, while leaving room for another to happen (if it does). It moved, and shows how valuable it is to be loved again, and I thought it was pitch perfect. It would be interesting to know how the creators had intended to end the story, but it was brilliant to have chosen with what was.Toy Story 3 is a must see, and it's contending for a space in my top 10 for the year. It's a sequel done right, a tale with a lot of heart, with elements encompassing what essentially is a fitting tribute and farewell to beloved characters that have blazed the trail for computer generated animation to take centerstage. As with all PIxar feature films, a short precedes the main feature, and ""Day and Night"", like the one offered in Up, comes without dialogue, but with plenty of imagination and again, a solid story for a well animated short film that only Pixar can.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Above an animation,"Toy Story 3, perhaps the best animation made in cinema history has been, because after seeing this animation, each viewer feel that the characters of interest. The animation really neutral in terms of content and is unique. When you see that, like see professionals movie.Toy story 3 is not well a certain age-specific, anyone can see and enjoy.Other benefits include the animation can be pointed sense of unity and friendship.I think this animation become win best picture in this year.You can see anything in this animation, emotions, courage, love, comedy, action, drama and .... together.

Pixar does it again,"As a 28 year old single female lawyer, i have always enjoyed Pixar's movies. I cannot label them as cartoons as there is nothing cartoonish about their stories; they have heart, meaning, feel-goodness with the right touch of class & humor. The formula is A1 yet without feeling overused.Toy Story 3 is once again a hit. We are treated to our favorite familiar characters and reminded again why we like them so. They are heroes who share the same values of team spirit, bonding and camaraderie. No one gets left behind. The technical aspects are again flawless. This is one series of sequels i do not mind seeing for Toy Story 4, 5, 6...this is coming from someone who adamantly refused to watch Toy Story 1 & 2 and UP..up and until last week i forced myself to..and i was so blown away by all three i have never been gladder to be proved wrong.Watch this, and Pixar, don't stop making movies for us.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Im glad I wasn't the only adult who cried haha,"I went in with HIGH hopes and i was not disappointed! The first toy story movie was by far my favorite movie as a child, i literally watched it two or three times a day. Im emotionally attached to the toy story movies so this movie felt like the closing chapter to my childhood. Aside from my emotional attachment this movie was still amazing! I laughed, which is expected since its the all might pixar. But i also cried...i was kinda embarrassed haha. I was holding back the tears in this one scene but since i don't want to spoil anything so ill stop there.

Best animated movies ever made,Toy Story 3 in my opinion is by far the best of the trilogy! It is the most emotionally investing out of all the Toy Story installments and is an outstanding entry to the Pixar library!,,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Succeeds In Living Up To Expectations,"Well, this lived up to the hype, which usually isn't an easy accomplishment. Toy Story 1 & 2 set the bar high so, frankly, I was expecting a disappointment with this one. Thankfully, it didn't happen. ""Toy Story 3"" was another amazing story in this (so far) trilogy.With a bunch of reviews already here, there is no sense going into the story. For those who haven't seen it yet, three surprises stood out for me: (1) the high number of new characters introduced; (2) the darkness of some of them; this is not always a fun story; (3) the incredibly-touching last 15-or-so minutes.All three of these facets should make this a fun 103 minutes every time I watch the DVD, much like the first two. Also, the artwork is at the usual high standard, especially some scenes in the last half hour at the dump yard, of all places.Finally, what's really cool, too, is that the people who voice the main characters are still the same men and women who did the first two films, with the exception of Jim Varney (""Slinky Dog""), who died in 2000. It's great to still hear familiar and distinctive voices, such as those of Wallace Shawn (""Rex""), John Ratenzenber (""Hamm""), Don Rickles and Estelle Harris (""Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head, respectively).Kudos to all those involved in making this film. They nailed the essence of ""Toy Story"" and how much loyalty can mean.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Still a fun Pixar effort, but the weakest of the Toy Story films.","I know, I know... I'm sure I'm going to get destroyed over this review. Anything under eight stars for a Pixar movie is blasphemy! While I thought TS3 was an entertaining two hours... it just wasn't quite up to par with the first two entries from the trilogy.The opening and ending dealing with Andy growing up and the toys outliving their usefulness to their owner was well done Pixar heartstring tugging... no complaints there. The middle act, which boiled down to a prison break movie, was a bit dull despite all the Pixar eye-candy trying to convince me otherwise. There were some gags to be had, a funny turn by Potato Head needing to use real vegetables, some thin and obvious (but still humorous) banter between Barbie and Ken and the now required shtick of Buzz Lightyear getting reset to various memory-wiped settings... but in general the middle 60 minutes of the film just seemed oddly disconnected from the rest. The end result was an odd sandwich effect, with the bread on either end actually being much more enjoyable then the meat in the middle.While I'm certainly not trying to slag the movie, I don't think 7/10 is anything approaching a hatchet job, I found this one to be clearly a level below the two films that preceded it. Pixar didn't waste the magic they built up with TS1 / TS2... but they certainly didn't expand on it either.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Thank you, Pixar.","I left the theater in 1995 after seeing the original Toy Story strangely moved. I was only six years old, and I'm not sure I had even fully grasped the revolutionary CGI for what it was (it probably just registered as animation to me, and I didn't quite understand its impact), but I did know – at least on a basic level of storytelling – that it was fantastic. Four years later I went to see the sequel with my younger sisters and felt the exact same way I had the first time. Even at a fairly young age I knew there was something special about these films.Many times nostalgia has to compensate for quality (or lack thereof) in your perception of entertainments as you age. Suddenly Mac and Me isn't as awesome as you once found it to be. You revisit films from your childhood and learn to appreciate them based solely on the memories they conjure up, trying to block out the reality that, hey, This kinda sucks.That never happened with the Toy Story movies. As I grew older, as I saw them more and more times, they only seemed to improve. New layers appeared – adult humour that I never appreciated when I was ten but suddenly blindsided me. Characters that revealed new depths; emotional scenes that only became increasingly poignant and meaningful, like that amazing scene where Buzz first becomes aware of his own mortality as a toy that can't really fly, or when he learns to cope with that fact by embracing the fact that he can instead fall rather well (with style).The point of this rambling trip down memory lane is that Toy Story, the whole legacy of it, means a lot to me. I grew up with these pictures and never tired of returning to them, and they were always there for me like a good friend is. I approached Toy Story 3 with the slightest of reservations, fully trusting Pixar, and yet wondering how they could possibly produce anything that would live up to such high standards.Well, suffice to say, they did it – if Toy Story 3 isn't the best of the series, then that's merely because it comes eleven years after the last one and it hasn't been given some time to work its full magic on us. This is every bit as engaging, heartwarming and funny as the first two films – but it's also the saddest, most human and most moving.The plot has already been outlined by other critics, so I don't feel a need to recap anything. Nor do I want to inadvertently spoil any key moments (and please, for your own sake, avoid reading too much about the movie before going to see it – some reviewers are a bit too keen on giving away the ending, although it's understandable given how surprisingly emotional it is).The introduction of new characters is seamless – Ken (voiced by Michael Keaton) is hilarious but thankfully not overused, and the other assorted variety of toys, including Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear (Ned Beatty), are fine additions to the series.And Woody and Buzz (Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, respectively) pick up right where they left off, and you feel, in a weird way, like you're visiting old pals. The movie features the best animation of the trilogy, and the second half – which is darker than the two previous installments – makes excellent use of lighting and cinematography. The climactic finale is incredibly intense (especially for a ""kids movie"") and features particularly impressive visuals. Many reviewers have noted that they cried during the finale, and even I must admit that I came pretty close.In a summer full of bores, disappointments and under-achievers, Toy Story 3 is not merely the first thoroughly satisfying motion picture of the season – it's the only truly moving one. It is fairly ironic, perhaps, that we must turn to movies about pieces of plastic to find such poignant reflections upon human nature, but then again, I'm not sure I'd want to have it any other way.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Prison break for kids,"As I sit here the day after my wedding Toy Story 3 was an interesting movie to put on. I´m tired, been up for way too long and just want to relax, so what about a very emotional movie right after a very emotional day for me.Toy Story 3 is such a weird movie to talk about as it has some of the strongest emotional scenes of the entire franchise but at the same time is a weird prison break movie. What were the creators thinking when making this? This is the sendoff for the franchise, even though it continued afterwards- The emotions run high and the humour runs okay as Toy Story go to kindergarten!After hearing Andy is going to colleague, the toys that are left think they are being thrown away. This leads them to be given to a school, but not everything is as it seems at the relaxing daycareWhat surprised me a lot about this movie is its premise and ideas compared to the previous instalments. While I feel like they delt a lot about self-discovery and reflective journeys, this movie is only half that comparably. This is more of a genre movie, a prisonbreak one and less about the growth of the characters, even though that is also important later for the characters. This makes the movie feel a bit less like its predecessors for better and worse. While it can feel like its own it can also feel detached at the same time. I don´t really know why they went for that.The emotional moments in this movie hits very hard. The beginning and especially the entire third act is devastating and feels like a perfect send off for the characters even though it kind of wasn´t in the long run. What this movies touches about growing up and what happens to toys, generations, abandonments, trauma and fait are all touched on beautifully here. The fake out ending and the actual ending are two truths that all fit the mould and would have worked since that is the faiths of our childhood companies.The animation here looks incredible, again the different movements and styles from the different toys are so unique like you are supposed to, the overall look of everything is smooth and everything moves smooth too. Even though this movie doesn't look as good as the fourth instalment, it still looks absolutely incredible and really shows Pixar's journey, compared to the two previous movies.I think the humour is mixed here. Some work, some don´t but it´s more about the emotions here, but that only takes up so much of the movie. The acting is great for everything here but again the weird mix of drama, humour and serious emotions plus the genre shifts makes the movie feel a bit jarring.While I like this movie and will forever finds it´s emotional parts incredible it´s just a mixed bag for me. The sum of its parts are all great but it just already here stopped feeling like a Toy Story movie and just another entry in a franchise. While this is movie is important to me, it will never hit the same beats as its predecessors that feels so much more compact to what it was supposed to compared to this, that feels like it should have been a short movie by its parts but has an entire other movie slapped on top of it to have runtime. Again, not a bad movie, just not a Toy Story movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Escape from Camp Deadly (3 days Screen Marathon),"I thought i would have fun but this movie is a bit depressive: toys from our childhood discarded, torture camp for them, burning hell! It's very intense for a cartoon and it frightened indeed my five years old nephews. Thus, the people behind it failed their job.As an adult, i don't agree with the starting point: when we grow up, we don't throw away our toys. Personally, those toys have built my identity and if they are actually locked, they are saved for my future children.OK, you will say that this movie is not the point of view of the child but of its toys. But showing that they are discarded is actually a very sad, unhappy way to consider life. That's not the lesson i want to teach my children.Life is a great joy foremost and the opening sequence of the movie is the only good moment I remember: Life is imagination and imagination is all and is best used with happy thoughts!",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Blew me away,So I'm 26 and jaded. I most often hate the world and everything in it. Well that being said I absolutely lost myself watching this movie. I had seen the two before it as a kid growing up but I never felt so strong about them as I do with this one. I have spent the last couple weeks after seeing this movie spreading the word about how awesome it was. The theme is so universal that anyone despite their background or feelings can absolutely relate. We've all been to that place were we feel like we've been used and that were done with. The feeling as if we have nowhere to go or anyone to turn to. I really want everyone to experience the overwhelming feelings that boiled inside of me as this movie came to an end. The second the toys held hands at one point my face absolutely exploded and from there it didn't relent. Seriously I could not breathe it was almost to much. But its not. Go see it.

Could be the best of the series,"Toy Story 3 could be the best movie of the series. I've enjoyed all the movies but TS3 had a little something extra that really got to me.I remember as a kid how I felt inanimate objects had feelings, so I really related to Andy and how he felt about his toys, especially Woody.With TS3 I remembered how it felt when my oldest went off to college. It is such a bittersweet moment. You want your kids to grow and move on, it is what life is, but part of you wishes they'd stay Andy's age in TS1 forever.I won't go on because I'd get into spoilers, but I just love this movie.

Pixar's Best Movie And Truly A Masterpiece,"Is ""Toy Story 3"" good? Yes, it is. Is it exciting? Yes. Is the animation good? Excellent. Is it worth the money? It's worth. Is it better than the previous two? Much, much better. ""Toy Story 3"" is an excellent movie for all ages.First, the animation. The moves of the characters are simply perfect. Ken and Barbie, they're robotic moves are so breathtaking. The moves are simply so detail and mesmerizing.The appearances. Not much to talk about. But, the appearances of the characters were perfectly designed. The main characters were really cool. Ken and Barbie, they're really designed in detail. For Barbie, the line where is visible in the neck was really detail. Ken is also really detail especially with his body. Lot-o-Huggin'-Bear was also carefully designed by the paper which often appears on dolls listing the warning or whatever.The way the movie is presented. Very well done. In around 90 minutes of running time (excluding ""Day & Night""), the movie was not boring at all. It had some laughable expressions which are pretty funny. I liked it when Buzz turns into Spanish mode where most of the audience laughed. That moment was hysterical. The scenes were also thrilling like the end scene (which I'm not going to tell you) or the scenes in Sunnyside. I thoroughly enjoyed the film.The new characters. Well, I think there's one negative point. I think little kids around the age of 3, 4 or 5 might be scared with the appearance of Big Baby, because, his appearance is kind of scary for little kids.The 3D effects. Not so cheesy and not so breathtaking but pretty good. The depths of the items in the film were not bad.The sound acting. They were really good. Tom Hanks on Woody was really good. He really projected his voice until he becomes a real Woody. Tim Allen on Buzz Lightyear was also good and satisfying. He really sounded like a real astronaut or space ranger. The others were also good. But, I think Tom Hanks on Woody still has the best projection of voice in the film.Final thing, the short film attached to it: ""Day & Night"". It was shockingly, awfully, crazily cool. That short film was quite funny. It was really good. Overall, the short film compliments to the film to be a very good movie.A short advise, you might want to prepare some tissues to wipe your tears as there are some pretty sad moments in the film. The scenes were just so sad that that's another praise for Lee Unkrich on his directing. So, if you don't prepare those tissues, I hope you have something you can use to wipe your tears.As an amazing end to such a magnificent trilogy, ""Toy Story 3"" is a must watch movie. Watching it in 3D is not a bad choice. Your kids will definitely be thrilled watching this film. I truly believe this is the best animated film of the year, or even the best film of all 2010 films. If you haven't watched this yet, what are you waiting for? Go purchase your tickets and enjoy this masterpiece. I guarantee you that you won't regret watching this movie.Overall, I give this movie a perfect score of 10 stars. I wish a fourth installment would be made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Toy Story 3...never disappoints,"When I heard that Toy Story 3 was coming out, I felt two things: excitement and worry. Why the worry? Because despite Pixar's consistency with making fantastic films, I didn't want Toy Story's reputation to be marred by a slump in the franchise (Indiana Jones 4 anyone?).All these worries went away when I saw the film. It really is hilarious, and really tense in parts! It had everyone in the cinema genuinely cracking up. For me, it was a much better film than Toy Story 2, and I liked Toy Story 2 a lot.It's always great to catch up with gangs of characters as likable as these toys. I'm glad that they had material that was consistently hilarious throughout the movie and didn't just have a cop-out story to get more money from the franchise (again, Indiana Jones).One thing to note is how touching this movie is as well - people in the cinema were genuinely crying and upset. I don't cry at films, but this had me very close indeed.Anyhow, go to see this movie! You won't be disappointed and will laugh throughout. It's suitable for children and adults alike. :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pixar has done it again!,"I saw the cliffhanger version at my college yesterday and I must say that I'm thoroughly impressed by it! Pixar knows how to keep the story fresh, and entertaining. They kept the entire crowd laughing every other moment, and mixing in gasps of fear whenever anything happened to the main characters. The visual effects are simply stunning, like nothing you've ever seen before, with lots of great cinematography. Even though we didn't get to see the end, they still gave us enough of the story to make it very satisfying. There are plenty of classic Pixar references so keep your eyes peeled for those. I will definitely be at theaters on June 18 to find out how this amazing saga will end!",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
the only thing it really has standing against it is the fact that it inevitably invites comparison with the first and second entries of the trilogy,"We've all been craving for a third and final hurrah with Woody and Buzz and all of their plastic friends for eleven years now and at last we've been delivered what we've been asking for, to a certain degree. Now, don't start getting worried, folks. I am most certainly *not* trying to warn you off of seeing ""Toy Story 3."" On the contrary, I am *insisting* that you go to see this marvelously-animated, refreshingly fun, and surprisingly moving little gem not just because it is the third and final installment of one of the most beloved sagas of all time, but because it's simply a great movie. All I am saying is that it does not sit on the same tier to the original 1995 ""Toy Story"" or the even greater ""Toy Story 2"" released in 1999. But again, how many films do? Very few.Some time has passed since ""Toy Story 2"" and things are vastly changing for Woody (voice of Tom Hanks), Buzz (voice of Tim Allen) and their friends. Their owner, Andy is all grown up and heading off to college. Many of their friends have since been sold away or broken and the toys are fearing the same outcome for themselves. By mishap, they end up being whisked away to a daycare center, that is, when the humans are not around, run by a purple stuffed bear (voice of Ned Beatty) who later turns out to not be so cute and cuddly. Once again Woody is the hero trying to set things right as he not only strives to return to Andy before he heads off to college, but save his friends from torture and, possibly, destruction.There is a lot to praise about ""Toy Story 3."" Starting with the ostensive elements, it is a great-looking movie. The animators, because of a computer glitch, had to rebuild their characters and settings from scratch and you wouldn't know the difference. The animation is marvelous and inventive with a vast array of colors. The movie is fun to look at and is most certainly fun to watch.The real strength of the ""Toy Story"" trilogy has been in its story. So many movies these days look great, but the visual appeal is badly welded around stories that aren't worth a dime. The trilogy has stood out because of strong stories and characterizations that make you really feel for some individuals are really nothing more than just animated plastic, even in their own world and universe. We go to the level of these toys instead of going with the cliché of staying on the human level and look down upon them. And they have gotten more mature as they have gone along. The first movie's story was about a toy fearing being replaced or forgotten. The sequel dealt with the anticipation that such a thing could happen soon and the third resolves with the actual event of a toy being abandoned by its owner. I don't want to give too much away, because this story starts out strong when we learn that some of the recurring characters from before will not be featured this time around, and it works out to one of the most poignant and genuinely moving culminations of recent years. I was tearing up at the end and I guarantee you many others in the theater I was in were too.If ""Toy Story 3"" does have anything countering against it, it is the inevitable fact that people will compare and contrast it to the first two movies, which are more complete on a psychological level, and superior as motion pictures and storytelling. By itself, it is a more than fine movie, but we do have a certain tendency to expect the best because Pixar made the lightning strike the top of the tower twice before. And not only with the other two movies in this saga, but with gems such as the recent spellbinder ""Up.""Despite a few complaints, I immensely enjoyed ""Toy Story 3"" and I more than happily recommend it to everybody. Although it does not have the same level of heart and awe that the first two movies had, it is a more than satisfactory conclusion to this trilogy and without a doubt the best movie that I have seen in a theater this year. The ""Toy Story"" movies are three genuinely enthralling motion pictures. They are the Mount Everest of modern-day animation because they not only look good, but have strong characters and strong stories. And once again, I must reflect upon how my heartstrings were tugged at without remorse when that beautiful ending came along. It's been a long time since a movie has done that to me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Toy Story 3,"I would the Toy Story series overall as a series and as a fun story to watch with my kids as they have grown up. It hits home with me because when the series first came out I too was a kid going to see this with my mom and my sisters so I can relate to being a kid and seeing the film. With that being said, the story is fun but it's drying out the more the series goes on. It's another set of toys that realize that their original owner no longer wants them. Particularly because they are growing it. I get thats the point but that's what last film was about.

Granted it some good moments but it was just dark and unpleasant. Cars 2 get's hated while I like it. This get's liked while I hate it. Cars 2 get's hated because they say it was so much darker than the 1st. But this is twice as violent. Granted the last 2 films weren't all whimsical but in the last two did you see the toys getting tortured?! No! This simply does not happen! When did ""You've got a friend in me,"" turn into ""Burn alive, burn until you rot in hell!"" When did that happen?! Is there something I missed in the last 2? Do I have an abridged DVD? Somebody tell me when the last 2 films were as dark as this! I'm sorry but this film is horrible! I still don't understand why so many people liked it.

One of the greatest achievements in movie history.,"Just how good is ''Toy Story 3'', you ask? It's simply one of the greatest achievements in movie history, I answer. This film, right now, should win the Oscar for Best Picture, hands down. I honestly doubt there'll be a better film than this all year. That's how absolutely brilliant this movie is. Pixar is officially king of everything! This movie is smart funny, thrilling, engaging, and, most importantly, it taught me about friendship. It taught me to stick by my friends, no matter what. The final sequences of the movie are absolutely breathtaking, and I couldn't help but shed a few tears. It doesn't feel like you're watching an animated movie. In some scenes it feels like you're watching an Alfred Hitchcock film, due to the great thrills, and others you can't help but cry over due to the togetherness of the whole gang. One of the film's themes is obviously never give up. This film can really inspire you. This film is also about loss and letting go. Who knew a film about toys could have such true themes on life. This is a masterpiece, one that once again pulls you in with the characters from the second it starts. Don't go see the grotesque Adam Sandler comedy ''Grown Ups'', or the action flick ''Knight and Day''. Go see this. This film is about a quintillion light years better than both those films. This beats, as great as they were, the first two ''Toy Story'' films. It beats them by a lot, actually. Take your family to go see this, but also, if you're an adult, go see this with adult friends. This is a film to go see with friends. This is the best from the greatness that is Pixar. 10 out of 10, a miraculous, comedic, inspiring, joyful, entertaining, adventurous, smart, tear jerking, and enduring film to cherish until the end of time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"few trilogies can be considered whole and complete, but this is now one of them","Toy Story 3 brings back nostalgia, but that's to be expected. We all think back to fifteen years ago, or eleven years ago, when the Toy Story movies came out the first time. If you're too young for that, then at least the re-release was last year to catch people up, though it's not quite the same thing. As Andy is off to college- as was predicted would happen as a given in Toy Story 2- we in the audience realize that this third film follows a kind of time-line that runs with our lives. Even if you're an adult (i.e. older than my 20-something age) you can relate to what the toys and Andy are going through. What happens at the end of the film, the resolution of the ultimate conflict of what to do with the toys as life goes on, is one of the most beautiful and heartwarmingly bittersweet (well, more like sad-sweet) moments in recent cinema. Pixar tends to do that.This is the kind of third movie that makes it a trilogy- it's hard to see it going on to a fourth film and having any kind of the same resonance- and one that seems perfectly fit together in terms of a progressing story. But where something like Star Wars saw the second film as the darkest and third one coming into (somewhat) lighter terms, this is not quite the same with Pixar's baby. Toy Story 3, with it becoming a prison movie in more than just a sense (the toys get sent to Sunnyside Daycare, run by a cute-looking but ruthless bear voiced by Ned Beatty), and what happens in said prison. To be sure, other cute things abound in the movie, from Peas-in-a-Pod to (yes) Totoro from Miyazaki's movie. But in that prison, and other things that happen such as the trip to the junkyard/landfill, it gets dark.And yet, Pixar continues their outstanding method of storytelling and entertainment: nothing is even scaled-down for kids, and nothing is too sappy for adults. A couple of obvious song choices aside- 'Dream Weaver' for when Ken and Barbie first meet, and 'Freak Out' as Ken hilariously tries on a wardrobe- there's nothing that doesn't work for kids and adults, equally, and often more-so for adults than kids (I wonder, for example, when Buzz is reset and becomes El Buzzo and speaks Spanish if the wee little ones will be able to read the subtitles). When it's funny the humor is aimed at sophisticated one-liners and, yes, sophisticated (or just well-timed) slapstick, when there's action it's intense just as in the previous Toy Stories, and when it's heartbreaking it'll make everyone in the audience cry. I wonder if Pixar has some kind of magic movie-voodoo to get the old adage to come alive: you'll laugh, you'll cry- and sometimes in the same breath!The new toys are great additions, but they never detract from the classic cast. And even with them, and the great dynamic of the daycare center and its prison atmosphere, we never get lost in the shuffle of toy conflicts and desires and dreams halted (Lotso's backstory is like a twisted version of Jessie's story from Toy Story 2). It would also be a given to say that the animation keeps getting better, a little higher quality in stylization and panache, but the animators and filmmakers also aim higher in a number of ways. The opening of the film, with its grand depiction of what's going on inside of Andy's mind as he plays with his toys, an Old West-Sci/fi hybrid complete with a train full of troll orphans and Hamm as a giant flying pig-spaceship-weapon, is so epic as to seem like it's out of a much bigger Summer Action Blockbuster than it should be. Or rather, Toy Story IS this summer's big Blockbuster, and it's epic enough to be qualified as a kind of mini-masterpiece - that is, until the rest of the film unfolds.At the least, Buzz dancing to Spanish Salsa music, and that end of the movie, make it one of the high points of Pixar's career - and this is following WALL-E and Up!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"""Toy Story 3"" It's Not Goodbye, It's See You Later.and That's Not a Tear!","I randomly wonder if the Toy Story trilogy created any hoarders, because if I were a child and saw these films, I'd become a hoarder—just sayin'.The complaint that I see through many reviews is that the animation isn't adequate. Really? Pathetic excuse for people that claim to love movies. Ick.Pixar makes me feel good without making me feel guilty. Thank you seems so small in comparison to what they've given and as saccharin as this sounds; it's true. It's so hard to get a close to wholesome experience at a film in today's industry and Pixar can be trusted to do just that. Their films are wholesome because they do their darnest to make them so and families appreciate that more than they probably will ever know.I wondered how they were going to get to Sunny Side and the film sets it up perfectly. Like dominoes falling one after the other the things that go wrong have the toys end up at the day care only to want to go back home. Perfect display of story creation is taking a simple concept and squeezing an amazing adventure out of it. Many themes run through the film such as feeling unwanted, misunderstandings, bullying, jail break/escape, and then the wonderful reunited moment.The Toy Story Gang is back sans Bo Peep and I'm not as sure as to why. Maybe there's an interesting story in there somewhere or I missed the explanation in the film. There are so many great moments that I can't pick one. The Ken (Michael Keaton) and Barbie (Jodi Benson) moments were so cheesy they were awesome. They were cheesy in an 80's kind of way. Plastic perfect, if you ask me. Buzz (Tim Allen) and Jessie (Joan Cusack) connect in an adorable manner. Her infatuation with him while he's stuck in Spanish mode had her in a Latin heat mood smoldering in ways no one thought a little cowgirl doll could. Andy and Woody (I know, I know) have a strong connection that is shown in Toy Story and takes a great turn in beginning and even bigger one in the end.John Morris grew up with many of the viewers on Toy Story as Andy for all three movies. Random awesome factoid.If Toy Story 3 (and I'm only reminded of the Oscars cause of what I read in someone else's review) doesn't dominate the Oscars it would be a travesty. It is by far the best film of the year (thus far) and I'm sure that won't change too much this summer.The end of Toy Story 3 takes all of Toy Story history and makes the caring moviegoer, who supported the film from the onset in 1995 until now, break down and cry for toys. How incredibly gifted a storyteller are these people? This is why the bar will remain unbreached because they not only set it high, they make it insurmountable. The tears for the toys are more for what we all miss. It's the carefree feeling, the love for the simple and the power of imagination that is lost when we cross a certain threshold and nowadays the age gets younger and younger. When people watch Toy Story 3, not only are they a little shocked by the dark nature it takes on, they cry because of the goodbyes. They do so because they'd trade all of what they have in technology to have that mindset again. With the last scene the classic song playing, ""You got a friend in me"" Toy Story 3 ends in the most amazing way possible for a film that made us all believe that toys come to life the moment our backs are turned. Pixar has given what many creators of worlds wish to give and that's immortality engraved on the hearts of film lovers that'll last ""to infinity and beyond.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Just amazing,"After seeing Toy Story 1 and 2, they quickly became my favourite set of films ever and just last year when i heard there was going to be a 3rd, my heart immediately sank. As with sequels before, i thought it was going to be aimed at an entirely new audience, for the sake of profit and would squeeze the love i had for the series right out of it.Then i began to read about interviews and the plot line and how it continues from both previous films, with Andy just a child back then, he has now become a teenager ready for college. This got me a little excited and for the rest of the year building up to it i was looking more and more forward to it.Usually, walking out of cinema doors, i have a feeling of disgust and disgrace having just watched an awful film for a high price. So, it would have been safe to say my expectations for this film were ridiculously high, i mean there is not many series' of films that keep followers for 15 years.It felt like a mere 10 minutes that i had been in my seat when the film finished. I was on the verge of tears, had a huge smile on my face and almost felt the need to jump up and clap. There are few films like this out there, Toy Story 1 and 2 being the exceptions. It continued the story so well, you still had the same love for the main characters that you always did.For a film aimed at children, it had an amazing plot, that never confused but always kept you guessing. It is perfect for all ages, whether old or young, it is a magical story.My only criticism would be at the lack of characters from previous films. It was explained immediately whether they had been sold or lost but i really felt disappointed that some old favourites were missing.Still apart from that, the film was faultless. I recommend going immediately and watching it in 3D. Nothing really pops out in your face, but it is made really well to fit 3d.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Falling with Style Part 3,"Convinced that a now college-aged Andy intended to throw them out, his toys take refuge at a daycare centre with unexpectedly rough kids in this third film in the ""falling with style"" franchise. The movie tackles slightly different ideas to what we have seen before with Andy torn between moving on and hanging onto the toys he once cherished. There is also a magnificent sequence in which are treated to the detailed insides of a landfill station. For the most part though, the plot of 'Toy Story 3' bares such a strong resemblance to Parts One and Two that it never quite feels like a motion picture of its own. Once again, the story is propelled by the toys not believing and trusting Woody (as per the first film) before meeting an antagonist who initially appears friendly and jolly, which then leads to them making a daring escape (as per the second film). The antagonists in both the second and third film even meet with similar fates! The themes and issues are also strikingly familiar with owners who move on and toys who find themselves no longer wanted. The film does have novelties up its sleeve though. The Mr. Tortilla Head scenes are delightfully zany and the parody of prison escape movies works quite well. There are also some great new toys - even if they do not get a whole lot of screen time. Capped off with an emotionally charged finale (watch for Andy's face and eyes), it is easy to see why many have been won over by the charm of 'Toy Story 3', even if it does not pull in anywhere near as many new directions as the previous films.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
This movie didn't have any characters.,"I'm not sure why nobody else has noticed that this movie had no characters. It was incredibly disappointing to walk out of the theater realizing that this is the best movie of the summer and there were no meaningful interactions between the characters. Strangely enough, the appeal of the first movie was inverted; in Toy Story, we were surprised and delighted to see toys have emotions like human beings, and in Toy Story 3, we are apparently satisfied (duped?) into enjoying allegedly human personalities thrown around as toys.In the first movie, Woody is the hero and leader of the toys, then he meets Buzz and his personality is suddenly conflicted. Watching the tension between these characters build and break was legitimately interesting, a sort of Shakespearean kids' movie. It took the silly idea of animated toys and turned it into a real drama. Now, in the third movie, the drama is artificial and stupid; it comes from an outside evil force that has only a shallow personality and cannot be swayed. The main characters are only good people in a bad situation, which they need to get out of. THEY DID NOT DO ANYTHING TO GET INTO THIS SITUATION; their only duty is to escape. Nothing meaningful happens to them.In the first movie, too, the cognitive dissonance between ""toys being played with"" and ""toys acting up when nobody sees them"" was very small. Woody was the same person whether or not there were kids in the room. In the third movie, somehow there is a complete disconnect between these two behaviors. Woody is not really a toy, but a sort of soul-infused plastic man who is forced to be a full-time actor, who performs ""improv"" for the kids and needs to be ""in character"". The deep, unexplained longing of the toys for children to come back and play with them is more than a little creepy.In short, the metaphor of Toy Story is broken by this sequel, and no meaningful story is told. I would not show it to my kids. I'm sorry I watched it. Two stars for a decent ending scene.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"A definite change in direction for Pixar, but fantastic nonetheless.","So I saw Toy Story 3 tonight at an early screening here in Houston, TX. A little background info about me. I am a big, no HUGE, Pixar fan, I've watched every film that they have created dozens of times. Let me begin, this is definitely no Ratatouille, Wall-E, or Up. Pixar is definitely coming back to it's family roots and Toy Store 3 is extremely evident of that. Don't get me wrong, Pixar has completely outdone themselves once again offering a film that is extremely entertaining, thrilling, and fresh, but it is kind of disappointing that the film doesn't reach any true depth until the POWERFUL last act.I'm going to divide my review into several sections.Writing: The humor was straight up HILARIOUS. There were several scenes that had the audience ROTFL'ing, even I, as crude and bitter I may be when it comes to comedy, was laughing out loud at a few parts. However some jokes do fall flat into Dreamworks territory with potty humor (lincoln logs anyone?) which I hope does not become a recurrence, but overall the film had some wonderful writing and dialogue creating a truly believable setting and tone.Animation: It's truly a shame that some of the later scenes in the final act haven't been shown in the commercials because, DAMN, the detail is truly remarkable. Since this is a no spoiler review I won't move further into that but let me tell you now, you will be impressed. Humans are beginning to look more realistic with ton's of attention to movement and the toys have benefited from some spackle in the facial department in an attempt to create a more emotionally expressive character. While it didn't blow me away like Finding Nemo and Wall-E did when they released, the work done here by Pixar is truly solid and way above anything Dreamworks has brought to the table. The 3D is also decent, I'm not really buying into this whole fad because after a few minutes you don't notice the effect. The added depth is nice but you honestly won't be missing much if you watch it in a good quality cineplex.Sound: The theater I went to had a pretty weak sound system so I can't really comment on the effects but when it comes to voice talent, the actors truly shine. It was sad to see some characters go like Bo Beep and Squeaky but some of the new additions like Lotso and Ken, played by Ned Beatty and Michael Keaton, are some true standouts thanks to the excellent dialogue provided by the script. All the original characters once again do their job quite well and with the excellent editing and mixing, the dynamics of social interaction between the characters are expressed clearly.Depth/Theme: You know I was going here and I HAD to talk about it. Ratatouille had the whole analysis of segregation with ""Everyone can cook"", Wall-E brought environmentalism, consumerism, capitalism, and most importantly love to the table, while Up directly deals with death and the emotions that stem from it. Toy Story 3 repeats the abandonment and moving on angle from Toy Story 2 which is TRULY the film's weakest link. Not because the movie copies the second films moral, but because TS3 virtually ignored these themes until the last act which I will admit was quite compelling. It would have been nice to spread these serious moments throughout the film to create a balanced equilibrium but unfortunately this does not happen. However I do want to talk about this pivotal juncture in the final act, there was a moment in the movie that only last a minute or two, but felt very, very, very real. I can't stress this enough, I have never felt anything like this from a movie. The first time I cried in a move was with Up's ""Ellie"" sequence but for some reason I didn't do it here. My emotions went beyond crying, I don't know if it was the swirling bright ember colors contrasting with the stark images or the expressiveness of the toys in that very moment, but I sat there in disbelief and was affected in a way that has not existed before.Overall: I really do wish that Lee Unkrich could have spread the last 15 minutes throughout the movie but that didn't happen which is why I could not give this movie a 10, however, that last act SAVED this motion picture from being another run of the mill Dreamworks film. Aside from some of the lame toilet humor and disappointing direction choices, Toy Story 3 is a very solid conclusion to one of the best trilogies of all time that needs to experienced solely for the last beautifully gratifying act with the gang that I grew up with.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
*A Heartfelt Farewell - Toy Story 3's Stellar Tribute to Childhood*,"Toy Story 3 is a cinematic masterpiece that not only entertains but also tugs at the heartstrings, encapsulating the bittersweet essence of growing up and the inevitable passage of time.

Woody, Buzz Lightyear, and the gang find themselves grappling with the fear of abandonment as they confront their uncertain future.Pixar's storytelling prowess shines as Toy Story 3 delivers a perfect blend of humor, adventure, and tears. The introduction of the sinister yet captivating Lotso Bear and his gang of toys adds an intriguing conflict that raises the stakes for our beloved protagonists. As the plot unfolds, themes of friendship, loyalty, and the acceptance of change emerge, leaving viewers pondering the relationships they hold dear.What truly sets Toy Story 3 apart is its ability to evoke profound emotional responses. The film culminates in a heart-wrenching finale that resonates with anyone who has experienced the pangs of growing up. The iconic scene in the incinerator, where the toys face their greatest challenge, showcases not only their unbreakable bond but the universal fear of being forgotten.

The greatest three-quel of all-time to the greatest trilogy of all-time!,"I've seen a lot of disappointing three-quels in my days. Pirates 3, Shrek 3, Spidey 3, X-Men 3, Rush Hour 3, and much more. But this movie is not only a great three-quel but it could be the best three-quel of all time. Everything in this movie is excellent and I mean everything! It is dark, hilarious, clever entertaining, colorful, amusing but most of all it is very emotional, especially at the end. Thankfully, I did not cry on the outside but I cried a lot in the inside. Toy Story 3 is unforgettable and I am sad that there will never be another toy story movie but unfortunately it had to be ended. What a way to end a perfect movie and, I believe, the greatest trilogy of all-time. I am begging every single person to go see this movie instead of some crap like Prince of Persia, robin hood, the A team, or especially Jonah Hex. This is the best movie of the year and is the best movie of the decade... so far.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Toy Story 3,"Objectivity is never easy, but in judging Toy Story 3, it's an almost entirely pointless aspiration. I got my Woody and Buzz toys when I was six. I had those stylized clouds from Andy's room on my wallpaper. I was choking up when ""You've Got a Friend in Me"" started playing over the film's achingly nostalgic VHS opening.I could try and share my overwhelmingly positive and occasionally negative observations--the breakout scene pops with Chaplinesque inventiveness, while Jessie is a tad underserved by the screenplay etc--but for me, Toy Story 3 is defined by the fact that I was streaming tears literally non- stop for the last twenty minutes or so. If you occupy a similar space of hopeless subjectivity, Toy Story 3 will be one of the most moving and rewarding cinematic experiences of the year. -TK 11/16/10",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Not really for young children,"I note that most of these reviews (so far) have been from people who enjoyed the original Toy Story movies when kids, and who are now adults. For that group I completely agree that this is a great movie. It has grown along with them, and offers a deeper, darker and more emotional story. As an adult, I loved it.For exactly the same reasons though, as a father of young children I was a bit disappointed. My 5 year old son has watched the first two Toy Story movies countless times, and adores the characters. They are as relevant to him now as they were to others when they first came out. That being said, it's clear that Toy Story 3 was not made for him.First of all, it's scary. Not haw haw scary, but really scary. Be prepared to comfort a young child often. Secondly, a lot of the humour will go over a kid's head. It still has some great moments, but fewer than the first two films. There's a fairly long scene that involves subtitles, so kids who can't read yet are out of luck. Thirdly, it's long. At almost two hours there will likely be at least one bathroom break required.I would say the overriding emotion is pathos. It's basically a farewell to much loved characters, but young kids who have just discovered them recently may not be ready to say farewell.So it's a great movie, but possibly a misleading one for parents with young children. It's not as innocent as the first two, and may leave your kids more sad than happy. It's still worth taking your kids to, but maybe budget some ice cream for afterwards.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Toy Story 3 is not the breakout animated film of the year...,"How To Train Your Dragon is. I'll make it simple, as mystifying as my words may read. Toy Story was a good movie; not because it was original - The Brave Little Toaster has the honor of that. No, and not just because it's characters are memorable and the movie is entertaining, which are all true. But what is so special about Toy Story is that it is the first movie ever to be made entirely of CGI. It worked wonders with toys... not so much with human beings. Buzz and Woody's friendship is touching and their subplots through out the movie to return to Andy are inspiring. Good work Pixar, original - no. Worth the watch - definitely!Toy Story 2 changes things up the second time out. The characters are all memorable - Jessie in particular has that tear - inspiring moment - and it's all good and entertaining like before. Continuing with Buzz and Woody's friendship is Buzz 'to the rescue' of his friend when he becomes disllusioned with himself and his true toy heritage (a lovely 50's homage with Sputnik thrown in for good measure; though done quite a bit better in The Iron Giant which was also released that year; 1999) and it all still carries the Pixar CGI to new levels.Toy Story 3. It's been not ten years but eleven years. Andy's a bore, his dog's a snore and the toys have a reason to deplore. It's exactly like Spiderman 3. Good ideas but just no proper pacing. Woody and Buzz - who saw each other for short intervals in TS2 - have maybe two moments together and their unlikely teamwork was the birth of beauty that gave lift to TS1 and helped elevate TS2 up enough so that it didn't plummet. What could have been an emotional turn for one of the best scenes in animation was abruptly cut short... because the kiss up aliens had to 'save the day' and what was a sweet gesture at the end where Andy gives his toys away turns into an awkward play session.No more, Pixar. No more.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Remake of Toy Story 2 That is Revered for No Discernible Reason,"I don't really care but I was appalled by how phoned in this was upon rewatching it for the first time since the theatrical release.The movie is such an egregious rehash of the second one that I had to list he similarities for my own sanity in case I was missing something, as this is so highly rated.The Lotso character is a composite of Stinky Pete and Jessie. He's literally the same exact character as Pete with the backstory of Jessie, sappy flashback and all.The same thing happens with Buzz. In 2 there's an imposter and here he is not himself, practically the same thing.In 2, the gang comes to Woody's rescue to find out he wants to stay, only for him to find out the fat country bumpkin leader is a psycho. Here, the gang wants to stay only to find out the fat country bumpkin leader is a tyrant, so Woody tries to rescue them.It starts like 2 with a fantasy intro that takes up too much time, and then you see a rehash of the original's intro in the form of home videos, I guess you didn't get by now that Andy used to play with his toys.The characters barely have anything to say and feel like caricatures. Jessie has abandonment issues and we hear her reference that almost like she's describing the screenwriter's bullet points of her character.I guess the idea is that we already know these characters well, but then why is time wasted on showing the audience all the good times Andy had with them? Isn't that implied and understood? I guess it's just nostalgic saccharine but it doesn't make me feel anything.The movie is joyless and almost nihilistic. The only reason the characters wind up in the daycare is because they refuse to believe there was a mix-up. They're just able to accept their fate like it's nothing.Seriously, Pixar wanted to do this over the Buzz Lightyear recall idea? I understand if that's not the direction they wanted, but I would've rather seen that if these were my only options.Who thought this world was worth revisiting just to be inside a crummy daycare the entire time? In the first one you see several locations and the second even more so.In hindsight, this was just foreshadowing the abominable travesty that is the fourth one. That was so bad I felt sickened and turned it off -- this is better than that -- but when I think about it, the fourth is an extension of what was started here, even recycling the same plot points such as Lotso being stranded on a vacation.This plays like a remix of every idea that was already used in the previous two. Why does this movie exist and why do so many seem to love it?",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Another Pixar masterpiece,"By now, it's become a cliché to say ""Pixar has done it again."" But that doesn't make it any less true.Year after year, Pixar releases movies that leave audience's jaws on the floor. Toy Story 3 is no exception. With 15 years' worth of personal investment in the series, Pixar has crafted their most emotional outing yet. We've grown up with these characters (I was 5 when the first one came out, and as Andy heads off to college, I'm just home from my first year), so there's already a built-in connection. We care what happens to these toys. It's a world we're all familiar with: not just because the films have been around for a decade and a half, but because everyone has had toys and (probably) grown out of them. It's an interesting reflection of our reality, because as we flinch when Andy calls his toys ""junk,"" we know that we've done the same.I cried. A lot. On the way home, I cried some more. Pixar has done a simply beautiful job of finishing this series. It's always been fun to see the way the toys handle different aspects of life that are stressful for them: birthday parties, Christmas, yard sales. But having their owner grow up and leave them is something totally different. While many of the toys resign to their fate or even embrace the possibility of going to daycare, Woody's unflinching loyalty reminds us of why we love these characters so much in the first place. And these reasons are reiterated to great effect in the final, amazingly written and executed scene.Perhaps the most impressive aspect of Toy Story 3 is the way all the different elements are blended so seamlessly. There's heart to spare, hilarious comedy, clever writing, and intense action sequences. In fact, I can't remember the last time I was so stressed out watching a movie. These toys have to run the gauntlet on their adventure, and it makes the ""no toy left behind"" policy even more affecting.Genre lines are blurred, as well. The opening is an appropriate western/sci-fi mix that hearkens back to the first film. A large portion of the film takes on the characteristics of a prison break film to thrilling effect. Each generic evolution feels natural, making the movie increasingly complex and thus, the perfection with which it's pulled off that much more impressive.As with all of Pixar's films, the technical aspects are dazzling. The animation is simply beautiful, especially the texturing that's achieved on some of the softer characters, like Lotso. The 3-D is well-implemented and utterly unintrusive. There are no gimmicks here; Pixar doesn't make things pop out of the screen to justify the heightened ticket prices. The film itself is worth the money, and the 3-D just makes everything look that much crisper and more gorgeous.The voice cast is phenomenal as always. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are still the perfect leading pair, and all their support is hilarious. The new additions to the cast are fantastic, as well. Michael Keaton as Ken gets a lot of the films biggest laughs. He captures just the right blend of sinister and clueless, with a healthy dollop of vanity to coat it all. Other new highlights include the wonderful Kristen Schaal and Timothy Dalton in small supporting parts.The series also continues its tradition of great villains in the vein of Sid (who makes a subtle cameo as a garbage man) and the Prospector. This time, we get a terrifying pair in the form of the cute and cuddly Lotso and the horrific, droopy-eyed Big Baby, who recalls the claw- bodied doll head from the first film. The pair make an interesting team and are given a backstory that makes them more sympathetic than most film villains. Their flashback is reminiscent of Jessie's in the second film (although there's no heart-breaking song accompanying it).Randy Newman is back in the music department and delivers an appropriately flexible and exciting score. He also provides a great new song to the Toy Story canon: ""We Belong Together"" (can you think of a better title?), which plays over the credits as fun extra scenes help relieve the emotional load.Simply put, Toy Story goes above and infinitely beyond my highest hopes and expectations. It tugs at the heartstrings in a genuine way. In typical Pixar fashion, there's no emotional trickery being pulled here. Pixar's focus has always been on story, and with their latest masterpiece, they've brought their first story to a beautiful, fitting close. I couldn't be happier.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Another Deserving Hit,"I just attended a free screening and, without having seen the ending (it was a ""cliffhanger"" screening), I believe this is the best Toy Story yet. I didn't know if they'd be able to keep the magic going but this story is extremely clever and, as per usual, beautifully animated. From the beginning I found myself happily smiling in my seat. The new characters are funny and support the old cast, some of whom are reinvented in their own ways, wonderfully. This movie had a college crowd laughing hysterically, showing that Disney Pixar movies can truly be for all ages. Although I was afraid the plot would become too stretched by having Andy head off to college it still manages to be very heartfelt. I'll be excitedly going to see the rest of it in June.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Magnificent,"I'm not as eloquent as all the other people who have been writing reviews on here. But I'm absolutely a huge Toy Story fan, especially since I was 7 years old when the first one came out in 1995, and I've watched it so many times I can basically quote the whole movie.Needless to say I've been excited about Toy Story 3 for months, ever since I found out it was coming out. And for some reason I wasn't even worried that it wouldn't be good. Somehow I just knew it would be. And wow was I right. I dragged my friend to the movie with me, and even though she's not a huge Toy Story fan, she loved the movie too.I laughed out loud during almost the entire movie, and could not believe that parts of it actually made me cry. Toy Story 3 was magical, wonderful, amazing, brilliant, and so fabulously done. And my words aren't even doing justice to it! Really! So if you haven't seen it, just go see it!! Pixar isn't just for kids. But we're all kids at heart anyway.If you're like me, and you grew up with Toy Story, it being that one movie that you watched over and over and over again, driving your parents crazy, then you absolutely MUST go see this movie, and you'll love it.

"We Waited 11 years, and here it is!","I just got back from a midnight showing and knew I must write my review, so here it is ladies, gentlemen and children of all ages...Toy Story 3 has brought together all of our favorite characters once again in the last installment of the childhood film most of us have grown up on. While the 3-D effects are better than what I have seen in previous 3D movies this year, there was something a lot different about this film than the other.It was dark, and lacked its 'gift' that Pixar always used to bring to us, which is the feeling of being a child again and smiling as we remember those days then when sometimes we wondered if our toys really did come alive. There are a few scenes (actually half the movie) is dark and definitely scary for a 4 year old. The humor is dry and I only laughed outloud 3 times, though everyone else was cracking up because of some drunk in the front row who constantly screamed.I felt something was missing a well. Buzz Lightyear. No, he was in the movie. But he really did not make a ""Last""ing impression on me and wished there was more to see. Also, same with the alien guys, ""The claaaaaaaw!"" The ending was good though, aside from some scary bits and highly disturbing images for small children, it rounded off nicely and finally lightened up much like a depressed person taking a prozac. I also kept wondering whatever happened to Sid, the demonic kid down the street...In all honestly, I don't think this film deserves the super high rating it has gotten because it lacks the spark its previous two films had. I give it a 7/10. It was decent, but not the best out of the 3. That would have to go to the original Toy Story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Makes Toy Story 1 and 2 look like shrek the third,"without a doubt the best movie of year and decade, this movie made toy story 1 and 2 look like shrek the third, yea its that good! me and my girlfriend went to go see this at the premiere and we both cried like babies. I grew up to toy story, i grew up with andy, and its really unbelievable how pixar can flow the emotions from sad to funny without ruining any beautiful moments 10/10. I predict a Multi- Oscar Winner here! If you want to cry go see toy story 3 and skip jonah hex and karate kid and A team! P: i hope this is not the end of toy story if it is i will DIE, btw, barbie and ken made me burst out laugh the whole entire time!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Just Cutting Onions,"When this movie came out, I was 18 years old and had just finished high school days before its release. My young adult peers and I were clearly the target audience. We filled the audience at the midnight opening. They had us hooked since we saw the original at 4-5 years old. The plot of Andy going off to college pulled so hard at our heartstrings as we were all about to go off and do the same.The level of emotion expressed in this movie is unlike anything you normally find in an animated feature. Just thinking of that breathtaking farewell scene at the end makes my tears well up to this day. Someone must've been cutting onions, because I've never seen so many grown men tearing up as I exited a movie theater that night.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

The best one out of the franchise,This is the best one! #1 coming in a close second and #2 a close third. Fourth one didn't seem to have the same magic. Absolutely a great franchise though. I have to watch it once a year.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
It's INSANE how good this is. Top 3 Pixar.,"Jeez. This movie is so amazing. In fact I believe it's one of the best animated movies ever made. If you had told me before I started rewatching all these that this would be top 3, I would've laughed. I have now come to the realization that I was wrong, this is one of the best. I still think I like the first one better by just a small margin, but that does not mean this one is anything short of incredible. I don't cry during movies, but the ending of this movie is one of the closest I've ever come to crying. This and The Green Mile. Definitely the second best Toy Story movie. I believe I saw this in theaters on opening night when I was almost 6, so this was really nostalgic. A movie for all-time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
OK stop making Shrek movies and spend more time on Toy Story!!!,"I have yet to see a Toy Story flick i hate. I mean they keep getting better and better and the ending had me teary eyed if you can believe that??? It's toys for god's sake!!! There are several items that make this franchise work...#1 Great writers over at Pixar loved all their stories aside from Ratatouillie #2 smart casting on the voice talent...were all time consumingly carefully selected. #3 Toy Story can never get boring due to the fact that they can always find different and older toys we haven't seen or used in centuries to add to the mix. All these make for the perfect family adventure. This story unfolds with the toys recollecting a moment in time during one of Andy's play time scenarios, Actually the opening scene in Toy Story 1 you remember.. Black Bart..little BO peep's sheep strapped to the railroad tracks??? And then our story turns to present time and we see the toys struggling with the fact that Andy who is now 18 is leaving for college. In a huge mistake a garbage bag of toys that were supposed to be headed for the attic get sent to the local daycare to unfold a whole new heap of adventures as once again Woody,Buzz and the rest of the gang try their best to get back to Andy before its too late. A good story with a touching ending that the whole family will love as the Kyle family did. To sum things up i say once again Bravo!!!Pixar!!!!",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Great Movie - But a Little Dark,"If there are parent reading this that want to take their very young ones to see Toy Story 3 , then I feel obliged to warn you that this movie may not be suitable for children four years of age and younger. Why? Because there are a couple of characters in this movie that are cutesy at times, but frighteningly creepy at other times. If you choose to take your small ones to see the film anyways, just be wary when Lotso and Big Baby are on the screen. Be especially wary of Big Baby. The way Disney uses that character can give nightmares for years.I saw the first Toy Story movie and enjoyed it. I have not yet seen the second one. I do remember the first one missing that Disney darkness that all Disney productions seem to have. In most Disney movies you are left emotionally drained from the very high ups you are exposed to that lead to the very low downs. Characters die, people cry and the movie can be quite depressing.But the first Toy Story movie lacked that darkness, and that may be why I was able to enjoy that movie. In Toy Story 3 the darkness is back, and this is one wild roller coaster ride of emotions. The overall theme of the movie is depressing, the action makes you feel helpless and the ending is less than satisfying. I will say that Tom Hanks is a great actor even when you cannot see him acting. The combination of Hanks and Tim Allen still has that magic and that helps bring the movie back around at the end. The problem is the two characters spend most of the movie apart, and the story misses out on that interaction.I wish I could tell you that Toy Story 3 is a fun movie to just let the kids watch, but that isn't even true. The bad guys are creepy evil, and the sad scenes are drawn out to the point of making anyone depressed. Lighting is used to perfection here, but all it really does is cause a chill to go up your spine.As an adult I enjoyed this movie. I can handle the emotional roller coaster it puts you on, and the nightmares went away for me within a day or two of seeing the movie. I worry about the kids that will flock to this movie and how long it will take them to recover. It is pretty obvious that Disney is using 3D to try and make the movie interesting rather that relying on the story itself. I don't see movies in 3D because I don't want to get sucked in by the novelty. In the case of this production, I am glad I missed out on the creepy 3D effects.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Not quite,"Toy Story one and two were very decent movies. The animation was excellent and the actual storyline was entertaining, even for the adult audience. Toy Story 3 maintains the excellent visual effects and Pixar's animation is excellent as always. But the story writers fell asleep at the pen and pad this time around. The battle of good and evil, the friends and foes was perhaps a little too intricate for the intended viewing audience. Children. Disturbingly enough for adults you were taken on this emotional roller coaster of loss, anxiety, fear, deceit, and just about everything else. How the writers bring this coaster to its finish was even more poor. This really wasn't the movie that I think many children would have learned anything from, let alone enjoyed. -Ravi Shanghavi, Ottawa",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Disappointing,"This film was overlong, and lagged in the middle. There was insufficient humour and character development. The rescue scenes towards the end seemed contrived towards.Worse of all, it was far too dark and frightening for young children. I could here some of the audience getting quite restless.The final scene and outro were excellent, but also reinforced how much the film itself had lost it's way.All in all, I was disappointed.Toy Story 1 and 2 were truly wonderful films and I have watched them several times since, but this one won't be joining my DVD collection.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Near perfect trilogy closer,Even if it's no longer the final chapter Toy Story 3 is still a beautiful end to the Toy's journey with Andy. It's a great escape that's moving from the start and an emotional journey about saying goodbye when it's necessary made all the more impactful because it's willing to let the moment really sink in. It couldn't be a better conclusion to this trilogy that offers a really fun adventure full of tear inducing emotional maturity.Tom Hanks gives another endlessly animated performance as Woody as he remains the epitome of perfect casting here. The same applies to Tim Allen who is equally committed and continues to balance the overly stern humour of Buzz with genuine affection for his friends as their connection only grows stronger. Every other returning actor is effortless in reprising their role and Ned Beatty as the new villain brings a believable villainy that comes from heartbreaking pain.Lee Unkrich's direction starts strong thanks to a fun action scene powered by Andy's imagination followed by a heartfelt montage and it never falters afterwards. It's always impressive how the animation can nail every movement of all the different kinds of toys present and it's only been pushed further here as it continues to advance. It allows the film to age more gracefully compared to other animated movies that have human protagonists and are more obsessed with realism.Randy Newman's score and songs remain vital for the emotional core to work as well as it does. It's a constant presence that's always matching the scene flawlessly but it is those big final moments where it really comes to life as the score and imagery say everything without saying anything. You've Got a Friend in Me will never get old or lose any of its lovely warmth and the new song played over the credits works well despite it obviously being nowhere near as memorable.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"What it lacks in originality, it makes it up entirely in its ending.","After 11 years later, we finally get to see another Toy Story movie! Even though it wouldn't be realistic to expect this sequel to be as good as Toy Story 2, you can always believe that Pixar will deliver another entertaining film.It was so refreshing to see all the Toy Story characters again. Surprisingly, the only speaking toy character that was in the first two films that was absent in Toy Story 3 was Bo Peep. Other than her, the rest of Andy's toys have returned and all of them get a good amount of screen time. As for the new toys, Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear (Ned Beatty) & Ken (Michael Keaton) have the largest roles.If there is something negative about this movie is that it lacks originality, but the ending is golden! As for the generic portion of the film; you will notice that the formula for this movie is very similar to Toy Story 2, such as the villain and the toys' rescue mission. As for the conclusion of this movie, it is so good that I hope they do NOT make a 4th film. It feels so fitting to have this movie end the trilogy, as the moral & theme of the story represents the entire Toy Story films.I was surprised at how emotional the final scene was; but then again, Pixar is great at adding the human elements into their stories & characters. As for the main theme song ""You got a Friend in Me"", it's a universal message throughout the entire Toy Story films, to the very last sequence of this movie. As for the moral of the story (including the whole trilogy), it is learning to let go when the time is right; whether you are a toy, a child or a parent. I loved how this film ends! What it lacks in originality, it makes it up entirely in its conclusion.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Third time's a Charm,"I think the harshest thing I could say about the latest Pixar adventure, or Toy Story movie, for that matter, is even attempting to determine with Toy Story film is the best.How Pixar does it blows my mind. Time and again. Sure, they start with what I consider the number one quality of any movie: story. Character depth and development ranks second for me. Despite all my male-counterparts that simply love action, things blowing up, beautiful women (or people,) etc., fall behind – far behind – the front two.Toy Story 3 has all qualities needed to make a fantastic, adventurous and successful movie for tons of people of all creeds. But it puts both of my favorite staples first: excellent story with (yes, even animated) deep characters. And it's a lot of fun to boot.Starting off with a literal bang, Toy Story 3 sets the scene early that these ""Toys of Owner Andy"" love to be played with. It's what they were made for, what they yearn for and it gives them hope and a soul. Unfortunately for them, like the expiration on food, (yes, even Twinkies, thanks Zombieland) kids grow up and out of toys.Will Andy be faithful, keeping his prized Buzz Lightyear (Allen,) Woody (Hanks) or (most of) the rest of his toys, ones adults like me grew up with in Toy Story and Toy Story 2? Kinda.As in usual Toy Story fashion, there are mishaps and the adventure begins! Follow the toy crusaders from this point on from Andy's house to the curb, from the day care of hell to new child's house and so on.I would hate to even divulge in more of the secrets, twists, turns, comedy (and I mean roll on floor laughing humor), suspense or ideas presented. I can't imagine even some movie-goers on the fence that actually ""have to decide"" to see it.As equally tough as it would be to rank all Pixar movies – though, I plan to – and rank these Toy Story movies in order, it would be equally hard to pinpoint the best parts of Toy Story 3, aside from to aforementioned great script and characters. But, I'll try.I loved the monkey! Though brief, I laughed so hard every second he was on screen. Furthermore, I loved the other new characters, especially Mr. Pricklepants (Dalton.) I loved the intro. I loved the plan of escape. I loved the Ken ""secret"" references. I loved the español. I loved the comity (as found in the other Toy Story movies, but I would say it's most evident in this feature) between the leads, as well as newcomers. I loved the extreme attention to detail, the crispness of the film and the cinematography while never forgetting this is a cartoon. (And to add to that, by far, the graphics and technology has tripled this time around, even though the previous groundbreaking entries were still way above par.) I loved the overall comedy, including the tongue-in-cheek jokes. (I actually found myself laughing hard and out loud at some of the under-the-radar jokes that apparently no one else either caught or cared for. It was a tough and somewhat quiet crowd around me – aside from the annoying and crying kids and their equally inattentive guardians who don't know how to muffle their kids.) I love that as well created and designed it is, this could very well be a stand-alone feature, though it helps to see the first two and it does play homage to fans of the other Toy Story movies. So much so, it's hard NOT to get choked up in the finale, if you can make it that far without getting somewhat emotional.That's just a short list. There's so much wonder and awe and it's jaw dropping that Pixar, or the returning voice talent/actors could pull this offagain. But they did. It's highly recommended, and I would say to see it on IMAX 3-D for the quality and grand scale – like I did, but Disney STILL has yet to shock me with their ""version"" of 3-D. I was blown away during the 3-D in Monsters Vs. Aliens, but here, like in Up, it was so-so. Thankfully, Pixar does know how NOT to rely on 3-D as a gimmick. They spend their money on the talent to create everlasting stories, fun and adventures.Side Note: The preceding animated short, one I always look forward to prior to any Pixar film, Day & Night, was pretty good, and inventive, but not great. At least it featured Vegas.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Movie For The Ages,"The one name in Hollywood today that can be truly, universally trusted every time is Pixar Animation Studios. Their two ""missteps"", ""Cars"" and ""A Bug's life"", are disappointments only in that they don't contend for best movie Pixar has made. They're A minuses instead of A's. ""Toy Story 3"" joins the pantheon of great Pixar films, and all-time great sequels. It stands out as the best film of 2010 at this point. While it may not be as brilliant from start to finish as the second ""Toy Story"" film (the animated equivalent of ""The Godfather Part II""), is so engaging, so witty and entertaining and exciting, that adults and children will be pulled in all the way. And the third act ramps up the emotion to a degree equal to the best of it's predecessors (my 5 year old nephew had to turn around and ask ""why are you cwying?"") The highly publicized plot line deals with the toys beloved owner Andy moving on to college, and choosing the fate of his beloved toys. Through one of those complex farcical events that seems so common in Andy's household, the attic bound toys (minus Woody, who is supposed to go to college with Andy) are accidentally donated to a daycare center. Woody, of course, has to rescue his friends, but there is some doubt as to whether they want to be rescued: Andy hasn't played with them for years, and the daycare, a toytopia presided over by lovable teddy bear named Lotso Hogs Bear (voiced by Ned Beatty, in a welcome return to the screen), promises the chance to be played with everyday. And when these kids get older, new kids replace them. To the love starved toys (especially Jesse the yodeling cowgirl, who is terrorized of repeating the experience she had with her beloved Emily), this seems like the opportunity of a lifetime. It goes without saying that all is not as it seems.Part of the genius of Pixar is that, in what are ostensibly children's films, they deal with very sophisticated and adult themes. Here, the struggle to grow up while holding onto the joy of childhood is captured beautifully, as are the themes of moving on and dealing with the loss of loved ones (there is a a brief reference early in the film, just a few lines, where Woody's reaction, between the animation and the greatness of Tom Hanks voice acting, is an exquisitely subtle and poignant heartbreaker). And, of course, the comedy is hilarious. I wouldn't have thought there was still new material left to be milked from the Potato Head's detachable appendages, but the new twists are innovative and hysterical.If you have kids, take them to ""Toy Story 3"". If you don't, go anyway. Pixar has once again proved that they are the most reliable name in film today.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
not a masterpiece but still enjoyable,"The toys are back for another adventure, but the context this time is that Andy is about to go off to college and has to decide what to do with his playthings. When they accidentally get sent to a children's daycare, they find both a new obstacle and a dark story behind some of the toys.I wouldn't call ""Toy Story 3"" a masterpiece, but I enjoyed it nevertheless. I understand that there's a fourth movie planned. If so, then it will be missing two of the original cast members: Jim Varney died not long after ""Toy Story 2"" and his role got recast in this movie, while Don Rickles just died a few months ago.And as I always do when discussing one of these movies, I have to discuss the cast. We all know who Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack, Ned Beatty, Estelle Harris, Michael Keaton, Bonnie Hunt and Whoopi Goldberg are. Wallace Shawn is best known for ""My Dinner with Andre""* but also played Vizzini in ""The Princess Bride"". John Ratzenberger is apparently best known for a role on ""Cheers"" but I only know him from this franchise. Jodi Benson voiced Ariel in ""The Little Mermaid"". Timothy Dalton played James Bond in the late '80s, and his Bond is known as the worst (although personally I think that Sean Connery was the ONLY good one). Kristen Schaal and Jeff Garlin are standup comics. Laurie Metcalf plays Sheldon's mom on ""The Big Bang Theory"" and recently won a Tony for a Broadway performance. R. Lee Ermey is best known as the brutal drill sergeant in ""Full Metal Jacket"".Anyway, you'll probably like the movie.*My parents met him and Andre Gregory around the time that it got released.

"To me, this is by far and large the best Pixar film to date!","To me, Pixar have never yet made a bad film, even their weakest Cars is actually very good. Like a lot of people here, I grew up with and loved the first two Toy Story films and still love them. As is consistently the case with Pixar they are superbly animated, sophisticated and had great characters. Toy Story 3 somehow managed to do the seemingly impossible, while its Toy Storys 1 and 2 have a special place in my heart, this film was even better.Perhaps Toy Story 3 isn't the most original of the trilogy or of the Pixar films, but that made little difference to me. While the darkest of the three, it still maintained the predecessors' heart and charm, and overall it was just an amazing film full-stop from start to finish, and easily one of the best of the year.The animation is just superb here. Hardly a surprise though, as the animation was phenomenal also in Toy Storys 1 and 2, but to me it was just as sophisticated and as colourful here if not more so. I also loved the music, that said I don't think it is the best Pixar score(Up) or best score of the year, but it is almost certainly one of Randy Newman's better efforts and I liked the You've Got a Friend in Me repeat.The pacing is just fine as well, and the story is tremendously engaging with plenty of humorous, tense, exciting and genuinely affecting scenes. The ending especially resonated with my entire family, especially my brother, while the scene in the dump is for me Pixar's most intense scene.I was also delighted with the film's script. The dialogue was always witty and sharp, none of it felt forced in any way. There was the brilliantly judged humour- Buzz speaking Spanish was just one of the highlights and the beginning alone had about 5 or 6 laughs- and also the poignant parts that avoided being overly-sentimental and mawkish.Another strength is in the characters. All the main characters are as likable as ever, Woody is still determined, Buzz is a sheer delight, Jessie(though I actually like her) is more tolerable here and Mr Potato Head is hilarious. But the new characters are just as wonderful, the baby is both creepy and cute and I felt for him at the end, the cymbal monkey especially for that shriek is one of Pixar's scariest characters, Lotso looks cuddly but is actually shady and bitter with an unrelenting past and Ken is cool without being bland or annoying.As ever, the voice work is brilliant from all involved, not just from Tom Hanks and Tim Allen but also from Ned Beatty whose crusty demeanour fitted Lotso like a glove.In conclusion, a truly brilliant film and a fitting conclusion to an amazing trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Welcome return to the Toy Story world,"The open scene great is brilliant at reintroducing the characters and Toy Story world and the film doesn't disappoint and feels like a welcome return for the Toy Story franchise.As always the animation is fantastic, and Lotso is a superbly layered villain.

All's well that ends SWELL!,"I waited a few days to review TOY STORY 3 as I was profoundly moved and wanted my feelings to subside a bit. I was puzzled as to why a 50 year old man would feel emotional about a kids movie (and a third installment to boot). I have a 11 year old son who LOVED the Toy Story characters, yet during the movie; even at the end he was far more composed then his old man. TOY STORY 3 is a wonderful film. Read the other reviews for plot descriptions and more superlatives as I agree with them all. For us folks with kids I can tell you I believe the root cause why you maybe so moved to tears as I was. Through our children we learned about and grew to care about these characters. They represent our children's early childhood; a time for joy and wonders. Now our children are growing into teenagers and we collectively weep for those days not long ago we could marvel at how our children would drag around a Tattered Woody or hold up a Buzz Lightyear and exclaim ""To infinity and beyond!"". If your children ever pulled you through Disneyland and waited in line to stand with Woody and Jesse, get a photo and maybe even an autograph, this film will so remind of those lost days that well....lets just say bring tissue and thank god for the 3 D glasses as you don't want anyone to see you crying over what my son says ""Is a cool movie...for little kids"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Enchanting, loving, and emotional. Toy Story 3 lives up to high expectations and more.","I've been watching Toy Story as long as I can remember and now its hard to imagine this great trilogy come to an end. Toy Story 3 delivers beyond what we were expecting. It has great comedy, wonderful performances by its all-star cast, probably one of the most emotional stories made by Pixar, and a climax so suspenseful it makes the ending all the more emotional.Toy Story comes from an older generation of films. By now everyone who saw the films when they were younger is grown or just about grown. But it doesn't stop Pixar. Toy Story was one of the first animated films I had ever seen. Then Toy Story 2 came out and that film helped keep me fixated on Toy Story for a long time. Now I'm older, but it doesn't stop me from loving Toy Story and its great sequels. In a way I think its the filmmakers saying goodbye to the older generation of kids who first saw Toy Story and the other great Pixar films and welcoming a new generation. However you look at it there is still an obvious message in the film. And the message is simple but like all Pixar movie messages are they are also smart (especially the way its executed), but I think I'll let you find out what it is on your own.The film is about Andy leaving for college and now the toys are worried about their future. Then one thing leads to another and they end up at Sunnyside (a daycare) where they meet some new toys like the leader Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear and at first they think its great until they learn that they were put in the toddlers playroom. After being tortured by the kids they learn Andy is looking for them so they decide to break out of there. However they learn that Lotso isn't as nice as he seems. So now with time running short before Andy leaves they have to break out and learn what it truly means to be a toy.I found this film to being darker than the previous Toy Story films. In the first film Woody and Buzz are afraid of being alone on the side of the road or being trapped in an evil kids house. In the second one Woody's afraid of being sent to Japan. But in this film the toys are afraid that they're going to die. And the darker element I have to say is great. It helps build for a more suspenseful climax and shows that Lotso is probably one of the most evil and insane villains created by Pixar. Especially since at first he seems nice and lovable but when he shows how cruel he is you know the toys are in trouble. And the darker element got me thinking about Up and Wall-e. Both of those movies were Pixar's move out of their comfort zone. Wall-e being a post-apocalyptic film with a message about the future of the world if people don't change and Up taking on serious elements like marriage, life, death, and learning to let go. And now Toy Story 3 does something different as well, it has a much darker tone for a Pixar film which really works. There might be a couple scenes where younger kids might be scared but nothing that should terrify them beyond the point of seeing this film.And a little warning, this film is a tearjerker. The end practically had me tearing up and a couple times I felt a tear run down my cheek and I could see it in the faces of the rest of the audience as well. The film is meant to be bitter sweet. Because of that tears are pretty much guaranteed.This film brings back some of the most beloved characters in film-making history and even brings back its audience from more than a decade ago. There are so many memories in the Toy Story films anyone who loved them when they were a kid can't help but see this film and shed a few tears for their old childhood friends. And who can blame them (including me) for doing so, Pixar has proved time and time again that animated films are for more than just children and that the emotional aspects of the films can even be better than some of the best live action dramas that have ensured tears from their audience.My love for animation has proved to live on again in the new Toy Story film. Ladies and gentlemen what we have here is sure to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Film this year. I thought it wasn't possible but my high expectations were met when I saw Toy Story 3. It has beautiful animation, loving characters, a great and emotional story, and a finale fit for the toys who have enchanted our lives for more than a decade. Toy Story 3 is the best Toy Story from the trilogy and is yet another Pixar masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
It's all about the story!,"The third part of every trilogy usually ruins the series. ""Toy Story 3"" was almost a victim because the plot was suppose to be about ""Buzz having a defect and he was shipped to Taiwan to be fixed but instead he's going to be replace by another Buzz Lightyear, and the other toys will rescue him."" if that's the plot of ""Toy Story 3"" then it will be an unnecessary sequel. But good thing Pixar changed it in to a better plot. Everyone's favorite childhood movie is back to the big screen and it is still the same old Toy Story movie that we always love! Toy Story 3 is one of the best sequels of all time.The reason why other third parts of the trilogy fails because they didn't have a great story. Pixar never made a bad movie yet because they care about the story of their movies. The movie is non-stop entertainment. There are no boring parts. Even the parts with no dialog are so entertaining. The old characters still have their same old personality. The new characters are fun to watch, but too bad Mr. Pricklepants didn't have enough screen time. I liked that character even though he didn't have enough scenes. Randy Newman's music score is a little nostalgic to the first two Toy Story movies.""Toy Story 3"" is darker, suspenseful, exciting, and has more drama than the first two movies.

Toy Story 3. Let's be kids again...,"I am a 21 year old male. I watched the first Toy Story in theaters when I was 7 years old and the second Toy Story when I was 11. These films are a part of my childhood and I can assure you anyone between the ages of 18-30 have a special connection like I do for them. I personally have been waiting for this movie for 10 years now, since the ending sequences in Toy Story 2. Ten long years later, I finally received my wish.Toy Story 3 is the story of our classic and new favorite characters Woody, Buzz, Slinky, Ham, Rex and friends as they try to cope with the fact that Andy is going off to college. They haven't been played with in years and they're becoming restless. As much as they want to believe Andy will save them and keep them in the attic as Woody predicts, our beloved toys start to question his motives as college day is coming and Andy's old room is starting to deteriorate into a trash hold. Which will Andy decide upon? The plot for this movie at first glance made me very satisfied, seeing as Pixar and the writers are trying to follow the time frame we are accustomed to. Back in 1999 when Andy found his new toys Jesse and Bullseye, he was still a child with imagination and joy to play with these toys. Ten years later, he is no longer a child but grown into a graduating senior who is ready to venture off the college for the first time. This plot is a classic scenario that new-bound college teens deal with on their moving date: whether or not to give up hold on our childish bonds. It's time to grow up sometime. This plot grabbed me in easily.As the rest of the movie continued, Pixar led us on a classic Toy Story adventure, much like the opening scene in Toy Story where the Army men move downstairs to find what Andy receives in his birthday presents, or the scene in Toy Story 2 where the gang try to manage their way to the toy store across the highway. These very simple and drawn out scenes are what grab our attention because of the detail with every move, every instant that our friends are in peril. They also help a child who is watching to use their mind to follow along, from one frame to another, as Woody jumps from floor to toilet seat to toilet paper roll and nearly falls creating applause, up to the stall to the ledge and out the window for freedom. These actions take a lot from a child to stay along, which helps develop brain activity in problem solving. Step 1 to Step 6 leads to success, and this is a positive attribute to teach to our children.This movie is a little longer than most child films, close to 2 hours, which is a perfectly acceptable time frame for a movie so anticipated. Having it be under 90 minutes would have been a little selfish for the animators seeing as they knew how long we waited for this. If you are seeing this in 3D (which I believe is a must) you will be drawn in very easily and your attention will be kept throughout. With introductions of new characters and vigorous imagery, it is hard to lose track of what's going on. The animation was flawless as usual, storyline close to perfection, characters are lovable... I truly see no reason to dislike this film.Overall I gave it an 8 out of 10. This movie lives up to the first 2 in the series, not so sure about being better than the original. Close but undecided. You can make your own judgment call. If you are between the ages of 18-30 or you have children of your own, this film is one of the better ones you will see all year. Be a kid again, it won't hurt for 2 hours.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The Box Office is Dominated by Toys,"Let me first start off by saying that this was my most anticipated movie of the summer. Not Ironman 2, not A-Team or Karate Kid, no it was Toy Story 3. Many of my friends laughed at me because I was going to see this movie with anticipation. I still maintained my dignity because, well, Toy Story was my favorite Pixar film and it was a good part of my childhood.So, in honor of that, I went to go see Toy Story 3. First there's this short, called DAY AND NIGHT, which actually fascinated me. It was a mixture of hand-drawn animation and the 3D we are accustomed to today. I don't want to say too much about it, but if you really put some thought into it, it's pretty deep.Then it was Toy Story 3 itself. I must admit, I wasn't sure if the film was showing promise in the beginning. I got what was going on but, well, there was a storm outside and my mind was lingering on that. I was thinking, ""Man, if this film isn't any good really soon, I'm going to go check out this storm!"" I love storms, as you can probably tell. And I was soon regretting paying for my ticket that night and waiting for the matinée the next day.Then something happened. I forgot about the storm. I was sucked into this film. I was engrossed into the characters once more, the story, the environments, and I soon came to realize that nothing was really lost between Toy Story 3 and Toy Story 2. Pixar, yet again, makes a satisfying film.After watching this film, I went home and I read a lot of other reviews, mainly those on IMDb.com. A lot of people talk about the climax of the film and how epic it is. It is. There's a lot going on and there's a lot of excitement in every turn. What makes this climax work, is something called EMOTION, which a lot of films seem to lack. You see, when you care about the characters that are put on screen, it generates reaction from the audience. It's an art form that is not easily mastered but somehow Pixar is able to wave that magic wand.However, the ending does lead to a flaw for me. It's how they written in how the bad guy of the movie gets what's coming to him. To me, it felt shoehorned into the script. It's like saying, ""Hey, how are we going to get rid of this guy now?"" And then someone is like, ""Well, let's just throw this scene here and DONE!"" Really, it was a little unsatisfying for me but that's about the only flaw I could really think of in the whole film.And last but not least, I cannot forget to mention Ken, voiced by Michael Keaton. Let's just say he made the movie. It was like that extra ingredient to make an already great film even better. In fact, I could hardly tell it was Michael Keaton. I had to really hone in on certain mannerisms of his voice to catch that it's him. Seriously, he was a riot and it almost seemed like he was having a lot of fun in that sound booth.All and all, check out Toy Story 3. Hopefully your friends won't laugh at you like they did to me!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Graduation,"You go to hear Steve Jobs at one of his Keynote addresses not because you worship the man. It is because you want to be a part of history. You want to be present at the moment that in the future people will say that the world changed. Jobs is a revolutionary; always was. Always will be.His whole approach is based on advancing, advancing, even if he ends up cannibalizing his own market. This is why no one can really compete, because there has to be a fearlessness to do the new. Pixar was like that, and it is why I cherished their projects. Oh, they used good old story engineering. And they were quite happy to pander to simple established emotional responses. But in every film they did two things which kept me coming back. You might call it the Orson Welles model:— advance the cinematic vocabulary so that the narrative has fresh power.— support a narrative that itself is new, that does not rely on genre conventions, so that it can hook to the cinema rather than the memory.Well, folks, Pixar might be dead as a force in film. This movie is a disaster. Oh, it is polished enough. It has that Pixar sheen. It is profoundly effective in making you cry at the endearing new character, Daisy. But it has no new visual ideas in it. None. None at all, the first Pixar project of which this can be said. I will point you to the texture of the shredded garbage toward the end and its luminescence which is novel. But this is merely a software advance that isn't leveraged. No. After giving us a new set of camera conventions every bit as influential as Hitchcock's, they have stopped.Disney? The ""just a manufactured product"" mentality? I guess.Oh, and the story. I will grant you that this story is superficially like the others. But look more closely. In the past, they have been scrupulously original. They would never, never have sullied a story by asking you to refer to another movie — excepting other Pixar movies of course. Let other, lessor studios do that, seemed to be their stance. So while it is okay for ""Madagascar: Escape 2 Afric"" to be made entirely of references to other films, Pixar stories connected because they connected with your emotions without a film memory as intermediary.But what do we have here? The central element is the big escape, and a half dozen movies are trotted out. Sure, we get it and it is even a fun thing. But it is not pure storytelling, not of the kind we expected.Don't go to this if you do not want your heart broken.

Good Movie,"To me, Pixar have never yet made a bad film, even their weakest Cars is actually very good. Like a lot of people here, I grew up with and loved the first two Toy Story films and still love them. As is consistently the case with Pixar they are superbly animated, sophisticated and had great characters. Toy Story 3 somehow managed to do the seemingly impossible, while its Toy Storys 1 and 2 have a special place in my heart, this film was even better.Perhaps Toy Story 3 isn't the most original of the trilogy or of the Pixar films, but that made little difference to me. While the darkest of the three, it still maintained the predecessors' heart and charm, and overall it was just an amazing film full-stop from start to finish, and easily one of the best of the year.The animation is just superb here. Hardly a surprise though, as the animation was phenomenal also in Toy Storys 1 and 2, but to me it was just as sophisticated and as colourful here if not more so. I also loved the music, that said I don't think it is the best Pixar score(Up) or best score of the year, but it is almost certainly one of Randy Newman's better efforts and I liked the You've Got a Friend in Me repeat.The pacing is just fine as well, and the story is tremendously engaging with plenty of humorous, tense, exciting and genuinely affecting scenes. The ending especially resonated with my entire family, especially my brother, while the scene in the dump is for me Pixar's most intense scene.I was also delighted with the film's script. The dialogue was always witty and sharp, none of it felt forced in any way. There was the brilliantly judged humour- Buzz speaking Spanish was just one of the highlights and the beginning alone had about 5 or 6 laughs- and also the poignant parts that avoided being overly-sentimental and mawkish.Another strength is in the characters. All the main characters are as likable as ever, Woody is still determined, Buzz is a sheer delight, Jessie(though I actually like her) is more tolerable here and Mr Potato Head is hilarious. But the new characters are just as wonderful, the baby is both creepy and cute and I felt for him at the end, the cymbal monkey especially for that shriek is one of Pixar's scariest characters, Lotso looks cuddly but is actually shady and bitter with an unrelenting past and Ken is cool without being bland or annoying.As ever, the voice work is brilliant from all involved, not just from Tom Hanks and Tim Allen but also from Ned Beatty whose crusty demeanour fitted Lotso like a glove.In conclusion, a truly brilliant film and a fitting conclusion to an amazing trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Cox.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Easily, this is animation movie making at its finest, by a wide margin.","I walked into this movie with high expectations, and this is usually a mistake. Not with TS3 it wasn't. Toy Story 3 was incredible, to put it in one word. Who would have known I would cry the most in Toy Story 3, more than I did in Any.Other.Movie -animation or not. It was just THAT engaging. It took me back to my childhood, and made me yearn for my Supermen models. It was very ""realistic"", which I know is an unusual way of describing an animation movie about living toys, but that's what it was. Incredible story, music, moments... everything.

Not for sensitive children or very young ones,"Although there were some funny parts in this film, I was terribly disappointed. This movie was very scary for young children - and it was excessive. I can handle a scary scene here and there, but for young children to endure half an hour of perilous scenes where the toys are almost crushed, incinerated and the like is just too much. Probably the most disappointing part in the film, was the fact that Pixar has now placed the idea into the heads of millions of children, that one day a mother might choose to not love their child anymore, and perhaps never did. Thanks for that one Pixar - brilliant move.It is very obvious that whoever developed the concept for this film and carried out the writing of it was not interested in how it might affect young children - their target audience. I have been quite the fan of Pixar, but have lost trust in their film-making. I am sure my son will be having nightmares. I wish we had never gone to see it, and if I had known it would be so far from the brilliant mark of the first two, I would not have.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Brilliant trilogy that stretches the imagination of a generation,"How long has it been, more than a decade? Woody and Buzz are among the founding members of my world of imagination. I looked at them as pioneers in my belief of boundaryless possibilities and optimism. Now the childhood heroes are finally back, a decade later, and it's absolutely worth the wait.Toy Story 3 is just brilliant in every way. True to Pixar's glorious traditions- top-notch art design, animation, voice performance and score. But most of all, kudos to the writers (cheif writer Michael Arndt, Oscar winner for writing Little Miss Sunshine). What an intriguing, beautiful and uplifting story filled with loads of cracking ideas that simply wowed you from time to time with their ingenuity and originality!Progressively strangled in the numbing professional life, a decade later, I am equally delighted and thankful to find a film that can help me pick up my fading passion for imagination, with laughs and with tears.I can go on and on but I sense words just wouldn't do justice to such sheer brilliance. The toy stories are truly a trilogy that greatly stretches the imagination of a generation. I have to admit, the primary reason that I'm adding yet another ode on IMDb is I want to associate myself with simply the best animation film of our time.I can't wait to have the entire trilogy on DVD and watch them all together again and show them to my future generations!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Simply Amazing,"I watched Toy Story 3 on its midnight premiere. It was great to have the crowd behind the characters, but also the story was really fun and emotional. It also helped that I have grown up with these characters (literally) the first one came out around the same time I was Andy's age and 1999- toy story 2 was 8. Now 10 years later the character Andy and I are both graduating, I always thought that was cool that pixar progressed his age, sorry for digressing. But anyways this movie is amazing, it breaks all the flaws of a second sequel a complete rarity. First most all the characters and voice overs come back except for slinky who sadly passed away but his friend voiced this one but its spot on, also there is explanation as to the whereabouts of the other toys that we do not see, bo beep, etch a sketch, and squeak. Leaving no apparent plot wholes. The story also progresses at a good pace, and makes you feel like a kid again, rooting for the characters every step of the way, it makes you hope that at the time of the movie your old toys are conversing waiting for you to play with them. Very nostalgic in that sense, I don't think at all that this was just a venture for Pixar to make more money, because the movie it so great! oh and all you Miyazaki fans, TOTORO has a cameo*!!!!

Simply Magnificent,"Pixar never ceases to amaze me. The Toy story franchise was destined for greatness from the beginning, and this third installment in the series lives up to its predecessors.I went into the theater with high expectations and hopes that it would be what I believed. My hopes were exceeded in the first few minutes of the film as my emotions were taken on a ride of crests and troughs throughout the entire experience.Not only that, but Pixar somehow managed to slip brand new characters into the plot so seamlessly that if you had never seen the two previous movies, you would have guessed that they had been around for the whole trilogy. I was in shock to see the third movie in a series perform better than any threequel I've ever seen. It even rivals the first two.If you haven't seen this movie, I recommend that you do.

best trilogy EVER!,"i watched toy story 1 when i'm about 5- back then, i didn't care much about the plot and of course, i didn't really look into the movie that well.. when i heard toy story 3 was coming out- i downloaded toy story 1 and 2 so i could watch it again and refresh my mind about the plot. from a VHS (if you still recall) to a hd rip file downloaded from the internet.. then i watched toy story 1 and 2, and it blew me away. it was even better than the movies today.. i couldn't get rid of the feeling of excitement for the trilogy. my mind was like - ""can pixar pull it off?; will it be better than 1 and 2?; andy is going to college, how can they end the story well?"" then it came, i watched 3 and after that... speechless, totally speechless. it was like after riding a extreme roller coaster, with your senses still tingling, your mind and soul couldn't get rid of the excitement.. the feeling just took over me and the only thing i really could think of doing is just to look at my ""roller coaster mates"" and say.. ""let's go again!"" p.s - there's only one thing missing though, woodie's lover. the girl sheperd. i wish they have included her in 3... oh well..",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
I am in the minority,"I've never been a humongous fan of the Toy Story franchise, but I went into this one with high expectations based on what my children had told me. Certainly, the animation is terrific and very realistic. However, the first half of the movie felt slow and boring to be honest. I did not find the characters interesting, and I felt like the movie was made for the sake of money. The second half was certainly more interesting. The plot line was original and unique. I still wasn't blown away as there were way too many plot holes and inconsistencies with things that didn't make sense. I know it's a cartoon, but things still need to be logical and coherent.

"A lovely, lovely film","Toy Story 3 (1:42, G, Imax, 3-D) — Fantasy: Fairy Tales, biggie, sequel""When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things."" (1 Corinthians 13:11)But did the childish things want to be put away? That's the question at the heart of Toy Story 3, in which Sheriff Woody (Tom Hanks), space ranger Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), cowgirl Jessie (Joan Cusack), and the rest of the toy menagerie face an uncertain fate after years of being neglected while Andy (John Morris) went thru adolescence and graduated from high school. Now he's preparing to head off to college, and mom (Laurie Metcalf) has come up with her own form of triage: take the toys to college, store them in the attic, or dump 'em in a trash bag for disposal.There's been a change in the cast of characters since last time. Bo Peep is gone (and we guess from a fleeting expression on Woody's face that there's an untold story there), but Andy's little sister has contributed her Barbie (Jodi Benson, whom I sure hope you all remember as the voice of The Little Mermaid) to the collection that Andy has, reluctantly, decided to donate to the Sunnyside Day Care Center. (The only one he's keeping is his old pal Woody, and this causes some conflicting emotions among the toys.)There are already a lot of toys at Sunnyside, and they're all under the sway of Lotso (Ned Beatty), short for Lots o'Hugging Bear, a big, pink, furry, strawberry-scented mass of folksy joviality and (it turns out) cynicism. Lotso welcomes the newbies, but they soon discover that it's because he needs cannon fodder for the Caterpillar Room, where the manic toddlers abuse them horribly, so that he and his favored minions can remain safely in the Butterfly Room, where they're treated kindly by the slightly older kids. (The filmmakers at Pixar researched toy treatment at real day-care centers to provide verisimilitude to these scenes.) At night, when the humans are gone, Lotso and his enforcers — Big Baby, Ken, sparkly purple octopus, and the grinning monkey with the cymbals — turn the school into a literal prison, complete with guard towers, spotlights, and roving spotter vehicles.After a series of misunderstandings and mishaps, Woody has reconnected with his old pals, and they determine to re-enact The Great Escape before they're all ripped to shreds. As always, the main reason a movie goes into detail over a plan of any kind is so you can see where it went wrong when it inevitably does.I will say no more about the plot other than that there's lots of it, it's all consistent (given the initial premise), and it all works well. While there are some scary moments in the movie, and a few sad ones as well, it deserves its G rating as completely suitable for small children. The dominant feelings you're left with are positive. Loyalty is rewarded; friendship is celebrated; there are lots of laffs, chuckles, and grins; it has a splendid voice cast; the 25th most important character in the movie is as exquisitely rendered as the main ones; and it is a visually sumptuous delight from beginning to end. (I was particularly fond of the cameo appearance by a stuffed Totoro doll in a non-speaking role, a hat-tip to Hiyao Miyazaki from the creative team at Pixar, who are better qualified than anyone else on Earth to know animation genius when they see it.)I saw Toy Story 3 in Imax and 3-D, because as a movie junkie I crave the most immersive movie-going experience I can get. Both were effective, neither was essential.I gave Toy Story 2 a 9 (my highest rating), because it contained a couple of scenes that left me so choked up I literally couldn't speak, and that's the mark of a job done to near perfection. Toy Story 3 falls just a skosh short of that standard, but it left me both misty- eyed and smiling. A worthy conclusion to the trilogy. A dandy film. For my money, the best SF&F movie of 2010 so far.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
It's an emotional roller coaster ride.,"I wasn't really of a fan of Toy Story 1 and 2 though it became a part of my childhood. So after 11 years; and the hype that it gets from my friends, I decided to give this one a try. I came to see it with low expectations. It turned out to be a really, really good movie. Even the short film before it, Day and Night, complemented the movie very well. It was visually amazing. Also, it has a great story. The 'old'characters were still lovable as well as the new ones. Barbie and Ken were great addition to the series. Big Baby was a bit scary though. Many scenes made the crowd inside the cinema laugh real hard but there were also those scenes that silence covered the entire room and sobs were the only sound that can be heard. The ending is very sad. It's so sad that it really had me crying on my seat. Just imagine, I'm an 18 yr old college guy and it had me crying like a baby. Well, it didn't embarrass me at all because when I turned around, people were crying too. So it turned out that I'm not the only one. That scene was just so perfect, with the right timing of music and the proper execution of emotions on the characters' faces, it's just so right. So for the last installment of, I must say, the well loved series, it is indeed the best. With the right amount of laughter, thrill, and tears, it is totally an emotional roller coaster ride. :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
I love you Pixar,"Those guys at Pixar know how to tell a story! These characters will live in our hearts forever! They really know how to tug at our hearts.This is more ramblings about the movie then a review.There are so many movies that can't get me emotionally involved, movies in which I don't care at all about the people whom I'm supposed to be rooting for.But Pixar knows how to get me. And it's not just a rooting interest, it's a love for characters, a love that hurts. I know I'm not the only one who's fallen in love in Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo, Up and most of all in the Toy Story movies.It's been so long since the first one that the special effects don't distract me in awe of them. The first two movies were so good that the story kept you from being distracted, but I couldn't help but stop and look at how beautiful the animation was. But now that I'm used to it, I was able to just watch the movie.The first half of the movie wasn't that great. It seemed like rehashed themes from the first two, but the second half of that movie made up for it and much more.The key to the puzzle of this movie, for me, as a father, was that moment when the mother sees Andy's room empty and realizes that her baby has grown up and he's moving away. That moment captured that whole movie's spirit.It was time to let go and say goodbye.Thank you Pixar.

A worthy completion of a classic trilogy,"I went to the San Francisco Film Festival screening at Pixar Studios last night not really knowing what to expect. Toy Story has been with us for 15 years now (20, in terms of actual development) and I had a sinking feeling that maybe all the character potential had been used in the first two and this was some shameless plot by Disney to exploit the franchise (""Little Mermaid 2"", anyone?). Well, shame on me for underestimating the capabilities of Pixar, who once again have shown how a small studio in Emeryville is a storytelling powerhouse that leaves the rest of the industry in the dust.Toy Story 3 is the tale of Andy, the toys' owner, going to college and their quest to determine their future - headed between the attic or a daycare center. If you've enjoyed the way the first two films blend character drama with innovative action and humor, this cocktail hits its stride in the third film, which draws on everything we already know about the characters and then adds two new entire sets of toys to the plot. There's a new villain, two very amusing romance sub-plots and a litany of visual gags that push the envelope even further. I'm not allowed to go into any details but the second half of the film is a familiar set piece performed in a completely new way that will forever change your view of certain toys and day care centers.Apart from a level of animation that sets the bar in the industry and an attention to detail that makes you wonder what most ""real"" films actually do in pre-production, the real genius of the third film is to provide a satisfying conclusion that gives every character a completed character arc. About 20 minutes before the end, I was wondering how they would do this since there were some fairly dark moments (similar to those in Wall-E and Up), but naturally they manage to pull it together. There's literally not a single wasted shot, let alone a wasted scene, and the pace quickens throughout to keep the tension mounting.Overall, this is another Pixar classic that easily has enough for both kids and adults (and movie aficionados). It's not difficult to see why each of their movies takes five years to complete - yet despite the technical wizardry, the success of their movies is fundamentally routed in their stories, a fact which most other studios seem to forget these days. As to whether the stage is set for Toy Story 4, I suppose they could always pull it off given the creativity at work here, but I think there was a deliberate attempt to make this the last in the series.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

I can't believe she would just... THROW ME AWAY,"Andy is moving to college and the toys face some difficult choices.Toy Story 3 is my favourite of the franchise for an excellent combination of visuals, story, comedy and emotion.The plot follows a familiar structure where the characters have another enjoyable adventure together. You would not think the emotion of Toy Story 2 could be matched, but arguably this one is even better. The feelings the toy characters have, particularly Woody, again substitute for the love of parents for children. This is captured incredibly well by Andy's transition into adulthood and the loss felt by Woody. Also from Andy's perspective you feel him saying goodbye to his childhood through the toy characters and it chokes you up.For me it is the funniest film of the franchise. Barbie and Ken steal lots of scenes that I never get tired of watching. Other characters have very funny moments, such as Buzz in Spanish mode and all the prison movie tributes with the likes of Chatter Telephone and Mr Potatohead.Although the animation was incredible in the previous movies, it goes up a notch again with so much wonderfully detailed and textured 3D imagery. The movement of numerous action sequences is as slick as it comes.As ever in Toy Story movies, the voice performers deliver great dialogue brilliantly. The regular cast are excellent, but the addition of the people like Jodi Benson, Michael Keaton and Ned Beatty is superb.It's a 9.5/10 for me but I round upwards.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Toy Story 3 brings the emotional depth so you bring the box of tissues.,"This is a kid's movies for adults. To me, Toy Story 1 is my favorite Toy Story of them all (which is three). It was a film about the relationship between Andy and his toys, much like Toy Story 2's plot. This story focuses on the relationships but in an abstract way, the toys end up going through an evil, cuddly teddy bear and a garbage incinerator to try return to Andy, who in turns hands over his beloved toys to another young human who he knows will take care of them like he did. For me, the film lacked the humanity that the previous two films had, and tried to make up with through action and humor, though it took away from the characters and emotions. Overall I found it a befitting end to an awesome and potential genre defining animated trilogy. I love this film and hope you will too.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"A Bittersweet Conclusion, But Not My Favorite","Toy Story 3 is often celebrated as a fitting and emotional conclusion to the beloved Toy Story trilogy.

The movie is known for its poignant themes of change, loss, and letting go.However, despite the widespread acclaim, Toy Story 3 didn't have the same impact on me. While the film does a good job of wrapping up the story, the emotional beats felt a bit forced, and the plot, though engaging, didn't capture my interest as much as I had hoped. The characters are as likable as ever, but the story itself felt somewhat predictable, and I didn't connect with it on a deeper level.For fans of the series, Toy Story 3 is likely a satisfying conclusion, but for me, it didn't leave a lasting impression.

still warms my heart.,"this movie still hits deep into our emotions. and it really shows how shallow our culture and society has become to some extent. the love of our childhood given to these objects, how easily we can dismiss and replace them and change with little thought. i still remember many of my fav toys from my days. and still have some, granted in a box in garage. but they can so easily bring back wonder memories. sure there are billions of Barbies out there, but it is not the one you had.the end scene, still brings a tear to my eye. i've done once, pass on something of emotional value to a younger generation. one can only hope the gift is continued in some way.of course the dump scene, showing how strong friendship can be. truly story telling at it's best.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Play Time Comes Alive,"For 16 years the Toy Story franchise has captivated a whole sleuth of generations with two amazing films. In almost two decades, there have been millions of kids rushing back from their schools or quickly opening their bedroom doors after they are gone to double check that their toys are not alive. Toy Story has stood the test of time and has become one of the greatest children films of all time and spurned a fantastic sequel. But how do you top that? Can Toy Story 3 make this one of the most brilliant trilogies?Toy Story 3 sets off 11 years after Toy Story 2 with Andy, Woody and Buzz's owner, all grown up and heading for college. The Toy's fate lies in his hands; trash, attic or donated? After a series of bumbling mistakes, the Toys wind up heading for the seemingly perfect Day-care centre, Sunnyside. Sunnyside is ruled by the lovable bear Lots-o. However, all is not what they seem and the toys suffer a terrifying play time with children way below the appropriate age. What seems like a dream quickly turns into a nightmare for the toys as they head the great escape.Pixar, by now, has learnt each trick into hooking the adults as well as the children and not by turning to subtle dirty humour. What is so wonderful about Toy Story 3 is the experience of childhood that you remember or you are living right now. While we are introduced to so many new characters each one comes with its own quirk that is easily lovable and easily memorable. The quick fire lines don't just appeal to every age; it makes them laugh and chortle. Ken, the doll who has never met a Barbie, is a wonderful inclusion to the Toy Story cast with his vanity, self image but also having a big heart. The villain, without giving anything away, is also reminiscent of Sid and Stinky Pete of the previous films. Not only this but the action is every bit edge of your seat entertainment that left the audience gasping and jumping at every moment. I, for one, will never look at a baby doll in the same way.The most triumphant part of this piece of cinema is how your heartstrings are tugged in each and every way. From the opening sequence to the credits, I have not wept so much in a movie since Up; another Pixar classic. The story and the sadness is told so beautifully that it probably made a few people think twice about throwing away old toys or replacing those who are lost.I'm not saying that Toy Story 3 is without flaws. There are times watching where you feel like you had seen it all before with it's predecessors and at some parts the film does becomes predictable. But that is where the classic Pixar genius enters giving enough twists to keep you hooked on till the end.The Toy Store elite films are delightful and to dismiss them as children's films would be an outrage. I found more shock, love, terror, comedy and intrigue that most ""art"" and ""sophisticated"" films are missing. The greatest trilogy of all time? It would be foolish for me to say. But this is definitely up in the big leagues and will last from infinity and beyond.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Infinity and BEYOND!!!!!,"Here is a MSN conversation I had with a friend on this movie after I just saw it, and I think that it pretty much sums up how I felt about this movie:Bob says: Whats up?Dan says: Nun much just saw TS3Bob says: ts3?Dan says: Toy story 3Bob says: oh weirdoDan says: Wah?

This movie is about toys.,"The main characters are toy who have will. Woody who is cow boy live in Andy's house. He is Andy's favorite toy. Andy always say that Woody is my best friend. This movie is about incidents about toys. We can easily sympathy with these toys. Because we see the world as toy's view. In TOY STORY 1, Andy is a child. However in TOY STORY 3, Andy becomes a university student. 1 and 2, we enjoy toy's adventure. However 3rd one describes the relationship Andy with Woody. The main remarkable point is that enemy is also toy. We can see a parting child with toy. Also we remember the time when we were children. This movie moves our heart.

GREAT movie but too scary for small children,"This movie really has it all - belly-laughs, wonderful animation, sly observation - the list goes on. But it's also extremely frightening in places and I wouldn't want to be the mother of a five year old during - or for several years after - taking it to see this film! There is a real air of threat hanging over our trusty Toys for much of the film, and some genuinely dark and scary villains. Of course, children's films have long been peopled by menacing characters - the Child Catcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Cruella Deville etc - but the baddies in Toy Story 3 have less of the cartoon and more of the nightmare about them, and I found them quite chilling.It's also a bit of a tear-jerker on several levels - for adults as well as children! - and if you take children to this one, expect to deal with the fallout of tears and fears for a while afterwards! Also, the movie's 3D version is a big waste of money. The most noticeable thing in 3D was the subtitles, and I wouldn't waste my money on the extra expense of a 3D experience on this one.Despite all the dire warnings above though, I can't recommend this film highly enough. It was more emotionally involving than any live-action film I've seen this year. It's a very long time since I actually GASPED in a movie!

The Greatest Movie Ever Made,The Greatest Movie Ever Made with the best villain and ending ever. It can be enjoyed by people of all ages. I cry every time I watch this movie. No movie will ever be better than Toy Story 3.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Clever, innovative, touching, sweet; a triumph on every level","Marvelous on every level; Toy Story 3 exemplifies the true spirit of movie making. Just a joy to watch, and a pleasant gem to think and talk about afterword. The Toy Story franchise is arguably the best at maintaining its freshness. Same concept, story arc, and characters, but each chapter has its own personality and theme.This film's sentiment reminded me of a piece of poetry I read as a child I've never forgotten; it spoke of the plight of some abandoned toys in a child's bedroom. With heart-wrenching warmth, it described each toy's faithful and longing vigil as they all awaited the return of the child who had once made their lives so joyful, but who had ""one day, disappeared."" Had the child died? In a way; the child was gone forever, having made that inevitable passage to adulthood. In the same way, Andy, no longer the little boy who once took Buzz and Woody on wild fantasy adventures, is moving on to his adult life (college).There is a very healthy mixture of all the elements that have made the Toy Story characters so endearing. The topical humor is still top-notch caliber, but they also capture your heart this time with heart felt sentimentality. They show a deep caring for one another that is not only refreshing to see, but believably and sweetly presented. More than once, characters stick their necks out to help one another. Big Baby was a wonderful addition to the group; anybody who doesn't feel anything during Baby's cries of anguish needs to get a heart transplant.It's a spectacular collaboration of vivid artwork, exquisite visuals, ingenious plot development, penetrating emotion, and excellent voice talent. Fine movies always have memorable moments, and this film has plenty: The back-stories are tenderly told. The toxic dump sequence is an astounding grand finale of emotion, action, and suspense. The scene featuring Andy and Bonnie is inspired. The final image is deeply moving. This film not only lives up to the lofty standards the franchise has already established for itself, it even exceeds them. The best art is that which paints an image of the human condition with truth and beauty. Toy Story is all that and more.Recommended for anyone. This is the kind of movie that you stay in the theater after it's over for a few moments, hoping for more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"Technially excellent, good storyline, but.....","I have got to admit that I am constantly bemused by the way people rate movies.Toy Story 3 is without doubt technically brilliant, has a good storyline and leaves the viewer with an adequate 'feel-good' factor having watched it. But come-on, after spending 200,000,000 on it, isn't this kind of expected?For me, the most important contributing factor to how a movie should be rated has to do with its 're-watch-ability' - you do think you will re-watch a particular movie any time soon, and if so, what about more than once?This is where Toy Story 3 bombs with me.Having watched Toy Story 1 & 2 a single time, I can honestly say that I will also not be watching Toy Story 3 anytime soon.Yet this movie rates higher, often much higher, than all of the following movies, all of which I have watched multiple times already and would readily re-watch again. So, off the top of my head, and with the 'best' first;Terminator 1,2. Avatar. Matrix 1. Fight Club. Oh Brother Where Art Thou. Back To The Future 1,2,3. Blade Runner. The Fifth Element. As Good As It Gets. Moon. Inception. Zoolander.That's a few that in my opinion are far better movies that Toy Story 3, yet the official IMDb stats here in no way reflect this.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
This is not supposed to be rated G movie,"This movie is overflown with grim/gloom/scary messages and situations, not suitable for kids till at least age of 10-12, when they may actually start appreciating some of the dark humor. I would estimate it at least 75% being like that, with couple of characters - direct candidates for younger kids nightmares. I'm merely astonished by glorious reviews!.. I can accept the fact that it might be somewhat amusing for older (even adults) audience, but why would it be rated G then?! Sorry, this was not fun, neither for me nor for my seven year old.

This Entry Almost Makes It A Perfect Trilogy,"For my money Toy Story could be as close to a perfect Trilogy as you will ever get. This third outing is on par with the brilliant last movie which I adored.Plot In A Paragraph: Set several years after the events of ""Toy Story 2"" Andy is now 17 and ready to head off to college, leaving Woody, Buzz, Jessie, and the rest of the toy-box gang to ponder their uncertain futures. He decides to take Woody with him, but Buzz and the gang are put in a black bag to go in the attic. When the toys are accidentally donated to the Sunnyside Daycare Center they're overjoyed to once again be played with, but their joy quickly gives way to horror as they learn the true nature of the establishment under the rule of the deceptively welcoming ""Lotso"" Huggin Bear. Now, all of the toys must band together in one final, crazy mission to escape their confines and return home before Andy leaves.All the cast are again brilliant with Ned Beatty and Michael Keaton joining the fun this time around.This is fantastic, funny, action packed, tension filled and heartbreaking all in equal measure. I'm not going to lie I shed a tear or twenty at the end. It's not giving too much away when I say, as the gang sat holding hands accepting their fate towards the finale, I had tears streaming down my face, and they remained till the final credits rolled.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pixar pulled it off yet again,"Let me start off by saying that I am not a fan of sequels. Never have been. The idea of squeezing a few more bucks out of people by rehashing a successful title, I find despicable. Even though I am a Pixar fan, I thought ""Toy Story 2"" was their weakest release to-date. But THIS movie, well, this is a work of art on its own right. Calling it a sequel is like saying that ""Wicked"" is a prequel to The Wizard of Oz. The love to the characters and the story shines through every scene, and the emotions the movie invokes are genuine: you will laugh, you will cry, and you will sometimes do the two simultaneously. The folks at Pixar continue to amaze me by topping both their CGI abilities and their storytelling abilities each and every time. Here, CGI highlights include clutter, voluminous light and fire effects. (When I watched James Cameron's Avatar I distinctly recall thinking ""well, they've got the water, fabric and skin right. I guess we'll have to wait until Pixar makes a fire movie in order to see realistic CGI flames..."") Clutter we already saw much of in Wall-E, and other stuff (fur, facial expressions, gravity, wind, etc.) that Pixar pioneered in earlier films now take their places in the background, making the world of ""Toy Story 3"" much more real and large than in earlier movies, without upstaging anything.I will not go into the storytelling for fear of spoiling any surprises, but I will say this: it is good. Humor, action, relationships, story, pacing - everything finds its place here, and even though one would rightfully say that parts of the plot have been rehashed from earlier Toy Story movies, Pixar did take (as it always does) some risks with the plot, and these risks paid off: the story comes together better than ever.Pixar returns to its roots here. The movie, tone-wise, is far from Pixar's latest installments, but in this return to the roots Pixar continues to show that it did not lose its mastery in the art of animation storytelling. The CGI, spectacular though it is, does not serve as an excuse for making a ""like live-action only animated"" movie. Every character - from Ken the doll to Slinky Dog - is explored for its graphic/physical potential and how this reflects its own emotionality and its relationship with the other characters. In short: an animator's dream.I had lots of fun watching this movie. It's been a while since I've been able to say that.Two thumbs up from me. I don't know how Pixar does it every time, but the folks there certainly pulled it off yet again, setting a new bar for all others to gawk at and envy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Not my favorite but one of my favorites. And will ever be if not Pixar or any other studio unlikely makes a movie better than this masterpiece.This is, i gotta say...Its freaking amazing.

A Truly Excellent Sequel,"All truly great sequels have one thing that makes them work extremely well, and that one thing is progression. It's why Spider Man 2 and X-men 2 were better than their prequels. And this is exactly what works so well with Toy Story 3. The film manages to maintain it's previous level of humor and excitement, while presenting a new story that fits perfectly with a series that some of us have grown up with.Much like many of the children who have watched these films, our new Toy Story sees Andy all grown up and ready for college. And for Woody, Buzz, and the rest of the gang, that means that it's time to start moving on. Buzz isn't quite ready to give that life up yet, and he seems to be the only one that Andy is taking along. The rest of the gang eventually find themselves donated to a day care center, which turns out to be worse than the toys could have anticipated, and it's up to Woody to save the gang.In it's first hour, the film drags a bit. The jokes aren't quite as funny as they could be, as I didn't laugh quite as much as I laughed during the first two films. But the film is still highly entertaining, and this is one G rated film that everyone should be able to get behind. The story of Andy growing up and moving on is also a perfect direction for the film. It not only speaks of these characters, but it speaks of everyone involved, both behind the film and the audience. It's one final goodbye to our friends in what is probably one of the most successful animation franchises ever. And it's this theme of growing up, moving on, and starting over that carries the second half into perfection. There are moments in this second half that had me on the verge of tears, and I rarely ever cry at a movie.The plot beyond the themes is great, a homage to prison break movies, with the toys becoming prisoners of the day care center and the subsequent escape. And the new villain, Lotso, is a great sympathetic antagonist who is not without his reasons for who he is. The film is filled with entertaining set pieces, my particular favorite being a scene involving a tortilla that had me in tears of laughter. So, while the jokes are sometimes hit and miss (although mostly hit), there are times when the film is extremely funny.The voice work here is as good as ever and it's hard to believe that the actors have been away for so long, because it feels like they never left these characters. I almost feel like they sometimes just sit around with each other and do a Toy Story roundabout every once in a while.There isn't enough good praise that can be said about these characters. Sure, the film drags its feet a little and retreads previous territory, but these are very minor in the face of the glaringly excellent things it does so right. Where Iron Man 2 may be the summer's best blockbuster, this is the summer's first great film, and is everything we have been asking for from our movies since the start.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
An evening with old friends...,"Toy Story 3 will go down in history as being one of the (very) rare sequels that genuinely builds on the story of its original.The original Toy Story is an iconic movie, the way The Wizard of Oz was in the thirties. It took a medium that few of us had much faith in, and proved it could be used to tell a fun, involving story.Toy Story 2 wound up taking an interesting turn, becoming a kind of contemplation on the difference between being loved and being revered. Fortunately, the characters stayed true, and the sense of fun remained.While TS3 extends that sense of fun (particularly with new characters like the Ken doll), there is a mournful quality to it that adults will recognize as a sense of mortality. As the movie starts, the toys make an ingenious but ultimately pathetic bid for their owner's attention; they know they are being left behind and possibly discarded. The story is really driven by the toys' efforts to come to terms with that change.It is, at times, fun, inventive, and even thrilling. It says something about the relationship we've had with these characters that when they face certain peril at the climax of the story, their simple response is surprisingly moving.It's that relationship that makes this such a great sequel. Since the original Toy Story was released in 1995, CGI animation has become an important segment of the industry, and the source of some of my favourite films of the past 15 years. I left the theatre thinking about how far the medium has come in that time, and that this movie felt like an evening with old friends.While Disney/Pixar hasn't declared this to be the ""last"" of the series, the story arc closes so gracefully that you'd hate to see it embellished simply for the sake of box-office receipts.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Certainly Lives Up to Everything You've Heard,"Toy Story 3 (2010)**** (out of 4)Andy is about to go to college so he must start cleaning out his room and packing up what he wants to take with him while everything else goes to the attic. His toys accidentally get put in the trash pile and soon wind up in a daycare where they think Andy has thrown them away but it's up to Woody to convince them that Andy still loves them. Hearing too much hype about a film can often lead a viewer to walk away disappointed as the hype usually gets in the way of one actually enjoying a film to its fullest level. I had heard so many great things about TOY STORY 3 that I was rather skeptical even though I enjoyed the first two movies. I'm glad to say this is one example where the film certainly lived up to the hype and actually managed to be better than everything I had heard. While I still think UP is a better movie this one here has a terrific story, a wonderful imagination and some truly great moments including the final twenty-minutes, which contain just about every type of emotion that you could hope for. At the same time I'd add that this movie is certainly more for adults than it is kids because I can imagine that the ending would have many young kids traumatized due to the suspenseful scene where the toys end up in the garbage and are about to fall into a burning pit of fire. The sequence is beautifully done and heartfelt but at the same time I had to remind myself that this was a kids movie but then again Spielberg's E.T. had this same type of drama and I viewed it as a child just like so many kids will be viewing this film. The final twenty-minutes, which I won't ruin, are downright brilliantly directed and you can't help but smile at how the film ends. The film is a beautiful tribute to the impact toys can have on a kids life and how one feels when they must finally give them up. I thought the screenplay did a terrific job at highlighting this but it also made the wise decision to have all the toys in the action. Woody, Buzz, the Potato Heads, Slinky Dog and the rest of the gang are back but we have several new toys including the bad bear with the voice of Ned Beatty. Hanks, Tim Allen and the rest of the gang do their typical great work but Beatty really does a marvelous job and nearly steals the film as one second he can be lovable but the next second downright evil. The visual effects keep getting better and better and the ones here are certainly the best I've seen to date. The opening sequence really puts you in the middle of the action and the gauntlet known as the day care was so perfectly done that you can't help but look at it in amazement. TOY STORY 3 has just about everything going for it and every simple thing is done with great detail and imagination. The movie is certainly the best of the trilogy and it ends the series in a perfect way.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Sorry to say but, meh","Now you might call me a ""Hater"", but the fact is im not really. I came into the theater with VERY high expectations, so i was disappointed. Not terribly, but a bit. The movie just didn't have that final kick which ranks it among other great pixar movies and its predecessors. I LOVED Toy story 1 and 2, but this one didn't quite make the jump. The emotions got sorta cheesy and it would have ended way better if they were burned in the garbage place. Call me evil, but i don't actually wanna see them die. It would have just been a really good metaphor for departing from Andy. But then all the kids would have cried so obviously they couldn't do it.To sum up: Animation: good, Dialouge: okay, plot: okay but meh So its a 6/10, fine but could have been better",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Great third version of a successful series!,"I've decided to watch toy story 3 because i was a fan of the previous two toy stories and I thought those were really well done and had great stories. Toy Story 3 proves that the third film of a series does not have to be the weakest and that it can sometimes even be the strongest. Toy Story 3 is just as magical as the first two offerings and the quality of the animation is second to none. Now I don't necessarily remember exactly what happens in the previous two toy stories but I remember liking them a lot and how the stories were great. I feel that Toy Story 3 is the best out of the 3. Toy Story was great but the third one does it the best, in my opinion.All the same toys are back but this time their are new toys (some good, some bad). Unlike the previous toy stories, this one is filled with more frightening scenes and more mature themes. This one is also more darker and some scenes can scare little kids slightly, but that's what makes it great. I was surprised that their were some scenes like that, after reading some comments from critics and reviews. This movie isn't really for young children but it all depends on their views.

Missed target audience by a mile,"This is not a movie for young children. New characters are villains in the guise of toys, sections of the film are dark and too scary for toddlers, and rarely will you hear children laugh during this film.

Past experience with Toy Story movies and other Pixar products had us hoping for an enjoyable movie and this was anything but.

The commercials made it seem that the movie had way too much time and money put into it, but all of the time, money and energy put into it really paid off. It is one of my favorite movies of all time. It does have its flaws. I mean, it didn't have many of the characters featured in the previous movies, but there are more good things than bad.

"A fun and cutesy but unfortunately sleep inducing movie, unsuitable for kids","A formula is great thing, it helps you solve complex problems in a simplistic, time efficient manner but unfortunately the same is not true for movie making and once again Pixar has used the same old Toy Story formula of ""save my plastic back(side)"" in this movie too. A movie which starts pleasantly dims off to a sleep inducing monotone by the end and you find yourself scratching your head thinking ""déjà vu"" by the middle but because you're in a cinema you keep quiet and lull yourself off into a numb surrender instead.The movie entrées with the toys all warring with each other and before you gasp in horror and disbelief or question why you realise it's just Andy playing with his toys, probably for the last time since he's going to college soon. The sequence is creative and playful and forces out a chuckle or two, but as soon as it's over things go pear shaped. Queue the separation sequence. Whereas in previous Toys Stories it's one toy lost, everybody save, it seems the bigger budget and new technology has helped Pixar to think outside their box a little, but still only just far enough to keep them still sitting in its shadow. Instead of one toy lost, it's now many toys lost and instead of everybody helps to save one toy lost, it's now one toy saves the playground (so to speak) and hey presto you have your classic Hollywood ""one man saves the world"" movie, but with toys instead.The classic characters are all still ""real"" and believable and no one is missing (which is good), the new toys are also very well done, funny and how you would probably imagine them to be if they were really alive (how cool would that be!). The voiceovers are great and the humans are surprisingly well done too, unlike TS1 and TS2 where detail to them was cunningly skimmed over.Again, things turn nasty with the introduction of Mr Hitler pink teddy! A predictably kind and wise old ring leader with evil eugenically inspired intentions, the textbook villain for our hero toys to escape from and all the while wholly inappropriate for the young in the auditorium! A quick glance at my neighbours qualified the fact that if this sequence had gone on any longer we would have had a few crying kids on our hands. And the terminator Chucky doll didn't exactly help roses bloom in my heart!Basically, Pixar has pulled an offensive hand gesture to their target audience on this one and just regurgitated and older toy story with 3D effects. Which on further inspection was shamefully weak and uninspiring anyway; as I have had said before, I don't want to be sitting with my face melting in my hand during a 3D movie, get the audience moving, ducking and dodging! I for one would expect the medium of animation as one which can truly stretch this technology to its limits (again, go watch the 3D show at Thorpe park), seems like Hollywood is fresh out of revolutionaries and there are now none to the likes of the Wachowski Brothers left.My advice and closing comment, if you are ten or less, you'll be crying watching this so get mummy or daddy to fast forward the scary bits and if you're a parent your nippers will be crying, so fast forward the scary bits, if you're a teenager or anything else you'll probably enjoy this movie, more so if you're tipsy or have an IQ <100.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Third sequel to a very successful franchise that has yet to stop surprising us with its captivating stories of emotion!,"At the same level as the predecessors, only with much more humor and fun and a spectacular outcome.

As good as or better than the first 2,"There's a law in moiveology, much like Isaac Newton's laws of motion. Well call this the law of sequels. It is stated: As a franchise accumulates sequels the value of each successive film approaches crap. However, as in all fields of science, when a movie arises that contradicts our laws and theories, no matter how well founded they may appear to be, we must revise our old ways of thinking in exchange for the new. This is one of those times.Go see Toy Story 3.Toy Story 3 contains some of the most powerful and emotionally resonate scenes of the Toy Story franchise, yet is also so funny that you may need to bring an extra pair of pants (and not just for the little ones). It has its flaws, although they detract little from the film. This rare sequel ties in so organically with the first two films that you'd be amazed to realize that the Toy Story franchise was never intended to be a trilogy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
My favorite in the series,"This movie released at a time where I considered myself too old to watch cartoons. But as a huge fan of the first two Toy Story movies I had to go see this one out of curiosity. I didn't read any reviews, I had no idea what the plot was about. Little did I know that Andy was all grown up and basically going through the same thing as I was as the time. I entered the movie theatre with little to no expectations but to my surprise I found myself crying at the end.. I actually stood up and cheered when it was done, something I would normally never do. It left an impact to say the least. It remains my favorite in the series, I dare say it's even better than the original. It may actually be my favorite animated movie of all times. If this doesn't make you feel anything you are dead inside.12/10!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Movie for Everyone, not just kids!","Beginning part was a bit boring but when you almost get to near the end of the movies, I swear I actually started sobbing. No movie has ever made me sob besides this one. This is the movie guaranteed to make you cry, and I'm not the kind of person to cry during movies, but this one did! It's a must see movie,watch it by yourself, watch it with your family, watch it with your dog,watch it with your neighbor!!! You just need to see it!This is a must see movie! But first watch the first two movies before you watch Toy Story 3 because you'll pretty much be very very VERY disappointed if you don't know the plot of the first and second movies.

Lotsa Chuckles and Genius,"Greetings again from the darkness. Has there ever been a bad Pixar movie? Nope. And as many really good movies they have created, there are now two truly great ones: Toy Story and Toy Story 3. The first one (released 15 years ago) transformed the way animation is made and set the standard for kids' movies that parents can also enjoy. This third installment takes animated story telling to the next level.Of course all the great voices are back: Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz (Tim Allen), Jessie (Joan Cusack), Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head (Don Rickles, Estelle Harris), Rex (Wallace Shawn), Hamm (John Ratzenberger) and Sarge (R Lee Ermey). Imagine assembling that cast and then adding two fabulous new characters: Lotsa Huggin' Bear (Ned Beatty), Ken (Michael Keaton; expanding Jodi Benson's Barbi to a key role, and re-vamping Slinky-dog with Blake Clark taking over for his deceased friend, the fabulous Jim Varney. This is major star power and an over-abundance of talent!Then again, we have all seen stellar casts fall flat without a worthy script. Fear not as Pixar legend John Lasseter (Exec Producer here) has passed the reins again to director Lee Unkrich (Toy Story 2, Finding Nemo, Monsters, Inc.). This story is brilliant and engaging. I challenge anyone from age 5 to 95 to avoid being drawn in to the themes of separation, friendship, loyalty, and power.There are some laugh outloud moments along with the usual wise cracks from Buzz and Potato head. This time we are also treated to some darker moments with Lotsa, a power-hungry stuffed bear, and his band of misfits that include a giant baby doll and Chuckles, the creepiest clown this side of Poltergeist, and especially the frightening/funny monkey working security.Some Pixar touches include the voice of Andy is provided by the grown up voice actor who did Andy in the first, a couple of glimpses of the evil kid Sid (first Toy Story) who has grown up to be a garbage man (same shirt) and the re-use of Randy Newman's classic song ""You've Got a Friend in Me"". Too many other ""little"" moments to mention, but this is pure film genius and should not be missed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Overrated Corny Fun!,"Toy Story 3 is not a bad movie by any means, however it is without a shred of a doubt overrated. Although I do not personally love this movie I can certainly see why people do, because we're this movie succeeds is were the other two do. As a matter a fact that's sorta the genus of Toy Story. This is a trilogy that grew up with its viewers. The first one came out when we were blown away with cgi, the second came when we wanted more emotion with our animation, and this one came when we were all grown up. With that said Toy Story 3 is pretty much just good old fashioned corn, with a lot of heart.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A troubling sign of Pixar's direction to come.,"Let me start off by saying that I don't hate Toy Story 3, but in a decade (2001 up to 2010) where Pixar produced no sequels and instead had many strong individual films that even when not perfect, still stood solidly on their own (Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Cars, Ratatouille, Wall-E, Up), why would you choose to end that decade with another Toy Story movie?It's not even that I necessarily disagree with a follow-up to any pre-existing stories, it's that it just feels so weird when aside from Toy Story 2, the studio had been known (at least to me) as a fantastic team of artists and writers who were able to craft grand new stories, and each new film also employed a new piece of technology that hadn't quite been explored in computer generated imagery yet.Monsters, Inc. Had the addition of moving, squishing, swaying fur, Finding Nemo experimented with the many situations in which water could be animated, lighted and otherwise displayed.The Incredibles experimented with more overtly cartoonish stylisation of human characters, Cars had cars in it.Ratatouille tried (and mostly succeeded at) bringing appealing food on the virtual table.Wall-E experimented with some of the most realistic CG scenery the studio had put out to date.Pixar was, at least in my eyes, established as a trendsetting studio that broke new ground with each new release and actively employed new graphical features and technology in the pursuit of technical advancement in computer-generated animation, while also allowing each film produced with them to have its own unique feeling and vibe.Let's just say that I felt left out with the release of Toy Story 3.I didn't go out of my way to see it because I just had no active interest in seeing another sequel from Pixar.It's not even that I disliked Toy Story 2; I actually really appreciated the further character study of Woody and Buzz's personalities.It was a perfectly fine movie that never felt like a copy of the original.Eventually, over a year after its release, I did take a chance to see Toy Story 3.And it just felt like watching a less cohesive Toy Story 2 to me.It wasn't that anything in particular bothered me, initially.But I had seen some great stuff at my age then.I had been greatly surprised by the refreshing qualities of How To Train Your Dragon from Dreamworks earlier, I had had a chance to see more new material from Studio Ghibli like Ponyo on the Cliff.But eventually I came to realise what bothered me about the film: it had little identity to call its own.It took the structure from Toy Story 2, changed a few details around, convoluted a few plot conveniences to give us a highly emotional fake-out towards the end.It felt manipulative, insincere, and coldly calculated.And it's never been the case that I felt that way with a Pixar film.I hypothesise that Disney's acquisition of Pixar had something to do with it, but fine, after so many great movies I guess they'll learn their lesson and continue to make great original movies after this.Which, of course, they did.In between Cars 2, Monsters University, Finding Dory, Cars 3, Incredibles 2, Toy Story 4 (WHY?), Pixar produced many more great original films like The Good Dinosaur (the most remembered Pixar movie of all time).At an assembly line, forced to churn out sequels on the side to keep Disney's corporate vampires happy and likely leading to heavy crunch which could one day destroy the entire studio if left unchecked in its escalation.I actually don't think this is a bad movie.It's got some nice moments, it's got some nice interplay between characters both old and new and of course the visuals are gorgeous.Though I can't help but feel that Pixar as a studio would have been better off if it had been a flop.Closing the door for sequels and giving the studio more time and resources to focus on their new films would have been a great deal for them in hindsight.Alas, what wallets that vote.PS: The Totoro plush was so cute it brought the score up by three points just by itself.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Unkrich takes rein and flies the Pixar flag with confidence and conviction.,"At the end of my review of Toy Story 2 (1999), I challenged Pixar to ""convince us (with Toy Story 3)that we have been frozen in carbonite all these years, that we haven't really aged at all."" I am extremely delighted to say that Pixar has done it again. Director Lee Unkrich takes rein and flies the Pixar flag with confidence and conviction. The co-director of Toy Story 2, Monsters, Inc. (2001) and Finding Nemo (2003), Unkrich finally proves that he has what it takes to be fully in charge of a Pixar picture.Toy Story 3, I would guess, is the last installment of a very remarkable trilogy, which in modern cinema, is perhaps only bettered by Peter Jackson's action-fantasy epic The Lord of the Rings (2001-2003). Its success also breaks the ""curse of the third film"" that has plagued popular series such as Spiderman, The Matrix, Pirates of the Caribbean, and maybe even Shrek. Pixar's eleventh straight box-office hit, Toy Story 3 is the epitome of consistency, not only for the famed animation studio, but for animation cinema as well.If there is a minor blip, Toy Story 3 is the least original in the series. Visually, it is arguably the most creative. But plot-wise, it copies the structure of its direct prequel. An action-packed prologue in which the toy character(s) live out their (or their owner's) fantasy? Check. Meeting of new toys in which one of them appears to be kind but is actually wicked? Check. A flashback sequence that details the fate of a toy? Check. Indiana Jonesque action and adventure in another great escape? Check.Nevertheless, it is still very entertaining to see Woody and co. pick up from where they left off eleven years ago. They have not lost any character trait, nor our love for them diminished over the years. The story goes like this: Andy is all grown up and going to college soon. The toys fear that they will become unwanted and unloved. They are then accidentally donated to a day-care center, to their delight of course, where children could play with them. Their enjoyment turns into horror when they realize that at night, the center becomes a prison controlled by a gang of ""veteran toys"".Toy Story 3 is less funny (dialogue-wise), has less film references, but hits the jackpot with great character interplay, of which the most memorable ones include that of Buzz and Jessie, and Barbie and Ken, most of them of a romantic nature. Many of the action set-pieces are thrilling (and sometimes frightening) including one involving a garbage incinerator in which the fear of death brings a collective sense of identity that has never been exhibited to such a heart-wrenching extent in a Pixar film.Unkrich leaves the very best for the last. The final act is touching, with enough emotional resonance to warm even the coldest heart. The younger viewers in which the film is targeted at may not be old enough to appreciate the nuances. But adults who tag along with them, and children who grew up with Toy Story (many of whom are now slightly older than Andy) will find tears in their eyes as they recollect memories of childhood that now look like a distant afterthought. Suffice to say, Toy Story 3 is a definite shoo-in for one of the top ten films of 2010.SCORE: 9/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The Pixar crew do it again!,"Just come back from a preview screening in Auckland, New Zealand.This movie is quite simply perfect. From the opening sequence to the end credits this movie delivers in spades! There is something for everyone - those who have grown up with Toy Story, to those who've never seen the film before.Their really is nothing negative to say, other than don't bother spending the extra to see it in 3D - it offers nothing that you wouldn't have got in 2D, in fact the group I went to see the film with actually all agreed in someway it actually detracted from the enjoyment of the film, but you decide!Anyway, great film and wonderful ending to one history's truly great trilogies. 8.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A warm testament to everyone's fondest childhood memories,"I found Toy Story 3 to be, easily, one of the most touching movies I've ever seen. The series followed my generation; I grew up with Toy Story 1 and 2, and now as I myself am heading off to college, I couldn't have asked for a better, more poignant ending than Toy Story 3. The familiarity of the characters coupled with inevitable, generational continuity, creates one of Pixar's finest works. It speaks to the warm ache of nostalgia, to die-hard loyalty, to the acceptance of change. Of course, it wouldn't have been a true Pixar film if it didn't make the audience laugh out loud every few minutes. And when Andy played with his toys for the last time at the end of the movie... my god, I cried like a baby.Cinematic, animated brilliance.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
ohhhhhh... Perfection,"As we all know, back 1995, the first 3D animated film made history becoming (at least in my book) the greatest animated film of all time. Following another Toy Story in 1999, which was also a success in the franchise. Now today on 2010, we get the third installment, and thus creating the best animated film trilogy the world has ever known.It's fun, it's funny, well directed and well written. May not be as good as the first one but I feel it's better than the 2nd one. For it's story it's surprising to see such a great introduction for each new character and for each one to have a unique personality, that stays true to the franchise, such a richly scripted movie. If there's a company that really knows how to do good animated films it's Pixar.Such good and fascinating animation and story, making this the best animated film of the year. With a great ending that made me tear a little but it's touching and it makes you think. I never thought a G rated movie would make and entire audience cry, even adults were sniffling and weeping, how is that even possible?!

Never Toy With What Works.,"The toys find themselves at a day-care facility after their rightful owner goes away to college. All seems fine at first, but there are issues abound as our heroes get settled into their new lives. A bit darker entry in the vastly popular series still delivers in the end as we have top-of-the-line animation mixed with superior story-telling, focused direction, and amazingly humanistic characters who seem like complex caricatures of their voiced alter egos. Pixar's original ""Toy Story"" continues to be the high watermark not only for animated features, but for most all films produced and in the end ""Toy Story 3"" meets and exceeds all requirements necessary to stand next to its original inspiration.

"Nothing new, but very cute","What made Toy Story so great was the animation. What made Toy Story 2 just as good was the story. Toy Story 3 has no ground breaking animation technology (a la The original) and I think fails to live up to the story of the last two. It wasn't particularly funny like Monsters Inc. It wasn't a super-original plot. It was just a good pixar film (yet again).If you loved the first two and you love everything pixar does...than this will be no exception and you will find this movie simply astounding.

"OK, But Far Below My Expectations","Toy Story 3 has gotten nothing but excellent reviews. Everyone says that it is phenomenal in every way. At the time I am writing this, it's the highest rated Pixar movie here on IMDb.I have been very impressed with several of Pixar's newer films. I thought Cars, Ratatouille, and WALL-E were all great. Up disappointed me by having forgettable and stupid action in the second half of the movie. Unfortunately, Toy Story 3 disappoints me in exactly the same way. Most of the second half of the movie is fairly forgettable and irrelevant to the original plot.To compliment the movie, most of it is well-written, humorous, and has great voice acting. The ending is really nice, too. Unfortunately, there are several big scenes that were disappointing. Towards the second half of the movie, the plot begins to drift away from the compelling idea of the toys needing to get back to their owner to the generic ""good vs. evil"" battle. I found this to be unfitting and far less entertaining than the beginning of the film.The climax of the film is fairly evil and intense, which surprised me. I can easily see little kids getting scared by what I thought was going to be a truly all-ages film. (This movie definitely should have been rated PG.) I also felt that by having the evil character not redeem himself, the movie teaches a bad message.For Toy Story and Pixar fans, Toy Story 3 is probably worth watching. If you loved Up, you will probably love this movie just as much if not more. But don't think that this is a perfect movie for the whole family. It might be quite scary for young kids, and I don't think most adults will appreciate it much.Hopefully, this will be the last Pixar film that hurts itself with generic action and an overly evil character. Toy Story 3 is certainly not a bad film, but I know Pixar can do much better.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Technically brilliant and enjoyable but it still left me a bit  flat.,"You should by all means see this film--it is quite enjoyable and Pixar should be proud. And, a week after its debut, the film has earned $2138123413713471035 dollars (more or less)--so it's obviously a huge hit. And, I did enjoy the film....BUT. There's that nagging 'but'...a certain odd something that I felt was lacking in the film. Personally, I STILL prefer ""Toy Story 2"" and ""Up"". I also am a bit concerned whether this is the best film for the youngest members of the audience.Technically speaking, this is probably the best looking CG movie made to this point--though I am sure in the next few years they'll manage to exceed this one--that's the nature of things. There are so many scenes where you just marvel at all the elements--there is just so much to see and your eyes just delight in this. One of the examples are the amazing daycare scenes--with so many toys, kids and knick-knacks about the rooms, you can't believe the Pixar folks could do it! The other is is the scene at Bonnie's yard at the end of the film--the colors, textures and depth were just mind-blowing. It was first-rate in just about every way technically, though the 3-D aspects were very good but not great. Yes, they looked nice but they weren't 100% necessary to the film and didn't seem to use e 3-D to its fullest (like they did in ""How To Train Your Dragon""--a film that did manage to use the 3-D as more than just a nice novelty).As for the plot, I really don't want to recapitulate what's in the film. There have already been a ton of IMDb reviews that have done a very good job of detailing the plot. Instead, let's talk about I think this was actually a bit weak. Sure, the old characters were mostly back and I loved a few of the new ones (Ken was great), but the film had a dark and slightly unsavory element to it that bothered me. A lot of families would naturally bring kids to see it--kids too young not to be terrified. While another recent CG movie was terrifying (""Coraline""), as least it was not rated G and did not have the family-friendly aura about it. In this films, the problems were not like they were in ""Toy Story 2""--whether or not the toys could make it home. Here in ""3"", they not only struggled with this but also were often in jeopardy of being completely destroyed--either shredded or incinerated!! Also, while they didn't bother me at all, a couple of the new characters were downright creepy--such as the baby and the crazed monkey! Yikes--imagining a 3 or 4 year-old seeing this makes my skin crawl! Aside from these concerns, I have to hand it to the film. It was highly manipulative and will make you shed a tear--even if they are only toys! And, it certainly was lovely--real eye-candy!UPDATE: This film just won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature. In addition, it's now #31 on IMDb's Top 250. Considering it's a sequel, I just don't get this....",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Senorita! What a wonder!,"I was glad to find out that my little hometown had decided to put up Toy Story 3 in PVR, and that too in 3D. Hearing this, I left the toilet midway (:P) and rushed to book the tickets for the next available show. 11 years and here it was... Toy Story 3 was officially out in India.Having seen Toy Story 1 and Toy Story 2, the latter being my favourite Pixar production, obviously my expectations were, least to say, 'sky- high'. I must slap myself for doubting them, I must throttle myself for even thinking it, I should get ""lasered"" by a real Buzz Lightyear for being afraid of it, and I must get ""coyboyed"" by Woody for having second thoughts about the result... but guess what. After close to 2 hours of delight, depression, hope, inspiration and a pure heart-warming tale, I suddenly had a new favourite Pixar, and I daresay a new 2nd favourite (nothing beats TDK): Toy Story 3.Funnily enough, the basic central theme of all Toy Story's is the same: Rescue. However, it's HOW the theme is shaped and shelled that makes a movie ""awful"", ""ok"", ""good"", ""great""... or ""Toy Story 3"". I tried to be as cruel to the movie as possible, trying to find mistakes, trying to find a loophole, trying to locate ONE black spot in pure, white, serene beauty, but I couldn't.The Direction: Perfect. Lee has done a wonder job with it. No bumps, no goofs, no feeling of ""What? Why? How?"". Everything is so well explained, so well done, every action and event has an explanation.Music: Makes the movie what it is. Gives it the feel.Script: Wow. Wow. Wow. And wow.Editing: Perfect.Cinematography: Though there isn't any, the sense of cinematography is totally perfect.Voice(s): Oscar winning performances, for the voices at least...Ideas & Concepts: From the most heartwarming scene, to the most threatening scene, to the most touching scene... to the most hilarious scene ever (Buzz! Senorita!). The ideas that are reflected in these scenes... and again the direction... makes you ACTUALLY experience the moment.And finally...The Animation: What can I say... Pixar is already perfect but somehow they're getting better and better. Perfect movements, which create perfect moments, amazing sense of animation, the reflections, the expressions... the... well, everything.But what is it that makes this movie what it is? I don't know. I watched this movie once but I guess that wasn't enough. I'm gonna watch this movie again, again, again and again. But I know that I still won't be able to tell you WHAT it is that makes this movie the wonder it has turned out to be. All I can say is, don't give a DAMN about the price of the ticket, this movie is priceless. Grab the next opportunity, and make way for it if you don't get one, but go, 10-year-olds, 20-year-olds, 40- year-olds, 80-year-olds... there's something in there for everybody. Go.

Slightly disappointed,"Was expecting better, to be honest... basically just another ""toys don't listen to Woody, toys get in trouble and wish they had listened to Woody, Woody has to rescue them"" storyline, with a necessary, but rather predictable ending tacked on to round off the series.There were also very few ""grown-up"" jokes for the adults in this one compared to other Pixar movies, which was disappointing. The only reason I would buy the DVD is to check out the big 'crowd scenes', as I'm sure there are lots of things going on in the background there that I missed first time around.One plus point was the aliens getting more of starring role in this one, though... they've always been my favourite characters!",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

A good kids movie,"To start off my 9 year old loved this movie. I thought it good for a kids movie. The action and the story kept me interested the chartists are endearing, and the message is a good one. Being blind in one eye makes it impossible to experience the 3d effect so for me the story has to hold me. The only down part is the dark moments in the movie while dramatic and moving still might be a little to frightening for the real little ones. For this and a rather pedestrian story I've seen before I downgrade it a bit.This is the first Toy Story movie I have seen and it endears me to the franchise.

The ending of an excellent childhood,"I don't really know how to describe what this film means to me. When Toy Story came out I was about 4 years old, I bought Woody and Buzz and had both costumes as well. These movies pretty much sum up my childhood and like all good movies the characters stick with you. Every time I watch Toy Story its like visiting old friends I haven't seen in a long time. While this may seem kinda silly(they're freaking toys for pete's sake) it reminds me of being a kid, of when I looked at the world in a less cynical way and probably understood love better than I do today.I am 18 years old now, I'm about to start college and stand on my own two feet. Its as if Pixar planned this perfectly, sure for many it is a nostalgic thing for them, but I feel like I am Andy. I am bidding goodbye to my childhood, to these friends I've known for so long. The beauty of this film is that it nails the truth down about all of us, we remember being kids and sometimes we long to be those kids again.This is a wonderful film and sequel, trust me it has more going for it than just nostalgia. The film has some breath-taking visuals, hilarious humor, and thought provoking moments. A complete trilogy if there ever was one. The ending is pure poetry, not modern poetry but timeless like Emily Dickinson, its not trying to be sad for sadness's sake but is truly moving.

A wonderful way to say goodbye.,"The first Toy Story movie was a milestone in the history of film, being the first ever full-length CG film ever made. And with it's intriguing plot and terrific comedic delivery, coupled with all the elements needed for a great adventure, it was a box-office smash, as was it's sequel. Today, fifteen years later, Woody and co. have come back to the silver screen for one last hurray.Toy Story 3 is set a few years after the events of the second film. Andy, the owner of the toys, is now a young man entering college and hasn't played with his old pals for years. After numerous attempts of getting his attention came to no avail, Woody, Buzz, and the remaining of the toys are resigned to the fact that they aren't going to be played with anymore. When only Woody is picked to follow Andy to college, the rest of the toys seek refuge as donations to Sunnyside Daycare, only to realize that there is more to the place than it seems. Now, Woody must help them escape and convince them that they still have a place in Andy's heart.As with any other Pixar animated films so far, Toy Story 3 carries the same ingenious amount of slapstick comedy which leaves you in laughter and also in awe of it's creativity. The story progresses as a true adventure, as Woody, Buzz and friends maneuver past the countless obstacles with wit and hilarity. Lee Unkrich masterfully displays the imaginative appeal of the first two movies, taking the adventure from a vending machine to within a garbage truck.TS3 boasts one of Pixar's most daring and laudable aspect in making family movies, in the way they shift the story into a darker tone. And this time, they have raised the stakes to unprecedented heights. While The Incredibles and Up play out the dark tones in a way less obvious to children, the theme of the toys being forsaken and forgotten here forgoes the subtlety, and we are shown the tragic back stories of the toys, and fear for their impending doom. There are a few scenes where the toys were faced with certain destruction. Immensely intense and gripping, it left me at the edge of my seat, having invested so much feelings in it.Last but definitely not least is how this movie can affect any individual emotionally. Up till the end, the whole movie had been about having to let go of things, and by the final act, it was about learning to do it. Without revealing too much, let me say that the ending not only offers closure for Andy's emotional attachment, but is also a fitting send off for the icons we have come to know fifteen years ago. It brilliantly evokes a sense of nostalgia not only to the films, but to our very own childhood, where we had so much fun exploring the powers of the imagination to not just our toys, but the unventured world out there.Toy Story 3 maintains the form of the first two films, being a wonderful mix of comedy, adventure, and a message about life. It is an excellent and heartfelt tribute to a franchise that has not only earned a place in history, but a special place in the hearts of so many people. And wherever we go in life, when we look back at these movies, it will be with a smile, rekindling our very own childhood memories.To Infinity and Beyond.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"An emotional, nostalgic, and bittersweet ending to a legendary series","Just under a year ago, Disney re-released Toy Story and Toy Story 2 as a 3D double bill in theatres. I had not seen either film in years despite owning them both on video and DVD, and never had the opportunity to see the sequel theatrically. So I jumped at the chance of seeing both films again. As the films progressed, I felt the nostalgia kicking in at every turn. Both were films that were released when I was still playing with toys, and both still managed to resonate with me now that I was grown up. They made me crave Toy Story 3 unlike any other film this summer, and after seeing Pixar's creative output in the past few years, is there any reason to why I should not have been hyped?Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz (Tim Allen) and the gang (less a few members) are still in Andy's (John Morris) room despite having not been played with for years. Andy has gotten older, and has matured beyond his time playing with toys. They attempt to coax him into playing with them, but he has no time. He is moving away to college, and his mother wants him to pack what he is taking and get rid of the rest. She encourages donating the toys to a local daycare. While Woody is against the idea, everyone else is enthusiastic about being played with again. But after arriving at daycare (without Andy's knowledge), they change their minds quite quickly.Toy Story 3 is just as simplistic as the previous two films, and has the same main goal (return to Andy), but it feels like a much more mature and accomplished work on the part of the filmmakers. It was a wise choice to set the film so many years after Toy Story 2, not just because it has been that long since the film came out, but because it resonates with the audience on a level so much greater than anyone could expect. I mentioned my initial nostalgia when I re-watched the first two films a few months back. All those emotions and feelings came flooding back the moment Toy Story 3 began, and never faded away once. It only became greater as the film went on. And having seen the film in a packed theatre of young adults who were old enough to have seen the original two films when they were kids, I doubt I was the only one who felt this way.The film, much like last year's fantastically brilliant Up, is an adventure unlike any other. Pixar truly has the most creative minds working behind the scenes, and it shows in how wacky and imaginative this film is. It may play on similar themes from the past, but everything old manages to feel new again here. The film may not be as unique or wildly original as Up or WALL-E, but it still has the heart and charm these other Pixar films have. They really are the most consistent company currently making films, and it shows in their increasingly fascinating creative output.What takes away from the greatness and legacy of Toy Story 3 are the jumping tones. This was a problem Up handled quite well in how immediate and focused it was. But with Toy Story 3's increasingly expanding stable of characters and development of new characters like Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear (Ned Beatty) and Ken (Michael Keaton), it becomes a little troublesome for the film's direction and tonal structure. It never becomes a distraction for the most part, but it comes off at times like Pixar is trying to cram too much into the film. I understand it is the last hurrah and the film that brings closure to this legendary series, but there could have been significantly more focus in some scenes. I have heard complaints about the nightmarish direction parts of the film takes, but this easily would not have been a problem had not begun weaving around in sections.But any problems the film has are forgiven by one of the most beautiful and bittersweet endings ever put to the format. It is so emotionally charged and so wonderful that you instantly forget anything you had against the film. If we had to suffer through some less than great scenes, they are all made up for in the ending. It speaks volumes for the franchise, and is almost heartbreaking to watch. I want to say more, but I fear for spoiling it for anyone who has yet to see the film. It is hard to not forge an emotional response to the finale, and you may need to sit through the wildly entertaining credits to regain your composure afterwards.As with every Pixar film, the voice acting and animation are incredible across the board. Listening to the likes of Hanks and Allen chatting again is like being in a room with old friends you have not seen in awhile, but have not changed at all since. New additions like Beatty, Keaton, Jeff Garlin and especially Timothy Dalton are all excellent as well. The animation is so precise and detailed to a level of perfection that only Pixar can give. The years away have only made these characters look even better than they ever have, and has given the backgrounds and human characters an even greater depth of realism. Not once does Pixar skimp on any detail in any instance.It is not the perfect picture on the whole that I wanted it to be, but Toy Story 3 is a great finale to the series and another great entry in the Pixar canon. What disappointment there is is immediately taken away by a touchingly beautiful finale. This is not Pixar at its finest hour, but it only further cements their status as the best studio in the business of animation, and film-making in general.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
an enjoyable third installment,"After an eleven-year absence, those lovable toys return for more in this latest sequel from Pixar. Woody, Buzz, et al have their greatest fears realized when their beloved owner Andy—now grown-up—prepares to depart for college. Facing new obstacles and adversaries after being taken to a day-care center, it's a race against time for the toys as they try desperately to escape and keep their tight-knit group together. Considering the length of time it took for the project to come together some rust was bound to show, but as always there are a talented cast of voices, remarkable animation, genuine humor, and some truly poignant moments. Slow at first but only gets better as it goes along, building up to an emotional and heartwarming finale. Not quite as compelling as its predecessors but still very entertaining, though not surprisingly the three-dimensional effects don't add much to the proceedings. ***",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Good but not great,"I wouldn't agree with many of the reviews when they say this is the best in the series. The first in the series is by far the best and will always be a classic.While the film is pretty good it will never beat the first time you meet the main characters and there lies the problem. The new characters are mostly secondary to the ones we already know so it is business as usual as far as I am concerned.I think most people reviewing this film forgot how good #1 was when they first watched it and hence saying it is the best one.However saying all that, this is a good film and worth seeing as long as you don't expect too much from it. The story is basic but the characters are still funny enough to make it worthwhile.A good ending to a great series.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
It was like it was almost about me!,"Toy Story 3 is an amazing movie. It goes farther than just a movie about toys, but the emotions in the generation that grew up with Andy and the toys. I am Class of 2010 and I'm now myself headed to college once the summer is up. I almost cried at the end. I didn't think it would be so, but I really do believe this movie tops the previous two, and they are great movies in there own right. Besides all of that, the movie itself was vintage Pixar full of great clean laughs and an entertaining plot. I think the movie would be more enjoyed by my generation that grew up with it from the mid 90's up to now, and others can enjoy it as well. Bravo once again Pixar.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Plot Hole: The Movie starring Toy Story 2's Plot,"Toy Story 3 follows Andy's toys as he moves to college and attempts to donate them, whereupon they decide to escape from the day care in which they were sent to.Similar to the last two movies, the voice acting is great. Every actor has hit just the right amount of expression and tone for each line in each scenario. It's clear that these guys are competent and know exactly what they're doing at this point.In addition, the music continues to be good. It's a well-suited soundtrack for the series, and that trend doesn't stop here.However, this movie is littered with plot holes. Most of the movie is consumed by the toys' attempt to escape the day care. Their plan is intricate and well-thought out, yet so little of it makes sense. So much of it is reliant on certain items being in certain areas when, in reality those items are fairly unlikely to be there. And the characters would've had zero opportunity to actually seek out these items due to their situation in the day care. I found myself sighing and cringing far too often as their plan was carried out, and it just proved unenjoyable to say the least.Furthermore, I don't see how people can love this movie more than Toy Story 2, because both movies are practically identical. If you don't see it, let me break a couple things down for you. Both are about the toys trying to escape from their current predicament to return to Andy, both movies feature a large, lovable character with a cane who is later proved to be less than what he was originally thought to be, both feature sob stories (complete with flashbacks) for new characters, both involve a scene near the end where the characters are on a conveyor belt of some kind. Connecting the dots yet? Yeah, they're the same movie, just with different looking characters. And there's even more similarities than that if you watch the movie, which I won't spoil for you if you haven't seen it.Overall Toy Story 3 is nonsensical, often rushed, and completely recycled material. I really don't understand how it got as much acclaim as it did, but that's beyond my control I suppose. In the end I wouldn't recommend this movie.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Excellent!!,"At first seeing the previews of yet another toy story i thought Disney and Pixar was just trying to make another movie to bank on a good series, but i was soo wrong. I've scene the film 3 times now and still the movie makes me laugh and brings me nearly to tears at the same time. The way the plot lays out beautifully, and the characters (new and old) still manage to be lovable. I would recommend seeing this film with someone you care about so you ca appreciate it's awesomeness together. I'm almost positive you'll agree with me. Oh, and I would also try to get anyone who hasn't seen the first 2 films to watch them first, because it will ruin a some of the plots of either of the movies before you even see them.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Toy Story 3 (spoilers),"Toy Story 3 – Firstly to begin with the animation in this film was the best yet, Pixar have done it yet again. It never ceases to amaze me the realistic animation that is available these days. Now the storyline was about Andy going away to college and deciding what to do with his old toys (Woody, Buzz e.t.c), he decides to put them in the attic. Then accidentally he leaves the bag of toys on the floor. His mum then picks them up thinking that they are trash. They somehow manage to get out of the bag and they end up in a box off to Sunnyside daycare centre. At first the toys think this is great and they are in a safe place. Woody is the only one to say that he believes that Andy didn't want to get rid of them and only wanted them in the attic. By the way Woody had been chosen by Andy to go to college. So then the toys try to escape from Sunnyside, in turn trying to get back to Andy. That is the basic plot. Now this is a great film for say age 3 and up, basically for the whole family. You will love the animation. The characters will capture and break your heart again, and it's just so much damn fun. I loved this film, it bought me back to my childhood, and reminded me how much I loved movies, and when I loved to play with my toys. I give this film 5 out of 5 stars. I already strongly recommend the academy to consider it for best picture at the Oscars in February 2011.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

An all round winner !!,"Toy Story 3 opens in a similar vein to the previous film, but this time Woody (Tom Hanks) is the hero of the imaginary adventure. Watch the three films back to back and you'll see the progression in the quality of the animation. In this film the people are still stylized, but the level of detail and expression is far beyond what was in the previous film; it's really beautiful and helps you connect to the human characters more than ever. Having said that, I did see it in 3D and frankly the film would have been just as good without it.As with everything Pixar does, the attention to detail here is incredible. How the slide in the playground becomes a watchtower at night. How marker smudges become prison stats. The level of detail, in things like Woody's rounded-down hairline, is astounding. And yes, that's the voice of John Morris, now 23, playing Andy once again. Why get the same actor when only a few might notice? Because everything is everything here.And talking about the emotional part of the film; it starts tugging at you a little bit early on, then gives way for a lot of the fun stuff. If you don't shed a tear at some point you might just be made of stone. There's just one scene after another, going from touching, to heartbreaking, back to touching and melancholy. There are few live action films that can reach your heart the way this one did in the last 15 minutes or so. And the jail-break sequence was so exciting, you forget that you are watching an animated movie and get totally involved with the characters.The relationship that the toys have with their owners in the Toy Story-movies has always been a curious thing. In order for toys to truly feel wanted, their owners need to really use their imaginations while playing with them. There almost needs to be a heightened sense of wonder involved in order for the toys to feel complete. This is what drives them to find a place where the kids would connect to them and enjoy playing with them. Thats when all hell breaks loose and everything seems to go wrong. You can't help but notice the small values of life that these toys teach us in almost every juncture. No matter what we have around us, be it living or not, its special. Its special 'cause it serves a purpose that no one else can !Go see Toy Story 3 and take the whole family. It might just end up being your all time favorite Pixar film. The three movies have now shown us that the story of a toy is, overall, a sad one. But not one without pride. And not one without joy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Toy Story 3 (2010, G)","""Toy Story 3"" has plenty of action, adventure, and fun once it gets going, but even better is the overall effect of nostalgia for the viewer. Comedy films like to make fun of these types of childhood experiences, and no doubt they do have a comical side especially through the perspective of adults; for example, Rick Moranis is memorable playing with action figure dolls in a scene in ""Spaceballs"". ""Toy Story 3"" gives playtime scenarios a positive and tear-jerking spin with high hopes of lifting them from comedy into important individual and educational experiences. However, the catch is that most of the movie is a parallel adventure played out by the toys themselves. Having the toys come to life is not quite as annoying as in other films. It actually makes sense from the perspective of a hypothetical game scenario that a kid would likely make up.Andy, 17 years old now, is past playing such games and leaves his toys untouched in a toy box. He keeps the box around at his age mainly for the requirements of the plot, and we can imagine the writers had a difficult time figuring out how to begin the third of these ""Toy Story"" movies. They start with an flashback to Andy's toys in full lifelike visual effects, which seems right out of a segment for a modern video game. Andy lets some of the toy characters behave based on their inherent persona's, but some of them he creates himself, such as giving a piggy bank, Hamm (John Ratzenberger), an evil nature as the ultimate bad guy of his stories. Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), and associates are the main good guys.But these are short lived events as we flash forward to Andy's grown up concerns about college. His toys quickly downgrade from a hope to play with him again to a hope that he will store them in the attic rather throw them in the trash. Is this a slight metaphor for keeping the fruits of our childhood visions alive? Well, the toys see their role as servants to any future need Andy might have for them, but an attic isn't very entertaining, so the toys get sent to Sunnyside daycare in the hopes they may be of interest to a new generation of kids. They won't. The toys get sent to a play room for toddlers, who have no imagination and only bang the toys into things and rip them apart. The kids might as well have a bunch of rocks to roll around since they certainly aren't getting any benefit out of elaborately designed toys.Woody (Tom Hanks) tries to convince the rest of Andy's toys to break out of the place and to live in peace in Andy's attic, but they are skeptical. They think Andy was about to throw them in the trash and they want new kids to play with them. Woody escapes by himself, but a young girl, Bonnie, finds him and takes him to her house. Woody enjoys his games with her, but her toys (including a theater porcupine, Mr. Pricklepants, who shushes the other toys so he can stay in character) inform him that Sunnyside isn't sunny and his friends are in trouble. A big purple and strawberry smelling bear, named ""Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear"" or ""Lotso"" (Ned Beatty), who rides in the back of a toy truck and walks with a cane like Yoda, is actually a menacing warden over Sunnyside daycare. He loves to give hugs, but he also likes to send the newbies (toys, that is) to the toddler playroom (named Caterpillar Room) and keep them prisoner at night so they won't try to escape. He creates an oligarchy of toys in which his elderly elite get to play with the older kids (in the Butterfly Room), who actually use them as intended and imagine them in more sophisticated games.The escape sequences are the most adventuresome and funny parts of the movie. Lotso marshals his forces to keep the new toys in line. His long time enforcer is Big Baby, but he also has Ken (Michael Keaton), an octopus (Whoopi Goldberg), and roving trucks on his side. His newest addition is Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), who he reboots to a default military mode (stripping him of his former identity) by reading his instructional manual. At one point Buzz gets reset into Spanish mode, turning into a romantic. Ken entertains Barbie by modeling clothes. He has a soft spot for clothing as much as she does, perhaps from participating in so many games imagined by girls. Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) and Mrs. Potato Head (Estelle Harris) have parts similar to a Transformer or certain Vampires – ears, eyes, and mouths function perfectly while detached. Mrs. Potato Head sees over long distances to her lost eye, and Mr. Potato Head attaches his parts to pita bread. Are their parts therefore nearly immortal?It expands from this arch of a playful adventure to make a point about the value of play. It's a film about nostalgia for a boy's past experiences playing with toys as a sort of simulation or self-training for life. It might be a tear-jerker for many viewers, perhaps mostly adults, because many will relate to its message. The message is perhaps that Andy had a great deal to do with raising himself, but not entirely on his own. He also had the help of toys to manipulate and use as little pegs for his memories. These toys develop their own back story for him, some of which is inherent in the toys' characters but some of which is quite unique and invented by him. In this sense, his toys are external memories, storing a mini world of his past imaginings and mental experiments. It's important to him to pass these memories along.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Three for Three!,"Sequels by definition mean very different things to very different people. Sequels are met with sighs, gasps, cheers, dollar signs and more than often ""wtf?"" This is because sequels notoriously never quite (or at all) live up to their originals, it is a sad fact that some of your favourite films have more than likely be ruined by inferior siblings. Films such as Speed 2: Cruise Control and Ocean's Twelve spring to mind as two films that we could all do without ever seeing and no doubt omitted from numerous stars résumés. The secret lies in recreating the magic that made the 1st film such a hit and for many directors, writers and studios it is something they all too frequently fail to achieve. There are exceptions to the rules, as ever, and every so often sequels manage to muster together enough cinema gold and give birth to a sequel that is on par with its older sibling and on that rare special occasion a sequel that I dare say is better than its predecessor. Films such Terminator 2: Judgement Day, Aliens, Clerks 2 and X2, have all shown that sequels can be just as good or even better than their originals. Further down the line the dreaded threequel and numerous non-direct sequels plague the video-store shelves covered in dust and outlandish quotes engraved on the cover claiming to be ""better than the original"" or ""if you loved Mega Piranha, you are going to love this"". They are an inevitable evil in this world that tarnish the name of its forbearer that we must live with, Shrek The Third, Spider-Man 3, Stars Wars: The Phantom (JarJarYouAlmostRuinedStarWarsBinks) Menace, The Godfather 3, Alien Resurrection etc, a horrible list that goes on and on. Which brings me somewhat fittingly to the matter of Toy Story 3, a sequel, a threequel , so is it any good? Rather simply no, to call Toy Story 3 simply good would be both an insult to Pixar and every 20-something who 1st watched Toy Story 15 year ago because Story isn't good it's brilliant.11 days is a fairly long time, 11 months is almost a year and 11 years seems like a eternity for some but that's how long it has been since Toy Story 2 graced our silver screens. In those 11 years gone Pixar have released no fewer than 7 films, in which we have seen superheroes, cars, monsters, rats, a flying house, fish and a very special robot light up our picture houses but not since 1999 have we seen the return of Toys until now. Initially my reaction was ""oh no, they are going to ruin Toy Story"" but then I reassured myself with the notion that this is a Pixar film after all, and while I will admit that I am not a huge fan of Cars, Pixar are pretty much 10 for 10. Furthermore we only have to look at Toy Story 2 and see that lightning can strike twice in the same place, and if anyone was going to make lightning strike for a 3rd time it would be Pixar.What you have to admire immediately about Toy Story 3 is just how accessible it is to both devoted followers now in their twenties and the new generation of booster seat lovers. Moreover how the parents are the ones that are dragging their kids and not vice versa, as trust me I think I can safely say that I will not lose any sleep over missing Shrek The Incontinent come its premiere in 2022. Toy Story 3 picks up with the gang minus a few members in the same bedroom that we met them in 15 years ago but now resigned to the toy chest. Andy is all grown up and off to college soon, the bedroom we once knew is now a distant memory and now that of a teenage boy. During the clear out of his room ,Andy comes upon the toys he adored so much as a child and is met with a difficult decision of what should become of the toys, attic or rubbish? But of course things don't go to plan and the toys wind up at a day-care and in true Toy Story fashion it is up to Woody to convince the gang that they don't belong there and need to return to Andy before he heads off to college.While the story may feel familiar, as you may remember in Toy Story 2 the gang were trying to make their way back to Andy after Woody was mistakenly picked up at a garage sale, it doesn't feel old or rehashed one bit. Written by Pixar genius John Lasseter and Wall-E director Andrew Stanton, the series regulars appear to be both new and refreshing while instantly familiar as if they had never left us all. Woody is still loyal as ever to Andy despite being neglected for some time now, Mr and Mrs Potato Head still fighting like a newlywed couple, Hamm sarcastic as ever and Jessie still showing signs of a underlining fear of neglect. In which lies Toy Story's emotional core, the themes of friendship, loss and moving on. Whether we like to admit it or not we don't like change, we get used to things the way they are and when that changes, it's sometimes hard to admit that a change has occurred. Woody has always had a issue with change, ever since Buzz turned up on Andy's bed and that fear of change still carries weight throughout Toy Story 3 as Woody tries to convince himself and the group that they need to get back to Andy*** Head over to www.dvdisdead.co.uk to read the rest of the review ***",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
An Amazing Trilogy,"Any sequel reflects the original and while I adore A New Hope over any of the other Star Wars, or Back to the Future part 1, or Godfather (obviously), I fell in love with Toy Story 3. I thought the first two were unbeatable but I stand corrected. Toy Story 3 packed such a punch, I laughed, I (almost!) cried, and I feel like I should break out my old toys and play with them for ol time's sake. The opening scene (hilarious) and the climax (Ahhh!) are what sold me. The story and writing alone is amazing; add the graphics and it is phenomenal. I am not the hugest fan of CG or 3D over the old school but you can't help but wander how long it takes to design hair or fur to wave like that in the breeze. Earlier complains have been that it is perhaps not best for small children. There are some innuendos and dark moments but Disney has always pushed the envelope on dark moments (e.g. Mufasa, Black Cauldron, Up's beginning heartbreaking montage) Will Disney/Pixar ever stop playing with my emotions??

"If you saw 1, and 2 as a kid, this movie was MADE for you.","Last night (technically, this morning) at 12:01 am, I was sitting next to my friends. We were all eager to see what was waiting for us. Pixar had our childhood in their hands, would they be able to deliver? Even though Pixar has never disappointed me, I still had some worries deep down in my heart.....All of those worries were blown away by the first scene. If you were into Toy Story and could remember certain lines, you could catch a lot of references in that first scene alone.As the story progressed, I quickly realized how much more emotional and darker it was then the other films...... it was something that I would not have understood as much if I watched as a kid..... I checked spoiler free, so I can not go into detail about this, but after seeing the film, you will have the same feeling I did.That being said, even with the dark, emotional times, there was a lot of laughs. The jokes were hilarious, I was laughing from start to finish! By the time the ending credits rolled along, I got up on my feet, and clapped. I was joined by the entire theater. We were all thinking the same thing. This movie delivered. If I could rate this an 11, I would, believe me I would. Somehow, it surpassed the first film. It is Pixars greatest triumph. It is better then any animated movie made. Hell, it even jumped straight to #1 on my list of favorite movies in general! This movie was simply perfect. Crisp animation. Great laughs. Perfect Pathos. I was on the verge of tearing up at points of it, sometimes out of laughter, sometimes, out of sadness.I KNOW that the people that are going to down rank this movie are going to do so on the fact that this movie are going to do so because of the emotional ride this film was, maybe not something kids would quite grasp..... but for people like me, who grew up with this film, this was perfect.11/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A funny and zany children's screwball comedy...but not one of Pixar's best,"First things first, this is a film obviously aimed at children ages 3-10, so I am not exactly the target audience for this. That being said, if I was a kid in that age range I would have a blast at this movie, as it is great fun for the very young, undeveloped mind. However, as an adult reviewer I give this film a mixed review overall, for it does some things well, yet fails in other aspects.Overall, the film is quite a bit of fun, with plenty of gags and silly comedic moments. If escapism and comedy is all you are looking for in a summer film, then this film will serve you just fine. It is an entertaining summer film, so I would recommend it on that level alone. However, let's look at some of this flaws, which certainly don't make it deserving of a 9 or 10.Flaw 1 - lack of heart or character growth. Unlike Pixar's 3 masterpieces, UP, Wall-E and Nemo, this film just lacks any kind of emotion, wonder, or heart. It feels more like an Ice Age film that is simply focused on comedy and action, but feels very hollow emotionally. It feels like the team at Pixar was just going through the motions of churning out another cutesy film, without trying very hard to make it a good one. It is true that the last 5 minutes have some heart, but the 85 minutes before that don't have much at all. Certainly far less than what we would expect in a Pixar film.Flaw 2 - the 2nd half of the film really drags. After about 30-35 minutes into the film, the script suddenly becomes cliché-ridden as the toys get captured and have to be rescued/escape back home. Literally nothing interesting or mentally engaging happens in the 2nd half, other than the toys trying to escape, with a few gags thrown in. This becomes tedious after a while, so the film feels about 15 minutes longer than necessary.Pros - Top notch animation, some funny gags, Latso the Bear character, and a great opening scene Cons - Story is too simple and drags during the 2nd half, too many Ken/ Barbie scenes becomes repetitive.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A tad bit overrated...,"I watched Toy Story 3 on the night it came out. I thought it was a really good movie. What I didn't expect is for it to take #6 in the Top 250 (as of 7-15-10). It really doesn't deserve that. I am also greatly disappointed that it even passed up Toy Story (1), it was not better than the first. The movie is just getting a hype from reviewers that quickly go towards that 10 star rating immediately because of the fact that it wasn't a bad movie.On a lighter note, I thought it was a great movie. Great animation, dialogue, decent plot, it's just a decent movie overall. Shouldn't be in the Top 10 and absolutely shouldn't be in the Top 5.I'm not bashing Pixar or the makers of Toy Story, I'm simply just mad that an average movie is taking out all the other movies on the Top 250 when they actually do deserve the position they had before.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Wonderful third Toy Story,"I love this movie so much. It is an excellent third Toy Story movie. Although Andy (Andrew) Davis is going to college because he did very well in high school. I think Andy (Andrew) Davis is a straight A student in the general level courses. I wonder what kind of career that requires college education? Maybe he might be a professional soccer or baseball player for the major league. Well that is hard to explain because I do not know yet. Buzz Lightyear is one of my favourite Toy Story characters because he is futuristic, a space ranger; maybe he can be one for law enforcement as well. Even though if there is going to be a Toy Story 4, I do not know yet if there is going to be a Toy Story 4. Maybe Toy Story 3 is the final Toy Story movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A wild emotional journey through the perfect ending of the best animation trilogy ever made,"I must start this review by saying a few things about the Toy Story franchise. When I was a kid I didn't saw Toy Story in '95 nor the sequel in '99. I remember I saw Toy Story in 2003 and I thought it was okay. Now with all the surrounding hype of the third installment I decided to go through the first 2 movies before I'll watch Toy Story 3 so few days ago I saw them and I was amazed what I lost when I was at a very young age. The first 2 parts are amazing, the first deserving an honestly 8,9 and the second a better 9,1, but because of the hype of Toy Story 3 I was a little bit skeptic about how good it would be. Today I saw it and it was awesome! Not only awesome but I think one of the top animations ever made.The story is perfect because it has real funny standout moments, it has no major flaws, it has action sequences which are executed by the finest hands from Pixar Studios. Besides that it has a great way of developing the characters and providing the necessary amount of suspense or thrill at times. Along the movie you feel happy, sad, scared, terrified, amazed, ""WOWed"" and more than anything entertained. All that not only because of the great comeback of the toys but also because of the incredible soundtrack provided by the talented Randy Newman.Toy Story 3 ain't just an animation movie, it's more than that. Adults and children could be entertained at the same time. Who doesn't remember how much passion and how much we loved our toys when we were kids? Who doesn't remember how it's to feel something for a bunch of plastic things? But the strongest part in the movie isn't the beginning with the great introduction, nor the action sequences but the ending which was this close to make my tears drop down. I had a feeling that I remember I got when I was a kid and I watched ""Lion King"" which was a great emotional journey. Toy Story it's the same having by far one of the greatest endings animation movies have ever seen and I'm sure that if I saw Toy Story as a kid I would definitely could not have controlled myself today.As far as a franchise Toy Story is by far the best animation trilogy. Talking about technical aspects I would say that the sound editing was top notch, integrating very well the score, audio effects and dialogue into the movie. Cinematography was good but had some times were it could have been better. The 3D was rendered perfect in my theater so I had nothing against it though there were not so many actual stunning 3D effects.In the end I don't know, go see the movie and see for yourself how good this is. Till now it's the best movie out this year and I think the next one that could top it might be Inception.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Complete satisfaction,"Toy Story 3 is an adventure filled, entertaining and deeply emotional film for all ages.Toy Story was the beginning of PIXAR's extraordinary journey and they have delivered with just about every film since. The only question in my mind before seeing this film was ""Will it live up to the lofty standards of the first two films?"". Toy Story and Toy Story 2 were great in their own right but this film outclassed them both.The start was subtle, we see Andy playing with his toys as usual but something has changed. Then we embark on a journey with all the toys, again as usual. At this point the movie was only good but in the second half it just takes off. Can't say more without spoiling it. It has to be experienced. And the best part comes last, the ending of this movie gave me utmost satisfaction. What an end to the best trilogy of all time (atleast in my opinion) and Toy Story will remain the best trilogy unless Batman 3 proves otherwise.This film will made me laugh, jump with excitement and cry...thats right, the last 5-7 minutes were so moving that I shed a few tears. If you are wondering how can adults cry over toys, go see this.The wizards at PIXAR have delivered a masterpiece once again. The bar cannot be raised higher.Toy Story 3 is now officially my favourite animated feature film along with 'Spirited Away'.P.S. Kudos to PIXAR for 'Day & Night'(short film screened before Toy Story 3), it was simple yet amazing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
excellent conclusion to the greatest trilogy ever!!!,"Whether your a toddler, a child, a teenager, or an adult, you will love this film, especially if you love Pixar, which is about everybody out there. Every Pixar movie, with the exception of Cars, is terrific, but the best is Toy Story. Toy Story 2 was also great, but then this came and perfectly concluded the trilogy, surpassing Toy Story 2. Pixar's first trilogy, and the greatest trilogy ever!Also the funniest Pixar film, even though its not as good as the first, but just by a tiny bit. It has comedy, action, and tons of emotion. Has a really clever plot, which borrows from The Great Escape a little bit.Andy is heading out to college, leaving the toys in depression. They get donated to a Daycare center which looks like a toy paradise, but turns out to be a prison led by a pink bear named Lotso where new toys are played with by roudy toddlers that play with them like rag dolls, in which they plot to escape.The fact that the first was the first movie I've ever seen is the only reason I like it better, but this film is not only funnier, but is a lot more epic, of course thats because its the last one, with the most emotional ending in Pixar. You will cry watching this film if you are a fan of Pixar, guaranteed. I don't just love the ending, but I can't help but think back at the other ones. Its emotional not just for the movie, but it even reminds me of when I had to give something up that I really liked in my childhood, such as my Rescue Heroes, or my Dragon Ball Z action figures, or even some Toy Story toys that I had of my own. No matter what you think, never feel the movie's plot is fading throughout, cause in the end it will all be resolved.You will be stunned by how good this film is. It was 10x better than what I expected. Without a doubt the second best Pixar film, and also one of my top ten favorite films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A movie for the ages,"32 years ago I watched my first movie. It was Star Wars Episode IV. Today, my 3-years old son watched his first movie in the big screen. Only to keep with the family tradition, Toy Story 3 is going to run the same fate as one of the greatest movies ever. This is a spectacular movie, inspiring, moving and hilarious all at the same time. It touched me, made me cry and made me think about what's really important in life. I usually don't care much about technical variables. e.g. the animation itself. But in this case the plot and the animation are so brilliantly delivered that it's hard to imagine one without the other. There is one scene in particular (and don't worry I won't tell you which) that will pass the test of time as one of the greatest moment of this beautiful form of art.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
What a perfect way to end the story!,"I honestly don't like giving perfect scores, but that's how I exactly felt about this movie. The Pixar crew did exactly what I expected, a fantastic screenplay, & a vivid adventurous story that could finally conclude with a happy ending (please, no Toy Story 4). I don't want to discuss the film in detail, it's very much worth watching it for yourself. You'll experience happiness with the whole gang, you'll feel sorry for them & you'll probably tear like I did, it's a fantastic sequel. This film clearly tells me we can all rely on Pixar to enter their original films a second time, a wonderful world they've created, whether if in the monster world, or the superhero world. You'll definitely enjoy this beautiful ending from the first world we've experienced back in 1995!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A great adventure for everyone!,"This film is about the toys fighting for survival when their owner Andy is about to go off to college.""Toy Story 3"" is a belated and much welcomed sequel to ""Toy Story 2"". Animation is great, and every character, even the evil ones, are so cute and cuddly that makes you want to go to a toy store and buy them.The plot is amazing too, as it has got something to engage people in every age group. The plot is an heroic adventure for children; a tale to celebrate friendship and loyalty for adults; and makes older viewers reflect on their childhood days. Another winning aspect of the plot is that it fully utilises the basic human need of being loved. A plot cannot be better than that! ""Toy Story 3"" makes you laugh and then cry with the characters. It is a great adventure for everyone.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
It's definitely worth your time and money,"Well, I've seen that most of the criticism towards this film is that it might be too scary for young children. This of course are made by people who see these children as the movie's target audience. WELL, IT'S NOT! Toy story one came out in 1995 and it was marketed for young children (ages 4 or 5 to 12 I would say), and this movie, released 15 years later, I think it tries to appeal the same audiences that grew up with the original Toy Story. I saw it today, and most of the people at the cinema were in their 20s and over. -yes there were some children.Anyway, beside this, the movie is worth it... I don't think the 3D was necessary, except for a few scenes, but it kept me very entertained the whole time... I got very emotional by the end (someone a little more sensitive than I might cry) and there are some very lovable new characters. Yes, the bad guy is REALLY bad, there's not even the slightest hint of humanity in him... in that way I think this is kind of a western movie, with a truly unselfish and extremely brave hero and a terribly mean bad guy, it's a little square in that sense but the context makes up for it.Good job Disney/Pixar",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
one of my favorite movies of all time,"The best magic tricks in the world are ones that cannot be unraveled, reverse engineered or dissected to figure out exactly how they are pulled off. This philosophy is doubly applicable to Pixar's ""Toy Story 3"", the storyline-ending outré of the beloved Toy Story, uh, story.I feel it relevant somehow to divulge my age, as it somehow validates the powerful emotions evoked throughout the film. I am a 28 year old male, who, fifteen years ago, was fresh into the teen years of supposed adolescence at the release of some weird, 3d animated movie (wait, they can animate with computers?) entitled ""Toy Story"". This was a pretty bold move, a calculated stroll to the edge of the cliff and a daring leap off into the thin air of creativity and innovation. And it was a hit, ensuring 3d animation a place right alongside (more or less) 2d animation. And naturally, Pixar would be at the forefront, leading the cavalry charge of digital animation ranging from great to gad-awful.""Toy Story 3"" starts off as comfortably as possible, with our friends Woody and Buzz Lightyear doing what they do the best...playing with Andy in his world of make-believe adventure. We are then treated to some familiar Pixar progression, like abandonment, solidarity, coming back to friends, and the passing of the torch. Clearly, in the eleven years between this point and when ""Toy Story 2"" wrapped, a computer revolution or four has occurred, allowing a world of unsurpassed clarity, reality and imagination to shine through like never before. TS1's spark is TS2's candle, and that in turn is TS3's blazing sun.Roll the last fifteen minutes of film. It became clearly obvious that the figurative tables have been turned, because a good number of the adults in the audience (including myself) were sniffling and teary-eyed, while the kids were looking up, likely thinking ""jeez mom and dad, they're just toys, get over it"".Wasn't it conventional wisdom that just the kids get emotional over losing plastic playthings? With ""Toy Story 3"", Pixar has shown us one of the greatest magic tricks in modern showbiz history, likely not to be outdone or duplicated, that we all have very real and deep connections to our childhoods and to the things and people that allowed us as kids to be free, and innocent, and pure, and most importantly, to dream. This, to me, is a life lesson worth remembering, to infinity and beyond.""Toy Story 3"" gets 10 of 10 blazing stars",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Dark, different, but still fun","As entertaining and fun as it was, I liked Toy Story 3 less than its predecessors. It simply lacked the sweetly poetic and soulful touch that made the first two instant classics.The artwork, animation, music, and voice acting are all superb, as we've come to expect. Toy Story 3 is much darker, even downright creepy at times, a welcome change from the first two. Like Up, Toy Story 3 does not adhere as tightly to a central theme as prior Pixar movies. However, unlike my experience with Up, I did not come away inspired and moved by the adventure and the characters. Instead, the movie felt like it bounced all over, sampling from themes already explored in Toy Story 1 and 2, nibbling on a few new ideas, but never really delving too deeply in any one direction.My bigger issue is that Toy Story 3 relies more heavily on visual slapstick, referential gags, and audience familiarity with the first two movies. In short, it feels much more like a Dreamworks movie. True, Dreamworks movies are fun, but Pixar has always made superior films by sticking to bold and fresh characterization, clever jokes, and sincere, masterfully woven messages.But the end result is still a 7 out of 10. Even when stumbling, Pixar still makes very good movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
As Andy grows up so does the Toy Story franchise.,"What troubled me the most about this film was it felt like it was the same story (Andy leaves the room, Toys get lost or in trouble, Toys need to work together to get home, Antagonist makes life tough for Toys, etc), but as the film unravels you remember the real reason you are here. To see Pixar animation come to life, beautifully I might add, and to be entertained for an hour and a half. All our returning friends are back, minus a few, but now Andy is 17 and moving onto college and the fates of the Toys are sealed. The characters who are gone are replaced by some new and exciting characters. The film also opens up with a new adventure in the beginning that is exciting too. This part was never done in the other two films either and gave a new dimension to this film. It obviously is an adventure that is generated by the ideas found in Andy's head but the Pixar team gives it to you like it was totally real. The interesting thing about the story is the parallel lines between Andy's situation and the mood the film will eventually take that catapults it into being one of the best films of this summer. As Andy grows up so does the Toy Story franchise. This film takes a startling, but welcoming turn towards the mature side of things and dishes out a dark side and a violent side that tells us that the Toy Story world has grown up. I don't want to say what happens, but it is jarring. Some highlights are Potato Head as a tortilla shell, Barbie & Ken, Michael Keaton expertly handling the voice of Ken and an homage to the now classic theme song ""You Got a Friend in Me"" in Spanish. In my opinion it still isn't as good as the original, but damn close. It is a fond farewell (hopefully not the last).",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Simply Outstanding and Great Entertainment,"I've watched the first two Toy Story movies many many times.I had few expectations when my 17 year-old daughter asked if we could take the whole family to go see Toy Story 3 for her 17th birthday.This would be my first 3D movie in a theater and that is my only complaint about the film. I don't think 3D added much to the movie. I moved my glasses up a number of times and scenes where the characters were close were in focus and so much clearer and brighter. I would like to see it again in 2D.In Toy Story 3 Andy is 17 and getting ready to go to college so he is packing everything up including all the old familiar toys. He finally decides to store all the toys in the attic except for Woody which he puts in a box marked ""College"". This then is the premise of the story: Woody doesn't want to leave his friends; but they are not happy with the idea of being put in an attic and not being played with.Through a very clever set of events they all end up at a day care center which turns out to be a living hell for newly arrived toys. A hell which they want to escape as they realize the importance of their loyalty to Andy which Woody helped them to understand.There are some very dark scenes at the day care center and for those that grew up with the previous installments it's OK, but I don't think very young children will have an easy time with it and that also holds true for much of the dialog.Also, while it would be very helpful to have see either Toy Story or Toy Story 2 or both, Toy Story 3 could stand on its own and could be very much appreciated by someone who hasn't seen the previous two.There are some truly funny scenes; for me the Spanish Buzz Lightyear was just hilarious! Mr and Mrs Potato Head had relatively large roles and were great. I'm happy to say I was quite impressed with Don Rickles contribution.The main reason I felt compelled to write a review is that as a 55 year old man the last thing I expected to happen was that I cried towards the end of the film. Toy Story 3 is a masterpiece in storytelling and 3D animation, but also it reaches emotional depths.I saw this today in a packed Taiwanese theater of mostly Taiwanese adults who had to rely on subtitles and there was every evidence that they were enjoying it as much as I was.I am very much looking forward to seeing it again.

"Buzz, Woody and the gang back in action, this time facing their biggest decision yet.","I am a 46 year old dad that loves Pixar's animated movies. My wait to see TS3 has been giving me anxiety for over a year in a good sense. My family and I saw the movie last Sunday with very high expectations. Off course the wait paid off and in a big way. This movie provides the audience with all kinds of assortments, superb technical details, laughs left and right, surprise plot twists and a heavy dose of nostalgia, my beloved wife was sniffling as usual. The folks from Pixar are gifted people who for over 15 years have managed to pull off what the audience like to see. Their products all have been hits because their dedication to every detail and commitment to quality has made them a big name in the industry. TS3 could easily be considered the best in the trilogy, just like Star Wars III did in year 2005. Simply it is flawless, the studios have perfected an already outstanding theme. What I like the most of TS3 is that the story although a bit predictable, still knows how to pull the right strings into making an engaging movie packed with emotion that can compare to real life experiences as well. I am no movie expert nor critic, but for me this flick shall be awarded all the Oscar's it can be nominated for and not just best animated movie category, but best motion picture of the year 2010.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Toy Story 3: Best Movie of Them All,"When I saw Toy Sotry 3 last week I was astonished! I thought that it would be one of those movies where the first movie was great and would sink to the ground in a matter of time. Not with Toy Story 3! Ever since the beginning I was a fan of Toy Story. The characters in this movie were lively as ever.Tom Hanks and Tim Allen did it again with their excellent chemistry as Woddy and Buzz. Of course Pixar increased the quality of the characters making them look more surreal. The movie would've been better if Jim Varney was around but I know he died in 2005 and got replaced.If you're a Toy Story fan like me, go see it!

Amazing characters, direction, writing, animation, everything. It is the rare film that crosses over and is enjoyed by everyone involved. I have really nothing else to say because it has been praised as much as it can be already. Oh, and that ending! Wow, that ending- this marks the 2nd time I have ever cried in the ending of a film, and I am not a cryer at all.

Pixar holds nothing back in this final installment of our childhood movie.,"I've had a streak with mediocre and fairly entertaining movies this summer and thankfully Toy Story 3 ended it. This movie had the laughs, the thrills, and at the end of it all you'll be struggling to keep yourself from shedding tears. I don't care if I make it sound overrated or hyped up but what I saw was what I saw: A sequel that lives up to the franchise and so much more.The voice acting is lively and even for a sequel that is darker compared to its predecessors, the vibrant new characters fill up the screen wonderfully. No longer did I think about Tom Hanks and Tim Allen and co. I was seeing Woody and Buzz and the gang playing out their parts, they all do a great job bringing our beloved friends to life.I have to be honest, I didn't get teary-eyed by the movie's end but my heart just melted with the emotions.

"Wow, not nearly as good as the first two.","OK, so I of course loved the first two films, loved Avatar in 3D, had seen the trailers (including in 3D during the World Cup which looked awesome), and had high hopes for this film. We saw it this morning in Real-D 3D.First of all the 3D added very little to the presentation, so if you aren't specifically a fan of 3D then don't bother as you'll not be missing anything. I had to actually exert some effort to notice the 3D much of the time which was odd. It felt like there just wasn't enough information being presented by the 3D effect, even less so than other films including other animated ones.But anyhow, what about the movie? Well 7/10 is all I can give it. Yes, it's a Pixar film, so you know it's going to be well produced. But quite a number of things really bugged me:It's much, much darker than the original movies (both figuratively and literally). Over the top nightmarish at times. Very much like Harry Potter in comparison to the originals which were much more Loony Toons.If you've seen the trailer you've seen many (most?) of the good lines and gags in the film. They picked out the cream for the trailer and if you've seen it then you've pretty much seen the movie. This was really annoying especially after having seen the trailers probably a dozen times over the last year.Lots of expository, relatively less physical gags. I couldn't help feeling that the filmmakers were treating this as somewhat of a chore. They needed to wrap up the series and so this, and this, and this need to happen to get there so let's march the characters in that direction. Too much time was spent getting through all this rather than just coming up with a fun movie.The first two movies are classics, and 10/10 in my opinion. This one is just OK, and not the light happy fun of the first ones.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

More or less it is not equal or more when comparing with movies like Avatar, up, even ""Day & Night"" also has some new concept to entertain us.Sorry folks this movie isn't great to pay for.

Friendship is Our Best Treasure,"Every summer, there is always one movie I ask all my friends to see.

Like previous submissions, the toys go through an adventure and discovers that selfish wants are never truly satisfying and friendship is our most valuable possession. Not only was this a rite of passage for Woody and the gang, it was also a life lesson for Andy, the new toys, and everyone in the audience. In typical Pixar fashion, a beautifully emotional script was delivered with strategically-placed comic relief and everyone in the theater experience both tears and joy - Pixar filmmakers have reached the holy grail of cinema and produced one of the best films of this decade.It will take more than ""The Hurt Locker"" to steal away a Best Picture Oscar from this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Who would have imagined that the bravest, most resourceful, loving, loyal, and lovable heroes of this adventure will be plastic and metal toys?How often does it happen that not even the first but the second sequel in the popular series will surpass two excellent predecessors on all counts and become a rare film, that would make even the most ironic and sarcastic male critics who could tear any movie to pieces with their harsh criticism shed a tear and not be shy to admit it?A very smart person said once: ""You need to write for children like you would for adults, but even better.""

"Wondrous, beautiful and something to remember.","From the looks of it, it seems Pixar will never go out of style nor will they make a mediocre or bad film. Once again, going back to that wonderful cast of characters we all love that includes the cowboy Woody, the spaceman Buzz Lightyear, as well as Jessie, Bullseye, Rex, Ham, Slinky and many more, Pixar doesn't just recycle old clichés and story lines. Rather, they use what they have already done and build upon that foundation to create a brand-new, exciting and fantastic adventure.Here we are, about 10 years after Toy Story 2 where we last left the toys saving Woody from being sold to Japan and adding a few new ones to the collection. Now, owner Andy is getting older and going away to college. The toys haven't changed, yet now begin to wonder what lies in their future. Will they be kept safe in the attic? Will they be donated and taken to a strange place? Or worse, will they be thrown out? What actually happens is so charming, fun, exciting and joyous to watch I can't even begin to spoil it for you. Let's just say that what follows consists of great jokes and sight-gags, beautifully animated set pieces and characters, and a huge amount of heart that practically no other animated film, or most films for that matter, can match.The animation is stunning of course, but the voice-over acting is really wonderful as well. Since most of them aren't huge stars themselves, we accept them completely as the characters they play. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are probably the only major stars of the cast, yet are just as captivating and emotionally-tugging to listen to as the supporting cast. And as always, what truly gets me in the end is the amount of heart and soul put into every production. As I sat there welling up at the beauty of the final sequence, I couldn't help but wonder in amazement at the originality and passion that so obviously had gone into the production. I guarantee this film will have a huge opening weekend and should have consistent staying power since it resonates so well with so many.

They are back to say a fitting farewell as Pixar play safe and emotional in equal measure.,"As Andy prepares to go away to college, Woody, Buzz, and co, face an uncertain future. It seems that their options will be to either be thrown in the trash or stored away in the attic. When a mix up occurs, the toys find themselves at the Sunnyside Daycare Centre and think they have struck lucky after being welcomed by kindly Lotso Bear. However, as Woody frantically tries to convince the others that Andy has not deserted them, it comes to light that Sunnyside is far from the toy paradise they thought it was.Already Toy Story 3 is breaking records left, right and centre. Boosted by a well earned reputation from the previous two film's in the series, and released in the now popular 3D format, Pixar's daddy was never going to struggle to get the punters into the cinema to see it. That fans have had to wait 11 years for this latest, and almost certainly the final, instalment, has also whetted the appetite considerably. Put simply, the film was guaranteed to rake in the cash before the ink was dry on the first critical reviews for it. The big question is if the Pixar team have managed to triumphantly close down this remarkable trilogy with a film to justify the record breaking.The answer is yes, tho in truth it probably wasn't really in doubt. However, part 3 has endeared itself to most on account of the emotional pull of the story itself. There's certainly nothing new in the structure of the characters, the same themes exist; toys fret about being left, toys need rescuing, the same neuroses are again evident. Only this time its constructed around a prison-break plot; Toy Story does The Great Escape with a bit of Cool Hand Luke thrown in for good measure. Why Pixar gets away with the familiarity is due to the smooth introduction of new characters, and the afore mentioned emotional weight that pulls away at the old heart strings. The need to move on, retirement, acceptance and casting off ones bitterness are all given the ""adult"" touch as the ""kiddie"" friendly caper unfolds.With that, part 3 is not as funny as what went before it. Yes it has its moments (Ken & Latino Buzz are high points), naturally, but they are never overtly hilarious moments. This is more about characters that we have grown up with, their humorous traits we already know about, its safe humour, Toy Story 3 is comfortable in more ways than one. But again Pixar get away with it (and we are happy to let them) because they have the balance right with the trilogy. Never too dark to alienate the youngsters (tho one sequence in the finale here brings mortality into question) and never too childish to send the adults to sleep, Pixar remain the governors of commercial family entertainment. The technical aspects remain first class, the animation is crisp and the action sequences continue to bounce off the screen. As for the 3D, this is not about flinging things at the audience, where the 3D works well for Toy Story 3 is that it lets the audience be on the same level as the toys. We are in their world, every nook and cranny enhanced, it's a fine world and one that further shows the genius at work by the Pixar mob.Inducing tears of pleasure and sadness, Toy Story 3 is undoubtedly a lovely movie. The closure to one of the finest trilogies to have graced the screen. But its record breaking performances should not lend one to think that it's Pixar's masterpiece, because it's not even the masterpiece of its own trilogy. It is, however, one of the highlights of 2010 so far and sure to entertain for many years to come. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The First Film I've Seen In A Theater in Over Nine Years ! ! !,"My hands, no, my whole body is trembling with delight as I try to tap out my simple, jumbled excitement. TS3 has so thoroughly entertained me, it's seems kinda wrong to call it a sequel. While the majority of the fabulous characters are familiar returnees from the previous installments, it stands completely on its own as a triumph of artful, inspired story telling. I haven't sat in a theater in nearly a decade - the hassle, the cost, and the hype all turned me off from movie going. But remembering how magical and deeply moving were TS1 & TS2, I didn't hesitate when I was invited along with some friends.If live action films could manage to express even half of the wonder and joy that this trilogy possesses, I might consider returning to the multiplex, but it's just not too likely. Today I'm more a fan of mature, serious films, that provoke thought and doubt and self reflection, but this remarkable franchise somehow manages to recharge my draining supply of patience with my fellow world citizens. At my age, 48, it's absurd to find such consolation and inspiration in an animated children's movie, but I'll take it wherever I can get it. (Wall-E, which I watched on cable, comes damn close with it's bittersweet comment on our seriously misdirected society.) John Lassiter and company have again succeeded at a level that even Steven Spielberg must envy. Bravo! WOW! Encore!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
One Of The Best!,"So I just got back from the 'advanced' screening of Toy Story 3 in China. Somehow we managed to show it 2 days before the 'Official' release. Anyways, I've waited 11 years for this moment, and its finally here. And I have to say, Toy Story 3 surprised me. In a good way. I never knew that an animation movie can consist such emotions, and still be child friendly. I would have to say, Toy Story 3 is way more mature than the first two movies, so little kids won't understand the more mature feeling Toy Story 3 provides. However, this movie still has the old Toy Story atmosphere, the personalities of the different toys. This movie is actually amazingly funny, too, my friends and I were bursting into laughter at Ken's letter. So for all you people out there, this is not the movie you would want to miss. In fact, watch this movie 2 - 3 times, because I know I'm going to do that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"A little better than 1 & 2, but I gave Toy Story 1 and 2 a perfect 10.............","I remembered first seeing the first part when I was 5 years old, Then the second part when I was 9, I gave both parts a perfect 10, Then, I'm still watching both parts till I was 19, (whenever I catch it on Disney Channel) and it still kicks ass! Don't worry, I'm not really fond of watching kid's movies, I'm also an emo who enjoys unhappy ending in many films. So when the 3rd part was released, I was really curious what will the ending be. What will the perfect 10 movie ends like? And how can Toy Story 1 & 2 can be surpassed by Toy story 3 when both already got a perfect 10? (In my book) Well, Toy story 3 answers all that question. It brings all justice to every toy in the 3rd film, Unlike parts 1 & 2, where Woody and Buzz would do all the hero part, All characters share their best job in part 3. They all showed their best to express their love to their respective owners. You won't be disappointed watching this. The adventure, villains, and friendship is still there.

U-n-b-e-l-i-e-v-a-b-l-e,"WOW!! Thats all I have to say! From the moment I walked into the theaters and until the credits rolled up I was beaming, bouncing off my seat - literally. This movie has just so much thought and depth into it it's incredible!Let me take a step back... I grew up on Toy Story 1, I loved it, thought it had a great message to it, a lot of humor, and just an overall fantastic movie. Now, Toy Story 2 came out and I was so excited! But then I saw it, and became deeply disappointed. I didn't enjoy the new characters, I didn't enjoy the story line, everything from top to bottom i didn't enjoy. It was because Toy Story 1 left me with such a good feeling that I could never imagine a movie from the same creators to go bad. I'm sure most of you will disagree with me on this one, but I just was not a big fan of the 2nd installment. Once I heard that Pixar was making a 3rd Toy Story I got sad. I thought that they already killed it with the 2nd one and I didn't know why they would butcher it anymore.Let me just be clear with all of you, I am such a big fan of Pixar and all of they're movies (other then Cars) and I get excited for every single one of they're movies, so I'm not a movie buff. I'm not just randomly criticizing, I'm being sincerely honest.Now back to Toy Story 3... I saw a couple of trailers a year ago, thought it looked cute, still had it's humor, but I didn't believe it could bring back the 1st one. I was wrong. Toy Story 3 had it all. The heart. The moral. The friendships. The loyalty. And above all - the humor. It was by far one of the greatest Pixar movies created (let alone ANY movie created) and i believe it'll make it's way to the Oscars, and god willing win some. This movie not only kept me smiling the entire time, but brought my faith back into Toy Story. I'm sorry if this may surprise anyone, but I think that this Toy Story was as good as the 1st, or possibly even better.I'm sorry if this wasn't the type of review you were looking for, but the reason why i didn't say too much about the film itself was because I do NOT want to ruin anything for you. I wish that all of you who read this go see this movie, whether your a 5 year old, or a 42 year old. It's enjoyable to all ages, and it'll never be forgotten.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Absolutely Amazing movie, fits in perfectly with the first 2.","I just finished watching this movie not more than an hour ago (released on the 16th in China, hence the 2 day head start on the US). I must say, it was an absolutely amazing film.Granted, I haven't seen the other 2 toy story movies in years. Yet from my fond memories of them, I can say that this movie ties in quite well with the others. Another reviewer mentioned that the plot elements are similar to the second film, yes that's quite true, however what movies aren't similar when you break them down to the core now a days? The ending was great, it was an excellent way to wrap up the film, and the trilogy (if they do end it with this). Unlike most films, I didn't once stop to check the time or see if the movie was almost over. When it was over it was a very fulfilling ending. I think that's one of the things that pixar is good at. None of the other toy story movies have left off with a cliffhanger ending and yet their still able to tie each movie together perfectly.As for the 3D effects, I honestly didn't really notice them. It does give some depth to the film but it seems like they just added it as a marketing tool more than anything. I didn't really notice any innovative or interesting uses of the 3D though that may just be because I'm thick.If you're wavering on watching this film, then don't worry, you'll come out happy, satisfied and you'll laugh quite a bit along the way. (though the rest of the audience didn't laugh as much as me but I'll chock that up to the subtitles not being able to convey what can only be understood through understanding the English)",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Decent,"Toy Story 2 saw cowboy doll Woody (Tom Hanks) realize his kid owner Andy (John Morris) would grow up someday. In Toy Story 3 he has: he's 17, he's headed for college, and he put his toys away long ago. After years of neglect, nearly being crushed in a garbage truck is the last straw. Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), Mr. Potatohead (Don Rickles), Slinky Dog (Blake Cark, replacing the late Jim Varney), and the rest of the family hop in a donation box headed for Sunnyside Day Care, a paradise on the outside and a death trap filled with rampaging, abusive toddlers on the inside.Pixar Animation Studios has never made a bad movie and their eleventh feature doesn't break tradition. Simply decent films like Cars and A Bug's Life have been known to surface, though, and Toy Story 3 ranks among them. Screenwriter Michael Arndt has nothing new to say, simply stitching together story and themes ripped from the first two. The toys have to escape a hostile environment to return to Andy (as in the original), and they must grapple with their feelings of abandonment (as in the sequel). Neither concept was a big focus in the movies they came from, so all Arndt has done is elaborate on places we've been before. His script doesn't become inspired until halfway through, when it turns into a prison break picture. Halfway through is too long a wait.But once Toy Story 3 gets going, it gets good. The action delivers genuine thrills, with an elaborate escape plan and a perilous encounter in a landfill. The humor, all too sparse in the beginning, creates gags like Buzz in Spanish mode and Potatohead as a tortilla. Whether this marketing dream come true is actually finished remains to be seen, but the heartfelt ending couldn't possibly be topped for emotion and meaning.Toy Story 3 leaves little doubt of its inferiority to its predecessors with an unoriginal story and a bad first half. Once the remaining scenes pick up, though, the movie becomes decent. That's a disappointment in the company of other Pixar works, but this one has moments of brilliance to show that decent isn't so bad after all.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Sayin' goodbye to my best friends. In the best way possible.,"I wanna all this stuff to be a part of my own life. Reviewing this title is not a simple thing to do: Toy Story 3 is not just ""a movie"", it's THE movie. Not just a silly way to spend about two hours of your life like all the other movies but something you won't never forget, something you'll bring with you until being buried. Because are characters like Buzz and Woody who make our lives special. When I'll think of my early life I won't remember stupid things that boys of my own age often do, I won't remember any idiot girlfriend, I won't remember how difficult school could be, but I'll remember the trilogy that made me dream, the trilogy in which I found my real friends.I think it would be idiot talking about this movie homing in on graphic or plot and so on. Because Toy Story has stopped to be just a movie for me eleven years ago. Then it's like if I'm talking about a friend or even something more. Just a few words to express my thoughts: One of the best things I've ever seen in my whole life. Here is the magic of life. Here life can be surprising. The magic which makes adults become children again. Disney Pixar showed us how magic life can be. I'm proud of acting like a child even if I'm already 19. But who cares...I prefer being a 12 years-old-minded boy rather than being an adult if this is the price to pay.It's the perfect moment to release this movie for me because this is my last year of high school and next year I'll go to university. Toy Story 3 is for me the metaphor of abandoning all my childish world, that actually I won't never abandon because my heart won't never be able to say g'bye to what changed my life forever.The movie's perfect in all its aspects, starting from graphics and arriving to screenplay and direction. I think it's not useful to talk about this.FOUR WORDS: The best movie ever.Bye Woody, Bye Buzz. I won't ever forget you. I will love you forever. Thank you .Giacinto, Italy",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Yet another masterpiece (!),"This film is a masterpiece. Truly. It is easily the best film of the year of any genre and will definitely take it's place alongside Bambi, Snow White, Fantasia and (insert other Pixar title here) in the Pantheon of immortal animated classics.TS3 is hilarious, touching, thought-provoking and relentlessly entertaining. The film is also very deep, even in comparison to the last three Pixar films (Ratatouille, Wall-E and Up).Between the high and low brow gags, TS3 manages to be a profound morality study on the purpose of life, connection and disconnection, consumerism, the transition into adulthood, the wonder of imagination, and on death and renewal. As that wasn't enough, there is a brief (but profound) dissertation on the origins of political power (borrowed directly from the great philosophers of the Enlightenment), given by the most unlikely character (I'll let you find out who, but it left me howling with laughter.)The comedy content is razor-sharp. Spanish Buzz is a scene-stealer and the gender-identity confused Ken is pure gold. However TS3 is certainly darker in theme and content that its predecessors and I sincerely question the G rating (If ""The Incredibles"" was PG then this certainly must be).But Pixar don't issue the ratings and regardless, there are moments of such aching beauty that your heart will damn near burst. Pixar kindly provided some delightful sequences over the end credits to let grown men such as myself wipe away the tears before entering the lobby.Does it have a flaw? Yes - it is at least an hour too short(!) I wanted more of the familiar characters and much, much more of the new ones, particularly Bonnie's toys. (BTW - Look out for a delightful homage to Hayao Miyazaki at Bonnie's place).But ignoring my pettiness, all I can say is this is a triumph in every regard. It is easily the best of the Toy Story series (an astonishing achievement in itself) and many will declare it Pixar's finest effort to date.

"Not hilarious but just an excellent all-round film with poignancy, adventure, comedy and drama in one wonderfully animated package","It was during a recent trip back home to Northern Ireland to see my parents that I ended up seeing Toy Story 3 – a film I had been looking forward to seeing for a while. This meant that the film was in 2D (which I was fine with – not a big 3D fan) but also on a smaller than average screen, which irritated me a little given that it was in combination with my parents desire to sit far from the screen. During the trailers I was a bit annoyed by this as I felt the film was a mile away and I thought this would contribute to me feeling remote from the film itself.This worry failed to materialise because very quickly I was thoroughly engaged with enjoying the main feature. It has been years since I saw either of the first two films but I remember them being very strong indeed and this second sequel offers more of the same in terms of quality storytelling and production. I seem to remember the other two films having more big laughs and more rapid fire comedy to them, but this might just be my memory. TS3 is not as hilarious as I had expected it to be, but it does still manage to be funny with plenty to laugh at in the detail, the ideas and the dialogue. More than comedy though the story is the all and it is not only very well written but also very well realised and delivered.Although I did not cry (as many critics claim to have done) I did find the film to contain just the right amount of poignancy and for it to be done in the right way so that it is touching and personal without becoming obvious or cloying. Aside from this though the main thrust of the film is an adventure with moments of thrills, genuinely dramatic moments and one specific scene (in the incinerator) which is incredibly dark considering this is a child's film (dark in a good way, not disturbing or bad). It is impossible to put I on one thing but it is telling that, considering the sheer technological feat that is your average Pixar film, one almost forgets the animation simply because of how good the story and storytelling are.Of course the animation should not be forgotten because it is excellent. Not only is it technically impressive but it is rich in detail and done in a way that deserves awards for cinematography, lighting and set design if it was not for the fact it is all animated. In fact both the animation and storytelling compliment each other perfectly simply because the animation is so good it allows the viewer to totally accept the world of the narrative while the narrative is strong enough to prevent us being focused on the technical aspects. Within all this it would be equally easy to forget the voice cast simply because so much of the performance is done on the faces and body language of the characters (which is back to the animation again). Hanks, Allen, Cusack, Harris, Rickles, Shawn, Ratzenberger and all the usual cast do great work yet again to deliver the emotions as well as the wit, Hanks in particular is great as he has to carry a lot of that. Keaton and Beatty are the standouts from the new voices but the use of Dalton, Goldberg, Garlin and others is also welcome.Toy Story 3 is yet another triumph from Pixar – a stable that makes it look easy almost every time. At a time when film franchises are make a third film simply so they can make a 3D film, the Toy Story series do not let the standard drop even slightly and produce a very strong film across the board, from technical to storytelling. Who would have thought that one of the best film trilogies made would be a family cartoon about toys that come to life when the humans leave the room?",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Have never cried so hard.,"I'm a 16 year old boy, I'm not a crier at all. I'm not saying that to sound tough, it's just something I never did a lot. I grew up on Toy Story and Toy Story 2 and both where and still are amazing movies that are very loved by me.I went in saw this one by myself with medium expectations... Mainly because the trailers really didn't get me too excited. Everyone has been talking about how they cried at certain scenes.. I knew I wasn't going to cry.... Boy was I wrong.I have never actually have had the full relief feeling of crying until I saw this movie. Not only did it deliver the nostalgia feeling that I miss so much, but it also was just an amazing movie with a great story and such great scenes.The humor had me laughing so much, I felt like I was 6 years old again. The characters where just as they should have been. I loved every minute of them. The new characters where awesome too, especially Ken. He made me laugh so much sometimes.So through most of the movie I was laughing. Then towards the end, there is one very intense scene where I was on the edge of my seat the entire time worrying and was afraid i might bust into tears. So, once the scene was over, I sat back to watch the ending of the movie.. Thinking, well at least I didn't cry.Then came the last scene..I lost it. I put my hand over my mouth and began to cry. Tears of Joy/Happiness. Then as the scene was almost over, I busted into a waterfall. I didn't care what anyone thought, I was about to fall on my knees and cry.I think it was just the nostalgia over flow and the love that is shown in the scene. It was just such an emotional roller coaster for me.The voice acting is fantastic. The story is great, it fits so perfectly with the other Toy Story movies. It's just a lot more tear jerking. I don't care how old you are, how tough you think you are, you will at least shed one tear.This is a MUST see.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A well done finish to an excellent series,"Pixar did start it well and finishes it even better...The two first opus were about the meaning of true friendship despite differences. This time, it is about survival and how we end up as toys: in a day care centre, in a cellar or just down in flames in a city dump.I saw it in French (excellent french Canadian dubbing. Wishing the same for the Parisian one...). Despite the 3D which I would have put aside, the movie fits well with the above question: where are we ending as toys when our master grows up ? If Woody ends up with Andy going at College, will the rest survive the test of the Day Care Center where children play with toys carelessly, and ruled by a ""so-called lovable"" evil Teddy Bear ? It's up to Woody to think of a plan, or all may end up in a grisly fate...Barbie and Ken also steals the show in this one. Never knew someday they would be in something better than their ""promo"" movies...Pixar done it again... and even brought me to tears in one point.Bravo again to this team of great innovative animators, and a great voice cast indeed !",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Incredible movie.,"Being a big Pixar fan and having loved the previous two Toy Story movies, I went in expecting a fantastic film. All I can say is that I was definitely not disappointed.

Especially as someone who is quickly facing ""the end of their childhood"", this movie really hit home for me. I don't know how Pixar manages to make all of these incredible films, but it definitely succeeded with this one. In addition, it really is a film for all ages, although it may be directed most to those around my age, those of us who grew up with the trilogy.

"Blown Away, Best animated movie ever","You're probably wondering if Toy Story 3 can possibly hold up against its nearly perfect predecessors. I wonder the same thing as I walked into the theater. Now, while the third movie in a trilogy is never good (with few exceptions) the wizards at Pixar have puled yet another winner out of their hat. Never have I been more entertained, touched, or learned more from an animated movie. This is the movie which not only all animated adventures be judged against, but all family movies. Toy Story 3 is a remarkable movie that will make you laugh and perhaps even cry. The script is extremely witty for the most parts, most of it aimed at adults. The voice cast is fabulous and the new characters fit in like a fish to water. All of the ""core characters"" (Woody, Buzz, etc.) complete their ""character arc"" becoming some of the most dynamic characters in recent memory. The actual animations have received a major overhaul, and are now some of the most beautiful computer-generated graphics ever. Using the lush, glow seen in Ratatouille and much darker, shadowy lighting that you would expect in the Godfather, Toy Story 3 generates as much tension as possible. Toy Story was is one of the most beloved movies ever. Toy Story 2 matched the original in all regards. Toy Story 3 however leaves them all behind.

From the beginning till the end, every single moment is fun and endearing. Pixar got it all right; coming up with new situations and exploring new territories but never destroy or alter what we loved about these characters. Woody and Buzz by now should be acknowledged as a whole generations' childhood memories. We have grown with them, shared with them, felt for and with them and experienced with them so many.And a strong reference to the voices: Tom Hanks and Tim Allen. If they were not in it, I don't know if this could work the same way.

Satisfactory,"Toy Story 3 retains the feel of the first two movies. It does remind you what it was like to be a child, and the tone of the movie is spot-on, certainly worthy of holding its place in the series. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, but I must say that I didn't find it to be as fantastic as the first two.In terms of effects, sound, voice-work, the movie is spot on. The only thing somewhat lacking is the script. While it may not be terrible, it seems to just be average. There isn't anything in this film that wasn't in one of the first two, aside from the theme of maturity Andy goes through, which was rather well done. The moments that were meant to be funny were amusing, but not as hilarious as hoped.I like short reviews that summarize the quality of the movie without spoiling it, so I'll say no more.

If there's some sort of potential gag involving a toy, Pixar has officially milked it for Toy Story's cash-grabs.If you don't like gags involving toys, I'm not sure if this cartoon will be up your alley.The plot, again, is about toys going from point a to point b, rescuing a toy, and trying to survive in a world of abusive children.

Thank God i was wearing a 3D glasses..,"so my brother can't see me cry like a girl. No words can describe this movie. It was just simply brilliant. From the story to the animation, it was amazing. It has been 15 years since the first movie. I loved all the toy story movies, it has been a part of my childhood. And i love Pixar films, since the first Pixar film to the latest one, i loved it and toy story 3 is definitely in my top 3 best Pixar films. It's so refreshing to see the characters again, and with the animation they look so much better. Toy story 3 has set the bar high, it is emotional (especially at the end). The ending part is totally my favorite (i cried like a baby). This movie is about friendship and letting go of things that are important to us. So for anyone who is looking for a film that will touch your heart, definitely watch this! it will not disappoint you. Pixar makes the best movies out there! I recommend this film to everybody! 10/10 stars!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
one for the ages,"Some things you cannot explain - some, you must experience to feel the impact. I wouldn't do it justice trying to write a review of the movie, but I will say that to lure the parents into taking the kids to this show, then making the adults feel the emotional roller coaster that is not only growing up, but also saying goodbye to loved ones... BRAVO pixar, bravo. This movie was so brilliantly written, and the talent was so flawless, it has officially topped the list of ""movies that made this grown man cry"" (knocking field of dreams out of #1, for those who care).

Takes Me Back,"I saw the first Toy Story film when I was six. Second when I was 9. It was worth waiting over 10 years for the third installment. When I went to the theatre to watch it today, I only saw one family and everyone else were my age, in their 20s. Nothing was messed around with. Actually maybe one thing... I will discuss that shortly. The original voice cast was brought back, Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack, Wallace Shawn and Don Rickles. The story structures were kept intact, toys escaping from concrete areas. Since Pixar's technology has really developed, so have the environments and you will experience them in 3D pretty well. It has a lot laughs, some tears. Only one thing that may have been messed with was that Buzz Lightyear got reprogrammed in Spanish. This movie should take you back.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
No toy gets left behind.,"Toy Story 3 is a comical new adventure in Disney Digital 3D that lands the toys in a room full of untamed tots who can't wait to get their sticky little fingers on these ""new"" toys. It's pandemonium as they try to stay together, ensuring ""no toy gets left behind."" Meanwhile, Barbie comes face to plastic face with Ken (yes, that Ken). (Disney, Pixar)The third movie curse. Time and time again have shown us that the third film of every trilogy is always the weakest of the bunch, and it's usually true. However, since this is PIXAR we're talking about, TOY STORY 3 is a huge exception (emphasis on the word ""huge""). In fact, I'll go further and say that TOY STORY 3 is the best in the trilogy, by far. Unlike most PIXAR films, the first two Toy Story films never try to be profound. They have always been about it's lovable, plastic, toy characters portraying true, human emotions and that's what makes them so brilliant to begin with!TOY STORY 3 is no different. We see our beloved characters return to the silver screen again for their last adventure, and it's a big one. The story also carries more weight. Like SHREK FOREVER AFTER, there's a lot at stake compared to the previous films, so much so that the characters' lives are at risk, which is appropriate, considering this is the last film and all. Although the darkest of the bunch (you'd be surprised how much PIXAR could squeeze into this G-rated flick), the film manages to perfectly blend the dark moments with light-hearted moments. In fact, TOY STORY 3 is hilarious, filled with witty jokes and perfect comedic timing from the toys! The toys!The story is well written, thanks to Michael Arndt, who also wrote the script for LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE. It's different from the previous PIXAR films in a way that there is a lot of suspense and excitement going on. In fact, there's a sequence in the third act that had me on the edge of my seats and crying at the same time! How that sequence alone could pass the MPAA's G-rated standards is beyond my knowledge. The film also gets its try at the horror genre, and I have to admit, they are legitimately scary.As said before, most of our characters return, although some, most notably Bo Peep, are not to be seen, which is kinda depressing for me. However, we get to meet some new characters along the way, my favorite being Ken, Barbie's love interest. He's such a fantastic, colorful character and he provides most of the film's funniest jokes. I also liked Trixie, the new dinosaur, although she was underused in the film. Oh, and I loved what the filmmakers did to Buzz Lightyear. I'm not going to spoil it but it's very funny.What brings this film on a level far greater than the first two films is the theme of being able to let go, which us movie goers will also have to go through when watching the film and because of this, it reaches a deeper emotional depth than ever before. I guarantee that you will cry in this film and if you don't, you might as well be a robot. The animation is also substantially better than the previous two films' already impeccable animation, showing how far even Pixar's technology has advanced.As a send off to the series, TOY STORY 3 can't be any more perfect, especially the last scene. The opening sequence alone is worth the price of admission just because it brings back the nostalgia from the two previous films. The film is filled with suspense, romance, adventure, horror, comedy, and, let's not forget, heart. While other movie studios try to release good films (yeah, right), PIXAR is the only movie studio that has gotten all 100% of their films right. See this film not because it's the last time we may see these characters. See it because it's a cinematic masterpiece, an end of a golden era. It's the best film of the year so far. Let's hope a TOY STORY film finally receives the Oscar it deserved fifteen years ago.It should also be noted that the short that appears before this film, DAY & NIGHT, is bloody brilliant. The short is so original, so wonderful, so mind blowing that it's an obvious Oscar contender for Best Short. I'm still awestruck at how original the short is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"An Excellent Use Of 3D, As Well With A Great Story Line","I noticed that most films in 3D today, wow audiences by usage of superb 3D effects. Here's the problem, movies are now so much based on fancy 3D, they loose focus of storyline and character personality / development.In Toy Story, I noticed the focus on 3D was minimal, as they focused more on the story, and telling the story in a way that it will be special.Essentially, the whole gang (with the exception of a few) is there, and you've got the classic scenario we all go through as kids, and that is that you eventually have to put away your toys, and face the fact that you are growing up. There is a special connection between Andy and his toys, namely Woody. A connection that many kids have with at least one toy.The story has some jokes that adults understand, as well as ones kids understand. When you can have that in a story, you're obviously going to have a well put together plot with plenty of good jokes.The balance of 3D and story was PERFECT. It had some nice 3D moments, but generally it's a movie you can enjoy equally as much in normal 2D view.Toy Story is the only series I can say that I liked equally the same for ALL of the films. Each has superb writing, and each has a good cast as well as likable characters.Sadly, all good things must end, way to go out with a bang.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Toy Story 3 Makes For One Of The Finest Trilogies,"Very rarely does a movie live up to its 'predecessors'. The 'Toy Story' sequels did it twice. I was out and out amused by 'Toy Story'. I loved 'Toy Story 2' and now the third film is just as remarkable. The talented people at Pixar know how to give gems.For me, 'Toy Story 3' holds tremendous nostalgic value. I recognized many of the toys that I used to have as a child (and have long since been removed from shelves in toy shops). All 'Toy Story' films express the significance of toys in people's lives, like how toys help develop creativity and imagination, nurture attachments and relationships and how symbolic they are. This one shows how, as children grow up and move to different things, toys hold lesser value to them. What was once so precious to a child that he would spend hours of the day with, will eventually end up stored in a carton or thrown away. I could relate very well to the Andy character and how it was difficult for him to let go of what was so precious to him when he was a boy.Visually, 'Toy Story 3' is just as delightful, colourful and vivacious as its prequels. It's loaded with energy. The cool gang that included Woody, Buzz, Jessie, Lotso, the Potato Heads, Rex, Hamm and friends are back for another awesome adventure. Some very interesting new characters have been introduced. The voice cast is as excellent as ever which isn't much of a surprise since it includes Tim Allen, Tom Hanks, Joan Cusack, Ned Beatty, Don Rickles, Estelle Harris, Jodi Benson, Wallace Shawn and many more.Easily, this little gem makes 'Toy Story' one of the finest trilogies. Needless to say, it's the best of what I've seen of 2010 thus far and I couldn't recommend it enough to anyone.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
I don't know...,"Toy Story. I love it. When I was a kid I never watched the whole movie for some reason just parts but my classmates were talking about it a lot. So when I was like 15 I finally decided to watch it and I just loved it. Of cause back then there wasn't part 3. But now there is. So the story is about our toys getting to the kiden(I don't know how to spell it) garden. And how they didn't like there and tryed to escape. Oh, good old Hollywood. So the story is OK I guess I didn't enjoy it as much as part 1 and 2 but... Animation is good although I liked Tangled better. Acting is awesome. So are the songs and sound. Now to the bad. I think I didn't like this movie that much (although I liked it) because it takes itself way too seriously. It's not nearly as funny as 1 and 2. Yes there are a lot of characters and I guess it's suppost to be good but I don't think it's such a good thing. You don't get to know them well anyway. First parts didn't have that much characters but were so much better. So the movie with OK plot, a lot of characters, good animation and lack of humor. But you know that you would watch it don't matter what. It's you're childhood.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A bit too grown-up for the kids,"When making sequels one always has to make the conscious choice to keep the story going on in the same time line as the film or not. In this case the decision was made to have the film and its characters age at the same speed as the real world - and that makes for some effects. Andy is now ready to go to University and has left his toys untouched for many years. Now that he's about to leave his parental home the question arises what to do with the toys. Will it be the safety of the attic, or the trash-can or some other fate? To me this film was tilted just a bit towards the audience of the first film and no longer really towards the kids in the audience. My own kid loved the film anyway - even though he had some questions about some of the things that happened and I found the film a little too gloomy. Life isn't perfect, but that doesn't have to be displayed so openly in a children's film IMO.When it comes to animation this one does what it is supposed to do. It's great to watch all the characters and their surroundings move along and the color scheme is very pleasurable. The story runs OK, but as said before it's a bit too gloomy to my taste.7 out of 10 snakes in boots",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
No criticisms,"I cannot think of any faults or criticisms for this movie. I fail to find even a single flaw or tiniest nitpick in any of the film's aspects. I consider this a good candidate for the title of the greatest movie of all time.Every single thing is polished to a mirror shine. The story is full of humor, sadness, tension and loveliness. The characters are all hilarious and likable, yet they all have distinct personalities and traits. The animation is beyond gorgeous and the movie is full of colour, which is used very effectively to create a matching atmosphere for each scene. The comedy, both physical and verbal is brain-debilitatingly hilarious, especially a certain scene involving Buzz Lightyear and the word ""reset"".There's really no point to continue this any further.

Does something most sequels fail to!,"I was probably about 8 when I first saw Toy Story, and like everyone I loved it, the same with Toy Story 2, they were somehow really enjoyable whether kid or adult.As time went one I'd wondered if they'd ever make a 3rd, and thankfully Pixar did. As everyone knows, sequels usually tend to go stale and never live up to their predecessors, Terminator 1 & the height being 2 for instance before Terminator 3 and 4 were okay at best. But Toy Story 3 somehow manages to be, perhaps better than the last two! And after more than 10 years this is a very good thing. Pixar are wonderful because not only do they manage to create things that appeal to both kids and adults, but they genuinely care about what they create, they aren't like EA or Apple, don't rush out poor creations due to greed greed, and this isn't more apparent than in Toy Story 3. Though a bench mark back in the late 90's, the animation now is better of course, a lot more colourful and vibrant, and despite being a animation it is at times more emotion evoking than most films.If for some reason you've not seen it yet, then what are you waiting for!

Funny Heartwarming Family Fun...Outstanding!!,"Just as good as the first two. Outstanding family movie, funny for kids with bits that adults will love. It is amazing how Pixar/Disney finds new way to keep the story fresh. It has been 15 years since the first Toy Story, and they found a way to work that into the movie.We saw it in 3Dthe 3D did not add many items flying at your face. So save some money watch the regular version, in fact avoid the 3D glasses eye strain.I do not want to give anything away, but I have to point out some of my favorite parts. The part of Andy growing up and outgrowing his toys, reminds me of my own kids who are growing up and loosing their childhood ways. And the ""Buzz Lightyear Spanish mode"" was brilliant. And the extra music done by the Gypsy Kings was fantastic.It is amazing how many great actors lend their voices to these movies, Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, Joan Cusak, Michael Keaton, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenburger and others. Ned Beatty did a brilliant job of voice acting for Lotso, he reminded me of Phil Harris (Baloo, Jungle book).

"As much now as it was then, Toy Story 3 is a masterpiece!","We say it Pixar film after Pixar film, and here it is again: ""Pixar does it again!"" ""Toy Story 3"" successfully continues the Pixar tradition of excellence in animation and film story-telling that began 15 years ago with the first ""Toy Story.""I don't know how they do it but the excellent screenwriters was able to shake up the old ""Toy Story"" themes of abandonment, friendship and loyalty into this wonderful script bursting with fresh humor, exciting action and above all, rich and heart-warming emotion. Never mind that we were watching toys on screen, but these characters were as real as people we hold dear. We are drawn into their dilemmas and we root for them to find their salvation.That hyper-exciting nail-biting scene in the garbage-disposal facility is a masterpiece in suspense. I was in awe at the vivid and highly complex sequence of animation on screen. When I looked at my 8 year old son beside me, he too was in total awe. It was amazing.If the last Pixar film ""Up"" made us cry in the first 10 minutes, I think there was no dry eye in the theater (especially adults) in the last 10 minutes of ""Toy Story 3"". The sincerity of the dialogue and the highly charged execution was beautiful. Even that final catch in Andy's breath as he finally drove off to college was so intense with emotion.The voice acting was pitch perfect, especially Tom Hanks and Tim Allen who got Woody and Buzz down pat. The new duo of Ken (voiced by Michael ""Batman"" Keaton) and Barbie (voiced by Jodi ""Little Mermaid"" Benson) was very funny.What more superlatives can I write to convince you to watch this special film? It is a contender for the top spot in many a fan's Pixar favorite lists. It will surely be in contention for the Oscar (even for Best Picture) at year's end.

Toy Story 3 will be remembered,"When I first learned of a third entry to the Toy Story series, I was on IMDb looking up some information from one of the earlier Toy Story titles. When looking up either Toy Story or Toy Story 2, my eyes saw a link to a Toy Story 3 page, set for 2010. When I saw this, I was both excited and a bit worried. I would once again see my favorite toys up on the big screen in an all new adventure, however I was skeptical as to how well this could be pulled off. Even though it was Pixar working on the film, I had trouble seeing just how a good third Toy Story could be made. Take the Shrek franchise for instance; Shrek the Third was not only unnecessary, but also not a very good movie in the first place. Well, the years went by and I finally saw a trailer for the Pixar film; it nearly moved me to tears. The idea that Andy was moving away, leaving the Toys behind was enough to make me pre-order my tickets. I thought it was a great story line. However, as the date for the moving got closer and closer, I was a bit upset with how they revealed much of the plot through their YouTube page. They talked about how the day-care was not what the toys originally thought it was going to be, and how there was going to be a prison escape. Then I actually saw the film, and was blown away. Pixar did not reveal an eighth of the story as I had feared they did. The animation, the story, and so much more all come together to make not only the perfect third entry to a franchise, but the perfect ending of a trilogy. The Toy Story trilogy is now complete, and it feels that way. This movie will be remembered, and it deserves not only the 9.4/10 that it currently stands on IMDb, but the 100% it hold at RT. I applaud Pixar for this amazing film, and can not wait to see what they do next.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pixar's toy box,"After a slightly slow and perhaps over-familiar opening sequence, Toy Story 3 develops into something more involving and complex than its predecessor - albeit one that lacks the jaw-dropping novelty of the original.Typically, Toy Story 3 doesn't skimp on the grown-up themes: neglect, isolation, as well as growing up itself, of course. There are also bubbling subtexts, like Ned Beatty's Lotso coming across as some kind of manipulative Southern slave-owner, with a patriarchal ferocity born of the trauma of disempowerment. Then there's Jesse (Joan Cusack) - far from being the obedient monogamist of Old Disney, her affections aren't so much torn as shared equally. She was made to love Woody, but why not Buzz too? (Jeez, that's some sentence.) The sophistication doesn't stop there. At one point, the narrative breaks into three strands. And when Buzz breaks into 'Spanish Mode' (one of the film's funniest extended jokes), we're offered another rarity for a mainstream children's film: subtitles.Equally successful - and the real draw for the target audience - is the slapstick. The action in part 3 is a step up from its predecessors. The escape from the sinister Sunnyside kindergarten is worthy of the greatest prison breakout movies. There is a brilliant visual gag involving Mr Potato Head and a pigeon. And finally, the ending feels like Lord of the Rings' Mount Doom, except with a less feathery deus ex machina.There is a sneaking sense of overkill in terms of the sheer wealth of characters. But then for every underdeveloped Mr Pricklepants (Timothy Dalton) there's a hilariously conflicted Ken (Michael Keaton), so it's churlish to complain. And there are some truly weird creations amongst the cast: Chuckles (Bud Luckey) sidesteps the creepy clown cliché to come across as a wellspring of pathos, while Baby, with his superhuman strength and his lazy eye, is probably the most horrifying henchman since Richard Kiel opened his gleaming jaws.Pixar may have made better films during their extraordinary existence; but this film, and the franchise as a whole, will always be their best toy box.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Good, but disappointing","In 1995, Toy Story was released, and my 7-year-old self loved every minute of it. Four years later, Toy Story 2 came out and, while not quite as good as the first, it was still an excellent film. The characters and plots of these films are, and will always be, near and dear to my heart. I, like everyone from my generation, couldn't have been more excited to see Buzz, Woody, and the gang for one last romp; the results of this 11-year wait for a sequel are commendable, but underwhelming.The movie begins with a mind-blowingly fun action sequence taking place in Andy's imagination. We are then treated to a short montage relating the story of Andy and his toys as he steadily grows older. Both sequences are very satisfying.As the movie continues, we meet up with Andy at age 17. He's ready to go to college and has to decide what to do with his old toys. Although he wants to put them in the attic, they accidentally almost get thrown out, but eventually they wind up at a daycare center. Everything seems great--what with a plentiful supply of children--but things are not what they seem. It turns out that the paradise is more of a prison, and thus the gang must escape and return home before it's too late.Here is where the movie sags and seems to go on autopilot. Though I won't spoil anything important, I will say that this is the third movie in row where woody is separated from the gang, the third movie where there's a rescue involved, and the third movie where we see buzz in ""space ranger"" mode. There are a few good gags throughout all this (I laughed really hard a couple times) but it's pretty mediocre over all.All of that changes in the last half hour though. To mention anything would spoil it, but suffice it to say that there's a harrowing sequence in a dump that's just heart wrenching. The ending moments are pitch-perfect as well, giving us the absolute best possible send off for the franchise. I'm not ashamed to admit that I cried twice in this last 30-minute stretch.It's a shame that a good half of the film is so average when the rest is absolutely superb. All in all, Toy Story 3 is a good, but disappointing and uneven movie. I was glad to see it, but whereas I usually can't wait for a Pixar DVD release, I probably wont pick this one up when it first comes out, rather I'll wait until the price drops.3.5 stars out of 5",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A wonderfully moving finish,"I will freely admit to walking into ""Toy Story 3"" with minimal excitement back in 2010. They'd wrapped things up nicely in the previous movie and this couldn't have felt more unnecessary. But man, do they make something good out of it.More importantly, they bring Andy's story to a close with satisfying results. Hugely emotional, too; our heroes wordlessly accepting their fates in a particular scene is masterfully done. But honestly, from that scene on, the heartstrings are being tugged constantly, and for me, it was just game over.In the end, the toys are in good hands and the future's bright. We didn't really need another Toy Story, but I'm happy to have this. It's a genuine effort that pays off beautifully.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"not for children, not for adults","These days, I watch movies in two ways. First, do I like it, second, would I show this to my children. As for the latter, I would not show this to my children (2 and 4) anytime soon. It has many dark scenes which would be too much. As for the first, did I like the whining and complaining and the occasional joke? Nah, not really. I don't understand why the rating on IMDb was so high. There is way too little humor in this movie. The rest of the scenes is not really anything we haven't seen before. A big Nazi bear who locks the hero's up and they try to escape the camp... did not get me smiling.

reminds me of my childhood,"Toy story 3 is definitely one of my favorite films ever. I watched toy story 1 and 2 when young, and i didn't have any practical concept about favorites at the time. Hence I would say that Toy story becomes my favorite quite recently. (but i am sure i enjoyed 1&2 a lot) Around the time when I am getting old and getting to forget about first and second series of toy story, i rushed into the theater right after hearing that toy story 3 is released. And some hours later, i found myself crying and this movie became actually one of my best. i must mention about the short but great story called 'day and night' shown before the movie. This brilliant idea and humanism Pixa makes always leads people to their childhood and purity even before the movie really starts. Such a great opening. While toy story 3 went, I could take lost parts of my childhood out to the real. It describes so well all the toys' feelings toward the process that one child who used to be the closest friend of them is actually moving on to a grown up who would not play with them anymore. And the fact that the process is a kind of destiny of human beings make it sadder. However, the film is not filled only with sadness. Of course on the one hand, it is quite tragic that toys got nothing but their human friends, and humans are destined not to take all of their toys to the society. On the other hand, however, it would suggest some ideas that we can possibly see the world in a different way. Toy Story 3 seems to change the trend and stereotype that toys only belong to children. As a genre, animation itself is usually considered as a child's one. but Toy Story 3 shows that grown ups actually can get impressed and enjoyed with all their hearts through animations. Toy Story 3 made me realize there were some moments I fell asleep hugging my toys and dolls. it was so nice and amazing to watch toy story again as an adult with the childhood memories. Another amazing fact! Toy story series itself has passed time and got old with us together. The producers, voice actors, and even the graphics.

However this movie blew my expectations out of the water. It was funny, cute, it had very emotional and sad parts making it almost a tear jerker. Then it swings back in and kills with a beautiful ending. They stayed true to the first two movies and kept everything perfect. They new toys at the daycare bring a fun new twist to the plot. The toys have been alone for so long with only Jessie and Bulls Eye being added that the introduction of the new toys was crucial.

"An Unbelievablly Solid Third Instalment,","Toy Story 3 is an outstanding movie with an immensely well developed plot and a stellar voice cast. Eleven years fans waited for this third installment of the beloved Pixar series, and I must say it does not disappoint one bit. Having the series work in real time, showing Andy growing up, was a terrific choice and made for a story certainly worth telling. It has a high octane, intense ""prison escape"" that is immensely well executed, it was clear that the writers did a lot of research on how to display this in a way that could feasibly work out with toys.This film also has a lot of emotional depth, with the final twenty minutes leaving me in tears, and I was very happy a movie managed to make me feel this way. I was taken on a genuine journey with these characters that was overwhelming in spectacle, as well as grounded in rich character development and arch's, it is also a kids movie about toys, believe it or not.The voice cast is as great as ever, the 11 year hiatus from these characters was clearly no big deal for them. Tom Hanks is phenomenal as always as Woody, it feels Tim Allen has never left Buzz, Joan Cusack is top notch still as Jesse and Don Rickles is as great as ever as Mr. Potato Head. Everyone is all around brilliant in their returning roles, and the new characters are also terrifically casted, fitting in to this universe nicely, such as Ned Beatty as the very layered Lotso, Michael Keaton as the very hilarious Ken and Timothy Dalton in an unexpected, pleasant role, as Mr. Pricklepants.Truly unforgettable 90 minutes. Sweet and hilarious, fans of the series and family members of all ages will love Toy Story 3.Andy is all grown up and plans to put the toys in to his attic before leaving for college, but they accidentally end up in a daycare center that they can not escape as a result of a ruthless teddy bear.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Great Chemistry,"The chemistry between our ensemble cast continues to grow from strength to strength, with the blossoming chemistry between Buzz (Tim Allen) and Jessie (Joan Cusack) being a primary highlight, thanks to the introduction of El Buzzo, which creates some genuinely funny moments to keep the audience laughing, while still developing the chemistry, without resorting to awkward humour or cheesy dialogue. I also have to praise the whole animation team at Pixar, who continue to go to infinity and beyond, with the animating skills getting better with every new release. And to have this film still ageing well after 9 years is a great sign of how this film will fare in the future. Some of their best work comes when they can truly go wild with their imagination, such as the opening fantasy sequence, and the climax at the landfill. While there are plenty of animation studios to choose from, I can't think of a better team than those at Pixar. Even when the material is subpar, you know the animators will make the film look so good, you'll cry.And after all the positives I talked about, it's really hard to say, but Toy Story 3 still remains my least favourite of the series. That's not to say this film is bad, far from it in reality! But since all four instalments of this saga are astoundingly good, something has to be at the bottom. And the reason part three's at the bottom? Simple, it tries hard to provoke an emotional reaction from it's audience. With an 11 year gap between this and Toy Story 2, (Lassetter, 1999) many fans expected the presumed finale would end off on a really emotional note. And at first glance, it does. But sadly, it's become clear to me through occasional re-watches, that the emotional moments are designed in a way that the singular reason some of them are there, is so the audience will have an emotional reaction.Scenes such as the intense furnace scene aren't bad moments, but the way the scenes play out feel like the emotional response was more of a priority than fitting these moments into the narrative.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A powerful and moving conclusion to the beloved Toy Story.,"I've known and loved the Toy Story movies since the first one came out in 1995. I was just a little kid then and the first TS was one of my favorite movies growing up. The sequel was great too, but maybe not quite as classic as the first. Now, after SO many years..we get Toy Story 3.Let me say that this movie..surprised me. From the previews I thought that the movie might be a little too ""gag"" heavy. The whole Spanish Buzz thing, combined with the Ken/Barbie stuff. I was a little skeptical. BUT I do know that Pixar rarely flubbs up on movies, so I went into the theater with pretty high expectations. I was quite impressed.The story: For me, the story gets a 9/10. It was a very solid story and the plot moved along pretty well. There was one scene that seemed to drag a bit, but that's kind of nitpicking.The humor: 8/10. I didn't laugh all /that/ much during the movie, but it did still have funny moments :)Music: The music was fine. I was paying more attention to the story, not the music as much. I believe the music would also get a 9/10.Emotional depth/quality: I do actually wish the movie had been a little more bold at certain points. I have to give Pixar props though for some of the scenes in the movie. This is the darkest Toy Story movie. If you thought that the climax of Toy Story 2 was intense..oh boy..you haven't seen nothing' yet! I'll give the emotional content a 9/10 as well.Appropriate: This movie is for children, teens,adults..anybody. Anyone who has ever loved or lost a toy will like this movie. Some parts honestly creeped me out a bit..and I'm almost 20 yrs. old. Don't let that discourage you from taking your children to see the movie though. I would exercise a little caution if you're taking really young kids to the movie. If they scare really easily you might need to like..cover their eyes at a couple parts. 9/10.Anyone who has seen and loved the first two Toy Story movies will enjoy this movie :) It was fun, intense, emotional..it had pretty much everything. I give the movie a final overall rating of 9/10.Thank you Pixar, for influencing so many lives and allowing so many children to grow up with your characters.So long, partner.-Debbie",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Again,"This movie is not better or worse than the other first two ones of the same puppet saga which means again that it's also good, a quality enhanced this time by the 3D version. The same technical perfection in animation, the originality, creativeness and inventiveness in the conception of characters and scenes, the great facial and body expressiveness of the former which confers them human features and a sentimental story of fraternity, friendship and tenderness (notwithstanding a few mean creatures precisely to strike the contrast). The visual effects are very impressive. A good movie to be seen both by children and grown-ups. Unfortunately I cannot give opinion about the voices of the actors and actresses that dubbed the puppets because I saw a Portuguese version talked in Portuguese.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
the same as the first two,"pixar is a great company and they deliver. between their great graphics and adventurous attitude when it comes to style they deserve praise. As a Trilogy it would function well except parts 2 and 3 feel almost identical. between the bitter scheming evil toy concept and the tearjerker flashbacks that are consistent this movie recycles the same material over and over again. I respect part 1 and even part two but as a trilogy I say poor form, the innovation in graphics is not represented in storyline. Thats not quite the bottom line though, the movie did have some unique bits that were quite fun, such as the buzz light-year mind wipe scene. then again I couldn't help but get the same feeling as when Woody was brainwashed by the prospector. too many parallels for me I guess.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Toy Story saga given a fitting end,"The rule of thumb has been the 3rd film of any franchise ends up bloated and overall, lacking the magic of the first two films. Not this time. As Disney/Pixar have proved time and again, Toy Story 3 doesn't suffer from bloat nor does it lack the magic. It is as fun, magical and heartfelt as the previous films.It would have seemed with Toy Story 2, the saga was completed. However, there was the overriding sense that there was one more story to tell. What happened when Andy eventually moved on. That is the crux of Toy Story 3; moving on.Our favorite toys start out looking like they will end up in the attic, but through the course of events, they end up going to a day-care. All would seem to be great, but as always is the case, looks are deceiving.We end up being introduced to some new characters. One of the biggest voice talent surprises is Michael Keaton as Ken. Keaton is fantastic and a big surprise. Ned Beaty is also wonderful in the role of Lotso. These two add considerably to the goings on. Hanks, Allen, Cusak, Rickles, Ratzenberg and company once again deliver fantastic character work.This film has plenty of what made the first two films some of the most beloved animated stories ever. Toy Story 3 adds a golden feather to the cap of the series and proves once again, Disney/Pixar are fantastic story tellers.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
One of the best sequels of all time,"I just got through watching Toy Story 3 and it is the greatest Pixar movie ever! Though the story was just like the other two films, the new characters such as Lotso, Big Baby, Ken, Buttercup, and Trixie make Toy Story 3 the sequel that it is. The ending almost made me cry because I knew that this was the last in the series since Andy departed off to college and Woody and the gang became fit with Bonnie's toys as a family. There is one thing I'll admit and it was the big baby-s face. In a way, it looked like a Chucky doll without hair. But that's the only thing I slightly didn't like about a character of the movie. Other than that, everything about Toy Story 3 is infinity and beyond with excellence and animation.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Easily the best Toy Story.,"This Toy Story is filled with emotion and touching moments, then hits you right with an absolutely hilarious gag. Once again, Tom Hanks brilliantly brings Woody to life, with the same holding true to Tim Allen and all the other voices for the toys. ***SPOILER*** Now, when the Toys accept ""death"" and all hold hands going into the incinerator, this touches you in the heart. Then they are saved by ""the Claaawwww"" (As the green aliens call it). When I was watching a sold out showing of this movie, the entire crowd erupted in applause and laughter. Never, EVER in my movie watching experience have I seen a crowd SO into a movie that they applaud when a character is saved. This shows the Pixar Artistry at work. Even in the incredible UP, (2009) no one applauded for Carl when he saved Russel. Enough said, GO SEE IT NOW",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
It's Official: Pixar can do no wrong,"All Pixar movies have a way of being an instant classic and being entertaining for kids and adults alike, because of their many emotional layers. Toy Story 3 is no exception.When I heard they were making a third, I had my doubts. Toy Story 1 and 2 were great movies, with humour and heart and a great story, surely, I thought, they can't do it again? I was very wrong. Toy Story 3 is just as great as the first two, maybe in some ways better. All our favourite characters are back for an amazingly funny, action packed animated ride.The story is as follows: Andy is leaving for college, but can't seem to be able to let go of a select few of his toys, ones that have meant the most to him. However, all of the toys ends up being mistakenly donated to a daycare centre, therein lies the problem and they have to figure out a way to get back to Andy and back to where they belong.The story is brilliant, with another dilemma around every corner, and lots of new characters. With high humour and high emotion at times, its a movie for all ages.Sit back and enjoy this one, you will not be disappointed, there is not a possible way to flaw this movie, definitely a classic movie trilogy that is going to go down in history. It's not every day a trilogy is formed when each movie is flawless and special in its own way. An enjoyable movie for all the family, no disappointment to be found.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"Awesome movie, even more so for 18 year olds :]","I remember watching the first two movies in the cinema when I was younger and loving them. Then when I heard Toy Story 3 was coming out, I was surprised at how excited I was! I just couldn't wait. Although I thought it seem silly for someone of my age to be sitting in a cinema full of kids watching Toy Story I was still determined to go see it.Turns out I wasn't the only one who has this idea, I'm sure there must have been more 17+ people than there were kids! Even though I was generally going to see it more out of tradition than thinking it would actually be a good movie for me to watch I loved it.It is possibly the best kids movie I've seen in the past few years, maybe Up was on par with it but that's it.10 out of 10 all the way.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The Storyline Was A Bit Too Much For This Instalment,"This instalment of the series is alright for everyone to watch and enjoy. I thought that there was a bit of extra content for the storyline. It somehow changed direction several times throughout the film. The cast selection was remarkably splendid. They nicely committed and connected to the storyline and to their respective characters. The chemistry between the cast members is great and strong.This instalment of the series reveals to viewers to never trust nor underestimate anyone, including yourself. I discovered this the hard way. I have never trusted myself. This film shows that the best idea for everyone is to carefully and closely examine their lives. This is a fine instalment to the series.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Where do I begin...?,"It has come to my attention that I write a lot of 10 star reviews. I hardly write any reviews for movies I hate! Why do I do this? The bad ones are far more fun to write! But, here we go again, another 10 star movie. Why do I bother? It is, by this point, a known fact that this movie is awesome. So why write about it? Because it is the very least I can do in order to express my gratitude to Pixar for sending off Woody, Buzz, and Andy with the very greatest third film in any trilogy ever. Pixar had to have sold their souls to the Devil. There is no way an animated film that is a second sequel can be this fresh and clever and charming and hilarious and nail-biting and awesome and perfect in every way. I grew up with Toy Story, like so many of the people who went to see it, and I love it, like EVERYONE who went to see it. I should never have doubted Pixar. They're geniuses, all of them.

Astonishing,"In 1995 I saw my first ever film in a cinema. Now I find it hard to explain the wonder I felt at the age of 3 as I watched the adventures of Woody, Buzz and co. At the time Toy Story 2 was not, in my eyes, a worthy sequel (of course I wouldn't have put it like that at the time) but now I see it for what it is, an excellent addition to a wonderful series. Today I saw the third instalment to the masterpiece and I can honestly say that this is the best. Toy Story 3 is, to my knowledge, the only film which has moved me to tears, the atmosphere created is that believable, that heart-rending whilst also redeeming itself to bring me to the film to end on a beautiful high.As expected of a film which is supposedly aimed primarily at children, the comedy is simple enough but still enjoyable. The heart of this film lies in the storytelling and the emotional connection which has been built over 15 of the 18 years of my life.Ignoring all of this, this is truly my favourite film which I have seen this year. Take into consideration that in the past 6 months I have seen the first two Godfather films as well as several other classics. See this film now.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
You do not wanna miss this,"People always believed that with trilogies, the third would always end up in a big mix up or a failure. Yet, let me tell you that toy story 3 will not be an upset. You feel connected with the characters during their adventures along the way, like you always had in the other movies. You feel happy when they're happy and sad, when they're sad. If you had liked the previous films, you will not want to miss this one. If you are afraid this will disappoint you, because you cherished the first ones, do not be afraid because this is the ending to all of them, and you will want to see how all of them make out at end. This movie should be seen by all types, because no matter what genre of film they like, this movie will touch their inner self, triggering the kid in all of us.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
One of Pixar's best,"I've been a Pixar fan since the original Toy Story came out in 1995, and they have yet to disappoint. Toy Story 3 is a joyous adventure, a heartfelt examination of what it means to leave childhood behind, and an existential meditation on fate and death. Not to mention a brilliant send up of prison break movies. Heady stuff for what is ostensibly a summer kids flick. But the movie never misses a beat, and never seems overburdened with its weighty subject matter. It's a Greek tragedy that doesn't take itself too seriously (the climax contains the most literal deus ex machina ever committed to film). There are some scary bits, like a ratty baby doll and an evil monkey toy that are the stuff of nightmares, not to mention a harrowing sequence at the end involving a city dump, so it may not be appropriate for very young children. The last ten minutes or of the film contain a similar emotional wallop as the first fifteen minutes of Up. Pixar knows how to jerk the tears.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
One of the best films to come along in a decade,"Toy Story 3 is one of those films that comes along once in a decade. It is truly one of the most clever, imaginative, special films I've seen in years.It's been 11 years since the last Toy Story, and in this (ostensibly) final chapter of the trilogy, we find Andy all grown up and heading off to college. Why a high school senior would still have a toy box full of childhood relics anywhere in sight is puzzling, but for the sake of the story, I'll buy it.The premise of the film lies in the fate of the toys now that they are no longer needed. Will they be shipped off to charity? Thrown away like trash? Or donated to the local daycare? The toys decide to take their fate into their own hands, and thus, our adventure begins.They eventually find themselves in a magical daycare wonderland. They're surrounded by loving children who will give them what they've been missing for so long – the imagination of a child that makes any toy come alive. There's only one problem – they've been banished to the toddler room where childhood toys meet a fate worse than the attic. There, they're used, abused and misused. They're regularly manhandled and stripped of all dignity by these terrible two's. They soon realize they'd rather be hidden safely away at their former owner's home than left to the whims of this group of unruly barbarians.Enter our faithful Woody to save the day. He is the only one Andy's chosen to bring to college with him, but he opts to risk being left at SunnySide with the rest of the toys to make sure his friends are freed from certain doom.We all know 'certain doom' is not an option in a Disney/Pixar film, unless you're the villain, but they certainly had me going there for a moment. Director Lee Unkrich was able to keep me on the edge of my seat (literally) until the very end. Along the way, we're introduced to a new crop of daycare toys – among them, a strawberry-scented bear who isn't as pleasant as he first appears to be, a Ken and Barbie pair who find love at first sight – and a drone-like hench-baby who had me in stitches from it's first scene.This is one of those films from which you'll come away preaching the gospel. Not once did I get the feeling the movie was condescending to children for the sake of cheap laughs or thrills. This was a film that proves you need not talk down to children to get their attention. It also proves that a film can be as entertaining for adults as it is for the under-ten set. I would imagine that since the first two films came out long ago, the majority of the children in the theater were much too young to have seen them – but they laughed and worried and winced and rejoiced in all the same places I did.The only drawback from not having seen the first two films is that you will not be as emotionally attached to the characters, and may not appreciate the bittersweet ending like someone who has grown up with these films. That, however, should not detract one iota from the film's effectiveness as a stand-alone movie-going experience.I tried very hard to come up with one solitary criticism for the film, and I honestly could not. It simply could not have been better-made. I rarely give a film I've just seen 5 out of 5 stars, but this film was as deserving of that extraordinary distinction as any great film I've seen – it's that good. I truly hate to over-sell a film, but with this one, honestly, I don't think that's possible. It had me from the word, 'go'.Disney/Pixar have outdone themselves in terms of sheer cleverness, wit, charm, humor, ingenuity and fun. This wonderful masterpiece is a testament to the notion that one need not mindlessly insert fart jokes, crass humor, sexual situations and foul language into a film for it to appeal to today's cynical audiences. Toy Story is everything a great movie should be. It tugs at your heartstrings without pulling them completely from their mooring – it's cute without being syrupy – and it has that wonderful timeless quality that is entirely too rare given the massive budgets, and overflowing creative talent that most major studio releases tout.At the risk of sounding like an old-fashioned prude, I'll say they just don't make them like this anymore. For my money, the entertainment world would be a much better place if they did.Upsides: An engaging, engrossing, uplifting, funny, smart, entertaining, witty, polished, imaginative, hopeful, creative, optimistic, best $10.50 I've spent at the theater in years-movie going experience.Downsides: Only that it spoils me to the inferior copy-cats that are surely in pre-production as I write.Rating: ***** (Our of 5 *'s)",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Smart Barbie and Beyond,"While I think I've been ripped-off recently with other 3-D experiences, (Alice in Wonderland especially), I knew that Pixar Studios wouldn't disappoint. Preceded by an absolutely charming confection, I was perfectly primed for the epic adventures of Buzz, Woody, and company. Andy is finally leaving home for the next phase of his life--one that won't include his plastic posse. His edited toys, sans Woody at first, are joined by Molly's Barbie for a trip to a strange new land. Part prison movie, part disaster film, the outrageous stakes have rarely been higher, and each act supported a clearly delineated narrative.Other new characters include the creepiest doll since Chuckie, a strawberry scented purple bear whose southern graciousness conceals a machiavellian desire for power and control. Ken, another iconic character, is as much of a surprise as the scary mechanical monkey is delightfully disturbing.I adored this elegant final chapter in the Toy Story Trilogy, and think some of the tears I shamelessly shed reflected the bittersweet feelings I have about most farewells.

Capturing the hearts of young and old,"Toy Story is one of the best, if not the best children's/family movies of all time. The children are captivated with the most fascinating toys coming to life while the parents/adults feel like kids again. It brings back the memories of your childhood toys. Since then there was Toy Story 2 which brought all your favourites back to life once again and a few more. But I have to say Toy Story 3 was on a whole new level where those children who's seen the first movies are now grown too and the parent's feel that sense of your child growing up and moving on to life of their own. It was an extremely sentimental movie to me, but still managed to bring many laughs. I can honestly say that I loved this movie and the whole Toy Story trilogy.

"Worth of watching, but not necessarily worth of the cinema entry price","Before watching the movie myself, I first read a couple of other reviews and even got surprised finding this movie no. 27 of top 250 movies. however, I don't think Toy Story 3 deserves such a high rank:The animations might not be the worst, but on the other hand they are not quite the best as well. I don't want to spoil anyone: The plot itself matches the level of a Disney movie: Not too complicated for small kids to understand, but not that interesting to keep you in front of the telly for the whole time. Nevertheless, one has to keep in mind that Toy Story 3 is mainly for children rather than adults, so it's not quite fair to compare it to adult-movies. It was entertaining at some points, but at some parts I wasn't quite sure whether something was supposed to be funny or not, so the tin-laugh would have been useful.As I said, I don't think Toy Story deserves the rating of 8.7 as compared to other movies, If you ask me it's ""worth watching"", but when going to the pictures, I'd think twice if it's really worth the 10 bucks.Hence: 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Most overrated movie of all time.,"Alright! I can feel the controversy beginning!But this was easily Pixar's worst movie. And the only one that I managed to properly dislike.Of course, being Pixar, it can't be all bad, and the plot, and the visuals, were pretty good. The plot in particular was great, except for one thing.This is not a kid's movie. How is it rated G? How? Why?The reason I hate it, and why it shouldn't be rated G, comes from one fatal flaw in the plot.It was terrifying! This might as well be a freaking horror movie! I saw this when it came out, when I was about six. And it traumatized me! It freaking traumatized me to the point where I still sometimes have nightmares about Big Baby and Lotso Huggin Bear killing me in my sleep!Not kidding. It's just terrifying. it might as well be Child's Play. Before watching this, I had no problem with dolls or anything. Now, I can't look at a baby doll without being terrified, all thanks to this movie.I can't even fathom how scary this was for me. I think that maybe now as a teenager I might have enjoyed it, but seeing it at the age of six has forever tainted my opinion of the toy story movies and toys. Would not recommend to anybody but horror fans. That's how scary this is.It's a straight up horror flick. That's all I can say about it.

Brilliant,"Good news: the new Toy Story movie is a sweet, charming coda to a endlessly endearing series. The dialog still crackles, the animation still sparkles, and the voice work still resonates. Well done all around.It's been 15 years since the original feature, and in movie time that means that little Andy is about all grown up. Well, headed off to college, anyway. As the movie begins, he'll be leaving for higher education in a few days and needs to figure out what to do with his Woody and Buzz and Jessie and Hamm toys, and others - does he donate them to the local daycare center, or does he put them up in the attic for safekeeping? That's really the question at the heart of the movie. Are the toys better off with Andy, in college - or somewhere else? They realize he's growing up, but surely he hasn't forgotten them entirely. And sure enough, we come to learn just how much these toys mean to Andy. It's a coming-of-age movie disguised as a Playskool parable.The gang's adventures lead them to the daycare center, where they meet up with a vast array of other toys, such as a Care Bear clone voiced by Ned Beatty, a Ken doll, and a Fisher-Price talking phone. One of the many hallmarks of this trilogy has been how well represented toys have been; obviously, Pixar (and Disney) spared no expense in getting the rights to some of these toys, which you have to admit is much better than the alternative: made-up toys no one cares about. That's a big reason the Toy Story movies work, of course, because they resonate with everyone. Each of us can see a piece of our childhood in the movie. That's why it bugs us when the evil neighbor kid or the evil toy collector do things to the toys, because they're not just toys to us - they're our toys, our lives, ourselves. To lay it on thickly.Anyway, what this one's all about is togetherness. Should Woody go with Andy to college while the others go to the attic, or wherever? Or should they stick together? The humor from the first two movies doesn't slow a bit, with wickedly whip-fast banter from Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head and John Ratzenberger as Hamm slicing the air with their barbs and trivia. There's even some mild character development - is that love I see between Buzz and Jessie? Another recurring theme in the series is that of abandonment. In TS2, Andy mistakenly put Woody in the family yard sale; here, the toys feel like they're similarly being put aside ""for later,"" knowing that there won't be a later with Andy all but grown up. There are also repeated friends-abandoning-friends scenes as well. And, it seems, each toy in these movies - well, the lead toys - has some kind of story about how their old owner loved them to pieces and then one day just abandoned them. That feeling of abandonment plays a huge part in this movie.There's just so much to like about this. It's simply great to hear Tom Hanks and Tim Allen playing their famous characters again. In fact, there really are no slackers in the entire bunch of voice actors, especially Joan Cusack as Jessie. (And, thank goodness, we get only a couple of snippets of Randy Newman's ""You Got a Friend in Me."") There are some sad scenes, but for the most part they're obscured by some really fantastic 3D action scenes (see Woody escape daycare! See the rest of the gang elude the trash truck! Thrill to everyone avoiding the incinerator!). In fact, the only really sad scene, the one that'll be sure to yank the heart out of all adults and no kids, is the one in which Andy's mom sees her son off to college. She cries, and so will you. It's not only the end of Andy's childhood, it's the end to all our Toy Story laughs.The third Toy Story movie is warm hearted and elegant, a end to the trilogy that will really make your heart soar. It's a beautiful, hilarious movie that should be required viewing for kids of all ages.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
To be 9 again - Toy Story 3 Review.,"As a 24 year old I grew up with the Toy Story movies, and they had a big impact on my childhood. I remember going to burger king many times getting all the Toy Story toys. So when I went to see the new movie, needless to say I had extremely HIGH expectations.The second the movie started, I didn't feel like there had been a 15 year gap between the movies. I felt right at home with all the toys again. It feels like the same movies that I grew up with, with some graphical improvements. All the old characters we know and love make a comeback, as well as some new ones, which feel like they were part of the story all along. Pixar did an absolutely brilliant job giving toys emotion. I found myself falling in love with all the old, and even some new characters all over again.The actual story line is brilliant. If it took 15 years to think up this perfect story line than it was well worth the wait. As I said my expectations were extremely high going into this movie, and they were surpassed and then some. Even though I am a grown up now, the movie took me back to an age of innocence and an let me be my 9 year old self for just a moment which is a truly magical feeling. Pixar is brilliant at creating a story line that both adults and children will love. They still sneak in moments that only adults will understand. My favorite example of this is a Cool Hand Luke reference. I won't say exactly what happens so as not to spoil anything, but someone intimates the warden perfectly. I found myself a couple of moments in the movie holding back tears to the point where my throat starts hurting. I just had to keep telling myself ""I'm not going to be the guy that cries at a Toy Story movie."" Lets take a moment to talk about the animation. In an article in Wired magazine, the creators of Toy Story 3 said each frame takes anywhere from 6-12 hours to render depending on the complexity of the scene. There are 60 frames in every second so lets do some quick math. It takes about 540 hours of rendering to produce one second of this movie. 32,400 hours to produce a minute. If you keep going and figure out how many hours the entire movie took, well you get a really really big number. The result is toys with more human characteristics, realistic looking fur, scenes with so much attention to detail you could watch the scene 100 times and still look at something new each time.The 3D effects weren't mind blowing or revolutionary. But hey this is a cartoon, and what better way to experience this movie than in 3D. There aren't any gimmicky moments (thank god). The best use of 3D was actually during the short before the movie called Night and Day. This short will just blow your mind I promise. But back to Toy Story 3there were some scenes that I can't talk about that really showed the capability of 3D and made you feel like you were right there with the toys.Is the movie worth the money? Yes. Is it as good as the old movies? It's better.You will laugh, you will cry, you will get an overwhelming scenes of nostalgia. Pixar knows how to bring an end to an epicly huge Trilogy. Thank you for the memories and the experience Pixar!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
You've got to admire the heart that goes into making these movies and it's especially obvious in films like this!,"'TOY STORY 3': Four Stars (Out of Five)Woody (once again voiced by Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and all of the rest of the gang are back for this third 'TOY STORY' adventure, eleven years after the last film. It once again rehashes the story of Woody and the others feeling threatened and unwanted by their owner Andy (once again voiced by John Morris) as he turns 17 and leaves for college. They're mistakenly dropped off at a daycare where tired older toys want them to be the sole victims of the wild and obnoxious children there. Only Woody knows they're truly wanted back home and does his best to rescue them and get them back to Andy.The film is only co-written by the original two films' creator John Lasseter and is directed by Lee Unkrich, who served as a co-director on 'TOY STORY 2'. It does seem a little old and drawn out at times, early on, but then it really builds to a somewhat seriously suspenseful and emotional conclusion. Some of the drama and humor seems forced but some of it feels really genuine and funny as well, especially as the film goes on. I don't agree that this is the masterpiece that some are describing it but it's definitely a lot better than most other kids' films out there (as most Pixar films are).The 'TOY STORY' movies aren't my favorites of the Pixar films; I really like 'THE INCREDIBLES' and 'WALL-E' the best, but they're definitely better than stuff like 'MONSTERS, INC.' and 'A BUG'S LIFE'. The thing you have to really admire about all of the Pixar films though is the effort and passion of the entire team of filmmakers that went into making them; this is definitely obvious on the screen. The greatest example of this is 'AVATAR' but all film really is the most collaborative art form there is and therefor, in my opinion, the most impressive one. You've got to admire the heart that goes into making these movies and it's especially obvious in films like this.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYbw_OZUFso",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Toy Story 3,"The hardest part of donating your toys to charity is the knowledge that some less-fortunate kid will now be playing with your favourite nipple clamps.Oops! Apparently, you're not supposed to donate sex toys to charity. Furthermore, the toys in this Pixar animated picture are not being donated to charity, nor were they purchased at a XXX store.When their owner is packing for college, Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear, (Tim Allen) and the rest of the toys are mistakenly dropped off at a daycare where they not only have to cope with unruly preschoolers, but also a posse of perturbed playthings led by a tyrannical teddy bear (Ned Beatty).Constructed with the same care, clowning, and craftsmanship as its predecessors, Toy Story 3 will amuse both mature and immature fans alike.And while giving up your toys is tough, as an adult you finally get to play with matches. (Green Light)",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Toy Story 3,Heart warming and funny, definitely a classic","The plot summary goes something like this. Andy is going off to college and is no longer interesting in playing with toys. He chooses to take Woody (voice of Tom Hanks) with him and leaves Buzz Lightyear (voice of Tim Allen), Jessie (voice of Joan Cusack), Mr. Potato Head (voice of Don Rickles), Mrs. Potato Head (voice of Estelle Harris), Rex (voice of Wallace Shawn), Barbie (voice of Jodie Benson), Aliens (voice of Jeff Pidgeon, Hamm (voice of John Ratzenberger), Slinky Dog (voice of Blake Clark), and Bullseye (non speaking) behind to be put in the attic. The attic toys mistakenly wind up going to a local daycare. They are thrilled about the move, because they are under the impression that Andy doesn't want them because of the mistaken voyage. But soon they find out it is not always greener on the other side. They are constantly abused by the younger children and they are soon under the power of the great Lotso (voice of Ned Beatty and his right hand man Ken (voice of Michael Keaton), followed by the giant, freakish, lazy eyed, non speaking toddler. They find themselves being held prisoner there and Woody must come to their rescue. Woody and the gang must race against time to free themselves from the evil Lotso and crew so that they can get home before Andy leaves for college.The theme for Toy Story 3 is things aren't always what they seem and that you shouldn't jump to conclusions. Love is unconditional! Not that Andy is going away to college and the toys start feeling like they are useless, they find themselves having a hard time dealing with what they knew to be inevitable the whole time. They knew there would come a day where Andy would grow up and leave home and then they would be thrown out or store away somewhere. Woody was not pleased with what reality had in store for him but as a faithful toy he knew what he had to do. Andy's other toys (Buzzlightyear, Jessie, and Mr. & Mrs. Potato Head, Rex, Aliens, Hamm, Slinky Dog, Bullseye) and new member Barbie (Andy's sister's old toy) think that Andy doesn't care about them anymore and they want to move on. They are not content with being some old used toy that is going to wait around for Andy. They want to be loved and played with. They would not be happy just sitting in the attic to just be thrown out one day. They end up accidentally getting tossed into the garbage. They don't realize this is an accident and soon find them eager to be taken to a nearby orphanage to get dropped off. Woody tells them over and over again that it is all a mistake and that Andy loves them. Jessie insists that they are not loved and are looking forward to going to the day care. They realize that Woody was right and now they may never see Andy again.Another example of theme would be once they get to the daycare; the kids are mean and play rough with them. There so called new friends that they meet there turn on them and things are way worse than they ever imagined. They knew that they should have listened to Woody and they wouldn't have been in this mess. They should have also trusted in their long time friend Andy.I think that the lighting and angles of subjective view of the characters through the majority of the movie kept you involved and made you really feel what the characters felt. It heightened emotion and as embarrassing as it is to say that I cried over an animated movie, I must admit it. The dialogue and lighting used on the scene where Andy and his mother say their goodbyes and he assures her that he will always be with her no matter where they are in the world was really touching.This movie is by far the best of all the other Toy Story movies and from my understanding may be the last. I strongly suggest you go see this movie. It has a good story line and is filled with suspense, action, drama, adult humor as well as all around humor, sadness and real life lessons. It is an all around great movie for any age and is terrific for families. It is also definitely worth the money to see it in the theater. I didn't see it in 3D because it was not an option and I hate wearing those glasses. I do think it is available in some places. Big thumbs up on this one!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Good, but nothing really special","I have noticed that Pixar's films have amassed legions of fans, even though they are supremely mediocre. Maybe that's why they are so popular: mass appeal means mediocrity. The best stuff is generally not the stuff that appeals to everyone, to appeal to everyone is to make something that everyone enjoys and understands, but given that people are different, it means that you must make something that doesn't impress an individual as much as it could, as to impress the greatest number of people.Take this film for instance, it is a decent film, it entertains, but it is not a masterpiece by any means and is full of flaws: This film is filled with clichés and forced emotions (melodrama). These flaws are typical of Hollywood blockbusters and they reinforce the mediocrity of the film. Though, the film manages to execute these clichés well enough to be a good film, but expect nothing special.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
I went with low expectations and still got disappointed.,I was never a fan of toy story franchise. All these movies have amazing concept but the execution is always extremely creepy. Those toys frightens me.,3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Toy Story 3 is pure genius,"Like everyone else, I would have to say ""Pixar has done it again!"" ""Toy Story 3,"" the SECOND sequel to Pixar's most famous work, ""Toy Story,"" does what most second-sequels would love do – live up to standards of the previous films! ""Toy Story 3″ heightens the emotion and the especially the danger from the previous two films. ""Toy Story 3″ is included in the ""Must-Watch"" film category – I'm sure of that. ""Toy Story 3″ is one of those films where you know it'll be worth watching, and where you know it'll live up to the hype. ""The Dark Knight"" was the ""must-watch"" film of 2008, ""Up,"" ""Avatar,"" and ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,"" were the ""must-watch"" films of 2009 (although ""Up"" was the only one that lived up to its hype), and now ""Toy Story 3″ is the ""must- watch"" film of 2010!""Toy Story 3″ opens with a beautiful and creative scene, seen through the eyes of Andy. The opening shows us Andy's imagination and what he sees and thinks of as he plays with his beloved toys. After this amazing scene, the film goes through a short montage of Andy playing with his toys in the past. But then we realize that a long time has passed, and Andy hasn't played with the toys in years. When the film skips to present day, we find out that some of the toys from the previous two films are gone – they've either been donated or sold at yard sales. Learning this fact was sad to me, and most likely every other fan of the series, for all of the toys are a part of our past, and no longer seeing them is just depressing.Through a series of mishaps, all of the main toys end up at a daycare center, called Sunnyside Daycare. Of course, a daycare seems like heaven for a bunch of toys since dozens of kids are there to play with them 5 days a week. When the toys first arrive at Sunnyside, we meet some of the main players at the daycare, including the Barbie-doll Ken, and the leader of Sunnyside, Lotso the lovable hugging bear! Of course, all of this seems too good to be true, and it is. Andy's toys received the bad end of the stick, for when they arrived at Sunnyside, they became the new toys for the youngest age group at the daycare. When Andy's toys asked to be moved to the older kids' room, we learn how Sunnyside is really run.Then comes the part where the film turns into a prison-break movie. While Andy's toys are at Sunnyside and running into trouble, Woody is instead at one of the daycare kids' home, meeting a few more new toys, including a doll, unicorn, porcupine, triceratops, and peas-in-a-pod. When Woody meets another toy there, Chuckles the Clown, he learns of Sunnyside's true nature and of Lotso's dark past. Woody decides to go back to the daycare in order to help his fellow toys escape.From that point on, the adventure truly begins. The feel of the movie turns dark and edgy, and it feels like another movie. It's amazing how the filmmakers made the daycare look a lot like a real Alcatraz-like prison at night. Andy's toys go through an elaborate escape plan, only to end up at gigantic trash dump, which is the most epic part of the movie. The third act, the last 20 or so minutes, is where the toys face their greatest threat yet, and are the closest to actual death. And the third act is the point where the tears come in.""Toy Story 3″ has the most dramatic and emotional scene in the series because of its third act, and the third act has two different emotional scenes, though I felt the first (the incinerator scene) was more effective. The ending of the movie is the second half, and is more optimistic and happy than sad to me, even though it is pretty sad – it's the good kind of sad.The incinerator scene was the best part of the movie for me. The music was just perfect for the scene, and was in-sync with what was happening on screen. As the toys gave up and finally accepted their fate, they all held hands as the music was dramatic (the ""dun-dun"" part of the music at that scene was perfectly timed, and it added to the emotional effect of the scene). It was just one of the most emotional, dramatic scenes in any of the Pixar films. I truly felt scared – scared for the toys – and my heart was pumping quickly! The incinerator scene is definitely the most memorable part to me. The last-play-time scene was emotional, too, because we see for the last time how much Andy and his toys love one another, and how much history they've had.The adventure in ""Toy Story 3″ was a great one. I'm grateful that Pixar allowed us to grow up with these characters and this series. The ""Toy Story"" trilogy was a joyful, heartfelt experience that will definitely never be forgotten. ""Toy story 3″ gave the series the perfect ending – I honestly didn't predict that the fate of the toys would be like the one ""Toy Story 3″ actually gave us for its ending. It's sad to see the series end, but like Andy, it's time to move on, but the memories will always be with us.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
An amazing part of my childhood comes to an end,"I was 6 years old when the first Toy Story came out and I remember it so clearly because I automatically fell in love. The story, the characters, the dialogue, the animation, all had me enthralled. I was about 10 when Toy Story two came out, following many disappointing sequels from Disney. It surpassed any expectation I had, bringing a new adventure to my beloved characters and staying loyal to the original.Toy Story 3 is just as loyal but still manages enough change and originality that you get sucked in once again, loving every minute. Now, at 20 years of age, I once again found myself caught up in the story of the characters I grew up with. It was crazy to be in the theater with all these young kids that didn't have quite the same sentimental value attached to the show. They loved it but the novelty of it wasn't there for them. Toy Story was the first of it's kind when I saw it and I found myself trying to keep from crying at a couple moments near the end not just because the movie itself was moving but because it was the end of something so great. And I don't tear up that easily :)i thought it ended on the perfect bittersweet note. As the plot began to unfold, I was a bit worried that the ending would be hard to accept but with a short time left I realized that Pixar had figured out an ending that would satisfy anyone. In short, I loved it. There is nothing that disappointed me in any way.Thanks for this wonderful trilogy Pixar!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
My heart! :(,"Wow is the first word that comes to my head. How does Pixar do it?This sweet, little, adorable film has completely stolen my heart and broken it at the same time. I've always loved Toy story one and two, but I was skeptical of the third. Really, how can Pixar pull off making a third Toy Story, that we're all going to love as much as the first and the second? Well, I don't know how they blew us away but they did, and we possibly loved it more.The film shows the toys encountering some serious challenges, there is a deep sense of love and camaraderie which is so heart warming, no hope is lost.It is a film for children to laugh at because they love the characters, but the clever part is that the adults understand it on a deeper level. We feel the emotional side of the story in a way that children simply will not understand until they're adults. Both demographics are successfully reached.Toy Story 3 is hilarious, ever so cute and intensely action filled. The dialogue and emotions are expressed so profoundly that we feel the struggles and desires of the characters as if they are our own. So effective, that it took me four days to stop feeling sad about it.A beautiful compelling story of love, strength, fear, friendship, and the courage to accept what we cannot change.Gorgeous movie.

Wow! They've done it again.,"As a grown man the original Toy Story has always made it on on my personal Top 10 list. Our 2 kids, now teenagers, have grown up watching Toy Story as well, and it is great to see them admire and love them all, as they grow they seem to appreciate them even more and more, perhaps as they reflect on their own childhood. When Toy Story 2 came out, my own expectations were that it would probably be an okay, possibly good sequel, but it would never quite match the original. I was wrong - it was as good as the original. Toy Story 3 is the first film I have seen in this new era 3D (Imax 3D to be precise), so perhaps that has given it an extra little edge, but I was once again completely blown away by the rehash of the characters, the narrative, the fabulous story and imaginative script. It has comedy, drama, romance, thrilling frightening moments, real tear jerking stuff. Wow! They've pulled it off once again.

What does this have to do with the lovely Toy Story 1 & 2 at all?",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pixar at their best!,"The minute I saw the trailer for Toy story 3 I was blown away and it brought back so many memories that the past year has been just waiting anxiously for it to come out. Then the movies came out on blu-ray, what better way to prepare for this amazing adventure that Pixar gave us. I have to say, when I saw Wall-E I was just surprised to see how they could get people of all ages to get so emotional with such unusual characters. That lovely robot that changed the fate of mankind and had us laughing for quite a while, to that 80 year old grumpy man. By the way, with Up, they made people fall in love with a character within 10 minutes. I think some people don't realize that for some movies, it takes the writers 2 hours to make people identify with the characters. Without doubt, The Pixar people know that when they are making a movie, they are making THE movie of the year. I grew up with Toy story, as many other reviewers here. I still laugh with the same movies and still get my heart a LITTLE broken every time I see that part in the first Toy Story with the song ""I Will Go Sailing No More"". The night I went to watch this movie I was with a few friends from the US (I'm from Mexico and we only get the dubbed version which is pretty awesome too, and I don't generally like dubbed movies). Their Spanish is not great so some parts were a little hard for them to understand. It was not necessary for them to get every single line, and I think it made them focus on the expressions of the toys, the music, the lighting and they too were crying as well as most people in the room, I can't wait for them to watch it in English and then watch it with a completely different perspective. Although it is a movie for kids, it is the darker of the three, the second time I saw it I was with a couple of little kids and they were really scared in some parts. Ever since Wall-E I came to realize how universal their movies are, so little dialogue, so many emotions. I guess this is probably not a great review of the movie, it is more like the experience you are probably gonna get. It's a movie in which you will laugh, cry, get scared, angry and who knows how many other things. So many life lessons that about friendship and love. I felt like I was 8 years old again, nothing mattered but the great stories I made up with all my toys, I didn't want to grow up (I still think some part of me didn't and that is why I enjoy this movies so much), but somehow, this movie showed a different side of the script and story that you don't get when you are a kid. **SPOILER for Finding Nemo** It was like that part in Finding Nemo when they are hanging to the whales tongue and Dory says: It's time to let go! Marlin: How do you know, how do you know something bad isn't gonna happen?! Dory: I don't! A kid would just probably get plain lines without special meaning. Just ask a parent if they got the same simple lines. Dreamworks' Shrek made the same thing with adult jokes. Don't get me wrong, Shrek is a great movie, I guess if I had to choose to watch a movie over and over again between these two...

"Don't let the ""3"" in the title worry you in the slightest. This is such an approachable film for children and adults alike.","Because it had been 11 years since we last saw Woody and Buzz on the big screen and the first two films were so awesome, this was to be the runt of the trilogy. Probably good entertainment for two hours but obviously a ploy by Pixar to squeeze as much money possible from their most beloved franchise while they still could. Now that I've seen Toy Story 3 I'm both happy and humbled to report that I was wrong.Like Toy Story 2, Toy Story 3 begins with a bang. Those who remember how the first two Toy Story movies begin should be able to tell immediately what's going on. After a little bit of fun lighthearted drama, we see a series of flashbacks through old videos and images of Andy playing with his toys through the years. We see that gradually he's growing up and when the camera ends and darkness comes we are brought to the present day. He is now 17 and about to go to college. Andy has outgrown his toys and while they have gotten used to staying in boxes they still desperately yearn for any kind of attention from him. Even being held briefly by him is now a moment to be cherished. These are bleak times for the toys and Woody, the unofficial leader of the group, tries to keep everyone's spirits up by clinging to any type of positive thinking that can be mustered. Only a handful of the toys from the first two films are still with Andy (many of them have been sold at yard sales and others donated). Despite being ignored, they still have a loyalty to Andy because he's kept them and are content with staying in the attic if that's what he wants. Woody points out that someday Andy might have kids and they might get played with again. However, a misunderstanding convinces all of them (save Woody) that Andy no longer wants them and they seek to be donated to the local daycare center. At Sunny Side day care center, these ""NEW TOYS!"" are pleased with their first impressions of everything. The toys seem nice. The kids seem nice. And the idea of not having an owner appeals to them. However, first impressions can be misleading...That's all of the plot I'm willing to reveal. Let me say that this is easily my favorite Pixar movie since the original Toy Story in 1995. It made me laugh which is not always easy. Ken is a welcome addition to the Toy Story family and, alongside Barbie, share many of the most memorable scenes in the movie. And Spanish speaking Buzz is even funnier than I could have imagined from the commercials.The villain of this movie is in some respects the most evil of all the Toy Story villains like Sid, Sid's dog, Al the toy collector, Stinky Pete, and even evil emperor Zerg! And towards the end there is one particular moment where his wickedness is fully revealed. Who knew that such evil could be in the form of a teddy bear that smells like strawberries! For a movie that took over a decade to get to the screen, it's amazing how relevant and integral it is to this trilogy. In retrospect it even kind of seems like Toy Story and Toy Story 2 were mere stepping stones to this movie where the big questions about children's relationship with toys would finally be tackled.Toy Story 3, in contrast to what a lot of critics suggest, won't make everyone cry. It won't even make most people cry. But it's guaranteed to melt the coldest hearts, make the sternest face smile, and, yes, make a few people sob. The ending was, for me, the best ending to a Pixar movie (even though it was borderline cheesy) and is probably my favorite ending to any movie since Shawshank Redemption's ending. Many people will say they were sad but I was happy because I knew it had to happen. The ending also makes this trilogy complete and, though a Toy Story 4 is not impossible, it seemed like the creators were saying to the audience that this is the final curtain call. Of course, if this movie makes a lot of money the executives might reconsider but for the moment I don't think there are any plans to do a ""4"".And if the day ever comes when they decide to go back into the attic and dust off these old toys for one more adventure, I'll be lining up to see it and expect nothing less than an awesome movie. If you haven't seen this movie, stop reading these reviews and go see it right now.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Toy Story 3: The best one of all,"It's hard to believe it's been 15 years since Toy Story came out in theaters, you look at it now it feels like today. Toy Story was the first pixar animated film. Characters we grow to love, Woody(Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear(Tim Allen), Mr and Mrs Potato Head(Don Rickeles and Estelle Harris), Rexx(Wallace Shawn), Hamm(John Ratzenberger), and Slinky Dogg(Jim Varney). And a sequel followed four years later, and it proved to be a bigger hit than part 1, and we were introduced to Jessi(Joan Cusack). The ending of part 2 left you wondering,will there be a Toy Story 3, well 11 years later you finally got that answer.Andy is 18 years old, and is going off to college, and wants to take Woody with him, but he puts the other toys in a box, and attempts to put them in the basement, But Buzz and the gang are mistaken for trash, Woody tries to come to there rescue, they find themselves at a children's nursery called Sunnydale, they meet Ken doll(Michael Keaton), and others, the leader Lotto(Ned Beatty) a purple bear. Will this be good for them or not?I liked this one, it puts one up on part 2, it's more adventurous. Sadly Jim Varney(Slinky Dog) passed away in 2000, so actor Blake Clarke takes over for him and they sound almost alike. Michael Keaton steals a few scenes as the voice of Ken. The animation is a thousand times better than ever. Please don't miss it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Great conclusion, NOT a great movie, but entertaining still","Toys haven't come alive on the big screen in over ten years, which means that Toy Story 3 when it comes, comes with presentation, and promise, but is it a great movie.....no, just a good one.The problem is not so much that the Disney/pixar crew fail to rejuvenate the life of their toys after ten years, the problem is that frankly, the movie doesn't feel all that clever. It is funny to be sure, but it falls into a couple of unprofessional traps.The first problem is that Toy Story 3 feels unconvincingly plotted. Not only is it contrived but it doesn't feel like there is much story here. Andy is leaving for college, and plans to put all his toys away in the attic, but in a strange mix up, they end up in the garbage, and through another mix up, they end up in a day care centre full of destructive toddlers. They plan to escape, but it's not so easy, considering some of the larger toys led by a big Strawberry odoured bear, are running the place like a jail, and they DON'T like new toys.Another problem in Toy Story 3, which is actually typical of a lot of Disney's recent works, is that the studio is no longer able to characterize villains. The likes of extravagant figures such as Jaffar, Scar, Cruella Deville, do not exist anymore. Disney villains today are all manufactured like Toys, equipped with nothing but a sour face, and a stupid motive. My one problem with WALL-E was that Auto (the villain) was arguably Disney's worst, but the Teddy here is a close second.So if Toy Story 3 fails, then where does it succeed....well it's funny I'll say that much, not as funny as the second, but funny. Mr Potato head, finds a new body in a cucumber, Woody flies a kite (or rather the kite flies him) Buzz gets a reprogramming which allows him to tango romantically. Jesse was the only character who I don't think was given enough to do. Her primary function is to be a love interest for Buzz, but the plot doesn't ever choose to embrace that, so instead she is sort of left tangling by her pull string.As a conclusion to a trilogy, Toy Story 3 works just fine I think. It uses a device that feels credible and heart warming, and to a degree thematically enriching. This movie is supposed to be about the coming of age, but the ending is where it really delivers this. What would have been better is if the whole movie could deliver it, Toy Story 3 feels a bit over rated. It's funny enough, but it's not enriching enough, and comes across as more a product designed with the intention of making as much money as possible rather than a movie into which some of cinema's best animators can put their heart and soul into. As a money maker, Toy Story certainly gets an A+ but as a movie, I can only give it a B, still worth seeing though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The story continues,"I watched ""Toy Story 3"" not long after the very disappointing, played out ""Shrek 4"" (sound like a football score) so my hopes weren't high and indeed, half an hour in thought that I was in for a marshmallowy cloying tale with no thrills drama or edge to it. I should have known better of course and even if said thrills drama and edge not unnaturally lacked something in terms of originality, still a satisfying conclusion was delivered with plenty of fun along the way.Pixar has totally taken ownership of the Disney mantle of purveying animated features that appeal on a basic level to children and the child in adults, intuitively tapping into the latter's fading memories of our own childhoods, never more so in the opening scenes where the toys play out a fully-realised fantasy adventure in the mind of the child in the movie and by extension, the child in us before reality intrudes.The rest is pretty formulaic with the customary themes of nostalgia, family ties and loyalty reworked, taking in neat comic vignettes on the whole Ken and Barbie relationship, just how destructive and anarchic a children's play-group can actually be and a homage to Latin lovers everywhere when Buzz's controls are reset to (Spanish) factory settings. As ever there are more than enough knowing lines inserted for grown-up consumption, my favourite hidden-away gem being John Ratzenberger's Cliff from ""Cheers"" retort of ""negatory"", but there are a fair sprinkling of other comedic nuggets, while the sequence of Ken modelling his entire wardrobe is surely destined for classic status.Of course, the movie assumes a universality of remembrance for an American child's infant years which can never resonate wholly with everyone, but nevertheless ""Toy Story 3"" maintains the high standard of its predecessors with its winning combination of great animation, subtle characterisation, action adventure and that magic ingredient of childhood evocation to which we can surely all relate.Can't see where a further sequel can arise however from the dead-end into which the writers have painted themselves, but I guess I thought that about James bond and Star. Trek too...",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Not suitable for children, it's like a horror film with toys","Honestly, this film can give kids nightmares. There are very scary characters in the film, and very tensed moments, which can evoke anxiety in your children.

Toy Story 3 is Pixar's best movie to date!,"Toy Story 3 was my most anticipated movie of the year. I have loved Toy Story since its original release. Toy Story 3 surpasses all of my expectations and stays true to what makes these movies great, they make you feel like a kid again. This movie is considerably darker than the previous two but not in a bad way. The whole movie put you on an emotional roller-coaster filled with laughter and tears. Some scenes are genuinely intense and might frighten younger children. When watching this movie you can tell that it was written for an older audience but kids will definitely enjoy it too.I won't talk about the story because most people know what this movie is about, but the trailer doesn't give anything away. There are plenty of surprises in Toy Story 3. It has been 11 years since we've seen a new Toy Story and Pixar has created a movie that feels like we haven't been without these characters for this long, the viewer still cares about these characters and what happens to them throughout the story. I'd say that this movie has the best storyline out of the trilogy and has a story that will always be relevant.The animation is incredible. Pixar always pays careful attention to detail and it definitely shows in this movie. All of the animation moves flawlessly and how you would think these toys would move in real life.The humor, as in every Pixar movie, is enjoyable for both kids and adults. There are jokes that kids will laugh at and subtle jokes that adults will understand but told in a way that kids will still laugh. In my opinion, this is the funniest Toy Story to date.I highly recommend seeing Toy Story 3 as soon as you can. This is by far my favorite movie of the year and maybe even of the last couple of years. It will be tough for any movie this year to be better than Toy Story 3. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Great movie for both parents and kids,"Yesterday I saw this movie for the second time. It was even more fun than the first time, because with the speed of this movie you seem to miss a lot of subtle details. I am surprised that some people think that this is not a movie for kids. My kids are 9, 12 and 16 years young and they loved it. It has enough in the story to talk about. The details are breathtaking and I don't know why people always want to see new things. John Wayne also played his role over and over again, but still is one of the main movie icons of all all time. I think that Woody is a great competition to become the animated counterpart of Mr. Wayne. Go and see this movie and just enjoy it. It is quality time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The Perfect Trilogy,"Toy Story 3 had BIG shoes to fill upon its release. The first two Toy Story films were incredible, but I never had any doubts about Toy Story 3 being just as good, and I wasn't disappointed, it was incredible.I went to watch the film with a group of friends in its opening week, and we watched the 3D version. The 3D was impeccable, but watching the film in 3D was just a bonus, Toy Story 3 was something i'd been waiting 11 years for.In the film, we see a 17 year old Andy going to college and moving on, but his toys are thrown away by mistake and they end up in a box donated to Sunnyside daycare. Upon there arrival, the toys are impressed by the daycare centre and the other toys that they meet there, but Woody is intent on going back to Andy, insisting that he still wants the other toys, but they find the daycare centre as a paradise, and so Woody leaves alone, only to be found and taken home by a little girl named Bonnie. Meanwhile, Buzz and the gang discover daycare isn't as pleasant as it seems, when the toys are put in with the toddlers. Woody begins to see the bright side of having a new owner like Bonnie, but discovers the truth about the daycare centre and so sets out to rescue his friends.The plot becomes rapidly intense, full of twists and turns. In many ways, Toy Story 3 is different to its predecessors, but in a positive way. The film certainly has plenty of action, and also very emotional, especially the scene where the toys decide their fate and join hands ready to be destroyed.Overall, I wasn't let down in the slightest by Toy Story 3 and in my opinion, it was just as good as the previous films. The perfect end to a perfect trilogy.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The most dramatic of the three Toy Story films,"Toy Story 3 is definitely the most dramatic of the three Toy Story films.

"Cute, Fun-Filled and A lot of Heart. Toy Story 3 is Golden.","We have all seen Pixar's work before and cherished it for many years of our lives.We saw our favorite toy friends in Toy Story 1-2, Took a deeper look into a world of Monsters in Monsters Inc, That A Bug's Life is more of a adventure, Diving into a under-sea adventure in Finding Nemo, Feasting on the fantasy tale of Ratatouille, Having an Incredible time with The Incredibles, Riding through the ride of our life in Cars, Learning about Space and Love in WALL-E and reaching for the skies in Up.And don't forget the little films we see, Pixar is now far superior then any other movie company to exist, with this much work there is no way that they have their best work yet. Well, now their best work is here... TOY STORY 3!! Seeing this film in 3D is such a 2hr delight, especially seeing more characters is fun to look at, such as Lots-o-Hugs Bear, Chatter Telephone, Strech and Ken.This second sequel improves itself that Toy Story still captures us all with its charm and enjoyable moments that we still adore today.Hands Down, Best Pixars Work since the very first or second.

The best of the toy stories,"I have seen all four of the toy stories and this is by far the best. The other ones are either ok or kind of meh. But this I actually like. This movie has the most meaning out of all of them I feel like. Tells you that change is ok and to move on from the past, and that is kind of a message most movies don't really use. And the flashbacks with the bear and the clown and doll are actually kind of sad.

Very dark.,"Be careful! This is not for little kids. If I had watched it when I was very little (4-6), I would have had nightmares. It is depressing as well as scary and gets scarier with every minute. It builds a feeling of doom and despair using everything possible - music, visuals, plot filled with betrayal and violence..

Playground,"First things first: This is hands down the best 3-D picture I have seen to this day (that's towards the end of 2010). And I have seen quite a few 3-D pictures! From Horror (Valentine, Final Destination) to Fantasy (Journey to...) and animation (Shrek 4). Ice Age (3-D) was almost equally enjoyable (for me), but Toy Story 3(-D) is just top notch!And all comes down to the fact, that you have a movie at the core. A story that will move you, a ride that will take you with it. And it works even if you have never heard of the characters before (or seen them for that matter). Of course there are a few inside jokes, that you will only get if you have seen the prior entries into the series (another but not the only reason to check out the other Toy Story movies).It's difficult to put your finger into, why Pixar is able to make movies for adults and children alike, that have a high quality too. It is not a coincidence, that Pixar waited until they had their story for the part 3, before they went ahead to make it. If rumors are true of some other story ideas (Disney almost developed the third part), than you can only be glad, they waited and made it just now.The story is so rich and the movie was one of the few times, I actually went to the cinemas a second time, to watch it again. I can only say: Thank you Pixar!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Surprised me that it still is as good as the first and second,"Usually I think Disney goes too far with making more than 2 films such as the Shrek or Ice Age. After a while I don't see the point of remaking cartoons after several years because there's nothing new to bring delight to something after so many remakes or editions, just my opinion but it bores me. Toy Story 3 was not at all boring though, the laughs it brought me even as an adult now is crazy to imagine or even admit, but I would recommend the 3 of these films to any family.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Toy Story 3.,"Here's a wonderful completion to Pixar's flagship. The film does exactly what it aims to do and is strong enough on it's own to be recognized outside of the pack. However, the lying problems to me were two fold. The use of 3D hindered my enjoyment. The tool is useful when applied properly and perhaps for limited viewing. But I couldn't help but feel a wall between me and the film. The final moments with Andy could have been richer for me without this distraction. I wanted to well up inside. I wanted to shed tears for a story a cared very deeply about, but I couldn't move past the awkwardness. Still, a great fitting end to a wonderful series.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
If only more movies could be made with this much care and skill.,"""Now you've got to promise to take good care of these guys. They...mean a lot to me.""If this is goodbye to the Toy Story franchise, then it's a fond farewell. There's not much question of whether fans of the previous two movies will like it, or movie fans of any age. The story is amazing, humorous, thrilling, and bittersweet. There's more adventure, heart, and soul in this ""kids"" movie than in anything else you're likely to see anytime soon. And if you don't find yourself getting a little emotional at certain points in the story, you're made of sterner stuff than I. It's pretty obvious that this was a labor of love on Pixar's part, and the result is their best movie so far.It's also one of the most visually astounding computer animated films that I've seen. Especially on Blu-Ray. The colors are vivid, everything has brilliant sharpness and clarity, and the level of detail in every toy, human, and background element never ceases to amaze. Toy Story 3 is just utterly beautiful. Not just from a technical standpoint, but as an achievement in artistic style that elevates it to the levels of visual appeal that had until this point been reached only by traditionally animated movies like Spirited Away and a few others.I know that no movie has been (or ever will be) loved by absolutely everyone. But Toy Story 3 is as worthy of approaching that mark as any other movie I've seen. It's guaranteed to get some kind of genuine response from 99% of those watch it: be it a tear, a cheer, or just a big smile. See it. See it with your kids, your significant other, your friends, or just by yourself. You won't regret it.Goodbye Buzz. Goodbye Woody. Goodbye Andy.

What a Blast From the Past,"Toy Story 3 is quite an experience. If you're like me, you have watched the Toy Story movies as a child. So, it was a little weird going to see the third movie in the theater all grown up. Even though it was not worth seeing in 3D, it was still an amazing movie with a fantastic storyline.I was very surprised on how much this movie made me laugh. I am not one to laugh at comedy that is made for children, but this movie has succeeded plenty of times. It is one of the few movies I can say that all ages can enjoy, and even if you are not a big fan of family films, you still might enjoy it.The whole Plot of the story is that Andy, the child from the previous movies who played with the toys, is all grown up, and is going to college. The toys are put in a day care center, and they have to start their new life there. I was surprised when this plot occurred, as it was more creative than I expected.What truly makes this movie fantastic is the great voice acting and new characters. The voice acting is outstanding to say the least, and the new characters all have personalities that fit their toy figure. To see such a huge new variety of cast, its fair to expect disaster. But, Pixar did a fantastic job, and the story keeps almost all characters in the story and have their own place in the plot.Toy Story 3 is not a perfect movie, though. The storyline reaches a couple of dull spots where I lost interest, and the ending was not too satisfying. I don't want to ruin anything, but you will see what I mean. It just seems the story shifts what the characters want.Overall, Toy Story 3 is a fantastic family film, and I know kids will enjoy it, and adults might even enjoy it more. This is near the top of the best summer movies of 2010, and for great reasons. Although not perfect, it is definitely worth seeing in the theaters.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Day (S)Care Center,"Woody et al. are back for a final(?) installment in the immensely popular Toy Story franchise.While not up to the original's technical and narrative impact fifteen years ago, this pic's an improvement on the second part. The day care center dictatorship offers a welcome sinister subtext, that was missing in part two, and the by now well-embraced characters are still able to carry enough emotional heft. And technically, this one's a marvel to behold.Unfortunately, the emotional moments - the ending in particular - are not as effective as they ought to be, and the story's structure is all too similar to its predecessor's.Still, a fitting swan song to the trilogy.7 out of 10 Ken and Barbie love stories",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Best part in trilogy, best (animation) film of last years","I'll go straight on this: I didn't really like the second part of ""Toy Story"". Not that it was a bad movie, but in my opinion it had weak story. The problem portrayed in it was unimpressive and plot details often appeared far-fetched. It was just like ordinary second part of something, the thing which doesn't aim to deliver something new, but just to bring something old and present it again in a slightly new manner for an amazing and good time.But when I've watched the third part I realized this was a completely another approach. How surprised I was to see the same team that created Toy Story 2 to change their ""set problem->get adventure"" algorithm to a something deeper and metaphorical, something that while being portrayed in toys can be easily seen in us, humans! This valuable ability of a movie about toys was there, in the first part, was almost ignored in the second part, and blossomed into brilliant drama in the third part.Besides the drama, Toy story 3 still preserves its style of breathtaking adventure and wonderful humor. The things that are equally appealing to children and adults. And this is another wonderful notice about this film - you will have real fun while watching it, and yet have the things to think about when it ends.It was hard for me not to cry at the end.

The best of the series in one of the best trilogies of all-time.,"11 years of waiting for a third and it was worth the damn wait.

Randy Newman is back as the composer and gives another Oscar-worthy score. Toy Story 3 from the beginning to the end has very clever storytelling (they better win for screenplay at the Oscars next year), laughs, tears & action thanks to Pixar as is the case with them. This movie is amazing, mix with lots of laughs & tears. The ending will make you cry even if you don't want to, it will make you cry.

From Tom Hanks and Tim Allen right down to Jodi Benson the voice cast is strong and the script is filled with the same heart and humour that made the first two films in the series so loved.The final scene is the perfect way to end the film and the series.

Wow!,"I'm only 16 and like most other people my age, I grew up watching Toy Story 1 & 2, and when I heard that they were going to make a 3rd Toy Story film I'll be honest, I wasn't actually that excited I was a little disappointed in fact because I thought they would go and ruin a great film franchise by making another film just to make money just like they did with the Godfather series. That said I still went to see it because there is obviously no better place to watch a film than in the cinema I didn't want to miss the opportunity. I was quite simply amazed and I can't understand why I ever thought Toy Story 3 might not be that good.When I walked into the screening room it was virtually packed of people of all ages; there were people my age, parents with their kids and even adults without kids in there which proves anyone of any can enjoy Toy Story and the best part was that when the credits rolled and they were showing the extra clips at the end of the movie virtually the whole audience remained in their seats to watch the final clips which I guess shows how much they all enjoyed it.To those who haven't seen the movie yet you definitely should, no question. You've probably also heard that this movie is very sad if you haven't seen it yet, and that's true it is sad at times but it's also very funny at others and I even found it thrilling in some parts as well.

Best Movie Ever!,"""You've got a friend in me,"" go the lyrics to the Randy Newman tune that has been crooned in all of Pixar's magical Toy Story films, including the brand-new Toy Story 3. It's a catchy little ditty, and it might even trick you into thinking the films are about friendship. But you'd be wrong.Despite the buddy-action trappings that made it seem like Woody and Buzz were starring in plastic-plaything spins on 48 Hrs. or Lethal Weapon, the Toy Storys have always been about the emotional Tilt-a-Whirl that is love—and more specifically, about family love. The 1995 original was a tale of sibling rivalry, with Woody (Tom Hanks) learning to make peace with the ""new baby""—Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen)—stealing his owner Andy's attention; 1999's Toy Story 2 pondered the risks and rewards of opening up to intimate connection. And this time around—in yet another Pixar triumph of profoundly felt storytelling—it's time to talk about letting go.Of course, because these guys are too sneaky just to serve up the vegetables of a moral, they wrap it in irresistible cotton candy. The 11 years since Toy Story 2 have passed almost in real time, with a now-17-year-old Andy preparing to leave home for college. That's not great news for a bunch of childhood toys, with Woody, Buzz and company facing the prospect of either attic storage or donation to a day-care center. But while a sentimental Andy intends the former, a mix-up finds the toys barely escaping the garbage and on their way to Sunnyside Day Care.At first, it seems like the gang has lucked out. The de facto leader of the day-care center's toys, a strawberry-scented, stuffed Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear (Ned Beatty), welcomes them all warmly, and there will be kids to play with them for the first time in years. Then, the rampaging toddlers show upÑand a plan for escape starts to form.In typical Pixar form, the adventure elements from director Lee Unkrich are splendidly and inventively choreographed. Woody's solo dash from captivity is a snappy set piece, and the complex, Great Escape-type plan of those who eventually follow includes some hilarious moments, including Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) being forced to attach his features to a floppy flour tortilla. There are great new character additions like a foppish Ken doll (Michael Keaton), and a stuffed hedgehog named Mr. Pricklepants (Timothy Dalton) with serious thespian pretensions. There are also giddy details galore, like a Speak-n-Spell being turned into a casino game for the day-care toys' after-hours amusement, or the retro fashion show that allows Ken to show off his extensive wardrobe (including a Nehru jacket!).But this is also a Toy Story with a unique sense of the passage of time, subtly suggested by the casting of John Morris—who voiced the young Andy in both earlier Toy Story installments as a child—to again play the role as an adult. A generation has grown up with these characters—Hamm (John Ratzenberger), Jessie (Joan Cusack), Rex (Wallace Shawn), Slinky Dog (Blake Clark, replacing the late Jim Varney)—and we might think of them as family. But in Toy Story 3, we also see them thinking of one another as family, facing the kind of complex decisions every family faces. When a climactic scene finds them linking hands during a crisis, it's one of the most genuinely lump-in-the-throat movie moments since ... well, probably since the last Pixar movie.It might seem at first glance that Toy Story 3 is merely riffing on the same aforementioned theme already nailed in Toy Story 2, including a montage that recalls the heartbreaking ""When She Loved Me"" sequence. In fact, Toy Story 3 is actually taking that concept—the risk and inherent pain in any intimate relationship—to an even more sophisticated level. As the final 20 minutes of the film play out, screenwriter Michael Arndt (Little Miss Sunshine) spins us through the wrenching landmark moments when family members need to say their goodbyes, and feel the ache of transitions. What continues to astonish about the Pixar films is the way they manage to pair blissful entertainment with the miraculous experience of being human—and in Toy Story 3, that includes the wonderful, awful, vertiginous experience of sharing a home, a history and a heart.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

They must have made it for monetary purposes, that's probably the only logical explanation. I didn't ask for this ""movie"" and neither did anyone else! It has a weak story, boring locations and a lazily edited soundtrack. As far as the storyline goes, it's one of the most cliched plots I have ever seen in an animated movie. I honestly predicted everything that happened throughout, including the ending! Which, I will not go into any details about, at the risk of spoiling it for those lucky souls who haven't had to sit through this ""movie"". Really, the ending is one I saw on the horizon since practically the beginning of the ""film"". In my head, I was thinking: ""yeah, didn't see that coming!"" Aside from the cliched layout, all of the jokes fall flat and I almost fell asleep multiple times! The locations, which I can't refer to them as sets since this is an animated film, are dull. Well, I suppose it matches the tone of the ""movie"" though, dull and boring! So they work, for all the wrong reasons. The soundtrack is okay in some scenes, but it adds nothing new or fresh to the plot. Once again, we have a soundtrack that sounds like it was added in at the last minute. Film Making 101: editing should be seamless. When you notice the editing, then something is very wrong. Now for the positives, yes, there are some positives I can salvage out of this ""movie"". The voice acting is spot-on and the animation is impeccable. All of the voice actors returned to voice their respectable characters, except for Jim Varney. Unfortunately, he died back in 2000, (R.I.P.) So, someone else had to do the voice of Slinky, that man is Blake Clark. Who honestly, did a fairly decent job. It did sound a little different, but overall, it was almost pitch-perfect. As for the rest of the cast, they all do a fantastic job with the voices without missing a beat. ""Toy Story 3"" is a major disappointment in the world of Pixar films. Is it their worst film? Absolutely not, there are a few that are worse. At the end of the day, I'm struggling to give ""Toy Story 3"" 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Just stick with ""Toy Story"" (1995) and ""Toy Story 2"" (1999) instead. Those are the real ""Toy Story"" films!",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
PHENOMENAL,"After re-watching this I was really surprised, I was coming in remembering liking toy story 2 more than this, and for the first 30 minutes I agreed with 7 year old me, but after the 30 minute mark toy story 3 Became one of the best Pixar movies (along with 2) but even better than 2. This movie is a masterpiece, and although its not as funny as the previous 2 movies, its thrilling action sequences and the ending definitely make it better than 1 and 2, even if it's not as funny.

"Not quite as fresh as its predecessors, but still funny and moving","The original 'Toy Story' was not only the world's first fully digitally animated feature, but also funny and original, the story of toys who just wanted to be played with, but who lived with the fear of redundancy and, in the case of Buzz Lightyear, an identity crisis (Buzz believing himself to be a real spaceman, and not just a toy). It played with the dual life every child ascribes to their toys, and brilliantly exploited its novel medium's ability to combine realism and fantasy. The sequel was pretty good as well. 'Toy Story 3' isn't bad either, although the idea is, inevitably, not quite as fresh in its third outing, the basic dynamic of the plot mirroring that of the two earlier films. There are still some fine moments: when Buzz gets stuck in his Spanish mode, the result is truly hilarious, and the scene in the furnace room more affecting than a story about talking toys has any right to be. The ending of the tale implies this is probably the final outing for these characters, and I think that's the right decision. But the series remains comparable in its quality to the best of Pixar's subsequent, much-admired work.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
So The Third In A Series Can Be Good?,"Andy is going off to college and is given the option of putting his toys in the attic or throwing them out. Through a series of unfortunate events, the toys actually end up being donated to Sunnyside Daycare. Which at first, seems like a wonderful place to be, but the truth about the place is soon discovered by the toys and they try to escape.In 1995 when Toy Story first hit the screens, I was around 7 or 8 years old. I am in disbelief at how young I was, 1995 doesn't seem that long ago, but it's been 15 years. I was still in elementary school when the second one came out too. I was young and was able to connect to both of the films, I saw a little of myself in Andy. I grew up playing with plastic army men, dinosaurs and cowboys. There is a special bond between a boy and his toys and Toy Story got it perfect. The original Toy Story introduced us to a few things. One was Pixar, a studio that would go on to create dozens of films that are entertaining and brilliant. Another was the first fully computer animated feature film. It changed the way animated films were made. Finally it gave us two of the most recognizable animated characters of all time, Woody and Buzz.Flashforward 11 years after Toy Story 2. I have recently graduated college and don't play with my toys anymore. Andy is heading off to college and he doesn't play with his toys anymore. The big question I had was, can a third entry to a series that is more than a decade old, still hold true to the original and will I still be able to connect to it? The answer is yes, on both accounts. Toy Story 3 is magical, entertaining and heartfelt. It reminded me of my childhood and my toys, the biggest thing this film has going for it is nostalgia. I found it funny that more than half the people in the audience were not alive when the first film came out.The constant fear of being discarded is present here, as it is in all three of the films. With this entry it is the forefront issue. The themes of loss, friendship and courage are all present in this third installment. Usually the third film in a franchise falls short of what the first two are, but this is not the case. Toy Story 3 is just as good as the first two. My minor complaint is that there is that one thing that is missing. It might be the 11 year gap between the films, but there is that little special thing that made me love the first two films that this one doesn't seem to have. Buzz seems a little underused as do the other toys, but this is a small issue that doesn't ruin a great film.There are 3 scenes in the film that made me almost cry. Hey, I said ALMOST. The first one is pretty early on, when Woody calls for a meeting, something we are accustomed to in the previous installments. But this time we don't see dozens of toys coming out from under the bed, behind closets or out of bins. It's just these guys. All the other toys that we see in the background are gone. Even though they were never the main characters, or given a lot of screen time, there was something about each one that we seemed to love. This people were a family and that family is broken. Wheezy, Bo Peep, Etch, RC, Lenny the Binoculars, Mike the tape recorder, Rocky Gibraltar the gladiator. Dozens of lovable background characters that made us love that room so much more.The other two scenes are near the end, one in which the toys join hands in fear of their ultimate doom. It's their realization of the end and their bonding together that got to me. The other is the final send off from Andy. The film builds on the previous adventures these characters had to tug on the heart strings. It never reaches the emotional depths of Up, but these are two totally different films. The way they chose to end the series, in my opinion was perfect and sad.There are hundreds of new characters, all introduced at the Daycare. At first you would seem to think that you will be overwhelmed with all the additional characters, but it is never an issue. The two most prominent new characters are Lotso Hugs and Ken, who is voiced by Batman himself. Some of the more interesting new characters are never given a chance to shine, they belong to Bonnie in her room, mainly my new favourite Mr. Pricklepants.The film mixes adventure, comedy and drama all perfectly. It's not as funny as the first two, but it is more adventurous. The animation doesn't call for anything fancy, these are toys after all, yet Pixar finds a way to still dazzle the eye. The climax of the film has a lot going on and it is edge of your seat entertainment.To end this review, I'll simply say the last thing Andy said before leaving the toys...""Thanks Guys""",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A fitting end to a perfect trilogy,"Pixar do not normally make sequels, with Toy Story being the only film that has had a sequel. Originally Disney very nearly made a direct-to-video sequel to Toy Story 2 after a bitter battle Pixar but luckily got to make it (reluctantly). They have now made one of the best film trilogies ever.Toy Story 3 is now set 10 years after the events of Toy Story 2: Andy (John Morris) is now 17, about to go to university and obviously not interested in playing with his toys anymore. Most of his toys are gone: only Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz (Tim Allen), Jessie (Joan Cusack), Bulleye the horse, Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head (Don Rickles and Estelle Harris), Slink (Blake Clark), Rex (Wallace Shawn) and Hamm (John Ratzenberger) remind. After a misunderstand Andy's toys, along with Molly's Barbie (Jodi Benson) are donated to Sunnyside Daycare and meet a group of toys, including Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear, AKA Lotso (Ned Beatty) and Ken (Michael Keaton). At first it seems that Sunnyside is a paradise but it quickly turns out that there are really a prison, with Lotso as the dictator. The toys have to escape and get back to Andy, but it is going to be difficult, with Lotso running a police state.Pixar have a simple philosophy, story comes first. It sounds so basic but it can easily be lost in most studios only thinking about what's marketable. But Pixar have shown time and again that people are willing pay for quality. With Toy Story 3 it is a film with characters we already know and love, a simple drive, getting back to Andy. There is a brilliant script, with a simple story and setting, with the theme of what do your toys get up to when you are not around, toys running the risk of being abandonment and the idea of growing up and putting childish things behind them. We get to see all the characters as they despair over their situation and trying to escape from Sunnyside. It is a story about moving on as well, the wonders of childhood and we get to see move of Andy who is now a man. We get to see the imagination of a child, from what Andy would have show, to physical actions of Bonnie (Emily Hahn), a shy child with a big imagination. With a simple story the writers are able to fit a lot in.Because it's a family film there is a lot of physical humour, such as Buster the dog now being old, fat and lazy and not wanting to help Woody. But there are clever verbal jokes as well, like when Barbie arguing political theory and philosophy. Spanish Buzz is also a great comic creation. Because the characters and the story is so engaging that they do not need to rely on referencing after film scenes and any film references are much more subtle. Plus Ken is a great creation for Toy Story.Lee Unkrich directs a fast paced film, focusing on the characters and the story. There is action, drama, comedy and even a little horror, with the threat of big baby. Everything about this film was well handled and shows all the strengths of Pixar. Unkrich also shows that no toys is truly evil and that some event normally drives them to it. It also fun that established actors were like Timothy Dalton and Whoopi Goldberg were willing to voice very minor roles.The ending was fitting for the series and emotional for the characters and the audience. It is a perfect end and there is no way a sequel can be made without the series repeating itself. A perfect family film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Paint-by-numbers Di$ney animation product.,"With their human going off to a noticeably generically-referred to ""college"", the now-idle toys mistakenly get shipped to a ""Cool Hand Luke"" prison-camp like daycare center. Hilarity generally does not ensue. A Big Wheel-sized amount of suspension-of-disbelief is needed to accept that somehow the Ned Beatty-voiced strawberry-scented Care Bear runs the prison, er, daycare, such that Woody & Co. are trapped in the toddlers room where they are tortured, er, played with. Since it was hard to accept the idea that the human day care mavens somehow couldn't simply put the toys into whatever room they wanted, I spent the time in the theater's darkness trying to develop a theory that the film was a veiled protest against secret CIA black-ops prisons. Given that the Patriot Act is still in effect, I will refrain from relating my ruminations on the subject. Anyway, the film has an intriguing voice cast such that it is populated deep into the character list with former actors who could open a film in their time. Also Don Rickles is in it. The script is passable with a reasonable amount of pathos for the younger target demographic but it lacks the winking adult-targeted asides such as those found in ""Monsters, Inc."" There is an attempt at this with the Ken doll trying to defend against charges of being a girl's toy but it never goes anywhere. This being Pixar, the animation is technically top-notch, however, since the toys-coming-to-life thrill is now some 15 years old, Disney must rely on the audience being too young to have encountered the conceit before. In short, this one goes into the over-rated Pixar films bin next to ""Finding Nemo"", and ""Ratatouille"" rather than into the Pixar classics bin which includes in this order: ""Wall-E"", ""Monsters, Inc"", ""The Incredibles"", ""Cars"" and ""Up"".",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Very good ending to a very good trilogy,"For the children born in the late 90s and early 00s, Pixar was what Disney had been for many of the earlier generations. A milestone of their childhood, a teacher of morals, one of their best friends even. A constant companion.I was personally born in the late 80s. As such, I can only imagine what thse children must have felt like watching this film and realizing that even an almost literal representation of their childhood had to grow up at some point. In Toy Story 3, Andy is heading to college. He has very little time for his toys anymore, most of them having gone years without being played with. So, what's a toy to do in such a situation?What amazes me the most about these three movies is how eerily similar they are on the surface level, but how different they feel. Because once again the toys get separated and find themselves in a strange environment. Once again they meet new toys with very different ideas about belonging to a child or getting played with. You could summarize all these movie with the exact same words, if you wanted. But they still talk about different subjects and they feel unique.Case in point, Toy Story 3 talks to a much more mature audience than its two predecessors. Sure, you can still watch it as a five-year-old, but its primary message is clearly aimed at those who were five years old when the original Toy Story came out. It wonders what it is like to grow up and look back at your childhood. It wonders what relevance or meaning your earliest memories have on you when you're an adult.And while it's doing that, we get a very good overall adventure, with great locations, fantastic animation, imaginative characters both heroes and villains alike, and some real tearjerker scenes. The ending, for example, which I personally find quite corny and unreal, but then again I wasn't a child when these movies came out. The ending cannot have the same impact on me.A very good movie and it would have been a fitting ending to this particular saga. It turns out it wasn't the ending we thought it was, but then that's show business for you.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The obvious conclusion.,"Lets get one thing straight: Toy Story 3 is not a bad movie. It follows the exact same formula as the previous two installments, and does succeed in bringing the series to its logical conclusion. The writing, voice acting and animation are no different from their predecessors -- that does not warrant discussion.The problem is that, as I said, it follows the logical conclusion. Chances are that, when you heard there was going to be a Toy Story 3, you or someone you know must have said ""Well the only way they could conclude it in a good way would be (yadda yadda yadda)."" And chances are that whatever was speculated is exactly what happens in the movie.In other words, its way too predictable. Even little kids will continually find themselves thinking ""Yup. Saw that one coming."" This is a spoiler-free review because I don't need to write spoilers; you'll know exactly what's going to happen with which characters as soon as they are introduced.This is ultimately what kills it. Five minutes in, you'll know how it's going to end.

Pixar Doesn't Disappoint,"Well, as always with Pixar, I expected something great. No disappointment. Absolutely none. And this is coming from a 15 year-old who enjoys action violence, Batman, Star Wars, Terminator, Bourne, and American Psycho. All that in mind, I can honestly say the Toy Story trilogy is one of my favorites. Yeah, I'll admit.The opening was creative and perfect, drawing from memories and lines dating back to Toy Story's first installment. It was warm and really sets an innocent mood. The ""home film"" flashbacks were another layer of cozy memories, and then fading music fast forwarded us to a harsher time. Flawless.Andy's age was the perfect way to explain (of sorts) the time lapse. I loved that they didn't try to just throw us back into the past. And now the gang was facing the impending doom Toy Story and Toy Story 2 warned them of. Again, flawless.And things turned out well for our beloved characters. And new beloved characters were introduced along the way.After I saw this film in theaters, what I could mainly focus on was the attention to detail. (What crisp animation!) If you've ever owned or had a child who owned one of those toy babies, then you know one eye ALWAYS starts to droop after a while. That made me laugh. Every scuff on a plastic surface, every graying of a stuffed animal, was convincing.The plot was great! It hard serious comedic moments that had everyone in the theater laughing. And honestly... this movie had actual moments of suspense. I won't give anything away, but it was fantastic. At one point, I even think I was tearing up.I would go ahead and say this movie, this whole trilogy, is EXCELLENT. Classic is more like it. The ONLY reason I didn't give it a 10 is because I can't quite put it up there with some of my favorites. No critique, simply personal. If you haven't had the chance to give this movie a viewing, I suggest you find the time to pick it up.Thanks for reading!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

A well-written piece that's timely for parents and kids.,"The movie did the impossible . . . again. They wrote and shot a movie sequel that outdid the previous one, as the second Toy Story did to the first film. This one was particularly well-written, and as a parent, I thought it was poignant to me and my children (both of which were under 10 at the time of the first flicks) considering that the story was based on the very realistic passage of time that stands between this film and Toy Story 2. In that regard, it was just as moving and touching for both myself and my wife as it was for our children, since our ages and situations are similar to Andy and his family in this third flick where the empty nest looms ever closer.The humour was great and broad enough to please everyone, with the characters acting just as fresh as they were as if they had just come out of the box, and despite my fears of them being somewhat 'rehashed', they came off as more interesting and funnier than the first times around. And, as per usual, the CG animation was up to Pixar's usual standard of excellence.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
So Long...,"""Toy Story 3"" is one the best movies of the year. Pixar, John Lassiter, and company have done it again—crafted a visually captivating movie and a sentimental story with heart. I saw ""Toy Story 3"" when it first came out over a month ago. I waited until now to write a comment—not really compelled to generate something quickly. Tom Hank's beloved cowboy toy Woody stares off to the distance and says, ""So long partner."" I got a lump in my throat. For me Woody is really saying, ""I will always love you, partner."" However, this catharsis of unconditional love and legacy does not seem to culminate from the chaos of the Daycare Center, the chases, and crises. Wonder if we could have arrived at the same space, otherwise. I recalled the eloquence of ""Toy Story 2"" with Sarah McLachlan singing ""When Somebody Loved Me"" over 10 years ago. I remember that fondly to this day, and being profoundly moved and inspired.I think ""Toy Story 3"" is great, but falls short of ""Toy Story 2"". Props to Director Lee Unkrich and Writers John Lassiter and Andrew Stanton for completing the trilogy in satisfying style. The animation is amazing and breathtaking. I loved the return of all the great character toys including Ken (Michael Keaton) and Barbie (Jodie Benson). However, I was puzzled by some of the darker narrative elements.In the story, Andy (John Morris) prepares to leave for college. He must decide what to do with his old toys. Obviously, he can't take them all with him—aside from perhaps Woody (Hanks). In a mix up the bulk of the toys including Buzz Lightyear (hysterical Tim Allen) end up as donations to Sunnyside Daycare. On the surface this may be new life for the toys—they will be loved by new children all over again. The subtext is unexpectedly menacing. So it is Woody to the rescue.The seemingly jolly teddy bear Lotso (folksy charming Ned Beatty) is so off. We get the creepiness factor which grows exponentially as the story unfolds. Also his partner is the hideously scary Baby Doll missing an eye. This is kind of a weird throw back to old school Disney movies which routinely and bizarrely incorporated evil narrative elements into children's stories. Even Lassiter and Stanton's back story on Lotso doesn't generate any authentic compassion or sympathy.The chases are fun, and the story lines about Buzz speaking Spanish are distracting escapist genius. However, all that and the final visually stunning conflict are not required to connect the dots to the point of the story which resonates with everyone. The point seems that as much as Andy loved Woody, Buzz, and company, they loved him back, too. Life continues on, always changing and evolving, and so does love. Unkrich seamlessly threads this in the beginning as Andy's Mom (solid Laurie Metcalf) is really heartbroken that Andy is all grown up, and starting a new stage in life, as well as herself. She raised Andy to be a good man, and she will always love him. And still there is a sense of loss in this. Unkrich and Lassiter suggest that much the same can be said of Woody and Buzz. You need not fret over their legacy, as well. Andy says of Woody, ""He'll never give up on you ever. He'll be there for you, no matter what."" That is also what a loving parent does.""Toy Story 3"" is the state of art in animation. And like all great Pixar movies ""Toy Story 3"" resonates with great heart and moves us. Whatever, narrative glitches and lively distractions occur in Act 2, Unkrich and Lassiter circle back and touchingly complete this life story. Life continues on-- we will always love those dear to us, and that too may be unrecognizable. That's just life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"The whole gang is back, and this time in the great escape","Better than the second one, this one returns many more toys in this movie. The gang is mistakenly thrown out as trash when Andy is about to go to college. The toys escape just in time and decide to go to be donated to the daycare. It becomes clear that there is a dictatorship when the new toys are tricked into the more rambunctious toddlers room. Meanwhile Woody gets out of the daycare only to be taken by another kid.There are two things I love about this installment of the franchise. First is the fact that there are more toys, and the whole gang is around. The interactions and the comradery that was a little thin in the second installment. All of it is back. And Barbie gets Ken to go along with her.Second is the great escape concept. It really works for these toys. The danger has never been more compelling. The victory has never been more sweet. It's a great idea for the story.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Review for Toy Story 3,"This was a film that I wasn't expecting to enjoy as much as I did. I'm not entirely sure why though. Everyone that I've talked to has been a fan and this was a great way to finish out this trilogy of films. Now I know that years later a fourth one came out. My wife, Jaime, and I decided to put this on for our daughter, since the first two would hold her attention at different times.Now this takes place 11 years after the earlier film. Andy (voiced by John Morris) is going off to college. The toys are doing what they can to get their owner to play with them, but that spark is lost. Andy is told by his mother that he needs to decide what to do with his things. He has options: trash, donate, attic or take with him to school.There is a mix up here. He meant to take Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) with him. The rest of his toys are going up to the attic. He used a garbage bag instead of a box and his mother thought it was trash. Woody goes out to save them before they're taken. The toys, thinking they were thrown out want to be donated to a local daycare, thinking that they'll be played with there. Woody gets mixed in with his friends as they're taken.It is there they meet a teddy bear who runs the place, Lotso (Ned Beatty). He works with other toys there. The tour seems like a promising new place for them. They'll always have children to play with them. Things aren't as nice as they appear and Lotso might not be as lovable as he looks.I've already played my hand a bit, but I loved this film. This one got me the feels for different reasons. The first is that it made me think of toys that I played with and what happened to them. Do I think they're alive and moving when I'm not looking? No, but it would explain why they could be difficult to find after the fact. Giving something that children love emotions like this does and then showing them move on to give that joy to someone else is great.Something else that I enjoy here is seeing all these old toys that I had now being in a daycare due to being donated. This is fun as well because they incorporate elements into their personality. That is done with Ken (voiced by Michael Keaton). He doesn't know why he's attracted to Barbie (voiced by Jodi Benson) and that made me chuckle.It should go without saying that Pixar is great at animating. It isn't my favorite style as I prefer the older school animation. This doesn't detract from my enjoyment as they do so well in making this seem real. That is impressive on itself and looks amazing. The voice acting here is also not only fitting, but star studded. I didn't even mention Tim Allen, Joan Cusack, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, Estelle Harris, Blake Clark, Timothy Dalton, Donnie Hunt, Kirsten Schaal, Laurie Metcalf and Whoopi Golberg. There's more on top of that.This trilogy is near perfect in my eyes and works so well showing the different stages of Andy's childhood as he goes off into adulthood.My Rating: 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Anything you expect from a movie, 'Toy Story 3' will deliver it to you.","If you want adventure, good laughs, high quality animation, or emotions, you can find all those in 'Toy Story 3', not by just bits such as 25% of each but each aspect achieving full potential making the whole movie 400%. It is a brilliant thinking to add daycare center to the storyline as a new setting. I am not a fan of sequel unless it is designed to be made before the original. In any other cases, whether or not the original is success, the story of sequel is 'added' to the finished one, making it very difficult to look plausible and natural. Plus, many sequels repeat what's been said and done before. However, third Toy Story is a whole another one with adored and familiar characters; it would be harder to be a failure. Animation quality is just next level even after 10 years. Each character distinctive of personalities, looks, and voices is just so wholesome and fun to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
An animated film whose psychological depth also appeals to adults.,"This is the third film of Toy Story franchise. The young Andy grew up, stopped to play and decided to donate most of his toys for a daycare, retaining only those he liked most, such as the inseparable Woody and Buzz Lightyear. But something goes wrong and everyone ends up in a daycare where a mysterious pink bear seems to rule. Directed by Lee Unkrich, this movie kept the voice actors from the first two for the central characters of the plot.Any connoisseur of good cinema knows that to make a good sequel it's necessary to establish a happy continuity with the previous films. Toy Story movies managed it easily and effectively by holding the cast core together: in fact, the major cast change in this film is the output of John Lasseter, standing on director's chair one of his co-directors in Toy Story 2, which shows us the importance of a stable team in the success of this franchise. Adolescence and the fate of toys when children's leave to play are important issues for the plot, despite having been addressed in the previous films. Some toys have, in their past, sad stories of abandonment related to that, a recurring situation in Toy Story's films, but which is of increased importance in this one, touching more particularly the most adult audiences, which makes this film the most adult of the franchise to date. Perhaps because of that, this movie was a huge success at the box office and critics resulting in several awards, among which are the Golden Globe for Best Animated Film, the BAFTA for the same category and, finally, the Oscar's for Best Animated Film and Best Original Song (""We Belong Together"").This is an excellent outcome for one of the most successful franchise's of animated cinema. A film for the whole family, which keeps the loyalty of the delighted audiences from the first film and still managed to conquered new audiences.

It was original and that is something we don't see very often, especially here where we copy everything you build and sell it back to you but breaks in 2 weeks. Ha ha. Toy story very clever and now computers do animater, whatever next? Robots take over the world now, humans are their slaves. So was amazing, looked great. Toy story 2 was exactly the same as first. Little bit different, now Woody was a girl. Woody is American slang for thing that should not be talked of to children. Why is it talked of to children in film for them? Is a bit wrong, I think. Ignoring disgusting innuendo, film was interest. Not very but kids like it and I like them to shut up. Everyone wins. Now third it out. Oh good, more toys to buy exactly like ones from last two films but now with new expensive features. Someone put jokes in and a bit of a story. Not much, just little bit. Is good for kids film. Kids like but as boy in movie, they get too old for this now. They don't want toys, they want girlfriend to sleep over. Woody is bad influence. So film OK for younger people. Still very nice. But this film in top 20 of all time best comedy. Is listed with classic movies but is just hour and half advert for things I don't want to have to buy for kids. No. Is good enough and score well for kids film. Better than Asian kids film where everyone dies. But compare to proper comedy... score is bad. Is not classic comedy. Think some people don't understand cinema. Is fine for people with bad education but if you have computer you be lucky enough to think well and should be clever than this. Film has no point. Message of this film is please buy more stuff. Not good for children really and what kind of adults watch? Left cinema thinking i was glad I saw different film and bought pirate DVD of this at station entrance from old woman with no teeth. Sadly disappointed with state of people who think this classic comedy. would score 7 for kids but would not buy more woody dolls even from market. Score only 4 as classic comedy.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"3rd ""Toy Story"" Funnier than its Predecessors: Has more Heart","Note: I was moronic in only giving this film 3.5 out of 5. I could not see (or maybe just didn't want to see) the darker, more mature elements at play in the film. I give the film 5 out of 5 stars today. It combines comedy, drama, thrills, and heart-wrenching moments into one of the greatest films I have ever seen. I despise the fact that a fourth installment is being made, and can only hope that it is worthy of this franchise. Please enjoy my review below.
Some film sagas and its characters you never forget. Shrek, Indiana Jones and Han Solo are a few of these characters. Oh yeah, and Harry Potter, too. Another set of these people are the ""Toy Story"" gang. Woody the headstrong cowboy (Tom Hanks) and Buzz Lightyear space ranger (Tim Allen) are the heads of this wonderful group, which also includes Hamm, the piggy bank (John Ratzenberger), Jessie, the cowgirl (Joan Cusack), and Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles).This time around, the toys' owner Andy is 17 and going off to college, meaning he hasn't played with his toys in some amount of time. Woody, however will be going with Andy to college. Everyone but Woody sees Andy's departure as him not caring for them anymore. So, when the toys see a box going to Sunnyside Day Care, they all hop in, to Woody's dismay. What they find there are new toys like Lotso (Ned Beatty, who's he?), Ken (Michael Keaton as Barbie's love interest), and many others. After Woody leaves the group to go back to Andy, the others soon discover these new friends may not be as friendly as they seemed originally.""Toy Story 3"" is the funniest of the trilogy. This is because they use dialogue as well as more visual jokes then in the previous installments. I almost cried at the end, which I never ever do in the movies. Whenever something bad happens to the toys, and bad things do happen to them here more then in the other two, you feel sad for them. The climax of the film may be scary to the very young child. I took two small kids to the movie with me and they weren't scared. Still, one or two scenes might frighten the youngest of kids. Some babies were crying at this point of the movie.I am always impressed with Pixar films. They keep coming up with original ideas that nobody else could. Every one (except ""Wall-E"") has made me happy to see it. I expected this franchise to take the same route as ""Shrek The Third"" did, and I was enormously surprised to see Pixar can do the job for sequels and threquels.Rated G for a Great Finale (P.S., Hopefully ""Cars 2"" will be good, stay tuned, or whatever)",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Most emotional animation film ever made, Thank you PIxar!!","I've never written a review on IMDb before so this is a first, I am writing a review because I simply need to let people know just how awesome this film is and if you've not seen it then GO AND SEE IT!! I enjoyed Toy Story 1 & 2, but none grips your emotion quite like this, I am a 26 year old Male and I cried like a baby at the end and so did my friend. Whilst been a continuation its very different TO 1 & 2. This film is very emotional with an amazingly written script and with very well thought out characters. Toy Story 3 had very high expectations and believe me when I say it EXCEEDED those expectations by far. This is the perfect film to take your kids to and don't feel bad if your an adult because it will make you cry just as it did with me and my friend, absolutely amazing, a huge well done and a thank you to Pixar for making such an amazing film. Will definitely be seeing this one again!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Once again Pixar delivers....,"I've been a Pixar/Disney fan since the first Toy Story came out. Every movie I saw in the theater (with the exception of Nemo which I saw on DVD) was great, and were classics. Now with Toy Story 3, the computer animation studio has once again created what might be the best G-rated movie I've seen in my life. Taking place years after the second one, the times have changed for the toys and the owner, Andy, and crazy stuff will happen. The 3-D in this movie is very good, since there are no gimmicky stuff popping at you. At 103 minutes, this is the longest Toy Story movie ever (second to The Incredibles in Pixar length), but moves along at a rapid pace. Go see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pixar never fail to amaze,"When it comes to kids films I'm usually the last in line but the prospect of a new Toy Story was a chance I couldn't miss, Pixar have mastered the difficult task of creating films that entertain all generations, and I had been eagerly anticipating a third film since the credits rolled on Toy Story 2 back in 1999. The first one hit the big screens when i was just eight years old and I have grown up with Andy, watching his toys run amok every time he closed his bedroom door, and becoming completely absorbed in the crazy situations they have encountered.We join Woody and Co. a few days before Andy packs up his belongings and heads off to college, misplacing his toys who end up donated to a children's daycentre instead of being packed away in the attic. It is down to Woody to convince the toys they haven't been abandoned and return them safely back home whilst avoiding crazy children, tyrannical toys and terrifying trash compactors along the way.Whilst the story remains fairly similar to the previous films, the introduction of a wealth of new characters (along with everyone's old favourites) adds to the enjoyment with comic characters such as an eccentric hedgehog, Mr Pricklepants, and the introduction of a hilarious romance between Barbie and Ken fleshing out the storyline with a healthy dose of humour. The eagle-eyed amongst you may even spot a character from one of Miyazakis movies appearing in a young girls bedroom, a subtle nod to one of the greatest animators of all time.One of the highlights of the film arrives after the credits have rolled with an alternative rendition of a memorable song from the first Toy Story, making it essential to stay in your seat right until the lights come up. It is also imperative that you arrive on time, as is usual with Pixar films you are treated to a short animation before the main feature and 'Night and Day' is definitely up there with the best of them, giving the audience a taster of the sheer brilliance they are about to behold.Toy Story 3 is an emotional ride; much like in Pixars recent releases Up and Wall-E, it is surprising how affecting a cartoon can be, with a number of poignant moments that will overwhelm even the most cynical of viewers. Even though the human characters only have minor roles in the story, the few lines they do have will resound deeply with everyone, and the mixture of characters at different points in their lives means that there will be a part of the story that relates directly to you on a personal level. It's not just about throwing out the old toys anymore, its about the process of growing up and those that have followed the story from its first incarnation will be saddened by the reminder that their own childhood has passed.Captivating from start to finish, Toy Story 3 is a triumphant reminder of Pixar's ability to blow all your expectations out of the water and in doing so they have delivered what could possibly be considered their greatest film to date. Essential viewing for everyone, Toy Story 3 is an unmissable extravaganza that is almost guaranteed a best picture nomination at next year's Oscars ceremony. Book your tickets right now, you would be a fool to pass up the chance to catch the final part of the trilogy in its full cinematic glory.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Best one,"My favorite of all time.The premise is one that both audiences - kids and their parents - can identify with. Andy is all grown up now, and for toys, that means one of three increasingly dire fates; the attic, the donation box or the trash. Stalwart hero and all-round team player Woody the Cowboy (Tom Hanks) refuses to lose faith in his owner, even when he stuffs his comrades in an attic-bound trash bag which, naturally, doesn't end up where it's supposed to.The final goodbye to old inanimate friends is hugely resonant to anyone with a secret attachment to their old toys, and the resulting plot - which sees the toys end up in a day-care centre, ripped to shreds by uncaring toddlers and controlled by a militant strawberry smelling bear with some severe psychological abandonment issues - will make you wonder if in fact donation wasn't crueller than keeping them in a box in the attic for twenty years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Wonderful Throwback to the Days of Pixar Yonder,"Like an old slugger on the downswing of his career, under the right circumstances Pixar can still knock the ball out of the park. Toy Story 3 is living proof, vivid and playful and touching and meaningful at or above the lofty levels of their mid-peak masterworks. With a true ensemble cast, it allows the old stars to spin their familiar spells while tossing in a few new supporting players (Michael Keaton as Barbie's beau Ken is especially entertaining) but wisely doesn't focus on any single character for too long. With a roster this well developed, still clicking deep in their third feature, why not celebrate that kind of rare, wonderful diversity? I'm glad Pixar waited to tell the right story, too: the level of care, meaning and power that's on display here simply doesn't come around all that often. Let's do it right or not at all, yeah? Needless to add, it's a stunner visually, with brighter colors, more brilliant settings and no shortage of Pixar charm fitting right in alongside the timeless character designs and visual themes of the two preceding films. An essential tale that's effectively moving, sweet, heartfelt and hilarious... and maybe even the best chapter of the trilogy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

A mixture of pure feelings that surround us in each scene starring Andy's toys. A perfect ending closes the film and at the end of the credits you cannot hold the tears,"Rescuing ""Toy Story"", ten years after the second film, reinforces that taking risks is also one of the virtues of the studio. It means the return to the franchise that marked an era in world cinema, having raised Pixar to the status it now maintains with ease. But they definitely know where they are stepping. They know the steps that must be taken to achieve the same success and, even better, those that must be taken to overcome it. That's right. ""Toy Story 3"" is better than its predecessors and ends with tears of happiness what was already historic. This third part is epic from the first scene. The opening sequence is already a warm-up for what will come next: lots of adventure, humor in the right measure and a delicious nostalgia. With each film, we follow a new stage in the life of Andy, the owner of the toys. Now, 15 years after we met him, he is ready to go to college and his mother puts pressure on him to fix his room, separating what will be kept in the attic, what will be donated and what will go to the trash. And then the action begins. After an oversight, all the toys end up in the orphanage and in the hands of too young children who abuse (in a good way) them.A good part of the film takes place inside this orphanage and there we are introduced to several new characters, such as metrosexual Ken (Barbie's eternal fashion boyfriend, with Michael Keaton's excellent and improbable voice), the pink bear Lotso (Ned Beatty) , the face phone called Chatter (Teddy Newton) and the Sparks robot (Jan Robson), the one that sparked from the chest. The interaction of the well-known toys with the new ones evokes a multitude of mafia and gangster films, in which the innocent inadvertently ends up being thrown into a vicious and dangerous structure, with a predefined hierarchy of command. Without delivering many surprises, for those who have not yet seen this wonder, it is worth calling attention to two transformations: that of Buzz in a hot Spanish lover (Javier Fernández-Penã masterfully replaces Tim Allen in those moments), which is to cry with laughter and that of Mr. Potato Head in Mr. Head of Tortilla. These are two moments that, alone, are already worth the price of admission.Directed by Lee Unkrich (co-director of ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Monsters Inc.""), replacing John Lasseter, ""Toy Story 3"" easily touches the viewer's heart, especially adults and teenagers. It is a sad, melancholic film that touches on universal themes, such as friendship, love, farewell and even death. It is impossible not to become fond of the life trajectory of toys, in love with their owner, but aware that goodbye is practically inevitable. They will separate forever, with the deep pain that those two words bring with them. However, there is no lack of humor. Michael Arndt's script (""Little Miss Sunshine"") knows how to transition from his highest humanistic pretensions to comedy. New characters fulfill this function very well, like the hilarious and vain Ken (responsible for one of the best scenes in the entire film), while the ""veterans"" also make their jokes, like Mr. And Mrs. Potato Head, or even Buzz, always with his functional problems no less funny. The dialogues may not even be one of the best built by Pixar. Nor could they. After all, the main characters are children's toys. But the script seeks to answer each sentence said apparently without explanation or to justify the insertion of something or someone shamelessly. Here, then, is the differential of the studio. Nothing is by chance. The intention is in each word spoken and action mounted. Even a good part of the jokes has some meaning. The detail of the garbage man's musical taste is just one example of how meticulous the script is.But what really differentiates this third part from the others is that John Lasseter (creator of the story, who won a script by Michael Arndt) brought Andy to the medium as an essential character, not just an accessory seen from a distance. It is the first time that a human has gained a prominent role in the franchise and he is not alone, as we are introduced to Bonnie (Emily Hahn), who we soon identify as the boy's successor. There, in the epilogue, the interaction of the two is touching and can bring an adult to tears for the intrinsic beauty of the moment and also for a nostalgic effect difficult to explain. A jewel considering, after all, that this is a second continuation. One of the strengths of Pixar in relation to its competition is that this is not the whole plot of the feature. They are not concerned with just having a simple bow to develop. At every turn, much more happens and the characters encounter new challenges, which force them to stop, think and work as a team.In Toy Story 3, Andy's main toys are present, each with its own peculiar peculiarity. There is a huge wave of new characters, most of which are merely supporting characters. The adventure is also there, right from the start, with Andy's fantasy with his toys. The adventures of Woody and his gang also guarantee good times and excitement until the end. However, Toy Story 3 is a fun movie, but it is not perfect because for a long time it leaves the feeling of being just another adventure of Woody and Buzz. What happens also thanks to some clichés used in the script. One of them is the villain of the story. Letting Lotso, a strawberry-scented pink bear, to lead an evil army works efficiently, especially after his frustrations are revealed to the public. A giant baby like his partner brings extra horror to the troupe's evil deeds. The adventure resulting from the confrontation generated by these differences in character is also one of the most exciting, with the right to meticulously combined plans and executed with the highest degree of originality.The new toys give a colorful look that pleases the eyes and reaches the child audience in full. Even this is the big reason for so many new characters, since few are actually used in the plot. However, there is also a great find in the script: Ken. Not exactly the presence of the doll, and all the symbolism that he and Barbie automatically bring, but the way it is seen in the present day. There are a number of adult jokes, involving their behavior and dress, that are delicious. The little ones may not fully understand its meaning, but the older ones are sure to recognize them.However, Toy Story 3 is unable to completely escape the formula established by the original film and ends up reheating characters and situations. It is perhaps the natural burden of a sequence that may even feel the obligation to review a certain structure that has already captivated the public. Notice how, for example, your script is repetitive: there is the escape of Woody from the nursery, then the escape of the rest of the nursery, and then, here we witness - yes, you guessed it! - the escape of all together from the old iron. Escape, escape, escape, in a cadence similar to that of previous films, without really, by Pixar standards, innovating. Furthermore, the script flirts dangerously with the exacerbated, almost Manichaean sentimentality, which dictates what the viewer should feel, without any semblance of subtlety. For example, the moment ""hand in hand"", although it is beautiful, is too manipulative and implies an end that simply would not happen, right away breaking any tension of the moment.And a little later, in the final scene, the film gives us a low blow, a punch in the stomach that hits another organ: the heart. When everything was heading for the outcome of what would be just a fun movie, Pixar takes another rabbit out of the hat and reminds us of why the series exists. With an end of impressive sensitivity and delicacy, it is inevitable to remember your happy moments with that toy that you loved so much. There is an immediate syntony between the spectator and the film, which makes it, like the previous ones, also enter the affective memory. The way Andy sees his old friend, and detaches from him to let a little girl play and take care of them, even asks if he didn't know that his toys had life, because in addition to allowing them to survive, it still gives them the opportunity to look on the horizon, he was moving away, towards college, towards adult life.Between new characters - Bonnie and the toys under Lotso's command - and the interaction between them and the gang of Woody and Buzz, in addition to a CGI of unmatched quality and hat-taking, with textures and colors to mesmerize the viewer, Toy Story 3 manages to be located a few steps above the second film, a feat that in itself deserves applause. It is not every day that a studio manages to revitalize its franchise to the point of catapulting it to the ""billionaire's club"", especially considering the time spent between one film and another. There are also no words to explain why ""Toy Story 3"" is so good. It is a mixture of pure feelings that surround us in each scene starring Andy's toys. A perfect ending closes the film and don't be surprised if at the end of the credits your eyes are watery. It is simply the result of the harmony of a feature film belonging to a studio that, fortunately, never tires of producing masterpieces of animation.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Such a good ending to the original trilogy,"Rewatched the first two Toy Story movies recently, so it only made sense to revisit the third. Once upon a time, I would have put this above the first, but maybe not any more. They're neck and neck, but that first one is such an important film from a historical perspective, it was the original and the most groundbreaking, and it had the tightest screenplay/best character development of all three.The one thing that is notable about Toy Story 3 is that the animation is hugely improved- arguably almost too much. With the exception of the Ken and Barbie characters, most of the main toys move more fluidly than any of the toys did in the first two, which is noticeable if you watch them close together. But it's a tiny thing ultimately, and not a very significant complaint when all the other improved aspects of the animation benefit the film.It might not be as consistent as 1 and 2 either, as it has a good (but not great) first half. But everything from the prison break on is gold, Spanish Buzz, Mr Tortilla Head, the garbage dump scene, the final moments... the film soars in its second half (with a genuinely menacing villain, too) and it serves as a great concluding chapter for the original Toy Story trilogy.It's very funny, it's very moving when it wants to be, and it's paced nice and fast throughout, just like all the Toy Story movies. The ""merely"" good first half does contrast against the fantastic second half, but all in all, it's still a very strong movie, and one of the last truly great Pixar films (okay, I briefly forgot about Inside Out. That one is great, too).",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Great Ending to the most beloved Toy Story.,It continues the adventure of Andy's toys when he is now 17 years old and is going to collage. The Toys were never got played with. So they continue the adventure that is very fun. The new characters were good to. I like the new villain Lots of Hugging Bear. They were trapped and they need to get out of sunny side as quick as possible. The best scene is the ending. So touching when Andy is now getting his toys to a little girl name Bonnie. Toy Story 3 is a very good film. Its as good as the other two films. It's one of the best franchise sense Lord of the Rings. If you love Toy Story then you gonna love this one.

Pixar has done it again,"WOW!Was the only thing I can think of after leaving this terrific film. Toy Story 3, is a family orientated movie that will leave you in tears by its conclusion.

Toystory 3-not anymore a reliable animation,"I was expecting for a top 250 movie to be at least decent because it's top 250. Instead i get one piece of animation full of clichés.

It hit me hard in the heart the way only PIXAR can. And time has just made it grow. If you watch any retrospective review of it, they talk about the layers this movie has, the symbolism, the meaning.

Truly AMAZING!! End of an era and done in style!!,"The wait is over, and after 10 years of wait Toy Story 3 has finally come out. This movie was somewhat special to me as even at the age of 20, I have grown up with Woody, Buzz and the gang and was just as, if not even more excited for this installment.Being an avid movie lover, I have seen plenty of films over the past 20 years. Having an older brother helped with all the classics we have seen to this day, but Toy Story was one that was brought out for my generation. Out of the hundreds, maybe even thousand of movies I have seen, the Toy Story series would be right up there in my top 5 and didn't want this one to let the series down. This was NO way a let down as I never thought it would but is the best of the 3.From start to finish, this movie will keep you entertained and instantly a must watch again as the way I rate a 'good' movie is one you can watch over and over without getting bored.As I watched one of the later showings at the cinema, my thought was that 'it will be OK, I'm sure many people will not be excited,' and boy I was wrong. The screen was packed full of adults and the queue was the longest I have seen at the cinema for a long time.One big thing I have to say is that this is NOT just a kids movie. From watching previous Toy Stories you think that you are a little bit too old for the gags, but this was not true as this screen, packed out by people mainly 18+ was as loud as any. In this film there were plenty of 'laugh out loud' moments, bringing in plenty of old gags into new and slipping them in tremendously, bringing you back to when we were younger when we were pointing and laughing whilst watching the first two in the cinemas.This movie does not get stale in any part and keeps you at the edge of your seat with like the first two 'a great escape' feel to it which will keep you at the edge of your seat regardless of your age. Like any other, Tom Hanks, Tim Allen and the crew, even though only voicing it, still know how to make the movie as good as it is and paired with there characters you can just feel the relationship between the two doing a great job behind the scenes.Not only will this movie leave you excited or screaming with laughter but you have to remember that this is an ending to the Toy Story series and never have I left a movie so close to tears and I am not scared to admit it.Like any pixar the story just sticks together and no matter how weird or wacky the story is, it works like a charm. How do you get a bunch of toys that come alive whenever they want, being mistakenly taken away or lost, to fight there way back home to there owner..............3 times and make each one an instant classic. The people at pixar are plain and simple geniuses who add something that no other movies do. There is not one bad pixar film out there and it shows who's the leader of the pack as Toy Story was the first sequel pixar had done, they had to do another one.To the sad part, not many films have excitement, laughter and tears all in one movie, but Toy Story plays with your emotions more than any. The most heart breaking thing is that this is an end of an era, even though John Lasseter and Lee Unkrich have announced they would like to keep the characters alive (whether its a fourth or just putting them in for cameos) the importance of these characters are shown in the director, producer and writers reactions and how they do not want to forget any of the bright and funfilled toys. This was a great way to end this film series and wow they have executed it brilliantly. I truly believe this is a tear jerker so I think you should bring some tissues, as Toy Story is going out with a complete BANG!! This movie brings childhood to back to you and makes you remember when you were younger and how you use to be. This is a MUST SEE by single person out there as you will NOT be disappointed. I have not left a cinema with a massive smile on my face in a long time and this was the film to do it.This is truly and end of an era and am sad to see Toy story come to an end, but what a way to go out.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Fantastic end to a fantastic trilogy,"How many times have you cried at a movie aimed at kids? There are only a few notable examples with Bambi perhaps being the most popular. Well now you can add Toy Story 3 to that list. Pixar's third and, most likely, final outing for Woody, Buzz and co. has all the hallmarks of a Pixar movie. Eye meltingly beautiful animation, silly jokes aimed at kids, clever jokes aimed at adults and a surprising amount of adult content hidden in the subtext.It had been 12 years since the second movie when Toy Story 3 was released but the folks at Pixar haven't missed a beat. Fittingly, we join Woody and the gang as they reach the end of their 'careers' as Andy's toys. Andy is now 17 and heading off to college, leading the toys to the realisation that they are no longer needed. A mix up with the garbage leads to the toys being sent to Sunnyside day care – a child's nursery which shares more than a passing resemblance to a retirement community.It sounds a little depressing but this couldn't be further from the truth, as Woody and co. meet some of Pixar's most memorable characters to date, with Micheal Keaton's Ken doll being a particular highlight. The plot plays like a toy version of The Great Escape as the toys realise everything is not as rosy as it appears and must subsequently engineer an escape. There are some truly inspired scenes which take advantage of the central premise of toys coming to life; such as a group of toys playing poker inside a vending machine, a traumatic pre-school playtime at Sunnyside and a spectacular ending inside a trash compactor.The subtext of retirement lends the film an emotional undercurrent not normally found in a kid's movie and you may find yourself complaining of something in your eye on more than one occasion; but you will be doing so with a huge smile on your face.A masterpiece of animation from a company at the very top of its game. Toy Story 3 builds on the successes of its predecessors to deliver an emotionally charged, hilarious ending to the trilogy. A must see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Amazing, great movie.","This movie was such a pleasure to watch it was just fantastic! The plot was well made, animation priceless. All aspects were well made and a quality balance of emotion, action and comedy. This movie is appropriate for children up to grown ups, and is just as emotional and action packed Even for an adult. This movie gives a sense that even toys have emotions and that's a jumble to make, but they have made it a perfect balance and everything about it is just... Wow! The ending was so good, and it was an exciting movie to watch. It was not predictable and most appropriate.

An Instant Classic-Pixar did it again!,"Pixar tried to revisit their cult franchise of Toy Story and contrary to my presumption it manages to create another classic. Generally sequels don't live up to the hype but Toy Story 3 has got it all for everyone - from audience to critics and perhaps go miles ahead of last two installments. Story is something really one can connect. I mean what you will do with your toys when you become old enough. That's the core of story. The story has been supported by crisp screenplay. From begin to end Toy Story 3 will keep you on the edge of seat. Adults, teenagers, oldies, ladies and of course, kids - all will like this because there's something for everyone in parts as well as whole.In the characters, woody and buzz light year (check out his Spanish lingo) are as usual great. But some other characters are also worth mention. Barbie and Ken, The Rex, The three eyed aliens (my favorite), the evil pink & fluffy teddy bear-Lotso, the potato couple and the baby were all fun to watch. On technical side, animation is, as expected, stand out. Sound effects are simply amazing.All in all, one of the best films of the year - Repeat watch guaranteed!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Simple Teenage Review of TS3 *NO spoilers*,"I just have to say that this is without a doubt one of the BEST movies of the decade. It beats out Toy Story One and Two a million to one. It causes you to laugh hysterically at parts and ball your eyes out of sadness at others. (Keep in mind that I enjoyed the first two)It's got something for everyone. It's great for children, PERFECT for older teens, and even great for adults. There were quite a few very emotional adults in the theater I was in. All around, it's not audience age specific, but I do recommend having seen the others before this one if you haven't. Although the others aren't NEARLY as good as this one, you feel more attached after having seen the others.Another note: The 3D doesn't really add or take anything away from the movie, so if you want to save some money, see it in regular theaters. It's up to your personality, but it really doesn't add or subtract. It's just there.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
TS3 is a 10!,"I saw this film in theaters in June 2010 with my wife and son. My son at the time was about ten months old, and at points in the film, he was a bit frightened. The last twenty minutes or so of the film in particular were a bit scary for him, however, much most of the film is fairly lighthearted and funny.The character of Lotso Bear is like many people we may all know, he seems okay on the outside, wanting to help, but on the inside, he is secretly evil and quite insane, as revealed well into the film.In the third installment, we find Woody, Buzz and all their pals thrown into a preschool, unsuspecting to the horrors there. Andy is heading off to college and his mom accidentally donates his toys. A preschool, run like a prison by the demented Lotso Bear, who hates all new toys, thinking they are taking his place. In the end, good prevails over evil and the toys are again reunited with Andy. However, Andy feels the toys would be better off being played with while he is in college and gives them to a little girl down the street.Toy Story 3 was a unique film. The touch with the audience since the original in 1995 was not lost.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Toy Story 3,"Toy Story 3 is the Toy Story that introduces the fact that daycare exists and shows that their kid (Andy) could outgrow them. Andy has grown up and is about to go to college. Andy wanted to put his toys in the attic but after a little mishap, the toys ended up going to Sunnyside Daycare. There, they met Lotso Hugginbear, of whom helps settle all the toys down. It really shows the difference between younger kids and older kids when playing with toys. The younger ones seem more rough and older ones seem more gentle. With the storyline with Lotso, it is the darkest Toy Story movie. As well, the ending could be emotional to fans of the franchise. It could be a good ending to the franchise but we got a fourth anyway and the fourth also ended on a note that it could be the last one and we're still getting a fifth.Comparing it to the first two, it does show how computer animation has evolved in the 11 years in between the second one and this one. I often prefer the first two, though I still like this one very much.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

The Perfect Way to End the Trilogy...Yes to END,"""Toy Story"" hits the center of a very powerful Venn diagram. The one is how it is a revolutionary film. It is a technical marvel, the first fully CGI animated feature. Since that day, the whole landscape of animation and family movie blockbusters.The other aspect is its nostalgic connection. I saw this movie back in 1995 when I was 5 and Andy was a child. For ""Toy Story 3"" when I was going off to college in 2010, Andy was likewise heading out for college. For that reason, this movie has a clear relatability for this particular critic that grew up with the main character. The same way Andy has to move on and leave his childhood toys behind, I had to do the same with these characters.And finally, beyond everything this film is just a good entertaining film. Despite any box office and critical acclaim, this movie is just really good. The movie has its deeper themes and big lessons to teach. It got nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, but at the end of the day, that wouldn't matter if the movie itself was not fun.The main thing of the movie is kind of a prison break flick but with the toys. It is a fun ensemble cast of both heroes and villains.This movie hits all the right beats. The animation, voice acting, and music is all peak Pixar performance. This film has a good share of jokes, and it is quite funny. But what people remember this movie, and most Pixar pictures for, is for the tear-jerking moments. And this film absolutely delivers on that. This film hits the audience hard with the feels as the story concludes. This was absolutely the perfect way to end a legendary trilogy. And I repeat, this was the perfect way to END THE TRILOGY.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Childhood Favourite that Still Holds Up Brilliantly,"I just love this film so much. It's funny, heartfelt, beautifully animated and contains one of my favourite villains of all time in Lotso, who works as a relatable and scene-chewing villain at the same time. As with all of the films in the Toy Story franchise, it manages to look at an interesting perspective on the life of a toy in what their life would be like at a daycare, and the execution is second to none. The characters are still as fun as ever to see on screen, and the new characters are given enough screen time to each have distinct personalities and quirks whilst still not taking the focus off of the central plotline. I think now, as I start to grow out of things that I enjoyed when I was younger, the Andy parts really hit home for me. And the ending is quite possibly my all-time favourite. It is the perfect balance of closure and optimism for the toys' future. It is just a miracle of a film that I love every second of.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Love Buzzlight year,"Love Buzzlight year. The years have passed and Andy has grown up and is set for college. Woody & the gang haven't been played with in years and face the dire consequences of human aging. Before they come up against this situation, they are thrown into one last adventure, where they will have to escape an evil teddy bear that resents being replaced by a young girl.Pixar's magic always seemed to work because they managed to mix a good story with nice comedic elements and great emotional moments. Basically the goal was to explore human feelings by presenting us with a beautiful animated world, where anything can happen. The balance between real world conflicts and an imaginary existence was mostly the secret behind Pixar's success. So it's no surprise that Toy Story 3 not only embodies this, but may have the best execution of that idea. Never have I been more in sync with the plot and the characters in a movie. They laugh, I laugh, they get scared, I get scared, and most of all, they cry, I cry. In what I can describe to you as the best 10 minutes I've ever seen in a movie, animated or live action, Andy says goodbye to his childhood by passing down his toys to a new owner. He will always remember them, and they, in return, will always be there for them.So if you know what it's like to let go of your childhood and grow up, but still crave a nice reminder of those carefree times, Toy Story 3 is the perfect film for you. I'm 18, and even I already feel like Andy and all others that can relate. This is my favorite film of all time, and it may very well be for years to come. Just breathtakingly perfect.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Just as good, no brilliant as the predecessors.","After seeing all the hype and good press about this film I thought this was going to be brilliant as Toy Story is what Pixar have done best in my view. In Toy Story 2 we got a very ominous piece of dialogue about how Andy is growing up and there is nothing Woody can do about it. I loved that they went with this approach with the next film as they could have just played it safe and have Andy as an excitable child again for the third act but it all comes full circle and we finally see Andy as young man going off for pastures new leaving his childhood behind. Without meaning to sound too deep and meaningful this is something we can all relate to as we've all had that feeling of having to leave our most precious of memories behind. As an 18 year old I can relate to it now.This was an ambitious but fantastic way to round off a story that has been brilliant from start to finish. Andy is conflicted when thinking what to do with his childhood toys and a mix up makes the toys go out to the trash. After avoiding that doom they find themselves in daycare all the while Woody remains loyal to Andy as he tries to think of a way to get back to his owner and join him at college. The toys eventually find out it isn't as good as they would have liked. A theme that we saw in the first film but felt just as fresh right here and now. Again just like the other two films it is brilliantly written with many references in this case especially to prison escape films and many more to mention. We also have new characters to which the highlight is Barbie's love interest Ken to the credit of the makers made some fantastic jokes both subtle and in your face about the character. We see plenty from all the characters involved and it never escalated into farce which is something that the Toy Story films have always managed to avoid. The story also goes in a darker direction as we get some slightly more sinister characters playing the villains in this film which again is a testament to how well it is written and we also get some very emotional scenes, I won't give anymore away but if you have any emotion you'll be gripped by it! The film also avoids dragging too long and I found myself wanting more even though it gave me everything I could possibly want from the film. This is the first review in which I have given a 10 and I am completely justified as it is the most fun actual fun not just enjoyment I have gotten out of a film in a long time. Plus it gives a great sense of nostalgia and will make you want to see the other two films again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
And yet another masterpiece for Pixar!,"I cannot give Toy Story 3 any rating below 10 - amazing! It is not often these days when I leave the theater touched and eager to see a film again, an animated film no less. However, Woody and the gang delivered yet again.Although a film suitable for the tots, I was completely enthralled. The plot was suspenseful and exciting to the very end, especially the climax where even my teenage brother got teared up. Not to mention, the comedy had great timing, and some comedic moments, while obviously appropriate for young children, could be taken as having a more adult sentiment without going too far - the film did a fantastic job at reaching all audiences.As this film rounds out the Toy Story trilogy, it definitely offers a few glimpses into the past, while simultaneously giving a fresh, new spin on the storyline.A must-see!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

This actually is Pixar's best. Seriously.,"Whether you like, love or detest Pixar's films, the fact is, that they are very good story tellers and globally, their films will always receive rave reviews, as did this potentially final instalment of the film that first made them famous. The expectations were high and though they have never made a dud film, I feel that since the Incredibles, Pixar films have lacked in the entertainment department, if only so slightly.What works for this film is that it has all the lovable characters we've come to enjoy on the big screen. From Woody, Buzz, Rex and Mr. Potato to Bulls-Eye, Jessie and Buster, there are a whole host of them to enjoy and of course we are introduced to a bundle of fantastic new characters, the picks of which are Ken, Big Baby and Lots-O-Huggin' Bear.Andy has grown now and is on his way to college. He hasn't played with his toys in a very long time and the toys themselves are feeling neglected. When he begins to clear his room and stumbles upon them, he decides to put them all in the attic except Woody, who he is taking to college with him. But as one thing leads to another, Andy's mom, accidentally thinking it's a bag filled with garbage, throws the plastic bin liner out for the garbage truck. Though the toys escape, they believe that Andy was going to get rid of them so the toys, much to Woody's dismay, end up going to a day care centre where they meet up with other toys.Firstly, lets congratulate Pixar on coming up with a very unique storyline. This could have been a really terrible film and a money-making scheme gone wrong, as so many sequels usually are. But right from the very start, the team have put together a strong film with lots of emotional content.The animation is obviously incredible and the expression on each and every single toy is too good to describe. Every emotion is captured so perfectly that it is as though the toys are actually alive and you can feel everything they convey, Woody being particularly exquisite.Another plus point for this film, visually and emotionally aside is the mood of the film. Yes, there is emotion, which I will come to in a moment, but there is also huge amounts of laughter and it allows the film, which has lots of dark moments, to be broken up nicely. Ken's clothes show and Buzz's Spanish session are two moments that stand out immensely.My four year old son loved Toy Story 1 and 2, yet there were times when his mind wondered because the story gets so deep at times that there are portions where the action lacks, and this is unfortunate for children under six. But that is not a bad thing. Especially when you consider that the previous two instalments had a lot of mature contents in them too.This film is definitely darker as well, which proves that Pixar are very bold and daring. They've given us a lot to ponder over in the past but Toy Story 3 gives us much more to think about. Not only is this film very sinister (my son jumped twice) but like I mentioned before, it has a very emotional message to it, and when the final credits begin to roll, you cannot help but feel sad, and that in itself is impressive for an animated film about toys.The actors are obviously excellent and the new additions, Michael Keaton's Ken and Ned Betty's Bear especially are superb additions to an array of fantastic characters. Some of these however have very little to do and if it wasn't for a little bit of research, I may not have known who the voices belonged to; Whoopi Goldberg and Bonnie Hunt being two big names that had little to say.There are moments of predictability in this, but that is expected, otherwise the film may have been far too complicated for many youngsters to follow. The more I think about the film however, the more I realise how good it is. Yes, to compare oneself to any of the previous two Toy Story films is not an easy thing to do, but after careful consideration, I will be brave enough to say that this is the best in the trilogy and possibly Pixar's best film of all time.BEST SCENE: The entire finale; I honestly couldn't predict if they were going to succeed in their mission or be betrayed or fail or a number of things. Shiver.FINAL VERDICT: There is no other possible way this could have concluded. Emotional, dark and riveting, Toy Story 3 surpasses both its predecessors in almost every way. This is definitely a fantastic film and now it's a fantastic trilogy.10/10 – Un-miss-able",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Masterpiece Pixar. Crying at the end of the story,"Toy story 3 is one of those animated films with a perfect plot, providing teaching to all ages, and an emotional touch at the end of the film that everyone even agrees with a sad ending that will make you at least teary-eyed at the end credits.I never thought at all when watching this film that I would be carried away emotionally. Pixar brings us the perspective of toys when they are abandoned and no longer cared about by their owners and hope that the owners will at least play with them once. With such good conflict, it's fitting that Toy Story 3 took home the Oscar as best animated film. I rank Toys Story 3 on a par with timeless classic Pixar films such as Finding Nemo, Toys Story 1&2, The Incredible, and of course Up.This further cements Pixar's name as the greatest animation mecca of this century.

Pixar did it again!,"I was extremely nervous when I first found out about Pixar coming out with Toy Story 3. I basically grew up with the first two movies, which were amazing. The thought of Pixar making a trilogy out of Toy Story was nerve-racking. After leaving the theater, all doubts that I could ever have had about Pixar and their capability were gone. Pixar, once again, had demonstrated their ability to overcome expectations. Toy Story 3 was one of the best sad comedies that I have ever seen. I love how mostly everyone can relate to it. At some point of everyone's lives, one has to move on and leave behind the toys that he/she really cared about. I can relate to the character Andy because I, also, had to put toys away before leaving for college. It is a love/hate relationship because you know that you need to move on, but at the same time the thought of leaving them behind can scare anyone.I really have nothing bad to say about the movie. Toy Story 3 was simply amazing. I guess that the only thing that made my experience kind of weird was that I went to the theater with my ten-year – old sister. It made me feel really old because Toy Story is more of my generation, not hers. I had to go home right after and show her the first Toy Story.Out of the trilogy, I definitely have to rate Toy Story 3 second, right after Toy Story. I was not really a fan of the second one, but yet again, I usually don't like sequels. I feel like Toy Story 2 did not really have a point to it. Toy Story 3 definitely brought me back to my childhood with Toy Story. Just seeing all the familiar faces gave me Goosebumps. Pixar did it once again!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
An emotional roller-coaster,"There's something about the Toy Story franchise that is universally emotive. Presumably that ""something"" is the fact that everyone had toys as a child. Toys taught us how to love. Not loving someone because they are related to us, or because they live on our street and happen to be our age, but because we feel a connection to them. Now, as grown-ups, we all know that toys are only toys and our love is wasted on them. I suppose that's what is so haunting about these films. They remind us all of that part of ourselves that left us many years ago, and dredge up guilty feelings about old Rebecca the Christmas Bear who now sits, dusty in the attic somewhere...if she's lucky. Toy Story 3 deals with just that idea. It is about what happens to the toys when Andy grows up. The film begins with the toys in a typically epic adventure. It is complex, it involves teamwork and it could be dangerous. As it turns out, the toys are plotting a very complicated ploy to get Andy to play with them. He is 19 now, and headed off to college. The toys have been sitting in their chest for years now, without being played with at all. When a chain of events see the toys accidentally donated to a day-care facility, the race is on for the toys to be reunited with their owner before he leaves for college. If the first film was sci-fi, the second was a western then this is a prison movie. Their ""great escape"" is just as exciting and fresh as the previous two outings and certainly just as hilarious. However, what makes this film special is that it balances heartbreak and loss with warm-hearted sentiment so it never feels depressing, but certainly has a sense of tragedy looming throughout. We know there can be no happy ending and that whatever comes our way in the third act will make us sad, but the journey there is so joyous that the tone never gets too blue. Writing about Toy Story 3 is difficult because it is not about the little bits of clever writing and brilliantly realised characters or perfectly balance sense of humour. This film is so much more than the sum of its parts. It accomplishes what so few children's films can. It gives equal pleasure to children and grown-ups. It manages to entertain but also make the audience feel truly invested in the fate of these characters...these toys! No easy task! This is perfect popcorn viewing for all the family and I dare you to sit through this film without at least a small lump in your throat. If this film doesn't make your heart simultaneously jump for joy and burst with emotion, you're made of stone!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Toy Story 3,"My original plan was to have a Toy Story trilogy orgy thoroughly in one day because I am so ashamed that I haven't watched the first two films yet, then I kept postponing the project indefinitely as not enough time could be squeezed for such a feast. So the day before yesterday I incidentally watched the third one on TV, though discontinuously, it did prompt me to watch it last night.As a sequel, TOY STORY 3 might be not as splendid or original as Pixar's recent mega-hits UP (2009) and WALL-E (2008), since in a world full of toys, there is not much room left for grandeur milieu. However the whole team behind is extraordinarily decisive and intelligent to mold every single character with respective personalities, even for the trivial sidekicks, which creatively leave indelible impressions on my mind.As a matter of fact, the mammoth success of the film is mainly the victory of a superb script from John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Michael Arndt and the director Lee Unkrich. It could effortlessly project an empathetic impact upon anyone as long as he/she could still recall his/her childhood memory, (for children of course no problem, and as for adults, the repercussions are even more vigorous, its positive messages of intrepid friendship and the soulful revelation of grow-up triumphantly moves everyone, regardless of the fact that if you have watched TOY STORY (1995) or TOY STORY 2 (1999).For the fun part, the film has numerous wisecracks and innocuous gags all along the way, the prison-break set piece is adeptly maneuvered (the hand-in-hand resolution is as affectionate as unexpected), but the real epiphany comes near the end, it's a tear-jerking moment to wave goodbye to the past, especially those are composed of happiness and joy, we all grow up like Andy, and I do yearn for my old childhood toys (mainly cartoon books though).The film is also perfect for its score (Randy Newman's We Belong Together has a fatal empathy when playing during the end credits), and all other technical aspects are arranged with Pixar- esque delicacy and accuracy (the editing and art direction particularly).The voice cast contributes the minimum wage here, but Buzz Lightyear's Spanish mode is my favorite stunt in the film, invincibly hilarious all over the globe.Ignoring this year's CARS 2, Pixar solidifies its status of representing the apex of the animation film field and what's is more precious is that they master the recipe of fabricating allegorical fairy tales which accommodate almost an entire demography and offer a perfect shelter for us, which we still can self-consciously engage ourselves into the miraculous web of contemporary films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Absolutely fantastic for a trilogy (I suppose),"When you excel at your career, this happens: everyone looks to you for excellence, so everything that falls short of that feels like a disappointment.Although ""Toy Story 3"" is a beautiful movie that is humorous, heartwarming, and brilliant in the greatest Pixar movie tradition, expectations are unavoidably raised due to the studio's practically faultless history, which includes the first two ""Toy Story"" films.Then, as the film approaches its finale, ""Toy Story 3"" takes an unexpectedly gloomy turn that might be too harsh for younger children before turning overtly saccharine at the very end. Adult spectators will undoubtedly cry a little bit.

Watching Andy be a grown up had me crying, thinking that would be ME in a few years...going off to college- leaving my room with all my cute stuffed animals.

"Toy Story 3: Finally, the Third Time's a Charm","Pixar has never failed to deliver a worthwhile movie-going experience. Everything Pixar has done is better than anything Dreamworks has done, and that includes Shrek, because Pixar movies have story, and heart, and a respect for the audience. All this said, I was afraid to see Toy Story 3, because it is a sequel to a sequel, something Hollywood has never done well. Take the Godfather saga—Godfathers 1 and 2 are the iconic American story; Godfather 3 is mess made long after the others and starring the director's daughter. Or take the blatant case of ""I have no ideas left, but can still make some money""—Back to the Future 3. Like Godfather 2, Back to the Future 2 worked hard to explain the cause and effect behind the original. In Back to the Future 3, they had Michael J. Fox for a couple extra months, so they put a cowboy hat on him and waited for the money to roll in. To their great credit, Pixar has created a Toy Story 3 that is true to the original, but that has its own story, one that expands on the earlier films with a new message of not living in the past. I knew Pixar had not failed when the opening scene—a spectacular action sequence reminiscent of Back to the Future 3—was quickly left behind and supplanted with a real human story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

The story is very good and the plot is very well developed. The animation as always is awesome and the soundtrack is also very good. The cast of voices is incredible. We have Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack and Don Rickels repeating roles as Woody, Buzz and Jesse and Mr. Potato Head respectively, but we also have new characters like Ken with the voice of Michael Keaton and Ned Beatty as Lotso the bear. In conclusion, Toy Story 3 is an excellent movie, entertaining and enjoyable and it leaves you a good message like ""you're never too old to feel like a kid"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Moved to tears,"This is the best ending to a trilogy!!! Pixar had done it again. I watched this movie when it came out and I was a pre-teen and didnt see any significance or feel very moved by it but thoroughly enjoyed it from the perspective of a pre-teen and now as a 20-something-year old, I cried my heart out watching this.The ending was foreshadowed in Toy Story 2 but Pixar created such a great storyline that it was impossible to say it was borrowed or recycled material. There was nothing negative about this movie. It was everything I hoped it would be with some really important lessons in it as well.After watching it I took out all the toys I packed away and hugged them all... it's difficult not to after watching it again and really feeling that childhood is officially over... or has been for a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Yea Toyyyyyy!!!,"I do sincerely apologize for being punfully playful in my movie review of the extra charming ""Toy Story 3"". Yes once again, I will be a Mr. Puntatohead! ""Toy Story 3"" is a room full of entertainment heaven. It is that good! I am not toying with you! This Toy story picks up when a grown Andy is preparing to leave to college, and unsure on what to do with his classic toys he has cherished throughout his past childhood. The same cast of Andy Toy characters are back; of course headed by Woody The Cowboy and Buzz Lightyear. But as the last Toy story, new toys are introduced to this story including a toy boy for Barbie, and that would be none other than Ken. The Andy toy family eventually end up in a day care center called Sunnyside, even though the toys end up being more scrambled than sunnyside up by a feisty group of toddlers. The so-called toy leader at the Sunnyside Daycare is a conniving bear called Lotso, who has lotso devious plans to hold the Andy toy entourage as prisoners. However, Toy Story 3's primary premises play more with the concept of the agony & denial of ""letting go"", and the togetherness of loved ones. Not to mention, the specialness effect that childhood toys could have on one throughout an entire lifetime. There were a few handkerchief moments in the teary story of ""Toy Story 3"". Academy Award winning screenwriter Michael Arndt scribed an exuberant and heartwarming screenplay which should present him a revisit to the Oscar red carpet. Director Lee Unkrich was precise with his handling of these toys, and the rest of the Pixar clan were once again terrific. And woodynt you know it, the vocal performances of Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz, and Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head were a thing of beauty! I especially liked Michael Keaton's vocal work as Ken. In no way, shape or form ""Toy Story 3"" belongs in the toylet. It is a classic tale that both children and adults will adore, even though some kids might not see a baby doll the same way again. The final buzz is that ""Toy Story 3"" will live in all us for infinity and beyond. And that truth is not light years away! ***** Excellent",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Emoshuns,"Sucks that I can't pretend this is actually the end of the series anymore.Cause it's a great ending. It wraps up everything the characters had going on pretty much flawlessly, and I don't know if I can think of an ending more bittersweet than this.But you all know that the ending is great, so I'll go on about the beginning and middle instead. It's well directed, the animation is great, voice acting is amazing again, and christ does it bring the Emoshuns.My beef with this one compared to Toy Story 2 is that there is quite a bit of rubbish that is extraordinarily convenient or inconvenient that only happens to move the plot along, and while I don't consider any of it especially jarring, I feel like it's at least worth a mention, because there's a lot. A lot more than either of the first two films.*Spoilers Start*Buzz's Spanish mode is really dumb, even if it is funnyMrs. Potato Head somehow figuring out that Andy didn't mean to throw them out just from his gestures that she caught at a very convenient timeThe ridiculous logic of the magnet at the endBloody hell how has no one in this world realised that toys are alive yetNot really a spoiler but good god is Barbie and Ken's relationship very stop and start, also Ken is definitely a frequent poster on r/niceguysand other things of that nature.*Spoilers End*So no, I don't like this as much as the second, but it's absolutely still essential to watch if you did like the first two.Unlike, I suspect, the next one...",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
It's time we bowed down to Pixar and stopped slamming their films as Children's flicks,"Pixar, it seems, have seriously become a force to reckon with. It all started with Toy Story in 1995 and since then, they've consecutively delivered masterpieces after another as if to virtually remove all doubt that Toy Story was a fluke (and no, it wasn't one). The next in line is Toy Story 3 which, quite easily, joins the ranks of Pixar's finest movies (though I'm now struggling to recollect which one wasn't).In Toy Story 3, we see that Andy is about to move to college. He has to pack up his toys in the attic, donate them, or trash them (that's the choices he has). While he decides to go to the first option, the toys, through a series of misadventures land up in Sunnyside - a place where they'll have plenty of kids to play with them. But all is not as well as it seems since the kids are far from what Andy was when he played with the toys - they thrash them, mercilessly pound them and mess the toys up - enough to make the toys decide to go home.The best thing about Pixar movies (despite the fact that they're animated movies) has been the characters - something which other movie makers need to learn. Although Toy Story 3 excels in almost every department, the characters are never lost in the background. We still care about the likes of Woody, Buzz and Jessie which is surprising considering that we know they're just pieces of toys. And the voice acting is just incredible. I thought Tom Hanks would have lost his form after all these years and was wondering whether, despite aging 10 years, he'd be able to voice Woody with the same enthusiasm he did back in the previous two Toy Story movies. However, he does a brilliant job at it and so does the rest of the voice cast. It'll make you feel as if the voice recording for the movie was done 10 years ago.Technically, the film features CGI which is amazingly impressive. There are times when you simply forget that this is an animation movie you're watching. In fact, just like in WALL·E, the only times the CGI looks CGI is when humans show up (which is perfectly understandable given that it's incredibly difficult to make human CGI). Watch the opening sequence to get what I say, it alone is enough to convince anyone of the visual superiority of this movie. Cinematography and Editing are also flawless, the movie never slows down and it feels that there's something constantly happening in the movie. Humor is again good - especially the scene in which Buzz turns into Spanish mode. Hilarious !!Just like it's predecessors, the most amazing feat of Toy Story 3 according to me is how it makes you emotional and sad towards it's end. It's a perfect example of directorial triumph. And this happens at a time when the characters in the movie just exchange glances at each other, they don't even speak much in that portion of the movie. It's strange to realize you'd become sad by just looking at toys without they saying anything. Without revealing anything all I can say is that the first thing you're likely to do after watching this movie is go home and check out your old toys. You're surely going to miss them - at least I did.My only gripes with the movie - I'd have loved to see more of Rex, Hamm and Slinky Dog. Rex's lack of confidence is something which came across as wonderfully in the first two movies. That is something that I missed. Also, the humor is less stronger as compared to the first two movies and so are the dialogues. Those are my thoughts. These tiny nitpicks shouldn't deter anyone from watching this movie. And yes, the 3D was simply pointless. I actually wanted to watch the movie in 2D but couldn't since all major movie screens are showing it in 3D. That made it clear that the 3D was more for the purposes of generating revenue than for anything else.And yes, it's time we accepted that these movies are NOT movies for Kids. They can be enjoyed equally by Adults as well - in fact more so. It's high time people stopped slamming these movies as movies for the kids and skipped them. If you're one of them, you're missing out on something really important here - something you'll regret 10 years from now for sure.

High Intensity - But Still a Good Movie,"Possible Spoilers This movie follows much in the formula that Pixar laid out in the Toy Story 2. If you saw that movie, you've seen much of this movie. That said, Toy Story 3 was more intense, which will appeal to some of the audience, but not to all. It has a more pronounced set of bad guys, than any other Toy Stories and some might feel they were not good for the target audience, but they served to make the movie more intense. It presents some of the same themes that were introduced in the prior Toy Stories, but the movie also answers a nagging question that has come up throughout all of these Toy Story movies - What happens when Andy (The Toys' owner) grows up? All in All it was a good movie experience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Toy Story 3: Awe-Inspiring, Perfection. Unforgettable. Take your pick.","In this day and age in the world of film, more often than not, sequels and trilogies end in massive disappointment, and sad efforts to stretch the profit of the preceding ""hit"" movies they once were. But, this movie IS the exception to that time. This movie, undoubtedly to its viewers, stands the test of time for possibly the greatest animation movie, not to mention trilogy, of all time.With the profit and well execution of the the original Toy Story, which in itself deserves monumental note, and the well added Toy Story 2, the third and final chapter of this beloved story was inevitable. The question arose, as it always does, ""will this movie be as good as the rest?"" or ""will this ruin the other two?"" But the answer to those questions were answered with the exact opposite of their expectations. This movie made them BETTER. After two screenings (one in 3D and 2D), and the reviewing of the rest, I stood a movie lover of all genres, giving respects to Disney and Pixar in gaining my respect as one of the best executed film franchises, ever. For so many reasons.People who see these movies and who consider the ""greats"" of all time to be the groundbreaking classic films such as ""Shawshank Redemption"", the Godfather series, Apocalypse Now,and so on, movies with built in audiences or movies that just break the norm of the films at that time. But when breaking down the classic movie goals, hitting all ages and audiences, providing multi-genre platforms, and in the end the heart and love and meaning that all films should posses, this movie conquered them all. Movies that take the approach of the tear-jerking, emotional endings to add purpose to the movies message, are in no way deserve disrespect or demeaning; many films execute this well. Toy Story 3 executed it with perfection. Sense I do not believe in spoilers and wont go into deep detail, this movies approach to that concept was one that once again, ALL can relate to, all can be moved by, and isn't that what movies are all about? Taking you on a journey to find something or some meaning in life's impossibly foreseen antics? And at the same time, enjoy it, laugh with it, and take it as it is. Woody and the gang will do that for you, as they have time and time again. If there is one thing that I urge with the purpose of this review, is for those who fade away from such seemingly child based movies for there supposed childly audience and performance, to ""reach for the sky!"" to step down from that position. Open your mind and heart to the love and world of imagination and the world of love that this movie has considerably. For anyone who has ever had to leave something they love behind, for anyone who had to grow up when they didn't want to, for anyone who has ever had to fight for something they loved and believed in, and for anyone who needs happiness to shine once again; you need to enjoy this historic and without a doubt one of my favorite films and trilogies of all time- Toy Story 3.And remember-No matter where you go in life, you'll always have your best friend.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Great,"I don't love 'Toy Story 3' as much as its two predecessors. That doesn't mean that it isn't anything other than great though.I enjoy the bountiful humour and intriguing plot, while the newly-introduced toys are very good. If I had to nitpick, I don't massively like Lotso, who kinda feels to me like a slight copy of The Prospector from the 1999 sequel - with the difference here being he's the ultimate antagonist, perhaps too villainous for my own personal taste. As I said though, just a tiny criticism in the grand scheme of these productions.Tom Hanks remains on top form as Woody, as do all the others including Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and Jessie (Joan Cusack). Ned Beatty does a terrific job as Lotso, while Barbie and Ken are brought to life well by Jodi Benson and Michael Keaton.Once again there are some excellent scenes, with the ending also being entertaining just like in 'Toy Story 2'. There's also a lot of heart in the concluding scene. I'm surprised they did a fourth time, even if I do agree it's still a very good new instalment.Pixar and Disney keep up a pretty remarkable high quality, even in the third film of the franchise.

"The movie to convey Pixar's timing and greatness is in ""Toy Story 3""!","Reminiscently, this movie banks a lot of that for me, personally, as I grew up with the first set of Toy Story movies. But to see it again at the age I am now was just fantastic.Pixar just knows how to make their movies golden, in terms of legacy. Toy story, however justifies this. The movie takes place with Andy going to college. It's sad to see this happening, but yes, that's the story line it's based on. So the toys are going to be obsolete and unused for all of eternity (so they think). When Andy places Woody in his bag preparing for college, he leaves his other toys (Jessie, Rex, Hamm, Buzz and all the other toys), but places them near the attic so they can be put up there.The way everything clashes together is really tense. How Andy's mum mistakes the toys for garbage, then throws them away. But everything's blown out of proportion when Woody tries to save them, then they get taken to Daycare, that the toys prepare for intentionally as they think that they are better of at least being used, than being garbage (but that has a twist that they never realized).It's said that Lot'so Bear was a prototype for Pixar that the company were building up for, especially for this movie. Well he's brilliant! And everything works so well. Especially what secrets hides behind the Daycare as well as kids! It's hilarious also with the Spanish Buzz, Ken (Michael Keaton) getting mocked as a Girl's play doll accessory! Amazing stuff. I loved the nostalgic factor more than anything. The story, the voice cast, the laughs, the new toys... And admittedly this movie is very sad. Everything works so well, and for that it deserves 10/10!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Story telling at perhaps it's best.  And with toys.,"People made huge hype about this movie. I was pretty pumped at the idea of a third one when I heard about it a few years ago. However, as the last months closed I became more and more disinterested as I was reminded how weak the second one was. If you liked the second one, great. So did I, but I certainly dreaded one with the same pacing.I'd have to say that the only thing I really really disliked, was that the old cast seemed of just died off. I mean, seriously. Etch was in the friggin' first teaser! He's not even in the movie. I honestly felt lost without him. How cool was it to see Etch just scramble around and draw crap perfectly?! Well, not in this movie. Also some key players are also missing. R.C., Speak and Spell, and Boe Pete (Is that how it's spelled?) I didn't like that. The movie, like all the other movies takes us from one setting to another. Forcing the toys to learn some disturbed truth at the new setting and to figure out how to get out. All while trying to earn Andy's love and respect! I am not saying this formula sucks. It's great. It's easy enough for an infant to follow and allows enough entertainment for an adult to actually enjoy. However, the final climax was a bit lacking to me. And I felt like I had been there before.I am announcing all these bad things, because that's all that matters in a Toy Story review. WE ALL KNOW IT'S WORTH WATCHING! But which one is best? Certainly not this one. Not to me at least. Toy Story has the original charm, it's tough to beat. So tough that I doubt it can be beat. But this one beats the second one easily.So all in all, this movie is worth viewing in theaters. In fact, if you haven't, then you're simply not a movie go'er. This movie is well worth the time and money and for old school fans it will make you want to watch the first two over and over again and talk about all three movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Toy Story 3 is a blast of my young childhood memories.,"Toy Story 3 is a masterpiece and deserves Best Picture or at the least a nomination. When I was small I had a bunch of VHS tapes that I watched all the time. Two films I watched that give me so many good memories were Toy Story and Toy Story 2. When I wasn't watching movies I was playing with toys. Toy Story like toys was a big part of my childhood. Now they are back. All the voice actors (Minus Jim Varney RIP) are back and do a wonderful job. The best performances coming from the great Tom Hanks as Woody, and Ned Beatty as Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear. The old characters are great and so are the new ones. There should not be a sequel. I'm OK with shorts, but as for film it should be left alone. The feeling I got from it was like opening an old toy chest and looking inside and thinking of all the good times I had.

The Toy-est Story Ever Told,"The third and final installment opens with a bang and never lets go. Brilliant doesn't even begin to describe the emotional treasure trove that is ""Toy Story 3."" When he's off to college, intending to take Sheriff Woody with him, Andy wants to move the other toys to the attic but they eventually land at a children's daycare center where trouble awaits. What follows is a rousing, hilarious, heartwarming tale of friendship, reliability, and the fact that childhood - like it or not - will always be an intrinsic part of our being. Newly introduced characters blend seamlessly with the cuddly bunch we've come to know so well for the last fifteen years. Told with panache and a light hand for side gags that will please kids and grown-ups alike, especially - but not necessarily - in 3D.

Perfect ending for the trilogy,"""Toy Story 3"" was released 11 years after ""2"". This interval gives it a comletely different level of CGI technology from the prequel. But more importantly, it gives it a plot background. That is, the same amount of time has passed in the Toy Story world, and Andy is now ready to go to college.It was already suggested in ""2"" that Andy would grow and someday stop playing with toys, and it has become reality now. There are two options. One is to stay with Andy just as reminiscence of his childhood, and the other is to move to a day care center where random kids will play with them without personal bond. Woddy and other toys are divided over it, but even for us it is hard to tell which is better.Without knowing what kind of ending we will have, the film plunges into a very exciting escape action part. It involves interaction with daily goods like door knobs, windows, toilet paper, and laundry basckets. They are very pleasant to watch only when the materials, like plastic, glass, metal, and paper, are real.The plot take advantage of many cliches. A generous friendly old man turns out to be a villan. The villain has traumatic past, which is told by his old pal. The torture scene is like from a mafia film, and the furnace scene is like from a sci-fi action film. I don't know why they are so funny just because they are transformed into their toy versions.The main characters are as funny as usual. Each of them has their unique mental and physical characteristic. Buds is rigid and manly, and susceptible to brain glitches. Barbie and Ken are like a revival of the 80s pop culture. The dignified Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head play important roles with their ability to take off their face parts.And we finally reach the ending. This ending is totally satisfying after all. Even though I am an adult, or rather because of it, I couldn't help crying. It is the type of ending that reminds you of various scenes from the entire trilogy. And it means it is the ending for Andy's childhood.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"Not the best animated movie ever. It's one of the best movies ever, period.","I'm actually writing this after having finally watched the 4th movie, begrudgingly, but was still pleasantly surprised.I was 14 when Toy Story came out, and I played with so many of the toys in the movie, among them, Mr. Potatohead, the army men, and the T-rex.Toy Story 3 starts innocently enough, the hijinks get going, and then you get kicked in the feels not once, but multiple times. I recall being in the theater for Toy Story 3. I sat next to another guy who was with his 9 year old daughter. We were sobbing almost uncontrollably. His daughter was so confused lol.Toy Story 3 is not a movie for children that's geared towards adults. It's greatest trick, is that it's an adult movie about true friendship and bonds, but they made it about toys so that the kids would bite.Never has a movie moved me the way Toy Story 3 had. It broke so many stereotypes. A movie for adults that was animated. A third installment of a series that was better than the original, and a movie about friendship and disappointment with a meaning so deep that only adults could understand..... except it's a ""kid's movie"".

Toy Story 3 delivers...to infinity & beyond!!!,"This signature line from Buzz Lightyear, alone is enough to bring a smile and perhaps a nostalgic flash of the preceding two installments of this heartwarming saga but Toy Story 3 delivers a lot more than just that. From the first frame itself, the movie sets into sublime motion with one scene simply flowing into the other. The audience gets introduced to all the old familiar faces - the Potato Heads, Rex the Dinosaur, Hamm the Piggy bank, the aliens, Slinky the dog, Jesse and of course, Woody and Buzz Lightyear. Andy's all grown up now and headed to college and the Toys are left guessing as to their fate now that Andy won't be interested in playing with them anymore. Woody, always the loyal one, tries his best to convince them that Andy won't discard them, but the others don't believe him. What follows is another typical 'Toy Story' adventure with the toys experiencing the supposed thrills and chills of being toys to kids in a Day Care, imprisoned in what they believed to be their new wonderland and Woody, as always, is there to save the day. Toy Story 3 also brings to the fore a host of new characters including Barbie, Ken, Lotso and Big Baby to name a few.On the downside, the 3D of the movie..well let's just say it isn't there. After the magic that Avatar has created, the benchmark is probably set so high now that one wonders if any other movie would even come close to creating that level of realism. To expect that from an animation movie, no less, would be harsh but the sad truth is Toy Story 3 doesn't even attempt to impress in that department. One may as well watch the movie in 2D because the true magic of the movie is in the story and characters rather than the effects. Another disappointing factor was the dearth of humor in the movie..though, a couple of scenes do make you chuckle and smile.However, what really warms your heart towards Toy Story 3 is not the beginning, the action but really, the end. Knowing that Andy is now, indeed, too grown up to play with his old toys the movie ends on the best possible note, leaving perhaps a touch of sadness that this marks the end of a one-of-a-kind sagaFor those who are still trying to make up their mind, I'd say if you found anything good about the previous two installments don't bother your heads on this one - just go watch it. If you loved toys when you were younger, I bet this movie will remind you of your favorite ones, the good times you had with them and possibly a touch of regret if they aren't in the best of shape any longer.So go ahead, remember the good ol' days and bid farewell to one of the few trilogies that have lived up to the expectation...and beyond",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
All About Relevant Themes,"Besides the humor and crazy adventure, the thing that has really made the Toy Story franchise successful is its focus on very relevant childhood themes. In part one, it was the new toy (Buzz) challenging the viability of the old one (Woody). Part two is more of an origins tale. The trend continues in part three, this time dealing with the growing-up of toy owner Andy.For a basic plot summary, Toy Story 3 sees the toybox gang (led as usual by Woody the Cowboy and Buzz the Space Ranger) trying to deal with Andy going away to college. When some of the toys panic in thinking they will end up in the city refuse, they ""escape"" to a local daycare, where life seems to be fine. However, the idyllic daycare future (where toys always get played with) may not be as rosy as it seems, forcing the toys to make some tough decisions about returning to Andy or moving on with their lives.All the good stuff that made the franchise what it is today is present in this film: the strong lead characters, the wise-cracking ""peanut gallery"" of supporting characters, and the hilarious sight gags that will thrill both young and old. Also, the animation is slicker than ever (compare technology from the mid-90s to today and you'll get the picture), bringing the characters and their rich environments to live in even more vivid clarity.However, what really sets this film apart from other Pixar fare is its attention to themes that tug at everyone's heartstrings. The toys struggle with their loyalty to Andy (who has inevitably outgrown them) vs. their desire to still be played with (every toy's greatest joy). At times, you might wonder just why exactly you are misting end (especially towards the end) about chunks of plastic animated on screen, but then you'll remember: Because they DO mean something to you, as they share the same struggles as normal people. Unlike perhaps any other children's film franchise in history, Toy Story really creates an unbreakable emotional bond between ""actors"" and audience.If this is indeed the final chapter in the Toy Story saga (and the ending, while emotional, leaves some wiggle room for the future), it went out on the highest of possible notes. It will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and, perhaps most importantly: FEEL.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"The Toy-gang, 3D,  A Prison Break, A Classic Ending.","Toy Story was a movie that reintroduced Animated Movies to the mass audience, way back in 1995. Now 15 years later comes a movie when animated movies are plenty, most of them fail to charm us like they once used to and a time when sequels are rarely good as the originals.A few months back, I concluded(rather hastily) that this year no animated movie can beat 'How to train your Dragon' and was almost sure of it after seeing the latest Shrek. But then who would have though the good old woody-Buzz-and-the-toy-gang in their third installment would change all that with a gripping plot, brilliant graphics, right amount of humor and a superb ending that would make sure you will remember the toys for a long , long time.Andy, the kid had grown up to become a teenager.

Remembering the old days,"Do you ever get that nostalgic feeling of when you were a child? When nothing seemed too complicated and you felt loved? Toy Story 3 is an excellent movie with good pacing and well fleshed out characters in its own right, but what made this an above OUTSTANDING movie is that watching this reminded me of my 7 year old self feeling like i was on top of the world.The story line of Toy story 3 is nothing we haven't seen before. Much like the previous two, its about staying together as a family and coming back home. But as far as the story telling and presentation goes, this recycled story line feels fresh yet familiar enough to those of us who grew up with the original movies to feel at home.I cannot praise enough about this movie and i say its one of the few must see movies of the summer. Even if you don't like over priced popcorn and sticky floors, once the movie starts you'll feel right at home, wherever you were when you first watched the series back in 1997.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Toy Story 3: This Year's Best Animation,"With both of its predecessors receiving a 100% positive feedbacks on RottenTomatoes.com, Toy Story 3 is expected to reach the high standards. And it absolutely does. Toy Story 3 follows the 11 year absent of the two previous films and off the Andy going to college. The toys including Woody and Buzz Lightyear are being donated to a daycare center. The toys were ecstatic about it until they found out that the kids there are disgusting and there is a huge evil bear with a one-eyed baby doll guarding them. Adding adventure to the already interesting plot, Woody and the gang decided to humorously escape the center with great style. Director Lee Unkrich, who is not new at all to the Pixar directing department, he's been responsible for Finding Nemo, Monsters, Inc., and co-director of Toy Story 2. So picking him for the job is not a bad idea. He brought something completely new to the table and turned the story around with twists and thrills. Lee Unkrich had done a decent job of directing this beloved film which had both adults and kids crying their hearts out. From the beginning where Andy's home videos are being played to the end where Andy was saying his final good-byes to the toys, Toy Story 3 is a must-see for all ages and it touched all of our hearts one way or the other.

Pixar Can Add Another Masterpiece to Its Resume,"The long anticipated second sequel to Toy Story delivers what it promises: clever humor, vibrant animation, and a talented voice cast. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen voice the protagonists of Toy Story 3, who haven't changed much since the previous film. Owner Andy is finally heading off to college. He now must decide what to do with his remaining toys: donate them to a daycare, toss them out, or store them in the attic. Unfortunately, the toys face a misunderstanding and end up inside the daycare. There, they meet a bear who smells like strawberries and a charming male Barbie doll. Discovering that they are mistreated at the daycare, the toys plan a jailbreak for Andy's house. The movie is emotionally resonant and heartbreaking. Many people in the audience were in tears by the ending. The first two-thirds are hilarious and tense. Toy Story 3 is unpredictable and more tense than most thrillers these days.

A delightful tale that touches children and adults alike.,"It would be easy to say that once again Pixar has proved they are the best at what they do and other animation companies pale in comparison, because, well frankly, it's true. There's an unfussiness in how they make their movies, an effortlessness that allows the story to drive the visuals and not the other way around. Toy Story 3 is no exception. At its heart is a delightful tale that touches children and adults alike, utilising humour, drama and action to take us on an emotional, but by no means heavy-handed, roller-coaster ride that started way back in 1995.Whereas a lot of family flicks can be simply defined into the broader genres – comedy, adventure, etc – this trilogy closer isn't such a neat fit; it'll have you laughing, crying, scared, adrenaline-pumped and all without feeling uneven or unnatural. Pixar's expert balance between gags for the kids – the Spanish Buzz is downright hilarious – and knowing winks to the adults – the Cool Hand Luke homage is superb – is once again a highlight whilst the opening scene is a wonderfully clever one. A minor blip: the penultimate finale is a touch too frightening, the consequences are more malevolent than the rocket-blasting in Story 1 and the airplane-escaping in Story 2 earning an unwanted atmosphere of dread.These characters have affected audiences like so few can achieve. They've endeared themselves to us at such a high level that even in 2010, when the youngest fans of the first Story would be at least 20 y.o. today, there's still an enthusiasm and excitement to see old friends that is rarely encountered in the cinematic world. To the screenwriters' and filmmaker's credit, they don't just rely on the iconicity of Woody and Buzz to hold the picture together, instead taking the bold route of introducing new players – Lots-o-Hugs Bear, Barbie's Ken, Mr Pricklepants to name but a few – and not featuring previous characters such as Mr Wheezy, Zurg, Bo Peep and Etch-a-Sketch. The mix-up of focus and priority – Woody and Buzz share their majority portion of screen time with Lotso, Barbie arguably features more prominently than Jessie the Cowgirl – keeps the audience guessing whilst adding another level of freshness to the franchise.Not quite as flawless as the first film, this convivial instalment is still a must-see thanks to its winning screenplay, pin-sharp 3D animation and a tremendous voice cast that drive their highly-watchable characters.4 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Heartfelt Swan Song to Andy's Toys!,"From the ever-reliable purveyors of digital charm at Pixar, Toy Story 3 is a bona-fide summer delight loaded with action, humor, nostalgia, a veritable blizzard of pop-culture references and general good vibes. It is injected with humour and powered by fun as the adventures of Woody, Buzz and Co brings these toys together in ways that will entertain and move you.Andy is all grown up and about to drive off to college. His mom meanwhile wants his room cleared, leaving the fate of his toys uncertain. Fears of the unknown, of neglect and abuse, are gradually eclipsed by the threat of disposal. The whole gang gets caught in an odyssey of compounded indignities and the misunderstanding consigns the toys to Sunnyside Daycare, presented as a heavenly vision of constant, collective ownership and communal living. Alas, their utopia turns out to be a veritable penal colony, presided over by a tyrannical pink huggybear called Lotso (who makes a terrifically malignant bad guy) and his two henchmen, a bumbling lazy-eyed baby doll and Barbie's swishy soul mate Ken. It is here that our latest adventure begins.This time around, we get to see it all as the characters experience true peril (don't miss the brilliantly choreographed garbage dump incinerator scene), exciting adventure, genuine emotion, and the importance of love in one's life. What the film does so beautifully is to twist the existential crisis of a toy into a reckoning of our younger selves. It understands how we attach fond significance to those things that have been mute companions and witnesses through the years, and have measured our lost time. It is a poignancy that gathers such force by the end that your eyes, already moistened around the edges, will start teeming helplessly.Toy Story 3 hits every button from laughter to tears and lifts you up on waves of visual bedazzlement. Unflinchingly honest and genuinely moving, Toy Story 3 is a marvel, an absolute touchstone in movie history. Tag it as one of Pixar's best!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Love @ First Sight,"Life is all about moving on... and leaving behind the sweet inanimacies of our childhood in a box somewhere in the attic or given away or, worst of all, trashed. These are exactly the choices Andy faces when he packs up for college, and is given the responsibility of disposing his toys.The toys, in spite of being the same ones with which the trilogy kick started in 1995, have become more and more funny. Woody, his fellow deuteragonist Buzz Lightyear, and the ""others"" get ragged and tagged all over the city as they fight for another chance to be played with and loved.If you think that this is just another overrated movie, and the hype is not worth it, then you stand to lose out on one of the best movies you can watch in a theatre... :-P The laptops and those 'big' 22"" screens just wont cut it. Go watch it on the ""BIG"" screen. Its worth every paisa or penny or whatever currency you fancy.I'd like to congratulate PIXAR for producing excellence, yet again, and at the right time too, as we, who grew up with Andy, are nearly the same age as Andy, and may have moved over ToyStory if it were a bit late. Then there was another fear, fear of the film ""choking"" like most of the sequels ""choke"", and like Spain and South Africa ""choke"". Well... not only did it not ""choke"", but it flourished, and may manage to choke ""A-Team"" and likes.Funny, Insipiring, out-right hilarious, emotional and poignant.

This series is getting better with time.,"Most movie series tend to suffer from fatigue or mediocre storytelling as the movies progress through the years, that is not the case for the Toy Story franchise. This movie brings the series into new and uncharted territory, but still seems familiar and maintains the heart and compassion that is apparent within each other film in this series.I will have to put emphasis on the uncharted territory, as this movie does get a little dark and serious, but honestly, that is what gives this movie heart and soul.If you're a fan of the first two films in this series or have children, I would definitely recommend that you watch Toy Story 3 as it is arguably the best in the franchise.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
I love it.,"I loved Toy Story 3. It was really great. It lives up to the first 2 movies. In this adventure Woody and the gang wind up in a preschool after their owner Andy leaves for college. I loved the new characters including Stretch the purple octopus voiced by Whoopi Goldberg. The plot was pretty good, the characters were great, and the animation was so beautiful it just blows you away. The only thing that I was disappointed about was replacing Jim Varney with Blake Clark which I don't think Pixar should of done. They should of written Slinky Dog out but that's just my opinion. All in all Toy Story 3 was really great and lives up to the first two films. I recommend it for anyone. 10/10. Good job again Pixar.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

A fitting end to one of the best Trilogy's of all time.,"I grew up with the TOY STORY series, and I've always been looking forward to this one, ever since 1999. I've always has such a great fondness for the characters, and I'm happy to say that this is no exception. As soon as the movie started, all of my childhood memories came flooding back to me. My fondness of the series never really disappeared, but I do admit that I haven't really revisited the first two movies that much. I've been looking forward to the third installment for ages, but it was only until recently that my true love for the series returned, which was due mainly to anticipation. I'm sure that during TOY STORY 3, the smile never really left my face. It was so magical to see these characters back on the big screen again. As I was watching, all I could think about was how much I've missed these characters over the past 11 years. I feel so connected to this series, which was why I was fighting back tears on several occasions. I'm so glad I didn't cry, because I wouldn't have stopped. I'm proud of myself for keeping it together.The TOY STORY series has been there ever since I was 5 years old, and I've grown up with it. This film has seriously tugged at my heart strings. I found myself filling up at both sorrow, and happiness. I can't actually describe how brilliant the feeling was during watching this. To put is plainly, this film is absolutely beautiful. I adored everything about it.No word of a lie, this film is a perfect ending to one of the best trilogies of all time. I'm in two minds about the idea of a sequel. I would love to see the characters again, but on the other hand, the ending fits perfectly. I think it's best to leave it there. I'm just full of praise for this, it's near perfect.I only have one minor gripe about TOY STORY 3, and it's really minor. I wish Timothy Dalton was used more. That's it. The rest of the film is fantastic. I'm so happy that Pixar haven't messed this up. They've delivered a truly beautiful film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A long running franchise still manages to pull another fantastic cat out of the bag,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningWoody (Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and the rest of the toy gang still reside in Andy's bedroom in his old home...but he's grown up now and ready to move out to college, and the time has come for some of the toys to head up to the attic...and some to head to the trash! The gang find themselves, by default, in the ownership of a day care centre, which is in the grip of the seemingly kindly Lotso Lovin' Bear (Ned Beatty) who secretly runs a tyrannical control over everything there. Woody, Buzz and his love interest Jessie (Joan Cusack), must work together to save the day and say goodbye to Andy before it's too late.All good things seem to come in threes, and certainly, it would seem the best film franchises need to have a perfect three o to make themselves complete- Terminator, Godfather, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (?!?)...some even spoil it by veering into foursies- Lethal Weapon, Alien, Rambo...but three, as De La Soul once said, certainly seems to be the magic number. And, the third part to Toy Story has certainly kept a novelty in the bag...by making it a 3D experience, with the chance to see it in 3D glasses that hardly bring everything out right in front of your eyes, but illuminate it enough so that it stands out from any of the other films. Luckily, though, the more superficial stuff like that doesn't override the same charm and good writing that made the last two as bearable for adults as fun for kids.Not a massive lot really stands out, formula wise, from the other two films, other than perhaps a slightly veering slant towards less of a happy ending than a conclusion to what could either be a brilliant trilogy or a never-ending, soulless stream of sequels. As it does, it goes for a more darker, human edge to the characters and story, drawing us towards a genuinely thrilling, seat edge conclusion, that at first seems a cheeky homage to Arnie's demise at the end of Terminator 2, but in fact comes to stand alone perfectly as it's own great ending, before a sentimental, gushy final part that if it doesn't round the story off, at least sets it in stead for a new chapter.It goes without saying that the animation/graphics are all brilliant as ever, and that the geniuses at Disney/Pixar have done their thing to great effect once again. Truly, whatever they've already done and whatever they will do in the future, the Toy Story series will stand alone as one of, if not their best, achievement ever. *****",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
No one but Pixar can consistently make films this amazing.,"Pixar is my favorite animation studio ever, and they've NEVER let me down. Even their WORST film in my opinion Cars, was still a great movie). BUT, even with Toy Story 3's wide array of universal acclaim, I was still having doubts. Because third films usually turn out to be the worst, and I was having fear it wouldn't be that good...Aww, who the hell am I kidding?! This was my favorite of the trilogy, and only FURTHER adds to Pixar's long line of fantastic family films.11 years after the second Toy Story, Andy is now about to depart to college. He decides to leave some of his toys like Buzz Lightyear (Voiced by Tim Allen), and Jessie (Joan Cusack), in the attic where they'll be safe, and take Woody (Voiced by Tom Hanks) to college with him. However, the toys to be placed in the attic are mistaken for trash, and placed on the curb. Feeling betrayed and unwanted, the toys, along with Woody trying to convince the toys it was all a mistake, all climb into a box to be donated to Sunny Side day care. They meet up with the head toy Lotso-Huggin Bear (Voiced by Ned Beatty), who sets them up in the ""caterpillar"" room for toddlers. Woody breaks out to find Andy, but gets picked up by the daughter of a woman who works there, while the rest of the toys decide to stay. But, things get a little out of hand, and Woody must travel back to help the other toys break out.Now, the film isn't EXACTLY the same kind of feel as the first two. The film is directed by Lee Unkrich, taking over the helm from John Lasseter. Unkrich though, keeps the story going at a wonderful pace, and the film still features the same fantastic type of humor, action, and emotional heart to it. Be sure to bring plenty of Kleenexes for the third act.The voiceovers, as always, are brilliant. Hanks, Allen, Cusack, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, Estelle Harris, and John Ratzenberger are all fantastic in their returning roles. And there are also fantastic newcomers such as Michael Keaton, Timothy Dalton, Kristen Schaal, and Jeff Garlin, as well as others. I also want to give major kudos to Ned Beatty for his standout performance.The animation as always, FANTASTIC. It's absolutely gorgeous work, helped out by marvelous sound design from Tom Myers of Up, and Cars. The 3-D though, not that marvelous. I think I definitely could have lived without it. But, it doesn't hinder the movie whatsoever.It's a charming, hilarious, emotional, and satisfyingly worthy conclusion to a trilogy that quite literally has only gotten better with each new installment.All of these reasons are why I simply CAN'T give the movie anything less than an enthusiastic, **** out of ****",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

It delivers,"The story background is that Andy is going to college and is too big to play with toys but this is only the beginning of the journey for Woody and company to see what will be their destiny, do they move on or stay with Andy? Along the way, they meet interesting characters such as the cute, strawberry smelling bear that is not what he seems to be or the hilarious Ken or Big Baby.The story is specially hilarious in the first 40 minutes before it humanizes the toys and gives them a human story. There are funny moments throughout but they are mostly replaced in the latter part by poignant story and decisions that have to be made. The ending is particularly poignant and bittersweet since it is the end of an era and the beginning of a new one.I went with extremely high expectations and Pixar delivered. I'm undecided if this movie is better than the first one but it is definitely better than the second one. The 3D effects didn't really add anything to the story so if I were you, I would skip it and save some money.

A Ten year wait for one of pixar's greatest Movie series.,"Going back to 1999, i was 9 years old. when the prospector spoke of toy story 3, i was chomping at the bit waiting for it to come out. it finally arrived tonight. I was psyched like a little girl to see this movie.The producers aimed it at my generation, because i'm 20 now and people at my age grew up with the original toy story. but the producers were also trying to aim the movie at children (it is a children's movie, after all) but trying to aim at 2 different age groups is tough.The years have gone by and Andy is now 17 years old and on his way to college. The years have also taken their toll on the toys, as many of them have gone. Bo peep, Wheezy, Andy's room is near empty of children's toys. He has 3 choices for the remaining toys; They either end up in the attic, donated, or in the trash. They end up in an orphanage after a strange chain of events, and what leads is Cliffhanger after cliffhanger, with laughs in some places along the way.The Newspaper review said this movie was in one word, ""Bittersweet"" and that is true. While it is toy story and it's meant to make children laugh, there is a sob story written in that i wished wasn't there. the whole movie could've been funnier, and still include the ending with the moral of letting go. Again, the movie might be aimed at children, but the moral is really about growing up and letting go of your childhood. it's something Andy had to do, and it's something all of us older fans need to do at some point in our lives.8/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

You've got a friend in Toy Story 3,"When Pixar released Toy Story in 1995, the first in the studio's remarkable line of superior animated movies, not to mention the first fully computer animated film to ever hit the silver screen, I was five years old. Roughly the same age as the film's character Andy, the fun-loving and imaginative owner of the toys we have all grown to love. Now, after a triumphant sequel and several other wonderful Pixar adventures, Andy is seventeen years old and on his way to college. I myself am now twenty, and heading towards my junior year of college. It suddenly struck me just how personal the Toy Story saga was to me when i was sitting in the theater watching Toy Story 3 this afternoon. Woody, Buzz, and all of their plastic pals have been with Andy for as long as he can remember, and I realized that they have been with me for as long as I can remember as well. Needless to say this movie needed that extra personal touch to really deliver, and let me tell you that it did not disappoint. It is clear that Woody, Buzz, and Andy mean just as much to the Pixar crew as they do to you and I, and while Pixar has had several other masterpieces, this one may just define the Toy Story Trilogy as their crowning achievement.Like the first two films, Toy Story 3 pulls you into a world of pure imagination. The adventures these toys go on represent the fantasies of every five year old child. Ironically, it reminds us what it's truly like to be a kid again, even while the central conflict of the movie is the issue of growing up. And at the films core is a set of real life emotions and themes, touching strongly on the subjects of friendship, loyalty, and of course keeping that kid inside of you alive.The script of the film is hilarious, filled with gut-busting scenes that may have you rolling on the floors with laughter. But of course, Pixar never lets its audiences slide through a movie without introducing an intense level of adversity, and this movie delivers a level of suspense and drama that any adult film fanatic should be able to appreciate. To top it all off, the ending of the movie brought me very near to tears.Make no mistake, this is the film to see this summer. It's hilarious, exciting, adventurous, suspenseful, imaginative, heart-warming, and above all it reminds us never to let our imaginations die. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"Pixar (For Me) Is Now ""All Star""","I have many subjects to go on about this movie....But I would love to shorten them out a little. As for a 19, I still love the previous two that were released 11-15 years ago. I grew up on them, and I didn't think they were going to make a third. My dreams came true as this movie was released. Pixar absolutely knows how to touch our hearts with their movies. And that's what Toy Story 3 did. It's humorous, suspenseful, and emotional. Not to mention the Nostalgic Music they still kept from the previous two movies. This goes to show that movies don't need to be vulgar, and gory to be epic as this movie was. I don't want to spoil the movie (I won't) So, I'll just say this movie topped my favorite Disney's Pixar Studio movie list. EVERYONE should love this movie. There is nothing bad about it.

"Just as good as the other two Toy Story films, and that's saying a lot!","Since Pixar made the first Toy Story film in 1995, they have been consistently making beautiful and deep animated pictures, but in the last three or so years, they've really hit their stride. They've gotten down the emotion and the humor better than ever and Toy Story 3 just shows how brilliant the team at Pixar is, and how they've learned from their very few mistakes. Really a brilliant film company, and a lovely animated feature.Andy is now seventeen, and the toys are being neglected. In order to still be loved, all of them but Woody decide to be donated to day care. Woody escapes and ends up in a little girl's room, while the rest of the gang is tormented by the horrors of daycare and the scrutiny of the very evil ruler, Lotso Bear. A crime prison flick ensues.This movie, more so than any other Pixar film, jumps from genre to genre so flawlessly, and humorously. Drama, to comedy, to horror, and for a large chunk it was a prison escape film, and it was just as gripping and suspenseful as any live action prison escape film I've seen. Along with amusing dialogue and a captivating plot, the seamless genre jumping that Pixar knows how to work with makes their films never boring. And this film is really good at playing on every emotion. When it wants to be funny, it's funny, when it wants to be action packed and suspenseful, it is. The drama is on high too when it wants to be, and though this may not be as tear inducing as Pixar's last two outings, it'll choke you up all the same.The direction on this thing is fantastic. Each shot seems to be so expertly laid out, and depending on what the shot is, the scene is played a different way. Obviously this is true with any competent film, but it's noticeable here. To go with the direction, the animation is fantastic and the 3-D, which normally just adds a level of gimmickry, instead makes the animation all the more vibrant and the danger in the film all the more real seeming.Climaxes are always a difficult aspect of the film, because some people will feel it's too light a climax, some might feel the characters were never in any danger. This movie has a fantastic climax, where the danger feels as real as in any other film. The emotions are high, and the animation again makes this scene so beautiful, in both the surroundings and the character acting.Overall, Pixar has yet again made a masterpiece. They are so experienced at playing on real emotions and making things sad without being hokey, along with being funny and pacing a film. This is one more notch on their belt of perfection, and yet another destined classic!My rating: **** out of ****. 109 mins. Rated G.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
I've waited 11 years.,"I cannot say how truly excited I was to see this movie. I grew up watching Toy Story over and over and over again. I watched them back to back on Disney Channel (no matter how much I dislike that channel) and was sitting in my childhood again.That being said, I loved TS3. I keep hearing how it isn't for little children, and it really isn't. They haven't seen the first two. They wouldn't understand. And Pixar was smart to add in some darker stuff, because a lot of teenagers are going to see this. They grew up on it, just as I did. I found myself angry when a baby started to cry in the theater. Just because it's Toy Story 3, doesn't mean it's for the littluns.I think that, as far as series goes, Toy Story hasn't failed me yet and Toy Story 3 had me in tears at how wonderful it was. The ending made me as happy as could be, and now I want to sit with all of my stuff animals from my childhood and play with them as I used to.

If you want to watch it with more special effect, watch it in 3-D. i'll give it 10/10. Very recommended for all ages!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Maybe I'm a bit biased but...,"this was the best movie i've seen in a long time. I'm sixteen and have been waiting for this film for quite some time, so i had high expectations(woody and buzz pretty much raised me), and let me say that it exceeded them. Disney has not done well with sequels in the past, but the toy story movies keep getting better! Both the kids and the adults in the movie were laughing and(at some points) almost being brought to tears. The movie contained plenty of plot twists and surprises that it keeps you on the edge of your seat while making you feel warm and fuzzy on the inside. There's plenty of ""adult"" humour sprinkled throughout, so no one in the theater was bored. the only problem is that there were so many small children running about, it was hard to concentrate(but i did pay to see a children's movie). this film is great for all ages and maturity levels!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
To be a kid for one more day,"Everyone who is a member of Facebook knows about fan pages. Most fan pages are bullshit. Yet, there is one page that holds truths on so many different levels: ""move out of the way children, I've been waiting 11 years to see Toy Story 3."" Seriously, kids, we're not joking. Move. And if you don't move then at least do the impossible and shut up for an hour and 45 minutes. Honestly, that's how good Toy Story 3 is. You don't want to miss a single second.Toy Story 3, coming 11 years after its predecessor Toy Story 2, picks up the story of Woody, Buzz, Jessie and co. around 5-7 years later. Times have changed for the toys as their beloved owner, Andy, has grown up and is soon going off to college. The toys believe their two options are either being thrown out or placed in the attic, but receive what at first seems to be a pleasant surprise when they're brought to a local daycare center and donated. Soon enough, the toys find out that the daycare center, Sunnyside, isn't as happy and peaceful as a place as it's made up to be. In a nutshell, the toys face vast uncertainties and struggle to find where their place now lies.Anyone who even slightly knows about film can appreciate how difficult it is to create a masterpiece, never mind two. Yet, the staff over at Pixar seems to put them out left and right. Back in 1995, Toy Story became Pixar's first masterpiece. In 1999, Toy Story 2 became another and also one of the most well-received sequels of all-time. Fast forward to 2010, Pixar completes their trilogy masterpiece with the highly intelligent, sophisticated, energetic, emotional and fun Toy Story 3.On the foundation of the most recent masterpiece are the earthly themes which give the story its life. Toy Story 3's plot may be simplistic, but its subject matter challenges the viewer to connect with the characters. The toy characters (and the human characters) are given complex problems that the audience cannot help but get sucked right into. Built on themes such as togetherness and learning when to let go, Toy Story 3 is properly rated, but at the same time offers a ridiculous amount of maturity that's injected right into the heart and minds of its characters.The most impressive aspect of Toy Story 3, without a doubt, is its ability to pick up where it left off in terms of its plastic characters. Although each character is handled with delicacy, it's Woody who takes center stage with his near-human connection that he has with Andy. It is astounding how a simple animated film can produce such feeling of sheer love between a child (or young adult) and his toys. While Woody handles the brunt of the emotional load, Woody's supporting cast brings an enormous amount of life to the film and while it's obvious they've grown, they haven't changed. Audiences will also be treated to the introduction of several new characters, but none steal the show quite like Lotso, whose story is so complex and unnerving that it's hard to hold much resentment towards him and Ken, who, opposite of Barbie, more than fills the movie with humor.Ultimately, those who have grown up and stuck with Toy Story throughout are bound to love it. Toy Story 3 keeps its base characters the same and more than pays homage to its original. The film is rich in human emotion and those who are around the same age as Andy will have a hard time not relating to his feelings. The movie is an emotional roller-coaster and its final 20 minutes alone could be another to give this masterpiece its fresh rating. The ending of childhood is a bittersweet experience, but it's a movie like Toy Story 3 that understands. It's a movie like Toy Story 3 that gives people like me, 20 years old and in college, an excuse to toss aside any troubles and feel like a kid again, even if it's for less than two hours.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Toy Story 3 Blows the Doors Off of Every Disney/Pixar Movie Yet,"When I first discovered that their was going to be a third Toy Story, I was blown away. Toy Story was a groundbreaking movie and the second one was phenomenal. But the third, combined both and made it even more great. I went into the theaters having no idea what to expect, and nothing went the way I thought. Surprisingly, the film was gripping, and hilarious, epic even. I even shed a tear. If you saw Toy Story, see this movie. If you saw Toy Story 2, see this movie. If you didn't see Toy Story, see this movie. If you didn't see Toy Story 2, see this movie. If you've seen Toy Story 3, see it again.Disney and Pixar have outdone themselves and set the bar impossibly higher for future films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"It doesn't matter if you're young or ""old;"" whether you grew up with the films or are new to them; Toy Story 3 is movie magic at its finest and a winner across the board.","I must first ask my fellow IMDb'ers to excuse my abundance of sentimentality in this review, but as a twenty-something child whom has just returned from seeing this film, many emotions are coming to the surface.Like many whom probably rushed out to see Toy Story 3 on opening weekend, I grew up with the first two films. Toy Story came out during the perfect time in my life, while my connection with my own toys was at its most personal and passionate. The film touched me then in a way that not many animated films have since, or at least until Toy Story 2 came along in 1999 and warmed my heart once again. Now I'm 11 years older and have grown somewhat, physically and mentally, over that time.Despite Pixar's consistency to outshine any other studio in the animation department, I still found myself doubtful as to whether or not Toy Story 3 would appeal to me now the same way the first two films did when I was younger. I clicked ""Like"" to ""Move out of the way children I've been waiting 11 years to see Toy Story 3"" on Facebook, but I still wondered whether I would be moved. Yet once I found myself in a packed theater with some strangers and some of my best friends whom I've grown up with over the course of my childhood, I couldn't help but transport back to that same kid I was in 1995.Toy Story 3 is movie magic at its finest. Unlike many animated sequels that come out today (I'm looking at you, Shrek), this third chapter retains all of the charm and intellect from the previous films without ever coming off as cheesy or cheap. Almost all of the characters from the previous films return and although Jim Varney sadly isn't filling Slinky Dog's shoes anymore, Blake Clark does a great job of bringing the character back in a way that would make Varney proud.Pixar has stated before that they don't make sequels to their films unless they have a story that is on par with their predecessors and that's proved through Toy Story 3. There are moments in the film that will make you laugh, smile, cheer, and (yes) even tear up. It doesn't matter if you're young or ""old;"" whether you grew up with the films or are new to them; Toy Story 3 is a winner across the board.Pixar has certainly done it again, against all odds. If the past decade has been any indication, they'll only continue to captivate us with their cinematic magic. To infinity and beyond!

Better than the first?,"The truth is, they could've filmed some homeless guy taking a crap, slapped the name ""Toy Story 3"" on it, and it would've made money. From a marketing stand point, they had no reason to try at all. But, they did, and it more than payed off.Disney and Pixar have something hard to find in cartoon; respect for their characters. And often when this is had, it takes away many comedic opportunities. But this movie has the perfect blend, and is a perfect ending to my favourite movie series as child.There are so many small things, and so many big things, that I'd like to discuss, but you could probably see the movie several times in the time that would take me.As for the title, ""Better than the first"", it very well may be, but I find it hard to give impartial opinions to something I loved so much as a child. If I found out I had 1 hour and 43 minutes to live, I just might spend it watching this movie. I'm not lying when I say the scenes in the trailers are probably the worst parts of the movie.It barely loses that one star it does for these scenes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
flawless,i have literally grown up with the toy story movies and it was one of those movies that just touched my heart. when i found out that they where making toy story 3 i was as excited as could be and felt nostalgic and knew i wouldn't be disappointed seeing it and i'm glad to say i wasn't. seeing this movie was exactly like saying goodbye to my childhood and made me laugh and at the end cry. i couldn't picture a more perfect ending to my favorite childhood film of all time. i was pleased with all the knew characters and their complex backstory. it deserves to win all its nominations this year and would be surprised if it didn't.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pixar Perfect,"Pixar has done it again! I am a huge fan of Toy Story and this 3rd movie is even better than the other two.I loved seeing the old characters back as charming as ever and getting to know new ones. Tom Hanks is as always brilliant as Woody and Tim Allen brings a whole new dimension to Buzz Lightyear.The animation is superb. I really can't find anything to complain about in this movie.What could be more fun than getting to know old friends again, in a theater full of people who are laughing and crying throughout the whole movie.My children loved it and I got a kick out of seeing their enjoyment. I also felt like I took a journey down memory lane, as I was just a teenager when the first Toy Story came out.Nice work Pixar, I foresee some Oscar nods here.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
