"Not your typical ""superhero"" movie, but still good","I was lucky enough to go to a pre-screening of Hancock last night and I really enjoyed it. I don't understand all of the criticism this movie is receiving. Everyone take a second and realize this is not a Marvel or DC comic book superhero movie. Now think about that again. It is a different story entirely and has some very unique elements.Hancock isn't action packed. It doesn't have a Superhero vs. Supervillan plot. I would probably describe it as a character study of the superhero. I think this movie does a better job of addressing some of the issues (and vices) a superhero probably would have if they existed today. The biggest conflict in the movie is within Will Smith's character's attitude, not necessarily good vs. evil.I think much of the criticism I have read about is motivated by expectations that were not met, which isn't fair at all. If you watch Hancock with only the expectation of being entertained, you will leave happy. Its a good movie, don't jump on the bandwagon of not liking it just because you can. Give it a chance and take it for what it is, a July 4th action/comedy.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Classic case of great idea, mediocre execution.  Strong performances are marred by weak CGI and a lack of a central villain.","Will Smith. That's all you've got to say, and you're guaranteed a big opening at the box office. Well, from the looks of it, Smith also guarantees you at least a mildly entertaining film, which is what we get in his latest movie, Hancock. In the hands of any other leading star, Hancock would probably end up being a below average film. It's Smith's charisma, charm, and unwavering likability that ultimately save the film. He can make you laugh, cheer, cry, and even root for his character (who is a total ass, as he is reminded a number of times throughout the movie) no matter what kind of shenanigans he may cause.Hancock is not the generic superhero film and is probably one of the more ingenious ideas to come across a producer's desk in quite some time. To me, what it seems like is that the writers of the film loved the idea, started off extremely strong, and then began to realize that how hard it is to sustain a simplistic idea over the course of a full length motion picture (and it is because of this that Hancock is relatively short). The writers' plan to solve this problem is to throw in a totally unnecessary and badly handled plot twist to keep the audience guessing. The lack of a central villain also hurts the movie a lot. The character that serves as Hancock's enemy in the finale isn't even well acted. The person is laughable.This is an action movie, so it should come as no surprise to see well done and original action in the movie. However, I felt the effects could have used a few more weeks of polishing in the editing room. The camera is also quite crampy. I also have problems with the film's score, as it does not add an epic feeling to the film like it should have. I felt like something was missing in the climax of the film (which is not the end). The action scenes, while entertaining and original, were not long enough to engage the audience like say, The Incredible Hulk, nor were they as jaw dropping as those in Wanted.The film's strength rides on its three stars. Action veterans Will Smith and Charlize Theron both deliver winning performances as usual, and that should come as no surprise. Smith's charisma is enough to make anyone happy, and it's so easy to see why so many people love him. Theron is always a sight to behold (except in Monster, lol), and this film is no different. I enjoyed her performance the most, especially in the second act and the beginning of the third. Jason Bateman, who seems to be the bridge connecting the performances of Smith and Theron, is great as usual, and likable, marking a change from his recent turn in ""Juno"". There really isn't another performance to note, and part of Hancock's weakness is that there are really only three main engaging characters. It should also be noted that the kid who played Bateman's son was absolutely adorable.Hancock is the classic case of great idea, and mediocre execution. I can see this idea being remade years from now, and pulled off even better. It's not a fault of Peter Berg, the film's director, as the real weakness is in the screenplay, which falters after an excellent and wonderful opening act. It's not a bad film by any means, nor is it great. It's in between ""okay"" and ""good"".",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Brilliant idea and great idea, but a classic example of the first half being much better than the second","What drew me into seeing Hancock in the first place was its idea, which I found one of the most interesting for a film in a while. I am in all honesty not a big fan of Will Smith, but he has given some solid performances so I thought why not.I have to say that I didn't think Hancock was a bad film as such, it was somewhat underwhelming and I'm sorry to say I do understand the criticisms against it.Hancock does have a fair number of good points. It is stylishly filmed, with some well above average special effects, the music is dynamic and the directing is solid. The best asset about Hancock is the acting of the three leads.Will Smith is very commanding, with a lot of subtlety amongst all the wisecracks/gags that don't feel forced(ie.flying under the influence). Charlize Theron shows a glowing presence while also showing a sympathetic side, and Jason Bateman's dry humour contrasts perfectly too.However, Hancock is a very uneven film. I loved the first half, it was well paced, the script was witty and fresh and the scene where the titular character brings a speeding train to a halt as he can't be bothered to lift the car up from its path is one of the better and relevant scenes of the film.It is in the second half where Hancock is less than successful. Here the film starts to drag, the script becomes soapy and heavily melodramatic and the film has one of the daftest twists of any film not to have M Night Shyamalan's name on it.The story's tone isn't the only asset to feel uneven, the script is too, it has wit and freshness in the first half, but becomes mawkish in the second. I also felt that there were only three likable characters(Smith's, Theron's and Bateman's) and the others I barely noticed, with the villain especially flat.So all in all, an uneven film but not a necessarily bad one. 5/10 Bethany Cox",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Enjoyed,"A film I remember watching years ago, re-watched 2022, enjoyable. Obviously more than the first time as I've increased my score from 5. There have been so many superhero movies since this, it's come up in my estimations.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This isn't a great picture but it is clever and entertaining in a lot of ways. I recommend seeing it at least once,"Hancock (2008) is a movie I recently watched on Amazon Prime. The storyline follows an anti-super hero that often causes as much damage as good during his times of heroism. One day, when saving a struggling public relations expert, he gets the advice he needs. Hancock will partner with the PR guy to try and save his image while continuing to do good for mankind. This movie is directed by Peter Berg (The Rundown) and stars Will Smith (Men in Black), Charlize Theron (Monster) and Jason Bateman (Ozark). The storyline for this is fairly clever and well done. The cast is very well selected and Smith, Theron and Bateman all deliver their characters perfectly. The script and dialogue is very good, loved the head in the ass references throughout. The soundtrack is also very good. There are some great action scenes that insert the comedic content very well. This isn't a great picture but it is clever and entertaining in a lot of ways. I recommend seeing it at least once and would score it a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Go see it - it's not that bad,"*** MAY CONTAIN SPOILER ***I NEVER write on these opinion boards but I might start with this one. I felt as though I needed to stick up for the movie after reading all the horrible reviews. I went to see it on the 4th, mainly because the trailers looked entertaining and because I enjoy Will Smith. This movie is not at all what I expected. There is a surprising turn of events that I did not see coming. Will Smith, in his usual style, is quick, funny, witty, and charming and I thought the timing between he and Jason Bateman was perfect. If you are expecting to see a movie along the lines of Hulk, Iron Man, Batman, etc, don't go because you won't enjoy it. If you are going because you like the cast and are ready to be entertained for 1 hour and 20 minutes out of your life, then it is definitely worth the price of admission.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fix the final Act PLEASE!!!,"I also was at the test screening in Peoria AZ. The film was spot on for the first hour. Jokes were hitting left and right, Smith and Bateman displayed good chemistry, and the special effects, though not always finished, were eye popping nonetheless.Without giving it away, the final half hour was flat, straying from the comical nature that had preceded it and instead tried to get philosophical and introduce a week paint'by'numbers villain. I spoke with director Peter Berg after the film and he seemed fully aware of the issues relating to the final act. Hopefully the recent ""re shoot"" will polish up that last act, making Hancock one of the must see blockbusters of the summer. In the form I saw it; it still has a ways to go.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I guess some people just can't take a switch in tone.,"I've read a lot of the reviews here complaining about the film flagging in its final act. I respectfully disagree.Hancock is most definitely DIFFERENT in it's last half - it drops off the comedy significantly and introduces some fascinating superhero mythology that is almost like an ancient Greek myth in its context. It also introduces some pretty tense and violent moments that really made me wonder if they should be marketing it as the kid-friendly summer blockbuster that they are. However, both halves have their own merits - the first being the humour, and the second being the (almost tragic) origin mythos. I suspect if you are prepared for the switch in tone, rather than shocked when it arrives, you might enjoy Hancock as much as I did.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Unique take on the superhero genre with mixed results,"""Hancock,"" directed by Peter Berg, presents a fresh and unconventional take on the superhero genre. Starring Will Smith as John Hancock, an apathetic and often drunk superhero, the film explores themes of redemption and identity. Hancock's reckless behavior and public disdain set the stage for an intriguing character arc.The film's first half is engaging, driven by Smith's charismatic performance and the humor derived from Hancock's unorthodox approach to heroism. Charlize Theron and Jason Bateman also deliver solid performances, adding depth to the story.However, the movie falters in its second half. The shift in tone and the introduction of a complex backstory feel rushed and underdeveloped, leading to a somewhat disjointed narrative. The film struggles to balance its comedic and dramatic elements, resulting in an uneven viewing experience.While ""Hancock"" offers a unique premise and strong performances, it ultimately falls short of its potential. It's an entertaining watch, but its inconsistent execution prevents it from being a standout in the superhero genre.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Well, the first half was good...","Look, I have an idea. Let's make a Superman flick, but instead of everybody liking this Superman-like character, everyone could, like, hate him.Hmm.. interesting. But why would they hate him? Is he a villain or something?No, no. He is..well.. a jerk. He still catches bad guys and stuff, but he, like, insults people, creates a lot of collateral damage.. you know. A jerk.I like it, I like it. He's like a superhero dr. House or something, right?Right. Only less witty and more bitter. We can also make him a drunk.Well... I dunno if it would fly. Perhaps if we could get Will Smith to do the role. People dig Will Smith.I'm with you there. Will Smith, flying around, insulting people.. man, this will be great!Right. But we have to go with it somewhere, we can't just let him do superhero stuff while being a jerk, this would get old pretty fast. How about he somehow gets involved with a PR specialist, who will, like, try to improve his public image?Great idea!

Can we pad it a little?No! It's unpaddable! I even added a female lead as Michael Bluth's wife, it still only added about 5 minutes of the movie. Nope, sorry.

Think, think...how do we further the story along, put in, like, some kind of a twist...They are all dead or something?No, no.. how about..(scrib scrib.. hours pass)Hmmm... I don't think this will work. No chance.Why?Just look at it! It's stupid, insultingly illogical, and the ending.. it's horrible. Look, I've greenlighted Jaws 4, so I know what I'm talking about.But, but.. Will Smith.. Bluth guy.. maybe we can get Charlize for the wife...I know!

"The cinematography and Plot Lets The Film Down, But Still A Solid Attempt At An Anti-Hero Movie","Pros:
1. Both Will Smith (John Hancock) and Charlize Theron (Mary) give great performances.
2. The emotional scenes, with thanks to the acting and well-timed pauses, land with great effect.
3. The humour is fantastically dry and dark, which prevents the film from becoming stale.
4. The action scenes are well-choreographed and entertaining.
5. The CGI and special effects, aside from a couple instances, look great and still hold up 12 years later.Cons:
1. There are a plethora of really strange editing and camera angles which take you out of the viewing experience.
2. There are a couple plot-holes. For example, why did Red (Eddie Marsan) only take Man Mountain (David Mattey) and Matrix (Maetrix Fitten) to confront Hancock at the hospital, after it had already been established that most of the prison population was there because of Hancock?
3. During the action scenes, obnoxious and corny stock action music is played.
4. The movie doesn't focus enough on the philosophical reasoning behind a superhero negating their duties, and whether or not they should have free will to decide their superhero role.
5. The entire sequence featuring Hancock and Mary fighting in LA not only has the worst looking special effects, but the conflict just feels really forced.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A good idea... poorly executed!,"Hancock began life as a good idea and with a very intriguing premise; it bills itself as the alternative superhero film by aiming to show that the Superhero can be humanized. The film centers on a down and out alcoholic superhero called Hancock, played by the ever impressive Will Smith. He is a superhero that causes destruction and fuels his own public hatred where ever he goes due to his lifestyle and his indolence. It becomes fortunate therefore that one day he should save the life of PR man (Jason Bateman), who is married to the lovely Mary (Charlize Theron) and that in return for saving his life he chooses to help Hancock change his image.The film starts well by introducing us to Hancock asleep, scruffy and unshaven on a public bench but ultimately establishing him as a lousy, grumpy oaf. As the film progresses Hancock evolves into a very endearing character, his apathy and self loathing - exhibited by his alcoholism, are all traits that manage to humanize the myths that surround super human beings. The fact that his physical prowess and lifestyle choice is his undoing is an interesting concept and in some quarters would be regarded as a microcosm of the manner in which gifted, black American men have been marginalized over the years (but this is a short review and I don't want to get that deep... however, examples that come to mind, and help to support this theory, are such great physical talents like Ed Moses, Shaquille O'Neil, Carl Lewis, Jesse Owen etc) some film scholars will no doubt give more precedence to this side of the film.Many critics have labeled the film as being unequal and disjointed and I would have to say that I agree. The first half of the film is amusing, engaging and quite plausible (given its premise) but upon the introduction of a second hero with equal powers the film quickly descends into the farcical. For example, some of the early scenes have Hancock exhibiting his strength in often mundane scenarios from dragging a car up a driveway to dunking a basketball from over 50 meters away but given there placement in the context of the film they are clearly the conceivable actions of a super strong human being. During the latter stages of the film this demonstration of strength becomes inane and coarse, epitomized by a scene in which the two superheroes battle it out the sky, throwing each other across blocks and through buildings, and affecting the weather to such an extent that lightening, twisters and snowfall all takes place. This is ultimately where the film falls down as it resorts to the clichés that are so often witnessed in films of this genre. Ultimately this decline is driven by a foolishly executed back-story that has no place in the film and should have been erased the moment it was conceived. The internal logic of the film is preposterous and nonsensical and would remain so even if it was chief plot device in a Saturday morning kids cartoon.When it comes to the direction it seems surprising to me that Peter Berg should be able to make the leap to making a blockbuster like Hancock, this is because Hancock was always going to be a commercial risk given its target audience and release date and his previous film The Kingdom was not a huge success. In these situations it is normally an established director that is chosen by the studio to carry films of this nature. This is evident from the manner in which the plot, story and narrative transpire to the screen as Berg's direction is gritty, with frantic zooms, sharp fast-pans and steady-cam sequences. His direction does not really complement the film, leading me to believe that in Hancock we have a director that is better than the film he is trying to make, a rarity in film making but it does happen.Finally, Hancock is probably one of the biggest let downs I have had the misfortune to witness this year. The incoherent story has seriously affected the outcome of this film; it has led to it being almost incomprehensible. The futile subplot and unnecessary twist laid the foundations for the films demise. However, despite my immense disappointment I can still sit back and take light in the performances and the direction, but they can do nothing for my overall feelings towards Hancock.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hancock Signs Off,"It isn't fair to write a film off in the first few minutes but you can sometimes get a pretty good sense as to what you're in store for from the way the film introduces itself. The film opens on an L.A. freeway, where four punks are being chased in their van by countless police cruisers while they fire their semi-automatic weapons into the air. Where's Spider-Man when you need him? (Right, I forgot  Spidey's a New Yorker.) Cut to a passed out bum on a park bench. Who is this man? Of course, we know it's our hero, Hancock (Will Smith), because we know a thing or two about the film before sitting down to watch it. Director, Peter Berg, takes this for granted though and it soon becomes apparent that convention and presumption will drive this unconventional tale. In HANCOCK, Berg, and Smith team up with writers, Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan, to debunk superhero iconography as well as the genre itself. The goal, and a noble and exciting one it is, is to rip the superhero out of the sky, strip him of his glory and send him hurdling toward the earth. Only Hancock is pulled down to an earth that is an awful lot more like a movie than the world I know.It wouldn't be so terrible to set this enormous Hollywood action film in typical scenarios if Berg weren't trying so hard to give the film a decidedly un-Hollywood look. The aesthetic is often shaky and unstill, crossing back and forth between odd close-ups and frames finding their focus. Berg seems bent on giving HANCOCK a gritty, guerilla film-making tone but the erratic style is at odds with the predictability of the plot. The borrowed independent style works in its original context because independent films are, ordinarily, about something deeper. Removing the gloss from a Hollywood feature only allows the viewer to see how little there is underneath it all. In HANCOCK's case, the man beneath the lacking luster is a reluctant hero who would rather waste his days drunk in a dive than diving into the action itself to save the day. There is some loose discourse on realizing your destiny but little else. Again reluctantly, Hancock agrees to some help from a struggling public relations person (Jason Bateman) and is set on the path to making the most of his life and abilities. Hancock is such a complex character (lonely, disinterested, depressed) that it would seem ripe with possibility but this is mostly squandered in favor of half funny humour and sometimes hokey special effects that it feels at times like a over produced Nike ad.Luckily for HANCOCK, the film is still somewhat enjoyable thanks to the strong performances of all its leads. Smith continues his streak for picking complicated characters with broad appeal and he also continues his streak of pulling them off. After a heartbreaking turn that pushed his dramatic abilities in THE PURSUIT OF Happiness and his commanding yet vulnerable turn that pushed his presence in I AM LEGEND, Smith plays a character we don't ordinarily see him as. His impossible-not-to-like face is covered in stubble and his physique is hidden by baggy, dirty clothes but his eyes are what give away his disenfranchised soul that shows his hurt for being shunned by society and disinterest in placating to that same society. Smith is joined by the modern master of comedic timing, Bateman and Charlize Theron, as Bateman's wife, who is simultaneously frightened and intimidating. This trio of talent is HANCOCK's salvation. Their grasp of their characters in unfailing and they pull the elements of the film together despite how flimsy the elements are to begin with.HANCOCK is occasionally astounding but mostly mundane. Above all, it is a disappointment. This original premise has been sloppily slapped together and most of its potential was squandered in the process. It didn't show me that superheroes are people too. If anything, it just made me miss the real deal. If the goal was to truly bring the superhero down to earth, then there was still a long, long way to go before this guy would have touched the ground.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Rise of A Fallen Alcoholic Superhero...But He Isn't The Only One,"I wasn't expecting anything great from 'Hancock' and I was really hoping that it wouldn't be another cheap-humoured 'Men In Black' type movie. What really got me to watch it was the curiosity of how Will Smith, Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron (loved watching the two on 'Arrested Development') work together. Now, i must say that I was pleasantly surprised. 'Hancock' certainly turned out better than expected. It has all the ingredients of a successful superhero film. What we get is sheer entertainment. There's a lot of action, drama, romance and comedy in it.Yet, it's not exactly among the best superhero films and what really makes it work are the three leads. I thought Will Smith would replay his 'Men In Black' persona but what we get is a nuanced performance. 'Hancock' is an alcoholic, depressed superhero who does the usual superhero stuff albeit in a very clumsy way and is not careful (nor does he care) to avoid collateral damage. As a result, people see him as a super-nuisance rather than a hero. But, there is a reason why Hancock acts this way. He's angry and he's upset. I won't say more except that Smith brilliantly displays the layers of his character. The eternally hot Charlize Theron (that is, if you forget 'Monster') springs a surprise. At first glance, I thought she'd be the typical wife who at in the beginning dislikes Hancock but gradually grows to like him. But no, it's something else and this becomes more apparent as the chemistry between Smith and Theron strengthens while Mary's attitude gets more curiously awkward. Yes, Theron is fantastic and shares an excellent on screen rapport with both her male co-stars. Jason Bateman's Ray is the suitable link between Theron and Smith. His camaraderie with Smith is very amusing and his scenes with Theron are nice to watch. Sadly, Eddie Marsan is awful as the villain and this is mostly due to poor writing.'Hancock' has quite a few flaws. The execution is not of top quality. The special effects are poorly done and look unpolished. CGI has greatly improved throughout the years but 'Hancock' is no proof of that. As a result the action sequences look fake. Nor is the background score any great and this really takes away from the slick feel one gets from an action film. The screenplay is faulty. It's a very short movie and the writers seemed to be in a hurry as the twists seem really drastic and at times rushed. I would have liked to see more plot development. The villain character is terribly written and has little significance to the overall story. The film starts off as a comedy and then moves to drama followed by romance and then action. Nothing wrong with that but perhaps a little more balance could have helped. Yet, this one is only a minor quibble.To sum it up, 'Hancock' is very entertaining and a good enough flick. But it could have easily been one of the greatest films of the summer. It is Theron, Smith and Bateman who lift this movie from being an average to below average flick. They make it worth the watch.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""It's you! Handjob!""","The moment I saw the preview for Hancock, this just looked like the most ridicules movie that could be made, I was sure that it was going to flop or get horrendous reviews. But after talking to people who saw it, it was half/half of either they loved it or hated it, so I guess this was just a movie I had to see for myself. So I watched it yesterday, I am dumbfounded, I'm the half/half, I loved it and I hated it. I felt like the beginning was just silly and rushed, not to mention that the villain was just under developed and didn't have any depth to why he was so bad. But however, I did like the little twist they had, which I refuse to give away, even though I did predict it sadly, it's one of those things you'll have to see. But I also did enjoy the originality, it's not just a typical super hero movie with all the stereotypes, it was John Hancock(which by the way should've taken place in Chicago after it's famous building).John Hancock is a homeless bum who just has a bad attitude along with a horrible drinking problem, he also is different, he is a super hero. The only problem? He causes a lot of damage when he ""saves the day"" and doesn't care what people think. But when a failing advertiser, Ray Embroy, is saved by John, Ray offers John a chance to look good and be the ultimate super hero. But Ray's wife, Mary, isn't so excited and has a little secret about her and John. But Ray is determined and will make sure that Hancock is a great super hero for the whole city.Hancock is over all an alright film, it's not bad by any means, but I feel like it could have been so much more with a better script. Not to mention some of the camera angles were a little extreme, there were times where I thought the cameraman was on a tilt-a-whirl and I felt sick. But for the story I'll admit that it was original and fun at times, Will Smith is a good actor, I will always admit that, but it seems like his movies(which are always released around the fourth of July, you notice) have become like a love letter to him and how great he is. Hancock is worth the look, but I'd recommend the rental, it's just a notch under a great blockbuster.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hancock a fun and thoughtful action-comedy with Arrested Development references(?),"i saw a press screening of HANCOCK this week and I enjoyed it. At first it starts out with some typical hokey action-comedy, but then it starts getting 'serious'. I agree that there might be some imbalance of tone on occasion, but i liked the seriousness combined with big action, humor and a great message.Some of the cgi work looks a bit too cartoonish and the movie could probably benefit from less of the typical 'comic hero' elements in regards to costuming and certain plot elements, but overall it's a cool movie.If anyone is an Arrested Development fan, you might notice some odd visual references in Hancock (other than the fact that Bateman and Theron are in this movie). I wonder if any of the filmmakers are somehow connected to the show.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Okay, but a mixed bag.","John Hancock is not your normal superhero. He's a drunk, hated by everyone for the damage he causes and is being sued. However, when he rescues PR man Ray Embrey, Embrey takes it upon himself to make Hancock popular with the population, despite resistance from Hancock himself, and Ray's wife Mary...Hancock has an interesting idea but the problem with it, is it can't sustain the entire movie. Partly this is also due to the fact that the part of heroes being unpopular with the people, and being sued for the damage, was better used in the Pixar movie, The Incredibles. So the idea doesn't quite carry the movie. As a result, a second plot thread is introduced. I won't reveal it here, but when it happens, you get the feeling the filmmakers needed something to keep the movie moving, but it's too contrived and doesn't really work, and is also never really resolved.Hancock's other main fault is that the so-called villains of the movie, aren't really that threatening. So any dramatic edge is lost in the climax of the movie. What also doesn't help is that it can't decide on what it is. The first half of the movie is pretty funny. The second half more dramatic. It's like they changed their minds about what kind of movie they were making halfway through.But it's not a total loss. Thanks to excellent performances from Will Smith, Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron and helped by an okay script from Vince Gillian and Vincent Ngo it is funny (especially in the first half of the movie). And director Peter Berg does well with the material.The visuals are pretty good, if not spectacular, and the movie runs at a good pace. I just wish they could have decided which way to take it.Is it a comedy? A summer action movie? Superhero spoof? By trying to be all things, it ends up being a bit confused, and it suffers as a result.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

About a superhuman who is just very human,"Hancock was a pretty interesting as well as entertaining movie. It definitely wasn't your typical superhero movie; and it wasn't originally a DC or Marvel comic. It's more about what would happen if someone with superheroes was around in modern times, and that is what makes it interesting. If there's some property damage done while catching criminals, people will be angry; if a vigilante has a bad attitude, people will be angry. I suppose Batman explores some of that not being liked by the public, as well as the bad attitude and personal trauma of the hero, but I found Hancock to be quite original in its handling of these issues. I liked the media attention and the use of sunglasses as a ""mask"" of sorts. I really liked how Hancock progresses as a character, and I liked the other characters as well. Usually little kids in movies annoy me, but the son of the supporting character was pretty cute and endearing. This isn't really a hero movie where there is a superhero and a super villain; I think it's more about what it means to be a human and relate to other people, to do good things and the desire to be accepted.

The police, public and civic officials wished he remained a barfly.Things change when Hancock (Will Smith) saves the life of Jason Bateman, a Public Relations expert who wants be a corporate do-gooder and wants to revamp Hancock's image even if it means doing a stretch in jail because of his various misdemeanours.Bateman is married to Charlize Theron who remains cool and suspicious of Hancock but something is drawing them together.The premise of an inept and drunk super hero has some novelty as we see him become a better and more sober superhero who the kids eventually look up to but this does not keep the engine of the movie going.The sub plot involving some bad guys intending revenge is minor as they will never realistically be able to challenge Hancock leading to some plot contrivances involving the weakening of his powers.Yet the film is not over-long, moves at a good pace. Despite its edginess and some bad language even younger kids will find it enjoyable and funny.The film does have plot holes the more you think about it afterwards as to where Hancock came from and the amnesia is a convenient plot point.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
There is definitely potential,"I don't know what to think of this.On the one hand, I watched it by myself and thought it was a surprisingly unique take on superhero tropes, and that's kind of impressive in a pre-MCU era, but on the other, I talked about it with some friends who also watched it, and I couldn't really disagree with them dunking on it.But let's start with the good. Firstly: Will Smith. Typically, you don't see an egotistical alcoholic and think he'd be good in that sort of role, but I have to admit he made it believable at the very least. He's certainly a little too one-note, but I do totally believe that he's completely alone, bored, and fed up with his life.In fact, the acting in general is better than you'd think a film like this would deserve. And - sue me I guess, but I did like the story that was given to me. Looking back on it now, I can't deny it would have been more interesting if they had stuck to their guns in the second half instead of trying to awkwardly make it about Hancock's past coming back to haunt him, because it does kind of run out of places to go at around an hour in and falls back on cliches, but while watching it, for some reason that just didn't occur to me. I wouldn't call the second half bad though.This is also an admittedly ugly film, for some reason it's shot like some kind of gritty action movie or war drama, and the effects are terrible, while there also aren't that many particularly memorable shots.But there is some great dialogue, a few honestly amazing scenes, and above all else, I don't think anyone can deny that this film is...unique.And even though it gets messy later on, I think a big reason I didn't notice while I was watching it is that it doesn't feel unsatisfying because of that. The sharp turn the narrative takes in its second half is more due to Hancock's character arc already being complete, rather than them just forgetting about it.It still could have been way better had they just...not done that, but I maintain this is still interesting enough to warrant a watch, even more so today than in 2008, probably.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
not bad but could use some polish,"The idea of Hancock is a fun one. A superhero, disillusioned and lonely, takes to a life of boozing and petty squabbling with the natives (i.e. us), becoming less and less popular even as he saves lives. Will Smith is always a good choice for summer fare; he has a strong charisma and boyish charm that makes you want to like him. And I'm a fan of Jason Bateman and the ever gorgeous Charlize Theron. But unfortunately, even with all that star power 'Hancock' didn't completely jell for me.I really enjoyed the first half of the movie, but it started to fall apart for me during the second half. Without giving anything away, a bit of a love triangle forms in the middle of the movie. It is eventually resolved - sort of - but for me summer movies usually mean larger than life heroes and clearly delineated good guys and bad guys. Uncomfortable moral quandaries just serve to distract me from the fun. Add to that the lack of any really good villains - most of the bad guys are merely buffoonish - and I was left feeling that I could have enjoyed the movie a lot more with some slight script changes.Finally, after a climactic revelation in the middle of the film, the movie felt a little lacking in direction. No big ""saving the world"" moments, just a kind of ""eh"" feeling. Still, all in all I didn't feel ripped off afterwords, so I sort-of recommend 'Hancock' for a decent if unspectacular Friday or Saturday night movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Unique Take on Superheroes That Falls Short,"""Hancock"" starts with a fresh and intriguing concept, offering a darker, more cynical take on the superhero genre. The film's first half is particularly strong, presenting a reluctant and flawed hero who struggles with both his powers and public perception. Will Smith delivers a solid performance, bringing both charisma and emotional depth to the role, making Hancock a compelling character despite his self-destructive tendencies.Charlize Theron and Jason Bateman provide strong support, with Bateman adding humor and heart as a PR specialist trying to rehabilitate Hancock's image. Theron, on the other hand, brings a mysterious and intriguing presence that adds complexity to the story.However, the film loses its way in the second half, shifting gears in a way that feels rushed and inconsistent. The tonal shift from comedy and satire to a more dramatic and mythology-driven narrative doesn't quite work, making the latter part of the film feel disjointed. The potential for a deeper exploration of Hancock's character and backstory is there, but it feels underdeveloped, leaving the audience with more questions than answers.Despite its flaws, ""Hancock"" remains an entertaining film with a unique premise and strong performances. It just doesn't fully capitalize on its potential, making it a fun but ultimately unremarkable watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""I will break my foot off in your ass, woman.""","It probably had problems, whether literal or subjective (that most people had a problem with), but nothing stood out to me, and I enjoyed this film. It was fun, lighthearted, and easygoing, which is likely why it did so well at the box office. It also had a little bit of heartfeltness with Hancock and Mary. There were quite a few memorable scenes. The premise/backstory was intriguing, although I wish that were more of a focus. Even the CGI was surprisingly decent, although it also looked not-so-decent at the same time; it was a weird but okay middle ground.The most significant praise I can give this film is the comedic moments between Hancock and Mary, including the general chemistry between Will Smith and Charlize Theron. That was further amplified by how impactful (and enjoyable) all their scenes were. I was invested in/cared about their characters and the connection there. Will and Charlize were a fantastic pair that lifted this film to a greater height not reached without them.All three performances of the main cast (Will Smith, Charlize Theron, Jason Bateman) were decent. Will's was probably the best, with Charlize as a close second: and together, they bounced well off each other. Jason was the weakest of the three, but he wasn't bad; I liked his character. He did well with what he got.I liked the score by John Powell, who I'm already familiar with: the Bourne films (excluding The Bourne Legacy), Mr. & Mrs. Smith, and Knight and Day. I think he's my most watched composer; he keeps popping up. That final cue at the end of the film was great. The one before it, as Hancock is on the ground, was good, too, and the one as he's trying to get further away; both may have been the same cue. And I liked Louise Mingenbach's costume design work for Hancock's suit.One thing that could've been better was the tone/story. The first half of the film was about building Hancock back up from a low point, making you think it's going to be about him as a superhero, and it felt competent with a destination in mind. But it shifts to something different, which goes back to what I said in the first paragraph about wishing it was more of a focus; I liked that aspect a lot. And the superhero aspect wasn't that relevant anymore; yeah, there were breadcrumbs sprinkled throughout the rest of the film, but you could tell it was more for show.I feel like one or the other should've been the entire focus instead of doing one for most of the film, then shifting gears completely, even though I liked the underlying details of the film's second half the most. It's hard not to notice the potential of this film. The backstory of Hancock and that side of things could've been more prominent. There could've been more emphasis on the superhero angle of which the first half of the film was building up or more focus on comedic moments or even the action. It's like there was a complete script, but everything after the halfway point got scrapped or rewritten out of nowhere. But what we got was still enjoyable; the first half was the best.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Delivers What You Want In A Superhero Film - Entertainment,"I was nicely surprised to find this a very entertaining movie, start-to-finish, about a reluctant super hero who winds up getting an attitude change for the better. What changes him? A man who cares and his little boy, who also cares and looks up to him. Corny? Maybe....but I liked it.Yeah, it's a nice, sentimental story in those regards which is why the cynical national film critics didn't care for the movie. Nice message: thumbs down; evil - thumbs up. Pretty sad, eh?Being this is a ""superhero"" movie, I didn't expect any credibility: just a fun, escapist story, and that, pretty much, was what was delivered. It had a nice twist near the end, too, which I won't go into for anyone who hasn't seen the film. It's not a total shock, is all I will say, because you can see it coming if you read between the lines.Was this film enjoyable enough to watch a second time, or a third?

Undercooked,"A very good idea sadly undercooked. Rushed and thoughtless but with hints at what it might have been. All of that makes the experience a rather frustrating one. Will Smith is, without question, one of the best actors around and as Hancock, he uses every tiny opportunity to make the whole ludicrous thing almost palatable. When the camera is on him we feel the potential. There is a human being there in an impossible situation. Peter Berg, the director, lets his eye move around as if under the effect of a very powerful drug. Massive, nervous close ups in a story that tries to be missing the point at almost every corner. The actors are photographed harshly showing every skin imperfection even on the wonderful Charlize Theron. I wonder if that was on purpose. In fact that's what I wonder about the whole enterprise. Was it on purpose? Was the thoughtlessness part of the plan? If so, I don't get it.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Original Ideas Stranded by Chaotic Script,"""Hancock"" may be many things, but it's certainly not a traditional superhero movie. That's either a good thing or a bad thing depending on your point of view.I appreciated the many original ideas swirling around the perimeter of this movie, but it's a shame that no one idea ever fully takes hold. The script feels like the product of a brainstorming session before anyone has had a chance to make sense of the notes. And not only is the script somewhat of a mess, but the tone veers all over the place as well. The movie gives the impression of having been directed by several different people.About an hour into ""Hancock,"" the script throws in a surprise twist that director Peter Berg handles deftly, and the movie, that had already been ticking along pretty enjoyably, gets an extra jolt of energy and fun. But that sense of fun drains immediately from the film as the entire tone turns nasty, unpleasant and extremely violent. Bad guys come from nowhere, plot developments don't make a lot of sense and back story is apparently made up as the film moves along. The movie itself is only 90 minutes, so I don't know why the filmmakers felt compelled to rush through to an ending without tying things together in a way that made sense, but on the other hand, I'm glad it wasn't any longer because I was tired of the arbitrariness of the whole thing.It's hard to talk about what could have been without revealing the plot twist, but let's just say that the film could have gone in any number of interesting directions that it chooses to ignore. Due to what it reveals about one of the major characters, the script could have given Hancock either an ally or a compelling villain, but it does neither, and all of the actors -- charismatic as they are -- feel somewhat stranded. Jason Bateman alone keeps things buoyant for as long as he can on the strengths of his goofy charm and comic timing.Grade: B-",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"First part is amazing, second part is not","The first part of the movie was amazing. You get to see the main characters, especially Will Smith's character ''Hancock''. He is a well-defined and well-written character. The first part really got me invested in the movie. And I was really interested in where the movie is going on.And that the same thought of the writers, I guess
Because the second part was really part.But that is maybe because, although the first part was good, sets little to no things up.And that's why the second part is all over the place.There is some action, but is was still boring.The story of the 2nd part is just so weird.Conclusion, I don't really recommend the movie.However, maybe you like the second part and see the second part differently.

Good Job,"It was wholly predictable that this Will Smith film would receive mixed reviews upon its release last year. It's a film that is impossible to pigeonhole – in terms of both genre and mood – which is something critics and many filmgoers don't like. If you're going to make a film about superheroes, their reasoning goes, then you must fill the screen with daring exploits, comic book villains, and world-in-peril scenarios. The superhero must be the good guy throughout, and the PR guy – no matter what the genre – must always, always be bad.Here we have an unshaven, drunken superhero who saves people in peril while possessing no real interest or true desire to help (in fact, given his disinterest and the public's lack of appreciation, it's difficult to understand why he bothers at all). He regularly screws things up, hurling a beached whale out to sea where it crashes onto a boat, and causing millions of dollars worth of damage every time he performs an act of bravery. These early sequences are quite funny – although not in a laugh out loud way – and suggest a pleasing ability on the part of writers Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan to think outside of the box (for want of a better term). The city mayor publicly complains about the expense of his exploits and urges him to go to New York, while bystanders at a level crossing where Hancock has just saved PR man Jason Bateman from certain death criticise the way in which he did it and encourage the guy to sue.The mood is pretty dark for much of the time, and Smith's pretty boy looks are sacrificed (until his character begins to undergo redemption, at least) under the glare of harsh lighting. We probably see a truer image of what Smith really looks like here: the rougher skin, the lines, the heavier features of a forty-year-old man that are magically stripped away by ingenious lighting (just compare him in the prison scenes and the restaurant scene), and it suggests that he could make a highly believable bad guy if he chose to.As Hancock undergoes his transformation thanks to the help of the PR man he saved, a totally unexpected twist is thrown into the mix which gives the film its third act just as it's beginning to look like its going nowhere. Of course this is where the plot holes begin to appear, but every film has holes and this one has fewer than many other films which enjoy a better reputation. In the end the film is all about the superhero saving himself – as it is throughout, when you think about it – and this is possibly why it isn't as appreciated as it should be. The film's left open for a sequel, which is already rumoured to have the green light. It's a shame; I think this is one of those films that deserves to stand alone.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hancock is Good,"Armed only with the knowledge afforded me by the previews, I went to see Hancock not quite knowing what to expect.I thought it was very entertaining and had a solid, original story.It looked great, and Will Smith did his thing.I didn't care for the constant 'shaky cam' approach in the film and some parts of the story either didn't make sense to me or could have used a few finishing touches.If you're looking for a fresh superhero film (that won't be joining the Avengers), Hancock is the film for you.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great Original Superhero Flick (Hidden Gem),"I'm amazed this scored so low! Whether you like Will Smith or not, this has everything you could ask for.Some notes for consideration: This was a movie that faced some serious adversity from the beginning.The script for this was written in 1996 which makes the film all the more intriguing knowing just how many directors were cycled through before it finally went into production (11 years later!). The title alone started out as ""Tonight, He Comes"" followed by ""John Hancock"" and then simply ""Hancock"". Even the desired rating of PG-13 was a struggle to acquire, as the MPAA had twice already dubbed it ""R"".But after all was said and done, Hancock took the #1 spot after opening weekend with mixed reviews (41% Rotten Tomatoes, 49% Metacritic)! With a production budget of $150 million it brought in $185.6 million after the opening weekend (worldwide, 5 day weekend).Now on to the actual content:The script is refreshing. Not only are there twists throughout, but they are highly unpredictable and start to expose themselves within the first 30 minutes.The cast consists of Will Smith, Charlize Theron and Jason Bateman whom all demonstrate outstanding performances (as one would expect from them). The humor is believable and not overdone, the drama is the perfect amount leaving you laughing and feeling sorrow throughout.As mentioned before, even if you are not a huge Will Smith fan this will surely be something anyone can enjoy. I am quite puzzled by the general consensus here on IMDb but assure you that the film is much better than the rating would infer.----- 8/10 STARS -------- Review by Searsino -----",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Surprisingly Good,"The latest Will Smith effort is much different from the average big budget flashy superhero movies that have dominated the box office the last few years. Don't go to Hancock thinking you are seeing another Superman, Fantastic 4, Ironman or Hulk. The superhero angle is treated much differently here. I think part of the perception problem with this film is from the silly trailers we have seen for the last 6 months. Those trailers represent a small part a movie that is so much more to than a drunken superhero throwing a whale at a boat, swearing at a kid or wrecking the city. Sure, there are laughs in this movie, but it's Will Smith! He's FUNNY! Go see Hancock because it's DIFFERENT from the mega-budget movies that come straight from the comic book pages complete with a witty Stan Lee cameo. Don't get me wrong, I loved Ironman and The Hulk. But Hancock is not a movie that will have comic book geeks arguing on message boards about how the movie left so much out and the character was nothing like the comic. It is a film with a story that happens to be about a guy with super powers. Besides, it's got Will Smith and Charlize Theron in it! How can you go wrong?",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Charlize Theron is OK but nothing special. The special effects are great for the most part, but there are several scenes that cause plot holes. The final act of the movie is when it disappoints.6/10Make sure you stick around for the credits there's a hilarious scene just about a minute in.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
gack,"This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The plot is threadbare and totally predictable, and it's really only a minimalist vehicle for the special effects, which are also predictable (and violent and repetitive).Will Smith is smug and 2-dimensional at best. Jason Bateman's character is pretty much the guy he played in Arrested Development. Charlize Theron is also 2D.The closeups were all done with a jiggly hand-held camera look, which was mostly just really irritating. I resorted to just keeping my eyes closed after awhile.I was really tempted to ask for a refund of the ticket price. It was that bad.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A superhero movie for people who hate superhero movies,"Browsing the most popular reviews for this flick, I see most of them criticize ""Hancock"" for not having enough action, not enough cgi, not having a super villain, or my favorite: getting too philosophical. See, this is why Hollywood keeps cranking out brainless superhero flicks; they know that the target audience doesn't want to be challenged with something completely different.I suppose ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" would've gotten the same treatment by imdb reviewers if imdb existed back in 1968 when the core scifi market demanded laser beams, monster suits, buxom babes in distress and loud things in space.""Hancock"" does to the superhero genre what ""2001"" did to scifi. It made things real. Sure, Hancock zips through the sky like Superman on crack, but the point is that Hancock (played by Will Smith) is an ordinary schmuck like you or me, except that he happens to have super powers. Even worse, he has the world's worst case of idgaf, and this leads to a lot of stuff getting broken, bent and blown up unnecessarily. As a result, people hate him.Right there is the all the plot you need. You don't need a contrived super villain just because that's the formula. You don't need nonstop action and dazzling cgi to tell this story. This is because Hancock's enemy is himself.""Hancock"" could easily have been a heavy, brooding drama like ""Leaving Las Vegas"" or anything dealing with self-hatred, addiction or depression. BUT, this is the movie's charm, instead it's done very light-heartedly, with lots of zingers, funny sight gags and a quirky dysfunctional romance angle. And of course superhero powers. And so, this heavy story ends up being fun and entertaining, even breezy. But the more you think about it, there's a lot under the surface.So, as my title says, if you're not a fan of most superhero flicks, the kind with a clean good vs. evil template peppered with zippy action scenes and cgi, then give ""Hancock"" a look. There aren't a lot of movies like this, definitely not many mainstream ones, but I'd put it in the same category as ""Special"" with Michael Rappaport playing a total loser who develops bizarre super powers. On the more disturbing side there's ""Super"" with Rainn Wilson who takes his vigilante superhero efforts a bit too far. These are all deep films under the candy exterior of ""superhero flick"".",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Misunderstood or just Misguided?,"Negative buzz has been surrounding Hancock for quite some time, yet not in my life it hasn't. Ever since I saw the first trailer for the movie I got excited about it, it looked genuinely funny, inventive and it starred Will Smith, a sure fire success then right? Will Smith is a great actor and I love nearly every movie he has ever been in, even I Am Legend had its great moments. Yet there is one Will Smith I cannot stand, that being Wild Wild West, which for the sake of space and time I won't even begin criticising. So does Hancock live up to his greats, or deserves to be dead and buried like Wild Wild West? Well it's a mixture of both to be honest. Obviously I didn't hate it, hence the 6/10 rating, but it was also dull and boring in some sections, only livened by Smith's electric presence. Let me start by saying the start of the movie is priceless, funny and witty as hell. Smith gives his funniest performance in years and the movie is brilliant. Unfortunately once we hit the jail scenes onwards the movie hits a snag, while it does have its dark humour streak but Will Smith's sharp tongue alone cannot gloss over the fact the movie is going absolutely nowhere at an incredibly slow pace. As the movie goes on it just descends into almost madness with loads of waffle about immortals and a twist so obvious that I rolled my eyes when it happened. Still the movie does have its share of action and the comedy is pretty inventive, yet its not the movie it really could have been and is certainly nowhere near Smith's best.So onto the acting. As I've previously said Will Smith is truly brilliant in the role, when we first meet him he's a drunken slob who is hated by everyone. He makes out he doesn't care that he's hated but deep down he really does, still these scenes give Smith the opportunity to come out with some classic lines. The best by far being his response to a fat person, I won't spoil it but it made me cry with laughter. Even as the plot gets more and more silly Smith still does a good performance. Admittedly he does become too nice a superhero towards the end, and you do wish his darker streak would return. Charlize Theron does a good job in a role that starts off unimportant but gradually shows importance later. By the end she delivers a pretty impressive performance, and she also seems to be having some fun. Still her opening scenes are pretty painful and bland to watch. Jason Bateman is pretty good for the first half of the movie, being funny and interesting at the same time. Unfortunately he pretty much becomes pointless near the end, in fact its his absence towards the end that really impacts on the movie. The focus on Hancock's relationship with him at the beginning if the best parts of the movie, take that away and it loses its sheen a bit. And then we go onto the lead villain duties, played by Eddie Marsan. To say the character is garbage is an understatement, I doubt I'd class him as a villain, he's more of an after thought that anything else. Its an average performance for a poor character.So do the successes of Hancock outweigh its mediocrity? Thankfully it just about does. The first third of the movie is a solid 9/10 movie, no question about it. The second third is a 3/10 movie, and the final third just about gets a 6/10, so on average the movie is a 6/10 movie. The script itself is pretty sharp for the most part, only losing its focus near the muddled conclusion. The directing is solid for the most part, although the constant usage of hand-held cameras does start to get annoying in your average talky bit, I just wanted to scream at the director to keep still! The action and special effects are extremely good, the final third takes pride in its big brawls and they do really thrill. The opening bits with Hancock flying are equally impressive. However its the odd indecision of whether the movie is serious or a comedy that really proves the movies down point. Its three movies in one, only one being the movie it really should have been. Still it is a bit of moderate summer fare, and I suspect kids and easily pleased adults will find much to enjoy with Hancock. Its also highly forgettable as well, a shame as with a sharper focus this could have been one of the best movies of the year.Overall Hancock is the big average movie of the summer, while funny and witty, the movie is also dull and sluggish. Will Smith just about rises this above mediocrity, but I'm afraid it's destined to be forgotten pretty quickly.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Less than super,"""Hancock"" is the summer's dark horse. Early trailers made it seem like a superhero spoof, then it looked like a dark comedy, then an action extravaganza. It's hard to tell what this movie is and the news of all the directors and studios who left the project, the fact that the subject matter has been called controversial and an extreme contrast to your usual summer movie experience, and that the MPAA has ""R-ed"" this movie twice before the studio finally went back and made major edits to get the PG-13 all come into question as this movie gets the coveted huge July 4 weekend audience all to itself. It's a major gamble, but having Will Smith in your movie is a good card to play.Smith stars as John Hancock, a boozing, vulgar, misunderstood superhero living a life of solitude in Los Angeles. He tries to do the right thing but usually every heroic save also creates some horrible damage that leaves him continually shunned by the public. Not that he cares. A life of being the only one of his kind has given him a tough demeanor and a thick skin, but then he saves the life of a PR man named Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman). Ray is eternally grateful and offers to take up Hancock as his client to the chagrin of Ray's wife (Charlize Theron), who believes Hancock can't be fixed.Every once in a while a movie comes along that I can only describe asnice. I wish it were better but I admired it for trying to do something new and felt there were some good scattered moments in a sadly unpleasing whole. The movie is at its most entertaining when Hancock is being an asshole, flying through the air with a whiskey bottle in hand, toying with a car full of criminals, or throwing a washed up whale back in the ocean or a little kid far into the air. It's funny stuff, as is a prison fight that ends with a guy's head up another guys ass.But the movie is really just a half-formed idea. Hancock's origin story is meager and forgettable and his vulnerabilities are lacking. There's no tension in anything that's happening because everything just seems like a cake walk to Hancock. He easily thwarts bank robberies and saves people in distress but that's really it. You want to see him go up against incredible odds or a super villain but the closest thing to is some one-dimensional thug bent on revenge. The screenplay, by Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan, seems so desperate to create real drama that it introduces a superhero wife for Hancock and then manufactures some lame excuse for why she is the worse thing for him. It all leads to an ending that turns depressingly talky, uninteresting, and just leaves a lot of loose ends.The special effects are serviceable. Hancock flies. Hancock throws people and things up in the air. He lands with a ground-breaking thud. Just where is the wow factor? This movie cost over $100 million dollars to make but there is nothing cool that stands out or shows any kind of ingenuity on the part of the filmmakers. I said it earlier but Will Smith is the best thing this movie has. He's a charismatic guy who knows how to make a surly, unlikable character seem like he has a soul under all the glum boozing. His performance reminded me of Robert Downey Jr.'s performance in ""Iron Man,"" though the material was 100 times better with Downey. Bateman isn't given much to do here and even though it's good to see Theron playing sexy again for a change, she spends most of the movie giving off an iciness which is pretty off-putting.There is going to be speculation that all the edits to bring the movie down to a PG-13 is the reason behind ""Hancock's"" flaws. It could very well be the reason why this movie feels more like an idea than an actual fleshed-out screenplay. It's tame when it should be super. And yet the movie sort of works when it's having fun with the character. So I was torn between recommending or not and all I can really say is.. it's nice.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Story=Simple; Exciting=No; Smith=Still Good;Enternatining=Kind of, yes;","I like to go through a simple checklist of a few simple questions when reviewing movies. The first question being: did it waste my time? For Hancock, the answer is no it did not.The story of Hancock is very simple overall, though the concept is interesting and there is a small twist which keeps the 2nd half of the movie from dragging and makes the overall movie more interesting. But I must emphasize that the story is extremely simple. The trailer gives it all except for the twist, which I won't post about as that would be a spoiler. Super-powered individual, is a drunk and not very good at it. Along comes PR man who helps him. The twist doesn't make the story any more complicated but it helps fill the hour and a half.The second question is: did it waste my money? For me, the answer is no. For you, depends...A lot of you pay an arm and a leg to see a movie. I don't understand why you put up with it, but that's another topic. I do not pay much for movies and I get digital projection, digital knock-your-socks-off surround sound and reserved seating in seats with leg room, ample padding and that recline. In that context this movie did not waste my money.This movie is entertaining in that sit back, turn your mind off and watch a movie way. It had laughs, limited but nice effects, eye candy and a simple but engaging enough story that I didn't check my watch once. There was no excitement, though, and nothing to set your pulse racing. Some people commented that this movie was lacking a villain. That is a valid point but I am not sure if a villain wouldn't have made it much worse. The charm of this movie was in its well done simplicity and a super bad guy might have tipped it into the bad, run-of-the-mill superhero movie category.A big part of what makes this movie entertaining is Will Smith. I almost hate to say it, as that guy has grown so arrogant that its a big turn off. However, he does have a way with the comedy and a charm that pulls you into a character. Both of which were key to making this movie entertaining, and he delivered.The last question is: should you see it?I would say it depends on if you are in the mood to be lightly entertained and you like Will Smith. If you're looking for a great movie experience, this is not it. If you're looking for a roller coaster ride, this is not it. If you hate Will Smith, you're going to hate this movie. If you've got time/money to kill or going to see this movie drunk or in an altered state, yeah go see it. Otherwise, you will probably enjoy it more at home for the price of a rental or the bandwidth time of your broadband.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Will Smith Delivers another Summertime Movie Treat,"I caught a preview showing of Hancock tonight. I enjoyed it for what it was which is a fun, mostly fast-paced popcorn flick. The writers of the film also tossed in a nice plot twist that I didn't see coming but it turned out to work just fine. This isn't Shakespeare so I don't demand a lot of deep thought just some escapist fun. Will Smith does an excellent job of playing the disinterested superhero with an existential crisis. It was good to see Jason Bateman again but a bummer as well seeing how he has aged. This means I am not so young myself anymore. Jae Head didn't overact nor did the script writers push the ""cute"" button to the point of being saccharine. It will be interesting to see how this movie performs to see if Smith wants to do a sequel. So I am more than happy to recommend Hancock to fans of the ""Summer Blockbuster"" and those who enjoy Will Smith.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Tonight, He ComesHancock","Hancock has the kind of premise that you wonder why it took so long for someone to put it on the big screen. With the plethora of comic book movies coming to cinemas this decade, it was only a matter of time before we were given a tale of a washed up superhero, drunk and lonely, being berated for his destruction rather than praised for his bravery. Alan Moore delved into this realm with his graphic novel Watchmen, (for which it seems Zach Snyder has not massacred turning it into a film itself), and Pixar's The Incredibles touched a bit on the subject with the disbanding of heroes by the government, however, here is something different. This guy doesn't hide his identity or pretend he is something he's not. No, he lets it all out on the line and most of it is unflattering and just plain rude. Jaded from the lack of respect he receives, John Hancock finds that he'd rather wallow away in solitude than try and make people like him. Sure he will still go out and help where he can, while making 9 billion dollars worth of damage, but when he's done, it's back to the bar and the bottle, his only friends in the world.All that changes with a chance meeting of a down-on-his-luck public relations man. Caught a second from death as a train barrels down on his car, Hancock swoops in and saves his life, while harming many others in the process. Seeing an opportunity to get back into the big leagues, Ray Embrey decides to make his hero his new client. By having this freak of nature turn himself into authorities for the warrant out for his arrest due to the multiple fines and disturbing the peace charges, Ray thinks that a little time away from the city will show the people how much they need him. While incarcerated, crime goes up 30% in just five days, people start to worry as the criminals begin to feel invincible, and, to top it all off, Hancock gets a little quiet time to himself so that he can rework his image. Dealing with anger issues and alcoholism on the inside, Ray also begins to work on his personality, turning him into a civil person, or at least as close as he can get, (when you see Hancock's smile for the camera, you'll understand what I mean). Once the city comes a calling, his rebirth will allow him to be ready to take control as someone the public can trust, rather than hate.Ripe for comedy, the fact that Ray is played by the immensely talented Jason Bateman and Hancock by Will Smith, the film delivers on the funny. I always assume when Bateman gets on a roll that a lot is improvised, and once again I wouldn't be surprised if that's the case here. The two build a fantastic rapport and the sarcastic wit flies back and forth. What is refreshing amidst this comic bent we expect is how good Smith is as the jerk. This guy has made a name for himself as the blockbuster hero, modest and heroic to a fault, never showing a selfish bone in his body. Here, however, he is egotistical, self-absorbed, and downright mean. It's like how I felt watching Russell Crowe chew the scenery in 3:10 to Yuma, watching a great actor play against type is like discovering them all over again. Smith is one of the best out there and he doesn't disappoint.As a whole, it really is just about these two guys, becoming business partners and friends as they ride the waves to success. I don't want to leave the rest of the cast behind, though, and must make mention of Charlize Theron. After reading an early synopsis, when the film was still titled Tonight, He Comes, I had her character pegged into a certain place. I was completely wrong and surprised to see where her role goes as she plays a very crucial part to the story. I will admit to never really getting all the hype around her, (no I have not seen Monster yet, it'll happen eventually), but she is very solid here as usual, I don't dislike her, I just don't see the unending praise. Also, like every Peter Berg film of late, this thing is chock full of cameos, (you'll even see the director himself, hearkening back to his ""Chicago Hope"" days in a split second scene). I mean, when you get director pal Michael Mann and writer Akiva Goldsman to poke fun at themselves in a board meeting, you know this guy enjoys what he does and invites his friends along for the ride.Despite all that works for it, the film doesn't quite do its premise service. If the writers would have stuck to the comedy element and continued on that path, I think the story would have benefited. Instead, Hancock attempts to be bigger then it is. Without any real villain to root against, (the only bad guy is actually Hancock himself as he tries to turn his life around), there isn't really anything to create a worthwhile climax with weight. Instead we are shown a chance coincidence and how the stakes of that event hold the lives of two of our leads in the balance. The situation wants to be dramatichence the slow-mo visualsbut ultimately becomes a bit out of place if not obvious. It all works OK, though, mostly because the film itself is very slight and devoid of true plot. The evolution of Hancock is a rapid one and at barely an hour and a half, there's not much room for more depth. The laughs are big, however, and the film entertaining, so as a popcorn summer tent-pole, Smith will most definitely deliver some big numbers, even though he's going against that cute little Pixar robot.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A good premise ruined by bad direction.,"How do weak directors land $100+ budgets? The audiences are too stupid to know what weak film-making is. Berg's shaky, hand-held (and shifting focus) style is emblematic of a director walking on to the set with no idea what he's going to shoot. Just keep the cameras moving and try to pass it off as a ""style"". This technique is (over)used in the last few years, especially in action scenes to the point where now, it doesn't seem to matter if you can tell what's happening in a scene as long as you know a lot of 'stuff' is going on. To use this same technique in a boardroom where people are sitting around talking, just pulls you out of the films and asking yourself ""what the hell is THAT about?"" The same lazy, sloppy style was used in ""Constand Gardner"", another film that suffered from for the ignornance of not realizing that this technique can sometimes work in scenes of intense energy, angst or action...but doesn't play in others. If you're thinking about the direction, the director has failed...and Berg failed through most of the movie on this one.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This deserves some credit,"Perhaps I'm being generous, but I think this movie deserves some credit. It's a serious take on a dysfunctional superhero that isn't based upon a Marvel Comics or DC Comics character. The special effects aren't as good as a movie like Transformers, but at least you aren't getting an animated CGI character hopping around like you do in Hulk and Spiderman. It appears that several elements of this movie may be inspired by the now defunct Broadway Comics. The classic scene of a car being skewered on a spire was depicted in the ""Powers That Be"" comic and the dysfunctional marriage relationship in the movie is not unlike the ""Shadow State"" comic by Broadway. Perhaps seeing similar depictions hit the big screen made me appreciate the movie more.Will Smith and Charlize Theron do a great job. The hero is flawed, but he's not a wimp. The movie's biggest weakness is the pacing. Some of the special effects go by so fast that you don't get to appreciate them. Some of the drama plays out so slowly that you might be wondering why they don't rush it along. The movie is faithful to the trailer. It's tough writing a spoiler-free review of this since there are some great twists in the plot.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Doesn't live up to its hype.,"Hancock is a story of a superhero named John Hancock who has a hard time coping with his life and misuses his calling, while he happens to be a superhero who flies and has super-strength, we see him annihilating half LA whenever he does something heroic. Although the idea seemed interesting, we see the writers trapped in their own simplistic story with no where to go. The first half of the film is no where near perfect but is fairly interesting with amazing special effects and funny one-liners. But as the so called plot twist happens, the story diverts into this crazy pile of confusion. In addition to that I had to suffer Peter Berg's wacky way of directing. I am talking about the close-up shots. One or two is okay. But when it is in every other scene and it is so that I can count how many zits are on the characters faces, that becomes unbearable and annoying. I would be telling a lie if I said that Hancock is a wonderful film, it is fairly interesting, though I was expecting better from Will Smith.6.4/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
strange but funny and cool,"My first thought to the idea of this movie was"" don't wanna see it"". Again a superhero movie... but can say that when leaving the theater thought it was enjoyable. The best of the story is about relationships and Smith's relationship with himself; so I could conclude that the film is more character-driven than effects-driven (and effects are really impressive...). Plus there is a good dose of humor that certainly helps. On the whole ""Hancock"" is not a kid's movie but kids too will love it for sure due to the lead being aloof, cool, indestructible, angry and alone at the same time. Charlize Theron gorgeous as usual but that's not surprising at all..",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Signing off on ""Hancock""","Some movies are simply poor ideas put into practice and thus become movies we come to regard as ""bad"". Others are good ideas that are presented to the viewer and are often well-received. Then there's Peter Berg's ""Hancock"", the story of a boozing, loutish, seemingly un-superhero that falls somewhere in between the aforementioned categories.Will Smith plays John Hancock, a superhuman with enhanced abilities in strength, invulnerability, and flight, who, though he tries to save Los Angeles from all sorts of crime, usually ends up costing the city millions of dollars in damages and endangering many people through his alcohol-induced carelessness. When the city's officials decide they have had enough, they issue a warrant for Hancock's arrest. At the behest of Ray (Jason Bateman), a publicist who has been saved by the ""hero"", Hancock enters a county jail to serve his time and prove that the city actually needs him. With Ray regularly consulting him on his public appearance and the city's crime rate rising at an astonishing 30 percent over a two week time span, Hancock emerges from jail by request of the captain of the LAPD to once again the city safe.With these pieces set into place with plenty of humor sprinkled throughout the movie, I was convinced that critics were simply being stuck up in their reviews - true to form, many critics poorly rate movies they deem to be below them. However, the plot actually takes a turn for the worse in trying to trace the path of Hancock's origin and also build his romance with Ray's wife Mary, played by Charlize Theron. While the first half of the film had been very much enjoyable, the last half hour or so drags, with the comedy running sparse and the storyline running thin. In the end, ""Hancock"" is less likable due to it's poor execution in the second half, and I found myself in the same situation as many critics - disappointed.And thus, I return to my initial point; ""Hancock"" is not bad idea for a film - in fact, it has the potential to work as a great action comedy - but it falls short of the expectations many would hold for it by falling somewhere in between ""good"" and ""bad"".",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A very unique and awesome superhero film!,"Great story and directing, and the casting and performances of Will Smith, Charlize Theron and Jason Bateman was spot on! If you're a fan of this genre, this is a must see film.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hancock An Enjoyable Film With Flaws,"Hacock is an enjoyable film with flaws but it's still worth seeing because of the talented cast including Will Smith, Charlize Theron, and Jason Bateman. Actor/Director Peter Berg does a good job of bringing this movie to the big screen with cool special effects, some intense action, and humor but the film overall could've been better. The special effects and the action sequences are well executed but unfortunately none of them stand out. I really wanted to like this movie which I did but there were something things that weren't the greatest. Some of the surprises I saw coming and the film lacked a villain who posed as a real threat to Will Smith's Hancock. There's one the movie but his character isn't that interesting just your average criminal who lacks screen time, development, and dialogue. Smith does a solid job in the title role playing a man with powers who doesn't want to be a superhero and is looking for answers to his mysterious past. Charlize Theron is good as always as Mary Embrey who looks at Hanock as if they've met before and has a big secret of her own. Jason Bateman is funny as Mary's husband Ray who is saved by Hancock and tries to help him change his image so that people will respect him. The rest of the cast are okay in their roles but none of them have much to do. As mentioned before the special effects are cool but some of them aren't the greatest either because you know most of what you're seeing was done in a computer. Overall though Hanock is worth seeing because of the impressive performances by the cast who make it with your time. If you're a fan of Will Smith or you're just looking for a movie with some action and humor you can't go wrong with Hancock. If you can't get past it's flaws Hanock makes for a somewhat entertaining movie to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Changes...a bit....,"Last summer a superhero film stormed the box offices both sides of the Atlantic. It was called Hancock, a film about an alcoholic superhero played by Will Smith. A bundle of laughs? NOThe film follows the path of a rude, disgusting, irritating superhero called John Hancock (Will Smith). The public hate him; he causes millions of ""dollars"" worth of damage, is a drunk and makes constantly obscene comments about people. But one day he happens to save the life of a PR Guru (Jason Bateman) and is offered a chance to save his image. This starts of his avid career as a superhero. Until a chance encounter causes the film to dive bomb into the realms of beyond crap.It slots perfectly into the genre of comedy, action, superhero, adventure, romance, sci-fi, fantasy and crime. Though this great mixture of genres usually benefits films, with Hancock it just doesn't work. The film jumps between the various genres so quickly that you never have the actual time to register what's happening and whether the scene is meant to be sarcastic or sentimental. The style changes drastically too; between sad violin music and the latest chart hip-hop; between big set action pieces and amusing family dinners. This attempt at appealing to everybody fails miserably.Personally I would recommend this film to people who have nothing better to do with their time then watch Will Smith throw cars around and make obscenely offensive comments about people. This is not a family film due to the crude remarks, excessive language and unnecessary violence; basically if you showed it to your grandma she would have a heart attack and spend the rest of her life in hospital only able to move the big toe of her left foot.The acting in it is frankly amateur (or should I say appalling). None of the actors seam to like what they are doing- they don't even seam to be trying- they're just acting normally. The producers have obviously tried very hard to get people to hate Will Smith and it works- he is possibly the most unlikeable character in the whole film. British actor Eddie Marsan plays the ""bad guy"" Red, he is acceptable apart the slightly dodgy attempt at an American accent. Not Good. If I was being nice I would say that Will Smith shows quite a good performance as the disgusting superhero, then I look through his previous films and realise that all his characters are basically the same. Only for really die-hard fans.The special effects are disappointing especially when he attempts to land on a pavement in front of some guys house. You feel as if you are watching a 1963 Batman film before they had discovered the wonders of CGI. In fact the CGI is so disappointing it's actually hilarious especially at the end, when you just really want somebody to die, but they just carry on throwing tea urns and hospital beds around while a giant CGI'd thunderstorm rages outside the window- not a good look.In comparison to other films in the genre of Superhero/Comedy it looks terrible. Take Hellboy for instance; the tongue in cheek humour of Guillermo Del Toro combined with the great fantasy creatures in the style of Pans Labyrinth and sarcastic superhero, the film does a really great job. However next to Hellboy the film Hancock just looks more annoyingly, terribly, irritatingly amateur. If you're looking for a decent superhero film with laughs see Hellboy, if you're looking for a dark, chilling superhero film see The Dark Knight and if you're looking for a boring, arrogant, overdone superhero film see Hancock.Overall this film is possibly the worst superhero film of the summer. Only see it if you have to.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I liked this superhero movie.,"I didn't see this one for awhile as the reviews seemed to hint that it was intended as a comedy and that it somehow fell short.When I saw it I realized that it was a good fresh-from-scratch (as far as I know) superhero story. Sure, there was humor to the plot that was introduced (a down-and-out type with Superman-ish powers and an image problem because he keeps screwing up) but I thought the character development was decent for a quick new superhero story, and I also liked the love story element. The hero's weakness was I thought a ""good"" one (it made me think a bit), and the love story aspect to the movie was something that worked OK I thought.There were values championed here that I didn't entirely agree with. The whole generic off-the-shelf anti-profit save-the-world-through-charity theme didn't seem to find enough contrast, I thought, though there was maybe a ""tiny"" bit. Still, some of us are accustomed at this point to having to overlook that sort of theme in order to find the elements of a story to like and I'm not sure Hollywood writers allow themselves to do many superhero stories that don't have this sort of theme hardwired into the plot whether we like it or not.What they didn't seem to have here was years and decades of comic books upon which to rely for their plot and villain and story-line development and so the movie may seem a bit more sparse than one of the big DC or Marvel Comics or other comic-book-based superhero movies, but I was very good with it, and while it may help really fill up the screen for 2 hours if you are doing a movie about 10-70 years' worth of comics, I suppose it might also weigh it down.I liked Charlize Theron. I'm not sure if it was her role, her look, her acting or the chemistry with the other actors or all four.I give it 8 stars, and would look forward to another installment if Smith and Theron really honestly wanted to do it (i.e.: if it came across as not being just about the money of a part II). I mention further development in part because I thought the basic aspects and powers and weaknesses of the superhero they created were ""not bad at all"" and so there could be other story possibilities.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great potential wasted.....,"OK I'm just back from seeing the latest Will Smith summer event movie ""Hancock"". Expectation was quite high having seen the trailers.The premise behind the film certainly had enough promise and potential. It had a ""something new"" and fresh appeal to it. We also had arguable the biggest box office star going attached to the films title character, so it surely going to be an awesome spectacle and the hit of the summer.Well I can't quite comment wither or not the film will be the box office smash of the year, but I certainly can state in my opinion that it AIN'T the ""awesome spectacle"" I initially thought it could be. So what went wrong?The film has no soul, from the very start to the ending credits the film feels empty. No emotion attached to the project, no feeling of awe. Can't quite put my finger on the spot but something major was lacking in the movie experience for the viewer regarding the overall feel of the flick.No character arc's worth mentioning, I know we are supposed to not be that keen on the Hancock character, but there must be something in the character that we will grow to love. There ain't, Hancock has an effect flat-line arc. This is exactly the same with the other major players in the movie. Nobody gets developed fully or even slightly throughout the rather short 90 minutes or so running time.The score was also terrible, from start to end.The Superhero back story again was extremely weak.Villains were so weak, we didn't really need anybody with super-powers to deal with them.The first half or so of the movie was at least enjoyable popcorn fun, but the latter half was particularly weak. When the film became ""serious"" when the drama kicked off the film just became severely lost. It lost structure, it didn't know what genre it wanted to be, action, drama, continued comedy or suspense. Unfortunately for the viewer it was none of them so just became pointless and irritating. They really should have padded out the idea of the first 45 minutes with some more evolved ideas from the part of the story and we might well have had a good movie. Unfortunately they didn't and they padded the film out with a tangent story-line that made no coherence or sense.There are positives, Will Smith for what he had to play with was as usual entertaining to watch. The Jason Bateman character was likable and also enjoyable to watch, well up until the third act when he frittered away to a cardboard cutout. Special effects were more than adequate, and at times quite spectacular. There was also a few laugh out loud moments, particularly the Youtube scenes.Overall this film had so much potential, this movie could have and should have been great, but unfortunately it was very poorly handled and executed. The blame must fall down to the direction, and script.Half marks, 5/10 Worth going to see.......just.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Confused Tone Makes For An Uneven Film,"When I heard this movie was getting produced I jumped to the conclusion this was a bio-pic on the British comedian Tony Hancock "" Will Smith is Hancock "" Hmmm . There might have been a serious fly in that ointment but rest assured if Smith pulled it off then we'd have the greatest acting performance in the history of cinema . As it turned out this wasn't in fact what HANCOCK was about and concerned itself with a burned out super-hero . One wonders if studios should put a bit more thinking in to film titles ? After all can anyone remember that sci-fi epic called JOHN CARTER ? Not really a title you equate with sci-fiAs it turns out I thought HANCOCK might be the sort of super-hero to appeal to someone like me and that is someone who doesn't the avalanche of films featuring Marvel comic book characters and the like . A burned out hero with super powers and a drink problem finds himself unable to care about the world about him . Not a premise you see every day and one that is original . It also deserves some credit for a lack of post-modernism and any temptation to include references to the likes of Bruce Wayne , Peter Parker and Clark Kent has been curtailed . If you're going in to this film thinking it's an extension or at least inspired by the comic book blockbusters that were coming out at the same time then that's what you're going to get . After seeing the movie I'm not entirely sure what I gotThere's a very strange and often uneven tone to the movie . Peter Berg has a bizarre directorial technique where the camera zooms in and out of the action in a hap hazard way . Some scenes are played totally straight and serious and then there's a big set piece done in a manner done in a manners that apes the films it's giving the impression it's not trying to be . It also seems to contain a bit too many ideas for its own good which has led to a lot of comments here that HANCOCK is a bit of a mess . I don't totally disagree with this view but as someone who feels the need to once again state that there's far too many movies about super-heroes I did enjoy this movie to a limited extent though I find it very difficult to explain why",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Enjoy the movie,"After reading the reviews and critiques the one thing that was apparent is people can become close minded to stories regarding certain story lines. A super hero story is not always regarding Hero vs villain only.If you would like to see a movie with some extremely hilarious moments, pieced with action and an under lying story you may or may not expect this is worth a try.Will smith and Charlize Theron deliver top notch acting as usual and Jason Bateman rounds the cast well.Go in with no preconceived notions and you will be entertained pleasantly.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not A Typical Homeless,"With mild drama and twist turning action I suspected this movie to be something special. Having everyone hate you is just the forte of being Hancock (Will Smith). While most of society may not like him, he coasts through an existence as an unemployed, homeless man with superhuman capabilities. Unlike conventional movies, Hancock is a hero with an attitude. He may not act with justice at times, but it does not take away the heart that rests inside. Why then would I give this a five then? Well mainly, because of the twist. At first the story line appeared to be heading in a nice and pleasant direction, but the fatal twist halfway made me think differently. I suspect that the writers wrote it to provide complexity, but I just felt it was unnecessary. Overall though, it had a unique storyline and was truly one of a kind. Even though I did not find the twist satisfying, I believe that it is still worth the watch for most of it. With or without doubts I say go out and watch it and be the judge of what you see.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Almost bad.,"The beginning was quite OK, then it seemed as if the crew did not have enough imagination to create a fully developed image of the characters, time and place of the action. However, since this hero is unknown to the audience (no comic books, no prequel etc.), it is very hard for such movies to get immediately on the top and to gain the admiration. Yeah... I felt so odd... I did not know who Hancock was, and I had an odd impression maybe because I got used to the way how other such type of movies were created (Iron Man, Superman...). I do think that the crew HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB, but I feel it could have been better if instead of Charlize Theron there would be another actress. IMHO, she has a talent, but in this role she has been too... impersonal...",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Highly entertaining despite the tonal shift,"Hancock certainly has one of the most drastic tonal shifts of recent memory. What starts off as a really fun superhero comedy turns into an unexpectedly self serious melodrama. Both halves are entertaining even though they don't mesh and that first half in particular has only gotten better since comic book movies really had their moment.It's interesting to see something that is first and foremost a comedy, take the conventions of the genre more seriously than the more straight faced films that succeeded it. Few comic book movies openly acknowledge the responsibility that comes with godlike power like this does and it still finds the time to shove a man's head up another's ass.Will Smith's general disinterest works so well for Hancock's carefree attitude. His boundless charisma shines through with every insult and it's kinda refreshing to see all that energy dialled back whilst losing none of his personality. If anyone comes close to making that massive tonal shift work, it's definitely Charlize Theron who wholeheartedly commits to both sides of it.Peter Berg's direction moves too fast which works in its favour when it comes to preventing the more serious second half from draining all the fun out of it and the action uses the superpowers for pretty inventive ideas. John Powell's score makes it obvious what films were used as reference points by sounding very similar to their scores without actually stealing from them.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Bad job asshole!,"OK, I must admit I'm not a fan of the Super Hero movie type. Generally I don't use to watch it and I don't use to appreciate it, but even so I can distinct when it is a good Super Hero movie, or a bad one, full of clichés and ""Hollywood garbage""! That said, I just can tell you my opinion about this movie: it sucks! But it sucks so badly! Aside from some nice jokes and some cool special effects, this movie has nothing interesting to offer! The plot is pathetic and gets even worse when it starts being melodramatic. The characters are laughable and absurd, even for a Super Hero movie, and if it's true that a Super Hero film can be entertaining, at least for the action or the jokes, this one completely spoils these two positive features with a completely absurd and melodramatic plot! And that ending, Oh my God, that was definitely too bad! To sum up: Bad job asshole (I can call you that how many times I want!)",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Here comes the Hancock!,"He is alcoholic, least bothered about your concerns and doesn't even give a damn about huge property loses the city faces with his heroic stunts. Thats Hancock for all of you!. This is a brand new super hero with a twisted mind and weird lifestyle. Its really good to see some one not coming out of a comic book as an adaptation. So, all you other super heroes get aside...here comes the Hancock.What is interesting about this movie is that none of the promotions were focused on highlighting any of his heroic side. A hero is some one who fights for justice and his people but here, nothing like that. That triggered lot of excitement and a new set of fan-following for this super hero. Well, I'm also one of them! I admit I am a big fan of Will Smith as an actor and as a person but this is primarily because he is a real hard working, dedicated and confident individual. A hero in reality. The best part about Willie is that you really see and feel the efforts he is putting into his work.Like any other super hero movie, this is not about fighting with a super villain and his mission to conquer the world but self exploring of an individual with extra powers. And thats why I like this movie. Something different. The director and script writer has done a good job narrating it. Movie is technically very advanced with some amazing special effects like Willie throwing the whale back in to the water, catching some junkies who have stolen money from a bank, all his flying scenes, stopping the train and fighting with Charlize Theron.The story starts with scenes about how Willie's boozing all day, catching some freaks, and how people of the city hate him. He is least bothered about any one, not even him self. Story takes a twist when he saved life of a PR guy. This PR guy has nothing exciting in his professional life and trying hard to make a good life with his wife (Charlize Theron) and son. This whole incident of Hancock saving his life hits him with an idea to do a makeover of Hancock. From bad to good, from stubborn to be humble and kind to others, from 'who cares' to 'I care'. Watching this whole shift is the most interesting part of the movie. How he convinces Willie to go for a surrender to police and Willie's inner fight to stay in the custody with out using his powers and how he eventually takes on the role of Hancock- the savior. It's sheer fun watching it all that happening in front of you.Well, there are some instances where I feel Hancock, as a movie, lacks that 100% punch. You think of Superman, Spiderman, Batman or any other super hero and what comes first to your mind is the image of that hero with a unique background score. In case of Hancock, there is no such theme song and that's something the producers could've have done it. Hancock is a new super hero, never thought of, never ever imagined. He has a different style with unexpected attitude and a theme song or a special background music would have helped in establishing a strong image of Hancock in to audiences mind. As I said earlier, its not about fighting with a super villain but still I wanted to see more actions and stunts. Sorry, I can't help it! But its a super hero anyways and everybody likes to see his or her super hero doing loads of action scenes. The movie is brilliantly executed till the climax comes. The reason and explanation of who is Hancock and what relates him with Charlize Theron is just too fast for the audience. Director could have taken little more time in explaining all this by providing more meat and content. Especially when you know that its all about exploring the inner you and what are you made of. This thing is very tricky and how you handle it and explain all this to audience is a real challenge. The name-Hancock, is also bit strange and totally unwanted. I couldn't believe it when I heard this name for the first time! Why Hancock? try something more edgy with more substance loaded with some punch.It's a sheer excitement watching Willie as a super hero and joining the league of Batman and Superman. You will always get appreciation on doing new things with lot of hard work and ideas put into your work. Same with Hancock. Audience have liked Hancock and his fan-following will grow day by day to give much needed hype for his second stint on 70mm silver screen. Just to add, Willie almost looks like Paresh Rawal (One of India's greatest character artists) in the poster where they are showing a close-up of Hancock's face wearing dark sun-glasses. Its like Babu Bhai of Hera-Pheri wearing shades instead of his typical glasses!! For those who do not know who is Babu Bhai, suggest you should watch a movie called 'Hera-Pheri' with subtitles.In the end, here's a big round of applause on behalf of all Willie fans waiting arms wide open to give him one tight hug! Welcome on board Hancock.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Would be good B-movie,"Well now I think someone should stop giving money that let's Will Smith make any movie he damn pleases.It was OK for Bad Boys, that ain't so bad action flick, Independence day we survived somehow but with consequences worse than alien in a movie put up with.But this?! What in the name is this all about?! Why did anyone gave money for this to be made? It is supposed to bring sort of fresh look at superhero movies. Maybe on a paper it all makes sense but choosing Will as main actor, that is where things went wrong. Heck Will acts same in every movie. That separates good actors from bad ones in a first place. If you wish to explore new concept in a movie you have to bring in actor that can carry that concept damn excellent, otherwise it will just ruin it like in this movie.To be fair Will is not only thing wrong here. Jason Bateman is also so irritating beyond description.Only thing fairly good are CGI effects.Rest is utter crap.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"I dont like super heroes or Smith after that ..erm, but this is an easy 7!","Firstly, I used to really like Smith, a lot. Until ""that"" incident where I felt he let us down, mainly because he didnt have the good grace to leave immediately after the incident, his arrogance bothered me. So I decided not to watch any of his stuff again. In a childish boycott.Secondly I find superhero movies DULL!! Its always the same story no matter who the superhero is. The marvel universe tried to kill cinema so I am amazed superhero movies are still viable.So this movie has 2 ticks against it...and yet I still score it a 7.5.I hadnt seen it in about 10+ years and due to my Smith boycott I very nearly turned it off when it was on the other night. I am glad I never.Its hard to talk about this movie without giving anything away. But lets try.No, Its not really a superhero movie but it does have superheroes in it doing superhero stuff.Yes It has goodies and baddies in it.No, its not really a comedy but it does have comedy in it.Yes, it is a redemption story of sorts.All the negative reviews about this film have the same things in common...they dont like it because they were expecting a superhero comedy movie, like Deadpool. Its not.All the positive reviews also have some thing in common, they were pleasantly surprised by the actual story. Which is not really about superheroes.Yeah there are a few plotholes and iffy connections but its a great story told very well.There is a scene that brings a tear to my eye every time. Not as much as much as an affair to remember but its an enjoyable piece of cheese none the less.Give it a go. Its not deep, groundbreaking or Deadpool. But its a nice film hidden inside a poorly written superhero comedy.Its a 7.5 from me.Oh and dont expect Smith to be too Smithlike. He kind of dials this one in. But he doesnt need to be razor sharp in it either so it doesnt really matter.As a side note, personally Smith should have got an Oscar for I am Legend. Not a perfect film but he showed great acting. He was terrible in King Richard, the film he actually got an Oscar for and the story was rubbish too. There are 2 dominant Williams sisters.....not that the movie talks about that.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's not bad but not good,"John Hancock, the amnesiac super hero people love to hate, good concept, but it was a bit on the ""so what"" side. The first half hour or so, I found myself to be quite entertained...but come 45 minute mark my mind slowly melted into a fine goop used for cleaning floors with.It was a funny film I'll give you that, which meant it completed what it was set out to do. Will Smith and Jason Bateman gave good performances... but it was Charlize Theron that made my inside curl, her ""Hancock shouldn't be here"" looks were cringe-worthy... not to mention the very elaborate background story between Hancock and her character.One other thing I'd like to point out, is that just after saving one person, everyone who hated him before suddenly forgot all his previous mishaps and a certain $9 million bill of destruction. Either way, it is an enjoyable film, just don't expect to laugh out loud and split your sides....It isn't your average Will Smith film.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Ignore the negative reviews, Hancock is Great and UnExpected !","Here and there, I heard early reviews about the film, still went to the film without any expectations...Simply put, the film is quite good. Will Smith (dude can really carry a film), Charlize Theron and Jason Bateman give worthy performances (Charlize was hot as usual), direction by Peter Berg was good, and story wise it was OK (cool surprises in the plot), but could've been improved on some areas. Some of the dialogue/jokes were good and witty. Overall, had a good, popcorn blast-o-fun with this ""action-comedy-fantasy-drama"" movie.Hancock was gripping, heartfelt, and totally unexpected! you have to go to see ""Hancock"" even if you don't expect a lot from this cause believe me this is movie is a hit !. You would have been surprised if it was Will Smith's first major disappointing film since ""Wild Wild West"". Since there was such high publicity I figured it would fall way short. However, to me I was surprised !! I ended up cheering once the credits rolled. It truly was a captivating story. Yet the CG could have been much better the story is what will stick with the audience and another hit for Will Smith!Entertainment score: 9.8/10Overall Score: 8.75/10",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The big twist completely ruins it,"This was a major disappointment. It's not that it looked like it was going to be fantastic and wasn't. No, the problem is that it was fantastic for about forty minutes, and then it became derailed so completely that it absolutely ruined all of my enjoyment. Will Smith, the king of the Forth of July, stars as a superhero. The gimmick: he's a screw-up and a drunk, and his heroic actions generally cause far more collateral damage than the actual problem he's trying to solve. The public hates him. One day he meets a down-on-his-luck PR expert (Jason Bateman) who has some ideas on how he can improve his image. It's a great premise, but the first thought you might have is, can they stretch it out to at least 90 minutes without breaking it? I honestly think the answer is yes, they could have. Their answer is, no, let's throw in an insanely idiotic twist that changes the film from a hilarious action-comedy to a dark, romantic superhero picture. I knew as soon as I saw Charlize Theron in the film that they were saving her character for some big twist, as the advertisements for the movie didn't include a single shot of her. You don't hire an actress that big and not give her something important to do. They had something so great here. The first half of it had me laughing out loud frequently. I've been waiting for Hollywood to skewer superhero movies intelligently ever since Batman Begins, where Batman's chase with the police causes millions of dollars of damage. I know it was pretty much universally hated, but My Super Ex-Girlfriend covered similar territory and, while it was never great, it didn't screw up anywhere near as royally as Hancock did.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Likable, though lightweight, superhero send-up","This film came out the same year as ""Iron Man,"" which started off the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I think this clever send-up of superhero films should have come out later, when it could have been a commentary/satire of the now very played out superhero film. This story has Will Smith as an grungy, alcoholic superhero who will fly in to save the day for various situations, but does so drunkenly, haphazardly, and always with wild amounts of property damage. That is until he saves the life of PR man Jason Bateman who offers to help Hancock with an image makeover. It's a clever script by Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan, from an earlier script by Vincent Ngo, though at it's heart it's still a lightweight summer comedy. Smith and Bateman are both quite likable, and Charlize Theron is good, though underused, as Bateman's wife. Directed by Peter Berg, who did the terrific movie and TV versions of ""Friday Night Lights,"" but who also the insipid board game film adaptation ""Battleship,"" delivers solid action and likable characters, which is better than you get in most summer blockbuster films.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Peter Berg's Camera-work,"You know, you get those great director's with good camera men like Larry and Andy Wachowski or Steven Spielberg , and even Jon De Bont....but Peter Berg just needs to hold that camera still, it's always moving around and stuff....it's really annoying, no offense.... ""Hancock"" just might look a little better if those cameramen could hold the camera steady you know. I don't like those movies that the director just tosses and turns the camera around so you can't even see the action and good stuff clearly. Like ""the Bourne identity trilogy"". Those films tic me off with the camera bouncing all over the place... even when there is no movement in the characters and they're just sitting and talking, the camera is still bobbin around! cut it out Pete....we got enough of that stuff in ""The Kingdom"". It isn't a unique style anymore! it's sloppy and messy and my eyes hurt!",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Will Smith saves Los Angeles (is he downsizing?),"Will Smith as the Superhero who needs a makeover. Its entertaining and has a slight twist half way through. Definitely worth watching but don't expect too much.Hancock despite regularly saving people is hated by the public and the police. The police are actively asking him to butt out of rescues as he ends up damaging property when he does any rescues. Oh and he hates being called an ""asshole"" (a bit like Mcfly from back to the future).One almost wonders why he bothers and from the opening scenes it appears that he doesn't always bother.

disappointing,"I was hoping to see another entertaining movie from Will Smith. This movie was disappointed me on all fronts. Biggest disappoint was the plot (or lack of plot). Some of the other issue with this film are not enough action, lacking in details, strong CGI, average acting. Will Smith was OK but rest of the crew as disappointing. I wished for more background on the characters, they never build up to the story.

Spoiler Alert -- IMDb's lackluster tagline gives away movie.,"Best movie in the last decade? Nah. Best Will Smith movie? Nah. However, it is a good, solid film with a bit of a different look at the superhero genre. I find it very interesting that it is so obvious that the gathered masses cannot simply enjoy that. Hell, it was hugely more enjoyable than Watchmen, which I gave away after one viewing.Frankly, I think that IMDb falls flat reviewing this film. Their outlook is pretty unoriginal. Their storyline is badly written at best as well. Also, how they could not add ""comedy"" as a genre keyword for this film mystifies me. I could go on for quite a while, but I want to concentrate on one part for a moment: But what interests me most is that IMDb threatens users with being permanently blacklisted {""If you write a spoiler without warning readers, your name will be added to a blacklist and all your future reviews will be discarded automatically and unread.""}. Why, then, have they dropped a spoiler as the tagline? I tried out this movie on the recommendation of a friend, not knowing much more than that this fellow sounded like a nasty, alcoholic ""Greatest American Hero"" who happened to be black. I was happy enough to sit down and chuckle through that.Then I checked the page for a piece of trivia, and saw that tagline and crappy storyline. IMDb had me shaking my head every five minutes going ""Ah, crap, when is going to have an affair with the guy's wife -- he would be such an ass, and the husband really loves his wife..."" Give this film a chance, boys and girls. There's a bit more out there than what you've been led to believe, spoilers and all.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Refreshing superhero movie,"Hancock has been on my watchlist since I really started liking Will Smith, which was about a year ago. When I finally managed to watch it, I didn't know much about it, apart from it being hopefully a different kind of superhero movie.At first the movie feels refreshingly simpler compared to the epic superhero movies we keep getting. It felt like most of the idea came from how in those epic superhero movies the heroes cause a lot of damage to the city and its people. But as the story goes forward the story does become richer and, even if I hate the word, more epic.It's refreshing to see a character like Hancock. He is like an asshole, clearly an antihero (it's already refreshing not to see a brooding white man antihero, mind you), but there's more to him. And what's important we actually can see how he feels about the people kind of hating him, even if he tries to save them. It's not just superficially shrugged off.I also love how the music is used so well with the story. When the movie becomes more like a superhero movie the soundtrack feels more like a classic score for that type of movies.Hancock is an entertaining and a surprisingly good superhero movie. I think I would've preferred something simpler, something more refreshing, but Hancock is good for what it is. Of course it's a bit typical, but it has several new elements, and it has great cast. And while the story is not great, there are a lot of things I like about it. Hancock definitely is worth seeing whether or not you are tired with the typical Marvel or DC movies we get.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Give it some slack this was entertaining and underrated,"Don't get me wrong here...this is not the greatest superhero movie of all time but its definitely refreshing. It takes the side of a superhero in a darker, comedic, adult version, and almost more realistic/relate-able side. It shows that even superheros aren't perfect which is honestly a great idea and great side to show. Hancock is basically a non-perfect superman. He has a drinking problem, doesn't care what people think of him, and has personal issues. This allows normal people like us to relate to someone who basically is an all powerful God, and lowers him down to be more on a human level, which again is refreshing and key word: DIFFERENT!After watching other cheesy, totally unfathomable, even for superhero movies, its takes a different viewpoint on what problems a superhero could face if they were in fact real, which gives it a more realistic feel to it. Will Smith also is great, hands down greatest actor of all time and if you don't agree....don't watch movies. He can play any role.But OK i will admit at the end it got kind of weird and I had my doubts because of the story that unfolds, but then when I saw the great acting and how much pain and sadness you could feel while watch Will and Charlize Theron, who have great chemistry together rooting from the Legend of Bagger Vance, it immediately took away my doubts and took the movie for what it is. The producers had a goal and accomplished it. This movie is very good but by no means great. Its very funny at times and very dramatic at times using realistic viewpoints in a very unrealistic world.

I don't care how charming Will Smith is...,"...this is the worst film of his since ""Wild Wild West"". Seriously.

Now this won't ruin his career, but Will you owe us......for sitting through an hour and a half of shaky camera that was better for independent movie-making, $150 million special effects that looked like they cost half as much, a few funny jokes but a bunch more that weren't, and a laughable 'twist' that made the whole story hokey and well, let's face it, stupid.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"If you are even mildly a comic book fan, I'd recommend it","There are lots of stories about what if Superman wasn't raised by perfect Stepparents, and turned out to be a bit of a jerk (most recently The Boys). Looking back on this after 10 years, I think it is underrated. This may be a typical action/comedy/sci-fi Wil Smith fare but charming in many ways. Jason Bateman is really the heart of this film. His sincerity as a PR guy who wants the change the world and Hancock's image is pretty lovely. His coaching sessions are terrific. . The story arc is a bit predictable but fun. Charlize Theron is less entertaining but as bankable as ever. Effects hold up well, even today. Much of what is suggested off camera, instead of on, really adds to this FX longevity. If you are even mildly a comic book fan, and who isn't these days, I'd recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
So much wasted potential,"OK seeing Will Smith movie ""Hancock"" my expectations were quite high having heard great things over the last few years about this being an under appreciated ""gem"" of a film....The premise behind the film certainly had enough promise and potential. It had a ""something new"" and fresh appeal to it. We also had arguable the biggest box office star going attached to the films title character, so it surely going to be an awesome spectacle and the hit of the summer.Well I can't quite comment wither or not the film will be the box office smash of the year, but I certainly can state in my opinion that it AIN'T the ""awesome spectacle"" I initially thought it could be. So what went wrong?The film has no soul, from the very start to the ending credits the film feels empty. No emotion attached to the project, no feeling of awe. Can't quite put my finger on the spot but something major was lacking in the movie experience for the viewer regarding the overall feel of the flick.No character arc's worth mentioning, I know we are supposed to not be that keen on the Hancock character, but there must be something in the character that we will grow to love. There ain't, Hancock has an effect flat-line arc. This is exactly the same with the other major players in the movie. Nobody gets developed fully or even slightly throughout the rather short 90 minutes or so running time.The score was also terrible, from start to end.The Superhero back story again was extremely weak.Villains were so weak, we didn't really need anybody with super-powers to deal with them.The first half or so of the movie was at least enjoyable popcorn fun, but the latter half was particularly weak. When the film became ""serious"" when the drama kicked off the film just became severely lost. It lost structure, it didn't know what genre it wanted to be, action, drama, continued comedy or suspense. Unfortunately for the viewer it was none of them so just became pointless and irritating. They really should have padded out the idea of the first 45 minutes with some more evolved ideas from the part of the story and we might well have had a good movie. Unfortunately they didn't and they padded the film out with a tangent story-line that made no coherence or sense.There are positives, Will Smith for what he had to play with was as usual entertaining to watch. The Jason Bateman character was likable and also enjoyable to watch, well up until the third act when he frittered away to a cardboard cutout. Special effects were more than adequate, and at times quite spectacular. There was also a few laugh out loud moments, particularly the Youtube scenes.Overall this film had so much potential, this movie could have and should have been great, but unfortunately it was very poorly handled and executed. The blame must fall down to the direction, and script.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Also Jason Bateman and Will Smith have some great dialogue together.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Hancock vs. Inadequacy, drugs, booze and ultimately himself","This movie could've been better, and with the lack of a strong second act it just ends up being slightly above average. The opening scene with Hancock drunkenly waking up from a bender after a kid informs him of a shootout between cops and Asian gang members during a high speed pursuit sets the tone for the style of crime fighting Hancock undertakes. Before leaving his park bench, he gropes at a random woman and grabs his liquor to go take on the bad guys. He does stop the gang members but not without causing a huge amount of collateral damage to buildings, roads and presumably injuries to people unlucky enough to be caught in his drunken highway showdown.Hancock meets Ray Embry, a corporate image consultant, when he saves Ray from a collision from an oncoming train at a railroad crossing. Hancock tosses Ray's car upside down to get it off the tracks and derails the train as well. Hancock is invited by a grateful Ray back to his house for dinner, where he meets Ray's wife and son. He is slowly convinced by Ray to turn himself into the police to stand trial for the collateral damage caused by his heroics.Hancock goes to a maximum security lockup with the assumption that crime will escalate quickly enough for Los Angeles to want Hancock released. He slowly sobers and is released to help police confront a group of heavily armed bank robbers and rescue a wounded officer. The second act deals with the origin of Hancock's powers and the attempts by one of the former bank robbers and several other inmates placed in jail by Hancock to get revenge. It descends into a maelstrom of CGI-crafted battles and a vague mythological origin to compensate for lack of a decent back story. The idea of a superhero with struggling with alcoholism and rehabilitating his image sounds but this suffers suffers from weak character development and some shoddy acting from Charlize Theron. Will Smith is good as Hancock, but that isn't saying much since he just seems either exhausted/hungover or emotionally distant through most of the movie. Jason Bateman gives a good performance as the nice guy trying to do a friend a favor, and this is considering he's usually the straight guy in these Frat Pack movies lately.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Ludicrous spin on the super hero mythology is saved by winning performances by Smith, Bateman, Theron, and some hilarious LOL moments!","This film tries to put a new spin on the super hero, creating an anti-super hero, very well played by Will Smith, and his journey to redemption thanks to a down on his luck salesmen, a terrifically sympathetic Jason Bateman. While the concept is clever, even with suspension of disbelief there are still an awful lot of plot holes.However, what saves the film are great performances, and a tongue firmly enough in cheek to make a subtle nod to the audience that the film's knows and embraces its own ludicrousness. It then has the balls not to care because the cast are clearly having a lot of fun and as the story moves along there are some very amusing set pieces and some huge laugh out loud moments, the best being Hancock's first run in with some prisoners when he voluntarily surrenders himself to the authorities for his own past misdeeds. Theron is also good value as Bateman's wife, and reason's for the character's guarded personality will reveal themselves as the story progresses, though this plot development ends up being a huge contrivance to help sustain the film's concept as at about the halfway point it begins to run out of steam. In fact the films story then veers off at a tangent and becomes a very different film as the climax is surprisingly grounded and intimate, and at this point the films suddenly, and somewhat out of the blue hits you with a face-full of pathos. Weirdly enough this actually seems to work dramatically and pulls you along to the end of the film, which then signs off with a few more very funny set pieces.Technical credits are first rate, with some impressive and very funny visual effects, provided by a team of companies led by veteran outfit Sony Pictures Imageworks and veteran Oscar winning Supervisor John Dykstra. Editing and music work well for the film and Peter Berg's direction is self-assured and confident enough to allow the film to zip past fast enough for you to almost overlook the plot contrivances and holes. However, the film's original theatrical cut is the much better version, and the directors extended version is notably inferior, particularly early on when scenes are either unnecessary, overtly gross and evenly shockingly disturbing and I am sure would have meant an R rating for the film had it been released. Had this been the original version of the film, it would have made it much more difficult for the audience to empathise with the lead character as some parts of the story in this cut of the film actually turn you off the character in a very big way.In summary then, a silly plot compensated for by a film that is genuinely exciting, funny and for the most part very entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Ignore the naysayers!,"Obviously, from reading the reviews on this movie, you don't have to have opposable thumbs to write a review...just a computer! So here are my two cents on the movie Hancock.GO SEE IT!The special effects are NOT cheesy (if you want CG cheese, watch any of the blockbuster Spiderman Movies), and the ending DOES NOT spoil the beginning. The flow of events does indeed turn from lighthearted to serious, but that's where the story-line takes us and it does so quite smoothly and logically. All of the characterizations in this movie are spot on and Jason Bateman almost steals the show from Will Smith which is no mean feat since he plays a suit wearing everyday middle of the road nice guy to a booze swilling whale tossing property wrecking Hancock. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. Hopefully you'll be like me and ignore the naysayers. So shut-up and eat your popcorn!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not completely terrible,"I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't slightly disappointed. Now the movie had an intriguing premise of a superhero that's not adored for his actions because of their destructive nature but it's not really a premise that's out of a superhero fans thought process. It had a pretty simple story and nothing that really made its plot stand out in any way other than the fact that Charlize Theron's character had powers too (which isn't even a spoiler if you saw the same original trailer I did) and that she claims that there were other super humans in the past but had since died off after pairing up and losing their immortality. But one thing that I wanted to ask the writers and director was, ""Why?"". Because I wanted to know why Hancock didn't care about the collateral damage he was causing. Why Mary (Theron) hated Hancock after he got injured because it's not like he intended to forget her. And she seemed to like him quite a bit before that happened so why now? And as for the criminal who wanted Hancock dead, not a good centered villain since he wasn't there for half of it. And as for all the other idiots who try to shoot Hancock, you think one of them would realize that he's indestructible and others have tried that. But all in all, Hancock is anything spectacular, but it'll get you through part of an afternoon with nothing to do.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Woeful Drivel,"Like many, i was seduced by the trailers for this movie, the reality left me mind numbingly disappointed. Lead actors Will Smith and Charlize Theron, a big budget and a good idea should give any Director a good head start, Peter Berg squanders it all in an unimaginative disaster.The script is cliché ridden and formulaic,and the ""happy moon"" ending vomit inducing. In trying to straddle the comedy, action and superhero genres it falls flatly on its ""ass"" (sic). The ""action"" sequences are occasionally quite disturbing for a uk 12a certificate.Now I enjoy my Peckinpah and Tarrantino along with the best. however the convention for this certificate film is that the violence is ""comic book"".The opening sequence of hoodlums spraying a busy freeway, among which are chasing cops, with Uzi sub-machine gun rounds (several hundred a minute)is not Comic strip.The same is true when a Bank is held up and the robbers sprays the busy street with Uzi, heavy calibre machine gun and what looks like an RPG fire.Equally is having women and children wired up to Hamas style explosive vests funny? America has a serious problem with lone young gunmen and random massacres. The naive sanitization of these sequences helps no-one.Supporting actor Jason Bateman looks as uncomfortable as the part is, as part of the ""triangle"" between himself,Theron and Smith. The use of the formers ""child"" for the most excruciating ""kid"" moments are frankly excruciating.The cinema was pretty full, I heard no-one laugh out loud once. the idea of a ""flawed"" superhero is a good one. In the future it has the basis for a good film in the hands of some capable writers and a talented Director.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Inconsistent but Manages to Entertain,"From what I understand, this movie went through a lot of trouble and changes during the production process. I can believe it, as the movie feels sort of erratic and can't seem to keep its focus. The film follows the title character, an alcoholic (and generally unloved) superhero in Los Angeles who is more famous for his careless destruction than his heroic acts. After saving the life of a public relations representative, Hancock begins to refine his image in hopes of becoming the hero the city needs.At least, that's what the first half of the movie is about. If the entire movie had focused on this one storyline and fleshed it out more, I think it would've been a vast improvement. Instead, the movie completely shifts gears halfway through into a story about Hancock's origins and how it's come to affect his life and those he's met. Rather than making two good movies out of these elements, the filmmakers opted to make one decent (though mediocre) movie with everything crammed into a little more than 90 minutes. It also seemed as if the movie couldn't decide on whether it wanted to be a light-hearted, fun superhero flick or a deeper, emotional drama about seeking acceptance. In short, the film feels inconsistent in content and the most enjoyable elements are the few action scenes and the performances of the main cast.Of course, Will Smith was a great lead for the film (as has come to be expected). The man's over-loaded with charisma and you can't help but love his character, even when the character is as reckless and resentful as Hancock. Even with such an average movie, Smith manages to shine through. Jason Bateman is Ray Embrey, the PR agent who makes it his mission to help Hancock become a real hero; he was an ample supporting player to Smith and brought a kind-hearted naivety to his role. Personally, my favorite performance in the film was Charlize Theron as Mary, Ray's wife. I won't say much about her character because it falls too easily into spoiler-territory but I thought she was great (especially in the final act of the film).Plot and pacing issues aside, this film does manage to entertain. It has a tendency to drag in some moments but the cast keep the whole movie afloat. While there aren't a whole lot of action scenes, the few that exist are great. It's worth a viewing though don't go out of your way for this Will Smith summer action flick.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Could Have Been Better, But Still Quite Entertaining","The basic premise of this film is a fascinating one that really has never been explored in mainstream films: what happens when a bona fide superhero ends up being more trouble than he is worth? This is exactly the case with Will Smith's Hancock, who (although saving lives) also wreaks tremendous damage to the city and is a dirty, stinking alcoholic. Thus, the ""hook"" of this film involves Hancock trying to rehab his sullen, non-caring image after meeting a PR consultant on one of his ""rescue"" missions.What works in this film is the theme of ""superhero gone bad"". Coming on the heels of ""The Dark Knight"", which really toyed with the definitions of heroes and villains, ""Hancock"" takes that theme to a whole new level, as he is a terrible person in every way besides the fact that he saves a few lives every once in awhile. Thus, the most entertaining portions of this film occur as Hancock tries to learn the delicate balance between being a role model and still being ""cool"" at the same time. Early in the movie, Hancock's loneliness is so readily observed that one can believe he will try anything to gain some respect or friendships.On the other hand, I thought that the reveal of where Hancock is actually from was a bit lacking. The build-up to his origins are fantastic (as his scattered memories contribute mightily to his apathy towards being ""good""), but the reveal leaves much to be desired. In all honesty, I still don't exactly know what/who Hancock is with much certainty. More fleshing out of that angle of the storyline may have pushed this film to a five-star rating from me.Overall, Hancock is a very entertaining movie...and really, what more can you ask for?! Despite being a bit lacking in Hancock's character history, the film DOES provide some great action scenes, multiple moments of comedy, and an original storyline that will make you personally feel for the tormented ""superhero"".",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good Action Flick But Flawed as a Complete Film,"Hancock is your typical summer-action flick; it contains fast-paced, exciting scenes, a lot of comedy, and a great twist in the plot.Will Smith, the protagonist, plays the part well as a lonely superhero. He is a natural at completely getting into the role of his character. Hancock is portrayed as a likable, funny individual that is looking for a purpose.Jason Bateman's character seemed kind of dry and plain, but he and Will Smith had some on-screen chemistry in a few of the scenes. Charlize Theron did well with her part. Whenever her character met Hancock for the first time, the audience can sense the underlying tension from her, which is a major part in the film.The film was enjoyable, but the movie contained some plot holes that needed to be addressed and further explained. The climax was mediocre, and the villains weren't up to par. They didn't exhibit the typical characteristics of an antihero.Fortunately, the action and comedy in this movie appeals to the viewer. If you want to watch Will Smith fly around and attempt to save the day, then this movie is highly recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A hero being saved.,"The story starts presenting Hancock as a hero who does more does more damage than keeping people. Hancock presents himself to the world as the superhero who is strong, takes on a thousand bullets at one stand and smashes everything in his way, do not give a damn about what others things about his action.But, for himself, he is a broken man with some skills which barely fill his plate and an alonely human who is confused about who he is where he was and where he should be headed.But, one day he save a random PR expert named Ray Embrey who was about to be hit by a train in a car, by stopping a train and flipping his car, doing huge damage to the train and nearly injuring Ray and a few others. Though people disgust him for this action Ray stands for Hancock and thinks to repay him for saving his life by helping him to gain what he truly wanted, to be accepted and loved as a true superhero.At the end of the first half yes, Hancock becomes the hero he wants. But love is a double sword for him. Though it saves him from being a miserable anti-hero, it weakens him and drags him to his knees, and to be saved again. In the end, Hancock has to make a difficult choice.The movie might not fit the typical heroic movie nor does it have every best movie characteristic. But, I enjoy the idea of ""A superhero being saved by a regular human"" and ""you do not need superpowers to do good in the world, just start changing a single life, it could lead to saving the entire world.""",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Caught at the Warning Track,"Hancock was an attempt at something different in super hero genre. And it deserves applause for this. Instead of focusing on an earth threatening villain the film focuses on the villain within the hero.The superhero by make not by consensus, Hancock (Will Smith), fights bad guys when he feels like it. He does as much damage to the city he's in as to the bad guys he stops. The majority of the civilians of the city view him as a cause of disturbance rather than a preventer. Hancock has accepted this general opinion and does not care to change it until one of the people he saves, Ray (Jason Bateman), wants to help him.The film has a great premise and does well for the majority of the movie in executing it. However, the movie falters when it attempts to tell Hancock's past and bring it to the forefront. The movie had a great thing going but when the ball was almost out of the park, it got snagged on the warning track.Hancock is still a fun movie to watch, but you will most likely be disappointed with where the writers take the story. Will Smith delivers a top notch performance that is vastly under rated. He gives life to the character and made the viewer care about his plight. This film is worth renting or watching on TV, but it's not one for the collectors shelf.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Two descent actors can't make up for an awful script,"I am really surprised that Will Smith and Charlize Theron accepted to take part in such a movie!After an effort from the writers to include every possible genre in one movie, what we get is a disturbingly naive plot and what looks like an endless brainstorming on screen. The script is more like a sum of ideas for different movies than a standalone movie. The writers in their desperate attempt to knit everything together even use an ""After one month"" sequence.The only two positive things about the movie are: the cool and funny Will Smith; and the good- looking Ms. Theron, who delivers a good performance. If they weren't in the leads, this movie wouldn't have made it to the theaters.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not Loved Enough,"Hancock I feel was unjustly criticized because the trailers marketed it as a goofy superhero comedy when in reality, it takes dramatic turns to show the dark side of being the only being with superpowers. However, I feel like it balances tones very evenly. The dramatic parts are very well done, and the comedic parts are hilarious. Hancock is a prime example of why you shouldn't judge a movie based on the marketing.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I've seen worse.,As lots have people have stated the first half is much better than the second. A few laughs to be had. More a Saturday afternoon film with the kids(mine enjoyed it).

Relatively okay movie...,"Sure, I have seen the 2008 movie ""Hancock"" before, once or twice actually, and while I vaguely remembered the storyline, I still opted to sit down and watch it again here in 2023, as I happened to stumble upon it whilst browsing through the movies on Netflix.The storyline in ""Hancock"", as written by Vy Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan, is an adequately entertaining one. It certainly was, and still is, refreshing to have a superhero-themed movie with a flawed superhero. The whole goodie-two-shoes thing that is the concensus of superheroes grows a bit stagnant after a while, and that is why these flawed superheroes, such as Hancock, prove to have a wider appeal.The acting performances in ""Hancock"" are good, and they had a good cast ensemble to portray the various characters in the storyline. Much can be said about Will Smith, but he does carry the movie quite well and makes it all the more enjoyable to watch. The movie also have the likes of Charlize Theron and Jason Bateman in leading roles, so there are some familiar faces on the screen.Visually then ""Hancock"" is adequate. It wasn't the most impressive of CGI special effects, but they worked. I am not saying that the CGI effects were bad or inadequate, not at all, I just wasn't impressed with the flying sequences.If you enjoy superhero movies, and want something that differs from the usual generic superhero stuff, then director Peter Berg's 2008 movie ""Hancock"" is worth checking out.My rating of ""Hancock"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Muddled & Uneven. Should Have Been Two Separate Stand Alone Movies,"Hancock (2008)I watched the unrated version.The year the MCU started, also saw Will Smith trying his hand at a superhero movie. Hancock is two movies. The first movie is about an anti hero learning to become superhero, and is by far the better of the two. The second movie is more of an origin story, as we learn more about Hancock's past and he finds out he is not alone. Both parts could have worked well as as stand alone movies, but put together its muffled and uneven.The movie shows all the signs of studio interference and never establishes a clear tone. Hancock only works because of Will Smith, whose performance is stronger than what the movie deserves. Don't get me wrong; I don't hate it, it is sometimes funny, sometimes clever, and occasionally enjoyable. Especially the first 50 minutes.Charline Theron is ok, as is Jason Bateman (who basically just plays the same guy he always plays) One of the problems is the lack of any real villain. Red Parker is just a weasel with a gun and is no real threat.Hancock grossed $227 million at the domestic box office to end 2008 the 4th highest grossing movie of the year. Smith highest performing movie since Men In Black.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not what I expected,"This movie was not quite what I was expecting at all. But that isn't necessarily a bad thing.I was expecting more of a generic superhero movie, but what I got was more of a character study than anything else. Hancock isn't so much a superhero as he is an indestructible force, a god if you will, who has just sort of lost the will to care about collateral damage or public image... and on top of that an anger problem to boot. A plot twist is thrown in there to explain his past and moves the plot in quite a different direction than what would be expected, eventually leading up to the inevitable happy ending.I would consider Hancock something like a mix between Spider-Man and The Incredibles, then garnish with a little Will Smith and it makes for a fairly entertaining movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great Movie,"Wow. What a movie. I went in thinking this was just your run of the mill summer action movie, But let me tell you, it is all that and then some.

I'm not going to go into what the movie was about because everyone already knows, but let me tell you, your money will not be wasted on this movie. I laughed, I was wowed by the special effects, and get this, it even brought tears to my eyes more than once. A terrific job by everyone involved. My hat is off to all of you. Thanks.

"This was absolutely funny, funny, funny!!!!!","This movie was funny! I actually own the film and watched it, but I won't spoil the surprise about it. Will Smith is awesome in this film! His first superhero movie, wow! Including Charlize Theron's as well. As a superhero, Hancock has done a lot of destruction in Los Angeles, which is why he is not called your typical superhero. Both Hancock and that woman are sensitive people when someone insults them. It may need to be previewed by parents before any child under 13 can see this film. It may be a little offensive for them to watch. There is language in this film. Sometimes, there is action and could've had more action into it, which would have made it much greater film to watch.Watch this film, it was funny!!!!!!!!!!!!!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
You're a hero...,"During the dramatic arc in ""Hancock"" Charlize Theron's Mary confesses to Will Smith's Hancock, ""You were built to save You're a hero."" ""Hancock"" is an amazing surprise. Charlize Theron is awesome. Her powerful performance elevates ""Hancock"". Will Smith is the most charismatic movie star today, and is well deserved. His power not only derives from his swagger, but also from his humanity and compassion. With the caliber of Oscar Winner Theron and Nominee Smith in a superhero movie by Director Peter Berg, something compelling and special emerges. Along with Smith and Theron, Jason Bateman is terrific. Bateman is having a deserved resurgence coming off of ""Juno"" and here in ""Hancock"". Writers Vy Vincent Ngo and Vincent Gilligan create a new and fresh superhero mythology in ""Hancock"". Director Berg provokes killer performances, and unexpectedly veers narrative direction as ""Hancock"" transforms into the poignant homage to hero. Deep down like Bateman's Ray, we all want to ""Change the world."" Hero resonates to the soul.Hancock (Smith) has Superman-like powers: amazing strength, flight, great speed, and impervious to bullets. However, Hancock is a loner alcoholic superhero with a very bad attitude, and completely reckless. In the opening sequence Hancock subdues Asian gang members in a highway chase that costs the City of Los Angeles $9 million. Fortunately, Hancock saves Ray's life from a freight train accident. The grateful Ray (Bateman) thanks Hancock and invites him home to meet his family. Ray has a young son Aaron (cute Jae Head), who worships the renegade superhero. His beautiful wife Mary (Theron) strangely seems to recognize Hancock.Public Relations guy Ray offers his services to Hancock, who is a PR nightmare. Ray tells him, ""People don't like you, Hancock."" Mary is uneasy with Ray's good intentions. She says, ""You always see the good in people when there is none."" In guarded introspection Hancock agrees to accept Ray's offer. The Superhero image ""makeover"" is not easy. Here Ngo and Gilligan hysterically poke fun at recent celebrity jail stints as means of public sympathy. The process where Ray teaches Hancock to say, ""Good job."" is hilarious.Predictably the true hero in Hancock emerges. Then the story takes a surprising dramatic twist. In a quiet moment Hancock recalls his past and he says, ""I must have been some kind of bastard that no one came back to claim me"" Will Smith has cool gravitas that grounds ""Hancock"". He is a great looking charismatic leading man, with a deceptive poignancy. Charlize Theron is the most strikingly beautiful actress on screen. As an actor she wields such amazing will and power. She can shift from light and whimsical to stark intensity without missing a beat. Watching Smith and Theron together on screen is truly captivating. Their chemistry is electric. Jason Bateman is funny and compelling as Ray. Bateman embodies the soul of a very decent and caring man, who is stronger than he knows.""Hancock"" is about reclaiming one's greatness in the morass of circumstance, and love everlasting. It's about being a hero, and wanting to change the world for good. Director Peter Berg always keeps this theme in the foreground. He balances both a sense of humor and gravity. Berg possesses a great action sense for the dramatic. The bank hostage scene is cool and slick. The final conflict is an epic thrill ride infused with great pathos.I really enjoyed and cheered for ""Hancock"". It is a great hero story. ""Hancock"" is inventive, fresh, and completely entertaining. Will Smith powerfully delivers. Charlize Theron is totally amazing. Definitely, see ""Hancock"".",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Good Superhero and A Very Bad Superhero,"I just saw an early screening of Hancock last night, so it's safe to  assume the version I saw will be the closest to what will actually be  on film.  ""Hancock"" promotes itself to be a different type of superhero film, but  by the end of the film, and especially by the last 30 minutes, it  degrades into nothing more than a typical summer blockbuster cliché.  The script does so many contrived turns that it becomes a little hard  to believe, even for a summer superhero film.  Here's the lowdown of what I think:  The Good: - Will Smith is always golden as an actor. It really does  become impossible to hate Hancock because Smith injects him with a  certain level of charm; additionally, Charlize Theron at least adds a  little bit of marginal tension; she's pretty easy on the eyes in all  her movies, and this is no exception  - The beginning action scene and another one in the middle of the film;  since the film really doesn't have that great of a CGI job, the action  scene really have to play up for humor; most of them are flat, but the  beginning one where he chases a car on the freeway, and another one in  the middle where he is engaged in a tug-of-war with another character  (I won't say who) is pretty funny and engaging  -AWESOME score. At times, the melodramatic nature of the film is saved  by the fact that the score is really epic and sweeping; it's pretty  easy to get lost in the film  -A really funny scene in the film where a national pundit chews Hancock  out; I'll let you see it to get the full laugh  -A cool twist that happens 45 minutes into the movie that actually adds  about 20 minutes of intrigue  The Bad: - A load of contrivances that are really convenient. Like  the Superman films, Hancock needs to make a lot of hard-to-believe  turns. Hancock really does not pull it off well enough.  - Bad CGI. Despite the $150 million price tag, the version I saw had a  lot of unfinished or really bad-looking CGI  - The cool twist. As good as it is, it takes a load of time to get  to it, and whatever happens before it just feels like its treading a  lot of water  - A horrible third act. Don't be fooled by the trailers. It's a summer  film; not a P.T. Anderson film. Of course it's going to  end with a nice little bow on top.  - Although Justin Bateman was a pretty fun character in Peter Berg's  previous film ""The Kingdom,"" he's pretty much dead weigh here. Don't  get me wrong. I love him, but he feels necessitated by the plot and his  character is really one-dimensional next to everyone else.  - Dumber than dumb villains. Instead of giving Hancock a strong  antagonist, they rely on a couple of prison hoodlums and common crooks  to fight Hancock. Without a really good central villain, there is never  much worry that Hancock will be challenged against these guys.  - Cheesier than Cheddar ending. The ending is so vomitingly saccharine  (with horrible CGI) that I really have to call the filmmakers out on  this.  So, by the end of the film, I just thought ""Hancock"" was superficially  entertaining with only a few moments of truly redeemable good times.  Like most of Will Smith's films, it's a great idea. It just wasn't  executed very well.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hoping for a Hancock 2!,I can't believe people rated this as less than film. I can't believe it's been so hard to find it on DVD too. This is like the best film nobody saw. I never would have known it was out at all if not for a preview from another film rental. Bizarre.GOD JOB Will Smith! Peter Berg- the cinematography was on fire. The music & effects... hit the mark every time. Potent quick moving story that left you thinking more. I hope to see a sequel with Charlize. Wish there were more superheros like Charlize Theron when I was a girl but better late than never. I think this film is going to be a sleeper hit the way Fisher King was. The message is strong enough and if it went over people's heads that's all the more reason you ought to watch it again. The unrated version is the best. Go on. Watch it again.,,Anonymous,Fantasy
A new brand of superhero,"Hancock is certainly your abnormal or unordinary superhero... a reluctant superhero. Whereas most anyone with the powers he possessed would be clamouring for fortune and fame, he tried his best to shy away from the lime light.What I liked most about Hancock, the movie and the character, was Hancock's grittiness. They made him a complete unrefined, alcoholic, foul-mouthed a-hole that had an attitude of giving the finger to the world. That persona really worked, or I should say that Will Smith did it well. It was apparent that he didn't care for anyone and he only helped when it was absolutely needed, or when he felt that he was obliged to do so.The story also had a pleasant surprise in it that wasn't the least bit hinted to in the plethora of trailers. Besides Hancock's internal and external transformation, a lot of light was shed on the story via Mary Embry (Charlize Theron).The CGI was good as was expected. It is kinda funny because the same CGI five years ago would have been awesome, but what was awesome in 2003 is expected today.Overall the movie was above average. There were some haha funny moments and some sensitive moments as well. It didn't wow me enough to consider it a great movie, but it was definitely worth the price of admission.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Weird...good weird or bad weird? Up to you,"Either the director or the script writers must've been high when they were creating this one. As I write this, I wish to be able to write more than a few lines, but after that first line, anything else seems to be redundant.Throughout the movie you keep wanting to ask ""what?"" over and over. Perhaps if you put the story on paper it wouldn't read too bad, but the execution thereof seems to be a little trickier. A question arises whether some scenes and lines were really necessary. Surely there's something more useful to be said and shown at that time. The plot is not complicated but nonetheless twisted, and at every turn the inertia wants you to go one way, but the movie has already decided to go the other. Because of all the turns even the acting of the high rollers comes under strain.The idea of a bum superhero sounds really good. So many places to go with it.Have you ever met a homeless man? There is a certain familiar look and behaviour: a lack of self-confidence, crusty lips and perhaps a broken walk from the drug effects. Will Smith, as good of an actor as he is, does not show this behaviour at all. The actor's ego is written on his face. He can't not be charming. He is fit. With other words, he looks like Will Smith dressed as a homeless man costume rather than an actual homeless man.Perhaps it would have been wise to split the movie in two and make two separate parts, with the first one only concentrating on Hancock's journey from a bum to a superhero. It would've been a good movie and much easier to stomach.In any case, what no one can take away from Hancock is that it's a fresh drink of water in the long line of cliché superhero formulas. It's hard to predict what happens next. And with that freshness you still get a good amount of laughs and special effects.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A ""SuperHero"" for the older crowd.","From all the bad reviews i read, i didn't expect a whole lot going into the cinema, but i was wrong. Hancock was a very interesting and different take on the superhero genre and i give the director and writer credit. Like the title of my comment says, it's for the older crowd. The ""profanity"" isn't that bad; a little bit of language and some scenes with Will Smith drinking fairly heavily (if you really want to count that). The action scenes were well done and the effects were fairly polished. The acting performances were decent and the script was pretty well written.HOWEVERThe last half hour or so is completely different from the rest of the movie. It shifts from a light, action/comedy to an intense drama. A villain is thrown in just for good measure, but fails due to lack of time to develop. Apart from that, Hancock was an interesting film which is worth taking a look at.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Will Smith suddenly hates the public and gives us Hancock.,"It turns out that the new Will Smith Summer extravaganza 'Hancock' is actually two films spliced together with all the finesse and care of Dr Joseph Mengele. Half of the 92 minute runtime is a promisingly original concept concerning an ""only one of his kind"" superhero alienated from the rest of society and existing only as a recluse who occasionally shows up in Los Angeles to save its hapless inhabitants. The problem lies in the fact that Hancock frequently conducts his superhero-ing whilst under the influence of a bottle of Jim Beam or two and thus often causes more havoc than he prevents. One sterling example the movie presents early on is when, upon having his sunglasses destroyed by a car full of criminals, Hancock effortlessly lifts the car up and skewers it like an olive on the spire of a nearby skyscraper. Events like this lead to public outcry and Hancock's semi-voluntary incarceration after striking a deal with public relations man Jason Bateman, who vows to help him change his ways after the Übermensch saves his life. Seemingly, the remainder of the film would therefore consist of Hancock's gradual path to redemption, winning back the admiration of the public and possibly experiencing a climactic 'Boss Battle' where Hancock learns some kind of important moral. Although not a particularly groundbreaking road to take and particularly wasteful of the idea of what it could mean to 'play God,' 'Hancock' would remain an interesting little package. Instead, at around the one hour mark, director Peter Berg inflicts a whiplash-inducing U-turn on the audience and embarks on a totally different story arc. Does this mean that it is less predictable? No. Does it mean that Berg destroys the film in much the same way that Robert Rodriguez did with 'From Dusk Till Dawn?' Yes.It is difficult to analyse anything about 'Hancock' without relating it to the second half of the movie, like Will Smith's performance for example. It isn't possible to abhor Will Smith. He exists in the collective unconscious of the world's population as one of the coolest and most likable actors around. The second half of 'Hancock' tries its hardest to change this preconception. Willard (yeah, Tonight With Jonathan Ross IS informative) must have known that the movie couldn't work when he read the script for it, so why did he agree to do it? Does he hate us? He seems to be sleepwalking through much of the film, the antithesis of his role in 'I Am Legend' earlier this year. Also, something I've noticed more and more in the past couple of year is the use of the ""Will Smith Patented Sad Puppy Eyeballs Look"" for whenever Will has to convey a heartfelt emotion. He does it the most in 'The Pursuit of Happiness' but 'Hancock' receives its fair share too. And why is he pouting so much? Constipation, probably.Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron are pretty much the only other characters in 'Hancock,' unless you want to acknowledge the existence of Eddie Marsan as the thoroughly mismatched antagonist, which I don't. He is about as good at acting as Shane Ryder is at singing. Even if 'Hancock' wasn't a mess already, he would totally ruin it. Luckily for him it sucks, which means he merely makes any scene he is in unwatchable. Bateman on the other hand mellifluously occupies space and does nothing more, although you can't help feeling sorry for him around two-thirds of the way through. Considering Charlize Theron's character is responsible for the abrupt twist (well not really, the writers are), it is difficult not to hate her. So don't even try. Just loathe every moment she spends talking, eating, moving or just breathing. It will make you feel better.Just because 'Hancock' features the irrefutable king of the blockbuster does not mean that it is good. At one point our hero asks ""Do I look like I care what people think?"" Clearly, nobody involved in the making of this fiasco does at all.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A brilliant movie if you understand it,This movie is the most realistic movie i have ever seen in my life.It is so down to earth and nothing like the comic book fantasies.It is deeply filled with emotion and reason it is amazing.It is simply the best movie i have seen in probably the last 10 years.Probably because i relate to it in many ways because i too was an outcast by society but not for reasons Hancock had but simply for being different.It didn't matter that i was nice and loving i was still different and that was peoples justification for hating me.It has nothing to do with common sense or the human heart but pure ego.,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"there are complaints to be had, but mostly it's a fun summer action movie","Will Smith is a great star in Hollywood, and it's fun to see him in Hancock work his way with a character who's an ""a-hole"" (don't call him that, by the way, that's the buzz word) for the first half and then starts to open up and not be so much one in the second half. If for no other reason to see the film it's for him and for people like Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron to show what potential they have with their talents; Theron especially reminds an audience every once in a while that she won an Oscar for a reason. And, it's also for the first half of the way through the 90 minute running time a wonderful dark comedy that takes itself seriously but also pokes fun at a superhero who doesn't give a flying f*** and bums around saving people while also drinking his ass off and destroying lots of property.But at some point when the writers decide to develop the mythology of the character, who is apparently somewhat God-like and is immortal under specific circumstances but also has 'another' like him (I won't say who, spoiler), and they don't give it enough time to really sink in after the somewhat 'twist' occurs 2/3 of the way through. And anything humorous in the first half is gone pretty much by near-movie's end, leaving it in the hands of Peter Berg, the director. This was the aspect of Hancock that grated down at me. Berg and his cameraman's style is to usually not bother with things like steadicams or dollys or a camera simply still on a tri-pod or other and to make everything hand-held and wobbly and oddly shot and (in the case of the hospital climax) just awfully lit and shot. It comes off as more-so amateurish than being intense or realistic, and it definitely doesn't fit the kind of movie it's meant to be placed in (i.e. JULY 4TH SUMMER BLOCKBUSTER, hello!) And yet, even with the problems I had, I wouldn't stop anyone from seeing Hancock, as a good way to kill an hour and a half and to enjoy some of Smith's best work to date. He's a charismatic and multi-faceted actor, but his star quality meshes well, and it's a performance that's worth every minute to see he's on screen for. If only the rest of the movie were as good as he and his co-stars.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Disappointing,"The movie's plot wasn't too bad, but the storyline fell apart after the first 45 minutes. It began with a great mixture of comedy and action, follow up with a slow not-too-interesting mid-section of the movie, and end with a love story finish. Not what I expected with the previews portraying an action and humor packed blockbuster. Big surprise when he found his ""wife"" though! I don't want to spoil the movie for those who are interested so let's just say I wouldn't pay to see this movie again. Not one of Will Smith's or Charlize Theron's best movies but if you enjoyed I Am Legend, this movie might be a great one for you.

A Superhero Movie that Doesn't Fly,"Here I am, left speechless by the pure potential of this movie. The storyline, the characters, the secrets... the whole film positively reeks of opportunity. Unfortunately, the theater I was in just, well, reeked. And the experience I had expected going into the movie was not to be found. Instead, I was left with a perfect example of ""What Could Have Been: Hancock."" Now, let me begin by saying that I enjoyed the movie. Will Smith, along with the rest of the cast, creates a great character. The change from down-and-out, drunk Hancock to superhero Hancock, around which the first half of the movie revolves, is done stylishly, and not without a few well-placed laughs. Jason Bateman, playing the part of a Public Relations agent for the ""All Heart"" organization, a ""for the people""-style, charitable endeavor, works wonders on the silver screen. And Charlize Theron, acting as Bateman's wife in the film, adds a sense of mystery that, toward the end of the movie, grows into an attractive, powerful character.The comedy, which many had expected to be the bulk of the movie, is well-placed and effective, though an overabundance of joking at the beginning makes the middle (which housed long stretches of drama) seem drawn out. Smith's portrayal of pre-reformed Hancock is hilariously well done, and he keeps that flair for the comedic throughout the film, breaking the tension where he needs to and reminding the viewers that Hancock is not, by any means, Superman. Bateman's character, Ray Embrey, successfully plays off of Hancock's amusing persona, helping to get the punchline across and adding a few of his own in the process.Unlike the great comedy, however, the action and suspense scenes leave much to be desired. Whenever a point of conflict hits, the camera seems to be a few hundred feet away, watching from a distance as the short, fast-paced scenes flash past. The visual effects are indeed as good as the commercials show, yet Director Peter Berg chose not to use them to their full potential. The suspense lasts mere seconds, the characters exchanging a few quick blows, and the scene ends with one of the opposing parties simply leaves.Unfortunately, the story of Hancock takes after the action. Though many, and I stress that there are many, chances to expand the story reveal themselves throughout the movie, director Berg leaves them untouched. Unanswered questions plague the film almost from the start, and tantalizing ideas of more powerful plot points leave me speechless. Opportunity for greatness runs rampant through every character and every scene. Even, I may add, what could have been a sequel.Overall, Hancock is worth seeing once, not for the action or story but instead the comedy. The idea of a degenerate being the proverbial superhero is well executed by Will Smith, though the rest of the movie falls short. With good acting by the whole cast and a healthy dose of humor throughout the film, I recommend the movie for fans of Smith or Bateman, and superhero movie fans.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Superhero movie with an identity complex,"In the modern era of comic book/superhero adaptation movies, Hancock is an attempt to create an original character and also imbue him with all too human frailties. The resulting film, directed by Peter Berg and starring Will Smith, is entertaining and involving, at times, for it's first two thirds, but fails to wrap things up satisfactorily at the end.As the film opens, we are introduced to Hancock (Will Smith), a man with superpowers, including the ability to fly, invulnerability and super strength. Hancock also has some significant character flaws: he is an alcoholic, appears unkempt and is generally uninterested in putting on a pleasant front for the public, offending almost everyone he comes in contact with. He also has developed a bit of a problem on the legal front, as most of heroic escapades end up with an associated property damage cost, which has resulted in multiple lawsuits, and the L.A. DA wants him behind bars.After saving the life of Ray Embry (Jason Bateman), a public relations professional, from a train accident (in which Hancock manages to derail the train and upset the commuters around him) Embry takes Hancock under his wing and makes him a personal project, with the aim of rehabilitating Hancock's tarnished public image. He invites him to his home to meet his family, including wife Mary (Charlize Theron), who gives Hancock some suspicious looks . . .At the outset, Hancock is an interesting take on the superhero tale, set perhaps in the most real world yet for a film of it's type. Here, as Hancock flies about doing good deeds, he manages to crash into things, tear up buildings, destroy yachts, and, frankly, people don't seem too happy. It is a sad comment on modern society that it is very probable that if a super-hero did exist, this is how he would be greeted by the masses.The script, credited by Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan, features a number of funny segments in the early scenes as Hancock interacts with the public and gives them his devil may care attitude. Hancock is a tortured character, saddled with super-powers and an innate desire to do good, but he also cannot cope with the loneliness of his existence, and so has turned to liquor to try to survive. Will Smith does an exceptional job bringing Hancock to life, making him somewhat likable, simply by being Will Smith, but also not being afraid to show Hancock as the jackass he is at times.However, at the three quarters mark, Hancock suddenly transforms into an almost completely different film and runs off the rails. It moves into a more ""serious"" vein and introduces some borderline metaphysical elements, while also delving into Hancock's origin. But, frankly, this material fails to grab you. Hancock was much more interesting when trying to fight through his rehabilitation, driven by Ray, than the left-turn the plot takes the film in towards the end. Hancock seems to want to drive home a powerful, emotional climax, but it manages to do the opposite, robbing the film of it's strength.Smith, as mentioned before, is the anchor of the film and proves once again what an exceptional actor he is. Hancock largely works because of him, giving Hancock a injured soul, but one that still has good at it's center. Jason Bateman is amusing in the role of Ray, but his family story with Mary isn't anything tremendously special or unique, and Theron doesn't turn in a bad performance, but isn't really given a lot to work with either.If Hancock had stayed the course of it's original ideas, it may have been a strong contender for a great summer movie, but it's abrupt change of focus brings the film to a less than satisfying conclusion, which is a shame.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
You must re-watch this movie!!! Trust me your opinion will change!,"This is a very good movie and ahead of its time. At the time this movie came out I didn't like it and it flopped in the box office. However it came out the same time as The Dark Knight which obviously was so different and outstanding.However after re-watching Hancock after the rise of Marvel and all the Avengers movies, I can't help but feel like they just copied everything about Hancock. In terms of the humour and destruction etc, Super hero movies had never really been like this. I don't know what changed in the way that we started enjoying super hero movies but I watched this movie again feeling like I had just watched a Marvel movie.Even things like The Boys, they pretty much stole some concepts. The whole marketing angle of super hero's, think about it!It's such a shame because I feel like we could have really enjoyed exploring this storyline and this whole universe. I thought Will Smith, Charlize Theron and Jason Bateman were great.Anyone who watched this in 08, trust me go back and watch it again.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
will smith brooding again,I felt he was an emotionless character again like the movie with the undead people. I was unimpressed with his performance in this film. the sudden plot twist was just not believable. I give this film a 3 and a ##Boring## !! on the fun meter. Come on Will Smith! You can do better.Will smith needs to focus on making films that do not put the watcher or the audience to sleep. I did not like this film. I thought they really hyped it up as an amazing idea and film.. and it fell short and fizzled out. I enjoyed I robot. An inventive awesome idea and plot but this film fell flat and was a major let down and disappointment to me. I expected more from a man such as this that has such a good following and billing. Maybe next time he will come up with a better plot for us.,2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Idiots,"The critics are idiots. This was meant as a fun film. If you really look at Will Smith 's or Charlene Theron's faces in the movie, you could really see the agony of the characters.Hancock was just a lonely person who handled his life with an addiction. I could see it in his face. Mary was someone who cared about her family but was sidetracked by Hancock's appearance in her life
All of that was displayed by Smith's and Theron's performances.The critics of the film seem to want to have a camera shot of an Iris growing in the windowsill for an hour. You critics are idiots. Just let a movie be enjoyable. I can't believe you get paid for your input.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Twist on superhero films,"It makes a change from all those pumped up, perfect superheroes as the character of Hancock is drunken, ill-mannered and generally unpleasant in most aspects. The scenes with Will Smith playing his wisecracking best are the most memorable, although Jason Bateman is a good, solid support. The only thing I disliked is the way the film descended into schmaltzy territory in the latter part. In some respects I didn't care what happened to certain characters, it was just the typical Hollywood syrup ladled on. The plot weakened and the scriptwriters obviously thought lots of shoot em up action would compensate - and that's what lets Hancock down. Overall though, its a pretty good film compared to what's on at the moment.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Feels like it's been re-mixed and re-cut over and over again..,"Really, What is the idea with this movie ? It's not that it's poorly financed or lacking a great cast. After watching this, I really can't tell what it was supposed to be.A comedy ? A superhero movie ? A drama ? It left with the feeling that it might initially by filmed and cut in a way which the studio didn't approve of and therefor was re-cut. I might be wrong off course, it all might be intentional.For me, nice actors, nice effects, sure, but it's not very much of a movie. A movie doesn't have to be important or deep. Some of the simple action-stuff can be really entertaining. Sorry to say, for me, this isn't.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Brilliant first half is undone by the second,"Hancock addresses a fundamental question that I've always had about superheroes. How do Superman or The Incredible Hulk tear up city streets, crush cars and smash entire floors off of buildings without being slapped with multi-million dollar lawsuits? The title character of Hancock suffers because of his own super-strength, he can fly in and save a man from an oncoming train but his landing causes a giant hole in the pavement and he totals the train by stopping it with his shoulder. The result is that he is in debt to the city to the tune of $7,000,000 in fines.His destructive nature makes him an irritant to the populace of Los Angeles who might appreciate this good deeds were it not for the destruction he leaves in his wake. When he saves the man from the train he crushes several cars and later when he throws a whale back into the ocean, it crashes into some poor guy's sailboat. The disdain is mutual, Hancock isn't exactly a pleasant soul. He's a homeless drunk with a serious lack of people skills, his attitude stinks and he remains elusive from the police and from the press.A sort-of redemption comes his way in the form of Ray (Jason Bateman), a PR guy who is grateful that Hancock saved him from that train and brings him home for dinner. There he meets the wife, Mary (Charlize Theron) who looks at this man with a certain hatred and son Aaron (Jae Head) who looks at him with fascination. Ray is a man who knows how to spin a good idea into a media blitz and thinks he can do no less for Hancock. He convinces him to do time in prison and disappear from the public eye until the crime rate goes up and they are screaming for him to save them. Meanwhile, he will have time to clean up his life and get himself off the booze.This is a brilliant concept. What director Peter Berg has created is a base reality for a man with extraordinary powers. How would the public react to a superhero who trashes everything in an effort to save their lives? What would be the consequences? What is the real reality of having phenomenal strength and the ability to fly? What are the consequences of both powers when you're a drunk?Most of the film's best moments come from the smaller details like the fact that Hancock can shave the stubble off his chin simply by using his own fingernails. There is a scene in which he teaches a lesson to a kid who has been bullying Aaron by hurling the kid into the stratosphere and another scene in prison when he tells a fellow inmate to stick it where the sun don't shine and then gives him a demonstration. Then there's the date the he has with a woman he picks up in a bar, she wants sex but he warns her that his climatic moment may be more than she can handle.These moments would be nothing without the performance of Will Smith who manages to play this character with more subtlety and originality than it probably deserves. He underplays the role and doesn't go for flashy melodrama. He is smart enough to know that this is a guy who has been kept way from most people so he doesn't play him as needy or particularly lovable.Where the movie steps wrong is in the second half, when it tries to explain Hancock's origins. A secret is revealed that brings his background to light and kills the reality that has been created I the first half.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not Great, Not Bad","Im personally a big Will Smith Fan so I was expecting more than the average audience.The acting per se wasn't bad, but let me just say the story got me kind of confused.The whole 2 being one and them coming from way back in time just dint work for me.Perhaps the script writers took a comedy film too seriously at the end.It would have been better if it was a no brainer entertainment film from beginning to finish.They gave too much for the actors to handle and in the end it just let me hanging and made me watch another movie right away, WANTED.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Surprisingly poignant and human.,"After a terrible marketing campaign, which included less-than-stellar trailers and an awful viral website, I fully expected 'Hancock' to be this summer's colossal trainwreck. I generally like to think I can get a good read from a film before it's released, and the vibes I was getting from 'Hancock' were downright sour. Well, I was wrong. Very wrong. While it's not a great movie by any means, 'Hancock' is a surprisingly potent film with a great, original twist on the superhero brand.Audiences have been given no less than ten superhero blockbusters in only a few short years, each one following a strict playbook. Sometimes it works very well, but we've also had our fair share of stinkers. Perhaps it was only a matter of time before a film explores the other side, and that it may not be greener. Hancock is a loner, an alcoholic, very unpopular, and while he usually nabs the bad guys in the end, he leaves a trail of devastation in his wake. The only one of his kind he tells us, a superhero with a mysterious past.It's this original concept that makes 'Hancock' one of the more refreshing pieces of summer escapism. It's choppy, and at times rather heavy-handed, but it sure is fun and enjoyable. Will Smith takes a character who could have been a one-note bore and does a great job adding a real personal touch that adds a great deal of depth as he battles his inner self. He brings the comedy with him, and it's surprisingly effective. Even the great Jason Bateman finds himself in a great supporting role, and Charlize Theron has her moment to shine as Hancock's dark past is uncovered.'Hancock' takes on the hand-held camera technique, something that I thought would seriously weaken the film. But it actually adds an additional element of reality, a documentary-esquire approach that ends up working in its favor. Peter Berg's personal direction works for a film like this, and he does a decent job splicing 'Hancock' in two. One part comedy, one part action. It leaves a lot to be desired, but a twist that helps us understand Hancock's true nature helps transform this picture into something more poignant and human. I only wish this final cut was longer, allowing 'Hancock' to bring things to a more coherent close.Visually, 'Hancock' is a great achievement. Though there is no clearly defined villain, it could be argued that Hancock is his own worst enemy, the film boils over with an exciting and effects savvy climax that offers one of the better finales of the summer season. It seems to end once it begins to scratch the surface, but for what it is, 'Hancock' is a solid summer blockbuster with more on its mind than your average offering. The humor is there, the story is there, the characters are there, the heart is there, and though it's definitely flawed, 'Hancock' is not bad at all. In fact, it can all be seen as a strange but affectionate look at America's place in the world.More reviews: rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

More than a blockbuster,"A drunken-slob superhero with an attitude bordering on nihilist, John Hancock (Will Smith) is despised by the people of Los Angeles. His spectacularly destructive efforts to fight crime usually end up costing the city millions. So when Hancock saves budding PR executive Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) from certain death at a level crossing, Embrey offers to repay Hancock by helping reinvent his image. Embrey's young son is thrilled to have a superhero hanging around, but Ray's wife, Mary (Charlize Theron), seems to be wrestling with both attraction and alarm... ""Hancock"" is outrageous, funny, smart, knowingly ridiculous and surprisingly moving. Yes, moving. I was expecting ""Bad Boys + super powers"", or at most a spoof on the clichés of the rapidly tiring superhero genre. What we get is something else entirely. The surprising tonal shift of the second half is neither as grating nor as abrupt as preview audiences had us believing. For me, it really worked. So much so that this is one of the few blockbusters I wish had been longer, giving writers Gilligan and Ngo and director Berg more time to explore the backstory and the resonant depths it potentially had. The problem isn't so much that the tone changes, but rather that more isn't made of it. I also wanted to spend more time with these thoroughly likable characters. As it stands, ""Hancock"" is still a winner. The script is sharp, the direction kinetic, the music and lens work appropriately manic, and the performances fine. Most surprising is Smith who manages to keep his shirt on and wring a lot more than laughs out of Hancock. While Smith can stoke a box-office inferno with his name alone, he shows once again that he's also a pretty good actor. He can certainly do vulnerable, even in superhero mode.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Major disappoint in Will Smith's latest film,"Hancock is unfortunately full of disappointment. The movie starts off with the potential to be as good as any of Will Smith's great titles (Ali, Independence Day, I am Legend, etc); but the ""twist"" suddenly deteriorates the movie and, at least in my mind, it joins the ranks of such a silly film as ""My Super Ex-Girlfriend"".This isn't your average superhero movie. There really isn't a defined villain or evil Will Smith has to fight besides his own attitude towards the world. Will Smith does a great job for the role, but the story is indeed disappointing. The movie looks like its going great until everything is turned around by a lackluster twist.Also, I'm not sure if this movie is aimed to be an action flick or a comedy. The beginning had lots of wisecracks and smart remarks from Will Smith and company, but by the end of the film the only laughing I was doing was at the poor story being told.Basically the first half of the movie is done to perfection; pure, genuine Will Smith blockbuster, but sadly its turned upside down by a silly twist (Oh, and don't even get me started on the CG)",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Superhero with the power to save a movie,"It's a nice break from most superhero movies that just try so hard to take the subject matter seriously and fail so hard at it.This movie does not take the superhero seriously, it takes the person behind the superhero seriously but nothing else. No one does a better job at bringing a lofty character like Hancock down to realistic measures like Will Smith.The plot is far fetched and the twists it throws at you are beyond unreal. There's no real action. It's just scene after scene of Will, Charlize and Bateman doing what they do. Perfect roles for each of them.It's a performance movie with a questionable plot but the theme is understood. A comedy about a superhero, not easily pulled off, but an all star cast manages it well enough. Beyond the top three characters, there isn't much. The supporting cast is terrible. The bad guys are ridiculous. You really kind of believe Will Smith is a superhero because nothing else in this movie's world even comes close to him.He's a normal guy who just happens to save the day, whether he means to or not, but his greatest power is saving this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Enjoyable enough but it's no Iron Man,"This film was entertaining enough, but an idea this rich should have been much better.Truly surprising twist.

Will Smith looks like he's having a great time playing an a**hole. Just don't call him one! (The quote about calling him a ""Jackass"" - that's not the word they use in the film.)If you try to be careful about making the most of your movie dollar, wait for the DVD and go see Iron Man again.In fact, when the DVD comes out, skip it and rent Iron Man again. Iron Man is satisfying in ways that Hancock can't come close to.But if you're determined to see it, go. You'll probably enjoy it.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Great start, Questionable second part","Before I start, I would like to divide the movie in to two parts. First part where we see Hancock character is developing and trying to get better, and the second part where things become very cliché and boring.The first part was very interesting and fun, often burst me in to laugh, which I think what they intended to do. I do believe that they could have put more fun stuff, and funny lines to this part, instead of focusing on a public relations professional, Ray Embrey's cult idea of making a better life for others, and his wife..Then sadly , the movie started to evolve and change in to something very weird and unnecessary. It seemed like the director didn't have enough preparation to do so too. I didn't see and good lines or anything interesting. All it really involved was bunch or special effects and more Charlize Theron. I gotta say I am not a fan of her at all. Her acting was too hysterical and her moves were often too much.Will Smith does a great job on this movie and gets in to character really well. As said before, this is not a cliché superhero movie, at least not in the beginning. I do believe that it could have been a lot better though. My vote for the first part is 4.5 outa 5 ,and 1.5 for the second part.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Hey, 'Hancock' is a great movie!","I don't know what some people expect of this movie but I think it was terrific! No matter what he does, Will Smith just doesn't disappoint and 'Hancock' is certainly no exception. Is it because there is a great story but it's not necessarily a non-stop action flick? This movie delivers on so many fun levels and I think it is really balanced well. It's not perfect but perfection is quite rare. Regardless, this movie is fun entertainment. Jason Bateman, Charlize Theron (dang, she looks so great) and the rest of the cast are just as wonderful as Mr. Smith.

A promising start and a spectacular collapse...,"Hancock opens with an interesting concept: that of the drunk superhero who does more harm than good... and after saving a struggling PR Rep's life (Jason Bateman), Hancock enters into a process to shake his habits and become a ""real hero"". Sadly, this transformation occurs within a matter of 15-20 minutes on screen, and in a brisk 2 weeks Hancock has become a ridiculously smooth sexy saviour. With another 40 minutes or so to go and nothing to do, the plot decides to cough up twist after twist in a desperate effort to keep things going... with enormous (and overly dramatic) secrets about Hancock's past suddenly pouring on-screen.

Worth watching movie full of fun and action!!,"I saw this movie once again last and here's what I have to comment. Hancock was a pretty exciting as well as interesting movie. I believe the best element of Hancock is that it's concerning a superhuman who is just exceptionally human. Hancock is mainly different in its ending half. It drops off the humor significantly and brings some enthralling superhero mythology. It also brought in some quite tense and violent scenes that actually made me question if they ought to be marketing this movie as a kid's friendly summer movie as they trailer. I really like the good special effects and it was an excellent around 100 minutes movie worth watching. I won't declare film was a totally awful because it had some pretty fine moment such as that jail scene and the dramatic change in Smith's character of Hancock, starting from a bad outlook, alcoholic superhero whom everyone hates to much better mannered superhero, whom everybody likes. It was a great fun seeing it.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
I almost felt 90s came back.,"This film starring Will Smith is somewhat a treat for a pair, who find themselves in a movie theater not knowing what movie to see. It's a superhero movie that doesn't treat you like a brainless faceless nobody. It has a classic story with an original touch, it has its twists and all. Better yet, it's very well balanced. The modern age of commercial cinema left it's imprint on the look of ""Hancock"" as well, with the action shot earthquake-shaky, with abundance of CGI, with mild to no character development, although most of it, if not all, works in film's favor. This movie had more soul than most of what I'd seen this year, X-files 2 & Rambo 4 included. But it becomes way too rare that a Hollywood movie can be as entertaining as, say, it'd been ten years ago. I'd say ""Hancock"" is close to a Hollywood's take on Talashi Miike's ""Zebra Man"". Good movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Dark Side of Heroism: A Review of Charismatic Performances and Lackluster Action,"Alright folks, buckle up because this one's a wild ride! Let's start with the obvious - the acting? Solid. Will Smith, Charlize Theron, and Jason Bateman all bring their A-game and make this movie a charmer.Now, let's talk about the real meat of the matter - the story. The first half? Gold. I was hooked, invested, and ready for some superhero action. But then... well, let's just say the second half took a bit of a nosedive. It's not bad, per se, but it definitely loses steam.And that's the real kicker with this flick - it's an action movie, but there's not enough action. I mean, I love a good drama, don't get me wrong, but c'mon! I was looking for some explosions, some heroics, and this movie just didn't deliver.Now, I know some of you might be thinking, ""But the jokes! The jokes are great!"" And yeah, they are. But maybe it's just me, but I'm a little spoiled from the humor in that other superhero universe, and this movie just didn't quite hit the same level.All in all, it's a fun and charming movie, but it just lacks that extra ""oomph.""

Will Smith,"There is only so much that can be said about actor Will Smith, but most of that would be good.

The the twist happens that many people have talked about. And while it wasn't the best twist of all time, it changed the momentum of the movie.Overall, I really did like the characters of the film.

Hancock,OK this movie wasn't excellent I agree. But trust me it wasn't BAD it was really good.

O and another thing you can not call the movie boring because there is all of the time a nonstop action going on. And well frankly people who love only action shooting and that kind of movies well yeah they might not appreciate this movie as much as I did. So get a ticket and go see that movie.

Hancock — A drunk anti-hero for laughs and action,"Hancock is the odd super hero flick. You'll get a number of good laughs, some drama, and plenty of action.Will Smith does an excellent job of playing the troubled brooding angry emotional anti-hero who doesn't give a f*ck. The superb Charlize Theron gives us an other great emotional experience. And Jason Bateman is probably at his funniest as the kind hearted, right minded, tries as hard as he can good Samaritan.The scenes are well built, with nice connection between each of them. The dialogs are uproariously funny. The intrigued is well maintained. The action is interesting and diversified. The drama and the emotions are compelling, heart-tugging. And the setup is imaginative.The real problem lies in the fact that the movie doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. The action and the special effects are clearly the biggest assets, but the scenario says it's a funny piece, up until the third act, where it changes to a dramatic story. It doesn't have a cohesive whole. It feels like an introduction without the followup story. Most super hero film introducing their main character will have more meat to offer. The worst scene is the one with the French speaking kid. Remove the accent and it works.Still, it's great entertainment, especially if you like super heroes, action, or any of the principal actors.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

'Hancock' - just for action movie fans,"The glut of super-hero summer movies coughed up by Hollywood continues with ""Hancock"". Comparisons with the likes of the already released ""Iron Man"" and ""The Incredible Hulk"" and the yet to be released ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Hellboy"" are unavoidable; though it is clear that ""Hancock"" falls short of all these movies.The movie is a wasted opportunity. Will Smith, the most dependable Hollywood actor right now, with his last nine movies topping the box office, plays an unlovable superhero who goes through a transformation.It is a very promising premise, but the writers Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan along with director Peter Berg seem to lose their bearings half way and allow the movie to take one of the most bizarre and wholly boring twists in any Hollywood movie this year.Not even the talented Oscar winning actress Charlize Theron and the dependable Jason Bateman can rescue or clarify this muddle of a movie.Smith is Hancock, the superhero with good intentions but bad PR skills and even poorer hygiene. He cannot resist helping anyone in need, but much to the annoyance of the residents of Los Angeles, he does more harm than good. His rescues end up costing the city millions of dollars in damages.One day Hancock rescues an altruistic but failed PR man Ray who offers to refine him and make him presentable as a superhero. This takes up the first 20 minutes or so of the movie and is actually pretty entertaining. The wheels start coming off when Hancock starts taking an interest in Ray's wife and the movie proceeds to explain this attraction.Since it is a blockbuster, the movie has the luxury of money and does a good job with the action sequences and special effects. But the true thrills in the movie are the scenes where Hancock is making efforts to be nicer and presentable.Smith, with his wholesome reputation, asks the audience to stretch their imagination in having to believe his crass attitude early in the movie. Fortunately, those scenes are few and brief and it is not long before he goes about smashing things.Smith cements his reputation as the most dependable action if not superstar in Hollywood right now. This movie will not have quite the shine as ""Independence Day"" or ""I, Robot"" and he displays much better acting skills in ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" and ""I am Legend"". He was able to surprise us with his acting range.""Hancock"" sadly doesn't even put up any acting challenge before him and that is another reason the movie is a wasted opportunity.""Hancock"" never forgets that it is a summer blockbuster action movie, and in many ways it delivers in the way action movie fans would expect.

I wish i could tolerate the film long enough to give a spoiler,"I had to ask for my money back and I have sat through really crappy films. One might say that I have aged and am no longer able to understand the new generation but I surely have not lost my yearn for adventure. I would rather have an action movie or a sensitive feely movie, but I don't want an action film with feely filming. I hated the fact that it was filmed in shaky, first person, war footage camera work. I don't see life that way unless I'm really drunk, and when I run it is only on occasion but when it comes to a movie, especially an action film, I want to see what's going on and that won't happen unless the camera moves more than three feet away from Will Smith's face. He's cute and all but not that good an actor to pull off an action film by just showing how drunk he is. Show me action. If in the first 30 mins. I haven't seen long shot action then shave Charlize Therone's eyebrows and have her kill a couple of guys. That is entertainment. That is emotion with suspense. Save your silly dollar and go see Iron man.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Superhero meets Reality,"So before I saw this movie I heard allot of mixed reviews on how it played out. The most common comment I got from people who have already seen it tell me that the first half of the movie is hilarious and it started to suck when the second half started. I was told the second half of the movie was too serious for the plot line and story. I'm sorry but I've heard way too much bitching from everyone that all the movies are the same and when are new ideas going to come out to see a movie like this and then let others complain. This is a different kind of movie yes, but isn't that what people are looking for, not the same old crap? It had a really good message to it too, which is something that movies lately have been lacking somewhat. Not to mention it has Will Smith in it, Big Willies the man and there's no touching that. Anyway if you haven't seen it, please do. It is well worth it.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Unorthodox superhero becomes somewhat orthodox and boring,"What starts off as a lot of fun, ends with being corny. Hancock is more of your unorthodox superhero. With mega strength at his disposal, he can do pretty much what he wants. Will Smith once again is great. He done many summer blockbusters before and his performance and the overall film keeps up the tradition of raking in a lot of cash. The film itself is entertaining. Towards the end , it hard not to become disinterested.With all the Marvel and graphic novels adaptations being shot for the big screen, it was a breath air to be treated to a light hearted superhero flick. The first half contains laughs and you're never quite sure what Hancock's is going to do next to upset the community.But, when we reach the scene when we discover there more than one person who are gifted with unbelievable strength, it becomes tiresome. The whole love story and the tale of Hancock's past seems lazy and tricks you to believing you've somehow inserted a second disk.If i ever watch Hancock again, i will do so but only the first half. I saw myself avoiding the screen in an attempt to block out the awful love story. Shame, if only they kept the drunken Hancock all the way through the film, more people would of appreciated it uniqueness and no doubt have a higher rating",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Modest but not Super!,"We have seen many fake Hancocks throughout our lifetime. That would come in the form of drunken, cocky male humanoids who think they have special superheroistic powers to conquer any other male or female humanoid that gets in their way. Those guys are really just a bunch of cocks. The ""Hancock"" protagonist in Director Peter Berg's feature in reality is also drunk and cocky, but in reality also possesses special powers to conquer any other male or female humanoid that gets in their way to harm the city of Los Angeles. However, the L.A. citizens do not partake in the appreciation process mostly because Hancock is a drunk and cocky (for lack of a better word or maybe it's the perfect word.) Cock! Blockbuster king Will Smith plays Hancock with no real superhero thespian powers but modest enough to give it a heroic effort. Jason Bateman plays Ray Embrey, the public relations guru who desperately helps Hancock in getting the citizens to dispel Hancock's cocky image by changing his superhero persona as more as a crime-fighter than a bottle-chaser. The luscious Charlize Theron portrays Ray's devoted wife Mary, who in turn Mary Mary quite contrary turns out to be a little scary. But I will leave it at that. Do not want to be a cocky spoiler! Berg's direction in the first half of ""Hancock"" is an entertaining crowd-pleaser by displaying Hancock's comedic rebellious ways, but Berg throws us a curve ball in the latter part of the film that struck out with many viewers & critics, present company included. I am slightly recommending a ""Hancock"" because it does bring plenty of comedic saviors in its first hour to satisfy your cinematic cravings. *** Average",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Lots of Potential, Not Fully Realized","Making a Will Smith character unlikable is not an easy task. Unfortunately, Peter Berg devotes a lot of time and effort up front trying to achieve that very thing, and succeeds in large measure in making you loathe the character Hancock and the film along with it. When things finally kick into gear about half way in, it's almost enough to make you forget the 20-to-30 minutes of squirming uncertainty at the beginning--but not quite. Smith and Charlize Theron are terrific together, and the plot line is surprisingly intriguing, once the film finally gets around to it. Then there's Jason Bateman, who while likable enough, seems to be playing just another version of befuddled Michael Bluth, and is overshadowed by his charismatic costars. With its two dynamic lead actors and half-realized idea, Hancock is a pleasant diversion. But you can't help but think it could have been so much more.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hancock is a different type of superhero film,"(Synopsis) John Hancock (Will Smith) is an unhappy and reluctant superhero who is living in his own world. For some unknown reason, Hancock is depressed and has started drinking very heavily. He has saved many lives in Los Angles over the years, but in doing so, he has no regard for damaging buildings, trains, roads, cars, or anything that gets in his way to get the job done. The last time he captured several criminals, it cost the city $9 million to fix the damages. The public has had enough of Hancock, and they want him to stop or go to another city. Then one day, Hancock saves the life of Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) from being run over by a train. Ray is a Public Relations executive who now can go home to his wife and child, because Hancock was there. Ray owes Hancock his life, and he makes it his mission to change his superhero's image and have the public cheering him. Ray's wife, Mary (Charlize Theron), believes Hancock can not be fixed, and she doesn't want Ray to be hurt.(My Comment) Hancock is a different type of superhero film. The movie is original in that our superhero is a washed up drunk who is also a jerk. Hancock, the Rodney Dangerfield of superheroes, gets no respect. We usually love and praise our superheroes for saving us from danger, but Hancock on the other hand is hated for being an a**hole. By the way, don't ever call Hancock an a**hole when he says, ""say that one more time,"" because there are consequences. How can you love a superhero when he is rude and inconsiderate of others? With a PR man, even this superhero can change. Once Hancock is repackaged, and the city comes calling, Hancock is on his way to becoming a superhero the public can love. The movie is comical at first, and then gets a little serious by the end. The a**hole scenes are hilarious and made me give out a really big laugh. There are some twists and turns in the plot that you won't see coming. Smith, Bateman, and Theron displayed good chemistry together. The movie is very entertaining with lots of action and unusual special effects. I enjoyed myself, and you will to, if you go and see it.

An interesting take on a superhero-movie comedy.,"My Take: A funny and satirical take on the superhero genre.Before it falls prey to the typical over-the-top effects-heavy summertime entertainment, HANCOCK is a surprisingly fresh take on the superhero genre, which also got a huge makeover at the time with films like IRON MAN and THE DARK KNIGHT. In a way, HANCOCK is a worthy dish to add to the buffet of surprisingly new age summertime comic book movies. Instead of the typical effects-laden movies of its kind (which, actually, is what this film becomes sometime in the second act), HANCOCK is a satire. Instead of your typical superhero origin story, which just get straight to the point: Hancock is an asshole of a superhero, and nobody likes him.For years now, Will Smith has starred in several promising blockbuster (usually coinciding with a 4th of July screening). But his character as HANCOCK is a long way from his roles in INDEPENDENCE DAY and MEN IN BLACK. Just as role in I AM LEGEND was a more serious take on his typical action hero, his John Hancock often calls for him to be totally unlikable. Yes, we have to take him as a total jerk, but then relate to him when the only reason for his actions is that the world isn't exactly a ray of sunshine for him. A public relations professional (Jason Bateman) seeks to change that, just as he seeks to change the world in his little ways. But his wife (Charlize Theron) isn't too comfortable when his husband hangs out with the chaos-prone alcoholic superhero.Although the last act boils down to another effects-heavy blockbuster with dizzying special effects (shot entirely in headache-inducing ""shakycam""), HANCOCK's real appeal is how funny it is. Smith is hilarious in the role, yet we gain sympathy from the character when he wants us to. Director Peter Berg knows how to balance summertime effects gigs and satirical comedy (even if the balance does tip a little in the final act), making HANCOCK a good time if far from an entirely perfect movie. To quote our hero, good job!Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Believe the reviews ... this is not a good movie,"I like Will Smith as an actor. I like sci-fi movies. I even like the cool trailer for this movie ... so I thought this film couldn't be too bad. Well, it actually was pretty bad. Among the most annoying things were: poor visual quality, unlikeable characters and a bad story.The ""idea"" behind this movie sounds great: a reckless and drunk superhero with unknown origin is inspired to turn himself around. In the process, he learns that he is not the only one of his kind in the world ... and the story progresses from there.This could have been a really original (and humorous) story. However, it falls apart very quickly. The first sign that something was wrong was the visual feel: much of the movie had kind of a dull lighting and contrast. It reminded me of movies of the 1970s. In fact, many of the outfits even had a dated look. It all felt very awkward.Another problem was that the characters are pretty annoying. It's a given that Will Smith's character should be unlikeable at the start - but the film fails to ever make him pleasant. The other main character, his ""good guy"" PR agent, comes across as both intellectually challenged and wimpy as a husband, so it's hard to feel anything for him. Lastly, Charlize Theron's character is no more respectable or likable than the other two.Perhaps the biggest problem with the movie is the story. It sounds good in principal, but when you see how it is fully imagined (executed), it's painful to watch. The story starts out OK but then it degenerates into a love-triangle quagmire with characters that are hard to root for. It's just not interesting.Will Smith is a very talented actor; he's generally interesting to watch no matter what movie he's in. However, with so many Will Smith fans writing scathing reviews, my advice is simple: trust them. This is a bad movie - enjoy the trailer but skip the movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fell Apart At The End,The movie is intersting as it deals with problems some superheros face but overall it is just mediocore movie.At the end the story went in a another direction and it just felt blend like the ending was not something we deserved. it would be better if they kept everything a mystery and released a second movie which will explain every mystery.,,Anonymous,Fantasy
Way much better than it is rated here!,"Maybe this movie is not that unique and different which makes its rating here not that high, but in my eyes, this film is really way much better which should let it get a higher rating. I am not going to talk about the technical part in the film since there is no need to talk about it before we can really tell no difference between the scenes using it and without it. About the performance, I would say both Will Smith and Charlize Theron did a good job. Will is always good at being both funny and serious in different scenes in one same movie, and he did it quite good again this time in ""Hancock"". Charlize was also good in the film, her performance was natural and really no strings attached. That really makes us able to see the power inside her performance. The movie actually is not really the one which is ""totally entertaining"". I said it is because this movie has a part which is a bit heavy. That actually a bit breaks the speed and the rhythm of the movie. But since it is needed for the direction the movie goes, I would not really mind about it. The movie is good, and you will see a funny Will Smith as always, so why not to go to enjoy it?",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Enjoyable...if not reckless like it's hero.,"In my eyes, Hancock is definitely what you would define as a ""blockbuster"". It is an original idea, it's action packed, funny, possesses a sound cast, it is infested with special effects and, generally, has that ""blockbuster"" feel about it.It is most definitely an entertaining film and there's no doubt in my mind that you will feel satisfied upon exiting the cinema however, it soon hits you that Hancock could have, and should have, been a better film.With a concept as original as Hancock, Peter Berg, does not necessarily fail, but is just unable to fully fulfil it's potential. As many a critic has pointed out, the first half of Hancock is great: the plot flows well, Hancock's character is developed very soundly and the spoofs are genuinely amusing. It is often pointed out though, that the second-half of Hancock is what lets it down. I for one, thought exactly the same when I had seen it but, after having a little ponder I decided that the problem was that Hancock was simply too short for it's own good. The events of the second-half are entertaining, don't get me wrong, it's just once the first-half has passed, it feels as though the rest of the film was mindlessly thrown together and it feels awfully rushed. Certain aspects of the story aren't fully explained, Jason Bateman's character is almost completely forgotten, the villain is weak (with no disrespect to Eddie Marsan who gives an effective performance despite this) and the ending, really, is just far too abrupt.But, like I mentioned before, Hancock is an enjoyable movie. Dialogue is snappy and the three lead characters are all developed very well. Will Smith puts in a sound performance as the lonely, public-scorning superhero Hancock and Charlize Theron is effective as the loving wife of Jason Bateman (who is also effective) giving a softly intimidating performance. Special effects are convincing and nicely portray the results of Hancock's recklessness. The action scenes are exciting enough that they make up for some of the film's low-points during the second-half.Hancock is definitely an enjoyable movie but it's lack of coherence during it's second-half and dodgy runtime of 92 minutes means it is unable to completely fulfil it's highly potential concept. Entertaining, nonetheless.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
OK Will the real Super Hero Smith Please Get a Great Script,"Will Smith is a very talented actor. One of these days he will get a great script and prove it to everybody. This is film better than I Am Legend, but it is not the one with a great script.Smith plays a rude & crude super hero who has no idea why he is a hero and does not like being called A-Hole. I watched the unrated DVD version of Hancock which is 10 minutes longer than the movie theater version of it. The extra minutes help the film as the theater version is chopped up too short.It is kind of neat to me having a hero named Hancock. Hancock is a common name used for towns in several states much less being an acronym for everyman as in John Hancock which is the full name of Smith's character. To me, the lack of a master/super villain helps this film because the film isn't long enough to develop that villain.The film title reminds me of a football coach I had. We were playing a team from the town of Hancock, and doing sprints in practice prior to the game. As we started the sprints he said, first you run 20 yards and yell Han, then you run 20 yards and yell c-ck. Then after realizing what he said, he decided we should not do the yelling, especially within ear shot of the horny female cheerleaders.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I'd consider My Super Ex-Girlfriend a masterpiece compared to Hancock.,"My Super Ex-Girlfriend was funny and entertaining, but not Oscar worthy, It didn't try to be something that it wasn't. But comparing it to Hancock, and My Super Ex-Girlfriend is considered a masterpiece. I mean Hancock tries to hard to be too much of everything, and it fails to hit the high note. I saw the trailer, I thought I was expecting a fun superhero comedy with some dramatic moments. Would have liked it better, if it was just about a flawed superhero, and it did start out that way at first. But has it went on it became a seriously unwatchable melodrama of trying to explain why Hancock is so special, and it didn't explain itself enough to the point where you don't even care anymore. Now I know it was not meant to be a superhero film, Like My Super Ex-Girlfriend wasn't meant to be. But it could have been better if it just stayed a simply comedy. Why are Will Smith, Charlize Theron, and Jason Bateman wasting there talent on junk like this, I seriously don't think they need the money, or there desperate. Now the special effects are the only good in this movie. To some parents out there, who's kids love Will Smith, this is not a movie for kids. Take them home and watch Men In Black 1 and 2 instead.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A thinly veiled Obama campaign ad,"I boycotted this movie when it first came out, despite the fact that I like Super Hero movies. I have always had this funny feeling about the movie, thinking it looked weak and stupid, and I had this suspicious feeling about it, too. So recently I finally decided to rent it and to my surprise, my suspicions were all confirmed. This movie was nothing but a thinly veiled Barak Obama campaign advertisement.It is about ""Hancock,"" named after one of our founding fathers John Hancock. A MAGIC black man (super hero) who will ""Change everything."" The idea of Change comes up over and over again in the movie....if only ""people can learn to accept him and to like him. The whole world will change!"" Hancock's friend in the movie is the character Ray, who is an image consultant. His day job before he meets Hancock is going around to EVIL CORPORATIONS run by WHITE MEN and trying to convince them to DO WHAT THEY DO, PRODUCE WHAT THEY PRODUCE, BUT GIVE IT ALL AWAY TO THE WORLD FOR FREE. Just like Obama's communist political agenda! I am not exaggerating, that is EXACTLY what he tells the corporations in multiple scenes. Also, get a load of this: the license plate of Ray's car is shown in one scene of the movie...it reads ""GREEN 44."" Any significance? How about the GREEN MOVEMENT and the 44th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES? Let me tell you, I know movies, and in just about EVERY movie scene where a license plate can be seen, it has some kind of hidden meaning or code put in there by the director. That is one of the oldest and little known tricks in the book of movie making.Also, this movie was released on July 2, 2008 here in the U.S. Just in time to start brainwashing people and warming up their minds for the November Election. Don't forget that stupid staged photo of Obama posing in front of that Superman Statue. That picture was circulated heavily during his campaign, and it was not long after this movie came out. Seems obvious to me they were trying to tie it all together.I guess the people who vote here in the USA really are incredibly stupid. This movie sucked. It had no central villain, and the one armed bad guy they tried to put up against Hancock was weak and under developed. Overall, I rate this movie VERY low. It was a pathetic campaign ad, that's all.

A lot of interesting concepts and unanswered questions,"When its a Will Smith movie on the queue I kinda hold my breath. Will is capable of just about anything and everything. He can do art house films and multi-plex packing movies. This one almost seemed to be trying to be both at once. I'll avoid talking about the big high concept idea of Will and Charlize's characters because it opens the door to too many questions. The film wants all our focus on this degenerate superhero, or, more the point how do we common people relate to someone who has extraordinary gifts. Do we kowtow to them? Do we excuse their inexcusable behavior? Is anyone so essential to keeping the peace and order that they are given allowances for shortcomings and deeds that the rest of us would be imprisoned for(i.e. Jack Bauer, Vic Mackey, Dick Cheney). The script isn't going anywhere near answering those questions in a real, cogent way.On a side note, some folks believe this is a racist film. I don't agree with that perspective. I believe if this script were around thirty years ago this would've likely been a Richard Pryor vehicle.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Good Movie, But. . .","""Hancock"" elevates itself above the usual summer fare right off the bat with an unusual plot. Imagine a man with superpowers who then decides to become a superhero, but his rotten attitude and penchant for causing more damage to his city than good has the citizens of Los Angeles begging him to go somewhere else. It's an interesting twist on the superhero story. Will Smith plays the titular man as a surly, heavy-drinking, foul-mouthed, unpleasant citizen of L.A. As usual, he is very good, probably the thing I enjoyed most about the movie. He adds several requisite layers to Hancock but manages to make them feel fresh. Coming in a close second to what I enjoyed most was Jason Bateman as a PR exec who wants to make over Hancock's image. Bateman's comedic timing and earnestness compliment's Smith wonderfully. The effects are good and there are several moments that are quite funny. However, the film does have its flaws. The first gripe for me would be that the director, Peter Berg, seems to be an avid fan of the extreme close-up. When two people are talking he often zooms so close in on their faces that you cannot even see their hairline. I found it distracting. I also thought that Charlize Theron was miscast. I like her a lot and I think she's a great actress, but she lacked the comedic timing needed for her part as Jason Bateman's wife who is very skeptical that Hancock can change. She plays one scene in particular, a kitchen confrontation with Hancock, very straight and dour which is a jarring contrast to Smith's light comedy. Next, the story. The premise is unusual and quite good, but it looses steam less than halfway through the movie. The movie is quite short, only an hour and a half, so at least in that respect there isn't much left once the plot starts giving out. It takes an unbelievable turn in the third act that I just didn't buy. I think the screenwriters found it difficult to stretch a simplistic idea to a feature length. Also, the lack of a central villain hurt as well. Pitting Hancock repeatedly against petty criminals just did not work as well as if they had given him a main nemesis.""Hancock"" is good and quite entertaining, there are several reasons to see it. Is it a perfect movie? No, but it has enough redeeming qualities to make it the perfect summer escape.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Superhero sleeping on a bench... sounds painfully familiar!,"The initial premise was very captivating and I felt that they could have done a lot more with it. A lot of the humor was rather generic and could have used some help. But what I found most disappointing was the way in which movie devolved into some kind of attempt at epic and biblical themes of angles, love, and our purpose in life; more than anything because unfortunately, this, too, was very generic in it's scripting and execution. I would have much rather preferred that the movie continue to play to our fascination and inspiration towards superheros, while playing off the interesting contrast that the misfit and antisocial behavior of the protagonist offered. Even movies with the generic angel / biblical mold such as Constantine and that Christopher Walken movie have been more exciting, with superhuman characters clashing for supremacy.The public relations bit was cool; the love triangle was not.http://nickysworld.net",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

My vote is for Will Smith.Valid criticisms:
-love story would have been more appropriate for multiple movies or for a tv series otherwise it should be removed
-better development of villain should be considered

A new race,"It's not so difficult to realize, on a first glance, the intentions ""Hancock"" has as a motion picture. It has Will Smith in the lead role and as a producer; it's an action picture with a lot of adrenaline and visual effects; it's, and this is never a little fact, a superhero movie. This said, it's also easy, with one look, to notice that the film presents a turn on the typical superhero plot development. We've got to be fair: the script by Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan is original and character driven, but ""Hancock"" is not the first recent film that tries to bring something different to the superhero table; animation plays with the concept of superheroes all the time, and this will continue to happen. However, when it comes to live action and in an era of mature ""Spider/Iron/Super/Bat Man"", ""Hulk"" tales (which never lack sense of humor), John Hancock represents a new race. Precisely because he didn't came from a comic book and because his story doesn't necessarily emulates the steps of the other stories, this is also a race of superhero film we won't see very often.Always comic but never a parody, ""Hancock"" presents us a man with powers, who fights crime and saves lives but has recently lost his popularity. We look at him and we sense something profound in his eyes. He's not a millionaire, or a doctor, or a lawyer He's just a man, an immortal human being with a lot of strength who drinks all the time and isn't able to do his job right. But is this his job? We don't know anything about Hancock, but Smith never plays him with a pose: too smart, too cocky, too serious, or too drunk for that matter. There's a short sequence, with beautiful music by John Powell, in which we see Hancock by himself. He's not comfortable with who he is, and it's never the film intention to mock him, even when everyone keeps calling him an 'asshole'.Therefore, on a second glance, it's once again easy to perceive that story and characters mean more to Peter Berg than the bad guys Hancock has to fight (or what I call 'events'). There are a few action sequences, but they are not necessarily impressive. It seems to me it's always more about what Hancock will do, for him, in each case, than the shock the audience will receive, visually and in terms of sound. At the same time, there's a more detailed construction in the conversational scenes. Missing elements and unsaid things in the dialog combined with strong looks on one hand; unexplained warnings on the other. Of course, this is not entirely serious or dramatic, but it's obvious and transparent. Always comic, the movie has silly musical montages and there are comic touches in a lot of situations but the actors are –when it comes to drama- well directed, focused (specially Jason Bateman); and if I don't tell you anything else is because there's a story worth watching and the way things unfold is natural and not at all definitive. Also, even though it's a short ride, when it's over it's not like there was a big case closed, a mystery solved or a lot of people saved in an event. There's just life, with its (sad) comings and goings, and we want to know more about the people whose lives we've witnessed for a while.Everything in the film is, nevertheless, completely entertaining, given the fact that Will Smith is a winning actor who understands what the audience wants, in any genre he's doing; and because Charlize Theron is beautiful and we can't take our eyes off of her. I saw in ""Hancock"" other things, specific elements I chose not to mention that made this for me a different, enriching experience. The elements are there. You can think of them as part of an uninteresting whole or you can give them more credit. Anyway, is as The Dire says: when there's a good story",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Call Me That One More Time,"Greetings again from the darkness. No question that Will Smith is a movie star and can pull off a super hero ... even an apathetic, alcoholic, amnesiac-stricken super hero. Here he is very physical while at the same time using facial expressions to try and get in touch with his more human side.This mess goes wrong pretty quickly. The special effects are overboard and director Peter Berg (""Very Bad Things"", ""The Kingdom"") way over directs ... especially with the 360 degree facial close-ups. All the eye gazing between Will Smith and Charlize Theron take away any mystery in what the big plot twist might be. Even the score is weak. Is it too much to ask for a decent theme song for a super hero? This one sounds like it is straight out of a John Ford movie, or maybe ""Wagon Train"".Jason Bateman has almost as much time as Will Smith but really isn't able to bring much to a nothing role. Smith is the only one who shows any depth as his is the only character with more than one dimension. The cartoonish special effects just don't work and the great little idea of the rehabbing super hero just falls flat.

The other side of super hero,"I was amazed by the reviews in meta critic and low score. Not that I don't rely on these score to choose what movie to watch and what to skip but Hancock is a real exception.The movie rather than showing the all powerful side of the superheroes and the wonder of being immortal; the movie the showcased how lonely can a superhero be, if he is living an immortal life. The romance between the immortal pair who becomes mortal and victim of attacks was so beautifully shown that I watched the movie more than a dozen time.Will smith is so much believable as the lonely superhero. Neither the super powers of Hancock nor the action scenes makes these movie a wonder for me but it is the vulnerability and the undying love.I will simply recommend you to watch the movie without the superhero angle, it is only an added plus.Believe me giving a 9 to this movie is totally justified.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hancock ... a good movie if you can stop comparing it to every other superhero flick!,Hancock is a good movie for teens and adults as younger viewers may not be able to take in the whole scope of the movie or appreciate some of the more adult humor.The version I watched is unrated but I'd give it a PG-13.There are periods of profanity and violence so if you are squeamish about watching or are squeamish about your children watching then I would not recommend this movie for you.Other reviewers may have stated that Hancock was no Superman or Batman and that is true in the same way that Alien is no Jaws or vice versa even though they are both monster-type movies. I don't think Hancock was trying to be Superman ... it is what it is and it should be taken as such.If you watch Hancock and DON'T compare it to another superhero flick or pick apart every little camera angle I think you will enjoy it as it is funny and the ending is touching! Just try it! Don't listen to everyone else says and miss out on a movie that you may REALLY like! If you don't want to spend the money buying it just yet then rent it or borrow it from a friend but at least give it a spin!,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Someone needs to be fired,"How can anyone like Will Smith let themselves become involved with an absolute piece of worthless trash like this? I had the misfortune to get in on a pre-release screening of Hancock last week in LA and can only say this: Someone needs to be fired and someone needs to get this back to editing to do a rewrite. The screenwriters almost graduated high school -I think; and the director probably needs to get back to rehab. You can see it for yourself and draw your own opinions - but taking into account all that Smith has done in the past, I cant help but worry about his film-making future. I know they can rework scenes, sets, even complete endings...but can they do a rework on the film from right after the opening credits to the end? Someone needs to be fired.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
predominantly serves as a showcase for Smith who has little to work with,"An unusual idea for a genre film: an antihero who's posing as a superhero, showing complete disdain for the very people he's trying to protect. Hancock is the only one of his kind, a pie-eyed, antisocial, foulmouthed ""man of steel"" who ends up causing more damage than the LA criminals he's trying to apprehend, that is until he meets and befriends Ray Embrey (Bateman), a sunny public relations executive who makes it his mission to mold Hancock into a bona fide hero. Opens with snap, energy, and the kind of silly humor you'd expect, and Smith manages to be engaging even while portraying an unlikable character, but eventually it becomes tedious and redundant as the slim story ingredients get pushed beyond their limits. **",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"It's a bird! It's a plane! Nope, it's a hungover Fresh Prince!","The summer of 2008 wasn't exactly superhero-free: we had The Dark Knight, The Incredible Hulk and, on a lighter side, Iron Man. Even lighter was Hancock, the least accomplished, but certainly most entertaining blockbuster that came by in that period.Basic idea: Hancock (Will Smith) is a flawed vigilante. So far, nothing new: the whole philosophy of Marvel Comics' production has always been ""superheroes with super-problems"", and Superman and Batman ain't that perfect either, especially on film. The twist? Hancock's case is rather extreme - he has a drinking problem, which causes him to cause more damage than good. Okay, so Tony Stark also has a soft spot for the odd cocktail or two (hopefully, that aspect will be analyzed in Iron Man 2, as promised by Jon Favreau), but even he wouldn't greet a bunch of criminals he's about to arrest like this: ""Your head is going up his ass, his head is going up his ass, and you get the short end of the straw, 'cause your head is going up my ass!"". Is it really that surprising that Joe Public's nickname for the guy is ""a**hole""? Didn't think so.Lucky then for Hancock that Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), a PR guy, is interested in cleaning up his reputation, much to the dismay of Mrs. Embrey (Charlize Theron). This consists of sending the dude to prison for some time, so that he can sober up and understand what is expected from him. Once he gets out, he can become the real protector America needs, which is a good thing considering trouble is waiting around the corner...This isn't the first time director Peter Berg has handled action and comedy at the same time: he previously helmed Welcome to the Jungle, starring The Rock and, uh, Seann William Scott (plus Christopher Walken), and landed an acting gig (along with Bateman, coincidentally) in the misdelivered Smokin' Aces (where the humor was the wrong kind of black). In this case, he benefits from a witty script co-written by Vince Gilligan, whose knack for weird comedy is well known to anyone who's seen The X-Files (among other things, he wrote an episode where David Duchovny switched bodies with, wait for it, Michael McKean). The ""hero gone bad"" premise is managed deftly, and as long as the focus stays on Hancock's troubled nature the film remains right on track. Too bad the screenplay calls for an uninvited twist halfway through the story which leads to a sudden shift in tone that can't be shaken off, no matter how hard Berg tries. It's as if two different scripts had been glued together and separated by the 45-minute mark.However, the result isn't as sloppy as one could expect, courtesy of one of Berg's major qualities - his ability as an actors' director (quite easy, since he's an actor himself). Even Bateman and Theron, who are supposedly stuck in boring supporting roles, give truly charming and funny performances (now, who said Theron can't do comedy?). As for Smith, his drunken wise-ass act is arguably his most purely entertaining effort since Men in Black (the first one, obviously), and surely the only reason a sequel has been announced. Not that it's necessarily a bad idea: just get him off the wagon again and we'll eagerly await his return.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"I love you Will Smith, but you ain't the right man for this movie.",This movie is unique in almost every aspect and i really enjoyed it but i can't help but disliking the end of this movie. It was total waste of a good opportunity for an A-class movie.,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It challenges,"I was thinking what would be a good way to start my review. This movie surely evokes extreme controversial feelings. Why? Because, all the movie-making aspects (directing, script etc) were leading to that. Why? It could have been on purpose  which I hope it was. But it could have also been because of poor execution of the idea. I am leaving the cast out of the controversies though. They were simply great. Now, I like to think it delivers controversial feelings on purpose. Isn't it motivating to you guys when a movie does not give explanations on the plate? When it does make you wonder let's say what could have happened millenniums ago? Isn't it challenging to see that our expectations could be wrong about a movie: that it was not about a superhero saving people's lives, but instead about how he was affected by this way of being? If we do not recognize that such controversies come from our difficulty to grasp different (or deep) ways of thinking, than we will surely blame on the movie. Yes, it could have been longer, but it was in line with the purpose of leaving things unrevealed. I personally love that: to have the space to imagine and visualize what could be beyond. Maybe you should dare to do that and not expect the movie to do it for you. And if you are not willing, fine. Just, find another movie that satisfies that need of yours. There are plenty of them. This one is for people who like the duality and completion from opposites: humor-gravity, good-evil, surface-depth, male-female, and so on. I would love to see a sequel. But it would be fine without that too. Thanks.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A good superhero movie even with the final straight hinder an overall assessment of adventure. Lacked major conflicts, intimidating a villain, and a more coherent script","Hancock is directed by Peter Berg, the professional behind the regular The Rundown (2003) and Friday Night Lights (2004) and The Kingdom (2007). And brings something different to tell a story about a superhero unconventional. Adaptations of superheroes are increasingly common from 2000, where several beloved characters of the comic also invaded the cinema. But Hancock is a different hero. He is not coming from the comics, with an original idea, as well as the world and environment in which it is inserted. Far from cities that exist only in comics or specific worlds. Hancock lives in Los Angeles these days and their personality characteristics or behavior are not friendly to children or adults, and almost an anti-hero.John Hancock (Will Smith) is a superhero who is always drunk, bitter, sad, alone and misunderstood that it had lost popularity due to its unconventional rescue attempts that end up destroying the city. He does not hesitate to destroy bridges and buildings to prevent theft or derail a whole train to save a single person. In current times, Hancock is a superhero that does not interest anybody, because the cost / benefit ratio is not appropriate and the population begins to demand that he be punished for the damage to public property. After saving Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), one public relations agent trying to sell your own seal of quality for large companies, provided that they commit to donate their own products to people in need, he offers to help you improve your image. The idea is not well accepted by Mary (Charlize Theron), the wife of Ray, who shows her husband that Hancock had an arrest warrant against him thrown. Ray then suggests that Hancock was delivered to the police, even though they could escape from prison at the time he wanted to set an example to people and initiate change his public image. Ray believes that with Hancock arrested, crime will trigger and, therefore, the population will call back their hero. Ray will then try to make him a superhero ""within standards."" Hancock also have to deal with romantic tension that arises between him and Mary. At first she did not like the hero and makes that clear, but it is the key to Hancock better understand its past.The film features familiar names in its production, as Akiva Goldsman, Jonathan Mostow, Michael Mann and Will Smith himself, is a very valid attempt to create a new superhero unconventional, bringing your personality weaknesses, conflicts and behaviors as well humans, who are in search of redemption. The writers Vy Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan bring a good mix of various genres. We share very well supported by great special effects, a dose of drama, adventure and comedy that essentially is the fundamental basis of the plot. Until a few remnants of romance can be perceived.Will Smith is the great hallmark of his films. The actor is beautiful, has physical strength, is versatile, and every year gets better and better as an actor and is, above all, extremely charismatic. In any project he decides to venture is certain that millions of people will be taken to the cinema halls. His last film surpassed the $ 100 million easily. Therefore, a film actor, depending on the genre, is guaranteed to thrill and in this case, to have fun and entertain.We soon realized how this new hero. During a police chase, Hancock sleeps on a street bank with bottles of drink in hand, when he is awakened by a child who shows him in a store the chase broadcast live on television. Not very happy, he grabs a bottle of drink, stir in the skirt of a woman and goes flying clumsy and wobbly. Later on it will destroy some public assets and already we can see the population revolted by massive destruction.Hancocké a kind of critical and at the same time a parody of superhero comics and movies, which are always seen as perfect, flawless behavior that is totally donate to save others and who are worshiped in their own universes. John Hancock is now the opposite of all this. No wonder that Hancock is not admired because of their behavior, attitudes and bad examples totally egocentric, you do not care about the opinions of others. For these reasons, the beginning is even hard to create some empathy with the character, but the lighter tone and comedy as well as we know the best, it becomes enjoyable. The scenes where he performs with a uniform and try to be more sociable are hilarious. It's as if the character Ray was teaching a child to behave in front of others.Earlier, before Ray convince him to change to be accepted, we have very funny scenes, like the persecution of robbers logo in the opening scene, the rescue train track and ""rescue"" the beached whale seen through a video posted on the Internet. The scenes of him in jail also take good laugh. Even after already out of jail, the scenes remain. The sequence of the assault was one of the best as well as the short dialogue with the police: ""You let me touch it?"". In some jokes, however, the text searching and force some situations where it should not start laughing, as in the choice of uniform hero.Importantly, for these and other action scenes, director Peter Berg had a great budget of $ 150 million that allowed him to extrapolate and use all the creativity. We see a shot of whale and a boy, thrust striking inside the jail, intercepting a train at high speed, landing with feet on the asphalt of the street, not to mention the scenes of flight performed linearly and very natural. The special effects are the highlight of the film, which are used mostly in the final climax. The footage of Berg performed in much close mostly and with the camera shaking, sometimes even appearing in a more documentary gives a greater sense of immersion and realism in action in the midst of action.The script is lost already in the final, which inserts a twist not too happy, with a plot involving aliens who may not live near one another. Peter Berg, trying to explore relationships between Hancock, just as the mood abruptly and focuses on drama, to bring some answers from the past of the protagonist. This is where the text becomes without much meaning without emotion and even confusing. The only good thing is that Charlize Theron, who spends much of the film without function begins to have importance in the outcome of long.Another fact is that when the director always focuses on the face of Charlize Theron, pointing to the obvious fact that it hides some mystery, even though we do not know exactly what the mystery. What you may have missed the most is the presence of a villain to match. Even if the intention is to show the personality of Hancock and its acceptance in society, lacked any threat more interesting in the end. The villain Red (Eddie Marsan) does not transmit threat at any time and is another element that makes the end does not work as it should.As already mentioned, Charlize Theron is once again incredibly beautiful and during the long ends up having an important role in the resolution of the plot. More serious roles and dense, the actress decided to venture into a genre lighter and fun. Knowing the power of the actress, she does very well, even though there is great depth in the script. Jason Bateman is also the will as Ray and form a nice duo with Will Smith. The contrast between optimism and negativism an optimal yield of the other scenes between the two. The chemistry between Will and Charlize is also worthy of mention.The soundtrack by John Powell (X-Men 3 - The Last Stand (2006), PS I Love You (2007)), is effective and has perfect sync with editing agile Colby Parker Jr. And Paul Rubell. Photograph of Tobias Schliessler well detached Los Angeles and also in darker scenes, and art direction by William Hawkins and Dawn Swiderski also composes well more modern language adopted by the director.In a decade with the premiere of several films of superheroes, the presence of anti-hero Hancock looked promising, especially with Will Smith as his interpreter, but even being a good movie even with the final straight hinder an overall assessment of adventure. Lacked major conflicts, intimidating a villain, and a more coherent script. Anyway, it is an excellent entertainment fast, disposable, but innovates in the synopsis and no doubt is very interesting.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
All in all... Entertaining,"You know how Gotham City loves Batman, and how everyone in New York City is a fan of Spiderman? Have you ever wondered what a superhero would do if everyone hated him and everything he does goes unappreciated? You're not alone, and Hancock is here to answer our question. Hancock is a movie about an alcoholic superhero, John Hancock, played by Will Smith (I Am Legend), who everyone hates because he does more damage than good. He then saves the life of a Public Relations representative; Ray, played by Jason Bateman (Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium), after which Ray decides to help Hancock change the society's image of him. Ray's wife, Mary, is played by no other than the always beautiful Charlize Theron (Monster). Truth is; the less you know about this movie before going in to watch, the better. So is the movie any good you ask? Hancock is directed by Peter Berg, remember him? He is the genius that brought you last year's The Kingdom (also starring Jason Bateman). The guy is a really good director. The movie is very well directed and there are some really amazing shots in there. It is written by Vince Gilligan (Creator of TV series Breaking Bad and Co-producer of TV series The X-Files) from an original story by Vincent Ngo. Not trying to sound like I know more than I actually do, but this is where the little flaw of the movie is. Let me explain. I've read Vincent Ngo's original script, ""Tonight, He Comes"", and it is amazing. When it was rewritten into Hancock, Vince Gillian changed it a little, and personally, I think it did more harm than good (ironically, so does Hancock). Also, I think this movie is marketed very wrongly. It is being marketed as a comedy Superhero Movie. If you go in with that mindset, you sure are going to be disappointed; because for a superhero movie, the action sequences weren't that many. So if you want to really enjoy Hancock, I suggest you go in with the mindset of watching a Comedy - Drama in which the main character just happens to be a superhero. Do you really want me to talk about the acting in this? I mean, the fresh prince himself is the main character. We all know Will Smith can win an Oscar by just making a cameo. Well, maybe not; but he is very good. Charlize Theron is probably not going to win an Oscar for this like she did for ""Monster"", but that is not to say she's not amazing. And Jason Bateman: Funny as always. Even the extras in this movie weren't bad! If you were to divide Hancock into three parts, I'd give: the first part 4.5 out of 5 stars, second part 4.5 out of 5 stars and 3 stars for the third. This is because the third act is lazy and felt really out of place. Too many unimportant things happened and there wasn't enough development or attention to the important ones. That being said, the movie still lets you go with a smile on your face; just make sure you stay after the credits. So what's up with that Eagle? Don't know the Eagle I'm talking about? Go watch Hancock... you know you want to.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Stay away, far away!","My god, this film was awful. I remember seeing the trailer for this film and thought it would be awesome but it really is a lot down. The film shifts halfway through into something totally bizarre and seems to lose it's identity throughout the film. What on earth were the filmmakers thinking of when they put this dross together.Will SMith in my opinion has made to serious errors of judgement, first with I am Legend and now this, is he just now cashing in and taking the money instead of looking for quality films to star in. Very disappointed indeed.Everything about the film was just wrong, acting was poor, the story was garbage and somehow they got themselves confused with the genre of the film. The first half of the film was entertaining and I think had they stuck along these lines for the rest of the film then they may have had a winner, it would never have been the best film of 2008 but people would have at least given it credit for what it is, a half decent comedy superhero movie not some bizarre film trying to use some sort of ancient mythology that just did not work.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not your garden variety super hero.,"Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman): People don't like you, Hancock. Hancock (Will Smith): Do I look like I care what people think?""Put your John Hancock on this."" How many times has someone used the signature figure of speech this way? Peter Berg's Hancock is also the real deal, a signature comic sci fi, super hero summer blockbuster unlike any other except Iron Man. Even Iron Man doesn't go far enough exploring the downside of heroism with the weaknesses of being human interfering with an ordered heroic world.Will Smith as Hancock turns in a much more nuanced performance than his I am Legend loner because here he must turn around a public that sees Hancock as an ""asshole"" hero who saves people but destroys property and endangers civilians as a result of his drinking and a bruised amnesiac brain that can't remember his early life. As Hancock he must confront human beings today, not barren post apocalypse as in Legend. He rehabilitates his public profile, sobers up, and contends with his attraction to his ""publicist"" Raymond's (Jason Bateman) wife, Mary (Charlize Theron).In other words, Hancock is not your garden variety super hero although he can fly and destroy with the best of them. He is conflicted about his weaknesses, his feelings toward Mary, and his forgotten past as a hero who may span thousands of human history years.In addition, the allegorical implications about The USA as flawed heroic nation imposing its will on small countries such as Vietnam and Iraq seems to lie underneath this commentary on pop-cult heroism. Even if you don't buy that aesthetic, consider the Star Trek theme of the gods envying humans even with all their emotional messes.Hancock weakens when it plays for laughs the heavy-duty existential attitudes of personal responsibility and at the same time looks for philosophical ballast. Star Trek did a better job of contrasting the lonely perfection of the gods' world with the robust, loving, but terminal world of humans. Hancock does a credible job showing how immortality without love is bound to lose to the glorious imperfection of mortality.""Oh, He hath made things worthier than Himself,And envieth that, so helped, such things do moreThan He who made them!""

Gotta love trailers!,"Well, today were going to talk about trailers, I admit that I see more trailers then the average person but how could anyone miss seeing at least a few Hancock trailers seeing as they've been playing them forever and so very often. I think I have seen three different trailers and from those trailers I could have told anyone the whole plot and most of the plot points before the film even started. Even what I am sure most viewers saw as a surprise I could have told you was going to happen just by watching one trailer. I won't give away anything here of course but that anyone who has seen the trailers would be surprised by anything in this movie surprises me. Either I see to many movies or your average movie goers are rather stupid, I'd say a little of both. Also the first half of the movie was almost all in the trailer, nothing fresh or new that I hadn't seen before for at least the first 40 minutes. My point is that making trailers is a lost art, only a very few trailers a year are well made and don't give away the whole film. OK, now back to the movie, the idea for this film is great but this movie doesn't take advantage of that, and there are few things I hate more then bad trailers and wasted ideas. All that said I loved the music and a few scenes were great and could have been amazing if the story around it would have been better. I admit there was maybe three or four funny lines that I hadn't heard before going in, but in a Will Smith comedy only three or four kind of sucks.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This movie is actually not THAT bad.,"Hancock - A very entertaining and fresh look at the superhero genre.I went into this movie having seen a picture of it on the NYTimes.com, and my only other knowledge being that Will Smith is in it and it has SOMETHING to do with superheroes. Having seen it with no expectation I have to say it was a great summer movie. Jason Bateman is very funny as per usual, and I truly enjoyed Will Smith in his role as the foul, dirty, whiskey chugging, superhero. I thought the role was surprisingly dark for Mr. Smith and I generally enjoyed the concept of an apathetic superhero. The action sequences were good enough, but most of all I was pleased not to be watching a Marvel Brand movie, which I for one and COMPLETELY sick of seeing over and over and over and over. This movie offered a lighter mood to heroes and allowed us to laugh at them, which is something I would definitely like to see more of.I think too many people are giving this movie a hard time, when it really is a solid summer movie.

It was funny and had lots of laughs but you can tell if it was rated R it would have been even more funny. It still came very close as a lot of profanity was used. There wasn't a HUGE plot but still 2 nice twist, i recommend it but not over other films. I think what will appeal to most is Will Smith. He really does try to put his best foot forward in this and he honestly does a good job. The pacing could have used some work though but all and all its good. I usually would say to wait for the DVD but some scenes should be viewed on the big screen. overall its enjoyable and maybe a good date movie more then anything else.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"An enjoyable, fast-paced, 'popcorn-loving' movie","The movie cost 150 million dollars to make and is only 92 minutes long. Uhm? Either the movie is that good or is another poor investment by Hollywood producers. For what I saw on opening day, it was well worth the admission ticket price. Will Smith as he always is makes a funny, likable, heroic, and believable character Hancock. Ninety minutes of Will Smith can usually make a great movie, but he has some assistance with Oscar-winner Charlize Theron and Jason Bateman. Both thespians help make this an enjoyable movie that adds a little bit of character development and likeness to their characters.As with the rest of the movie, it went into the amazing CGI. Like ""Transformers"" and ""War of the Worlds"", visual effects have proved to be awe-inspiring and captivating. As unrealistic as the plot and superheroes are, CGI makes it real.""Hancock"" is an enjoyable popcorn loving, fast-paced action flick. But there are some things that I did not like in this movie, particularly the prison scenes. I found the prisoners and other criminals throughout the film to be disturbing. Even more so the scene where Hancock stick one inmate's head up another's anus unneeded. It's funny, but it's also something I don't need to see after I had eaten. I liked the movie, but it could have done without some inappropriate scenes as well as some of the violent nature of criminals.

Everything Okay EXCEPT Charlize Theron Role,"Short and sweet.Movie starts off pretty funny, when you'll finding yourself laughing a lot by the unique humor and original jokes. The plot is descent if you're going in open minded and not expecting a comic book style adventure where some ultimate bad guy has some super doom in mind for all humanity until said super hero defeats before said villain or nefarious event.However, yopu'll immediately discover a sour taste in your mouth whenever a scene involving Charlize Theron comes into play. Her acting is so extremely artificial it almost is like watching a 3rd grade play. Aeon Flux was a perfect demonstration of this, but worked out better because well the character she was playing as was in general monotone anyways. However that sever acting flaw shines brightly in a movie thats more domestic than 'cold killer'. This gets even more highlighted when her role becomes more involved later in the movie.Over all I was generally pleased by the movie until the deeper plot comes out which kinda makes it feel like the writers were runnign shallow on the idea and just making it up as they went along.Over all its a good watch, can be easily waited for to be released to home theater but due to its action scenes and descent screen play by most of the people involved (minus Charlize Theron) you should be able to walk away with a new experience on your hands.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Flawed Hero? Try unlikable walking-disaster.,"I'd like to think that Hollywood's greed is tempered with genuine talent a fair deal of the time, as well as some messages that people were passionate about enough to present to us cinematically.And then there are movies like Hancock, wherein there is no message worth telling, and all the talent involved is beaten into submission by an oppressively useless script and the greedy leeches who produced it.Hancock is about a guy with superpowers (Will Smith) who essentially walks around looking like he's got a mouthful of rat poison and sour patch kids, being so inept at helping people that it feels like a Jerry Lewis movie if Jerry Lewis had superpowers and was utterly unlikable and unsympathetic. Jason Bateman plays Jason Bateman, a man who becomes Hancock's agent of sorts after Hancock manages to save his life in the most destructive way possible (because apparently seeing terroristic levels of destruction perpetrated almost nonstop by Mr. Sourface is uproarious). We also see Charlize Theron as she stands there having no chemistry with her fiancé (Bateman), and even less with Hancock, who she has a past with (and by past I mean a few incoherent sentences of wooden dialogue tossed out with no explanation). Long story short: Hancock manages to reign in his awfulness somewhat with the help of Bateman and his 2-dimensional nice-guy personality. Eddie Marsan stains his otherwise likable filmography by playing a bad guy who is bad (wow, what depth) in this sorry excuse for a film, tasteless attempts at humor are made in the form of bully children being tossed hundreds of feet in the air, a bad guy's hand getting chopped off with a metal disk, buildings getting smashed in half (by the 'good' guys, no less) and countless other wastes of cgi destruction that happen under the pretense of humor.Nothing was proved.

"Much better than the ""kill time"" before The Dark Knight I was expecting","I went to see The Dark Knight today and would have had to wait more than 2 hours for the next session - then I spotted ""Hancock"" starting in 15 minutes and would end 10-15 minutes before TDK started. As it was $10 Tuesdays it was an easy decision - see TWO movies instead of one! A mini marathon if you will! Hancock was actually a heck of a lot more entertaining than I expected. It has some moderately to very funny moments, awesome special effects (who wouldn't love to fly even if it is worse than ""The Greatest American Hero"" (William Katt)?) and a plot twist I never expected.As a Will Smith fan I thought it wasn't his best work but still rate his performance as... good. Hot babe Charlize was un-recognisable (ie she still looks gorgeous) and played a great role - just don't get her angry. I haven't seen Jason Bateman for ages but his performance in this film was an impressive re-introduction. Daeg Faerch (young Michael in the Halloween remake) has certainly grown up too - not sure if it his normal accent or he was just awesome in Halloween). And most of the supporting staff are well suited too.Generally production is of a high quality. If you are stuck for a movie after seeing the others doing the rounds you could do a lot worse than Hancock.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A different kind of Superhero movie,"Hancock may appear at first to be typical superhero movie like Spiderman, Hulk, Ironman etc... however the intent with this movie was to be outside the typical superhero movie genre - IE: don't expect super villain(s) and a back-story about Hancock's origins (although some of this is revealed in the movie, the origins aren't covered in much depth).Jason Bateman shines in this movie as a struggling Public Relations consultant who takes up the challenging role of Hancock's PR representative. Bateman's character is endearing to the viewer as we see his endless optimism for Hancock's potential, which results in some comical scenes between Bateman and Smith eg: ""Say 'Good Job Officer', 'goooooood jooooob'"" :).I was actually slightly disappointed by Charlize Theron's performance which has been criticized by others, but that is open to interpretation - let's just say she doesn't have a good poker face. However this doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment of the movie.As many of you will have already seen the trailers you may notice that this isn't really about any major conflict or world saving mission like all the other superhero movies. This was never the intention of Hancock. Put simply, it is the story of Hancock coming to terms with who he is and realizing his true potential - to be a great hero (rather than a bad hero).The special effects are good, the story is more humor than action, but it's a good enough mix to keep you entertained from start to finish. Hancock is an enjoyable, fun movie with a good storyline (for a comedy/action flick) that should satisfy all but the most demanding of viewers.7.5/10 (rounded-up to 8/10)",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Disappointing...Entertaining, but could be much more.","Sorry if my English is bad. ""Hancock"" is fun, is entertaining, but just on the beginning. The first half hour is cool, we have a lot of action and we meet Hancock. But later the movie turns a boring and senseless drama, which is not good.Will Smith is a great actor, but unfortunately he can't save the movie. Jason Bateman is really a cool guy, but he also can't save the movie. Charlize Theron is really beautiful, but your role is annoying.And one of the big problems of ""Hancock"" is that the director and the writers don't know if is a action, a drama, or a comedy movie.""Hancock"" is entertaining, but could be much more. Maybe visual effects and great actors are not enough without a good script in some movies. An excellent idea, wasted in a weak and bad movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great movie for what it is,"I thought about seeing this movie when it first came out in theaters, but I had my doubts. First of all, it's maintained a relatively hum-drum rating on IMDb since that time (not that I count that as a top factor, but it is a warning sign).Secondly, I am not a fan of ""superhero"" movies. I've always wanted to like the movies based on comic book heroes, but it's just not me, and I gave up several years back. The Incredibles was probably the only superhero movie I really enjoyed, apart from the great web-swinging scenes in the first Spiderman movie.Thirdly, I couldn't really tell from the few trailers I managed to see if it might actually be funny - and if not, what was it supposed to be? I think the answer to this question is what leads me to give the rating I'm giving.I didn't know what to expect from Hancock, and so when the opportunity finally arose, I just watched it.And I really enjoyed it. Hancock is part thigh-slapping comedy, part action movie, part melodrama, part romance, part absurdly dry observation, with generous slabs of comic book thrown in between.As one person pointed out, the plot was somewhat predictable in places, and yet we were still left guessing just enough - do you think it will happen this way or that way? And every time there was a new development, it caused us to think back to what we had seen 10 minutes before to ask ourselves if we had really seen it coming.We laughed, we grinned (wryly), we ""ewwwww""ed, and we said ""awwwww"". We didn't take the movie too seriously - it didn't take itself too seriously. And I think that's the main point. It tells a story, it makes it fun, adds pretty cool special effects, adds elements from a lot of different genres, and winds everything up nicely in the end.I am a reluctant fan of Will Smith. I didn't really know who he was as his fortunes were rising, and (being an avid rap-hater), I didn't really care. But despite myself, I am almost always impressed. I haven't seen all his movies, but his performances rarely if ever fail to leave me nodding in approval. I wouldn't exactly say this part was a dramatic stretch for him, but he was nicely cast, as were the other two leads.This is not the greatest movie since sliced bread, it is a nice, fun way to pass the time. Normally I would give it maybe 7 or 8 stars, but because I think it's gotten such a bad rap, I'm giving it a 9 for balance.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The second half ruins everything.,"The first half of Hancock was better than what I could have expected. Hancock is a homeless superhero with no respect whatsoever. The opening act has him stop an armed chase with a price tag of $7 million dollars in property damage. He destroys pavement wherever he lands. Everyone, from kids to criminals, call him an a-hole. Then the film gets surprisingly better. He saves the life of Ray, someone skilled but flawed at public relations and convinces Hancock to improve his image, by answering the demands of the public to answer for all his crimes, apologize and turn himself in. From this point, it all goes downhill from here, and it's the second half twist and ending that stinks up the whole movie, to the point where you don't care about how good the first half was anymore. How could they have screwed up such a good premise? Hancock's origin and weakness, though I will not spoil, are the mother of all cop-outs.It's not as if Hancock shows any Achilles heel in Will Smith or Charlize Theron's acting abilities. The second half of the film is that bad if an Academy Award winning actress who worked with Will before cannot pull it through. Throw in a pathetic stinker of a villain, a story of love and tortured relationships and Hancock is crushed by the weight of too many generic superhero clichés.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hancock Movie Review,"Hancock Movie Review Category: Action/Adventure/Superhero/Parody I was really excited and intrigued after seeing the previews for Hancock, starring Will Smith. It seemed like such an original concept, an antihero who everyone hates trying to redeem himself to the masses by going straight and looking good. But a mysterious menace looms for this superhero, called John Hancock. I admit I thought this move was going to be original, but not so original and weird to the point of excess.The Good: Will Smiths acting is a constant, you know thats going to be good regardless of the film. The special effects were also amazing and really intriguing, it really meshed well with the action sequences. This is also the first movie in which YouTube.com was seen so frequentely which I guess its a good thing. The various spurts of comedy were also really funny and welcomed. But the real good qualities of this movie ends here. Oh yeah and Charlize Theron looks super HOT! The Bad: So Original and Weird to the point of being a turnoff. The Script and Storyline needed some work, I don't know if the screenwriters overcomplicated the movie purposely, but the whole love story behind the movie to me was sort of unnecessary and stupid. There are a lot of questions to Hancocks origin that were not answered. As well as the behavior of the people in this fictitious Los Angeles, which was also sort of strange in a ""Last Action Hero"" sort of way. Jason Batemans character, Ray, had a too large part in this movie as well. It seems like the script was worked and rewritten various times and the end result was far from perfect which detracts lots of the movies enjoyability. The enemies of Hancock were also very spontaneous and were not well explained.The Ugly: Well, when you literally see BIG BOB in prison with a head shoved up his ass. LOL.Conclusion: Hancock is a great movie, to watch at the movies for the fantastic action sequences and special effects, as well as the comical moments of the movie. But the movie itself is too complicated and leaves many questions unanswered. The dialogue is really bad at times and I didn't know whether to take this movie seriously or not. But in the end I enjoyed even with the various downfalls, just because its Will Smith and the action was so good.Is it worth renting or buying or neither? Renting it once a year would be sufficientSupra Score: 6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An average superhero flick,"The last few will smith films have really been flops, his newer films just seem to be no depth and no real story to it. Hancock was just an over the cgi film with nothing that we haven't already seen before, From a shootout in a bank to a crash up of cars on the highway, the jokes are like 20 years old and to see people laughing at the same things as before is just disgusting. This is just another piece of crap that Hollywood have brought out that is a poor excuse for a movie, remember superman iv with Christopher reeves now that was a great movie and they didn't have a big budget and they didn't go over board with the special effects and even batman begins was really good and there again they made the movie right with little cgi effects and more just old fashioned filming. They only thing the movie had going for it was Jason bateman's role, he was the only real character in the film everyone else just seemed like a cardboard cutout. This film seems to be made like most other Hollywood films these days and that its target audience is the younger generation, in which the should make a film that targets all people an not just the young ones.If you were smart you would wait for the DVD or even wait for it to air on television.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Enjoyable, fun but not engrossing and brilliant!","A little time off work yesterday and myself and my fiancé decided to visit the cinema, we had three main choices as to what to watch (Hancock, Wanted or the new Hulk film). Having seen the trailers to Hancock I really wanted to see the film....I watched the film and thoroughly enjoyed it, it didn't make me think too much, it made me laugh enough and it passed the time......The few small problems I had with the movie were:(1) The lack of a decent, well worked, well acted villain (2) I wanted more drunken superhero mayhem (3) The last half hour or so didn't keep up the pace and laughs of the first hourWithout giving away spoilers the plot twist was good and well worked if under-explained......Overall 6 out of 10.....worth a watch for sure, Will Smith was excellent!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
There are heroes...there are superheroes...and then there's Hancock.,"With great power comes great responsibility -- everyone knows that -- everyone, that is, but Hancock. Edgy, conflicted, sarcastic, and misunderstood, Hancock's well-intentioned heroics might get the job done and save countless lives, but always seem to leave jaw-dropping damage in their wake. The public has finally had enough -- as grateful as they are to have their local hero, the good citizens of Los Angeles are wondering what they ever did to deserve this guy. Hancock isn't the kind of man who cares what other people think -- until the day that he saves the life of PR executive Ray Embrey, and the sardonic superhero begins to realize that he may have a vulnerable side after all. Facing that will be Hancock's greatest challenge yet -- and a task that may prove impossible as Ray's wife, Mary, insists that he's a lost cause.After seeing the theatrical trailer for this movie, I didn't really want to see it as much as most summer movies. I didn't want to see Will Smith acting like an a-hole is his movies. I don't think anyone does but I saw this film anyway. And you know what? This has got to be one of the biggest surprises this summer! I loved it! Hancock is a movie where it answers the question, ""What happens if a superhero just doesn't care?"" And it does it great! Will Smith plays well as the misunderstood superhero. He does a great job. Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron are good supporting roles. What I didn't like about the film is that it was marketed in a wrong way. What you see in the trailers for this film is basically the first thirty minutes of the entire movie. It's marketed as a superhero comedy. Well, the jokes are funny but there are also dramatic scenes in here. It adds a surprising sense of sweetness in the film.Unlike other superhero movies, ""Hancock"" isn't based on a comic book so no one really has an idea of what's going to happen in this film and that's what makes the movie so great! Finally, a superhero movie that isn't predictable (in most cases). The film does a great job giving us the information that we would need to know, although it doesn't answer all the questions we want to know, like how Hancock obtained his powers and so on and so forth. The movie also has some surprising twists and turns to keep audiences interested. When you think this is going to happen, a twist comes to keep you off guard which makes the film quite refreshing and original than most superhero movies. The action scenes are good, although maybe not as big and great as you expect it to be.And I must say, John Powell does an EXCELLENT job with the score for the film. I also think this is one of Peter Berg's better films. Now don't go expecting what the TV spots and trailers show you. The film is quite sweet and has a good moral message in the end and doesn't really have as many jokes as you would expect. Will Smith does a great job playing the character and the film is quite fresh and original. Like I said, this has got to be the biggest surprise of this summer so far! And yes, this movie is quite entertaining! Go see it!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Very enjoyable action comedy,"I liked the soundtrack and VFX effects, both were done well and the writing in this movie. We have development, origin story and good action scenes imo.

Hancock's one-and-a-half-hour is an hour of formula done well and then a disappointing conclusion.,"Here is a superhero film that has its superhero inhabit a world in which the inhabitants themselves demonise the superhero rather than glorify him. If we look at the film poster for Hancock, we can see him in all his 'ugly' glory, an immediately unflattering appearance; thrust into our faces with large sunglasses and an illogical for-the-genre hat which, in my opinion, makes him look more daft than anything else. But this is part of the pull for the film Hancock; the gimmick being that he does not need a mask or a costume (at first) to hide his true identity like Spider Man or Batman do but indeed almost welcomes criticism and exposure by turning up in the most unruly of manners and 'saving the day' in the most unorthodox of manners. The scene in which he stops a car from being hit by a train and a whale from dying on a beach could easily have been handled in a better and more logical manner, but it's almost as if Hancock deliberately hits the train and the boat in these scenes to create problems.But Hancock is really two different sorts of beast. You can envisage the pitch and the idea for the film revolving around a superhero of everyday 'quality' who goes on his own minute journey of discovery and re-image but I think that's as far as the film goes in terms of good ideas. That is to say, when a certain element does make itself known the resulting plot point is both disorientating and disappointing. But mercifully, rather than give us a great point of attack before lambasting us with a daft resolution, the film creates a jovial atmosphere for the first two-thirds and generally keeps us interested rather than merely entertained for this period  it is the final third that needed more care and attention with that sole plot point the reason for the film coming off the rails a tad.The first thing you do notice about the film, and you don't have to be in a multiplex to identify it, is its hero is African-American. It's good but somewhat interesting to see a superhero of the non-white variety to perhaps rival the character of Blade, comic books of course being written decades ago at times of, shall we say, 'racial indifference' and thus; the majority of comic book heroes are of course white. But the film is still needlessly racist towards certain groups: the French boy named Michael (Faerch) who doubles up as a neighbourhood bully towards Aaron Embrey (Head) of the Embrey family that takes Hancock in, is in particularly poor taste as is Hancock's stereotypical view on Norwegians and what they typically look like. Additionally, did any one else notice the ridiculous subtitles during the beginning chase as said by the Vietnamese gangsters? Some of the subtitles were not even grammatically correct suggesting the Vietnamese speak in that fashion anyway. From memory, I think one of the lines were ""What you doing here!?""But other than this the film is a textbook, and I mean textbook, example of how to establish a down and out character before rebuilding him and having him accomplish his goals. The film runs at 92 minutes according to IMDb, 62 minutes of those are the good stuff in which Hancock (Smith) will begin as a down and out guy; meet and be motivated by a mentor of some sort; go through a training montage (which are the prison scenes); overcome some fears and doubts before getting his opportunity to put ideas into practice and win through in the end. Some scenes that are in the textbook in this case are the ones in which Hancock begins to miss the basketball hoop and begins to speak out during the rehab seminars. He is then given the chance to redeem himself one day after receiving a phone call whilst in his cell  what will await him, him having learnt these new social skills and ability to channel energy?And so I can pinpoint the exact moment in which the film ends for me. It is when, during said test, the protagonist overcomes doubts and, in reference to cheesy superheroes of the past, gives a salute; wishes everyone luck in a booming 'Captain America' voice and probably should remind everyone to recycle or something, that he flies off having passed. From here the film hits a wall, a wall that even Hancock cannot recover from so God knows what it must've been made of. Certain coincidental revelations occur and I was disappointed since the film decides it needs a villain to round things off. Hancock is no longer a villain to himself so a third party needs to enter the fray and that was rather sad. Still, while it lasts Hancock is an entertaining and somewhat amusing ride although a lot of the jokes either miss the mark (such as the repeating 'pass' at the rehab) or are just not that funny for anyone aged over twenty.While the themes of religion feel out of place and the fact a certain group of individuals lay siege to a certain location for the finale to produce one of an explosive nature, Hancock is alright for what it is but what gripe I did have involved where Hancock was during most of the Twentieth Century  surely he could've helped out during the Pearl Harbour attack or the Munich Olympics hostage situation; I guess he, the slacker that he is, took those days off.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A lackluster blockbuster,"Hancock is like communism: a great idea on paper but it in the end, it's just doesn't work.Hancock (played by Will Smith) is a ne'er-do-well superhero. Sure, he'll save the day but he'll most likely do millions of dollars worth of damage in the process. He's drunk, sloppy and surly (my three favorite dwarfs). When Hancock happens to rescue P.R. man Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) from an oncoming train, Embrey decides to repay him by focusing his marketing skills on Hancock.In a running gag, Hancock has an aversion to being called a certain insulting term (Hint: it ends with ""hole""). Every time he hears it, he feels compelled to react to the person using the word. What's that you say? As a matter of fact, it is just like Marty McFly in Back To The Future II & III. It was a silly plot device then and it's a silly plot device now.This movie feels like three different films cobbled together. There's the ""funny"" Hancock, there's the ""grim and gritty"" Hancock and there's the ""action/adventure"" Hancock. Any of them could have workednone of them did.Movies of this sort often create their own rules when it comes to the physical laws of nature. But if a film is going to do that, those rules need to remain consistent. At one point Hancock begins to lose his powers. But while this makes him no longer invulnerable he still posses his super strength. At another point, Hancock throws a child what must have been at least a mile in the air (and this is the ""funny"" Hancock, by the way) and catches him while standing still. In the real world, even if Hancock would have caught him he would have, at best, broken the kid's back. In a movie with a lighter tone, perhaps a Spiderman movie, this wouldn't be too much of a problem. But Hancock wants to be somewhat grounded in reality. Hancock is facing multiple lawsuits, he's wanted by the police but they have no real way to apprehend him because of his superpowers, when he lands at full speed he destroys the pavement. So when they completely break with reality for a cheap joke, it rings hollow.What little positive there is in this film comes from Will Smith and Jason Bateman. Smith and Bateman have real chemistry and it's a shame they weren't given something better to work with. While Bateman isn't really a big enough star to haggle over the screenplay quality of a summer tent pole picture, Will Smith most certainly is.For a screenplay that's supposedly been floating around Hollywood for over a decade, this movie seems hastily made. If you've ever wanted to see a superhero film without a super-villain, here's your chance. (And you might want to hurry because judging by the quality of this movie, I'm guessing it's your last chance.) I'm not really sure who this movie is for. It's too dark for younger kids and too juvenile for adults.The special effects are overly cartoonish. On more than one occasion, the director tries to hide substandard effects by having the camera move in a shaky, jerky fashion.Hancock is a mess.On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being Men In Black and 1 being Wild, Wild West, Hancock gets a 4.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Hancock falls short,"Well, what too say about this one. An interesting premise to be sure, but it suffers from a poor 2nd half. The 1st half was very well done, both funny and believable, but once the dramatics started up in the 2nd half, with Hancock's backstory and twist, it became ridiculous. While the backstory was somewhat tolerable, the twist was not very well done. It felt incomplete and rushed like the writers wanted to do something far more with the story but they had ran out of ideas/time and decided to slap something on at the end. Once again, Will Smith is well, Will Smith. While he does a commendable job as always, much like his last venture, I Am Legend, he is once again letdown by an under developed script. Overall, Hancock wasn't a terrible film by any means, but it could have been so much more than what it ended up being, another mediocre superhero film.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hancock (2008) **1/2,"I have to hand it to Will Smith... after having little use for him early on I've come to enjoy seeing him on the screen in his most recent films, even if none of them really blew me away. The guy has become an appealing actor to watch. That said, I was disappointed with HANCOCK because it started out with such promise but then took a complete turn in the wrong direction somewhere 'round the midway point and ruined for me what was shaping up to be a good film.Hancock (Smith) is a drunken hobo who, we learn right from the beginning, has been somehow endowed with special superhero-like abilities. He is invincible, cannot be harmed in any way, and spends his time flying and leaping into all sorts of local catastrophes to help people and set things straight. Yet for all his seemingly virtuous intentions, he is a cynical personality with a clumsy knack for not knowing his own strength and destroying streets and property in the casual manner in which he works his good deeds. As a result, rather than being loved and appreciated, he is vilified and condemned by the citizens of California and all of the news media. But there is hope when an aspiring ad man and his wife (Jason Bateman and the beautiful Charlize Theron) see the potential in helping Hancock better utilize his powers and gain the approval of the world.Without ruining anything for those who haven't seen the movie, the plot begins to thicken around this point and not for the better, in my opinion. What began as a touching and funny sentiment starts to mutate into something else entirely and, what's even more detrimental, there arise too many unnecessary explanations addressing Hancock's exceptional abilities which then leaves nothing to the wonderment of your imagination. These detours cripple the chance for HANCOCK to be something special. **1/2 out of ****",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

This looks like a job for HANCOCK!,This movie is a great bit of fun imagine Superman as a drunken bum who just does not care. Hancock is here for a reason or reasons whatever the reason is he forgot. Hancock is of course the only superhero on a planet that might once have worshipped him and he well somehow he becomes Embittered and loses heart and as a result he fight crimes half heartedly he creates a lot of damage and people get hurt. Hancock has become a menace to us without really meaning too the question is who can stop him? Enter a publicity agent wonderfully underplayed by Jason Bateman who is saved by Hancock from being killed by a train. He decides to recreate Hancock's image. Hancock at first refuses by soon sees the truth as the agent tells him just what is going on and how the world now sees him as a menace. Hancock also discovers a missing piece of his life that has near tragic consequences for him. That piece is the agent's wife Superbly played by Charlize Theron who matches will smith step for step quip for quip she makes Smith Better by not underplaying against him instead she makes him Act stronger which is all the better for us. Now the bad parts are this the movie while quite good comes across as uneven in some scenes the story feels unpolished and quite rough this is not Will Smith's best film but it's not his worst. The directer Peter Berg starts out with great intentions but it feels as if he lost steam along the way and decided to use a short cut to finish the film. I felt cheated somehow as if the movie promised one thing and delivered another oh to be fair I enjoyed it quite a bit it just was not what I expected it to be.,,Anonymous,Fantasy
Last Half of this movie truly disappointing!,"Plot: A drunk and homeless superhero named Hancock (Will Smith), that only fights crime when he is bored or bothered in to it by a kid. After saving the life of a advertising agent (Jason Bateman) from a train. Decides he owes it to Hancock to change his image and make this town need him and treat him like a real superhero, and what happens is a mix of comedy/action.My Spiel: I am a big fan of Will Smith, I like about everyone of his movies (except Wild Wild West). I really liked Will Smith with his witty acting making this movie have some truly funny parts from the beginning with drunken Hancock trying to do the right thing but screws it up no matter what he does. But then near the end I kind of lost interest and mainly wanted it to go a different route. Granted there were plot twists from a friend from the past revealing Hancock's past. Which was a lot to take in, in such a short notice. Then out of the blue a not so spectacular villain for Hancock to really care or truly worry about, but with the new found weakness of Hancock's which was a little convenient to make the villain able to hurt him and make us feel that Hancock should be in trouble. This all was just a little to coincidental that's all I'm saying! All in all many Will Smith fans will see threw this and like it for what it is, and that it is another Superhero movie but with the spark of Will Smiths attitude to turn it into something special.Hancock (2008) Review: 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Every Hero has their fatal flaw,"Batman is the ""Dark Knight"" because he is what he fears and what he wants his enemies to fear a bat. This unique spin creates a dark superhero rare in comics. Spiderman has the tag line, "" with great power comes great responsibility."" He continually grapples with this throughout the comics, its what makes him likable. My point here is, every superhero has unique emotional attributes that help contribute to their mystique and popularity. Then there's Hancock.Hancock is a great idea, a fowl-mouth, drunk, politically incorrect superhero. And it makes senses, it must be hard to be all alone and really I'm sure collateral damage is sometimes hard to avoid as we've learned from The Incredibles. All in all the premise is great and some-what shocking. The tone was definitely more R than PG in parts, but it was enjoyable none the less.The problem is once Hancock starts getting into the groove of becoming his own brand of superhero like the greats I listed earlier, it starts to veer of into an unexpected and unwelcome twist.The main problem with the twist is it fails to flesh out the basis of Hancock's character and his unique superhero identity, basically him being an asshole. If they had continued to make it more comical than emotional I could have easily enjoyed the twist. Instead it throws on tons of throwaway background dialog and emotional tripe that doesn't belong unless its coupled with Hancocks trademark toilet humor, which it is not.Too many people are being caught up on the twist, but the twist isn't the problem the problem is the emotional weight of the twist is not coupled with the enigmatic humor that precipitated it and made Hancock's initial 45 minutes so enjoyable.I don't hate this movie. Not at all, it is good, but not great. There are definitely better comic movies out this summer. Pretty much all of them, ( Wanted, The Hulk, Iron Man.) But, it isn't a bad movie either and it is enjoyable to watch, it just has me scratching my head. Is Hancock's fatal flaw his toilet-humor attitude, or his lack of storytelling chops.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

So Real,"So many movies take place in a comic book universe - that is, one that's not REAL. One of the things I really liked about Hancock, was that while there's a superhero in it, it takes place in a world that's very real. People react like you would expect REAL people to react. Seeing a superhero that's not perfect - he steps up and tries, but he forgets that the rest of the world are regular people. Tearing off the side of a building is EXPENSIVE. I remember when I saw Ghost Rider, and they showed the devastation to the city street after GR tears it up, and I thought, ""Wow, you never see that! They always just wreak havoc, destroy the city, and then go have a soda while the world rebuilds behind their back. This is COOL."" Hancock was cooler :P The characters are great - but make no mistake, Will Smith and Charlize Theron are very, very good in this movie, but Jason Bateman plays the real hero. He may have reminded me a teensy bit too much of his character from Arrested Development, but let's face it, most of his characters have a similiarity. Doesn't matter - he was perfect. By the end, I was clapping and cheering for HIM.Don't pay any attention to what others say - this is a movie that you have to see for yourself; I could probably find something negative to say about it, but that would spoil it, and since I loved the ending, I won't spoil it by complaining about how I ALMOST didn't like how it ended.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Worst Movie of the Summer,"I am surprised to see the incredible reviews our critics gave for this movie. So good that I decided to go watch it. The first half of the movie allowed it to be a Will Smith ""July 4th Weekend"" blockbuster; however, the remaining half left it standing alone with ""CodeName:The Cleaner"". Yes, Garbage. Please don't go watch this movie, instead spend the money towards your future funeral. Both things will have things in common, sad and tragic.....The story-line came from a 3 year old child that watched one too many hours of cartoon network. I understand this to be a super-hero movie, but its content did not go together well from beginning to end. Yes, cheesy and corny are the correct words to sum up this movie. Don't Watch it!",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
okie dokie,"The special effects aren't as good as a movie like Transformers, but at least you aren't getting an animated CGI character hopping around like you do in Hulk and Spiderman. It appears that several elements of this movie may be inspired by the now defunct Broadway Comics. The classic scene of a car being skewered on a spire was depicted in the ""Powers That Be"" comic and the dysfunctional marriage relationship in the movie is not unlike the ""Shadow State"" comic by Broadway. Perhaps seeing similar depictions hit the big screen made me appreciate the movie more. You
got to give credit to Will Smith for his role in the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Has some good elements, but never quite makes sense; special effects are very fine","Hancock (Will Smith) is NOT your average superhero. Yes, he has powers that probably exceed Superman, Spiderman and just about any other magical crime fighter. But, he lives like a homeless man, drinks like a fish, and uses foul language in his efforts. Although he has saved lives in the Los Angeles area, he has also destroyed property. The powers that be, and the common folk alike, sneer at him. One day, however, he saves the life of a public relations officer, Ray (Jason Bateman) whose car is stuck on a train track. Its quite a rescue since Ray's car ends upside down. Although all bystanders make fun of Hancock, Ray thanks him heartily and takes him home to dinner. Once there, Hancock awes Ray's son, Aaron, but doesn't impress the PR man's gorgeous wife, Mary (Charlize Theron). Strange, since he saved her hubby's life. As Hancock wolfs down his plate of spaghetti and meatballs, Ray offers his help. What Hancock really needs, says Ray, is an image change. If he stops drinking and swearing and even goes to jail, briefly, for the havoc he has caused, the superhero can be loved and appreciated again. What a concept! Hancock actually agrees to the plan and ends up in jail, where he refuses to use his powers, except on the basketball court. But, when Mary and Aaron visit, Hancock is confused about his feelings for Ray's wife. Mary is, in fact, harboring secrets, which spill out in good time. These hidden truths could change the lives of Ray, Mary, Aaron, Hancock and the world. What will happen? This is an entertaining film, thanks to nice performances by the principal three actors and great special effects. Smith is always a charmer, Theron is a lovely and fine actress and Bateman's surprises with his ""nice guy"" turn, without a bit of sarcasm. As stated, the effects are a huge bonus, with cars ending up on top of skyscrapers, basketballs going through hoops acres away from the shooter and the like. Nevertheless, it can't be considered a bonafide winner for a few reasons. One, the plot is imaginative but doesn't truly make sense and falls flat near the end. Then, too, parents will not be pleased with the initial appearances of Hancock, where he is guzzling booze from a fifth, using bad language and showing little respect for anyone. Since Hancock does undergo a nice reformation, older children will benefit if parents watch the film with them. Indeed, the lessons of Hancock on living a ""decent life"" are one of the best aspects of the entire movie. Therefore, if you are a fan of the cast, science fiction, and/or superhero flicks, get Hancock soon.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not your typical superhero movie,"Hancock had a good idea on making a superhero not so perfect. For the first 45 minutes or so it works, but then there is the surprise twist which didn't quite do it for me. On top of this there is no real strong villain to complement the hero. THe acting was pretty good, but otherwise this movie is just a little better than average.Hancock (Will SMith) is a drunken superhero who is the total anti-thesis of your typical hero. He swears, insults people, and uses his powers in a destructive manner, but you can see that deep down he wants to help people and doesn't know the exact way to make himself look better in the eyes of the people. Enter Ray (Justin Bateman) as a PR guy who wants to change Hancock's image for the better. On top of this we have Ray's wife Mary (Charlize THeron) who we can tell by the way she acts around Hancock that they have some type of history together that Hancock is not sure of. I 'll go no farther into the plot, but I will say that with Ray's help, Hancock does change his image for the better, and near the end of the film starts becoming mortal for reasons I can not tell without spoiling the movie.The acting is rather well done, but the special effects do not look as if 150 million was spent. I can accept cheesy special effects if the story works, but with Hancock the story never takes off because he has no real strong villain to face off against. The ending is rather weak, but the acting is well enough to carry it somewhat though not enough for me to recommend it.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Cockhan,"With so many, many, many, many, many, many, many superhero movies bombarding audiences these days its hard to remember a time when there wasn't an unnecessary comic-book adaptation being forced in our increasingly tired faces. When Hancock was released in 2008 there was no DCEU, and there wasn't really an MCU either. Comic-book movies (of which this is not) and superhero movies were still struggling and finding their feet. Outside of Spider-Man, many of them were alienating and disappointing audiences (Hulk, Superman Returns, Fantastic Four) and while that may still be the case with most of these exhausting franchises, they are so ubiquitous that the hits cover-up the significant misses.Hancock divided audiences in 2008 with many not understanding what it was trying to say or do. Now, more than ever, is it time to give Hancock a re-evaluation?Will Smith (as his career was beginning a downturn) stars as a man with an unknown past who has superpowers, only his faith in people and enthusiasm for life causes the citizens of his hometown of Los Angeles to not appreciate his careless, lazy efforts at fighting crime and rescuing those in trouble. When he saves idealist public relations expert Ray Embrey (the always delightful Jason Bateman) from a trainwreck he is encouraged to turn around his attitude and allow the world to embrace him as a hero who really cares. But Ray's wife Mary (Charlize Theron) has secrets of her own and might know everything about Hancock's mysterious past.This alone would have been enough to make a unique, adult-themed superhero movie, but it seems that several re-writes of the script decided that some kind of villain needed to be shoehorned in there where it didn't belong, and the movie flounders in the final act as a standard Hollywood ending conflicts and deflates the many new ideas that came before it. I still enjoy it way more than Deadpool (an ugly, depressing film which I despise). The 92-minute running time screams of a difficult time in the editing room and the struggle to find a traditional narrative in the flurry of ideas that were written, re-written, re-drafted, and re-arranged during the scripting phase. The movie was originally written in 1996 with the rather worrying title of Tonight, He Comes and was about a kid who struck up a friendship with a fallen superhero - really quite different from the final product.With no toxic fanbase behind it, Hancock comes with a clean slate and is enjoyable as a comedy with some okay action scenes. We're all jaded and indifferent to this stuff by now and the physics and frequent 9/11 porn of superhero movies has been done to absolute, stone-cold, death, DEATH, D-E-A-T-H. Please stop making these! At least it doesn't end with a big blue light shooting up into the sky.Peter Berg's direction is always merely a pastiche of whatever his peers are doing at the time, and Hancock has no unique visual flair, which would have been just fine if the original idea at its core was allowed to shine through the muddle of changes it obviously went through. It's a horse made by a committee.It's a camel.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hancocks a Hit,"Will Smith does it again with his new summer blockbuster hit Hancock. The movie starts off fast and doesn't let up until the very end. Smith and Bateman show good chemistry and work well together. The movie hits you in the face with a couple of twists and original schemes that I have yet to see in other films. Nonetheless, at the end of the movie I still felt that there was just something missing to keep this movie in the race with other summer blockbusters like Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk. Still yet, the action sequences and special effects were fantastic. I didn't think this movie was as good as some of the other movies Smith has done in the past, but its still a must see film for the summer.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hancock: The Beginning sealed the deal.,"Hancock isn't a film for everyone. I truly believe the trailer gave the wrong impression to a wide vote of people that the movie was going to be a comedy. The movie even starts off of a comedic foot only to switch feet abruptly about 45 minutes in. Was the shift to drama unneeded? Yes, the movie could've done perfectly fine without if it kept up it's upbeat comedy tempo but the shift did add some substance to the film although the shift to the drama wasn't the smoothest of shifts. Will Smith did a great job as did Charlize Theron but who really came out and did the best was Jason Batemen. My only true gripe with Hancock was the repetition of some scenes (i.e. Prison Talk Scene, Basketball Scene) and the crappy camera work in the majority of the shots. Now while the remainder of the movie after the shift was no where near the greatness of the beginning half, the movie still lands out at solid 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It should be bashed here,"This movie should be bashed. The writers should be ashamed of themselves. The actors are great, but so what. If ANY other actors were placed in this movie, it would be a B-Movie. Make that a D. C-R-A-P. I LOVE the actors, think they are excellent. But completely wasted here. It started off as a good idea... but then it just seemed as though the writers said, ""Screw it! I'm tired of actually writing this. Let's just say *this* happens, and call it a day. It's been a whole 37 minutes we've spent writing this, and I need a drink."" DO NOT go and spend your hard earned money on this.

Hancock,"A hugely enjoyable superhero movie offering a unique take on the genre, not only through having the hero be an alcoholic, homeless, antisocial liability but also because of the unexpected level of emotional depth it reaches.Jason Bateman is wonderful as the mild-mannered, good-hearted PR man who takes Hancock under his wing and helps him turn his life around. Charlize Theron makes less of a first impression but really comes into her own when the major plot twist is revealed.The script isn't frequently laugh-out-loud funny but it's consistently amusing and one scene involving two prisoners threatening Hancock is an absolute classic and worth the price of admission alone. Hancock's Kryptonite comes in an unusual form and whereas these things often end up somewhat gimmicky - the green stuff is a case in point - in Hancock not only is it a neat idea but it actually serves the story.Producer Michael Mann's stamp is all over it, and it's shot in a gritty, realistic style that is at first jarring but as the plot unfolds and the tone establishes itself becomes perfectly fitting.It suffers maybe from a weak villain who's introduced too late and the rotten CGI in a movie with this budget is unforgivable, but those are about the only serious things it has going against it.The trailers and TV spots made this look thoroughly obnoxious but renting it despite my better judgement I found it to be not only a lot of fun but one of the most emotionally mature superhero movies out there, and probably the most moving of the ones I've seen.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hancock!,"Will Smith is a famous actor. He acted in the recent movie, I am Legend and his movies usually make a lot of money. His new movie, Hancock, is good fun although there are some disappointment. I have seen Peter berg's The kingdom which is intense with big gun shootout in the end. I must say that Hancock almost has the same style of The Kingdom- the unsteadiness of the camera, things that explode and some more. The fight scenes and the villains should be better, it is not what I expected but because of the story.The story: Will Smith plays Hancock, a destructive superhero who does not care about destroying people's things like cars, train and buildings. People hate him. He saves a guy, Ray, who considerably asks Hancock to do what he is supposed to. Hancock spends his time in jail, trying to turn a new leaf. Soon, when crimes rates are rising, Hancock saves the world. Just the usual superhero story but Hancock is a superhero that is destructive and says anything he want to say. Unlike other superheroes who are usually good and well-mannered, Hancock does anything he like- not taking things into consideration. I would not really call this an usual superheroes movies, it would be more of an action drama with people with powers added.Overall: Is it good? Well,I would say that it is okay. I thought it could have done more better. With the runtime, it is okay as it is made that it would not be boring. There are twists on the way to the end. Other than that, it got the humour and Will Smith is good. If you are a fan of Will Smith, you should probably catch this out. If you like superheroes movies, this one should fit you but don't expect too much. It would be good to watch this in cinema, you get to see some thrilling action rushing into your way.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hancock,"It's been a lot of discussion about the movie here on IMDb, but most of it isn't about the movie...it's about Will Smith's personal life. So to all those who cares more about Will Smith's personal life and faith are going to be disappointed because i'm not going to bring that up...Hancock My expectations? Were not high but not that low either, i expected a few laughs but nothing impressing. Turns out that i was wrong, i laughed more than a few times and the movie was in some ways pretty impressing.How? With the fact that they managed to create a perfect mix of three different genre's Comedy,Action And Drama...In the beginning i thought ""Here we go again. Another top box office, lame comedy. But later into the movie it really got more interesting, the jokes were pretty well written, the actings were decent but at least they weren't horrible.Then later on came the part i wasn't to happy about, the drama part...it became too much...in my opinion it didn't fit in there at all. Maybe this is just me, but i think that if the movie would have continued the way it had been until the later part, it definitely would have got higher ratings...Hancock is a film including funny comics and some decent drama parts, i'd never thought this but the original score wasn't pretty bad. So there for, Hancock gets a 7.5/10, it's worth the money...and drop all that scientology crap and give it a shot",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's a good movie and I liked it; could've used more oomph.,"Hancock is original. It's not Marvel or DC but it wears it's comic book adventure elements on it's sleeve in live-action form. Will Smith gives a good performance as well as Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron (DAMN this woman is SEXY!!) admirably. I enjoyed the action and touching moments Hancock and the special effects are good in a naturalistic setting with some well-timed comedic moments thrown in. The fact that it's not an entirely superhero movie is also a plus and that makes it stand out a little amongst the big-name superhero movies coming out this summer; namely Hellboy 2 and The Dark Knight. However, the only fault in Hancock is that there's no real central villain and not enough info on Will and Theron's origins and the possibilities of others like them (especially towards the climax). There's no doubt I couldn't help but feel that some juicy material was removed from the final cut. So in all respects, Hancock is a good film and I must say that I liked it and is original in it's presentation but the film could've used more oomph, content wise. I'm sure it made a lot at the box-office and got good reviews. Only time will tell if it's successful enough to warrant a sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Tarnishing the image,"John Hancock (Will Smith), known universally as Hancock, is an alcoholic bum. But wait! He's a superhero. He can fly, he is super-powerful, he can catch bad guys. Let's put it this way: Hancock is a superhero in need of a recovery program. Besides his drinking he has rage issues. And he just isn't very nice. He also is very, very messy. In the course of one of his rescue missions he usually causes millions of dollars in unnecessary damage. The media is full of complaints about all this.And that's where PR man Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) comes in. They meet when Hancock saves Ray from being run over in his car by a train (of course Hancock also wrecks the train and smashes up a lot of vehicles caught in the surrounding traffic jam). Hancock takes Ray home (with his messed up car, through the air) and gets to know Ray's wife Mary (Charlize Theron) and little boy Aaron (Jae Head). Superheros do eat, and Hancock develops an instant jones for Mary's ""spaghetti madness"" dinners.The upshot of this rather unusual encounter determines the rest of the movie. Ray sets to work to remake Hancock's image and his behavior. At Ray's urging Hancock turns himself in to do prison time for all the laws he has broken (it seems superheroes can be subject to the law as well as the pleasures of pasta). In the clink, Hancock's thrown in with some pretty rough characters. He goes to meetings where men share about their problems but time after time he just says ""pass"" when it comes to him.Eventually Hancock cleans up his act in more ways than one. Released because he's needed by the city, he learns to say ""Good job"" to overwhelmed cops he's helping, shaves, gets a haircut, washes, cuts down on the booze, and wears a nice tight leather superman outfit Ray has provided. Maybe the ""good jobs"" are the most important pert.Ray's success with Hancock leads the corporations to get back in touch with Ray about his pet scheme to have them give away billions to end disease and poverty in return for sporting a giant heart symbol that will make people love them. Meanwhile a rather unusual relationship is developing between Hancock and Mary. But we can't talk about that because it's meant to be a surprise. It is a surprise. It's also ridiculously far-fetched and elaborate and requires pages of expository dialogue. And that's where 'Hancock,' which was fading once Hancock turned nice, fizzles out. The final rounds of CGI and derring-do and bangs and smashes are redundant, because they don't develop Hancock's initial premise any more.The interest of that premise was that perfection is boring. The gods of the ancient Greeks had lots of imperfections, and a superman who sleeps on a city bench in a grungy watch cap with an eagle on it, grumpy and reeking of alcohol, is intriguing. It's also potentially a little bit repulsive, especially given Hancock's foul language. A little human weakness is appealing, but we don't really want our heroes to be quite such a mess, and there's a mean and sadistic streak to Hancock that is troubling.The character of Ray helps to counteract this. Jason Bateman, a guy who has done a lot of TV and is best known for his role in ""Arrested Development,"" has a resilient nice-guy quality and at times Ray seems to be the main character and Hancock just his project. But should that be? We turn away from Hancock because his character is skewed too far to begin with. Nonetheless the movie deserves credit for taking the superhero idea in a whole new direction, and so does Will Smith for running with it, and the equally charismatic Theron for tagging along.Once Hancock gets all cleaned up and people start to like him we realize this isn't enough, and so did the writers. Unfortunately where they go from there was boring and comes from a more conventional and hokey kind of superhero movie. We want to know more about Hancock--we want to know what has become of his humanness--and instead we're getting lectured about angels and millennia.Will Smith is a superstar--never mind the hero part--and people are flocking to see this movie because of him. But Hancock coats him with a layer of meanness and grumpiness that keeps the Will Smith charisma from coming out the way it does in his best performances, most recently and notably in 'The Pursuit of Happiness' and 'I Am Legend.' And unfortunately Peter Berg, whose last outing was the ham-handed 'The Kingdom,' has yet to show much finesse as a director. It's hard to tell in the end how much of the messiness is due to the out-of-whack superhero and how much is just a lack of directorial restraint. And yet you've got to admire both Berg and Smith for attempting to take an old theme in a new direction.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A waste of talent.,"After witnessing half a summer of great blockbusters (Iron Man, Hulk, WALL-E, Wanted), and being a fairly big Will Smith fan, I have to admit I went into this movie with pretty high expectations. This movie has been talked about and advertised for a good 6 months, and i bought into the hype. Don't make the same mistake I did. What can you expect from this movie? Crater sized plot holes! A conflicting script! Lame CGI effects! One of the worse third acts ever! I am all about turning off my brain and just enjoying a good summer movie, but this movie is not only laughable, but boring! That being said the film does have some things going for it. Will Smith does raise it from disaster to extereme mediocrity. Some of the jokes do connect, and are somewhat funny. The twist works for a minute, but then it falls into something extremely uninteresting. And then there is the finale, which is so incomprehesible and ridiculous that it ruins everything good that happened before it.The worst movie I have seen this summer, the worst of Will Smith's career, and one of the worst this year.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
top notch superhero film with a twist,"Hancock is an enjoyable superhero film with a twist, as the superhero is often drunk, sleeping on the streets or is causing more damage to the city than the criminals that he is chasing.it is a humorous twist that director Peter Berg plays around with, but does not suck it for all it is worthit has a subtle sense of dark humor, and Will Smith gives everything to his role as the sympathetic bum, and it pays off, as well as the supporting castin the end, this superhero film is a funny look at superheroes and the way we look at them",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A fun night in.,"Hancock is quite simply Will Smith's best comedy film since 1997's Men In Black (we'll ignore MIB:II). As the title suggests, the film follows Hancock, an alcoholic 'superhero' living in Los Angeles who causes nothing but trouble and unnecessary damage whilst saving lives.Hancock isn't your typical superhero movie and wasn't what I expected in most aspects. Although it's not exactly a huge budget movie based on a Marvel or DC Comics character (Spiderman 3 had a budget $58million more than Hancock) the special effects aren't too bad, with the exception of the computer generated fight, it's just too obviously CGI.At the risk of sounding offensive, Will Smith is brilliant at playing a rude and obnoxious character. He pulls of the 'a**ehole' character pretty well. Writers Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan really know how to create a 3D character that the audience genuinely cares about.Although it does start to drag on a little towards the end, it really keeps you interested right up until the end credits start to roll. It's laugh out loud funny at times, the twist is brilliant and there's even a little tribute to Superman in there, if you can spot it.Watch it, it's a fun night in.http://ukmore.tk/",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
23 Railway Cuttings?,"I watched this film expecting a true-to-life biopic of the legendary British comedian Tony Hancock, but once again it seems that Hollywood just had to change to story to suit the idiotic public.Charlize Theron was very badly cast as Sid James, Hancock's erstwhile sidekick, and there was no mention whatsoever of some of his famous sketches like the blood donation and the economy drive.I have nothing against Will Smith but casting a black actor into a white role is just political correctness gone mad!!

"Cracking first 46 minutes. Then, oh dear.","If the credits had rolled after 46 minutes, I'd be raving about this as one of the best films I've seen in years. Hilarious, profane and bracingly original, with a killer performance from Will Smith and a deliciously dry one from Jason Bateman. Unfortunately it completely falls apart after that, morphing into a metaphysical love story of rare incoherence and tedium. Rarely have I come across a film - or a book, or a record, or a meal - with such a gaping gulf between the quality of its first half and its second. Gaah. The script was in development for 10 years, being fundamentally re-written with no input from the original author. Could that by any chance be something to do with it?",,Anonymous,Fantasy

Finally a Will Smith performance I can get behind,"I'm normally the first person to criticise Will Smith and his corny self-aggrandising performances, so credit where credit's due- he's actually pretty good in this movie. The role of Hancock suits him down to the ground and allows him to show off his talents without making you want to stick your fingers down your throat.The concept of the flawed superhero in need of a PR expert is great and for the most part it plays out very nicely. However, the story goes off the deep end towards the end and loses its self-awareness to a large extent as the Hollywood theatrics creep in. Having said that, this is a nice short film that doesn't drag on or weigh you down with backstory and pretentiousness. The fairly average CGI and predictable ending prevent it from being particularly memorable but it is certainly far better than I expected.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The writers of the film also tossed in a nice plot twist that I didn't see coming but it turned out to work just fine. This isn't Shakespeare so I don't demand a lot of deep thought just some escapist fun. Will Smith does an excellent job of playing the disinterested superhero with an existential crisis. It was good to see Jason Bateman again but a bummer as well seeing how he has aged. This means I am not so young myself anymore. Jae Head didn't overact nor did the script writers push the ""cute"" button to the point of being saccharine.

Desperate,"Hancock was a most frustrating experience. With cinema ticket prices rising, the quality of American summer blockbusters is falling. The makers of this film failed so badly to appeal to an audience of fans of the 'lethal weapon' movies with it's outdated attempts at homophobic 'humour', and down and out heroes that it shows how desperate Hollywood is for original stories. It thinks it is progressive by presenting a story of fateful inter-racial partners with no qualms and on the flip-side mocking homosexual people. WRONG! The movie-going public has progressed further than this. I will never watch a movie directed by Peter Berg again, nor a movie starring Will Smith again, for their egos have been far too well fed.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Depressing and cliché,Depressing and cliché. As were all the comedies in the 2000s. Hate movies like this.Watching this makes me feel like I'm wasting my life.It's also stylized to be way more yellow than it should be which makes it feel even more depressing.,,Anonymous,Fantasy

Nothing Short Of Awesome,"This movie gets criticized sometimes because I bet some people didn't watch the whole thing. I've heard people say that the comedy in this movie is unrealistic. I couldn't disagree more. Hobo drinking a lot. Realistic. Hobo smells like liquor and destroys stuff unintentionally. Not realistic, but still funny. Well, you get the point. I have also heard people criticize this movie because a woman is one of the heroes. Are you derogatory much, people? I am not a woman, I am a dude, but I do think every once in a while you should add woman superheroes into movies to keep things mixed up and fresh. But, that is just what I think. Oh, before I start actually reviewing this movie, if you are watching it with a small kid, which, I don't think you should do, turn off the subtitles and you hear probably 10 less cuss words than you would if you had the them on. Anyway, this movie is very, very good. I think that almost everything was spot-on with what you want in an action or superhero movie, meaning that everything a action/superhero fan would like, like the flying, super strength, or super speed. Well, sort of super speed. In this movie, unlike many others, the superhero doesn't picture his self as a hero, famous, and super hot. The hero pictures himself sort of as an average Joe, if you know what I mean. Just goes to regular houses, doesn't have a larger than superhuman persona (heehee, funny), and just looks like a regular guy. He doesn't have huge, gigantic muscles, he just has muscles. And I think that really enriches the story because it gives you a sense of realism. It also makes the story a tiny bit more believable. It's not believable, really, but I'm sure you know what I mean. The special effects of this movie are also very believable, because most of the scenes don't require a huge amount special effects. Some do, though. This means that a lot of times, there is not tons of effort needed for the special effects people, which have a lot of skill in this field. OK, so I guess it's about time I review the three main aspects of the film, as I call them. They are acting, directing, and the dialogue, as well as music. The acting was pretty much great, except for the fact that sometimes the delivery of punchlines aren't delivered very well. There isn't the much desired ""umph"" of good punchlines. I guess that goes along with dialogue, too. Other than that, the acting was displayed very well by Theron and Smith, who actually made a good duo. They made a kind of combination that makes sparks, but not romantically. Meaning that they just fit together without the slightest problem. Ray Embrey, played by Jason Bateman, is also a great addition to the movie. He provides some of the comedy of the movie, but not as much as Smith does. He is the soft character of the movie, and keeps the tone of the film light when it is needed. Jae Head, as usual, is a great acting kid, and did a wonderful job in this movie, as he did in The Blind Side. Good movie, by the way. The directing style of this movie is fairly unique, because instead of still cameras and slow panning to the sides, it is fast- paced, and action-y. It also isn't still, but isn't so shaky that it gives you a headache. It's kind of in the middle, where a lot of people like it, including me. That's really all I can say about the directing. The dialogue, now. The dialogue is really good in this movie, and I'm serious. The movie has a sense of realism, and it is enhanced very much by the masterful writing. There isn't a big line with a dude in tights that is said on top of a mountain, which can only work in a select few superhero movies. The writers did a really good job fitting in some of the back story in the movie, that unfolds gradually and smoothly. Which really isn't found that much anymore. Also, the costume isn't super blingy and in your face. It's just a leather suit with some designs on it. I guess I liked the movie a lot more than I would have if it was a normal superhero flick because it gave you a break from all of that in your face stuff. The writers did throw in a lot of unnecessary cursing in there. Honestly, I don't care, but there were about 20 use of the a word combined with hole, that it added about 15 seconds to the movie. All by saying that word. Just thought that was kind of unneeded. It's one of the reasons I gave this only an 8. The writers also made some good quotes for Hancock, which are all said so that they are funny and comedic, instead of serious and unfunny. Which also made the dialogue better. Now the music. The music really didn't stand out that much but there was one scene that used the theme from Sanford & Son that was really funny. Make sure you at least watch to that part. I do recommend this movie to anyone who likes fresh spins on superhero movies. Hope you liked this review, and please read some of my others. See ya guys!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Terrible Photography,"There are already plenty of comments about the movie itself and Will Smith so I prefer to comment on the cinematography of the movie. The director and the director of photography should be ashamed of themselves. Did anyone else get dizzy or nauseous during the out of focus panning scenes. We were shown things that Hancock was looking at but from our perspective not his. Why were they out of focus? Is the new thought in making movies to see if you can make the audience ill. Yes we had to leave 45 minutes into the movie because my wife was so nauseous she just couldn't continue to watch to film. I was having eye strain from the focus technique also.No, I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie on the big screen. Maybe it will be easier to watch on video.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hancock Better than Expected,"Hancock was worth the money in my book. It was funny, and it had the best surprise mid-plot twist I have seen in awhile. This movie could have been just another mindless comedy if it wasn't for the fact that it has heart. Will Smith's character seem genuinely depressed. Yes, there are plenty of sarcastic one-liners and humorous moments. But Hancock, for all his drunken boorishness, is (shed a tear) lonely.Hancock has super-powers of strength, speed, and resistance to bullets, but he is also a drunken, rude, sweaty mess. And every time he helps someone, he manages to mess things up. Either he costs the citizens thousands in tax dollars for city damages or he insults somebody. And his breath stinks, taboot! Then a soft-hearted guy with a nice suit gets saved by Hancock one day. He witnesses the anger people display afterwords and decides, gee, maybe Hancock needs a face-lift. He's a PR man, and he wants to give Hancock a new image. He brings Hancock home for dinner (it's spaghetti madness night) and exhibits the same attitude towards Hancock as one would a puppy that is destroying your shoes. Can't we keep him, hon? His son loves Hancock immediately, but the wifey seem like she's not impressed. His plan is simple: get Hancock sequestered in prison so that people will miss him. Then, when the cops call, he'll be ready to impress 'em with his ""new attitude."" It's fun, flashy, and a perfect summer film. I have mixed feelings about the ending, but I still enjoyed it.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An Annoying Story Written At The Level of A Ten-Year-Old!,"I expected more from Will Smith. He's a Super Star with a lot of clout! He can pick and choose his projects. He brings in the bucks, which is all Hollywood cares about! Then he has the ability pass up junk, like Hancock!The only reason I did not give this film one-star is that the concept of ""redemption"" is a powerful one. I can even honestly say the first third of Hancock was somewhat entertaining, but it went downhill fast! For lack of a better word, the movie became just plain dull! And it's hard to imagine Will Smith in a boring film!There are so many glaring holes in the story it became distracting! A good story makes sense within the world the writer has created. When there is absolutely no explanation for major events taking place, an intelligent person will get annoyed! In a nutshell, that is the definition of sloppy storytelling! See what happens when Hollywood forces it's writers to go on strike! I bet someone exacted revenge by writing such an erratic and dopey story!Memo to Hollywood: It's not cool to chop-off both of a person's hands in a movie geared for children! Is that supposed to be funny? If you think so, then maybe you need the services of a psychiatrist! And when you do cut off a person's hand and wave it around, it relaxes, it does not remain inflexible.

Hancock  It's better than you think!,"Hancock  It's better than you think! I had my concerns about this movie before grabbing a copy at my local Blockbuster. Friends and critics alike told me to steer clear. But like a moth to a flame, being warned about it just makes me want to see it even more! Having heard that the film had been pared down to fit the ratings for PG-13, I kept feeling that Will Smith and crew should have gone for the R rating anyways. Most of the people going to see it probably feel that way. Will Smith was looking fabu in his hero suit and Charize Therron always keeps me entertained. I enjoyed some of the scenes with Will Smith (Hancock) and some neighborhood kids - that made me chuckle. Goodness knows, I've wasted more time on theatrical duds in my lifetime.

"Good, not great","Will Smith is an amazing actor, he has such charm and charisma on screen that its got to the point where he sells the film rather than the film itself being the attraction.Hancock as a summer blockbuster is a lot of fun. The acting on all parts is strong and the humour is well delivered. Others think that it starts well but ends weak, in my opinion it starts quite weak, but once you understand the characters better and Charlize Theron is introduced to the story it really gets going.The main reason why it wasn't great is because it should have been better, the script could have been stronger and the action is a bit too tongue in cheek.Hancock is a good film that keeps you entertained, however it has a few flaws that make it forgettable and puts it in the ""to rent"" pile.

One of the most tragic examples of wasted potential,"This should have been a good movie. Indeed, it starts out strong. Will Smith is a hilariously rude and belligerent superhero who realizes that his attitude is alienating him from what he wants the most: companionship. How he can redeem himself in the eyes of the public is the real challenge.And that is where this film goes south about halfway through. Unexpected and totally unexplained plot elements and character motivations, confusing mythology, mediocre action sequences, and an unsatisfying conclusion just killed this movie. Not enough time was spent on Hancock's ""rehabilitation"" and too much on story lines which were not worth the sacrifice.As stated earlier, the first half was a delight to sit through but a more focused and thought out script, better editing, and less frenetic direction could have made this more than twice the film it was. Please pick a better script next time, Mr. Smith. I say this cause I care. That also goes for Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Very Good, I Enjoy This Movie vary much.","This movie is very, very funny. How many other heroes do you know that get sued and arrested for all the damage they caused by fighting crime? Hancock does do a lot of damage, sometimes just for the fun. But the biggest difference is that Hancock has a background that is both unique and touching at the same time. Hancock is the superhero, but his friend Ray is heroic in his own way and that adds a style not usually found in movies of this type.This is a very good movie, but very underrated by people. If you want a superhero movie that is not the normal type, you really should see this one. Trust me, you'll love it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Intriguing superhero movie with an interesting twist,"Intriguing superhero story with a novel twist. Stars Will Smith as John Hancock, a derro and a wino who we learn has superpowers but despite this, he seems to have given up on life and is anti-social and even more unloved by the people of Los Angeles, for his careless destruction of property when doing 'good'.After accidentally bumping into Public Relations/marketing makeover wannabe Ray Embrey, played by Jason Bateman, John has the chance to attempt to re-invent himself as a hero the people can actually embrace. Charlize Theron also stars as Mary Embrey, Ray's wife. Charlize looks really beautiful in this movie...sort of like the blonde from ABBA (erm, the girl, obviously). It was only on reading the end credits that I realised that it was Theron...shows how much I know about pop culture!There is fun to be had in Smith's convincing depiction of a down and out superhero. Lots of good action scenes and humour that will appeal to both adults and children-whether through visual comedy or the banter.I like the fact that this movie is self-contained. It has an interesting mystery at its centre: who is John Hancock really and how come he has superpowers? We get answers to these questions, which is pleasing. Now, I mentioned that this movie has a novel twist. That's as far as superhero 'backstories' go. I don't think I've ever come across a superhero with Hancock's background in this kind of genre. When that background is revealed, you can either groan (for it being the kind of stuff you'd expect from the US) or just run with it. I did a bit of both, to tell you the truth. If this backstory interests you, I saw a vampire movie which goes down a similar path. From memory, that movie was ""Dracula 2000"". Saw it on free to air TV a few years back, a premiere, I think. Should say here that I watch and enjoy watching the TV series ""Heroes"" despite finding the nature of their powers idiotic! So, if that TV show doesn't bug you, I don't see why Hancock's story would.There is an unexpected twist in this movie which I enjoyed, though, perhaps, it did have some continuity errors. Won't spoil the surprise for you though, perhaps, it did have some continuity errors.Unlike a lot of movies I give good scores to here, I think this could have repeat viewing value. 74/100. Hopefully there won't be a sequel. Wouldn't be interested in that unless Hancock gets some foes like him, but a bit 'anti'. In other words, it's hard to see a sequel with the same kind of villains being engaging. If the makers of this movie do go down the sequel route, they will hopefully rephrase the origins of Hancock's powers so that it isn't so cringe inducing.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Dreadful,"I hate this movie. This has to be the cheapest excuse ever made for a superhero film. There wasn't anything good about it. I was never a big fan of Will Smith, but...He definitely deserves a better role than the one that he has on this movie. In fact, the whole cast and the viewers deserved something better.This is one of the worst movies that I've ever saw, along with ""Alone in the Dark"" and ""The Game Plan"". It was directed by Peter Berg (The director of ""Friday Night Lights"") and this is, by far, his worst movie. It was horrible, completely unwatchable.Like I said before, I hate this film. With passion. I know it is strange, but this could be easily the worst movie ever made: The plot was lame, the characters were annoying and irritating, the especial effects were poor...Everything about this film was terrible.""Hancock"" sucked and it was a complete waste of time.

My Favorite Original Super Hero Films,"A fun superhero movie with serious Michael Bay vibes, Hancock is a great Will Smith performance and a great example of the superhero sub-genre.Peter Berg is a pretty great director, I think. The man knows how to do action. He proved this dramatically with the deliriously OTT The Rundown, which was lots of fun. He channels Michael Bay here, with the signature saturated look and big explosions and appetite for destruction.Will Smith is as good as ever, and Jason Bateman is good as a straight man, though I've seen him in funnier roles. Charlize Theron is great too.The action scenes are great. The opening freeway scene, the bank scene, the city fight scene, and the hospital fight were all great and very well done. The prison scene is great too, and funny. The violence here is surprisingly brutal and graphic for a PG-13 superhero film, and apparently it had to be cut a few times to obtain a PG-13.It's a pretty entertaining movie, especially since it's an original superhero flick and not a comic book or video game adaptation. I marginally recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Different Superhero Movie (6.2),"It's a beautiful and different superhero movie better than some Marvel and DC movies at least different and interesting from them.It was uncomfortable not to see the background of the main characters too much.

Enter Jason Bateman, a PR manager who tries to turn Hancock's life around by inspiring him to become a hero everyone loves.That's where the movie stops being fun and the scripts just shoves plot twists at you to keep you interested. The angle about ""human"" follies of superheroes is completely wasted by an overly simplistic script.What really is a let down are the performances.

What is with the closeups?,"I'm glad somebody else finally mentioned it because I thought I was the only one noticing this.Is it me, or is 90% of the movie consisting of extreme closeups of the actors? And when I mean closeups I mean CLOSEUPS, to the point that only their eyes and nose and part of their mouths appear. It became very annoying. I thought it was just something that would go away after the very first closeup of Hancock, but no it just continued on and on and on.Lots of other things wrong with this movie. The jokes fell flat (especially with that whole a$$hole thing, a clear ripoff of Back to the future), the action was weak (other than the brief two-minute fight between Hancock and another individual), and the movie constantly felt as if it was being pulled in too many directions. It couldn't decide whether it was a drama, a comedy, a science fiction movie, etc. Basically what you saw in the trailer were all the ""momentous"" moments of the movie, everything else was just boring filler material.The only reason this gets a 3 is because as always Will Smith looks like he put in as much effort as possible into making this something. I've got to give credit where credit is due and say that Will always looks like he gives 110% to any project, and this was no exception.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I've never read/seen the comic that this was born from but I wholeheartedly applaud the transition.Smith is great, the script is funny, and the effects are top notch.I for one didn't like the trailers and as a result expected the movie to suck,but in actual fact it's far more ""adult"" that you would expect and delivers a lot of laughs.I highly recommend Hancock and so do (I assume) the 300 or so other people who were laughing their asses off in the theatre.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A good movie if you don't mind the ending.,"I love the idea of having a superhero going through a normal life. The movie starts out great, portraying a realistic view on the characters. I really like Will Smith's acting and despite the criticism, I don't personally find the CGI that bad.Unfortunately, the movie loses its charm around half way through the movie when the plot gets overly complicated between the main characters. Oh and also, plot holes. There are lots of them in the second half of the movie. They might not drive you crazy like how they did to me but personally, the movie felt really rushed as details are left out.Overall, it's a good movie to watch on your free time but definitely not a blockbuster.

Unfortunately it passed right over my radar all the years since I didn't even know it was about Superhero-like powers etc. when I saw the title and the cover (just Will Smith with a beanie on and glasses).

Hancock is a surprisingly good film,"After seeing the reviews I didn't expect much from the film. But I was pleasantly surprised. The film starts off well with some silly action. I think people wanted to see an out and out comedy which lots of action. But the film tries to be more intelligent than that which some people might feel is boring. I could never see the film doing anything other than ending up as a hero flick and it fill that right to do that to me.Will smith is good as Hancock, with the supporting cast Charlize Theron and Jason Bateman filling there roles admirably. The special effects are a mixed bag with some good stuff, the flying effects when Hancock are drunk do look very computer generated. The editing is OK, pretty standard fair as is the directing.Overall quite a good film which wasn't what I was expecting.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Good, solid and funny film but tries to be too many things at once.","Hancock is an interesting film, this much has to be said.The concept of taking a Superman style hero, powers and all and making him a low life, bungling alcoholic has to be one of the most original ever to cross a studio executive's desk.The film scores well on so many points but you just feel that something was missed.Hancock drifts between superhero movie, comedy and drama and thus spreads itself a little too thin to be good at any. The comedy is stunted by the all too serious tones and the lack of any real villain is a major downside because what it gets right and what we are treated to most of is the superhero side and no baddie equals why bother?Bad points aside though this is a good film. The special effects are top notch and we are treated to some great flying effects and fight scenes. The humour is snappy and spot on with some great delivery by Smith although it is just a bit too sparce and I feel more could have been put in to the script without the danger of it becoming comedy farce.I can see what the director is trying to do with the drama and it works with the subject matter but to tackle such deep psychological subjects of a superhero you really need something epic and fleshed out and as stated before, it's too much of a lot of things at once and never gets to a climax with any of them.A special mention has to go to the soundtrack. The selection of moody down and out blues mixed with some well placed funk and rap songs at appropriate moments really lifts the character and emphasises the fact that this is a much needed black superhero in a world of lilly white comic book crimefighters.Hancock is worth checking out, indeed if like me you are a fan of such superheros (Personally I like any film where someone has the ability to fly) but the film does seem to blow it's load in the first half an hour and descends into more grim territory later on.It would certainly be worthy of a more fleshed out sequel because when an idea is this good it would be a shame to let it die!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Positive Aspects? Didn't expect that...,"John Hancock is a film which I just watched via DVD. I had not seen this in theaters because it didn't look like a movie for me. After watching the movie, I was taken by surprise a bit. I expected this awful drawn out corny plotted film. Although the plot can be considered to be a bit ""corny"" I think it almost helps the movie. I gave this movie a 7 out of 10. So I'm thinking that's like an average score, maybe a C in a class? It held my attention, made me laugh a few times, gave me those great 1 liners that you can't get out of your head for 2 days after. But it also had a somewhat nice ending, throughout the movie you start to predict what will happen, but the nice thing is, it almost gives you several options as to ""what could happen."" I think that's a huge positive aspect in this movie. So would I recommend the movie? If you're at the video store, or on your Netflix account, can't seem to figure out what you want to see next, give it a try. It's only like 90 minutes, and I don't think you'll walk away thinking it was a waste of 90 minutes.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

a mediocre summer blockbuster,"Will Smith stars in a comedy super hero action movie as John Hancock a not so stereotypical superhero. Hancock is a gifted middle aged man who has been disowned by the public because of the destruction he creates when trying to do something right, costing the city millions. Then Hancock runs in to Jason Batemans character (Ray) who wants to try and change the public's impression of him. Everything seems to be going all right until Hancock meets a woman who has super powers like him and is the key to unlocking what happened in his past.The story is not well thought out and feels that it has been written in a very short amount of time. I think the writers found it hard keeping the idea of a non-stereotypical super hero and because of this the film is only 92 minutes. By the end of the film the story falls flat and so they fill the end up with CGI fight scenes which are actually well-made and quite convincing. To make the story better I think they should have developed Charilze Theron character more. One other problem I found with the story is there is no well fleshed out villain in the story which can leave the audience a bit confused.""Hancock"" is directed by actor/director Peter Berg who has directed films such as ""Welcome to the Jungle"" and ""The Kingdom."" Peter Berg uses a big variety of camera angles that work well with the shot situation. During the whole the film the only shot transition used is fade; I think the editor does this to create effect. He does this because he doesn't want the movie to come across too fun and silly he wants to show the audience that the film is also serious.In ""Hancock"" all the original music composed is by one man John Powell which has produces music in films such as ""Shrek"" and the ""Bourne series"". The original music in this film works well and effectively throughout the film. It helps to show the audience what the film is all about and what the main theme is. The movie also contains songs from different artists the majority of them are RnB songs which reflect Will Smiths character (Hancock) and shows the tone of the movie. Some examples of these songs are ""move"" by Ludicrous and ""colours"" by Ice T.The film is backed up by an all star cast which includes ""I Am legend's"" Will Smith, Charlize Theron and Jason Bateman they all give good performances. Jason Bateman, who is the character that connects Smith and Theron characters together, is great as usual and likable. Will Smith performance is as good as ever, he nails the drunken superhero very well whilst delivering some funny comedic lines. Particular good scenes for Will Smith is near the end were Hancock becomes all emotional because he remembers what happened in his past. During this scene Will Smith gives his best performance during the whole movie.Even though ""Hancock"" has a rating of 12A I wouldn't recommend this film for children under the age of 12 because it contains some bad language and violent scenes which could scare some children. I think this movie will appeal to teenagers and young adults the most because they would enjoy the type of comedy in this film and the great action and fight scenes. Older adults may enjoy this two but I feel that adults were not the intended viewer and I don't think that some of the comedy will appeal to them.All in all ""Hancock"" is an average film; it's not an amazing nor awful. It is a film that I feel doesn't live up to the good story premise although It was an interesting look at a super hero movie compared with all the ""Supermans"" and ""Batmans"" we are given today, in a sense it is more realistic. I like the way that you can see what life is actually like as a superhero. This movie contains many funny moments, good acting and outstanding special effects. I think that this film would be worth renting but i don't think it's worth seeing at the cinema; it's nothing to rush out to see unless you're a die-hard Will Smith fan.I give this film 2.5/5 stars.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A different take on the superhero genre,"I quite like this movie. It's not perfect by any means but it has a solid message in it. A superhero who doesn't remember his past and who hasn't really had anyone in his life is just kind of drifting along. You don't get the typical ""good guy"" in this superhero though. This one has lots of flaws. I guess this is why it's so relatable to me. Being all-powerful doesn't mean that you don't have a heart also. Hancock himself doesn't know why he's on Earth or what he's supposed to do. He does help people but he doesn't know how to help himself.This ends up making him an outcast and someone who doesn't get along with others. He wants to have meaning but he just can't find it. He instead lets himself slip into bad habits because he has never really had anyone that legitimately cared for him. Until he meets someone one day who actually cares. You see a very broken man who has never had a reason to look inward, start to examine himself for once. The shift that Hancock goes through is realistic and creates a very sympathetic character. This movie offers a lot more than a standard ""hero saves the day"" story and I think it's a worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Standard feelgood end treacle makes it a less good than it might have been.,"Why does Hollywood always insist on a happy ending? Why? Yes, I know the bottom line is bucks and nothing but bucks, but doesn't someone in Tinseltown have the wit to make a movie which will keep the cash tills rolling and, for once, still avoid the buckets of treacly sentimentality which Hollywood has made its own? Someone, somewhere please! Hancock is a very good case in point. It is not your usual run of the mill film, it has several nice twists, there is a certain originality in the story and it seems set to break the mould and end on a downbeat, although not one which would be too downbeat. But no, we can't have that, can we. The Western World wants to believe in the Tooth Fairy and sundry notions that it will all come good in the end, so Hancock, too, is obliged to go down the road of slushy sentimentality and end up on a cheery note, so that the punters can 'feel good'. Perhaps there's something wrong with me that my heart actually sinks when everything ends up white picket fences and fresh apple pie. The irony is that Hancock has a good story to tell and at its centre is something of an enigma. The special effects are also something else, and although everyone and his dog now knows that the magic is nothing but several hundred special effects artists spending several months behind their Apple Macs, there's is still that wow factor. How do they do it, how do they have superhero Hancock smash into buildings and take huge chunks out of the masonry? Computers, of course. Yeah, right — but how? Look elsewhere for a synopsis of Hancock. It always seems rather daft to spend most of these reviews retelling what happened. Will Smith is, as always, Will Smith and I have always liked Will Smith, ever since his Fresh Prince days. It would be good to see him stretch himself a little with some character acting but . . . Charlize Theron deserves a great deal of credit for allowing several close-ups to be used which show her skin is less than perfect, but she is, after all, of Afrikaner stock and such people are at tad more down to earth than your average nubile Mid-West wannabe. Don't let me put you off this film (especially, of course, if you are in the majority and are something of a sucker for sentimental, schlocky closure) but all I can say is that I have a niggling suspicion the Hancock, in other hands, produced in another culture could have been a far better film. As it is it gets 6/7 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Smith slumps in superhero summer,"Alcoholic superhero Hancock (Smith) is offered a chance to redeem himself by an up and coming businessman, whose wife has a secret.Superhero summer of 2008 was won by The Dark Knight, no question. In and amongst the Batmans, the Ironmans and the Hulks was a film made for profitability and to maintain the likable Smith summer Blockbuster saga, a film that is harmless fun and a film that tries but doesn't succeed in preaching. Hancock is bubblegum entertainment with that extra zest and surprise to make it likable.Starting with the positives that multi million smash has a great selection of a cast that add the drama and point to the plot. Charlize Thereon adds a necessity to the romantic side with an unexpected twist and turn performance with a juicy underlining secret and vibe that every scene with her in gives the plot a much needed boost. Jason Bateman is sharp enough for the stereotyped content husband and ambitious but not determined enough convention guy. The business idea is actually laughable.The big positive is that this film is told and shot with entertainment intention and baring in mind it is an action fantasy you don't want to take it too seriously. There is plenty of moments to enjoy including a whale in the sea, a mid air superhero fight and one of the most awful attempts at bank robbery you will ever see on screen.To the negatives and with a heavy weight on my shoulders with this terrible burden, it has to be the central star. From the Fresh Prince to Independence Day Will Smith has brought us effortless comedy and zest with a new approach to humour styling, so where is it here? The grumpy voice, the slumped shoulders the effortless attempt to be funny.And the repetition is dreadful, with the key example at the ""good job"" moments. And whilst this isn't labelled as a comedy there are moments when it should be funny for Big Will. This effortless portrayal at a superhero makes me sad as from a young age I grew up watching his films, and it does sicken me to write this.Before all the blame gets shunted on the star it is significant to recall that he isn't a scriptwriter, so a large portion must be down to the plot. From flying through the air to a reinvented Superman theme to one of the world's worst reasons for superpowers the scripting is as dizzy as Hancock in the morning. It is never grounded, there are too many clauses and rules and regulations. Why can't it be as simple as get bitten and now you're a spider? This whole background base of Hancock whilst initially intriguing finds itself lost in clauses too deep to claw its way back, with an unbelievably cheesy ending.The alcoholism isn't as serious as it should be but as before this is built for enjoyment and Peter Berg blends action and fantasy well enough with some well directed fights and whilst Smith and the plot could be better, this is still reasonable fun.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It's Like Two Movies Have Been Condensed In To One.,"Continuing my plan to watch every Will Smit movie in order, I come to Hancock (2008)I watched the unrated version.The year the MCU started, also saw Will Smith trying his hand at a superhero movie. Hancock is two movies. The first movie is about an anti hero learning to become superhero, and is by far the better of the two. The second movie is more of an origin story, as we learn more about Hancock's past and he finds out he is not alone. Both parts could have worked well as as stand alone movies, but put together its muffled and uneven.The movie shows all the signs of studio interference and never establishes a clear tone. Hancock only works because of Will Smith, whose performance is stronger than what the movie deserves. Don't get me wrong; I don't hate it, it is sometimes funny, sometimes clever, and occasionally enjoyable. Especially the first 50 minutes.Charline Theron is ok, as is Jason Bateman (who basically just plays the same guy he always plays) One of the problems is the lack of any real villain. Red Parker is just a weasel with a gun and is no real threat.Hancock grossed $227 million at the domestic box office to end 2008 the 4th highest grossing movie of the year. Smith highest performing movie since Men In Black.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Below average flick with big stars,"This is probably the disappointment of the year so far. I'm a fan of Will Smith and an even bigger one of Charlize Theron, but still this movie seemed like a waste of money and time. The key weakness is the script - it goes nowhere - and its hard to tell whether this movie wants to be a comedy or a drama. It's as if the 2 halves were written by completely different people. The acting is decent though, including Jason Bateman. But there is not much character development and substance in the roles. The effects are good, and it has a few laughs - almost all are shown in the trailers.. But i was left a bit ""Huh?"" when the movie ended.Its just a pointless film. It will draw crowds only out of curiosity and the stars in it.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A Tale of Love, Loss, Letting Go, and Really Good Acting","When I walked in the threature to see Hancock I went in picturing a down and out superhero who ends up having an affair with the wife of the man who is trying to save his public image. Boy was I wrong in a lot of ways but right in some of the others. I won't tell any spoilers but the acting in this movie is incredible. The bond between Mary and Hancock is visible through everything they do and the way they look at each other you could see the feelings the exist between them. And the sacrifice at the end of the movie almost made me cry as he leaves the hospital at the climax at the movie. THe emotional connection it provides as well as the great story, characters and amazing special effects make this one summer movie worth seeing.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hancock is good but not great,"Hancock to me was good but not great. The story was okay, but Will Smith really steals the show in this one. The only reason I thought it was okay is because the story had no real villain, and to me, it kind of felt like a kid movie. Not much like most of Will Smiths movies which are made for people who can understand it. When I went to the theater to see Hancock, I have a good experience because I went with some friends and that kept me in my seat but I was not into the movie. One thing I can say is that the movie is hilarious and well presented, which surprised me because it looked like it did not have much potential. I recommend that you see it but don't get to excited about it, seeing as once again, it is good not great.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Will Smith is an incredible actor and the story has some real flesh to it.The twist comes, and it all starts going downhill. No longer is there any real drama or tension, it's all Hollywood goop with no substance and bing bang boom plot devices that don't go together but make an okay summer blockbuster.It's sad because they build you up at the start for a fall by the end.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Excellent but misunderstood.,"The people who give this a poor rating are those who went in looking for a superhero movie. On the surface, that's what this appears to be, but as the story progresses it becomes apparent that the heroism is secondary to the story and it's actually a love story. I'm not here to spoil the movie for anyone, but many will understand the concept of two people who seem destined for one another, but when together, they're weaker than when they're apart, leaving them one option - show their love by distancing themselves. This is why there's been no sequel - the story has been told.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Falling Short Of Heroic,"What would you call someone who is bad-mannered, foul-mouthed, destructive, homophobic, unreasonable, and drunken who is a liar and an asshole? Probably not a superhero. Will Smith plays Hancock, a slacker with all those attributes who also has supernatural powers. Maybe you could call him a superzero--someone with the potential to be spectacular who falls far short.He's a reluctant hero for sure, who usually rises above his crassness only when forced to, and then leaves careless destruction in the wake of his heroics.He meets Ray (Jason Bateman), an optimistic PR man who thinks Hancock should change his image. Ray's wife, Mary (Charlize Theron), seems unconvinced.What follows is an unpredictable story about love and possible redemption. There are bad guys, of course, who complicate matters, but the resolution of this story feels messy and contrived. By the end of the film, viewers may feel like it was all just an origin story that served no purpose except to be the foundation for other real stories to follow. But who would want to emotionally invest in a hero that still feels less than realized, a temporary patchwork of questionable values?One feels that an opportunity has been missed. Imperfect heroes can be quite interesting if their story makes them lovable or compelling. Hancock strains to achieve either.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
good potential good action no suspense,"John Hancock (Will Smith) is a drunk mess of a superhero. He destroys as much as he saves. The LA public has turned against him. He saves PR expert Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) and Ray is determined to return the favor by saving Hancock's image. Ray brings Hancock back home for dinner but Ray's wife Mary (Charlize Theron) isn't happy to have Hancock around.On the surface, this is a great premise. It has good comedic potential. It would work better if he was a klutz instead of an alcoholic. Hancock is just too unlikeable. And the last half of the movie leaves me confused with more questions than answers. Was there even a climax? That one handed fool can't be the criminal mastermind that is his nemesis. Is there a nemesis?Director Peter Berg has now become an expert on action scenes. I have no doubt about his action directing. But he needs to think about what the story should be. Who the heck is Hancock? I can't really answer that properly after watching it twice. The movie clunks along without much suspense or tension. Every once in awhile there's an action scene.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Very unique superhero movie, wish more were like it","Hancock is the story of a man who is a superhero physically but human mentally. This isn't like most superhero movies, there isn't a ton of action, there is no supervillain, and the the protagonist isn't perfect. The protagonist deals with alcoholism, clumsiness, is disrespectful, and has anger management issues for most of this film. The film centers around Hancock's public image. The city residents of LA hate Hancock for the damage caused by his actions even though he saves many people. The difficulties faced by the protagonist are what many could imagine would be the difficulties of a real life superhero rather than a comic book hero. Because of this, despite the story being about a man with super-powers. The story still feels very realistic and relatable to the audience. Many have complained about the plot twist (no spoilers) and said that it disrupted the plot too much. I don't really agree with that though as I found the plot twist to still be remaining in the context. It certainly changes some things but I didn't get the feeling that the movie was ruined because of it. If however, you don't like a movie with a lot of grey morality characters, this movie is not for you since that's basically what the whole plot line is about. If you do however, then this movie is perfect and you will love it. I would definitely recommend this movie to anybody who asked me.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Enjoyable Antisuperhero Movie,"I enjoyed the fact that Hancock is an anti-superhero, with a severe personality disorder, and a drinking problem. I would have liked to have seen Jason Batemen's character have been a bit more outgoing, as he is eventually overshadowed by Smith and Theron. However, the threesome's interaction is pretty good.This movie was far more dramatic than My Super Ex Girlfriend, which has comparable plot elements, but still has some funny moments. The ending of the movie seemed rushed, perhaps because there was not a strong establishment of a villain throughout. In fact, the movie starts out with Hancock being his own worst enemy, but towards the end, his own inner battle is forgotten, overshadowed, or replaced by an outer battle with foes.Ultimately, this is fun for a while, then gets mired down in drama. The ending is somewhat satisfying, and somewhat unsatisfying. Not so disappointing that it is not worth renting.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An entertaining summer flick....and nothing more,"I am most definitely a Will Smith fan seeing as the movies he has been in, on average, tend to be of high quality. So when I went to see Hancock, I was hoping for a decent film starring Will Smith. And that is exactly what I got: A somewhat confused film that wasn't great, but not bad at the same time.Hancock starts out with the statement that it is unlike most traditional superhero films out there, and in my opinion, this was a great decision by the filmmakers. Superhero films are all the rage nowadays, but having a film starring a super-powered alcoholic is a comedic twist and makes it somewhat original. The storyline after the first 20 minutes or so becomes incredibly generic and mindless though, which really ruins the movie. Considering the beginning looked incredibly promising due to how it was original, I was disappointed to see the filmmakers take the generic and easy road that as been walked down way too many times in the past. Not to mention how the ending was absolutely terrible, and I almost cried at how shallow and lame it was.The acting was very good though, and Will Smith showed that he is still at the top of his game. I was unaware of Jason Bateman (Arrested Development, Juno) being in the film, so it was a very nice surprise on top of the fact that he did an excellent job in his role.If you have seen a superhero film in the last five years or so, you will be aware that they are computer-generated extravaganzas, and Hancock is no exception. While many scenes look incredibly realistic and authentic, many scenes look absolutely horrible, and Will Smith flying in front of a green screen was not cutting it for me. By now, I am really getting tired of these CGI fests, and while Hancock boils down to just all computers with some acting, it was done decently.The camera-work is another thing in which I am not sure whether or not the film did right. Instead of having professional camera angles and smooth scenes, Hancock goes for the raw approach in which the cameras are incredibly shaky to try and immerse the viewer into the scene. It's really a matter of opinion on which way viewers like best, and although I am not always a fan of this camera style, it got the job done.The main problem with the film is just what the hell the producers wanted it to be. It basically seems like an incoherent mash of comedy, action, romance, fantasy and superhero all mashed into one. It seemed like the filmmakers were trying to appeal to as many audiences as possible, which turned out to be a mistake seeing as they just had too much on their plates. I was happy to see that the film did not rely on its comedy to propel itself, due to how most comedies rely solely on the jokes tend to fall flat on their faces by the end. As for the comedy found within the movie, the jokes were really a mixed bag. Some were hilarious, while the on-going joke of ""Call me an a-hole....."" really wasn't funny after the second time, which was a problem considering it popped up many times throughout the film.Was Hancock an amazing film? Absolutely not. Was Hancock a decent summer flick? Indeed it is. As long as you go into the theater with low expectations, I think it is an entertaining ride throughout. Yes, it does have quite a lot of problems such as genre confusion and some fake-looking CGI, but for someone who just wants a fun movie with no real purpose or meaning, Hancock should be sufficient.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hancock,"If we're being honest, Hancock didn't pack much weight at all. Will Smith is the reason why this film didn't completely flop.From the start, I caught the notion that everyone behind the camera just didn't really care all that much; They basically let Will Smith, be Will Smith, and just carry the film with his stature. The narrative on it's own was a big issue. It had such a choppy pace and flow, being super fast paced, with little - to - no setup.The script by Vincent Ngo & Vince Gilligan was pretty funny, but lacked wit, and powerful dialogue scenes. If this film was more of Will Smith cracking tongue and cheek jokes, and fighting bad guys, it probably would've been better, being a harmless action/comedy. Jason Bateman & Charlize Theron did their best to compliment Smith, but the character developments they tried to display during the second act, wasn't all that good, or necessary. Theron was just a plot device until the third act, with her character becoming short lived. I was fond of Jae Head's performance, for what little meaning he had. For his first motion picture, he does very well, and seems to be a favorable young actor on the rise.The effects and action sequences were done pretty amateurishly, feeling too cartoonish, and sloppy. The didn't really showcase anything new, or eye catching, being the film's biggest disappointment.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The main problem is that it turns into a completely different film halfway through and squanders its premise.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An oddly enough ride.,"Hancock is enjoyable, but has three little drawbacks: Will Smith, the clumsy usage of visual effects and (how not so?) the script .Although Will Smith has proved that he can act like an actual actor (see the heart-warming The Pursuit of Happiness), most of the films he gets involved in are just commercial blockbusters, with all their negative connotations (his first actual big-screen hit, Independence Day, may have set the tone...). And if he can get involved in the production (and he does again in Hancock) and show off a bit, better still. Show off chest muscles, or backside, or simply poses... You can tell he likes that. He shows off less minutes than in previous films, but he shows off. Just like in I, robot, or I am legend. Still, there's something about Will Smith's presence that stops you from hating him so much despite all this. Odd. Whether this is charisma or not, or whether this film should have been called ""I am Hancock"" is obviously not the purpose of these lines.All the visual effects from the trailer and used as bait seem to happen rather soon in the film. Which is good, since they aren't anything special or unseen before. After that, for a moment, it seems the story will acquire deeply human overtones and leave effect in the background... but then the film takes an unfortunate and inexplicable path and we come back to visual effects ad infinitum. No surprises here.But we also come back to a much darker atmosphere that changes the style of the film and that (again) seems to be uncalled for. There is a similar confusion with the genre itself: comedy, more dramatic at times, ""adventure"" parts, ... The surprising and unconventional approach probably comes from the intention of making a different superhero film. In practice, however, the producers truly seem indecisive about this, and so ended up creating a strange hybrid creature.All the above, plus the fact that the relationship between characters is awkward and twisted results in, yes, an entertaining film, but one that doesn't make the most of itself or even reach the end of the story looking like it's the end of the story. If you are reading this in disbelief, go and watch it: the cleaners may have to kick you out, because you won't believe the film is over. As spectators, we are entitled to a fulfilling experience. And if a script doesn't give us this ultimate experience, then we feel emptiness in our film goer hearts. Subconsciously, we ask for more and we can't help cursing the experience.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Hancock is a mixed bag with an interesting premise.,"Hancock is a mixed bag with an interesting premise. It was released back in 2008, during the whole superhero resurgence with films such as Iron Man and The Dark Knight that were both well received both commercially and financially. Of course, now in 2017 superhero movies are pretty much a cottage industry, with some feeling there's an over-saturation, but that's neither here or there. Hancock is about an alcoholic superhero with a big PR problem. He's rude, crass, and he's an alcoholic, and it goes without saying the public doesn't like him.Hancock saves Ray, a PR agent and after that, the movie takes off. Ray wants to repackage him as a better superhero and they develop a friendship of sorts as the movie goes along. Hancock's first act is rather brilliant, it plays almost like a David Chappelle skit with Hancock involved in all kinds of crazy shenanigans. Alas, the movie kind of falls apart under the weight of its own mythology in the second act. There are some interesting things at play with the mythology but the tones from the first two acts never feel organic, it almost felt like it was trying to be two different films. The first act felt like a satire on the superhero genre and the second act felt like a darker superhero film. Anyway I digress, the third act is rather underwhelming with a cookie cutter villain who has no presence whatsoever, it almost felt like they needed to throw in a villain just to wrap the film up . However, that's not to say that the film doesn't have any positives. Will Smith is great as Hancock, he gives the character gravitas underneath all his smugness. Hancock starts out as a rather unlikable character but as the story goes on they do a good job of humanizing him. Jason Bateman is great as Ray, and Charlize Theron is great as Ray's wife, Mary. To give anything else away would spoil the film. I guess this movie is worth a rental if you haven't seen it already. By the way, for you Breaking Bad fans out there, the script to Hancock was co-written by Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan. So I guess it's kind of cool to see his earlier work from back in the day. Hancock had its moments, but overall it's a mixed bag both as a comedy and a superhero film.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Metal Light Shade of Death,"If ever there was a movie we wanted to love only to watch it crash and burn, Hancock may be it. Smith, Theron, Bateman all together in a superhero movie about someone with Superman-esque powers who happens to be a degenerate drunk in need of an image makeover? That sounds so cool! Seeing Smith break away from his normal nice guy thing to play a real skeeze, also really cool.Then the second half of this movie happens. It's just such a 180 from the beginning, it's jarring in the worst possible way and makes it feel like the studio was pitched two ideas and rather than making both movies they just mashed them into one mess. I either want drunken, rehabilitating Hancock or I want epic battle of the gods. They clearly can't manage both.Solid background flick but beyond that I can't recommend this. Weirdly, I would say it's worth checking out some clips of it on youtube because there are a few really fun scenes, it just doesn't know how to do a whole movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Hancoock will be cold-cocked by audiences,"HancockDuring the first 45 minutes of this movie, I was constantly pinching myself hoping to wake up from the nightmare i was being subjected too--unfortunately, this was not a nightmare--I was witnessing the talents of Wil smith, Jason Bateman, Charlize Theron, Director Peter Berg (who is responsible for the second best show on TV-Friday Night Lights) and writer Michael Mann (Heat, Miami Vice)--how could all this talent be responsible for such an abomination of film-making. A sloppy narrative, uneven directing, lethargic writing, and unlikeable central character--the movie had me clamoring for the exit.However, in the second half, when the audience learns something about another character (hint Bateman or Theron might have a secret-wont tell you which one)--the movie shifts into actual watchability--in fact--if the revelation in the second act would have been the central focus of thefilm from the start-it may have been a better movie. I was frustrated because Bateman (who is always first-rate)and Theron (who can be hot or cold--but is definitely warmer than usual in this movie) are the real strengths of the film. Smith's character becomes likable in the last 30 minutes but it was a little too late. The film is filled with about 342 ideas-some good and some bad, most of them not followed through. The second half had the makings of a decent popcorn flick but was weigheddown by its convoluted plotting and misdirection. The last scene involving something that Will Smith does with the moon belongs in a romantic comedy like Sleepless in Seatlle and not in a summer action flick---its an extremely cheesy moment! I think the movie my draw the Wil Smith fans in the first few days, but in the end, Hancock will be cold cocked by its failings.

"A Fun and Humorous Movie that is Jam Packed with Flaws,","Hancock is a decent movie with a well written storyline and an impressive cast. It's certainly a fun action movie that has a lot of very funny parts, as well as a terrific performance from Will Smith, who takes on a role nothing like what he has done previously. It's an enjoyable movie, but it has many, many flaws, the biggest one is that the main character is not very likable for the majority of the movie, I know it's on purpose for the most part, but seeing him throw a kid up in to the sky and flinging a whale in to a boat was way too much and it wasn't necessary if you want us to support this character. Also the movies main villains don't show up until about fifty minutes in and don't start doing anything until about the last twenty, which is a significant problem, especially for a superhero movie, where a villain is one of the most important parts. There are several other problems, the cheesy effects, the anti-climactic ending, the lame twist, the lack of comedy from Jason Bateman's character, this movie easily could have been an 8, but because of all these major mistakes, I had to go down to 6. It's nowhere near perfect, but Hancock is still quite enjoyable and it might make for a good watch if you ever see it on television and have some time to kill.After a down on his luck superhero named Hancock saves a man's life, this man feels he owes it to him to make Hancock in to the real superhero he should be.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fun but lost itself,"Hancock (Will Smith) is a superhero, but not your usual hero. We first meet Hancock passed out on a city bench being prodded by a kid to wake up and help the cops. Hancock wakes up, slaps a passing girl on the rear and grabs a bottle of whiskey before flying off to help the police.This gives us a great introduction to this movie showing us what is in-store for us. Hancocks attempts at helping out the people of LA end up causing major damage due to Hancocks lack of tact and his supposed selfish motivations. As expected Hancock is hated by the city officials and most citizens because of his reckless actions. Eventually Hancock saves the life of Ray Embery (Jason Bateman) a PR man trying to use his skills to change the world and failing at it. Ray sees in Hancock a lonely person desiring to do what he thinks is right but finding hate instead of appreciation for his actions. To help Hancock turn public opinion Ray begins to guide Hancock in how to be a better hero.This is a really creative film. It takes the hero film fad out there shows us what it could really look like in our world. The best part is every character is well done with one exception. Will Smith shows us a hero who is just like you and me hiding his confusion and hurt behind his actions and attitude. Bateman is a fun counter to Smith being honest about the stupidity of Hancock in a real caring way. The only person I felt was weak as a character was Charlize Theron as Mary Embery, Rays wife and a mystery for Hancock. I don't know if Theron can really be blamed for her character seeming off however.In the story we get a great setup for seeing a cool growth in Hancock. Theron's character Mary kind of ruins that for us. We learn of a mystery to Hancocks origin and when all is revealed it cheapens a lot of the creative story telling done so far. Mary just doesn't fit into the story that was being created and it feels forced to create the drama around her, Hancock, and Ray that the movie makers obviously want.While this is a major issue with the film it doesn't totally destroy it. The film is fun, witty, and has good action. Even with a big bump in the story Hancock is still a good film and makes some cool insights into the superhero type story.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A second-rate superhero movie,"""Hancock"" is yet another entry in the flood of superhero movies that have hit the big screen in recent years. Here, a superhero with questionable methods falls out of favour with the public and enlists the help of a PR professional to repair his image.This is an interesting premise, though hardly original (""The Incredibles"" comes to mind, for one). However, apparently this premise didn't provide quite enough material for an entire film so the film-makers decided to tack on another equally slight storyline. As a result, the film feels like two different films, neither of which is especially compelling.The cast is pretty decent, though. Will Smith is perhaps Hollywood's most bankable star and while this performance certainly isn't among his most memorable it is ably handled. Charlize Theron turns in a pretty good performance as well while Jason Bateman plays the same sort of character that he always plays.Peter Berg's direction isn't bad though I'm not a fan of his style, which blends a gritty look with lots of jittery camera-work (see ""The Kingdom"" for a more pronounced example). The special effects are good enough but certainly nothing to write home about. Score & soundtrack are average and pretty forgettable.In the end, the movie is somewhat entertaining but the script could have definitely used some work. I'd rather have one fully fleshed out story than two thin stories any day. With this shortcoming, the movie is unlikely to appeal to many outside of the target audience.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Did you shove a man's head up another man's ass?,"OK, the concept is funny. A ""super hero"" that is nothing but a lush and causes so much damage that the mayor wants him to leave; ""Go to New York."" I only tuned in to see Charlize Theron. I'd watch her in anything; even a PG-13 film designed to appeal to People's and Teen Choice audiences.Jason Bateman is a loser PR agent that is going to re-create Hancock and make him as lovable as Superman.Bateman doesn't know about his wife (Theron). Hancock finds out from her about his past.Some exciting action, but you would be better off with Eddie Murphy in Beverly Hills Cop.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"I have to under grade this, It cheats on so many levels it's disgusting","I like Will Smith, he can act like the best of them. but what does he do? He plays superheros and futuristic cops or lonely scientists in doomsday worlds. If it weren't for The Pursuit of Happiness, I would say his career is going downwards.The film itself is a cheat. It has trailers and ads about Will Smith being some sort of disgruntled super hero with a horrible attitude, while some funny looking PR guy is going to great lengths to ""fix"" him. Not so in the movie! The whole convincing takes about 5 minutes of film!Then there is Charlize Theron. I mean, OK, it wasn't a role unfit for her, but it felt like the only reason she was in the cast to begin with is some weird ""let's see Smith kiss Theron"" thing.And then there is the actual plot. Jeez, what an underachievement. It actually had some very good ideas and they were unexploited, abused and thrashed, giving way to silly special effects and silly dialogs.Bottom line: for presenting itself as an original movie, with a true anti-hero as lead character, and for hiding the real ""jist"" of the story in the commercials, I give it a big BOOOOO! Watch it on TV when it comes out!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Is it a bird?  Is it a plane?  Nope.  It's sozzled superhero Hancock,"*** This review is courtesy of Fundulgence.com - the One to watch. It also featured on BBC Radio Sheffield, Leeds and York. ***John Hancock (Will Smith) is not your usual superhero. He's an alcoholic, self centred, socially inept, washed-up wino. His bungled attempts at super-heroics, crater-making landing zones and mass vandalism in the line of duty cause more costly damage than the criminals and natural disasters he's sworn to stop. When Hancock rescues a PR executive (played by Juno's Jason Bateman), from certain death, he's offered the opportunity to redeem himself. In complete contrast to the low-life representation that advertising types generally get in the majority of Hollywood movies, Bateman's Ray Emery is the most morally upright, ethically upstanding and commendable PR man committed to celluloid. He offers to re-brand Hancock, making him the respectable, wholesome hero that he clearly has the potential to be.It's a great premise. Hancock has powers comparable to those of Superman, and in this age of every-other-blockbuster being of comic book origins, it's refreshing to accept that these talents are a given, bypassing the usual far-fetched back story that could encumber the tale of comical super-heroism. The film dives straight into the action and flies along at a blistering pace, a trait now inherent with one-to-watch director Peter Berg, who seems to have perfected his intense hand-held style that served him so well during 'the Kingdom' (2007).Hancock is a funny one. Not just in the humorous sense either. Yes, there are head-up-the-ass gags and plenty of cartoon-esquire visual humour (though the best of this has already been seen in the previews and pre-release hype), but there are large amounts of well executed action and even soap style drama to boot. It's also funny, in that it's odd. It's not easily pigeonholed. Contrary to the hype, this isn't a typical summer blockbuster or spoof superhero fluff. Will Smith plays his part just as seriously as he has in his latest roles, the Oscar nominated 'Pursuit of Happiness' (2006), and 'Ali' (2001), even last year's 'I am Legend'. The film's marketing touts Hancock's comedy values, but in reality the Fresh Prince doesn't crack a smile throughout. The comedy is entirely consequential, going on around the title character but never as a result of a wisecrack or quip that we know the actor can handle so deftly. It's a brave move, and it's to the credit of Smith, Berg, and the film's writers that, for the most part, it's a gamble that pays off.Further praise must go to Director Peter Berg's incredibly confident execution, particularly given his relatively short directorial career. The tight structure, distinctive camera work and sheer pace really show his skill and individuality.If Hancock had stuck with the original premise  the hero's road to redemption - for which there's more than enough material to fill the scant 92 minute running time, then this could have been a real winner. As portrayed so effectively in the recent Iron Man, there's plenty of fun to be had from a hero honing his skills. The scene is set for Hancock to really exploit the comedic potential of this concept as he goes cold turkey and works towards perfecting his powers. Unfortunately, this opportunity is, to a certain extent, squandered as it's over all too soon.The decision to fall back on the familiar 'how it all began' plot line, after spending the first half of the film rendering this device redundant seems more destructive than any of the lead character's actions. Subsequently, the second half of the film is a disappointment with the third act in particular being surprisingly downbeat. The tale of origins is pointless nonsense and completely unnecessary given such a promising premise.Hancock has some laugh out loud moments and action set pieces to rival any of the big name comic blockbusters we've seen so far this year, but like the man himself, it's nowhere near as super as it could be.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It isn't out to save the world...,"Hancock is not nearly as bad as it is being rampaged against. Certainly it is not able to measure up to Iron Man or Batman Begins in terms of great storytelling and eye-popping special effects. Yet, it has a simple and fun tone to it that makes it pure popcorn flick material that is altogether entertaining. Will Smith dominates the screen as the mysterious and all-powerful Hancock, a superhero who looks and acts like a normal person, yet can perform incredible feats. Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron give adequate performances as two people that have an important effect on Hancock's life. There is a major twist that comes about halfway through the story, and from there the film does get significantly weaker. Nevertheless, the story moves on crisply and we are always intrigued by what might happen next. So, I say give it a chance. You may not like it at all. But, if you are a fan of the superhero genre, this is a different take on the same type of story with some good acting and decent special effects. See it for what it is: a Will Smith vehicle with plenty of charisma and style.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This film gave me a headache.,"Hancock - The streets of New York are simultaneously protected and suffer the excessive collateral damage done by Hancock (Will Smith), a none too nice and largely ineffective superhero. He saves the life of a similarly ineffective (though is not presented as so) personal relations agent named Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) who is so grateful that he dedicates his career to improving Hancock's image, despite the lack of any real fiscal benefits from doing so. But Embrey is one of those humanitarian P.R. reps you read so much about, whose pitch to the corporations always seems to involve them giving away their products for free. They unsurprisingly decide to do otherwise.The first thirty minutes or so of the film are decent enough. It's mildly amusing to watch a superhero that genuinely doesn't seem to give a crap about anything. Hancock causes a tremendous amount of collateral damage. But if he ultimately doesn't care about people, then why try and help at all? Hancock is supposed to be an ""asshole"", but comes off as just morose. Smith's been playing that a lot lately and judging by the box office receipts, it's what people want. The film could explore why Hancock feels he owes anything at all to these people. It does not. Note to filmmakers: Never make a superhero without motivation.It's when Hancock voluntarily goes to jail that the film slants into place getting ready for a tremendous nose dive. It becomes boring (superhero sits around in jail = fun movie?) and changes from a comedy to a drama, a critical mistake partly because the writing of the second half is seriously lackluster. The other reason is the special effects are just not good enough for a dramatic film. They come off as cartoonish. Things disintegrate on impact far too easily like there was nothing holding them together in the first place. If Hancock has the mass and strength to stop a train without any recoil and makes craters on landings (inconsistently for comic purposes I suppose), then shouldn't the mere act of walking or running around cause mild earthquakes?I mentioned the second half of the film. It absolutely sucks. I was having a migraine trying to figure out what was going on with Charlize Theron's character, and her's and Hancock's back story in general. The whole thing doesn't make a lick of sense. There's just a series of fights for absolutely no reason other that to satisfy action junkies. This is the first and hopefully last time I ever see Jason Bateman take part in an action sequence. Hancock really felt rushed, I assume because the call of the July 4th box office. Money beats art any day of the week. The producers of Hancock know this, and Bateman's character should have known it too.Boring and rushed in appearance and execution, Hancock gets a D+",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

But there's something about it that makes me keep coming back.Just watched it again and it still stands up. It's running time is refreshing, it's a stand alone that doesn't need expanding or a sequel. It's explained as much as it needs to and you fill in the gaps.The performances are great and after just watching Jupiter's Legacy they aren't bad for the time.What I'm trying to say is that Hancock is a grower that maybe didn't have the impact it should have done but helped tickle our taste buds for the MCU & DCU.Could the last act have been improved... definitely but I personally love the switch in tone.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

When a normal man in a simple outfit became a superhero.,"Hancock is a reluctant superhero who has the ability to lift oil tanks and fly, but his involvement in fighting crime has made him unpopular in Los Angeles. As long as he isn't called a villain he doesn't care. Then Ray, a decent PR executive who is even rarer, appears; with his assistance, Hancock might develop into a kinder, more compassionate kind of superhero.Do we even care? No, not at all, especially since the film's humorous first half gives way to a more serious second. As Smith attempts to play a surly curmudgeon but ultimately begs for our love, director Peter Berg stages a special effects spectacle that is quite monotonous and doesn't quite blind us to the weaknesses of the writing.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A sad story about superheroes,"Many people have said it's not a good movie. I agree. It's not. Not even close. However, they've taken it as a comedy. I'm afraid I have to reserve my opinion on that.It was funny at the beginning but turned out to be a sad love story when Mary revealed the truth. Superheroes are created in pairs but doomed to be separated since they would lose their power if they got too close to each other. History has proved that all of the superheroes were killed except them two.Mary said ""we're brother and sister"". She said ""technically he's my husband"". She didn't lie. They are immortal. Through all the centuries, the connections between them are more than those of siblings and couples. They are the only two of their kind in this world but they have to run away from each other to guarantee the safety of their lives. Is there anything else more pathetic? It's such a just-so-so movie that I hardly laughed or be impressed throughout the whole 97 minutes. But I felt a little bit touched about two scenes. One is when Ray said to Hancock ""people don't like you"", his son Aaron shouted ""I do"". The other is bearing all the sores and wounds physically and mentally, Hancock hobbled his way to far far away to save Mary.Heroes are doomed to be alone but they'll never be lonely. They have someone very special to care about and be cared back. Hancock is not able to be with Ray, Mary and Aaron but he watches them and guard them from far far away. He tells his love by that red heart on the moon.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hancock > The Hulk,"Hancock is better than The Hulk and is as good as Iron Man, and here's why.Some reviews I've read on this board seem malignant as they continually rain on good movies parades. They actually see movies with the feeling that they WANT the film to fail. Why, so you can talk trash about it on a message board? I will start this review off by saying there's not a single thing wrong with this movie. Sure, some people feel as if they would have made it differently, but that's not them. They're not the ones behind the scripts or the cameras. Behind them is a team devoted to bringing us what we love about a summer movie: great action sequences, cool characters, and a decent story with good looking people. That's the definition of a summer movie people. Now, moving on...I thought I had seen all the best moments the movie had to offer in the previews, but low and behold I was wrong. The scenes in the trailer take place within the first 30 minutes, while the next hour is a well developed story involving superhero origins, complicated relationships and some intense action.You can pretty much guess the story from the trailer, however the movie is far from predictable; a man with super powers who is depressed wants to help the world while society shuns him. Feeling he can help, Jason Bateman's character Ray decided to invest in Hancock and make him personable again. You know he spends time in jail, hates it, then gets called to help out the city when it's in trouble. That's the story right there. Granted there are more twists and turns involving our hero but it is not, repeat NOT what you expect. Will Smith is also very funny in this movie, cursing at neighbors and children while maintaining his A-Hole approach to a hero.The story is ORIGINAL, something hardly any movie nowadays can claim, especially movies in the superhero genre. The background of the hero, as well was his powers' weakness is something I've never seen done before. And guess what? The bad guys are the bad guys! The bank robbers, purse snatchers, rapists and crooks are the people Hancock is battling against, something that all heroes should be fighting, not some made up villain that can easily match the good guy. This is why the story as well as the movie are fantastic.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Almost had it,"Hancock is an entertaining flick. It starts out great, its got a fantastic and unique idea for a superhero. I had a lot of fun watching Hancock's antics, emotions, and general attitude toward being a superhero. Some of the other characters were great as well, particularly the supporting character of Ray, the two of them made a great match. I was very happy to be watching this film for a good while but it fell apart when it came to establishing an effective ending. this is just my opinion of course, I enjoyed the movie but I felt a lot of it was ruined by the complications and twists that did not seem to connect very well with the rest of the story and its theme of self renewal and achievement. It went in all the right directions and made a great attempt at a new kind of story but it just didn't make it in the end.

"A mediocre movie, with impressive acting.","Hancock, boring? No. Entertaining? Yes. A great movie? Not so much. Does that some it up for you? Hancock was far from brilliant, but it's far from rubbish too. That put's it in the mediocre section.Will Smith was again outstanding. He made the movie good with his witty lines and superb acting. He played his roles a little different from his usual films, but that sure didn't stop him from impressing the world again. Far from your typical hero movie so don't even expect something like that, but that doesn't make the film bad at all. The film is different and that's what made the film watchable. The movie offers some laughs and OK action at times, but then some how the film get's draining and a little cheesy. Even though it was no ""real main villain"" when the so called villain was introduced into the film, his vengeance to get back the unusual non popular hero John Hancock seemed quite cheesy and weird at times.I would suggest the movie was pretty enjoyable but not brilliant. The beginning kicked off quite well, but the end was the most disappointing part if you ask me. But Smith's acting was superb.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A different hero movie...,"""Hancock"" is an Action - Fantasy movie in which we watch a superhero being reckless and careless about anything. All changes when he meets a person who believes in him and his potential, starting from the basics and continuing on the same way.I liked this movie mainly because it was a really different superhero movie and also because it did not follow the pattern of the previous superhero movies. The direction which was made by Peter Berg was very good and he presented very well the character of the superhero along with some unpredictable plot twists that made it even more interesting. The interpretations of Will Smith who played as John Hancock, Jason Bateman who played as Ray and Charlize Theron who played as Mary were very good and their combination worked very well.

"Good beginning and premise and then, disaster","I love Will Smith. I love Charlize Theron and Justin Bateman as actors. But this movie left me so cold I didn't wait till the extras after the credits cause I'd had enough. This movie is typical of all the recent Hollywood movies...it suffers from bad writing. Hancock has an excellent premise, antisuperhero who doesn't know what to do with the fact that he has been given special abilities. In most of the other superhero stories some mentor helps the hero learn who he is, but in this movie it's an Ad man, which is kind of cute. Will Smith does a great job as the antihero so what's the problem. The problem is the unimaginative writing that ruins a good experience by writing in some ridiculous relationship and back story for the characters. My god I just wanted to walk out when this whole stupid story emerged. But I suffered through till the end hoping something better would come of the mistake...that they would take if somewhere wonderful, but of course it didn't happen and I was left mad, empty and knowing that there would be a sequel.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Not a lot of tired old car chases, things blowing up, overblown fights or shoot-outs.Interesting plot, good cast, good acting, good characters, nothing was over-acted.

Good Flick...bad marketing.,"Hancock is the product of two very strong ideas that don't quite mesh as well as it's creators likely hoped. The first idea is that of an alcoholic superhero who only saves lives due to some natural compulsion that he can't fight but otherwise cares nothing for anybody. The other idea is a gritty realistic look at what life as a superhero would be like. The emphasis of the story is the latter, while the previews imply the former.The first half of the movie plays out similarly to a super powered bad Santa...making for some very good and unique laughs. As Hancock attempts to clean up his act though things take a much darker turn and we learn that Hancock does in fact have a heart and it's broken.If Super powers really did exist in this extremity Hancock's plot would likely be a pretty good representation of it's pitfalls. The guy's lonely as all hell, he drinks, he costs millions in property damage for every act of heroics. This is something different that we've never seen, Spider-man's not always loved by everyone he saves but at least he was never handed a bill for breaking a window.Despite a good box office return I think feelings of the movie from it's general audience were only Luke warm but I think it will appreciate in value as time goes on. It's a superhero drama with a very interesting and original plot, it's just too bad it was marketed as a superhero action comedy. A stronger villain would've have helped to inject more action into the movie and possibly would have made everybody happy...the movie is a little slow but I've seen it a couple times and it's already grown more on me. I urge everybody to give a chance...even if it's a second one.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

How Did This Get Messed Up So Badly?,"How can a movie with this much potential turn out the way it did? You're given a large budget with actors like Charlize Theron and Jason Bateman. Then, you add Will Smith, the biggest box-office draw on the market. It must take an absolute mess of a director to ruin a film with this much potential.The movie rides on special effects. For the most part, they're well done, however, some scenes prove otherwise. For instance, when Will Smith is flying on the freeway, it is extremely obvious that it was all done on a green screen. In fact, many of the special effects look as though they weren't completely finished.As for the performances, they're the best part of the movie. Will Smith will keep you laughing as always. Jason Bateman continues to prove that he deserves great roles. All-in-all, this is the best aspect of the movie.The story, however, is the downfall of this film. There is a twist halfway through the film that will make you cringe with disgust. And the explanation for it all is even worse. Sure, it all makes sense, but it is incredibly stupid. The humor is often misplaced in the film and the director must have had an identity crisis in regards to the film's genre. It goes from G-rated family comedy dialogue (not in a good way) to drama to comedy to action and all the way back again in a matter of several minutes. Now, I don't mind when a movie crosses genres, but this movie does it poorly.It's sorely disappointing that a movie with so much potential turned out as poorly as it did. It will make money nonetheless, but the fans deserve better than this predictable, mediocre film. Will Smith will give you enough entertainment, but even he can't save the movie.

Good ideas spoiled by a messy movie,"I was not expecting much from Hancock. After his dramatic turn in the rather disappointing The Pursuit of Happiness, and the promising but fatally flawed I Am Legend, I was not sure I was going to be able to accept and genuinely enjoy another Will Smith movie. And sure enough, even going in with low expectations was not enough.Hancock tells the story of the titular hero (Smith), who in a rather original move, is a mean-spirited alcoholic. He helps save the day for many in Los Angeles, but at the price of causing millions of dollars worth of damage, and offending just about everyone. He saves Ray Embry (Jason Bateman), a public relations agent, from certain death, and as a thank you, Ray wants to clean up Hancock's image.The actual great thing about Hancock is that it is, for the most part, an original idea. Yes, comic book fans may recognize the alcoholism as a trademark of Tony Stark, but it makes for a hell of a character dynamic for this so-called superhero. As well, unlike the comic book film superheroes we have come to understand, Hancock does not want to be a hero. He just wants to be appreciated for what he does do, and left alone all the rest of the time. And of course, as would be typical for Smith, Hancock is a bit of a wise-ass. All of these elements lead to a superhero character unlike any we have seen (although he borrows from Superman's books and can fly and deflect bullets).But unfortunately, that is nearly the only great thing this movie has to offer.The movie plays itself loose and extremely fast. The brief explanation I gave for the film encompasses nearly half an hour of the film's running time. And for a film that runs less than an hour and a half, that may sound like a bit much to chew on. But somehow, the film flies through from point to point, only pausing for seconds at a time to explain what is happening. And much like I Am Legend, the film veers off into a completely different direction in the third act that nearly completely defeats the purpose of the previous two (although anyone who knows the big revealing moment already may be disappointed to know it does not build on much more). In this case, it attempts to explain the mythology behind the character, but fails because of how convoluted and useless it sounds. Even worse is the dramatic tone change from action romp to hardcore drama that is handled even less well.It is obvious even as early as the film's opening shots that director Peter Berg is trying to do something different. As if taking on an original superhero was not enough, Berg wanted to make it feel even less like a superhero movie, and more like a coming-of-age/outsider tale. While this is an admirable thought, the script is not nearly strong enough to let it happen. It just does not seem to know what it wants to be, and has an even bigger problem trying to understand its main character. Should we feel sorry for him? Maybe at the beginning, but less and less as the film goes along. Its three distinct acts are just that: distinct. They all want to accomplish something different, and when meshed together, they just do not work out. The ideas may be intriguing, but there should have been more experienced writers on hand to explore them.What is even more inexcusable is the lack of development in the supporting characters. While Hancock has something to work with early on, the rest of the cast has to hobble along just to hold themselves up. Bateman's character has an ongoing subplot about an idea he has for pharmaceutical companies to benefit the less fortunate, but we understand very little about who he is, and even less about how wealthy he appears to be (despite some rather negative feedback on the idea he has). He is basically negated to simply watching Hancock do his thing after he works his PR magic. Charlize Theron, cast as Bateman's wife Mary, has something about her right from the moment she pops on screen. You can tell the filmmakers are trying to play up on her development by making her so cynical about Hancock, but when her character finally needs to be used, she falters and flops in an instant. Her character serves a point, but at the expense of being useless all the rest of the time. The rest of the supporting cast, save for The Embrey's adorable son Aaron (Jae Head), are all underused to the point that crediting them would be a waste of time.Smith, attempts to make his character work, but the inherent problems at the core of Hancock's script plague his good work. Yes, he can play wise-ass very good, but he has some good moments of pathos, but not nearly enough to make the audience truly feel for him. Smith plays the character much like others, with very little regard for not basically playing himself (or at least, the image he displays for the public). Maybe another dose of The Pursuit of Happiness, where he is very un-Will Smith-like, is exactly what the man needs to wake up and actually show off some form of acting chops.Thankfully, the music and special effects pull through basically unscathed (although a few of the flying scenes looked terribly fake).While at its heart, Hancock may have been a good idea for a new superhero movie, it did not turn out to be one in the end. Bad writing and sloppy direction take away from any great ideas that could have been infused into the script, and sadly, it does not look like anyone appears to care. And unfortunately, that is the saddest thing about this mess of a movie.4/10.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Completely Original and Refreshing,"This movie has received a lot of negative feedback due to people disliking the genre. These nay-sayers have most likely not even seen the movie or walked into the theater with a bad taste in their mouths and were determined to denounce the film before even watching it. With that being said Hancock is not revolutionary, however, you won't be dissatisfied when exiting the theater after seeing this film. Will Smith and Charlize Theron being their full spectrum of experience to the screen and definitely do not leave this film lacking in emotion. Hancock contains an even mix of comedy, romance, and action and fully delivers as an unorthodox action superhero film. The one annoyance to the film is Jason Bateman's similar acting style in Hancock to his character in Arrested Development. Though his acting is fitting for his role in Hancock, it is also very stereotypical for Bateman and comes of a bit irritating when the movie includes stills of Bateman's facial expressions that are identical to his expressions in Arrested Development. Overall the movie was a solid 8.0 and might even be considered an 8.5 for sheer originality in the superhero film genre.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Nutshell Review: Hancock,"I'll stick my neck out and state this: Should anyone tell you Hancock is not a good superhero movie, then that somebody probably isn't a superhero comic book fan to begin with. Or perhaps prefers the heroes as morally upright boy scouts with unexplainable fetish for Lycra tights. And for those who reckon that the Hancock trailer had shown its hand, for once I thought that a trailer barely, and I mean barely, scratched the surface of what surprisingly was a thoroughly enjoyable story, which will take its stand proudly amongst this year's line up of comic book/super hero movies.But first, I'd got to admit, I'm a Will Smith fan. So at least you might have this review put into perspective. I've been enjoying the Will Smith Express with the kind of movies he's been doing for his career, even for the badly received Wild Wild West. But this guy has been in almost every genre from action (thanks to Michael Bay) to science fiction with I, Robot, romantic comedy with Hitch, a powerful dramatic performance with Pursuit of Happiness, and the recent remake I Am Legend, and each one I find little or no fault with. In fact, save for one or two movies in his filmography which I have not watched, it's no wonder that Smith's A-list material for his legion of fans around the world, having a name that can marquee a blockbuster movie, and one of the more consistently bankable contemporary stars.And Hancock (ok, for this review I'd lay off all the jokes) continues in this tradition of entertainment that isn't frivolous. To tell you more about the story would be to ruin whatever surprise it has in store, so I'll not do that. Suffice to say that like all superhero movies, Hancock is also about sacrifice, and I think that's a theme that the genre cannot do away with. It's almost always an exploration about doing the right thing, be it for the love of mankind, or those that touch on the more personal. If you'd believe the trailer as it suggests, then it's suffice to say that Hancock had to grapple with bad public relations from his jerk like behaviour (stuffing heads up arses being his arsenal of choice), and that assistance comes free through the services of Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), a life which he saved by, well, causing millions of dollars in damages. If I were to scratch the surface just a little bit deeper, then I'd say that Ray represents the kind of normal life that Hancock probably wished to have, the simple, no save-the-world responsibility lifestyle, with a nice little family with wife Mary (Charlize Theron) and son Aaron (Jae Head) to boot.Director Peter Berg, who last brought us The Kingdom, dabbles with plenty of technology to bring us a man who can fly, possess incredible strength and being invulnerable to bullets. What I'd enjoyed about his take on this superhero movie, is that he didn't find a need to explain everything in verbatim, i.e. what are the powers he possess, where did he come from, and so on. sure they are addressed, but there's no need for putting it in your face, which I suspect lesser directors would have filmed flashbacks, origin subplots, enemies who are megalomaniacs who want to conquer the universe, and so on. They can be mentioned in passing, or a glance, or to let it work it out in your imagination, which of course is a powerful tool. And keeping it simple helped too, as I was really thrilled at how effective, and deceptively simple, its crescendo was developed, that it's tough to fight back tears as it goes for the juggernaut to reach out for your emotions.Clearly there were bits from the trailer which were probably put in as red herrings, or likely to have been reserved for the DVD as deleted scenes. While it runs at just over 90 minutes, the pace is frenetic, though of course not without the usual loopholes, especially with a major sequence probably to show off some cool graphics. If I were to gripe about certain things, it would be how YouTube got a significant product placement, and not actually having the actual, exact clips available (I may be wrong but I did do a search), and having the camera seemed to want to take a jab at Will Smith action movies of old by continuously circling around his face ala Bad Boys. Some may also gripe about not having to see much of the born again Hancock in action, but again, the strength of this movie lies not in how it delivers its set action pieces.So what's my verdict? To Berg, Smith and the rest of the cast and crew, Good Job! And don't be a jerk and bolt for the exits the minute the end credits start to roll, or you deserve to have your head stuffed up another's arse.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
seriously one of the best movies i have seen in long time!,"First off i was hesitant to see this movie because of some of the negative reviews on here... glad i did see it! It was great! The plot was original and the choice of actors was exceptional! Some people said the story dragged, i didn't think it did at all! It actually went by too fast, they could have added more scenes! Will smith was great, and i am in love with Jason Batemen! When he starts to become the lovable hero, you cant help but wish he was real! the twist was amazing, i honestly didn't see it coming! and i usually guess a lot of movie twists! if you like comedy, action, and just an all around great summer flick.... Go see Hancock!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hancock symbolism - there is no bad film if you attempt interpret it,"This is a story of a bored demigod (Will Smith) who, for unknown reason, acts as a policeman, sort of. His rescue operations cause as much damage as a potential good. In the process, people get killed and property destroyed on the grand scale. The problem with Hancock is mostly related to his image  he already does good but is under-appreciated because he does not make everyone around him feel good (see the difference between 'do good' and 'feel-good'), rather he ensures that bad guys' butts and heads are connected in a convoluted configurations, a device invented especially for this 'moving pictures'. This is another way to ensure that we get the power of the guy  flying and kicking ass is one thing, but sticking a fellow's head in another fellow's butt is quite another, requiring a certain degree of previously unbeknownst sophistication.Having established the need for improvements in our hero's image, a PR man is introduced. And of course, you guessed it, it happened to be very decent PR man. He wants to shower humanity with goodness also because of some unknown to us reasons  may be it makes him feel good, or maybe he was told by Jesus to do so. Hancock saves the PR man and he, in gratitude, starts working on hero's image. They devise a plan by which Hancock voluntarily removes himself from society by going to jail (yes, this is how one is removed from society). Now, people are made to understand, how it is without our hero. Crime's up 30% and Hancock is recalled to save, now grateful, humanity.It just feels that something is missing  the plot requires more action. It turns out that PR man's wife happens also to be a demigod, who used to be married to our hero, but had to distance herself from him because it was lethal for both of them. You see, they both loose powers in each other presence, they are poison for each other, a mutual kryptonite. You know, this thing happen to some powerful couples, who can not decide who bring home the bacon. So, the she-hero stays with the PR man, while Hancock will continue saving the world. In the mean time, we, in the comfort of our entertainment facilities, experience the sublime, safely and without any danger to our health. Do we get entertained? Do we get our money worth? Does this film relax us? For god's sake, should we see this film or not?Let me answer the big questions in the following way. Suppose we view Hancock as a symbol, for example, as US of A. The US saves the world by acting as world policeman; unilaterally exercising its power, flying hither and dither (think Afghanistan, Iraq). US sticks bad guy's heads into bad guy's butts (think Abu Ghraib). The damage US inflicts onto 'rogue' nations, lost human lives are weighed against the potential good. Meanwhile, we experience the sublime on TV projected by CNN, comfortably resting on sofas and lazy-boy chairs with popcorn and beer.I think, Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan could do much better with their plot by simply following major event of the latest US wars, using US = Hancock symbolism. And Will Smith? - yes, camera loves him. But for me, it is a memory of Six Degrees of Separation that beacons me to the movie theater to see his performances. It is regrettable, that after amassing such personal success, wealth and authority, he produces such low grade output. But I keep hoping and he's not the worst that Hollywood can offer.Now, to answer the big question  Do I regret seeing this film? The answer is no; and not because of the film itself, not because its entertainment value, nor because it made me better or relaxed me and helped me to get through the day. Rather because of the polemic energy it gave me to write this note and share it with others. Now I can be, vicariously, a super-hero, better than Hancock, flying high in my imagination, having this discussion with Will Smith himself on the public forum, dispensing him my free advice. This is real power. And as to my vicarious experience and the lack of real super-powers - perhaps this is a good thing.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Hancock is far underrated,"Hancock is exactly what you would expect if a normal person was suddenly imbued with super powers. Jason Bateman is at his best in this movie, and Will Smith was the perfect pick to play Hancock. The two of them together are so natural that I am surprised they have not done more movies together.

A fun ride,"Like death, taxes, and a summer blockbuster season featuring a Will Smith vehicle, some things in life are inevitable. It's 2008, and the year's high water mark for big-budget Hollywood releases, and Hancock is the Fresh Prince's film de jour. Before you start rolling your eyes, however, there's something you must know about this release. it's damn good! In fact, given the story behind the making of this movie, such praise is somewhat surprising.Originally penned by Vincent Ngo back in 1996, the screenplay passed through the hands of various directors, including Tony Scott and Michael Mann (Mann stayed on in the capacity of Producer), and went through a number of cuts to both conform to cinema ratings and tweak the story after test screenings, the latter rarely being a good omen. Which makes it all the more surprising that Hancock out-Supers Superman, out-X's X-Men, out-smarts the Hulk (no great achievement there).I could go on but you get the picture. Hancock is the superhero flick that summer popcorn movies aspire to. And, it does it with attitude and laughs to boot.Smith plays John Hancock, a drunken drifter who possesses many of the same powers as Superman. He can fly, bullets bounce off him, he has super strength, is faster than a speeding bullet, and, oh yeah, he's an asshole (but don't call him that). Basically he's what Superman would be if he was a booze swilling, hungover, homeless person who wouldn't think twice about ramming your head up your arse if you so much as looked at him cock-eyed.His crime fighting antics (when he's up to it) haven't endeared him to Los Angeles authorities either, seeing how he has a penchant for widespread property damage whenever he goes into action. All of which serves as a problem which needs to be fixed, and that's where PR wiz Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) comes into play, offering to try and rehabilitate Hancock's public image after the hero rescues him from near death.Directed by Peter Berg (The Kingdom), the movie deftly mixes comedic and action moments in a refreshingly even blend, and its story is peppered with enough origin references to lay the groundwork for prequels and sequels, of which you can be sure there will be several. Basically they've created a fully-realized movie franchise without the luxury of a long line of comics or graphic novels to lay the groundwork.If there's one flaw to Hancock (the movie, not the character), it's that it lacks a credible super villain, someone who can really give him a run for his money. Sure it has the cookie-cutter bad guy, but he's really nothing more than a thug with a gun, and no real match for our hero. He's basically a moron's Lex Luthor, without any aces (or anything else) up his sleeve, and an action movie built around a virtually invincible superhero needs a foil of at least credible strength.Nonetheless, the acting, pacing, story and special effects all compensate for this weakness, making Hancock a fun ride. Just don't ever call him an asshole.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Starts big and quickly goes downhill...,"When I saw previews for this movie, I was sure that it would be a good popcorn flick, if not the must see movie of the summer (second to TDK of course). Well long story short, I went to the matinée and I still felt like I overpaid.This movie doesn't know what it wants to be- it's comedy/action for the first 45 minutes, drama for the next 40, and corny, gag me please garbage for the last 5.The jokes fell flat and nobody in the theater knew what was supposed to be funny. The resolution was pretty lame as well. I hoped Jason Bateman could bring some humor to the story, as I am a big fan of Arrested Development, but he just doesn't have the tools or dialogue to do so here. Things start to get ""serious"" story-wise and the plot elements are so ridiculous all you can do is groan and roll your eyes.Final Verdict : DDon't go to it.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertaining blockbuster with brains,"No doubt about it, at the beginning of the film you won't find the idea of spending 100 minutes with the surly John Hancock a pleasant one. He is a superhero who, despite saving many lives and catching even more criminals in his duty, also causes millions of dollars of damage, and his grumpy unsociable demeanour does not win him over with the public in his native LA. But all fears that this film will be as tetchy and charmless as its eponymous star are quickly banished.Hancock is a superhero film that drops all the natural clichés and instead goes about its business doing things its own way. There is no big ""origin"" scene, no defined hero and villain; rather there is a set of characters that must learn to live with each other.Will Smith, one of the few Hollywood stars that will guarantee a profit-turning film, delivers a convincing performance as the washed-up superhuman Hancock, particularly considering that ""charmless"" is not his forte. Apart from going against his natural type-cast, Smith is not required to give too much to this performance, leaving the special effects to do the bulk of the job, which they do with gusto. No doubt the main objective of the film is to entertain the masses, and it does this considerably well, maintaining an intense pace throughout and adding more twists and turns than would normally be found in a film twice its length.In its bid to engage, it does leave a noticeable hole where characterization should be. Only briefly is the subject of the loneliness of Hancock touched upon, and Hancock's PR guru, Ray, is far too one-dimensional considering his role to the plot. The importance of this character is played up in the film's first half, and then diminished in the closing half as his wife, played by Charlize Theron, replaces him as the film's second main character.This film is by no means faultless, but in terms of blockbusters, particularly superhero blockbusters, it is unpredictable, inventive and, bar a sugar-sweet ending, far removed from the formulaic plots that generally clog up the summer schedules. Despite this, it still manages to do what all big-budget films strive to achieve, and that is to entertain.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A GREAT movie poorly reviewed,"At first, I thought this movie was going to be a comedy, it's not. It has lots of very funny moments, but they are the result of a very lonely superhero. I love comedies. To me, funny and revealing of the character, is much better humor than just funny to be amusing.The plot twist everyone talks about is revealed relatively early, about midway through, and the rest of the story hinges on it. It's nicely foreshadowed and stunning when ""the truth comes out."" The truth is a doozy and puts everything prior to it into a brand new perspective. The last time I saw movie that did as good of a job at a plot point as this movie was ""L.A. Confidential,"" an admittedly different kind of film.Would the movie suffer if its producers choose to reveal the plot twist? Actually, I think not. I think the entire marketing campaign should have been based on that revelation. It would have put the movie in a different perspective and rather than critics panning it, they would have embraced it and loved it.It's truly too bad, because this is a gem of a film. Read the reviews for it carefully... pro and con... think about who the reviewer is and how credible their opinion is to you. Yes, this is a ""superhero"" movie, but it's more in the vein of the Spiderman movies than it is X-Men. I truly liked this movie and cannot wait for it to come out on DVD so I can enjoy it with family and friends and get their take on it, too.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Loved It,"Wow, I have learned for the umpteenth time that I have to make my own decisions about what to see. When Hancock first came out, because of all the negative reviews that appeared in the newspapers, I did not rush to see it, and I am very sorry about that. I just saw it and, and I really enjoyed it. First and foremost, this film is a love story. It just so happens that it uses the superhero genre to tell it. Although I would agree that the numerous bathroom jokes were childish and detracted from the film, I feel that the negative reviewers lacked the maturity and sophistication to see that, seeing as how most superhero films of late are spoofs, the makers of Hancock chose a spoof of those spoofs as an entertaining and attention-diverting backdrop on which to paint a portrait of love. And not just love between two people. The love in this story is between all of the protagonists--father, mother, son, and Hancock, and ultimately about the love between all things that feel. If you can let your hair down, I believe that this fun and genuinely imaginative film will provide you with smiles, perhaps a tear, and a very warm glow.

Hancock: A real let-down to the slot of summer films,"The idea seemed interesting at first, a drunk superhero. In the end came a movie that didn't turn out so great. I was expecting another fun Will Smith Comedy. What I got was something that turned out to be utterly...what's the word? lame.basically from beginning to end it was nothing but Will Smith drunk, flying around and breaking things. So there was nothing else that contributed it. Only one good one-liner came out of his mouth.It also proved that Charlize Theron can not pull off a comic movie, no offense I think she's beautiful and was fantastic in MONSTER'S BALL.Overall I was completely disappointed with this movie. But mainly, I'm disappointed in Will Smith generally. I started not to like him the moment he began to study scientology and began to befriend Tom Cruise.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hancock is a superhero flick with a twist,"Hancock is a superhero movie which holds a more interesting concept compared to its comic book inspired contemporaries, for while those films hold the usual tales of hero's with dual identities who continue to fight the eternal fight of good VS evil, Hancock's main protagonist is a crude superhero living in a PC world who must make amends for the disastrous consequences of his heroic deeds. Former Fresh Prince and current reigning king of the summer blockbuster Will Smith plays the tile character Hancock, a boozing loner and all around prick whose often well intentioned heroism leads to often catastrophic results and a spiraling out of control collateral damage bill. During one of his heroic exhibitions, Hancock saves the life of bleeding heart public relations agent Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) who believes that Hancock is in need of a dire image change and offers his services as payback for saving his life. Hancock begrudgingly agrees and is convinced to voluntarily turn himself over to the authorities (who have several hundred outstanding citations against him) and do time in prison in a bid to win public affection and clean up his act. His stint in prison gives way to one of the more hilarious scenes thus far this year involving one prisoners head being thrust into another prisoners rear end! It is crass, but it works. With the first half passed what has been presented is an entertaining urban superhero movie which comes dangerously close to having already shot its load. However, with a switch of genre and some nicely placed twists, a love triangle is established between Hancock, Ray, and Ray's wife Mary (Charlize Theron) which adds some more spice to the unconventional superhero film. And so it goes, as the film jumps from comedy to action to drama and does so quite nicely. Throughout it all the films three leads adapt very well to the shifts in genre, especially the versatile Will Smith who hits all of the right notes. Charlize Theron  who I usually do not look forward to watching due to her often pretentious and dour portrayals of late  seems to be having the most fun on screen that I can remember, and low key comedy maestro Jason Bateman continues to forge a reputation of becoming quite the scene stealer, ala Bill Murray. Keeping the film on a steady register is Michael Mann protégé Peter Berg, who was brought in after several directors attached to the film before him moved on to different projects. Berg's gritty tones and shaky cam styling blends very well with the films big budget fodder, most notably the special and visual effects which are a visceral treat. Since Hancock does not play slave to a source material, it does not come off as generic. The only film which comes close to matching its concepts would be the excellent animated film The Incredibles. Yet while its script may be shaky  especially with its talk of Gods walking amongst men  the films performances and Berg's spirited direction make up for whatever flaws are present.Matthew Pejkovic, Matt's Movie Reviews",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Terrible  Cinematography,"I will confine my comments to the cinematography of this movie. Have these guys ever heard of a tripod? Even when the subjects were not moving the camera was all over the place. Closeups were too close with the frame consisting of two eyes, a nose and a mouth. Shots were too short-often as little as two or three seconds. The action scenes reminded me of the Batman ride I took at Great America. Things went by me so fast that I couldn't focus on anything that I saw during the ride. Apparently this style of filming is considered to be a new type of cinematographic art form.

"A 'kick-ass' film and the film ""Kick-Ass"" should have been...","Peter Berg's ""Hancock"" really took me off-guard, I avoided it for many years expecting some spoof of the superhero movie genre, which I'm not even a fan to begin with. And the beginning almost fooled me, a spectacular car chase intercut with a hung-over Hancock (Will Smith) sleeping on a bench and awaken by that kid from ""The Middle"". It takes him a while to get up, which is plausible for someone who still got the bottle in his hand, and when he took off, it just reminded me of Woody's comment about Buzz: he doesn't fly, he falls in style. And for some strange reason, despite all the obvious CGI, the flying stunts looked realistic and that's one of the delights of ""Hancock"".Indeed, there's no reason to have a superhero flying like some torpedo, missile or rocket, Hancock's flying consist of high jumping and trying to fall on the right spot, which doesn't go without costing a few bucks to the community. And when he stops the criminals by impaling their car over a tower after a ride that had its share of collateral damages, Hancock's not exactly acclaimed like a hero but booed and insulted. It's so fun and refreshing to see movies questioning the consequences of a superhero's action, ""The Incredibles"" did that in 2004 but ""Hancock"" takes that element seriously and it's the right tone. If it wasn't serious, it would have made his character a major goofball we would have instantly liked, but the point isn't to like Hancock.Precisely, he's a bitter, ill-mannered man who couldn't care less but for some reason, still cares. So when PR executive Ray (Jason Bateman) is stuck on the railroad Hancock saves him from the train collision by throwing his car backwards (instead of taking it away) and causes a train wreck by blocking it. After that, Ray sees the man who's just saved his life being insulted by an angry crowd, and naturally, decides to help him back by restoring his heroic public image. He invites Hancock to his house where he meets his son Aaron and his wife Mary (Charlize Theron) who obviously looks at him just like Jean Arthur looked at Alan Ladd in ""Shane"". We haven't seen enough movies if we don't guess there's history between them, but whatever expectation we have, it'll be a big surprise.Another surprise is in the interesting shift of genres, from comedy to drama, with an intermediary section set in a jail. The sequence shows all the efforts to rehabilitate Hancock, we see him handling the prisoners, sometimes it contributes to hilarious sight gags that remind us not to take the material too seriously, and sometimes we see the 'Will Smith' of ""Happyness"" and ""Seven Pounds"" trying to change, to be a better man. His presence in the jail is vital to the development of his character since he can go out at any time but he's ready to play the game, to accept the rules, except maybe when it comes to ""shooting some b-ball"" outside the court. After serving part of his sentence, learning a few lessons about how to congratulate the police force, how to fly and land without causing major damages and learning to be nice, the test comes.Hancock's called for an emergency, he shaves his beard, puts on a tight uniform with an eagle logo and go meet his destiny. He stops the robbery in all professionalism and efficiency, earning him finally the cheers of the by-standers, the police and the journalists. This is where the choice to have a serious action picture instead of a comedy pays off, if Hancock was comical, his ovation at the bank would have been a triumphant and happy moment, instead, it's a moving and emotional epiphany for him, and a fine transition to the third act that finally reveals the deal between Mary and Hancock. And it's such a particular story that it could have been handled in a sequel but the Mary storyline with a revenge from a few villains tie up the plot together in a heart-pounding finale.And I was surprised Roger Ebert didn't mention it in his review, because the climax reminded me totally of the bond between Elliott and E.T the Extra-Terrestrial and it might even reveal what the film is ultimately about: energy. There is a positive energy and a negative one, Hancock had the same forces and skills but before he turned into a decent guy, he was full of negative vibrations that impacted his actions. He couldn't stand people calling him a certain name maybe because he used that same insult against himself. By interiorizing his doubts, his wounds, his questions about his past for years and years, he turned himself into that bitter jerk. Ray could finally unveil the good side of him and allow him to ope to people, it's an interesting metamorphosis from one energy to another.And naturally there's the energetic connection between Hancock and Mary whose respective backstories are finally revealed and make the final confrontations not just spectacular but incredibly poignant. ""Hancock"" is a good movie because it's about a superhero who's a good man surrounded by good persons and learn how to be even better not just by being brave or polite but also selfless. And in the way Berg mixes between genres, from action-packed comedy to emotional drama, I will say that ""Hancock"" kicks ass and is the film ""Kick-Ass"" should have been.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
GREAT MOVIE!!! different than the typical superhero film.,"I'll try to make my comments short and sweet. I thought the movie was great. It had plenty of action and a great plot. I was glued to the screen the whole time and not wanting the movie to end. All actors and actresses did a great job with their roles. I never used to care for Will Smith too much, but man this guy has been doing amazing lately. I'm looking forward to seeing what he does next.Back to the movie, From what I hear the people that didn't enjoy it as much blame it on the quality of some special effects, but the average eye wouldn't notice a thing wrong with them. Also a few people aren't into the twist the movie throws..(Which is completely original) I wont go any further into that.Overall, the movie is awesome. Give it a chance for sure. Though, I warn you, if you are wanting another superman or spider man... don't watch Hancock.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Nice movie but it stops after the prelude,"I've just watched hancock and i must say it's a really decent superheromovie. I really liked this worn-off gruffy superhero. I just think it should have been more of everything. More gruffyman, more pr-works, more cleanhero. The plot would have deserved 150minutes. Being as it were I just felt a little cheated when after what felt like the prelude to me suddenly the ending credits kicked in. It was a really nice movie but way too short. So I'm kinda looking forward for the sequel but the great chance to work out what should have been the main theme of this movie - how everything depends on good PR has been missed and I can't imagnie how it could be reworked in a possible Hancock II.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Superman with an attitude?  I don't think so.,"The special effects are quite intriguing. The problem is: this movie, like most Hollywood potboilers, is devoid of any intellectual content. In other words, this movie verges on the brink of outright banality. Not good, not bad, not anything. Why even make this movie? Why not a cartoon instead? Now the movie's main character is supposed to be a hero. Okay, let's talk about heroes. On June 6, 1944, American soldiers invaded Europe on the coast of northern France at a place called Normandy Beach. Their objective: to establish a beach head and begin the liberation of Europe from Nazism. Everyone of those valiant soldiers who participated in that historic event were heroes. So there is no need to for Hollywood to make up heroes. All one has to do is read history books and you will find all the heroes, villains, good guys, and bad guys you want. This movie is proof that Hollywood is now stretching the Superman genre to its limits. Superman with an attitude? Duh. By the way, as good an actor as Will Smith is, he is no Christopher Reeve, or George Reeves for that matter, and Mr. Reeve WAS a hero - a real life hero.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Near the end i thought he was gonna die, because of his wife being the same as him, i was happy he didn't.I'm defiantly gonna buy this when it comes out on DVD, if you have not seen this yet, SEE IT.Your gonna miss out on a big block-buster movie, 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Childish and boring,"""Hancock"" is a dull, predictable, and formulaic American action film filled with costly destructive scenes, explosions, and weapon glorification. The plot is easily foreseeable, leaving no room for surprise or engagement, even for those not paying close attention. The twists are poorly written and executed briefly. The entire film is monotonous, tedious, and uninteresting. The accompanying music suits the typical American family movie style.The story feels repetitive and typical, lacking meaningful solutions and featuring feeble dialogues. The visuals could be enjoyable if not overwhelmed by excessive destruction. The action scenes come off as childish, resembling a poorly choreographed playtime. They are particularly disappointing, disorienting, and irritating. The film would be much better without the emphasis on action and destruction.Furthermore, all action scenes contradict each other, making them incongruous within the film. The editing and cinematography are acceptable but not exceptional. The cast delivers a mediocre performance with no standout elements. The acting itself is average, relying heavily on physical strength to solve every issue, rendering the plot's twists meaningless and foreseeable.Watching it was an ordeal.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Why does everyone hate?,"Personally, people judge these movies based on what happens that could ruin the movie. I watched this movie expecting some lame attempt at a superhero movie, and I received a bit of a shock. Yes, this superhero wasn't in a comic or published 50 years ago, but the movie had great twists and turns throughout the film that kept me edging on my seat. I never once thought the filming or idea of the story was far-fetched, just like i never thought Peter Parker getting bit by a radioactive spider was far-fetched. With new ideas, you have to open your mind to possibilities, and this one brought a great idea to the lime light and succeeded. Now a sequel would be going to far for this one, but I would purchase this movie because it was so good. You'll like it if you can open your mind to possibilities. Not comparable to batman, but what is? 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
a SUPER-disappointing movie,"I have never been more sorely disappointed with a film in my entire life. Peter Berg apparently didn't to know who he made the movie for as parts seem geared toward a younger demographic (Will Smith doing ridiculous things that are cartoonish and physically impossible) while other moments are quite adult (certain scenes border on an R-rating). These elements would be fine if Hancock were purely and action movie for grown-ups or a light-hearted comedy for the whole family, but it just doesn't work trying to have them both in the same film. Also, the comedy just didn't ""click"" for me, it seemed out of place and childish, and the entire role of the guy from Arrested Development (an AWFUL show in my opinion) didn't need to be there - and the same goes for Charlize Theron's character. The shaky cam was distracting, the characters were unlikable (other than Hancock), the story was whack, and as with I am Legend, the Fresh Prince is the only saving grace, but unlike that movie, the depths of his acting talent cannot save a movie that is this broken. Worst of all, the best scenes were in the trailers, making them more entertaining to watch than the actual thing - I almost asked my friends if they wanted to walk out. The one good thing in it - the action - does not last nearly long enough to warrant the rest of the picture. Do yourself a favor, even if you love Will Smith, and save your money. Check this website before watching another Will Smith movie, and never see another one of Peter Berg's messes.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Saw this in 2020,"It's a complete different taste and experience of a super hero movie. It's simple, easy on brains and a super binge watch flick. Nothing fancy like MCU movies a good watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sub-Par Superhero,"I must admit, when I first saw the trailer I did not have much of an expectation for this film. My view did not change when I walked in to see this film. However since the film was dubbed as a ""comedy superhero film"" I thought I was at least going to be entertained. Despite the good strong start on this year's summer blockbuster films, Hancock is one of the most mediocre and least entertaining of all.The plot follows an unconventional superhero by the name of Hancock. Despite his heroics, he often lays a wave of property destruction during his act. One day, he rescues a doomed PR from being hit by a train. This begin a change to Hancock's life as Ray (The PR) attempts to change the public's view on Hancock.The film's structure is somewhat similar to the Adam Sandler's film Clicks. The first half is mainly comedy and the second part is mainly drama. I personally enjoyed this system because it prevented the film from being dragging on and kept things pretty interesting.One of the key highlights of this film is Jason Bateman. He is one of the few actor in this film that provides a good and solid performances. Similarly, he is also one of the few likable characters in the film. This leads to the negatives of Hancock...One of the obvious problems with this film is the special effects. Not one of the scenes where special effects are used look convincing in anyway. After Iron Man and other films that were able to present excellent and believable special effects, it is very disappointing.Secondly, the humor isn't so great. A lot of the jokes are present in the trailer and the running gags throughout the film isn't all that funny. Considering that I didn't find this movie that funny made the much more serious second part to be a lot more enjoyable.Finally, the plot is full of plot holes and paper thin. Many things are left unexplained and the film's attempts to create multiple story lines does not work in the slightest.Overall Hancock is definitely not worth the 10 dollars price of admission. It is very forgettable and doesn't impress much. Save your money for The Dark Knight.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Missed opportunity to really spoof the superhero genre,"Hancock tells the story of a man with superpowers who helps people get out of trouble, but he does it with such a negative attitude and reckless disregard of whatever collateral damage it causes that he is hated by almost everybody instead of being celebrated. By chance, he ends up saving the life of an idealistic image consultant who wants to repay the favor by rehabilitating his image. He achieves a measure of success, but then it turns out that the image consultant's wife is not who she seems to be.I am generally not a fan of superhero movies for a philosophical reason. I feel many (but perhaps not all) of these convey a fundamentally disempowering message: instead of taking charge of your life and your problems, wait and hope for some hero to come along and save the day, while you stick your head in the metaphorical sand that these escapist fantasies represent, and, most importantly, continue to consume.Interpreted this way, superhero movies are the ultimate corporatist feel-good drug, and I see the domination of this genre of today's movie business as a sign of societal ill health.To be sure, a superhero movie every now and then is not a problem at all, but this genre has proliferated (or should I say metastasized?) so much that we are now at a point at which real-life people can get lost in imaginary universes.I decided to watch HANCOCK because I understood it to be a spoof of superhero movies, and it would have been refreshing to see a film that lampoons the darker side of this genre which many people do not even seem to notice.There is spoofing going on in the first hour, alright, but unfortunately it is at the most superficial of levels.We get a superhero with an attitude problem and a PR guy who basically teaches him fakeness and insincerity, for example, persuading him to tell people ""good job"" even when it is completely undeserved.We get, just like in regular superhero movies, blatant product placements which reinforce the primary message of this type of movie, which compressed to three words, is ""hope and consume"".We get a scene in which the superhero, in a vulnerable moment, is told ""you are a hero"", and apparently the back-up plan of the Gods to save the rest of us. Far from spoofing the fundamental disempowering message of this entire genre, this film expresses and reinforces it more clearly than most of the movies it supposedly lampoons!(Incidentally, the ""slap that was heard around the world"", which as of this writing just happened a few days ago, may just be an indication of how people who engage in this elitist garbage messaging let it get to their head.)We get a shot at the very end of the moon literally plastered with a trademark, and this is supposed be a stand-in for performing actual good deeds. It is hard to think of a more obvious way to symbolize just how morally bankrupt the entire concept behind this movie is.But setting these philosophical quarrels aside, the ""spoof"" portion of the movie does have some mildly amusing moments. The real problems for the film, considered purely as an entertainment vehicle, begin with a plot twist about two-thirds into it, after which the film ceases to be a spoof and becomes the real thing.Simply, the twist makes no sense, and even worse, to try to make it work, the characters have to behave in an extremely stupid manner multiple times!Tacked on to this is a fake tragic ending which turns into a happy one (I mean, were you surprised?) for literally no reason whatsoever! Could the screenwriters not have come up with at least some semblance of a reason for why a supposedly dead guy suddenly gets up again? Really?Philosophically, the film is disgusting and even just considered purely as entertainment it is subpar, unless you don't mind having your intelligence insulted.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hancock review from http://deusexmachinafilm.blogspot.com,"FOR MORE REVIEWS VISIT http://deusexmachinafilm.blogspot.com Albeit rather clichéd and horribly over-pitched in it's marketing campaign, 'Hancock' is not your average superhero movie. It has its darker elements, it has its more comedic moments, it focuses on character far more than most and forgoes the lengthy final fight sequence that ordinarily typifies the genre. Will Smith is John Hancock, a down-and-out drunk with anger management problems and super-human powers, however he has no idea where he got them from or any idea how to use them responsibly. It is only when he meets PR consultant Ray (Jason Bateman) and his wife Mary (Charlize Theron) that he begins to realise that it might be time to improve his image and turn his life around.Will Smith is a very rare entity, an actor who almost guarantees box-office success yet also providing performances that make the Academy sit up and take notice. At first glance, Hancock may not have seemed one of the most enticing of Hollywood's outputs this summer, but when one realises that it is Smith at the helm then all that changes - such is the likability and staunch proficiency that he yields. It is tough to imagine anyone else playing John Hancock once you have seen Smith's portrayal, and nigh on impossible to imagine anyone playing him any better. He finely balances the drunken, bitter and sarcastic Hancock with the more dependable hero he will inevitably become, whilst hints of the earlier (arguably more interesting) side of Hancock's personality remain throughout.Wry humour perpetually crackles through Hancock's crude dialogue; whether it be his interaction with children, criminals, cops or his supporting cast - Theron and Bateman. Scenes between Bateman and Smith particularly sparkle, their mismatch relationship is established early and works an absolute treat. Bateman's role is reminiscent of his character in Arrested Development, Michael Bluth, imbued with an awkward naivety and will to do good, so hats off to the casting director for their choice here. Theron is initially slightly less convincing as Bateman's wife who is less than thrilled to meet Hancock, but as the story unwinds she improves vastly as the script and plot gives her potential to do so (answering any questions as to her earlier performance along the way).'Hancock' is thoroughly grounded in the real world, far more than any other superhero movie to date, and the only point when this aspect actually lets the film down is in the villain department. There is no Green Goblin here, no Joker, Magneto or even a Lex Luther...all we are given is a few thugs and a bank robber with ideas above his station. For some, this may ruin the film as there is no obligatory half-hour, city-destroying, climactic sequence between the hero and his nemesis, for others (myself included) this may be a welcome change. Instead we have a carefully structured plot, slowly revealing the truth behind who Hancock is what he must do to make the transition to archetypal hero. The back-story to Hancock is fascinating and the twist in the tale propels the story into its final act just as you may be beginning to wonder whether it has run out of steam.What could have been a parody/farce similar to 'My Super Ex-Girlfriend' has been transformed into a thoroughly entertaining watch via a script with fresh ideas and top-notch performances. Where some will criticise it for fraying the edges between being a lightweight action-comedy and a more orthodox superhero flick, I would praise it for blending these two facets superbly and maintaining its edge of originality. The closing sequences may be a bit of an anti-climax, but this, thankfully, is not enough to knock Hancock off his stride.Verdict: Possibly mis-marketed and as a result of which Hancock will surprise you - in a good way. Will Smith, yet again, does not disappoint. FOUR STARS OUT OF FIVE",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What happened?,"I have a totally different opinion about this movie. I instead think that the first half of the movie was the better half. Simply because it had a lot more humor and better storytelling.What didnÂ't I like about this movie? well, first of I didnÂ't like the directing, it was way to shaky and confusing for this kind of movie. I allso felt that the script was very empty, they could have builded more on the character of Hancock instead of showing of effects that doesn't even look good IMO. The dialogue was flat as well and the plot was so short it felt that it was over too fast.As I said the second half of the movie takes a totally new direction and its over before you have anytime to get it in. Will Smith is a good actor, he plays the role relatively well, although its probably not a very hard role to play (Im not saying anything).To sum it all up Hancock is another of the movies that will entertain you. But certainly nothing youÂ'll remember in 10 years. it, like all movies released right now, falls into the shadow of The Dark Knight (ThatÂ's a nice line) and don't leave me touched at all. Sorry Smith, but youÂ've done better.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An unlikely superhero in an un-superhero-like movie,"John Hancock is far from your average superhero, but the trailer told you that. What the trailer doesn't tell you, is that after the rogue anti-hero drunkenly parades about as advertised, he has to develop a backstory and make the film go from a clever spin on a hot- ticket genre to an emotional action drama. There are entertaining and unique elements that make ""Hancock"" standout, but they end up secondary to a hodge-podge and two-faced plot concept.It's easy to be deceived these days by the shear unruly star-power that is Will Smith, especially when he's attached to a project dealing with superheroes, a genre that has been a cash machine. He's talented no matter what he does, and in that regard, ""Hancock"" is enjoyable. While I personally felt his character was too much of an a**hole as the script so frequently and unoriginally puts it, that doesn't mean Smith isn't good at it. He's just a great hero no matter the film.To quickly summarize, Smith plays ""Hancock,"" a lonely, drunken jerk with Superman powers and a public approval rating of zero. When he saves Ray's (Jason Bateman) life, Ray offers his services as a P.R. consultant and the two work to change his image. Eventually, you get to Hancock's back story and some strange but obvious twists take the film down a different path that to explain would be a major spoiler.So from the perspective of a producer that has a decent script with a highly marketable concept written by some nobodies and with a director (Peter Berg) attached whose best action credit is 2007's ""The Kingdom,"" I would definitely want to sign someone to play Hancock who is going to guarantee me top spot at the box office. Well, voila. Smith is such a proved commodity with an amazing streak of top first weekend box office spots that he could get any contract he wants and he should do that.After Smith, the marks for ""Hancock"" are pretty much middle of the road. The CGI and Berg's directing style is too sloppy for what should be a clean-cut summer blockbuster. His refusal to use any camera stabilizing device works for a few scenes, but most of the time it's just dizzying and the close-ups become obnoxious. The plot concept, which paints a picture of Hancock as a hero and then fills it in with the origin story later instead of the other way around, makes for an interesting affect, but instead of enlightening what we know about Hancock, it ends up taking the film in another direction entirely. While you might think this movie would leave you with themes about turning one's life around and becoming the best you can be, that gets glossed over and you're left themeless.If you want summer fun at the movies that is about as clumsy, destructive and amusing as the title character is, you should check out ""Hancock."" ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Will Smith does it again!,"I have always said that Will Smith is one of the best actors in Hollywood. He was great in the Men in Black series, I am Legend, and Independence Day. He was no different in this movie. This movie not about the superhero you expect. In fact, the superhero is exactly the opposite of a normal one. Will Smith's character is a drunk hero who contemplates suicide. Then with the advice of Ray Embrey, played by Jason Bateman, Hancock decides to turn a new leaf. But Embrey's wife adds a big mystery to the whole movie. The acting is great. I already talked about Will Smith but Charlize Theron and Jason Bateman were excellent cast choices. The action is fantastic. You never expect what would happen in the opening sequences. The music by John Powell goes well with the film. Overall, this is a great, must-see-again action film. My words of advice for this movie is do not listen to the negative reviews. I rate this movie 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Do we really need ANOTHER superhero movie?,"As if we do not have enough superhero movies already with the steady flow of umpteen sequels and still new ones in the works (Ant-Man is due out in 2010, I wonder what will be next Larva-Man?), someone had to create a completely new, original 2008 superhero with no comic book pastHancock. Even with three strong performances, the film collapses from its' poor start and even worse end finale.Will Smith has the title role of Hancock, a one-of-a-kind superhuman who works with the LAPD to catch criminals. Well, at least he is supposed to but he has become an alcoholic to deal with his constant mood of depression, and his inebriated antics have caused millions of dollars in damages to Los Angeles City. All of which has caused him to fallout out of the public's favor. Enter Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) a PR consultant who wants to help him repair his image. Before long, well actually almost immediately, Hancock agrees, and the two form an unlikely duo. The finale comes rather abruptly with one of the most surprising, confusing finale that is what ultimately ruins Hancock.All three talented stars (Will Smith, Jason Bateman, and Charlize Theron) play their parts entertainingly well, but the story, script, direction, and camera work are what destroy it. The film clocks in at 92 minutes, leaving no time for character development and all the events happen so quickly and abruptly that it feels like an extended TV episodes with gazillion-dollar effects.Another thing that I found particularly annoying was this constant ""shaky"", close-ups of who ever was in the scene. Almost as if the studio was trying to save money on set design so they kept the camera in really tight.Once again the time and effort was put into wowing the audience with the special effects, which are quite remarkable, rather than entertaining with a strong story and developed characters. I would not even recommend it as brainless entertainment because it was rather boring. I still wonder why someone felt the need to go and create ANOTHER superhero movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The beginning of the film is extremely boring, when Hancock is put into prison, but when he gets out, the film becomes as i said mildly entertaining.This isn't no exaggeration this is one of the worst films Will Smith has ever been involved in, its really not worth going to the cinema for, maybe check it out on the internet if you would like to be mildly entertained if not go and watch Deal or No Deal instead.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A very good but different superhero movie,"Hancock was a very funny movie with lots of action. The visuals in this movie were very cool. The special effects were very good as expected. I think they were better then in some other superhero movies. It was a very different superhero movie. Hancock was a very different, drunk, mean, smelly superhero. The twists in this movie were very good. They were kind of pretty obvious and others were unexpected. The direction of this movie was great. Will Smith was a good actor as he usually is. He had very good moments in this. He was definitely funnier than you would expect. The best thing about him was he didn't try to be funny he just was. This was probably the best action comedy movie made since Rush Hour. This movie has a very high budget for a very short movie. It was funny how all of the kids loved Hancock, but most parents all hated him. Charlize Therron was very pretty and had some good scenes. Will Smith and her and many funny, action, and dramatic scenes together. I think the movie remained pretty consistent all the way through. If anything it got a little better toward the end of the movie. I also thought the story was really good and didn't give anything away until the end. Just know going into this movie you have to be aware it is very far-fetched and very fake. So don't read the other reviews that say how fake and dumb this movie was. It was very fun and entertaining to watch. I would even go see it again maybe to catch anything I missed.

A huge missed opportunity.,"The initial premise had a lot of potential
for success and with the lovable and charismatic Will Smith in the leading role, it could have led to a truly unique and memorable superhero movie. Unfortunately, while the movie does initially seem to know what it's doing and even offers some solid laughs, it takes a nosedive in quality and completely shifts it's gears in a matter of seconds around the half way point. As a result, what could have been a much simpler but way more impactful story about a reckless hero trying to be a better person for both himself and others, turns into a needlessly convoluted mess that ultimately amounts to nothing.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I must agree to many comments summarizing it as Superhero yet Human. Charlez Theron looks hot in her sequences, perhaps could have opened her character at least a little in initial reels.The pace and the humor on the proceedings are spot on, arguably there are very few talented stars with the impeccable comic timing, as Will Smith, portrays on screen.Its a must watch even if you loved superhero movies or even hated them.
