Leaves you pining for '11',"Three years ago Danny Ocean (Clooney) and his team stole 160 million dollars from Terry Benedict (Garcia). Now Benedict wants his money back. Plus interest. Thus Ocean and his crew must scramble together what they owe; too hot to work in America, they set their sights on Amsterdam.... where, not so coincidently, Rusty Ryan (Pitt) has an ex-love (Zeta-Jones) who just so happens to be head of police and hot on their trail. But Benedict and sexy cop Isabel Lahiri (Zeta-Jones) aren't the crew's only problem. Another thief under the alias of ""nightfox"" ( Vincent Cassel) is keen to battle it out with Ocean and his team; to decide who the best thief (or thieves) are.And there you have Ocean's 12; a film which falls too short in terms of wit, appearance, plot... and pretty much everything else in comparison to the original Ocean's 11.One thing must be made clear, however; the cast is great. Spectacular really. There is a definite and rare chemistry between everyone; even Catherina Zeta-Jones, newcomer to the Soderbergh film. And it is indeed very rare to jam-pack a film with so many big name celebs without the film being ruined by too much star power and not enough of anything else. And these films do indeed have A lot of Hollywood star power in them; Julia Roberts, George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Catherina Zeta Jones, Bernie Mac, Andy Garcia, Don Cheadle... just to name the biggest names. And watching Ocean's 11, you can tell that the crew enjoyed making this film. Unfortunately, the audience may not gain the same pleasure as the actors did....If you were like me, absolutely blown away by the chic and jazzy first film, then Ocean's 12 will be a disappointment. The first movie was simply 'classy'. All of the shots, every single take, camera angles were all very clean-cut, solid and very stylish. In this film however, Soderbergh decides to use the currently popular 'shaky cam' technique for some scenes. I can understand why. In this film, unlike the first one, the crew haven't had time to plan to perfection their 'pull'. In this film its a mad rush to meet Benedict's deadline and I suppose Soderbergh wanted to get that rashness and disorientation across. But it wrecks the film. He really should have stuck to his original idea of having it all snazzy, bold and clean. Plus it is confusing when the film snaps between past and present to explain how the crew made some of their robberies; it looks messy and ugly to change between shaky cam to the bolder scenes.Secondly, the laughs are fewer in 12 and the script is duller. Ocean's 11 had a quick-wit and many a memorable line. Ocean's 12 has to sink so low as to throw in an age joke for Clooney; ""Do i look 50?"". The plot is predictable; from Julia Robert's 'impersonation' to the crew's great escape. It's all very blunt and can be spotted a mile away. And the summing up of the 'pull' is a little confusing; past tense (there's that shaky cam again!). I cant give too much away but my personal opinion is that the explanation of how the team pulled of the robbery is a little confusing and a sort of ""huh""? moment which you will need to disucss with other's who have seen the film, to make sure you absolutely understood everything.All in all the film is a let down. By all means go and see it; if for no other reason than to drool over the gorgeous Matt Damon, Brad Pitt and George Clooney.... But do not get your hopes up. As the credits roll you will find yourself feeling cheated somehow. Ocean's 11 was a real gem but Ocean's 12 just leaves you pining for the original.... 5.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Ocean's Twelve: 6/10,"It's inevitable, isn't it? After the success of the remake of Ocean's Eleven, out comes the sequel three years later. I liked the style of the teaser trailer (and was probably one of the only ones who didn't mind the name), so naturally, I was looking forward to the movie. Naturally, it's a sequel, so it's inferior to the original (which I liked more than the original of the original). The entire cast is back (plus one more, obviously) for the necessary foreign-country locations and trendy scene transitions. There's the constant music, the people with the general European accents (well, villains), and every other caper movie cliché in the books.Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his eleven/twelve compadres are forced to pay back the money that they stole from Terry Benedict's (Andy Garcia) casinos three years earlier. To get the money, they have to steal it in Europe.Where the first movie was fun, this sequel was mildly entertaining. It went on a little long, but was never boring. It's watchable (as all crime movies like these should be), but not really entertaining. I wasn't having fun while watching a lot of Ocean's Twelve. I wasn't bored, either. I was in Limbo of the movie world. All of the Vegas glitz added to the first, and here it's drab European backgrounds. Steven Soderbergh's directing also makes the film harder to enjoy. The film's choppy-we don't see events that happened until after the fact (if that makes any sense), and there are so many subplots and characters with similar sounding names that eventually we stop caring. Whenever a movie makes me do that, I usually focus more in on the fun aspects of the movie. And sure, the movie had its fun moments, and never left me bored, but overall, it just lacked that ultra-cool style that the first one had.Then again, every actor's back in cool form. Catherine Zeta-Jones is the newbie here, and although her character is barely defined, she still manages to be cool. George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt (being on screen probably more than anyone else), Matt Damon-they're all cool. But it's obvious that this isn't the best sequel that could have been made for Ocean's Eleven-the movie was originally written for a completely different movie, and then readapted to a sequel. Because of that, there aren't really any reminders on who these people were. I remembered Clooney, Roberts, Garcia, and a few character names and quirks (such as Pitt's obsessive eating), but, really, who were these people? Did Soderbergh think that we would all rush out to see the first one before seeing this? I'll bet as many people did that as the number who went to see the Russian Solyaris after Soderbergh made Solaris.The caper this time around isn't as interesting (the major one doesn't come in until halfway through), nor as easy to follow. In fact, the whole movie's basically a convoluted mess. The subplot about Isabel's father, things like that...if there's a definition of worthless, that's it. Also, that ""Julia Roberts"" bit went on for too long. We got the joke there. At that moment, I think that the movie thought it was funny enough to abandon basically the entire plot and go with a ten minute schtick, when there was basically no other humor in the movie. Still, Ocean's Twelve isn't terrible, and can offer a good time if you're the right person.My rating: 6/10 Rated PG-13 for language.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
a mistake,"Three years after Ocean's Eleven the gang's all back for more in this sequel. This time around the elusive group of thieves and con artists reunite and travel abroad to Europe to try and pull off another elaborate heist after vengeful casino mogul Terry Benedict (García) tracks them down looking for reimbursement. Little do they dream that they'll face stiff competition from a self-proclaimed criminal mastermind (Cassel) who's determined to try and upstage them. The latest in a long line of tepid Hollywood sequels; the cast may have had fun making this film but that doesn't mean the audience will as it drags on for over two hours with endless story lulls, self-conscious humor, and banal dialogue. One particularly embarrassing in-joke falls flat and leaves you wondering just how desperate the producers were to earn cheap laughs. The same group of gifted actors that made the original so special are wasted here, as the needlessly inextricable ""script"" lacks any wit, style, or sense of purpose. **",,Anonymous,Crime
"I think the cast had a better time on this one than the public has, or maybe I just hope so","I went to this movie, not expecting much. Actually I didn't even intend to go, since I thought it would be a crap movie, but you know how it is when a friend of yours wants to go to the movies with you. SOmetimes it's just hard to pick a movie. I had coincidentally seen quite a few cinematic releases recently, he doesn't like Jim Carrey (Series of unfortunate Events) and the rest of the films are even more unappealing than Ocean's Twelve (Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, Alexander, The Grudge or some stupid dutch film like Floris). What do you do then? You settle for the lesser evil: Ocean's Twelve! Finally when you go to the cinema with expectations that low, you sometimes are surprised at how good the film actually is. Too bad Ocean's Twelve isn't one of them. I actually felt that the whole first hour of the film was pretty bad. It could have been much tighter, even in the beginning. I mean, why make the part with Benedict all so lengthy when god knows there are telephones and Danny Ocean is the leader. But that's not the main problem with this film. I mean while it is fun to see all the characters from the first film in action and the whole deal Julia Roberts in the hotel are well-meant the entire film has nothing of the adventure of the first. There is no excitement, no suspense, even no sexual tension between any of the characters.I can see what the story is here, but it is just too elaborate and there are too many different set-up's. The whole thing is filmed in a very uninvolved and non-thrilling way, which is exasperated (I've seen Shaun of the dead as well!) by the fact that many to all of the heists and set-up's are revealed after they have already been made. Also: why set up another heist when you could set up Benedict again? The makers of the film clearly want to make you think they do it because they itch. Well make it clearer and more obvious to see. For I do not believe it after seeing this film.When criticizing this movie, one has to include the cast and I must say that overall I was pretty disappointed with it. George Clooney didn't have any charisma this time around as Danny 'smooth operator' Ocean , Andy Garcia wasn't quite mean enough, I can't figure out why Bernie Mac was in the film and as already mentioned. So far as to doing you job badly. The rest of the cast was only mediocre, with the exception of Matt Damon, Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts who did OK. Considering Vincent Cassel, I just thought he was miscast and the entire character structure was crap. I mean an adversary to THE GANG should have been much different than the character he played and his whole scheme and and his whole set-up could have been much more believable. No matter how mediocre I thought the acting was, it is not my intention to slam the actors here, for much of the blame can be allocated to the writers and the director.Is there nothing good then here? Well, of course there are some nice moments in the film and it makes you smile at times. Of course it isn't a total snooze-fest and not utterly boring, but it compared to it's predecessor it really is A LOT worse. I'd actually given this one only a 5 out of 10, but because of some nice bits and that tad of charme that shine through at times I'll be gentle this time.6 out of 10post scriptum: please no Ocean's 13 or Ocean's 10 / Ocean's 9 (after one or two members of the crew have been kidnappedI BEG YOU !!!!!!!!!!Note: this review has been amended to remove some sexist comments I included at the time.

Great Cast and Budget Wasted in an Awful Screenplay and Terrible Direction,"The 2001 remake of Lewis Milestone's ""Ocean's Eleven"" is a good adventure, with action, comedy and thriller in an updated screenplay. When this sequel was released, I was impressed with the number of stars and locations mostly in Europe, and certainly a huge budget. Unfortunately, this movie does not have the most relevant component: a decent screenplay. The beginning is confused and most of the situations and dialogs are not funny, being indeed ridiculous; when the execution of the heist is disclosed in the end, it is ludicrous; and the absurd plot itself is totally unbelievable and does not work. The direction is also very bad, with horrible and weird movements of camera. Steven Soderbergh began his career with exceptional works, but his last films are very deceptive (""Full Frontal""(2002); ""Solaris""(2002)). My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Doze Homens e Outro Segredo"" (""Twelve Men and Other Secret"")",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Self-referential: see ""self-referential""","Ocean's Twelve works for me because it's self-referential; in other words, it plants its tongue firmly in its cheek, and scatters references through the film to the real life people/situations behind the film. I can't tell you how without bringing down the wrath of the IMDb spoiler police on my head, but let's say that if you enjoy Hitchcock cameos or the humour of films such as Star Trek IV (""Computer? Computer!""), you should like this one.It's also refreshing to see a film that treats Europe as being more than Big Ben, the Eiffel Tower and the Colosseum. I actually watched it in Rome, one of the locations used in the film, and not a single ancient ruin appeared (apart from George Clooney ;->); indeed, the opening scene of a line of cars all sounding their horns was familiar enough to send a laugh around the Roman audience.There were one or two plot oddities that'll probably show up in the IMDb goofs section (Arsenal FC going from Amsterdam to Barcelona?! By bus?!) but overall, a good night out.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Too clever for it's own good.,"A heist movie works on the premise that the audience is in on the heist. We dread the incredible security measures. We get to see the planning and the development. We marvel at the skills of each expert. We experience the same suspense and drama as the characters. Ocean's Twelve discards all these elements in favor of creative editing, avant garde camera work and superficial writing. It tries to extract great performances from so-so actors. O.K. so they all are beautiful people. That doesn't mean they are automatically the best actors. It doesn't mean that they can carry a film on their performances. Clooney and Pitt are no Newman and Redford. The acting talents of Catherince Zeta-Jones have never been anything to write home about. Only Finney in a tiny cameo draws any real emotion from the audience.The best heist movies have real suspense. This film has none. The outcome is never in doubt. No matter how the surface of the plan is seemingly foiled...everyone is in on the far deeper ""actual"" plan.On major problem is Garcia's character.If the original ""11"" successfully pulled off the job we are made to believe they did in the first film, they wouldn't panic and crumble like a house of cards to Benedict's pressure and scare tactics. In fact, once a member of the cadre had been contacted, survelliance would have captured Benedict's strong arm tactics and bellicose threats immediately. The man would have legal challenges beyond belief.It's not enough to know who robbed you. You must have proof, otherwise the worst threats would be a laughing matter for seasoned pros.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
a delightfully inventive artsy masterpiece,"When I heard there was going to be a sequel to Ocean's Eleven, I thought ""oh great, just another way for Hollywood to squeeze all the money it can out of an old idea."" But when I saw it my jaw dropped. This is not as good as the first, it far surpasses it.I for one thought the cinematography was brilliant, the most inventive there has been for quite a while. This is a feast for the eyes, a veritable banquet of colour and imagery, with Europe as it's perfect backdrop.The writing was superb. Far from the confusing mess I have heard it described as, the plot is rich and full, with enough meat to keep the mind well active as it is being entertained. The movie was smart and funny without taking itself too seriously (e.i. Julia Roberts pretending to be herself). The situations were, at times, unbelievable even absurd, but what point is there in a movie that does not stretch the bonds of reality just a little bit. If you want real life sit on a street corner and observe.The music was prefect for the movie, in stuck the exact right chords in the exact right places. it fit in to the over all feel of whimsy that was prominent through out film.As for the acting, there was no weak link. Matt Damon in particular was fantastic. I love the seen in the restaurant were Pitt and Clooney are talking in a fake code, Damon did exactly what he was suppose to do and produced a adorable, lovable character, without taking it too far, or taking himself too seriously. My advice to you is, if you want a typical mainstream movie, better save your money for Pirates of the Caribbean 2, but if you want a delightfully inventive artsy masterpiece Ocean's twelve is the one for you.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Lazy sequel that insults not only the audience, but everyone involved in the movie.","The scene between Danny, Rusty, Linus, and Matsui where Danny and Rusty laugh uncomfortably at Matsui's gibberish joke says it all. Everyone in this movie expected us to enjoy whatever was put in front of us, because this is just a ""safe picture"", as Matt Damon's boyfriend would say would say. So, what went wrong? There are so many obvious in-jokes, cheap jokes, leaps of logic that even die hard Ocean's Eleven fans should feel cheated. The f**k scene with Basher is a good example of the sledgehammer type of joking this movie expects us to swallow graciously. These stars think that we are so involved with them that all they need to do is show us that they can make fun of themselves. I don't know the name of Julia Roberts' daughter; and I don't care. All those scenes with Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis are painful in their smugness. This movie feels like a bunch of friends got together and decided, on a whim, to make a movie. Steven Soderbergh should get full marks for making Ocean's Eleven work and full blame for this sequel. He should have told everyone to work first and play second.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Neither awful nor amazing...,"I went into 'Oceans 12' as being a big fan of the first installment, but my hopes were not astronomical. And for the two or so hours that I watched the movie, I was not disappointed. However, I cannot say that I enjoyed it nearly as much as I had enjoyed 'Oceans 11'.'Oceans 12' was a very fun, but at the same time flawed, movie. The movie was every film students dream come true, full of indie style camera and editing tricks from beginning to end. But this could not hide the fact that at its core it was still a studio movie. The storyline was entertaining and full of just as many twists and turns as had graced the first one. However, when the final credits rolled I could not help but wonder about some of the loose ends (and there were many). It almost felt as though the scriptwriter had too many ideas that really did not fit with one another, but he threw them in anyway. At times it could be a little frustrating and leave you wondering why they even showed the last ten minutes of the movie.By far the strong suit of the film was the cast and their generally above par performances. Brad Pitt was excellent again, and Matt Damon was probably even better then he had been in '11'. The rest of the gang was about as they had been previously, with the possible exception of Shaobo Qin whom I felt was even funnier this time around. Catherine Zeta Jones turned out to be a welcome addition and she fit right in with the movies flow as Pitt's love interest. She perhaps looked the most comfortable in her role out of all of them, despite the fact that it was her first hand in the series.All in all, I was pleased that I had spent the eight dollars to go and see this the day that it opened. But by the same token, I doubt I will be purchasing it when it appears on DVD.My Overall Rating: 6 1/2 out of 10",,Anonymous,Crime

"It's OK, Not Good.","""Ocean's Twelve"" is a mediocre movie. The story is not as interesting as it should be. The cinematography and camera work is normal, but becomes ridiculous at some points. And the background music, well, is just awful! Frankly, the only thing saving the movie is Brad, George, and Julia, doing a well enough performance.I did like the idea of Julia Roberts trying to play Julia Roberts, which was maybe the only thing in this film that can be considered ""creative"". And Bruce Willis' short part was also enjoyable to watch. But everything else is just boring.There is way too many plot twists, it honestly reminded me of Rick and Morty's S4E3(One Crew over the Crewcoo's Morty). I now think maybe that episode was directly ridiculing this movie.But overall, it was fun to watch.

"Falls Short of Its Predecessors, Still Entertains","Ocean's Twelve, the second installment in the Ocean's series, doesn't quite live up to the high bar set by its predecessors, earning a 6/10. While it retains the stylish charm and star-studded cast of the first film, it lacks some of the original's cohesion and flair.One of the challenges with Ocean's Twelve is its attempt to replicate the success of the first film without bringing enough new elements to the table. The plot feels somewhat convoluted, and the heist lacks the straightforward excitement of Ocean's Eleven. This sequel tries to up the ante with more complex schemes and locations, but in doing so, it sometimes loses the simplicity that made the first film so engaging.Despite these shortcomings, Ocean's Twelve still offers moments of fun and entertainment. The chemistry among the ensemble cast remains strong, and there are flashes of the wit and humor that characterized the original. The European settings add a new aesthetic dimension, giving the film a different flavor.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Just one thing tough : why is Catherine Zeta Jones' an actress??? She is always BAD and Ocean's Twelve confirms it!!! They also push a little too much with Julia Roberts' part, it's a little too risky, and honestly, it does not really worked for me. It's a little incoherent at the end. It opens way too much on something we're no sure about. Globally, I can't believe the ideas! It's never boring and quite funny.

Actually a little disappointing,"I decided to watch this not long after watching the first one. And I have to say I'm actually a little disappointed in this one. I really enjoyed the first so I had good expectations for this. And it backfired on me.So I want to start by saying it's not a bad film by any stretch. But, in comparison to what it could have been it's not great either. So my main issue with this is quite simply the writing. I just don't think it flowed well enough and the pace of the film was generally pretty slow throughout.This film lacked that ""wow"" factor that the first film had as well. We got to witness this whole heist go down and that's what made everything fall into place and it's what made that film great. But, you don't get that this time round and the ""heist"" is incredibly underwhelming. I found the characters a little underwhelming also. The first film introduced them really well and they all illustrated certain quirks. This film really didn't show any of that anymore and some characters I genuinely forgot about mid film, because they were so spaced out and simply 'not there'.A problem I had with the first instalment is that they tried including a romance storyline line and it just didn't really work. Nor did I care for it. And this went down the same route. I just don't think these kind of storylines are really needed for the type of film that it is.But yeah, I'm just disappointed if anything. I really enjoyed the first and this in comparison is a let down. Like I mentioned before it's not a terrible movie. But there's a lot of room for improvement.

I thought the movie was cool and a lot of fun.,"I saw a sneak preview of 'Ocean's 12' tonight. (I must admit that I haven't seen 'Ocean's 11' yet.) Sure, there are potholes galore: if Ocean can discover the real identity of the 'Night Fox' so quickly, why can the police not do it? And if you start trying to logically connect things (so Rusty just left Isabel one night more than three years ago and she never looked for him and then calmly knocks on his door one day?), you'll get a headache. I know that the odd camera angles and abrupt cuts were supposed to give the film an 'edgy' feel, but I found them to be distracting.But I thought the movie was cool and a lot of fun. I love heist movies with double-crosses and such, and 'Ocean's 12' does not disappoint in that area. I love the 1960's-era movie feel that the music really helped portray. Clooney did his usual cool bad guy with a heart of gold, Zeta-Jones and Roberts gave more of the 'lightly scolding, but-I-love-you' act and Brad Pittwell, all he had to do was look directly at the camera and smile. **Sigh.** And I'm not even a fan of his. I thought Andy Garcia had the right amount of menace and charm as the revenge-seeking Benedict. Eliot Gould was terrific (as always!) There is lots of humor and there is a ruse near the end of the movie that involves Julia Roberts' character that I found to be hysterical!

Too disjointed story structure. Tried to be too smart. Never equalled the brilliance of the original.,"They tried to make a great sequel and they failed. BUT nevertheless it is still a mildly enjoyable heist movie, despite being less good than the original Ocean's Eleven, which was absolutely brilliant.The bad: too disjointed story structure. The story basically is a mess and almost incomprehensible and quite silly near the end. There are simply too many scenes that dont add anything to the story. There are 2 villains now instead of one. There are 2 romances now instead of 1. There are 2 heists now instead of 1. Double cross upon double cross. They multiplied everything, they added things and added even more things on top of that, but that made the story only more chaotic and less coherent.

"Lazy and convoluted sequel, saved by the stellar playing of the cast and the efficient direction","I enjoyed Oceans 11, I thought it was quite enjoyable, helped by the performances and the direction. However, I was disappointed with this film. Don't get me wrong, it is not a complete dud, thanks to the stellar performances from Brad Pitt, Catherine Zeta-Jones, George Clooney and Matt Damon especially and the efficient direction from Steven Soderbergh. However, the film really does suffer from truly lethargic pacing, some of the film was so slow I almost fell asleep between one key twist. Second, the plot is very convoluted and there are many twists and turns that makes it hard to keep up. The camera work wasn't as innovative as it was in the first movie either. Whereas in the first movie, it was smooth and professional, it was jerky and awkward here, and the music wasn't particularly memorable. The screenplay also wasn't as witty or as fun, and the film felt anti-climatic. At the end of the day it all felt a bit too lazy, despite the expert playing and direction.

Better than the first,"I don't understand how some people hate this movie. This was one of the few movies that i have ever seen where you have to watch it all the way through. The movie just moves. Unlike other movies, something is always happening. It has the same all star cast as the first one; a better plot line, in my opinion; and, most of all, it has the same heart as the first one. Unlike the new pirates of the Caribbean movie, for example (I liked that movie, it was just the first one that came to mind.) it just seems to have the same feel as the first one. Except this one is much funnier than Oceans 11. Some of the conversations that they had, such as the one between Rusty (Brad Pitt) and Danny (George Clooney) when Danny realized that he had been given a fake wake up call, and then when they got drunk, made me laugh for 5 minutes after the scene had already ended. Also, the movie is much more confusing than the last one, which i like, because that means that you can watch it several times over without getting bored of it. Because of these qualities, and because Eliot Gould had a bigger part, i can say that Oceans 12 was better than the first.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Lacks The Freshness Of The Original And Doesn't Add Anything Of Substance,"Lacking the freshness of the original and going a bit overboard with its twists n turns, the follow-up chapter to Ocean's Eleven does exhibit the lavish look & carefree vibe of its predecessor and adds a couple more charismatic actors to its ensemble but its story is weak and only gets messier as it progresses.Taking place some time after the events of the previous film, Ocean's Twelve brings back all the members of the original team as they battle against time to pay back all the money they stole from the owner of Las Vegas casinos, with interest. To meet the demand, they decide to pull off another heist, however, there's a new player in town.Directed by Steven Soderbergh, the film picks up from where it left off in the last picture and doesn't take long to bring all of them back into the same room. The basic storyline is interesting but how the events unfold in the final print is where the problem arises, not to mention that the subplots relating to new characters don't add anything of significance.The sumptuous look n feel is retained and the European scenery is beautifully photographed. The smart manoeuvring of camera & refined use of colour palette adds a vibrant quality to its images. Editing is a mixed bag, however, as the numerous twists don't carry the same weight and appears forced into the narrative. And the background score doesn't have anything new to add either.Coming to the performances, pretty much the entire cast of Ocean's Eleven make their appearance in this one with Clooney & Pitt leading the pack like before while the new additions include Vincent Cassel & Catherine Zeta-Jones who play their part responsibly but their respective characters are very poorly sketched. Roberts however gets additional screen time and is able to improve on her earlier input.On an overall scale, Ocean's Twelve is an inferior sequel by all means that does take the arcs of its characters a little forward but doesn't add anything of substance. What's also disappointing is the climax that's far more ridiculous this time and seems way far-fetched than it did the last time. Still, there's some fun, laughs & amusement in store but if you're expecting a sequel that improves upon the original, then Ocean's Twelve isn't one of those.",,Anonymous,Crime
A second dose of Cool,"Ocean's 11 was always going to be a tough act to follow. Breaking the remake rules by firstly remaking a pretty bad movie (as opposed to the usual method of going for a good one to remake), and then making it into one of the freshest films of recent years was quite a double whammy. The cast were cool, the story was cool, the setting of Las Vegas was cool, the soundtrack was cool, and the direction was cool. It was, you could say, a cool movie! Well, when all involved said they wanted to do another one (and even took a pay cut to prove that they weren't just in it for the money), fingers were crossed. Could they repeat the success, or would it be a prime example of lightning never striking twice.Ocean's Twelve picks up a few years after events of the last film, with all the band of thieves scattered, and still trying to outrun Casino owner, victim of their heist, Tess's ex, and all round nasty piece of work, Terry Benedict. However, it seems, pretty soon into the film, that Benedict has found them, with the help of a mysterious ally. To appease him, they all need to pay back what they stolewith interest! In order to obtain the cash they must plan another heist. To complicate matters there is the small detail of Rusty's (Pitt) recent ex-girlfriend, Isable (Zeta Jones), an Interpol agent tracking down them, and the mysterious thief The Nightfox, who has a small matter of honor to work out.The film takes around 20 minutes to really get started, and that first 20 minutes will alienate a lot of people who just want to chew popcorn and be excited. The initial set-up doesn't seem to work well, and is what lets this film down. However, for those of you who can keep your attention over this troubled start, what kicks in after that marker is another slice of that cool we were delivered in the first movie. Once Ocean's Twelve hits its stride, it paces along wonderfully, with each scene flowing nicely into the next. The witty dialogue and interplay between the characters is as snappy as before, and you just can't help but get that buzz. This time around Julia Roberts, as Tess, gets her own moment to shine, in a scene which some have criticised for being cheesy, but I thought was immensely fun.All is assisted by the same snappy cut direction, with good use of filters and cuts allowing each scene to bounce along vibrantly to the cool score. Yup, as with the last film, the soundtrack is toe-tappingly good, and adds a colourful energy to the events unfolding on screen.All in all, a damn good attempt at a sequel. Not on par with the first, but I never expected it to be. Let down mainly by that off putting first 20 minutes, but recovers nicely to deliver a good end result.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Audiences don't like being tricked,"I felt cheated out of knowing the whole story. While there could be a twist, this twist was so significant, that I felt betrayed. I believe it could have used a better writer who could weave all the elements of the story together better. The writer could have revealed more of the 'twists' throughout the movie, rather than all at once at the end. That aside, I believe that the actors did very well with what they had, particularly Matt Damon, who actually had a little character in his character, little quirks that weren't egotistic or like a smooth criminal who always knows what he is doing. The other main characters were their own separate entities who just happened to converse with one another. The cohesiveness of the group in Ocean's Eleven was gone.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Mixed,"People are going to hate me for saying this, but I didn't think it was bad. It wasn't as good as the first one, but I still enjoyed it. There are some awkward moments of stilted dialogue and awkward pauses, and at times the plot can be hard to understand, and there is way too much dialogue that really just builds up to nothing. But there were still some moments I found fun. The moments of metahumor and self awareness towards the second half of the film made me laugh, there were still some good action moments. It just wasn't as investing as the first one. It wasn't awful, but it wasn't great.

"Yeah, this one isn't as good as the first.","I know that's pretty blunt, but those were my feelings right after watching it. It's not bad per se, and it definitely has some of the great elements of 'Ocean's Eleven' - mainly the characters and performances. But what mainly lets it down is how overly tangled and messy the plot is. Firstly, for a movie that's posited as a 'heist' film, there's very little actual heisting that's going on on-screen. You only get to see some snippets of a few heists, and in the van der Woude house heist, a lot of the actual heist is just 'sped up'. Secondly, you have the romance subplot between Rusty and the Europol agent, which I found to be quite dull AND it takes up quite a significant amount of screen time. But before I rag on this film too much, there were some things I really liked about it. Like how in one scene, where the 'gang' are discussing the best approach to the van der Woude heist, they talk over each other in a convincing manner - instead of feeling like it's just actors waiting for each other to say a line, it actually sounds like a discussion between real people.But back to what wasn't great about the movie. Much like the first, the editing was bizarre but, to its credit, less so than 'Ocean's Eleven'. The cinematography was really poor in some scenes, looking like an episode of a really low-budget documentary or children's television show. And finally, the soundtrack wasn't nearly as memorable as the first. In general, while it does some things well, it's just too convoluted for its own good and is simply a lesser film than it's predecessor.Overall: 6/10, maybe high 5 or low-mid 6.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
This movie is awesome!!!!,"I went and saw this movie last night and as the first one I loved the second one. The best part is when Tess(Julia Roberts) has to pretend to be herself. And the fact that they pulled it off(I knew they would) and trumped the Italian guy. The scenery of Lake Como was awesome. Did they film it at George Clooney's villa? When Rusty takes Isabel to meet her father made me cry. I didn't meet my dad until late in life and it really touched me to see his character cry when meeting her for the first time, as if he was seeing her born for the first time. All in all this movie rocks. Keep movies like these coming. The only part of the movie I didn't quite understand was when they are all arrested and then Lynus's mom comes in and tries to get him to testify against his friends. Then they all leave. What were they let go? Was it all apart of a plan to catch the Italian guy? Either way this movie was great I wish they'd think about doing a third one cause I can't get enough of these guys.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Ocean's Twelve,"Yikes, but this is not a patch on ""Ocean's 11"" (2001). Though many of the same cast have re-assembled, the story is lacking in just about everything that made the first one good. Somehow, ""Benedict"" (Andy Garcia), whom they royally fleeced last time, has tracked them all down and wants his cash back, or else! The gang realise that are about $100m short, so devise a cunning new robbery to make up the shortfall. Thing is, after their usual meticulous planing and execution, they discover that someone has beaten them to it. Same next time, and the next - who is this genius? Well, it turns out to be a rather confident French fellow ""Toulour"" (Vincent Cassel) who basically offers them duel. The theft of a Fabergé egg from Paris. He wins, they the are toast; they win and he will pay off ""Benedict"". All of this thievery has not gone unnoticed by Europol, however, and soon they have their own agent ""Lahiri"" (Catherine Zeta-Jones) on the case too. Problems here for me are - the story, though quite quirky, is poorly executed and there are just far too many people involved in the plot and sub-plots that after a while just become a bit dull. There's quite a fun scene with Julia Roberts as herself with Bruce Willis, but otherwise this is just an overlong sequel that really just smacked of people making more money at the expense of the style, characterisation and charm of the first in the series. As you'd expect, the production standards are great - the film looks really good, but the rest of it is just a bit underwhelming.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Most fun I have ever had watching a film.,"This movie was absolutely unbelievable in every sense of the word.

In this movie there are a lot of things to follow...it isn't like ""11"" where the movie is handed to you and if you don't understand it you should be hospitalized. This movie takes more then one viewing...i saw it twice in theaters and bought the DVD yesterday and watched it again. This movie is #5 on my top 25 only beaten by Goodfellas and the 3 Die Hards.

Con is On! This time its on you,This time the con is on the fans! This sequel is specifically made to make easy money and guess what it comes from you! no thought has gone into cooking up a story -no thought has gone into attempting to give any type of direction or even editing - just a bunch of superstar smarty pants have got together to figure out how much their star power can get them in their spare time. Of course since die-hard fans of Oceans 11 (such as myself) will have to see this movie even if it is to just believe how bad it really is its a no brainer for the producers to dish any hogwash onto our plates - its a well thought of commercial strategy but very cold blooded and callous on the fans. Its extremely painful to sit through - the best performance is by Matt Damon in one particular scene which is the highest point the movie ever reaches -I hope they make an Oceans 13 and really think of a nice story this time around as a sort of apology for their bad behavior this time - or bring out an apology to all the fans they conned!,,Anonymous,Crime
Heist isn't as satisfying as the original but still a good movie,"Metimes when a movie is highly successful, a sequel is released and isn't always considering to be better than the original. That's the case with Ocean's 12. It lacks originality and doesn't have the same heist hijinks as the first movie. You aren't amazed by how the heist is pulled off in this movie compared to the first one. In the first movie, Danny Ocean perfectly planned the heist on the casino and the scenes of him planning it are so satisfying. I do enjoy the sequel though and don't have much negative thoughts about it except for the lack of originality. Watch it if you like sequels and you enjoyed the first one, but you just won't be as satisfied with the heist in this movie as the original. Cast is pretty solid too.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A letdown,"Very disappointing sequel to Ocean's 11, directed by Steven Soderbergh.In this film, Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), ripped off in 11, wants his money back plus interest, on the order of $197 million. The group has two weeks to return it.They head for Amsterdam, where they find themselves in competition with a top French criminal (Vincent Cassel). If they can steal a priceless Fabrrge egg on display in Rome before he can, he will return all Benedict's money.One big complication is the presence of Rusty's (Brad Pitt) ex-girlfriend, Isabel (Catherine Zeta-Jones) a detective determined to arrest him.Slower than 11 and much less intricate and interesting.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Soderbergh and company return to deliver a follow-up to the surprise hit Ocean's Eleven with a curiously turgid and slow adventure,"3 years after a successful heist, Danny Ocean (George Clooney), Danny's wife Tess (Julia Roberts), and the rest of Danny's crew are all living their separate lives in comfort using their shares of the score. However, Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) somehow tracks them all down and tells them they must return all $160 million they stole from him plus $38 million in interest in two weeks' time or else face the consequences. With all of Danny's crew receiving the same threat, Danny and Tess assemble Danny's partner Robert ""Rusty"" Ryan (Brad Pitt) and the rest of the Eleven to discuss options with the group collectively short of Benedict's demands and time running out, the group decides to organize a heist in Amsterdam but not only must they contend with a rival thief known as ""The Night Fox"", but also an old flame of Rusty's, Isabel Lahiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who is also a Europol agent.With Ocean's Eleven proving a massive success getting $450 million against its $85 million budget, it's no surprise that Warner Bros. Would want a sequel to such a successful venture. Reuniting director Steven Soderbergh with the principal cast of the original film, the sequel written by George Nolfi stepping in for Ted Griffin was released three years after the original film hit theaters in December of 2004. While like its predecessor it opened at number one at the box office, it ended it's worldwide run making $362 million against a $110 million budget making it slightly less successful than it's predecessor although still remaining the 10th highest grossing film of the year. Critical and audience reception was also more mixed this time around with many criticizing its slow start, confusing script, and its final twist. While the film does make itself an okay viewing experience thanks to the returning charisma of its cast, this is probably my least favorite entry in the Ocean's series.On paper having Terry Benedict track down the Ocean's crew isn't a bad setup for a sequel (especially given the first film ended with Benedict's henchman tailing Danny, Tess, and Rusty, but the way the film starts Soderbergh largely leaves the original quick and flashy style of Ocean's Eleven by the wayside, and instead opts for a slower more deliberately paced aesthetic that robs much of the impact the original film had in terms of its style so now it allows you to linger on certain elements such as the lack of depth in many of the characters. The movie also does a lot of strange things in terms of the heists in the film as we very rarely actually see the heists play out linearly and instead what Soderbergh will do is show the aftermath of a heist while cutting back to when the heist actually happened so we're missing a lot of the tension that came from carrying out the heist because we're not seeing the heist unfold naturally. The movie also goes ""meta"" this time around as we have an extended sequence where Julia Roberts' Tess pretends to b Julia Roberts which was apparently the subject re-write when Roberts became pregnant and this leads to a lengthy sequence involving Bruce Willis playing himself and it was just not a good idea. But easily the biggest downgrade is in the lack of a proper villain this time around. While Andy Garcia does reprise his role as Terry Benedict, he's not actually the primary villain and really only serves as a catalyst to get the plot moving as he only appears at the beginning and the end of the movie. The actual villain is The Night Fox played by Vincent Cassel who is responsible for giving up Ocean's Crew to Benedict and not only is Cassel not intimidating, but his shallow motivations that essentially boil down to ""my mentor liked you better than me"" are just another in a series of missteps that make you ask ""why?""Ocean's Twelve is primarily carried by the goodwill of the first film and the charm of most of its ensemble cast. The movie features some beautifully staged scenery of various European locales and tries to give a different experience from its predecessor, but aside from the exchanges among the cast Ocean's Eleven did this better.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Danny Ocean and friends are back for one more heist.this time its the heist of their lives,"I found this movie to be sleek sheik and entertaining.I found the camera techniques to be very new and neat.the cast was great and they have a chemistry with each other that is truly rare.They leave you hanging right up till the end and then you're surprised to see how it plays out.Katherine Zeta Jones joins the all star cast as a female top cop and the love interest of Rusty(Brad Pitt),who not so coincidentally chose Amsterdam to pull the job to try to raise almost 20 million to save their lives after they are tracked down by Benedict( Andy Garcias character),who wants his money back with interest.There were a few scenes that the movie could have did without.One of those being the predictable scene where they dress Julia Roberts up as,well,Julia Roberts.You just know someones going to say that she doesn't even look like her(which they do)and that they're going to run into someone that knows the ""real"" Julia,which they do.Bruce Willis was funny though and kind of saved the scene.Also the movie could've done without the confusing showing the ending and then flashing back to what happened part.It made it hard to tell what happened when.However,This movie proves to be very entertaining from start to finish and worth the rental fee.I probably wont buy it but by the same token,I'm likely to rent it again just to see parts i missed.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
My brief review of the film,"While there are enough reasons for one to have reservations about calling this a great film, I must admit that I still found it quite decent entertainment. Soderbergh keeps it well paced and entertaining on a visual level, even with some overly shaky photography and awkward freeze frames, plus there is a great plot twist involving Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis later in the film. The best aspect of this crime caper though is Catherine Zeta-Jones, who adds a lot of sparks and a fresh streak to the material. Yes, the film has its downfalls, such as the plot, which is mostly a series of incidents that only work because one does not know what will happen next, and such as Andy Garcia's cardboard acting. The film lacks much depth and does not execute the buddy-buddy aspect as well as the first film did; however it is kind of fun in its own way: mindless amusement with some great visuals, a twisted plot, and credible acting by Zeta-Jones. No, it is not as good as one would expect with Soderbergh at the helm, but neither is it all that bad.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
So you want an intricate plot?,"Film certainly can be a narrative medium, but by no means is it the ideal medium. Literature best carries a plot, because the reader can supply the imagination necessary to complete the structure. Film is appreciated best when viewed for what it is: a series of images grouped together. What Soderbergh does in Ocean's Twelve is combine impeccable film-making technique with the free-flowing form of American movies from the 1970s. From looking at the comments posted recently, most people went in expecting a standard-issue heist movie, a la Entrapment; it seems people actually miss the tiresome clichés of romance disguised as tension between the leads and ridiculous plot twists designed to keep the audience awake. Soderbergh's directing prowess is reason alone to see this movie, but close-ups of Pitt and Zeta-Jones forty feet high on the screen don't hurt either. A true treat for those who love the flickering of lights on the silver screen, and a disappointment for those trying to make film something it's not.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

"That's IT?  No, really, that's IT?!","I had very high hopes walking into this movie. After all, Ocean's 11 was a truly great Hollywood product. Its rapid-fire jokes, incredible star power and tight script made it one of the most fun caper films I have ever seen. Of course, with all the money it made, a sequel was on the way, and I, for one, was excited.Needless to say, I was absolutely blown away by this movie. Blown away by how horribly wrong things can go. This movie had everything going for it; the return of the entire original cast, the same director, news stories of crazy on- and off-set antics. How could it possibly have gone so wrong?It starts immediately with one of the most awkward and unnecessary opening sequences ever and goes downhill from there. After reasonably goofy short scenes between Pitt/Zeta-Jones and Clooney/Roberts, the film spends several minutes watching Andy Garcia waltz from scene to scene, telling each individual member of Danny Ocean's original eleven that he wants his money back. Believe me when I say that these scenes are only here to pad Andy Garcia's running time, because without these ridiculously awkward shots, his screen time would be WELL under five minutes.This leads me to another major qualm I had with this film. The pacing is so uneven that characters are dropped completely from the story, and only sometimes brought back later. Bernie Mac's character is dropped from the script early on, and never comes back except for 2 short scenes with no dialogue. Garcia appears for the first few minutes, and returns for an exceptionally brief scene at the end. Roberts shows up for about 5 minutes at the beginning, and isn't even mentioned again until there's about 20-25 minutes left. Even Clooney himself spends a large chunk of the film in prison.This would all be excusable if the film was funny. At all. 90% of the jokes fall completely flat and the ones that do work are worth a chuckle at best. The ""plot"" is undeniably worthless, and left me feeling cheated. At one point in the film, the team takes on a job worth $2.5 million of the nearly $100 million they need to raise before Garcia's two-week deadline. Several characters even acknowledge how absurd wasting the time to do this job is, but they do it anyway! Over 30 minutes of the film revolve around this job that they shouldn't even be doing, and one gets the feeling that this part of the plot was simply added to pad the running time. Furthermore, the equipment they use to pull this job off CLEARLY cost millions upon millions to fund. Just wait until you see what they do to pull this job and realize it would cost far more than $2.5 million to pull off. Obviously, because of this, they have to pull off several jobs to make the money. The beauty of the first film was the one big con and how ingeniously and intricately it was pulled off. Here, they pull so many jobs, in so many different ways, that they rush through all of them because to explain them would make the film several hours long.We all know walking into this film that there will be a big twist at the end. Thus is the nature of the caper film. The twist at the end of Ocean's Twelve made me laugh; not because it was funny, but because I couldn't believe how cheated I felt. I won't give it away, because I know most of you will be foolish enough to throw down the money to see this movie anyway.What I will say is that it makes most of the 2 hours you have sat through already completely irrelevant.I was excited to see this film, after absolutely adoring Ocean's 11. I left the theater feeling like I had been the victim of a truly great con pulled by the cast and crew of this movie in tricking me into thinking that this movie would actually be worth watching. I have never given a 1 to a movie on IMDb.com, but there's a first time for everything. Consider yourselves warned....1/10",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
Shifting Realities,"Spoilers herein.I'll go to see any Soderbergh film, but in the past I'd have to be prepared for them to be either one of his 'serious' or 'cash in' projects. Cashing in is okay, but I think his serious experiments say a lot about his intuitions and intents. They aren't the most intelligent experiments, but possibly the cream of the mainstream Hollywood director's establishment.Here we get both rolled into one. Its not as edgy or visually intelligent as 'Good Thief,' but it has some elements.First the bad: Soderbergh's notion of structure is the vignette. He'll shape a segment as if it were a skit with all else just backstory. For instance he has here a terrific piece where Pitt and Clooney as veterans and Damon as novice go to visit a Dutch heist coordinator. They converse in a highly abstract and idiosyncratic parablese which amuses us and flummoxes Damon. Damon inadvertently calls the boss's young niece a slut, and we are never sure who is putting on whom.It is a wonderful orchestration of clever writing, spontaneous acting and intimate camera-work. These last two are a particular concern of Soderbergh's, but with a well-written shape it both confused and clarified in different directions. This one segment is the soul of the whole project: it amuses, it has a lot of collaborative, seemingly ad hoc acting, and it makes no sense.This was never a heist film, instead it is in the con genre. That genre derives from the detective story where the writer is trying to fool the viewer (and some characters). In the con, some characters try to fool some other characters and the writer selectively covers and uncovers narrative so that the viewer is fooled as well.Interesting twists happen when the viewer is fooled differently than the sucker character, or when there are multiple and parallel cons. The narrative folding comes in the parallel, warring realities that the viewer must surf. But always there is a resolution of the 'real' narrative, just as in the detective story. You always find out who is the fooler and who the foolee (including ourselves).And as with the detective story, we are told just _how_ it is done. We expect this and have to be given some special reward if this doesn't happen.It doesn't happen here. There is no way to go back and put together a story that makes any sense at all. Surely this could have been done, but the plain fact is that Soderbergh doesn't care and he wants us to know he doesn't.Instead, he wants us to focus on his folding. He folds all his 'serious' films: movies about movies (more than four levels deep in 'Full Frontal') or about imagined reality. 'Limey' overlaid scattered intent with parallel jumpcuts.In this case, he has Julia acting a character who pretends to be Julia. In an homage to 'The Player' he has Bruce Willis as her companion when Julia com Julia. You can just imagine him cackling with his players over this bit.But it is all clever bits like this in the small: nothing clever at the scale of a real movie. For that, we'll have to wait until he stumbles away from his enchantment with the miracle of acting and discovers the miracle of long form writing.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,Crime
Oceans Twelve Good But With Some Flaws,"Oceans Twelve is another good caper film but with some flaws. It's not as good as the first one but the movie isn't that bad either.

Still Manages To Keep You Guessing,"One of the reasons that the first ""Ocean's"" movie was such a success was that it was full of ""Vegas Style"" that really gave it an edge. While this second effort lacks that suave style, it still manages to be exciting and keeps you guessing until the very end.For a basic plot summary, ""Ocean's 12"" begins with Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) wanting his money back. In order to come up with those kind of funds, the now-infamous thieving gang led by Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and Rusty (Brad Pitt) must take their act overseas and face off against a formidable foe in the burglary business. This time, however, Ocean's wife (played by Julia Roberts) has a bigger role in the proceedings.The reason this film manages to still hold up under the huge success of its predecessors is two- fold:1. The interplay between the characters is still excellent and quite funny. It must have been a hoot to film this one, as it sure seems as if all the main players had a great time with each other.2. The plot continues to move forward and never gets predictable or stale. It might not quite have the ""flash"" of the first one, but it still is entertaining (especially as it gears up for the climax).Overall, ""Ocean's 12"" is a solid (if less spectacular) follow-up to the glitzy original.

"Not a traditional caper movie, but that doesn't make it bad.","When I watched this movie first,I also hated it like all others. But when I saw it second time, it started to make some real sense to me. I really admired it.It's a fine rendition according to the term sequel.In the first part,they just stole the casino money from Benedict. What would you like to see in the sequel actually? Of course not another famous heist by Ocean gang,because that would've been a cliché. Instead, we would like to see how arrogant Benedict reacts at Ocean gang. And when he got the chance through Night Fox,he reacted even to the surprise of Night Fox. That suited really good for a sequel.People are complaining about the camera angle and long shots. But it didn't bother me at all. The long shot taken in the Matsui scene perfectly presented Linus's(Matt Damon)helplessness in front of Matsui's code language. He is the same man to play super CIA agent Bourne who looked very confident and desperate in Bourne's trilogy.But here in this shot,his rendition of helpless young ambitious gang member just stated his versatility boldly. The long take in Rusty's room with he and Ocean drinking and watching TV was also great to show off their frustration.Livingstone was referring to Yen as modern man who is disconnected, frightened and so on in a way that he was mocking the memorizing of literary Q/A for exam. This idea really uplifted the class of the movie much more than Schumann's special did to the building. That was really innovative,experimental and funny.The movie had great acting support from every cast member,there was great background music as well. I mean,really,how can you hate a movie with such good background music? The finishing was also very good 'twist in the tail' sort.This movie is a bit different from Hollywood mainstream. It had it's own style which included behavioral,gesture-rich acting with which we weren't quite accustomed to. But that's our problem,I guess,not the director's fault. When I first read T.S.Eliot,I dumped the book loud on the floor. Does that make Eliot rubbish?Don't try to watch it with previous determination of watching a traditional caper movie,watch it with a free mind. I think you will get the tone of the movie like I did in the second attempt.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Has its moments, but overall it was a bit too much (though I liked it better on repeat viewings)","...Steven Soderbergh, with his cast returning (and then some) from the first film, can create results that show how talented they are. Ocean's Eleven was a fun, fresh kind of heist picture, that worked off a good story on good characters, and had enough wit with comedy to balance out the more dramatic elements. Ocean's Twelve, on the other hand, juggles with the story like Tarantino on whip-its. I understood the premise pretty well from the trailers (Benedict, played by Garcia, wants all of his money back, or all eleven will be dead, so they high-tail it to Europe for a couple of prime heists). What sometimes boggled me were how the double crosses were handled, or how certain character knew others and so on and so forth. Adding to this confusion- or rather, not so much confusion as not really investing much interest in the story- Soderbergh fuses the film with his camera-work that is stylish, but overly so. It's one thing to be expressive with the camera, as Soderbergh can be (Traffic works very well off of the hand-held usage and filters). It's another thing to draw attention to the technical side while the story jump-ropes.On top of this, the actors, while sometimes on the money (in particular Vincent Cassell in what could be his American breakthrough role as the ""night-fox""), can also be a little too thin to deal with. I understand it's a silly caper comedy, but I should be able to invest my emotions with these people, and about two-thirds into the movie I didn't care much about them. Take Catherine Zeta-Jones' character, playing a cop who once had a fling with Rusty (Pitt). Are we supposed to not like her, or like her, or kinda go back and forth. She's gorgeous to look at, but she's not given the kind of one-liners the others get. By the time the third act rolls around, the scenes seem like they've been filmed improv style (not a total downer), but without much coherence to where the story to go.Basically, I knew I didn't totally despise Ocean's Twelve, however the sense of over-load made me say to myself a few times ""ok, so what's the point?"" I respect that the actors had fun making the film, as it is a lot better than being miserable through the shoot. But when it starts to distract from the focus of the scenes there's trouble (I could see smirks on them in some scenes where they could of had more of a better grip on what was really going on). Now, this is not to say I don't enjoy it when a director implements a crazy kind of style- Kill Bill vol. 1 is a triumph for that very reason- as long as it doesn't try and compensate for something wrong with the material. To put it another way, Ocean's Twelve is like an art-film that's struggling to break away from the hackneyed, conventional Hollywood 'hip' kind of standard, and the result is an equal amount of boredom, fascination, and slight indifference. There's also a sweet, if occasionally tiresome, jazz score that rings of 70's TV. C+ (6/10)",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Soderbergh Has the Best Eye in Hollywood,"I loved this movie, I thought it was far superior to the first in most ways. Where the first was just a fun heist movie with some fun characters and situations, this movie is one of the most technically perfect, well directed, beautifully shot movies I have seen in many years. I came out of the theater with a friend who is a cinematographer and we were both gob-smacked by what we had just seen. Even the obligatory airplane landing establishing/transition shot to connect the action in the U.S. to Europe isn't spared from Soderberg's innovative hands. The camera is directly under the path of the plane and as it passes overhead, we tilt over, and over and over and follow the plane until the camera POV is upside down as the plane comes in for it's landing. The concept isn't all that exciting, but the vibrance and energy little moments like that adds a great deal to the experience. The entire film seems to have been shot hand-held - not steady-cam, which can look too smooth for my tastes, but with an old-fashioned, over the shoulder camera rig. The camera doesn't do that ""modern"" (but actually outdated) shaky style that tries (and usually fails) to mimic a documentary feel. The camera is held as steady and is possible by the operators, but the natural, almost imperceptible slight movements the camera makes made the proceedings seem more immediate, a tad more frenetic and overall, more dynamic to watch. The photography is always beautiful and the choice of music throughout is dead-on. Again, all the performances are top notch, my only real complaint is that several of the characters seemed to have very little to do this time around. (Bernie Mac, most notably, who spends about 1/2 the movie in a prison cell - I want more Bernie!) But those are minor quibbles for what is over all a vastly superior movie to the first - this one is actually a work of art.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Works very well with a second viewing.,"I was a big fan of oceans eleven and when i heard they were making a sequel i was excited. Then i saw the sequel and was fairly disappointed. I didn't like the direction of the movie and thought that the jokes fell flat. I also had a hard time following and understanding what was going one. I decided that when it came out on video i would watch it again in hope of liking it more. So I watched it the second time and found that I really enjoyed it. I understood the jokes and could really follow the plot very closely. I found that the plot was very clever and that the acting was done very well.

(Almost) Excellent,"I saw this movie a short while ago. It is surely not the same as the first one, and it does't have the ""flair"" and ""coolness"" as the first Oceans Eleven. But that's what makes this movie so great. They don't have time to plan their ""moves"" and think things through. They are on the run so they have to think fast. In my opinion the audience is taken on a spectacular joy-ride with many twists and turns. The Actors and Actresses play their roles as you want them to. Everyone is believable and funny in their own way. Vincent Cassel is my favorite actor in this movie, don't get me wrong they were all very good but he stood out a little bit. The people who have seen the Movie already know which scene I'm talking about. The only reason I didn't give it ten stars is because it does kinda miss a surprising twist in the end, but this ending is well done to.I recommend this movie to everyone because it's a great sequel to the first one and and I would love to see an Oceans Thirteen.

"Disappointing, Yet Still Entertaining","Ocean's Twelve is the weakest film in the Oceans trilogy. However, despite the move to Europe, this film has most of the ingredients the first one had, making it still an entertaining viewing. It just didn't feel right when watching it, but does become a key part of the continuous storyline that plays throughout the three films; making it a must watch for fans of the first.I have to mention the Julia Roberts/Julia Roberts scene was just bad.

The film is developed in European scenarios : Ámsterdam , Roma , lagoon Como (where Clooney has got a mansion), but in spite of these marvelous places , there are barely outdoors . The picture is very boring and tiring , is slow-moving , there aren't action-packed , neither emotion , nor humor or suspense and a little intrigue .

Entertaining but nothing more,"Yes it's true, the first one doesn't even compare to this flick and there aren't going to be any Oscars for this one. But its still entertaining. It doesn't have any of the exiting build up that oceans 11 has and personally I just would have shot Andy Garcia and be done with it, bat that doesn't really make a story doesn't it, we'd be walking out in 10 minutes ;). Just don't have to high expectations of it and you'll enjoy it. I did... sequels usually suck and this wasn't so bad... like I said, enjoyable...

Reasonably entertaining but the messy plot and lack of cohesion really suck the fizz out of it  even if the stars appear to be really enjoying it,"Several years on from their job in Las Vegas and Danny Ocean's crew have been sold out to Terry Benedict, who has visited each of them to give them two weeks to pay back the money they stole, with interest. Too hot to work in America, the crew head to Europe to pull off a series of jobs to earn the money but find themselves outsmarted by another ""master"" thief who is willing to pay off their debt if Ocean will indulge him in a challenge to see who is the best thief. So, with Benedict and Interpol Detective Isabel Lahiri breathing down their necks, the crew come together to pull off the job.With the remake of Ocean's Eleven, things seemed to move so quickly with such flair and style that substance didn't matter that much and it managed to pull off the trick and come across as fluffy fun. The sequel clearly tries to pull off the same trick but it cannot manage it and, although it has some fun moments, it ends up being pretty messy, lacking slick pace and failing to really please the audience in the way that its predecessor did. The plot feels like it has been forced and it cannot cope with the messy detail nor move fast enough to distract us from it; whole sections make little sense and, when the final twist comes you will struggle not to feel betrayed by how you have spent the hour before. Instead of a nice narrative flow the film is more like a series of set pieces  few of these really work that well and some of them fall quite flat. Even when they worked I couldn't shake the feeling that the cast were enjoying it more than us; certainly this appeared to be the case with the whole ""look-a-likey"" collection of in-jokes and several of the other scenes.The cast are enjoying themselves but that doesn't mean that the film uses them well at all. Clooney and Pitt are good because they have plenty of screen time and ooze cool for the majority of the film. Damon cuts his way into the screen time with a nice line of joking about ""coming up"" but Roberts and Jones are really pushed to the edges of the film even if they do have some things to contribute. Affleck, Caan, Garcia, Qin, Mac, Cheadle, Reiner, Gould and Coltrane are all pretty wasted and are often just pushed out of the story for the sake of convenience (Mac and Qin are two very good examples). Willis is actually quite amusing, Cassel is not that bad and Izzard is pretty good in a minor role.Overall though the film is never better than average; reasonably entertaining at best. The plot is all over the place and cannot even distract the audience enough so that the holes are hidden until the end; as it is the second half of the film is a shambles and I couldn't help but be annoyed by it  hell, it doesn't even have the gloss, shine and flair of the first film. The cast appear to have enjoyed themselves but many of them have next to nothing to do and it all just feels a bit too cluttered for most of the time. The first vehicle was fun and slick; this one tries to keep up but stalls way too many times.",,Anonymous,Crime
things that make you go HUH?,"I agree 100 % with the previous comment on Ocean's 12. I was very blown away by 11 and was anxiously waiting this movie. When I heard that a sequel was in the works I replied, ""What are they gonna call it, OCEAN'S 12"" and they did. The Addition of Catherine Zeta-Jones did not mean beans to me. To me it seemed the movie set around her. BLAH..

But I love BRAD and can watch him all day/night. I stuck around for you BRAD.

Funny but Uneven,"17 December 2004. This robbery caper is dazzlingly funny and entertaining. But the characters in this movie get uneven movie time and one of the great switches at the end of the movie is flat. Yet, it appears that the star-studded cast is having a good time, the Julia Robert's acting role at the end is delightful, the surprise cameo is fun. Overall the script, plot is decent, the required tension and conflict present. This is fun but perhaps unmemorable movie that is a nice holiday treat that is easy to swallow but required some help along with way. Matt Damon is particularly fascinating because of his other movie, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" that offers an amazing contrast in characters, illustrating his acting depth. Oceans 12 is like a cast of super stars having an opportunity to get together, allowing us a glimpse of an ensemble performance with some of the actors being given a bit more screen time, and an invitation for us to join in the romp and display of informal holiday spirits and jollies.

Witty Sequel Stands Alone as Intelligent Comedy; not a Traditional Heist,"Ocean's Twelve faces the same difficulties as any sequel. By this I don't mean those movies that are essential components to trilogies that continue the story; I mean those movies that basically take an established cast and throw them in a completely new storyline. The problem is trying to meet the expectations of an audience that loved the first and wants a new movie to love for all the same reasons. So many people were disappointed to learn that Ocean's Twelve was not yet another heist movie.This film had to be a sequel. The plot takes advantage of the relationships the characters developed in the first film, and throws in many MANY subtle jokes the average viewer may miss if they don't listen closely. Some of the phrases like ""thief a la mode"" used in the film may require a bit of culture to appreciate.Be warned that while Ocean's team do work together in the same fashion as the first film, the thievery itself doesn't take the spotlight in the film. Ocean's Eleven was the traditional heist film in its plot development with its climax at the point of executing the plan. Ocean's Twelve breaks away from this formula in favor of developing opportunities for some great character interaction.The film disappoints with many characters taking a back seat in their roles to such an extent that the film could have been named after Pitt's character, with the Benedict aftermath merely serving as a catalyst for the characters finding their way back together. However, it would have been unreasonable for all eleven original characters to share an equal share of the spotlight and still turn out as well.In the end, Ocean's Twelve is not a mere heist film but an Intelligent Comedy that may need to be watched more than once to appreciate some of the subtleties in the dialog. Just the amount of activity on this film's message board regarding some of the subtleties in the plot is a testament to the thought that went into making this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
European Vacations for Free,"The best swindle that goes on in this movie is the one behind the scenes. Not only do the cast and crew con the studio out of paying them salaries for a movie that makes PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE look like a masterpiece but they get free trips to Europe as well. To top that they release the movie and con people into buying tickets. Sweet.Everything that can go wrong here does. Bad writing. Inept direction. The most annoying musical score since THE HOURS. Actors who seem bored and don't even attempt characterizations.Somehow the costume director and cinematographer didn't get the message that they weren't supposed to work too hard. The film is very well costumed and has good camera work.This is a sequel to OCEAN'S ELEVEN and presumes that the viewer saw that movie last night. I could only remember about half of the characters and many of them for the wrong reasons. George Clooney for being the ringleader. Don Cheadle for that dreadful attempt at a Cockney accent. The Asian guy for being Asian. Brad Pitt for being Brad Pitt. Elliot Gould for a bad haircut. Carl Reiner for being bald. The other five were just there.The first movie very carefully built up the characterizations and gave motivation for the big robbery. Here the characters are rounded up like cattle and thrown together, and these fine actors simply deserve better.The story literally skips all over the place. Various locations in the United States. Several cities in Europe. Of course that gave the actors more stops on their vacations, so it's understandable. It's just confusing for the viewer.The first movie's downfall was going on two minutes too long. If they had ended with the scenes in front of the fountains it would have been a classic in the genre. By tacking on the scene with George Clooney and Julia Roberts getting together at the end it ended on a flat note.This one goes to the bad early on in the game. And Julia Roberts is subjected to a plot twist (don't worry, no spoilers if you want to see it) that is probably the stupidest one ever seen on film. It was so stupid that I do hope the director released Julia's mother from the dungeon when she finished filming it.One of the worst moments in this involves a, well, dance number that's part of one of the heists. It's done in a room being constantly being swept by lasers in a random pattern. Let me repeat that: RANDOM pattern. What we see is interesting but your brain is telling you, sorry, this won't work. Not if the lasers are in a truly random pattern.Hopefully this one was bad enough that we'll be spared an OCEAN'S THIRTEEN, unless they want to have Jason Voorhes slaughter the cast, the writer, the director, and especially the composer on screen.

style in motion,"The key to understanding Ocean's Twelve and enjoying it is to realize that this film does not try to be a film about a bunch of gangsters pulling off a heist. It is a film about style. When it is explained in the end how they pulled off their heist, we understand that almost everything they did in the last third of the movie had no reason at all. They just did it for the style points and to make their adversary's defeat even more bitter. In my book, that's style. The movie flows freely, never really climaxing, watching beautiful people with beautiful voices, dressed in the height of fashion. It is amusing, not really funny except occasionally, not really suspenseful, but it is permeated by the feeling that everyone involved had a lot of fun - and it practically oozes out of the screen infecting the audience. It seems as if Soderbergh thought that he had done ""his heist-movie"" in Ocean's Eleven, so now he made the ""meta heist-movie"". It is a thoroughly enjoyable experience and i left the theater with a feeling of joy in my heart and the wisdom of true style in my bones. Style Uber Alles! Mahalo!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Most of the movie is there just to give each star equal amount of screen time, mostly to show the love story sub-plots. The movie drags on and on with out anything happening. Only the last third has anything to do with the heist (which how they do it is ridicules). The part where Julia Roberts character plays Julia Roberts is the worst scan in a movie ever.

That's not to say that the remake of 'Ocean's Eleven's new chapter to a shaky franchise is the case but it is certainly a tricky maneuver much like a sucker has to deal with in a fixed game of three card monty.The Ocean Eleven is back - just like the film's tag-line 'Twelve Is the New Eleven' in that this incarnation the odds are even more against the rag-tag cool cadre of thieves when they are reluctantly re-assembled after their last mark, silky sinister Vegas casino hot-shot Terry Benedict (sadly underused Garcia) is chomping at the bit for his nemesis Danny Ocean (Clooney practically attempting to pass somnambulism as waycool fortitude in a phone-in charm curdled turn) to repay him the $160 M bust (plus interest) his posse pilfered three years ago. With a window of two weeks the gang are back together for one final job in Europe.Returning are retro cool Rusty Ryan (Pitt), eager to be his own criminal Linus Caldwell (Damon), bloke safecracker Basher Tarr (Cheadle), street smart Frank Catton (Mac), knuckle-head Malloy brothers Turk and Virgil (Caan and Affleck, respectively), seasoned pros Reuben Tishkoff and Saul Bloom (Gould and Reiner, respectively ), techie geek Livingston Dell (Jamieson) and Chinese acrobat 'greaseman' Yen (Qin)  who more or less have gone to less-distinguished yet 'legit' lives since their big score.Also on hand is long-suffering Tess (Roberts), now Danny's re-married wife who pines for domestic niceties and police detective Isabel Lahiri (Zeta-Jones)  ex-gal pal of Rusty  who is hot on the trail of her boyfriend.This over-thought and undercooked crime spree is convoluted and a tad too sure of itself even as it asks the ridiculous notion of the group to simply screw things up and let the domino effect fall where it may is what is truly at fault in George Nolfi's screenplay and the addition of master thief Eurotrash Francois Toulor Cassel) to gum up the works slams the brakes on the trip to Coolsville the film so arduously attempts to rekindle the far superior remake it subsists off like some cinematic vulture on carrion.What is to like are the sprinkles of humorous dialogue between the chemistry, baby, chemistry of this unlikely gathering of men on the take for the easy life with no strings attached and the bonhomie, although stilted since many of the ensemble is stretched out like so many potholes, retains a few moments of relaxed anxiety.What I truly tired of was the addition of Mr. Willis' unwelcome 'cameo' that is the definition of star-tripping smugness that clearly grinds things to a halt by the film's troubled third act ; 'nuff said.Soderbergh's camera is all knowing angles and scattershot editing is his trademark and at least attempts to keep the plottings such as they are lively.

"As far as sequels go, it's okay","It's been ages since I saw the first Ocean's Eleven movie, but I remember it being a good deal better than this sequel (though not like a stone cold classic or anything; just good entertainment). It felt a little more slick and tighter overall, whereas Ocean's Twelve does meander, feel a little messy at times, and also takes a while to get going. The opening half-hour that sets up the new mission(s) while checking in on everyone feels a bit clunky and awkward.But after the opening third, it becomes more enjoyable. Plenty of charismatic performances and light entertainment; despite having so many characters and a lot of moving parts, it feels more enjoyable to watch it casually. There's also a really silly thing that they do with Julia Roberts' character in the second half that's also kind of entertaining. It's dumb, but funny, and probably will prove to be the part of this I remember most.I like a good heist movie, but this is not really a good heist movie. It's a decent heist-ish movie, but not as laser focused on one heist the way the first one was, which probably made it feel sloppier. Still, it was okay entertainment, and the third one has Al Pacino in it; I'll watch anything with him in it, so at least there's that to look forward to (I've also heard it's an improvement on this).",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not a good Ocean's movie...,"The plot/story is pretty unrealistic and far fetched: As soon as the 'bad guy' showed up at the first person's house, then that person would have immediately contacted all the other people to warn them of the impending doom... and in addition to that, why on earth would they all have stayed in the US? OBVIOUSLY if you have that kind of money, then you'd have R-U-N-N-O-F-T to another country... nobody in their right mind with that kind of money would have been THAT easy to find and THAT stupid... so those are the 2 biggest plot-holes with the movie. It honestly makes the entire story implausible, but OK, let's just go ahead and say that we're dealing with the 11 stupidest and most naive people on the face of the planet...Another problem with this movie is that unlike in the previous movie where the Ocean's Crew were incredibly intelligent and always one step ahead of everybody the whole time: In this movie they're basically just a group of shoddy, 2nd-rate crooks who can't even steal candy from a baby... they fumble and trip over themselves like a bunch of children straight out of kindergarten... the movie goes completely against the tone and atmosphere that was created in the first movie.Overall, it's not a very good 'Ocean's' movie... does that make it a bad movie?

I have lost count of the times I've watched Ocean's Twelve on DVD - it is pure, engaging entertainment, a 2000's version of a 60's movie. Audrey and Carey are lurking just around the corner. There is something plain likable about a bunch of desperate thieves who have a conscience, and actors who buy into the dynamic. The dialog is snappy, the situations are believable, if not entirely plausible, but not absurd either. I liked Ocean's Eleven, this one with the European connection is classier, and funnier. The music is upbeat, and attractive, like almost everything else about the production.

"Horrible, self-serving, disjointed movie","Ocean's 12 starts off on annoying and gets worse from there on. Like a celebrity awards presentation, each major actor/actress is introduced in short 60-second scenarios that seem to stop just short having a blinking ""applaud now"" sign. The first 60 minutes of the film are incredibly disjointed, poorly edited, and at times, utterly unrelated to the story and confusing. Speaking of the story,...there is one, kinda,...but its barely visible for all the ""look at me"" shots and cameos. Only Matt Damon seemed to actually ""act"" during this film...the rest of the cast appeared to only be there to participate in a rat-pack-wanna-be session. As for the heist, the action, the drama....it was put into the last 8-10 minutes of the movie and was pathetic and anticlimactic. Horrible! Horrible! Horrible!",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
Seems like they had even more fun making this one..,"Well, I saw the movie about four hours ago in a special sneak preview in Tempe, AZ. The movie was.. well.. different. The first movie contained something that's been locked in a room in the Department of Mysteries in the Ministry of Magic. It's a force that Voldemart hates and which Harry Potter possesses in abundance. It is the force of ""COOL"". Ocean's Eleven dripped with this force, and was the best heist movie I ever saw. Don't expect that from this movie.You remember how in the 'Eleven' there was also the humor factor involved with the 'oomph'. Well, that's the other force 'Twelve' contains. This movie contains stories of different humans, involved in a situation. Yes, Benedict is on their case. He wants his money back. They have 2 weeks to get it back. You'll have drama. Excitement. Lots more 'Cool'. More thieves. More Cops. More relationships ( Clooney-Roberts, Pitt-Zeta Jones parallel), 'human' situations (which I like), of course some heisting and lots more fun.I give it 9/10. I know my review doesn't conclude anything except the digits in the beginning of this paragraph, but watch the movie, it'll speak for itself. Overall, it's a good sequel.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

an amazing feat in futile film-making,"There is nothing redeeming here- do not waste time and money. There was plenty of both of these wasted on making this cinematic atrocity. It is chunky and cutesy, the plot is just a thin veil of stylish pretense, the acting is non-present- that is George Clooney really plays George Clooney, Brad Pitt plays Brad Pitt and so on. It is not even interesting to watch for any given segment. Even a fun, cool city like Amsterdam looks boring. It is actually quite amazing that such a big group of big actors, aided by the likes of Vincent Cassel and Eddie Izzard can deliver a film so phenomenally bland. I have never had high expectations of Steven Soderbergh- that cute little film he made in the 80's drove him way, way too long past his directing capabilities. I really saw no reason why he should have any decency to make films after he messed up ""Solaris"", but I guess he was meant to make this turd.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
Ocean's Twelve Should Have Been Shelved?,"Soderbergh springs a surprise. It's not a pleasant one. 'Ocean's 12' has an awful screenplay and the director seems clueless at times. Seriously, to even think that Soderbergh was behind this is still a little difficult to digest. The film has some cool gizmos and gadgets, none of which manage to sustain our attention for long. There are some very nice shots of Europe and the soundtrack is quite awesome. It actually drags a lot in the beginning until Catherine Zeta-Jones appears in the fake Interpol (which was actually shot in the City Hall of the Hague). Perhaps it's the glamour portion of Ms. Zeta-Jones that grabs the attention and she does reasonably well until her character is messed up towards the end. Sadly, she and Pitt do not have chemistry. Actually, all the actors from 'Ocean's 11' are terribly wasted in this one. Clooney looks uninterested and lost. Pitt looks as though he could care less. Damon tries to bring some comic relief but fails (what could he have done anyway, if his co-stars were so uninterested?). Cheadle is given nothing but a few lines and the rest are all relegated to the background for the most part. However, I thought Vincent Cassel performed the best. His amazing Capoeira demonstration is in my opinion the best thing to come out of the film. As I myself have practiced capoeira for a while, I was impressed by Cassel's skill. Julia Roberts is whining in the beginning but she the Julia Roberts playing Tess playing Julia Roberts sequence is ridiculously funny. It made me chuckle and made the film worse. Thus, in spite of all the hi-tech, 'Ocean's 12' is quite a wasted effort. the film lacks a heart.",,Anonymous,Crime
One redeeming quality...,"There is only one redeeming quality in this film, that would be the superb acting quality of Vincent Cassel. His turn as the ""Night Fox"" is superb, he outshines the ""stars"" in the film. Bravo, Vincent, bravo! Other than Cassel, the rest is flat. Yes, Catherine is beautiful, to be expected. As is Pitt, which is also to be expected. Clooney is flat, Roberts is outshone by Catherine (which isn't hard to do BTW). Bernie Mac is underused, as is Cheadle. Andy Garcia was good, anything less would be uncivilized. But again, Cassel is the gem in the picture, hopefully if there is a Ocean's 13 they will beg him to come back and use his talent more and not call him ""Mr. Monica Bellucci"" in interviews. The locations are beautiful, how could they not be seeing as it was shot completely on location?",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
2nd installment of the Ocean's trilogy.,Ocean's 12 continue the original's style and is a good breezy movie though perhaps a bit lesser in quality than the original. All the cast are back and this time the gang has been located by Garcia and they must return everything they had stolen and then some. The gang seeks to steal something even larger than the Casino gold from the previous film and choose a diamond in Europe. This film also has some cameos and other quips which you may or may not appreciate. Soderbergh is in nice form again and Ocean's 12 is a nice continuation of the Ocean's gang.,6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Too far from the original (!?!) remake.,"'If you steal fifty million dollars, they will find you.' (Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber, Die Hard) This adage certainly rings true in this sequel. Terry Benedict has been informed that Danny Ocean and his compadres were the ones who ripped him off and now he wants his money back. Therefore, the Ocean gang needs a lot of money and fast, but cannot work in the states as Benedict has made it impossible for them. So it's off to Europe to perform acts of death defying thievery, whilst trying to avoid Catherine Zeta Jones' super cop, an old flame from Rusty's (Pitt's) past.On their first heist in Amsterdam they find out that who ratted on them was the 'Night Fox', a super slick thief with a legend complex. He issues them with a challenge that could write off their debt in full or land them in some kind of Uma Thurman Kill Bill II buried alive sequence. Interesting? Well, yes. Slow? Sort of. Entertaining? Mostly. Unnecessary scenes of character development? Plenty.Soderbergh, who did not direct the first film, has given his actors licence to 'evolve' their parts, which for this franchise is probably not the best idea. What worked so well in the last film was the lack of character development, complemented by the slickness of the mission impossible style heist. Ocean's Eleven looked like the cover of Vogue magazine or an advert for Gucci and the characters' lack of depth helped polish the film to a high and glossy shine. Ocean's Twelve wants to move past this through idiosyncrasies and little character ticks and deepen the glossy and superficial cover picture. This may have worked because the chemistry within the Ocean gang is comfortable and entertaining. Unfortunately, it does not as Catherine Zeta Jones' super cop upsets this delicate balance. She fits into this film like a big square peg in a tight Ocean's 11 sided hole and her chemistry with Pitt is non-existent.The star of this film for me is Vincent Cassel. His Night Fox is arrogant, cavalier and makes being rich look like tremendous fun. He is the yang to the Americans' ying; he is immoral where they are moral (?!); his Night Fox is the darker side to professional thievery whereas the Americans are the acceptable face of stealing over a hundred million in someone else's cash simply because they make it look so cool. Cassel also plays the part with a natural swagger and depth that contrasts heavily with the newly found 'depth' of the American actors. Normally contrast is a good thing as it makes things complicated and layered, but from this franchise we want superficial, gloss and polish. So, for me, this is where the film does not work.All of this together and we end with simply this: the age old adage 'integrity comes from being true to yourself' is something that this franchise should have thought more carefully about.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

weird chemistry,"There are certain times at the cinema when it slowly becomes clear that you're the only person who is loving the film. A weird chemistry occurs in which your enjoyment of the evening is diametrically opposed to everyone elses. And so it was tonight during Ocean's Twelve. It really isn't the film anyone was expecting, but that actually means is so much better. If you're a fan of the first film because of all the heist hijinks you'll probably hate this. If you're a fan of Steven Soderbergh and seen all of his films, you'll just love it.I don't want to talk about the plot here because frankly you wouldn't believe me. Just when you think the film is going to settle down into some kind of recognisable rhythm, something entirely unexpected is thrown in turning everything on it's head. You know the moment at the end of the first film when everything you thought you saw turned out to be something different? Pretty much every scene here is like that. Which is probably were I and nearly all the mean spirited reviews I've read part company. The general feeling seems to be that the plot was thrown together and the story lacks structure. Well yes that's the point. Soderbergh's messing about with what you're allowed to do in a so-called typical Hollywood sequel. It's experimental rather than erratic.I'll admit to a degree that is a greatest hits of Soderbergh's greatest hits, with a variety of film stock and messy camera angles on display. Flashbacks are in full evidence as are the freeze frames and captions in multiple fonts. But so what? Would it have been better if some hack had been hired to trot out a clone of the first film, clinically perfect without any passion? He should be applauded for not making the same movie again, opting instead for something which resembles his own Full Frontal, with obscure film in-jokes intact.

The Best Ocean's movie,"This movie is quite fun. A surprise to be sure but a welcome one. It is not quite a heist movie; it is rather a comedy on the previous heist movie.So to put things into perspective, when the Oceans Trilogy was done the consensus was that 11 was an instant cult-classic, 12 was a weird disappointment and 13 a highly welcomed return to the roots.
As in many cases (Alien 4 or Ang Lee's Hulk, Starship Troopers) sometimes everybody is wrong and only later we rediscover how beautiful, poignant or visionary certain art can be.
I am re-watching the series more than a decade later and I am surprised how wrong the zeitgeist was. 11 is very dated, 13 is pure garbage and 12 is actually not bad.Oceans Twelve is actually the diamond in the rough. The forgotten gem. The overlooked ugly duckling of the trilogy(universe).
I low-key love this movie. It is not perfect, it is not the best movie ever. But especially after watching Ocean Eleven, this movie was so refreshing, funny, original and interesting.
It is not surprising on paper : Oceans Twelve enjoys doing the opposite of 11. I think it adds to the quality of the film, Twelve is fairly meta and loves no to take things too seriously. That is already the case in 11, and it bothered me. Because there was no reason these character acted so nonchalantly. The charm was not earned. The characters were not caricatures, they were played straight. They were the best and the coolest not by doing anything but just by being there. They had all the skills and they were the best at them.
In this movie the main characters Clooney and Pitt are acknowledged to not have any skill whatsoever. In this movie, they are plain assholes. And it is great. Of course it is intended to be ironic, but I think it works towards the film. In that regard the movie is rightfully the sequel of 11, where Clooney and Pitt do something that they think is clever but that is not in reality. In addition, the irony that the film wants to convey is not aimed towards Danny Ocean and Rusty, the characters or the plot; but it is towards Clooney and Pitt themselves. How funny the films thinks it is when Pitt and Clooney watch Oprah on the couch, while trying to fall asleep. The film involuntarily builds its characters through these inside jokes. And of course it is bad. But it is so bad it's good. Same with the scene Matt Damon asking for a bigger role, same with the Julia Roberts as Julia Roberts cameo.
This film works because it is an inversion of the first movie. You see Clooney and Roberts actually interact here, they have affection, they have a secret code, we get why they are together. Pitt plays Rusty as a suave seducer, which is hiding how clueless he is, we get an understanding of his characters because we see his failings. Everybody plays a caricature of themselves, and it works because the movie is in on it. The movie does not understand why it is funny, but we do. My favorite scene is when Matt Damon takes a moment to ask if we should make fun of a handicapped person, and everybody shoots him down. I loved it because the movie then proceeds to go with it anyway.
My enjoyment of this movie comes in larger part from the contrast with the first one. However the movie also tries in many ways to subvert the heist movie tropes. Again that is why this one is more watchable 20 years later. The heist in this movie is basically an anti-heist. And I don't really mind. Ocean 11 also at its core did not care for the heist, which made me ask to myself why the audience should. Here the movie does not care and we should not care. Here the movie is pure charm; you get to spend 2h in travelling through Europe with the gang. That is it. This is just a big excuse to spend some time with these guys. And it is actually enjoyable, because the locations are cool and exotic and not fake with the veneer of luxury, the music is cool and not recycled, and characters seem genuine and not artificial.
The first movie spent actually a lot of effort to try to not take things too seriously. Twelve actually does take things less seriously.
And this were you find the reason why people hated it. It builds on the first movie, but it goes resolutely against the grain. On purpose. So it is at the same time the best sequel, because it takes the first movie at face value and asks what do these characters do after they've executed the biggest heist ever. And for someone looking to have the same movie as the last time, it is the worst sequel.
You could throw the whole Oceans trilogy in the garbage if wasn't for this movie, that is why it is hands down the best Ocean's movie.Posted :

Ocean's Twelve,"Ocean's Eleven (2002) is an awesome film  fact. It's got class, plot, good characters (more impressive considering the number of people it involves), humour, and tons of style. And whilst the sequel brings back everyone from the original it is, to be blunt, not as good. It is good, just not as good.But this has nothing to do with the cast, which are still the high-point of the film, whether it be the general bickering amongst the group or George Clooney's and Brad Pitt's near telepathic conversations, and everything they had to make the first film so entertaining has been preserved here  it is evident that the cast and crew had a huge amount of fun making the film. All the newcomers are excellent as well, particularly Catherine Zeta-Jones as a Europol agent and former lover of Rusty's (Pitt). So there can be no complaints about the cast.Where the complaints lie (and it must be said that whilst compared to the first film this is not as great, it is still better than most of the films I've seen recently) are in the plot, and the general look of the film. The plot is a little rushed, and seems almost just an excuse to get the gang back for another round. After a rather effective scene with Terry Benedict threatening each member of the group individually, the film jumps to Europe (Amsterdam, Rome, and Paris to be specific), and this constant moving around can feel a little disorientating compared to the original.Also, because there is not much of a time frame for the team, there is no time to plan  and therefore show  the elaborate heist. This sense of urgency is punctuated by the use of a shaky camera, but this just alienates the audience from the sense of style from Ocean's Eleven. It also gives the feeling that the whole team just aren't as smooth as they were last time. The sense of timing is a little confusing as well, as it keeps jumping from the past to the present and back again. Finally, the real problem is (and I don't think I'm really giving anything away) that there is no big heist here, at least not in comparison to the lengthy and elaborate heist from Ocean's Eleven. And unlike last time, instead of one big twist  and we all know there's going to be one  it is broken up into several smaller twists which deadens the impact somewhat.However, as I said above, Ocean's Twelve is a good film. The above complaints are justified because we know what this cast and crew are capable of. So in that respect it is a bit disappointing; but there is plenty to enjoy and it should keep you well entertained. The humour is still very much there, probably even amplified this time around, with several laugh-out-loud moments; including one surreal, though fairly amusing scene, where Tess (Julia Roberts) has to get involved and impersonate Julia Roberts! It comes across as a little too much like a pantomime but is still fun nonetheless, especially when she runs into old ""friend"" Bruce Willis.The joy about Ocean's Eleven, and therefore Ocean's Twelve, is that it never takes itself too seriously, allowing the audience to sit back and enjoy the fun which, although not on a par with the original, is still damn fine entertainment.Rated: 7/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.netSecond opinion/ Re-viewing:I think Ocean's Twelve caught me on a good day, because I can now see how much the quality dips in the second dose of Danny Ocean and pals. The Julia-Roberts-being-herself scene - described in the main review as ""fun"" - is actually very painful and embarrassing to watch. The whole adventure seems like an excuse for the cast to come back and just have a good time amongst themselves; the problem is that they seem to have left the audience out of their group, ensuring that all the obvious excitement on screen is not translated in a way the audience can truly latch onto. Let hope that Steven Soderbergh can recreate the magic from Ocean's Eleven in time to make a difference on the recently announced Ocean's Thirteen.Re-rated: 6/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Pleasantly surprised at the inventiveness of Ocean's Twelve,"As a great fan of the original Rat Pack fan, I didn't bother watching the remake of Ocean's Eleven until it appeared on a dreary night on pay TV. What an incredibly boring, dull, cold, sterile, lifeless, worthless film. It should never have been made and I kicked myself for wasting my time. The blandness of all the lead actors compared starkly in mind to the great personalities of the 1960 minor classic.It was with reluctance I traipsed in the rain (with my friend Alita) to see Ocean's Twelve on the big screen at the fabulous Delta Cinema in the main street of Ayr, North Queensland. (One of the world's great cinemas, well worth a visit).However, I was pleasantly surprised that Soderbergh took a completely different approach to his earlier clanger. Ocean's Twelve had humour, wit and warmth that was completely lacking in his first effort.The same pretty ordinary cast (give me the Rat Pack any day) made an effort to put some spark into their performances. The Julia Roberts sequence was hysterically funny - almost slapstick - without taking away from the texture of the film. I admit The low-key acting of Damon, Willis et al worked well in this particular sequence.Best of all Soderberg was much more inventive in his cinematic storytelling. I have only seen a couple of his pictures, so I am no expert on his work. But it occurred to me that with Ocean's Twelve, he may well have been influenced by the inventiveness of Richard Lester. Possibly no surprise since Soderbergh's revealing and entertaining interview with Lester is a classic of film literature. The playful use of titles and imaginative camera angles and shots gave the sequel the pizazz good caper film needs.And as for those twists - well, it added to the fun.I was so pleased that the director took a different tack. For days afterward the one-liners, the ""Amsterdam"" title and the zoom shots of the prisoners being released were still playing over in my head.Soderbergh's Ocean's Eleven was like watching paint dry, only not as entertaining.Ocean's Twelve is film-making.

An intrigue is built by revealing the facts but not the connections. Plus, there's a number of logical flaws in the scenario.The ugly.

Simply awful,"Where to start?The premise is absolutely unbelievable. The casino owner from the first movie frightens the 11 so much they devise a new con to pay him back?The goofy plot twists involving the new con make no sense or pretty much affect the action. Particularly since the con was over before it started.A holographic Faberge Egg? C'mon. And then they stiffed the guy who made it.Julia Roberts' character (Tess) pretending to be Julia Roberts was maybe the silliest thing I have ever seen.The camera work was purely high school AV club level. The zooming in on each of the 11 as they were leaving the police station almost gave me seizures.But the music. Half the movie is musical interludes paired with senseless video montages. Most of the music is repetitive mind-numbing rhythms that are preprogrammed into cheap synthesizers. These musical events occur about 5 minutes apart. Probably because the writers and directors couldn't keep the story going for longer bursts than that. The worst of it was the migraine inducing sounds were at least 3 times louder than the dialog. So I was constantly lowering and raising the volume on my computer while I streamed this movie.There's way more to not like about this movie (Brad Pitt's banal love interest story line for example), but the bottom line is there isn't a single thing to like about it.This movie cost $183 million? I can only assume three quarters of that was paid to Clooney, Pitt, Damon and Roberts. Because none of it went into the production.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Shoddy acting, weak plot, utterly disappointing!","I just saw this much hyped film (thanks to advance publicity, including the Diane Sawyer ABC special). Too bad, I got sucked in and wasted 8 of my precious dollars. The main story is weak, and there are too many subplots which are totally unnecessary, distracting and very annoying.It looked like the different actors of the original Ocean's 11 cut some sort of a deal with the Producers and Director whereby they were all given more screen time - there in lies the first big flaw. Second almost all of the actors didn't make any effort to deliver their characters. Often I felt that almost everyone was just reading their lines without any emotion or passion - the only exception was Catherine Zeta Jones who made a genuine effort to deliver her character of an Interpol agent. Although her various successful and magical red-handed arrests of the various team members of Daniel Ocean appeared too cheesy at times.Julia Roberts looks tired and old in most scenes; I don't understand why she couldn't have been made more presentable using make-up etc..My recommendation is to wait for the DVD which should be out in a month or two.",,Anonymous,Crime
"Despite the non-linear structure, funky soundtrack and A-list cast, there are better caper flicks out there - but it's engaging nevertheless","Ocean's Twelve reunites an A-list cast with powerhouse director Steven Soderbergh (Traffic, Erin Brockovitch) for another caper film with even more twists and turns than Soderbergh Ocean's 11 (2001), and a decidedly non-linear structure.It's been three years since the original Benedict casino heist. Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is married to Tess (Julia Roberts), Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) is an embattled hotelier, and the others are living separate lives. Unfortunately Benedict (Andy Garcia) has tracked the 11 down  he wants his money back, with interest, in 14 days or they're dead.While on reconnaissance in Amsterdam, Rusty catches up with an old flame, Europol detective Isabel (Catherine Zeta Jones), while the team's targeted by a snarky French cat burglar (Vincent Cassel). Ocean's Twelve transcends a relatively formulaic plot by re-structuring the way events are played out  no surprise considering screenwriter George Nolfi's previous offering was the non-linear indie film Timeline. On several occasions we see the results of the crime before it is carried out. As in Run, Lola, Run and, more recently, Hero, a scene often needs re-telling to arrive at the truth of the situation. And several scenes which initially seem designed only to showcase the actors' talents are later shown to have significance. All this sleight of hand might seem confusing, but the film doesn't play that way. It just reinforces how cheeky these aristocrats of the crime world really are.The soundtrack is excellent, full of Tarantino-inspired toe-tapping numbers, enough to make anyone want to turn to crime. Although the final scene is ordinary, and you may have forgotten the entire experience the following day, you'll enjoy watching Ocean's Twelve. ***/*****stars.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Second verse pretty much same as the first,"I thought Ocean's Eleven (the 2001 version) was a nice piece of star-studded fluff, basically lighthearted fun. I didn't really get into the movie until I had been to Vegas, however, and now I enjoy it quite a bit. I've also become fonder of some of the actors involved in the film (most notably Mssrs Pitt and Damon), so I looked forward to this heist film a little more than I did the first.Ocean's Twelve is pretty much second verse, same as the first  which is fine, if that's what you're in the market for. The same easy camaraderie, the same joking between pals, the same clever set ups and the same bit with fooling the audience toward the middle of the film. It all follows the first film with some minor variations, which is exactly what most people want and indeed expect in a sequel.Clooney is back as the charismatic leader of the group of thieves (who balk in a very funny scene at being referred to as 'Ocean's Eleven') who find themselves with not one nemesis in this film, but three; not only is Andy Garcia back as Terry Benedict (in a far smaller role), but Danny and the gang must contend with a 'Europol' officer out to get them, one Isabel Lahiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones) as well as competing with a fellow thief, the Nightfox (Vincent Cassel, playing, as he usually does, another smarmy prick). The entire crew returns  Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, Elliot Gould, Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, Scott Caan, etc., and there's even a sort of extended cameo for Julia Roberts.The good times roll with the gang as we get to see how each of them is spending his part of the fortune pilfered in the first movie as, one by one, Benedict tracks them down. The reunion happens fairly quickly and most of the best scenes in the film involves the group all gathered together, where everyone is bitching at one another playfully, jibing one another, and throwing out ideas. These scenes have a wonderful ad-libbed quality to them, and they carry the first hour or so of the picture, from the moment everyone realizes they're in trouble to the time they pull off their first heist together. The first hour is a pure fun treat.It's in the second hour that Ocean's Twelve wanders a bit astray. Not content with another heist, the plot puts them in competition with uber-Europrick Nightfox, who is rich, well connected, an amazing thief, etc. This whole part felt a tad contrived, and while the planning of the second heist is fun, the actual execution of it is painful. Julia Roberts comes in for a subplot so stupid and silly it seems lifted from a Wayans Brothers spoof of the genre, complete with ham-handed acting and a wholly unnecessary cameo by Bruce Willis (Pitt, Clooney, Roberts, Damon, Zeta-Jones  you don't have enough star power already?). The movie temporarily descends into pratfall comedy, away from the clever verbal jabs and situational shorthand it employed so effectively until then. It sort of recovers, but not entirely, and the movie feels a little shabby afterward (not a help that Roberts and Clooney come off as smarmy in the final confrontation with Cassel).The acting is by and large fine. Clooney takes a smaller role but he's still good. Pitt's character is deepened a little even though he too seems to have less screen time than the first one. Elliot Gould is exceedingly sharp; a lot of his one-liners are incredibly funny. Carl Reiner isn't around enough, but when he is, he's hysterical. Damon has to shoulder a lot of the load and he does so very well, playing the nervous rookie perfectly. Roberts is okay, but I so thoroughly disliked what they did with her toward the end that it's hard for me to judge. A big surprise was how sharp Catherine Zeta-Jones was, and yet how well she fit in with this established group. Isabel was a welcome addition to the movie and is give a surprising amount of backstory and depth. She really stands out, which, even though she's the only woman in the bulk of the film, is still a real feat with this cast.By and large the film is light fun, easy on the brain and the eyes, and a good fun time. Nothing especially deep, but that's never the intent. Aside from the one extended SNL-bad gig with Roberts, I would highly recommend it; that bad part was enough to make me say that it's still worth seeing, but you could maybe wait for the DVD. I don't care to be jarred out of a film so blatantly, especially one where a nice warm feeling of clever companionship had been so craftily composed in the first leg of the movie. But your mileage may vary. It's probably worth at least a matinée to see some of the biggest movie stars of the day having fun with one another.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Worth seeing,"While perhaps not quite as perfect as Ocean's 11, this movie is definitely worth seeing - especially for fans of Ocean's 11.I personally feel you almost HAVE to have seen the first movie to get total enjoyment out of this one -- they don't really spend much time in character development, because it is somewhat assumed you already know all the characters and relationships from the first movie.There are several parts of the movie that are stuck in there almost entirely just for the humor affect, but they are worth it. It will have you rolling in laughter more than once.The only problem I had with it was the periods of cinematography where, in order to show chaos, they would quickly pan person to person close-up in random manner (I see this in many movies these days) in order to give the feeling of confusion and disorder. These types of scenes on the big screen leave me feeling motion-sick, but thankfully they are short-lived.The part where the character Tess is pulled into the con is priceless for its laughs.Overall, a good, entertaining flick. Don't try to make too much out of it, or expect every part of it to make perfect sense to you. Just go with it and enjoy it.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

"They steal YOUR money, that's about it.","I can honestly say, which doesn't happen often, that I would have preferred to have just not seen this movie all together. I feel like the actors in this movie got together, realized they could do whatever they wanted and people would still come see it, and made a travesty of the first movie.The heist is these actors taking a good movie, Ocean's 11, and using a sequel to steal about $7.50 per person in theaters. The story was a real sell-out, the characters were trying to be clever for the sake of being clever, and at the end you ask yourself ""That's it?"".The majority of the movie was the actors just trying to fill up screen time. I'm sure at one time during the production they said something along the lines of ""We're short a half hour! ... no worries! We'll just remove people from the plot for no reason ... and cameos ...

Boring!!!!,"Ocean's 12, doesn't even come close to comparison with its prequel Ocean's 11. Ocean's 11 was funny and had an absolutely amazing heist, which the guys pull off amazingly.....Ocean's 12 begins, as all of you know, with Terry Benedict, tracking down all the members of Ocean's 11 (who now have the most bizarre jobs), and asks them to pay his money back with a heap of interest..... An anonymous call tips him off about the identity of Ocean's 11, and he pays them a visit and gives them 2 weeks to pay him back.....Danny Ocean feels he needs some time off, so they decide to goto Amsterdam, since they were well known in the Us, to pull off any major heist....Amsterdam incidentally is, the place where Rusty's ex girl friend, an ex-cop stays.... They do a starting job, which they feel would pay them off a little bit and buy them some time, but when they open the vault they find their object of interest already stolen and a tape stating, the fact that the night fox has been before them........Meanwhile Ocean's 12, had been visited by Rusty's ex, and they are furious about it.... Anyways they meet up with Nightfox, and they find out that he had given the tip to Benedict, since his master made a mistake to judge them as the best thieves in the world.... His master incidentally was the legendary, Van Der Woude, so the only way to make sure who is the best, is to loot a common object.....Next the movie rolls on, and apparently it seems that everything has gone wrong as Ocean's 12 fail to make the deadline for the job....But, apparently all is not what it seems, as, it appears the Nightfox got the replica, and Ocean's troupe of men got the real thing.......The drawback of this movie is the lack of a proper high tech heist, true Nightfox did good, but we want to see Ocean's 12 do the job right.... Also, the story seemed to drawn and laid off, it lacked a proper solidity and was pretty translucent..... The music was good, and so was the dialogs making you laugh in short bursts, there is more interaction between, the characters, and now that you know them better.... Linus Caldwell,Matt Damon's character plays a more important role in the movie and he brings about most of the fun..... Julia Roberts' performance is totally appalling, primarily due to the script, where she is made to play as Julia Roberts, imagine that!!! Bruce Willis gives an appearance..... but the most important of all is Catherine Zeta-Jones........If there was anyone in this movie who you'd be watching for it is her....... She was superb, with not only her looks, but also her acting was well measured, and up to the mark.....

Problem!,"Problem is a lot of who the people who hated this movie may just be missing the boat. If the Ocean thing could be called a series it's a series about style. The Rat Pack was about style. The heists are almost secondary. I suspect Soderbergh was consciously trying to make a very ""Euro"" style movie. Like 60's Euro, when down and out American actors flooded Europe to make tedious intrigue dramas. The shots, the music, even the graininess of the early scenes in Rome--it all came together for me as such. It was big laugh to me.But surely the best laugh of all was the ""Introducing Tess as Julia Roberts"", bit with Bruce Willis. It was excellent. It may not be as good as the first one there was little or no suspense to this one but it didn't matter. It was good, pretty fun.

Its a fun movie,"So I just read one of the other posts (""a lot if inside jokes"") but I could not reply. So they didn't get the Julia Roberts thing?

They were having fun, which is what film-making should be. If you go to see it, don't go in thinking it will be god's gift to heist movies. the thing that I love about this movie and the last is that the movie moves so fast that you can't stop and think about how improbable the situations are so you have to believe that they could break into the Belaggio vault or raise a building off the ground so it is at the right height to shoot something into it.

It is so bad that I got angry and took it out of the DVD player about 2/3 of the way through. At no time did any of make any sense at all. If ever there was a case where a bunch of people got together to make a sequel, with no sincere effort to produce something that anyone would want to watch, only to squeeze some more easy cash from the success of the first effort, this is definitely it. It is very clear that no one involved in this movie had any sincere intention to do anything other than make an easy dollar off of the success of Ocean's 11. Judging from the quality of the images, it was soft using some really cheap camera without any proper lighting. Just a complete and utter pile of garbage.

Looking for Col Tom Parker,"Greetings again from the darkness. Best to walk into the theatre knowing that this is Hollywood fluff and meant to be nothing but a light movie watching experience. Think Elvis movies from the 60's with hot shot director Soderberg behind the camera. Preening and posing are the norm and style over substance is required for camera time (count how many times Brad Pitt smirks). Wonderkind Soderberg uses a bit more of his ""Traffic"" style this time around with our desperate band of thieves. The hand held shots and strange angles are an attempt to provide interest to an otherwise boring project. I firmly believe Soderberg makes these movies to keep his friendships and power so that he can make the films he really wants to make. At least I hope that is why. Twelve tosses in a few more cute cameos than Eleven with Topher Grace, Albert Finney, Bruce Willis and even Jerry Weintraub making appearances. However, watching Julia Roberts play Julia Roberts is more painful than silly. The only interesting character is Vincent Cassel as Toulour, who wants to be known as the best thief. The scene in the museum is a Hip-Hop version of Catherine Zeta-Jones from ""Entrapment"". This is our second story line behind Andy Garcia seeking payback and revenge for the gang's successful hit on his casino in Eleven. Catherine Zeta-Jones is the new addition, but provides little more than another perfect face and wardrobe. Otherwise same old, same old and if you enjoyed the first, you will enjoy this one.

Too clever for its own good (6 out of 10),"This movie never had a chance of living up to its hype. First off, Ocean's Eleven was about as perfect as a Hollywood movie with big names can be these days. It would be darn near impossible for a sequel to get that close to perfection. Soderbergh would have to catch lightning in a bottle twice. And despite his awesome talents as a director, and despite the greatness of the actors who took pay cuts to make it simply because they love working with Steven and each other, it just couldn't be done.The movie was hip, fun and entertaining - just like the first one. But during the second half of the movie, it simply gets too cute and too clever for its own good. I thought the last half-hour was nothing short of ludicrous. I just couldn't buy it, as much as I wanted to.An amazing thing about the first movie was that despite all of the big names, EVERY actor stole a scene. There was Bernie Mac yelling ""Cracker,"" Don Cheadle protecting his genitals while firing off the pinch, the Mormom twins racing in Provo, etc. With Zeta-Jones, Bruce Willis (yes, Bruce Willis) and a new villain added to the mix, there just aren't enough scenes to go around. Cheadle and Mac are pretty much entirely forgotten, which is a shame because they were great in the first one.Anyhow, the movie was certainly entertaining. It just got too clever towards the end, and left me counting the number of ways they could have ended it in more believable ways.

This movie feels like a demo reel of the original except it's just not as good. There wasn't anything here to help the movie stand out.

"""Come on, he's one guy, and he's French.""","During the Summer of 2001, Ocean's Eleven, a remake, was unlike most remakes of the early 2000s. It was fresh, it was lively, it was fun to watch. Steven Soderbergh, who has directed some very heavy movies (Erin Brockovich, Traffic, Solaris) brought us two hours of con-man entertainment that had very little to do with the premise of the original Rat Pack film from the 1960s other than Danny Ocean led 10 other thieves to rip off a Vegas casino. The pace, the plot, and the fun I had while watching Ocean's Eleven made me want to see Ocean's Twelve very much, hoping this would be the movie that bucked the sequel trend of the 2000s. While I was not expecting Godfather II or The Empire Stikes Back, I was at least hoping for a serviceable sequel, one that at least kept the life and energy of the original flowing through the characters and the scenes of the movie. By now, you should be getting the feeling I didn't feel it from this sequel. While Ocean's Twelve is not a bad movie, it just does not live up its predecessor's. Perhaps it was the genius of the fun little movie Ocean's Eleven that this movie just looks so different and less entertaining. Ocean's Twelve's first mistake? They make the good guys losers in the first scenes. Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), who had $160 million stolen from him in the first movie by the band of 11, finds out who stole the money and gives them 2 weeks to return the dough, plus interest, or it's ""game over."" This gives the movie makers and excuse to send the crew to Europe, to new fancy locales with new music and characters to meet. The plot is unimportant, as it just serves to allow each character a chance to scheme and plot some impossible scenario, and the acting is solid. George Clooney knows more than he's letting on as Danny Ocean, Brad Pitt knows even more than Ocean as Rusty Ryan, Bernie Mac likes his nail salons as Frank Catten, Matt Damon shows a nice comedic touch as Linus Caldwell, and, well, I could go on about the cast, but I wont. The newest additions to the cast are Catherine Zeta-Jones as an international thief expert and Andrew Cassel as the Night Fox, the designated bad-guy in the film. His motivations are juvenile but keeps the plot moving. The ending is border-line confusing, as the ultimate motivation for everything in the movie becomes clear only after the last scene of the movie, or possibly after a repeat viewing. As I said, this is not a bad movie, especially for those who enjoy a good caper movie, but perhaps the overreaching breadth of the movie made it difficult to capture the fun little moments of Ocean's Eleven, or allow much humor, or allow the banter we saw in the 2001 movie.

Benedict wants his money back - plus interest - or else. In this milder, innocuous sequel to the 2001 film (itself a remake of the 1960 film), the Eleven-Plus-One must pull off three major robberies in Europe to satisfy Benedict.It's an intriguing premise, and yet for some reason I thought the idea was that they were going to perform all three capers at the same time, which would have been a neat feat to watch, what with the gang having only eleven members. But alas and alack, that's not how it shook down. What we do get are three separate robbery attempts, each running into greater difficulty than the previous. Kind of like the logistics of getting a whole mess o' Big Stars to rearrange their schedules so they could work on this floppy film at cut-rate prices.Danny and his boys have their work cut out for them, because they also have a rival - the Night Fox, a wealthy man-about-town who effortlessly steals, steals, steals. Seems he's the best there is, ever was, ever will be, or something like that. And he's one step ahead of Ocean all the time. Don't you just hate people like that? Meanwhile, Linus (Matt Damon) wants a larger role in the planning of heists and such, perhaps as a sidekick/apprentice to Danny and Rusty (Brad Pitt). Why director Steven Soderbergh thought Linus needed more screen time is beyond me; the whole secondary plot of the misfit Linus trying to assert himself seemed a bit out of place - and quite a bit of a stretch for Movie Star Matt Damon.Which kind of brings me to another slightly annoying aspect of the movie - all the Movie Stars. Sure, I know they all took way-smaller salaries to work on this film, and bravo to them. But you could never get away from the fact that this was a star-studded affair, something a little above Battle of the Network Stars but not quite as good as, say, Chicago. Pitt and Clooney usurp most of the screen time anyway, although Damon and Julia Roberts are a close second. Luckily, there are plenty of other familiar faces: Elliot Gould, Don Cheadle, Carl Reiner, Scott Caan, Casey Affleck ... Oh, and did I mention Catherine Zeta-Jones? She's an intrepid Interpol agent who shares a past with Rusty, and she's hot on the trail of the Ocean Gang. Unfortunately, she's a bit underused, although a late subplot about her works fine, although it seems shoehorned in.The plot gets a little complicated at times, and you might well ask yourself, ""Where are they now? Why are they doing that?"" and so forth. I liked the intricacies of the plot of the 2001 film, but for some reason this script left me a little cold. Complex is fine, but the plot still needs to draw you in, and it just didn't do so this time around.The first half of the movie kind of dragged a bit for me, but I'm glad I stuck with it. In the second half, there are a couple of excellent cameos - both surprises to me - and some clever twists indeed. The action in the latter half of the movie did make up for the torpidity (look it up!) of the first half. Kudos to George Nolfi's script, albeit somewhat grudgingly.The acting isn't bad at all; in fact, the players all seem to be enjoying themselves immensely, which is kind of what all-star movies are all about.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"One-minded, bandwagoners and their negative reviews.","The same sort of people who think the original three Star Wars movies were groundbreaking works of pure art, while thinking the prequel reboots were utter garbage, but didn't adopt that opinion until they caught wind of it as the popular consensus of the zeitgeist, are the same people that despise this film. The margin of difference and quality between the original Star Wars trilogy and the prequels is far smaller than people seem to think. And that was the consensus of Star Wars fans at first. It took a couple years of fan forums and reddit pages to build such an exaggerated hatred of the Star Wars prequels, which began ironically and evolved into actual hatred. The same can be said, I think for Oceans 12. Of course it wasn't as good as 11 and no one expected it to be. Part of the reason 11 is so good is that all the styles and motifs, even the screenwriting, was brand new to everyone. Newness plays a huge factor in how large a place 11 holds in our hearts. If 11 had never been made and 12 were a standalone movie (assuming the backstory was explained and all), I guarantee all these people giving 1 star reviews would be giving 8s or 9s. Oceans 12 is a great movie. It's only slightly less great than 11 and 13. And all these people spewing nonsense like ""it insulted my intelligence"", first of all, get over yourselves, and secondly, you weren't as shocked or impressed with the twists and turns because you had already seen Oceans 11 and were specifically looking for them and trying to figure them out! Again, if Oceans 12 was a stand-alone movie, you all would have loved it. You're all just lemmings following the afactual and wrongly reasoned opinion of the zeitgeist.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A fun movie worth a few viewings,"I think it is easy to be over critical of this movie. Sure, there were a few plot holes that left me scratching my head, and at times the camera and/or lighting seemed a little out of place.But who cares? In this movie that's not the point. What really matters is that it follows the same theme as it's predecessor: It's a hip and fun movie that left me smiling through out the whole thing. I love the interaction between Clooney and Pitt, and Damon's role is great. I haven't had so much fun watching a movie in a long while. And Julia Roberts actually puts up an OK job. I felt she was the weakest link in Eleven, but in this one I didn't sense that at all, though it also helped that her role this time along was a bit easier to play.My only gripes were that Bernie Mac's role was significantly smaller (though not large in the Ocean's Eleven either), and some cheesy high-tech stuff (anyone who as seen it knows what I'm talking about).Other than that, I loved it. 9/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A Good ""Fun"" Film","Ocean's 12 ***/****""Ocean's Twelve"" is a heist/comedy/action film about twelve thieves who must pay back casino owner, Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) the 160 million dollars that they stole from him in the prequel, ""Ocean's Eleven."" Although Benedict's stolen money was fully compensated by insurance, he seeks revenge and his 160 million dollars back from Danny Ocean, (George Clooney) and his eleven friends.The plot takes off right away when Benedict comes to Ocean's house demanding his 160 million dollars back in two weeks. The eleven thieves, led by Danny immediately assemble and discuss how they will come up with the 160 million dollars in two weeks. The funny thing is that at no time did any person suggest the idea of not paying Benedict back his money. After all they are thieves, and thieves steal things. But after the victim they stole from requests his money back, it is instantly assumed by all eleven thieves that they must pay him back? ""Ocean's Twelve"" has many plot holes and problems such as the one described above. But ""Ocean's Twelve"" isn't about a strong plot. What makes ""Ocean's Twelve"" worth watching is the star power, ""cool style,"" plot twists, and funny witty lines, and characters.Director Steven Soderbergh does a remarkable job of developing and portraying all of the twelve thieves (and several others) throughout the film. Each thief has a specialized area of expertise and a unique and often exaggerated and humorous character. For example Linus (Matt Damon) is the uptight, ambitious, nerdy but cool character who makes several funny and ironic comments in the film. At one point Linus comments to the other ten thieves, ""I don't think we have to be the kind of organization that labels people."" This statement is later followed up by a humorous discussion where Linus defends his morals and the rest of the group ridicules him.As the film progresses many subplots and plot twists unwind. Some are very clever and interesting, but each plot twist and subplot drags the film further away from a strong working plot.If you can put aside the complicated shaky plot and go with the flow of the movie, you will be able to enjoy the charm of the characters and the ""cool"" atmosphere of the entire film as a whole.To get the most entertainment out of ""Ocean's Twelve,"" focus not on what the character's are doing and stealing, but how they steal things and what they say and do in the process. ""Ocean's Twelve"" is not a masterpiece, however it is fun and entertaining if you play along with it and let it be.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
The heist film lives on.,"The heist film lives on every time a slick gang of bad boys and girls gathers to take something that doesn't belong to them, and we go along because these crooks are 'cool.' Three years ago in the very watchable Heist, Gene Hackman was a rough but competent jewel thief aided by the usual gang of helpers conning nasty fence Danny DeVito of his ill-gotten gains. That was then and the literate David Mamet (Spartan) was director. Steven Soderbergh's Ocean's Eleven came out that same year, a smooth caper film with hip actors such as George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, and Matt Damon stealing a cool $150 million from casino owner Andy Garcia. Heist was a better character study; Ocean's Eleven was more fun.Ocean's Twelve brings back the same relaxed thieves plus Catherine Zeta-Jones in a more complicated project, three European robberies culminating in stealing a Faberge egg to assuage the vengeful anger of Andy Garcia's casino owner. Europe, especially the wide-open and beautiful Amsterdam, looks as inviting as ever, though Chris Connier's cinematography (Angela's Ashes) is nothing to write home about. The actors seem jet-lagged and the plot weary from trying to be ingenious and new while it is really tired and old.More intriguing than the de rigueur fashion clothes for this series is the addition of Vincent Cassel (Birthday Girl) as Francois Toulour, the superior thief arguably better than Danny Ocean but still not as good as the world's best, LeMarc (Albert Finney). Cassel's savoir-faire and dance among the museum's laser beams are welcome relief from the clichés of Clooney and gang.But continuing to enjoy even the most modest of heist films such as Ocean's Twelve, I come out of the theater with a smile although my admission dollars were stolen. As Shakespeare said in Othello, 'The robb'd that smiles, steals something from the thief.'I want to go back to Amsterdam but not with tired thieves. Give me an old but young Gene Hackman and a plot to keep the jet lag at bay.",,Anonymous,Crime
"Irregular, the work does not hold the viewer as much as the film that precedes it, even though there is a smooth in the midst of so much lack of rhythm","After the reunion of stars of the original film, which was well received by audiences and expert critics, Steven Soderbergh returns to satisfy the studio's desires and try to earn even more. Not just another secret, but also twice as many love complications, twice as many unusual strokes, twice as much food ingested by Brad Pitt, internal twists and jokes elevated to the umpteenth power. If you liked the lint of conciseness in the 2001 film, forget it. What counts here is megalomania. Whoever is going to watch the Ocean's Twelve hoping to see a serious, audacious and imposing film, up to the status of those involved, is a mistake. Here they are meeting with a single objective: to have fun. It is lucky for the viewer to understand this immediately and enjoy the game as it should.Ocean's Twelve is a legitimate slot machine, but with the honesty of those who assume their condition from the beginning. This work does not aim to sell anything other than what I offer in a very open way: something light and disposable. On the other hand, entertainment is accurate, fun is competent, and the cost / benefit ratio is interesting on both sides of the issue: those who did it and those who watch it. Starting with the first robbery that Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his eleven cronies plan in Europe to make up for the money they took from Terry Benedict's (Andy Garcia) casinos and now they will have to return it. The target is a mansion in Amsterdam. Why lower a simple wall when you can erect an entire building through the submerged canals of the Dutch metropolis? And look, this is just the beginning ... A talented rival thief (played by Vincent Cassel) and a beautiful detective (Catherine Zeta-Jones) will still get in the way. Exaggerations and verisimilitudes aside, director Steven Soderbergh knows that the public only cares about seeing their favorite stars in action.How does a sequence that proposes to be more complex and provocative end up being worse than the predecessor film? How does a work with such a stellar cast manage to add the beautiful, charming and beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones and, even so, end up being unable to improve the fascinating charm of the first film? The answer may seem simple, but it is just simple: Las Vegas, or rather, the absence of the city. What is most at odds with the tone of the first film, however, ends up being the European setting. In small, cloudy Amsterdam there is not much room for air and the wealth of possibilities in the vast desert of Vegas. Of course, as the plot takes place in Europe, the locations are beautiful, as well as the internal scenarios. It is worth mentioning the Toulour mansion, a place that breathes history behind each sculpture, painting, detail, in short. The same goes for the museum where the Fabergé egg is exhibited, with an architecture full of golden tones and rich in details.Taking place in Amsterdam and Rome, basically, it is almost completely impersonal and contemplative compared to the focused and convinced Eleven Men and a Secret. The even more intricate plot begins very well with Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) chasing one thief at a time. Soderbergh manages to repeat the dose of the first film by taking care of the personalities of each member in these quick shots. In a comical and creative montage, the owner of Bellagio finally takes his revenge, proposing two weeks for the Daniel Ocean (George Clooney) gang to pay what they owe with due interest.The film, at first, follows the same course of the previous one in almost all aspects, however, we soon realized that, this time, luck will not be so in favor of our dear bandits. Toulour proves to be a kind of ""double agent"", making the plot look like a big game of thief against thief, where the one who deceives the other better wins. At this point, the script is efficient in holding the viewer's attention, even if using a less accelerated pace. The negative side comes with the turning point, which only happens in the final 20 minutes of the film, giving a feeling of randomness and a poorly worked idea, a feeling totally opposite to the previous work.The film has good times. What about Linus' (Matt Damon) desperate Kashmir recitation in the possibly most hilarious scene in the entire trilogy. In addition to this, there are other memorable parts, although unable to sustain the entire film. Julia Roberts playing Tess playing Julia Roberts is an example of an idea that gets better with each audience. Vincent Cassel, making the most stereotyped arrogant and cynical Frenchman in history, is another full plate: his dance among lasers is exaggerated, but with Thé à la menthe it becomes another long-lived passage. Speaking of tracks, how can you not fall in love with Catherine Zeta-Jones smiling to the sound of Crepuscolo Sul Mare, by Piero Umiliani? In fact, go up the screen and ask yourself, dear reader: how can you not fall in love with Catherine Zeta-Jones, quite simply?We can see, at the end of the plot, several problems caused so that this is not a sequence of the same level as the original. One of them is the number of subplots that take place in the film, which are poorly developed. Director Steven Soderbergh and screenwriter George Nolfi tried to create interactivity between the film's events with the audience, but it rarely works. Those signs are boring and often confuse the viewer. In the first film we felt like we were in the group: coming up, acting and stealing. In this one, the director chose to show more details as a romance between the characters of Brad Pitt and Zeta-Jones; parallel stories (you will know little about the greatest thief of all time) and thefts shown in little detail (in the form of flashbacks, most of the time). The ""preparation"" scenes of the robberies (the pre-execution) did not totally lose their grace, but suffered a conceptual loss. The executions of the actions themselves, during all the passages in which this occurred, were very disappointing. The script makes it clear that, if Ocean is the protagonist of the first film, surely the second is Rusty (Brad Pitt) who gains more prominence, even for following the cue given by Tess (Julia Roberts) at the end of the first: they got a girl for the blonde. Lahiri (Zeta-Jones) is the tough and strict police officer who does not hesitate to forge a signature here and there to hunt down the bad guys. Another example of how the subtlety of the actors' expression dictates the tone of the entire film.With an atmosphere of sour epilogue, the film still adds layer upon layer to its plot. Blink and lose, it's simple. This is not a negative factor in itself, but it does little to help with three changes of plans from the middle to the end: all the fluidity that echoes in Eleven Men is abandoned here by a desperate effort to appear smarter and less cool than in the first feature. The icing on the cake is the sudden appearance of Linus' mother and another character, serving as dei ex machina. Soderbergh calls the audience a muggle for his unnecessary preoccupation with a plan that was essentially fake for half the film.A good point that can be highlighted is that in this film the director demands more of the viewer's reasoning, since previously, the emotional spoke louder. Therefore, some people may not like it. Although there are some jokes or scenes characteristic of old films (songs with classic styles and camera shots with close-ups and landscapes), which does not make the film a sleep aid. If you notice, there is no physical combat during the entire exhibition (showing that you can entertain without using violence). This only strengthens even more that the director wanted to put the viewer to think, mainly because even some jokes are more intelligent. The actors took advantage of their charisma to turn this film into a comedy, rather than an action feature. They have the capacity to do this, after all, together, they are the biggest Hollywood cache circulation. In the troupe of thieves, there are many supporting actors who only enhance production, such as the confused Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon); the Chinese Yen (Shaobo Qin); brothers Virgil (Casey Affleck) and Tuck (Scott Caan); and the vain Frank (Bernie Mac). We also have the musician Basher (Don Cheadle), the old Saul (Carl Reiner), the accommodated Livingston (Eddie Jemison) and the investor Reuben (Elliott Gould), completing the cast. Not to mention that there is an edge with Bruce Willis (playing himself) in one of the best passages in the film. These are the things that make this film interesting, because if there was no such humor, it would be a totally disposable production, even with all the intellectual context and stellar cast.Finally, a bigger crime could not be what they did with Andy Garcia's character, the almighty Benedict. They simply relegated the phenomenal character of the first film to a mere supporting role in the beginning of production, where we later discovered that we were working for (or with) third parties. That was simply unforgivable. He considered Benedict one of the best characters in the first film. Quite an antagonist. Unfortunately, we also found that it was not just Andy Garcia who disappeared from production. Several brilliant supporting actors in the first film had rare appearances or passages in which they rarely did anything really useful for the story's progress.Ocean's Twelve is competent in its intentions and as an entertainment product it is a very reasonable option. Indicated to relax your head and just enjoy. And although it leaves a crack open for lamentation, since with so many talents around you could expect something more consistent, at least it kept the interest in the series up, guaranteeing a third episode to close the trilogy. Irregular, the work does not hold the viewer as much as the film that precedes it, even though there is a smooth and commendable thematic study in the midst of so much lack of rhythm.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Come on, it wasn't that bad!","After reading a couple of the user summaries and having a look at most of the titles, I am quite disappointed to see how much people gave negative comments towards Ocean's Twelve. Personally, I think that the plot was well thought of. I was a bit confused at the end, but it didn't take away to my enjoyment of the movie as a whole. And after discussing it with others or seeing it a second time, you get the point (it's not pointless). It is really important to discuss these kind of movies with others after the viewing, it's inevitable! Cause others may have noticed things you haven't! Of course, if we compare it to Ocean's Eleven, we must take in consideration that sequels aren't normally as good as the first one. Also, the last time I saw Ocean's 11 is a while back, and at that time had no actual knowledge of movie-making. Now that I've had film study and had to watch Ocean's Twelve twice to analyze it, I've come to enjoy it a lot. Everything in it is so well organized and thought out. From camera angles, to camera shots and the interaction of these shots, as well as the scenes themselves, the mise-en-scene and the montage... all is in accordance to make that movie beautiful.I must say that I'm not personally a huge fan of the Oceans movies, but nonetheless I loved these movies, and I don't think that Ocean's 12 was a bad sequel. It followed the idea of the first movie, and it was brilliantly done; a different story was introduced so as not to repeat anything from Ocean's 11. I think that involving a new character added to the intrigue, and we could obviously see that the cast worked well together. It's amazing how all these great celebrities worked well together with no one in particular who stole the show.All in all, I don't think that it was justified to criticize Ocean's 12 that much, because on a technical point of view, it wasn't the best, but it was still brilliantly done. Everything in the movie fit except for the scene with Matsui, which was quite disturbing but in the end I guess it all makes sense! (Still haven't discussed that one yet). Anyways, watching this movie or any movie with high expectations ruins it, so please save those negative comments for some movies that really deserve it! =P",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Ocean's Twelve...or Thirteen...or Seventeen...whatever,"""Ocean's Eleven"" is one of my favorite recent movies, as it seamlessly excels in nearly every aspect of film-making. So of course I eagerly anticipated the release of this sequel, ""Ocean's Twelve"", although I did not expect a movie that matched up to the superb original.All of the actors and characters from that first film are back. The premise picks up about a year after the conclusion of ""Eleven"", as Andy Garcia's villainous Terry Benedict is hunting down the men who robbed him. He threatens harm if they don't refund his money, so the eleven must reunite to pull another heist, this time in Europe.Infused with Soderburgh's brilliant cinematography, the first film was a smooth, sleek Hollywood production. The look matched the tone of the smooth, sleek caper pulled by the always-in-control titular crew. ""Ocean's Twelve"" has a drastically different feel, as the classic subdued beauty of Europe substitutes for the modern flashiness of Las Vegas. As everyone hops around the continent, the singularity of the first film is almost recklessly replaced by the atmosphere of various countries. Initially bothersome, this tone eventually clicks with the characters, who themselves are less of a machine than before. The end result has the feel of an independent film, like something a bunch of friends made while partying, but with a $110 million budget. Of course from all reports that isn't far from the truth. The good news is that the congenial atmosphere produces a movie that oozes amicability. But even that sense of camaraderie cannot mask the deficiencies elsewhere in the picture.Most missed is the saavy overall film-making of the original. Whether it be the lack of creative shots (except for a plane landing) or the not-quite-as-crisp dialogue (throwaway lines in particular), Twelve simply isn't as much fun as the original. Granted, that's a high bar to clear, and the sequel is still better than most, but comparisons are inevitable. The Venetian blind wipes and clever use of titles spice things up; the actors' delivery is still timely; and small touches like the Boston-New York thing still shine, but ultimately the script doesn't quite measure up to the original. Instead of a tight and driving story that hoodwinks but explains fully and logically, Twelve utilizes two dei ex machina (or di or machinis or however the phrase is pluralized) that are not adequately buttressed, leaving the viewer feeling not robbed, but a little cheated.""Eleven"" was a popcorn film, if there is such a thing, while ""Twelve"" is more of a popcorn movie, meaning that is isn't as crisp or cohesive from a cinematic angle. Perhaps this was an purposeful choice intended to reflect the more haphazard nature of the story, but the method does not succeed as wildly.Bottom Line: Entertaining but not quite as satisfying as the original, ""Ocean's Twelve"" is still better than most movies, worth a few bucks and a couple hours. 7 of 10.As a side question, any thoughts on which character was the titular twelfth? I think there is an easy answer, but I'm not sure it's the right one. In fact, I don't have an definite opinion. I posit that it's just a silly sequel title.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
just as good as oceans 11,"It can be said that I am addicted to movies, and 7 is a pretty high rating in the scheme of things.

As far as I'm concerned this was the worst aspect of the movie, the acting was great not spectacular but great. I especially like the french actor, Vincent Cassel. The overall film and storyline was great, some of it was predictable some of it wasn't. There were great sequences like Vincent Cassel's laser beam part. I particularly didn't like that part about Julia Roberts, it obviously wasn't a part of the original story. Overall 1.

"NOT BAD, BUT NOT GREAT. Another sequel too rushed! Style over substance.","Its just opened here in Australia. Here are my thoughts.1. Not a bad caper movie, and although the first was excellent, a sequel was not really necessary or asked for by audiences.2. Julia Roberts is in the first 2 minutes of the film, then shows up for the last 10 minutes or so. She really is just thrown in there to add to box office & pick up a big paycheck for very little work. Did anyone else think she looked very skinny and unattractive in much of her scenes? She has definitely lost a lot of Hollywood clout i feel. The whole storyline of her playing *******SPOILERS**************Julia Roberts! was funny at first, but tired quickly, and the whole Bruce Willis thing seemed to drag out.3. The storyline in general was very weak, and many of the jokes fell flat and just were not funny. I think they loved hanging out, George wanted to have parties in his waterfront mansion in italy, so it seemed like a good idea to film in europe, all cast hang out cause they are best mates, then make a fortune on a poorly thought out script & story.4.Bernie Mac was completely wasted. Why is Hollywood putting a great comedian in such a minimal role & non-funny scenes such as this (and mr 3000). listen up movie exec's BERNIE MAC IS A COMEDIAN - let him shine & do what he does best - WHICH IS MAKE PEOPLE LAUGH !5.

Puts the first one to shame!,"The sequel to Ocean's Eleven is dreadful. Let's look at the first one, it was funny, interesting, and had some unique characters. In this one, the magic of the first one is stripped away. It's unfunny, it's uninteresting, and you don't even see most of the characters for more than a minute. It begins with Terry Benedict(Garcia), the villain from the first one, going around acting cool while letting the Ocean's Eleven know that they had two weeks in which to return his money with interest or he would have them killed. The team then goes to Amsterdam to try to get rich. They are then confronted by a good thief who calls himself the Nightfox(Cassel), who thinks he's better than the eleven and challenges them to a thief duel. First off, what a crappy plot, it is also dreadfully predictable. While watching, you don't connect with any of the characters and any so called ""fun"" that you are supposed to have is ruined by terrible camera work, annoying music, and annoying transitions. If that's not enough to make you reconsider and see a good film like Finding Neverland, then you'll be in for a treat. Perhaps the worst thing about this disaster is that in the middle of the film, in a failed attempt to have some laughs, Julia Roberts has to play Julia Roberts in a heist operation. And if that's not bad enough, they also hide a pillow underneath her shirt to try to make her look pregnant and have Bruce Willis in a cameo playing himself meet up with her and that add to the chaos.

To me they have all fallen a little short and although normally I don't like star-studded sequels I have to say Oceans Twelve is just a plain old fun movie that you have to like. It came just in time, when movies start to really take themselves seriously for the Oscars, to lighten the mood. As far as a heist movie goes there have been better, the heists in Ronin, Heat and oceans eleven out shine Oceans twelve's heist, but comically this one out shines Oceans Eleven Meat the Fockers. A fun movie during a not so fun movie season, personally I'm hoping for an Ocean's trilogy.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

The one thing for me was Catherine Zeta Jones (why have her in it?) She can't act!She used to be able to but now...oh no!If she had stayed in the UK she might have learned a lot more about acting. She used to be good. She's too fake.Julia Roberts is far superior in acting, and can even send herself up, and that is true acting.Apart from CZJ it was a great film.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Messed up in storyline.,"Like everyone else, I rented ""Ocean's Twelve"" with high anticipation after watching ""eleven"". It would be rude to say that my hope is totally crushed or I thought this film is total crap, but certainly in terms of story and screenplay, it comes nowhere near its prequel. The story is too much complex from beginning to end as if the writer had too many things in his mind but never quite used them properly. I asked myself ""What's going on?"" a number of times during the film but didn't get a satisfactory answer in the end.Still, the film has the original's stylish film-making, with innovative and interesting camera angles. It has got more star-studded cast including an enjoyable cameo by Bruce Willis as himself. The new starring role by Catherine Zeta-Jones is definitely one of the reasons one should however watch the film. Her looks, attitude and very comfortable performance are this film's valuable assets. But to tell the truth, when you've got a completely messed up story such as this, stars cannot save you.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
slick and extremely clever,this film was one of the best films i have ever seen!!!! The plot follows the ocean 11 group who have to make 128 million to pay back the guy they robbed off in the first one. This film is definitely worth going to watch. EVen if you did not see the first one go see it. Even the movie is worth going to watch just to see the laser grid scene. In some parts the film it does get boring but there is always a good part to keep from dying of boredom. The film also follows a story of a police officer who's dad was one of the worlds best cat burglar. go see it!!! it will be worth your money!!!! some people may say that the first one was better but this one is definitely better.,9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""Fox vs Finesse""","Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend, at least for fans of heist movies.This is a refreshing twist on heist movies, actually a combination of twists: payback revenge and criminal vs criminal. This qualifies alternative motive to the crimes and because of the high stakes of competing thieves, we certainly get a complex heist.The problem with this movie is that Benedict's move against them is the most interesting part, but is relegated to the beginning of the movie. Most of the thief vs thief action is obscured to hide information from the audience, causing the movie to explain and even re-explain things that have, are, or will happen in the movie which, honestly, just pads the run time without making the movie more entertaining.Without a doubt, the movie is still good, but not nearly as good as the first in the series.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

I am generally not a fan of Zeta-Jones but even I must admit that Kate is STUNNING in this movie. It's ending screams of an upcoming trequel and I will be one of the millions who flock to see 120 minutes of George and Brad and Matt parlay through Clooney's digs in Lago di Como as they swindle some rich bad guy again and again.

Ocean's Twelve = Absolutely terrible (with reasons included),"Okay well you must be asking yourself? WHY WHY WHY?! Well the first half of the movie makes you think that you are going to end up with a awesome storyline with twists and subplots... nope. At least in the start of the movie you'll partly believe that something is being hidden, a subplot if you must. I watched it all the way to the end waiting, and when the credits started rolling I was still waiting. I borrowed this movie off a friend before he had watched it. I was vocal on how bad the movie actually was and I explained the worst parts of the movie and still to this day he has it, but still hasn't watched it. The worst part, this: Julia Roberts plays Tess Ocean, Danny Ocean's (George clooney's) wife within the actual movie. The real problem with this is, a scene which Tess Ocean dresses up in different clothes and looks like she is pregnant, to disguise as ""Julia Roberts"" within the movie. This calls the entire storyline & cast into question, she is pretending to be herself within a movie, even a Bruce Willis's cameo just added more confusion. If you have 2 hours spare and all you're dvds catch fire except ocean's twelve, STILL Don't WATCH IT.

"The best sequel to a remake since ""Father of the Bride II"" (I mean that as a compliment)","""Ocean's Twelve"" is an interesting film to consider, and has many reasons to like it and many reasons to dislike it. Pros include the superb cast and the breezy and entertaining way in which Steven Soderbergh shoots the film. The Cons center around the plotting, which is often hard to believe. Whether or not you like the movie depends on which you value more: superficial entertainment value and beautiful people, or a plot (if the latter, you must not enjoy many movies). I personally was very entertained by the movie. The cast was what made the film, especially Catherine Zeta-Jones, Matt Damon, and Julia Roberts. Zeta-Jones is the main newcomer, and does very well, not to mention being extremely sexy. Matt Damon and Julia Roberts provide the most laughs; Roberts in particular has a hysterical sequence where her character Tess is called upon to impersonate Julia Roberts. I give the film an 8/10. If, while promoting ""Ocean's Twelve"", Soderbergh in taken by a particular location and decides to do ""Ocean's Thirteen"", count me in.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Not for everyone but I really enjoyed it,I just returned from seeing Ocean's Twelve with my friend. Upon leaving the movie it became very apparent that we had very different opinions on the movie. My friend was not impressed. I on the other hand thought it was very funny. If you go see the movie make sure you know what you are getting into. This not a purely suspense movie. Its a throw back to the screw ball capers of the 50's and 60's. Its all about having fun and doing things with flare. The plot is very over the top and that's what makes it enjoyable.

You seemed to know the entire time that there is no way these ""best robbers in the world"" got themselves into this much trouble, and the who Julia Roberts joke, although kinda cute, was a bit over done.

Ultimately Flawed,"I wasn't totally sure of how I would react to this film in terms of 'opinion on quality' as I hadn't seen the first film. Whether or not that would prove to be my downfall or not was just one of those things at the back of my mind telling me I might not enjoy this as much as I think I would've had it been the first film. As it turned out, I didn't enjoy as much as I estimated I would've.The film has quite a large cast and many of the actors/actresses are back from the first film I discovered so in terms of presenting the characters and all round acting in general, I thought that it wouldn't have been very different to that of the first film. As it was, the acting was good with a fine nervous performance from Damon's character and Clooney and Pitt also do their best.The humour is also just about up to standard. It's thrown in there amongst the pretty dismal plot where they try to make something relatively simple, uncontrollably difficult which not only falls on it's face but leaves bruise marks for all to see when it try's to get back up again. That saying, the jokes do roll along rather nicely and just manage to crop up at the right times giving the film a nice 'timed' feel to it. The Julia Robert's 'sketch' was quite a breath of fresh air in amongst all the confusion. It slowed everything right down and gave me not only a chance to catch my breath but to enjoy a rather surreal scene involving both real, fake and fake-real actors/actresses. Good stuff.Of course with all the good acting, funny jokes and such aside; film's rely on plots and this one, as mentioned above, didn't really impress me. As I say, it try's to make something difficult when it was quite simple to start off with. It starts off all well and good with the 're-aquiring' of the gang but generally starts to fall away as it looses ground on people. They've obviously gone for the bold option here and credit to them for trying but it just didn't float my boat.If decimals were a part of IMDb's voting system, then it would've been slightly higher than a six out of ten but in this case, the film deserves to be rounded down.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

How can a movie with so many big name stars... u know,"As many of you know, this movie's cast includes many of Hollywood's big name stars. Julia Roberts, Brad Pit, George Cloony, Bernie Mac, Matt Damon and many more famous actors have all been in this unsatisfactory movie. After the first movie, I expected a decent sequel which would not, although it kind of did, make my face go ""(-__-).""The overall plot seemed like an unsuccessful imitation of the first's. The movie included many aspects of the first movie including a ""suspense' built up before a job was pulled off, and a ""surprising twist"" at the end, which didn't make much sense to me. To avoid spoiling the movie for those unfortunate souls who have decided to watch this movie before seeing the third in the series, which I have yet to watch, I will not say what this ""twist"" is. However, I will say that after seeing what happened I couldn't help but wonder why the gang did certain things if that was so.Anyways, this movie did not meet my expectations, but I ill say it wasn't complete trash because there still were some funny parts in it and i certainly enjoyed the part where Toulour listens to music while... you know. That part was totally awesome and I watched that part a couple times over because it was that awesome.

Nice Entertainment,"I am a bit exasperated and even a little disappointed at the mixed reviews for ""Ocean's Twelve"". The 60% score registered on RottenTomatoes' scale works as well as any to reflect the division within critics' ranks. Generally these are the films most worth viewing to determine how in the world such a large spread of opinion exists.Unless I am mistaken, the adult American moviegoer is a relatively well informed consumer. To that point, I cannot recall a single moment in any of the pre-release marketing blitz for ""Ocean's Twelve"" that indicated we had Oscar-contending material, great emotive acting or social impact/political value here. And since this is essentially ""O.E. II"" what major surprise might it be that what we have here is a great goof? Let's examine some facts.The plot: Terry Benedict (we are treated to another Andy Garcia portrayal), victimized Bellagio owner of the first movie, wants his money backwith interest. He leans, in succession, on all the original members of Danny Ocean's (George Clooney) eleven teammates. And of course the note is due in an impossible time frame. A lot of cash will need to be stolen, and fast. So the original ""O.E."" team needs to be reassembled to pull some more capers.What the team also finds out in short order is that not only are they being tailed by a resourceful (and strikingly  Katherine Zeta-Jones) international policeman but are also threatened by a master thief (Vincent Cassel as Francois) that wants to top them in every way. So our boys have to buck up and try and fend off all manner of adversity as they pursue their less than honorable  ""does anyone have any moral issues about this?"" is asked early on  goals.This is not a flick filled with Bond-like gadgets or even the usual heist-focused set ups. But there is just enough of that to whet the appetite. The elaborate set up in their first caper, beginning with a shot of a sailboat at anchor and then penetrating it's eerie appearance to see what is going on below gives just enough of a head scratching high-tech look (and isn't it all about ""the look""?) to satisfy.One-liners and quips are expected and by rights a necessity not overlooked in ""Ocean's Twelve"". And knowing glances. Lots of glances. Let's face it; this really is a hip collection of talented individuals. Most of us aren't, couldn't be and probably don't even know one. Well, here is a whole room full. I suspect most critics are jealous; always have.Listen to Elliot Gould's line when surprised at an interruption during his visit to a fortune teller. Watch K. Zeta-Jones turn in the only real emotional scene. It is actually quite touching. Having played the somewhat hard-bitten and driven law enforcement pro, she offers a bit of vulnerability for us to savor. See Brad Pitt grimace when he finds he's made a mistake.Check out two interviews (there are many available) to share the sheer fun these stars have and consider how lucky we are for their collaboration. See what George Clooney says (http://www.darkhorizons.com/news04/ocean1.php) about caper movies. Better yet, check out the ensemble interview at http://home.hamptonroads.com/stories/story.cfm?story=79148&ran=247675 in which we sense the fun this group had and continues to have.In all, we are offered what we expect  a smart caper film with some of the best in Hollywood delivering the goods. There is no political message here, no social axe ground nor remarkable signature or auteur offered; I trust you to relegate those criticisms for the art-house films and the annual launch of Oscar contenders as 2004 winds down. What we have here is a nice entertainment for the holiday season!Rating: 3-1/4 Stars.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Pretty and vacant...,"First off I only recently saw the remake of Oceans Eleven (not really wanting to see Hollywood try and recreate the cool of the Ratpack, cheapening the whole project) and was pleasantly surprised at how slick and charming it was. The acting was spot on, the direction and camera-work brilliant and the old story as smooth as before.So when I heard Oceans Twelve was poor beyond belief from Jonny Ross (BBC Film 2005) I was disappointed but not devastated. Finding myself in a Cardiff cinema with my funky Free Movies card and nothing else to see, my cousin and I took the leap and stepped into the darkened theatre awaiting with interest to see exactly where they went wrong.At first it seemed equally as good as it's predecessor. The visuals were awesome (really great work with colours and long edits) and the actors still looked like they really did know each other like the characters supposedly did.Then, about 50 minutes into the film, it happened.A plot swing that would not feel out of place on Ant and Dec style Saturday morning TV. The worst idea in movie history? Possibly. The next twenty minutes was cringe-worthy... absolutely horrible. And after this was over, the bad taste remained in your mouth like the bile from a recent vomiting session.So although I feel Jonathan Ross was over harsh, he was ultimately right - this is a bad film.

Some of the actors don't really get much screen time, it's just like the red carpet at a premiere, everyone smiles but with no content.In fact the series of heists that take place here are always on the edge of being too confusing, it's exciting to watch, but in the end thinking of it, it seem more like chaos hiding the lack of a solid story.This series of discontinuity has its climax in the style of the film.

But it was the big mistake!!You can have the great crew ,pretty acting with many big fishes but without the story and ideas - it all goes to the blind end. For me far beyond the disappointing point. It looks to me that it was just purely calculated as a cash well. Maybe someone seeing all the stars just acting is satisfied with the film but not me - it is not enough - particularly in this kind of movie.So the conclusion for the ""average"" audience ( from my point of view ): The big names really don't ensure the valuable or relaxing experience. But as I said before maybe it is caused by my personal demands. And to clear up my high vote rate - I'm just a mild critic.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Overdone sequel but still good and enjoyable enough.,"The first ""Ocean's Eleven"" was probably one of the most entertaining and clever heist movies that I had ever seen, so in that light ""Ocean's Twelve"" is a disappointment but does that also make this a bad movie? Of course not!The movie uses basically all of the same ingredients and all of the same characters, with added this time even more characters. Also the stories get more complicated but complicated in this case doesn't mean more clever. No, actually the story this time isn't much special and also nothing too spectacular to be honest. The movie is really lacking one clear main point, or heist in this case, that it is build up to.It's not necessarily that much of a confusing movie to watch but it is one that feels a bit messy and disjointed, since its set in multiple different countries this time and not all of the characters are always together as a team. On top of that, the story also isn't always told chronologically and features quite some flashbacks in it. They were perhaps just trying too hard to top the first movie, which instead backfired at them.To be honest the movie to me was a perfectly fun and watchable one for its first hour or so but after that things start to go downhill with its story, which also really goes eventually at the expense of the movie its entertainment value. It makes the movie even feel overlong, while it actually is only just a normal average 2 hours long.They also perhaps too desperately tried to shoehorn in every character from the first movie into this one. In the first movie Danny Ocean's eleven each served a purpose within the story because of their special skills, while in this movie their skills really aren't that relevant for them, since they don't put them to use. No, half of the characters could had easily been cut from its script but in that case we wouldn't had had a ""Ocean's Twelve"" of course. But it also makes it all the more unnecessary that new characters, played by well known actors, get introduced in this movie.Sure, it's all still good fun seeing all of these big names acting together in one movie, also since they themselves obviously were having fun with it, which make it all the more pleasant for the viewer as well. Especially George Clooney and Brad Pitt remain great in this movie. Also the newly added Catherine Zeta-Jones does a great job. It still are foremost the actors and all of their chemistry together that make this still a good and enjoyable enough watch. Just imaging this movie without any of them and you would have a pretty bad and maybe even boring movie. Same goes for Steven Soderbergh directing approach.Besides all of the familiar names, all of the Ocean's movies also have a familiar style to them. They are all hip, stylish movies to watch, which also still really helps to make these movies better than the average ones within the genre.It's also good to see how they had really learned from their mistakes with this movie, since the third movie, of course named ""Ocean's Thirteen"", is a much better one again, that also is being more like the first movie with its story, fun and characters.They really tried too hard with this movie and truly overdid it this time but all in all this movie remains a good and enjoyable enough watch.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Ocean's Twelve is a perfect sequel.,"There I said it. It absolutely remembers and honours the details and relationships built in Eleven, respects then and builds on them, whilst also making something completely new. Off the bat Garcia solidifies himself as a hilariously droll comic actor; the sequences of him recruiting the team again shows not only his humour but also his imposing and powerful nature given how delicately he handles every encounter as if he knows how to get to them, he hasn't broken character from Eleven, he's still cool, he's the Twelfth member.
I don't have the time to explain why I love this European Crime Caper Con movie. Where 11 was a finely tuned machine of a movie, 12 had been designed to feel real, magical, but completely real. When Soderbergh does his one for the studio to make up for the (beautiful) bomb Solaris, he really still imbues it with his wit and verve and spirit and unique charm and skills. Another of it's greatest strengths is it's fourth wall bursting, winking script and cast. It's a film that knows itself, and entertains in a way that maybe no other film could ever do quite like this ever again.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Decent if viewed with the proper expectations,"This is a great movie, if one accepts the fact that it is more of a comedy and less a heist movie. It was MUCH less serious than Oceans Eleven and I think that was intentional. All in all I was not disappointed and think this movie is worth viewing. The plot of this movie I though was light hearted and a little tricky. Nothing too heavy. I think you could almost call this a tastefull spoof of Oceans Eleven only with the same cast, spoofing themselves. Acting was decent, locations were great, and the new additions to the cast I thought were OK. I am not really sure why so many people bashed this movie. It is entertaining. Sometimes people need to discard their snobbish tendencies and just allow themselves to be entertained.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
An Empty Shell Game with the viewing audience as the mark.,"I usually try to keep silent about movies I really disliked, but this one goes too far, and seems to be getting off the hook with both the public and reviewers. The two main problems this film had were: 1. The plot, tension, action, and every other feature possible were vastly inferior to the Oceans 11 remake from two years ago. That movie was also on the light and fluffy side of things, but at least it had some real thriller elements and some good solid action to fill out the plot holes. This film has almost no action, no tension (this is not a thriller), and the characters are obviously all just rich actors sitting around BSing (reading their script), admittedly having a great time doing so, but...Which leads into point #2: this is a very boring film. This is why I have never written a review like this. Every time someone else reviews a film I liked, and calls it boring, I feel that the review is unfair and should not have been written by that person since they obviously don't like the particular genre. The problem is I love flawed but interesting action thrillers like Ocean 11 (both original and the remake). O-12 had far too much dialog from these gleeful stars. The so called brilliance of the two ringleaders George Clooney and Brad Pitt was so trite and unbelievable. The things they could find out about totally unknown identities of other crime figures were ridiculous. None of the lead roles demonstrated the least bit of superior intelligence in anything they said or did, except possibly Katherine Z-J, but she wasn't a criminal, so what is the point?Finally, the Julia Roberts thing was a travesty. I just hated it. It wasn't funny. It was only an empty shell game, and the only mark was the entire theatre audience for wasting $6 or $8 on such an empty movie. This whole film was like a loose, very weak imitation of The Spanish Prisoner. Since all the crooks had no brains, it was totally unbelievable and boring.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great Movie,"I was such a fan of the first movie that I had to rush out and see this the first day it came out. Now, I understand the first movie was better, but this one is not that far off either. The first time I saw Oceans 12 I left the movies confused. After buying the DVD and listening and understanding the movie, I have absolutely enjoyed it to the fullest. With actors such as Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia, and Matt Damon, How can the movie be bad. The story is much more hidden than in the first one, but it makes it all the more interesting as you have to follow each character in their own way. The stunts in the movie are great and the music is absolutely fantastic, especially towards the end in the laser scene. Oceans 11 was a 10. No doubt about it. This movie, is not that far off, thus my score will be a 9. For all of you who don't believe me, see it yourself, and don't listen to people who say the movie was terrible. It was the furthest thing from terrible.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Better to stick with the heist topic,"I'd say Ocean's Twelve is a decent film in my opinion. But here's one major issue I noticed.I feel like the reason why this movie didn't do as well as Ocean's Eleven was because the story focused so much on the romance between Rusty and Isabel.

The only important character was Zeta Jones. It was stupid, silly, and totally aloof, blasé, and superficial. It was a waste of time.

Reunion not as much fun,"Daniel Ocean (George Clooney) is still itching for the life. Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) tracks down Tess (Julia Roberts) and he wants his money back plus an exorbitant interest even though he already got it back from the insurance company. Benedict starts to track down the Ocean's Eleven crew. The crew gets back together to pull off jobs so that they could pay back Benedict. However this time they are being hounded by a brilliant investigator Isabel Lahiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones).It takes too long to set up. It would be much more thrilling to have Benedict just kidnap everybody. The setup is a little thin. If Carl Reiner wanted a small role, they could easily have his character in a hood as a kidnap victim for the entire movie. The chances are better that some if not most would just run in this story. Then of course, there wouldn't be a movie. It just rambles on and on without the excitement or fun of the original. At least, nobody said no to George or Soderbergh . The star power is the main reason to catch this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Spend your money on food for your kids,"Ocean's Twelve was a waste of my time and money ($20). It was perhaps the worst movie plot I've seen in two years. Horrible! Unbelievable! The only saving grace for this film were the actors and actresses. Beautiful people in beautiful clothes and beautiful locations. If you have money, I guess you can spend it unwisely! Take my advice. Go see a different movie. This one stinks! The jet-lag from traveling to Europe should have been a part of the plot. Instead the time frame of the movie does not relate to real-world time. Catherine Zeta-Jones is, as usual, very beautiful! She played her part as best as she could until the very end. Then the plot really gets twisted. The flash-backs are distracting and unnecessary. The role Andy Garcia plays as Terry Benedict (the casino owner) doesn't use enough muscle and his role is stupid. The movie should have been renamed, ""Greed of the Rich!""

Roll the Dice........Boxcars.,"Fun caper flick that has that 1960s/1970s Euro-trash style to it as the titled characters (led by George Clooney, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt and the rest) are forced to pay back the villain from ""Ocean's 11"" (Andy Garcia) after he and his associates track down our heroes. Now Clooney and the gang must make $190 million over a two week period as they travel to Amsterdam and Rome to pull their heists. Along for the ride is a sexy detective (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who has a past with Pitt and a world-class criminal (Vincent Cassel) who wants to prove to the underworld that he indeed is the greatest international thief. Totally silly and over-exaggerated, but enjoyable nevertheless. Director Steven Soderbergh uses a proved formula and a top-notch cast to get his wild points across. Cameos abound from big name stars and alums from the original give the picture a cool ""Where's Waldo?"" feel to it. Far from a special picture, but still a legitimate production. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Crime
Not really the new Eleven...,"This is one of those cases where the law of diminishing returns unfortunately applies.Three years after the Bellagio heist in Vegas, Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his mates are tracked down by Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), who wants his money back. With interest. In two weeks. Or he'll kill every last one of them. Therefore the team decides to move to Europe, so that they can steal some valuable stuff. They only have two problems: one is Isabel Lahiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones), an Interpol agent on their trail, who also happens to be Rusty's (Brad Pitt) former girlfriend; the other one is a French con-man (Vincent Cassel) who seems to be ahead of them all the time.Original crime caper Ocean's Eleven is a very good film, mainly because of the script. The same can't be said about this sequel: the screenplay was originally written for a John Woo flick, and sadly, people can notice that: it's SO obvious the plot was altered just to let Clooney and the others go fooling around in France and Italy. Also, why call the movie Ocean's Twelve and make Rusty the team-leader? OK, so this time HIS love interest is causing trouble, but why didn't the writer just name the film Ryan's Twelve in that case?Anyway, Twelve still has some appeal, thanks to one of its predecessor's key elements: great actors. Despite the discontinuous script, all the cast-members obviously enjoyed shooting this film, and I enjoyed watching their work. Matt Damon, in particular, steals the show as the insecure Linus, who would like ""a more central role this time"". The new entries (Zeta-Jones, Cassel) are quite good too, but the real treat is Bruce Willis'uncredited cameo as himself: Albert Finney, Robbie Coltrane and Eddie Izzard's brief appearances impress as well, but Bruno's presence is, along with Clooney asking people ""How old do you think I am?"", the funniest, and probably best sequence in the entire film. You might not like all of it, but that scene really is worth watching.Altogether, a bit disappointing but still enjoyable.

Your opinion depends on your expectations,"""If you loved the first movie because it developed into a brilliantly masterminded theft with many twists, you be left with the empty feeling that the only thing that was lifted in this movie; was your money for the admission ticket."" said Jason in another comment.I think it is brilliantly summed up.Actually, I saw this movie twice.

This movie is totally different from the first. It is not at all a ""mission : impossible - like"" but rather a good robbers comedy. It is a very intelligent story, with twists of another type, much more comic. The acting is generally good, especially Matt Damon. The only real criticism I would give (and a big one) is for the filming.

Quite good but definitely some flaws,"I thought the movie was good, but the whole plot surrounding it I really didn't understand. Why do they care so much about Benedict? They must have known he would threaten them and if they knew that then if they were going to give in to the threats and give the money back why did they rob him in the first place? And thinking about it they didn't even steal anything in the movie, they just cheated and asked the other thief here it was. The Nightfox was actually better than them. But the characters are great, especially Brad Pitt who i actually went to see the movie for. He is just so HOT in that film, and the one before it. It was a bit too complicated though because they did stuff and i didn't know why and when and how. But you know, Brad Pitt kinda makes up for it. I still think he shouldn't have cut his hair so short though and kept it like it was in the first movie. I really don't understand who Linus's dad is though.

"""Twelve"" A Little Less Than ""Eleven""","At the beginning of ""Ocean's Twelve,"" casino owner Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) tracks down the eleven men who stole from him in the previous film. He threatens retribution if they do not pay him back with interest. With George Clooney's cool Danny Ocean at the crew's helm yet again, the ensemble sets off to Europe to earn back Benedict's money with a new series of heists.Once they cross the Atlantic, however, the story gets more complicated. Rusty (Brad Pitt) has an old flame in Amsterdam, a detective tasked with tracking down thieves. To further convolute matters, another criminal starts challenging Ocean in Europe, hitting the same heists as the team with a competitive ultimatum that spices the plot.""Ocean's Twelve"" has the same core cast as ""Ocean's Eleven,"" but uses its actors differently. Sadly, we don't spend as much time with each character as we do in the first film. Even Ocean seems to take the backseat to Rusty for much of this story. On the contrary, Matt Damon's character gets nudged to the foreground. Fresh off his second action-packed outing as Jason Bourne, the actor has a much-appreciated enhanced role.Meanwhile, Julia Roberts also returns with more screen time as Tess Ocean. While Tess felt like a somewhat gratuitous romantic interest in the first film, she carries more weight this time around, becoming the twelfth member of the titular team. In fact, Roberts even delivers the movie's best performance during a daring scene where the diegetic Tess has to impersonate the actual Julia Roberts after their physical similarities are pointed out. It is a cerebral experiment that few actors could fathom, but Roberts pulls it off quite well. Bruce Willis also portrays himself in this hilarious sequence.From that scene alone, it's apparent that ""Ocean's Twelve"" is far a stranger film than ""Ocean's Eleven."" The first movie was a pretty straightforward addition to the heist-crime genre, but ""Twelve"" is more of an indie flick. It does not center on a particular job for Ocean's team, but instead tracks them through a labyrinth of unexpected variables in the criminal profession.Director Steven Soderbergh also gets more stylistic here. Quirky transitions, freeze frames, and unconventional camerawork keep ""Ocean's Twelve"" engaging for those interested in artistic cinema. For viewers who might prefer a more conservative crime movie, though, these aesthetic liberties can be distracting.It also doesn't help that ""Twelve's"" cinematography feels a step down from ""Eleven's."" Perhaps it is the lack of the glitzy Las Vegas backdrop, but ""Twelve"" looks grainer, at times even documentary-like. Soderbergh shot both films himself, so the difference is yet another extension of his artistic preference.The movie is surely ambitious, but while ""Ocean's Eleven"" strikes a great balance between humor, style, and substance, ""Twelve"" leans a little further towards the first two at the third's expense.It's a fun film and a worthy sequel, but nevertheless lands just a notch beneath the first installment.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Well I liked it !,"The Oceans saga following the exploits of Danny Ocean and the gang is something you will either like love or hate. Yes of course, you have this over hyped nonsense about sooo many stars being in it and it cost this much to make and the hype is spread all over the place. The first movie kept me entertained long enough with its wise cracks and build up to its master heist but to be honest I really did not think it was all that so naturally I was having my doubts about watching Oceans 12 although whilst reading other reviews I was rather surprised to see how much some people really disliked it. So I was taking quite a gamble on watching it but to be honest with it was not all that bad!!! Yes of course it had problems but my advice is just to watch for the sake of entertainment and for the sake of entertainment only and not get to nit-picky over every small little detail. Set 3 years after the events of the first movie we find our band of thieves in hot water again as Terry Benedict has mad as hell and wants to be paid with interest for his loss. So our group reassembles once again to pay Terry and keep their lives this time headed of to Europe , of course things take a turn for the worst as there is a twist involved which does not help them at all with time running out! The layout of the film was great , fans of the BBC show Hustle will understand what I am saying and with funny jokes running all the way through ( I love part where the Chinese acrobat talks in Chinese and the gang say it in English). Geroge Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and Bernie Mac not to mention Don Cheadle (aside from his crappy English accent) all done great. But this also Matt Damon, Catherine Zeta-Jones (never really took the time to see how sexy she was) and Vincent Cassel (the laser room) rocked. There was also a certain special someone who turns up and kind off adds a surreal feeling to the film which may not sit well with everyone but I thought it was cool. There are problems visible like the movie sets out on a target but never really seems to accomplish it as it gets torn away into a sub-plot ties into the main plot, the Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones love thing was good but just ends out being a little too cheesy and nothing we can connect with on a deep level and there were elements that made it look a little to dame easy. But however to conclude not everybody would agree with this review but if you searching for a good night in with some good food and a glass of wine then pop this into your DVD player, just watch just for the sake of entertainment.OCEANS 12 - 8.8 OUT OF 10TWELVE IS THE NEW ELEVEN!",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

A Hollywood Money Maker,"I like this film to a certain extent. A good storyline (however predictable), good acting and nice settings. However, this film was always going to be another way for Hollywood to make money, as is the same with Italian Job. It had nice plot twists through the story to keep you guessing but lacked the depth in the script. I don't know whether I liked the scene with Bruce Willis or not, was it too unrealistic and corny, maybe. For me it didn't quite have the same rhythm as Oceans Eleven where the story was fresh. The movie seemed to have been done because the actors wanted it to happen, even though their wasn't a good enough plot to entertain the viewer. The film seemed to have focused a lot on the same three characters throughout the movie, Clooney, Damon and Pitt. I didn't see much of Garcia, Roberts, Cheadle or Bernie Mac who are very entertaining actors who if were in involved more could of spiced the movie up. I liked this movie but I know it wouldn't be everyones taste, I probably liked it as much as I did because of the great cast involved.

is this what passes for acting these days?,"OK..Ocean's 11, the original, was not citizen Kane, but at least it had charm and the natural ability of the rat pack could not be totally contained regardless of the weakness of the endeavor. This movie, perhaps as much as any, vividly shows why Turner Classic Movies has such good ratings, and why so few of today's actors and actresses come even close to measuring up to their predecessors. Evidently someone has come up to the conclusion that if a few good looking, well primped up people are gathered together, and place them in the ultimate cool setting of Las Vegas Boulevard, they would somehow radiate and attract the audience's undivided attention.

"Classic film, great cast, excellent, hilarious sequel","For those of you that loved the first one, you will greatly enjoy this film.The cast alone should be enough for you to want to see this film. The screenplay is well written and keeps the characters true. The movie primarily takes place in Italy and revolves around the cast trying to payback Benedict what they stole from him plus interest. At the beginning we catch up with the 11 thieves. Linus is as neurotic as before. Frank has his own nail salon. Danny and Tess are trying to settle into a normal life.Rusty is still in the stealing business, only now he has a girlfriend who is a detective for Europool. Although, he doesn't eat as much food.

crazy camera-work,"I thought this movie was fine, if fun and eye-candy are what you had in mind. I much prefer the first - Ocean's Eleven - with it's great plot, great characters, and slick camera-work. This one brings together the characters, but doesn't delve into them as the first one did. It has an okay plot, and if you're just in it for the entertainment value, it is fine. And of course, the actors and actresses in it are beautiful. But my largest complaint in this is the camera-work. Most of the film looks like it was filmed using a regular camcorder, not a steady-cam. This type of filming is usually reserved for documentaries or 'Cops'. I thought it was only going to be used a short amount, in the beginning when they were reintroducing the characters. However, that was not the case, and it actually gave me a headache. In summary, fine movie for fun, but doesn't hold up to the original.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"It's different, not bad.","Alright, here is the inside scoop. Clearly Oceans Eleven is a better movie. The first movie was great because the characters had style and class. Everyone moved around with a certain confidence and a purpose. There was a plan from the get go and the audience was hooked. The sequel was just different. Ocean's Twelve was a separate movie, not to be compared to Ocean's Eleven. I agree that the plot was a little hard to follow sometimes, but after the first movie, we were all expecting to not know how this movie would end. Despite being lost from time to time, I was thoroughly entertained...especially with Julia Roberts' part in the story. The plot twists were so ridiculous that there was no way to predict them. At least in the first, an intelligent movie watcher could see the twists as something they should have noticed from earlier in the film (air freshener). In the second one, the audience was just too lost to even notice when there was a twist in the plot. The sequel did not have the same elegance as the first, but it was not too shabby. Matt Damon surprised me by having more to do in this sequel, and he did a much better job. The dialog was not as witty as a revived rat pack crew from Ocean's Eleven, but the sequel still had some good qualities. With an ending that leaves me a little unsettled, I still came out of that movie entertained. At the same time, I was thinking to myself... ""I know lots of people that won't like this movie."" Just go into it with an open mind, and try not to hold it up to the same standards as the first.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Fun for the moment,"So i finally decided to see ""Ocean's Twelve"". And i must say that it was above expectation. I feel the movie has been rather unfairly treated in the media, at least here in Sweden. But then again i never considered ""Ocean's Eleven"" to be a masterpiece either so perhaps it has mostly to do with expectation.""Ocean's Eleven"" was an entertaining movie no doubt. But the whole almost legendary status that it's gotten is pretty much beyond me. Sure it had loads of good actors, a fun sense of humor and was pretty nice all around. It was good entertainment for the moment, and in that respect it was among the best of it's genre. But a masterpiece? Not really.Perhaps this is also why i can accept ""Ocean's Twelve"" more easily than many other people. The actors are still there, the style of the movie is pretty much the same and the comedy is also same brand as in the first movie. What is somewhat lacking here might be good ideas. It seems like in the first movie they knew exactly what kind of movie they wanted to make, they had a decent idea that (while being very far from original) worked. Also they had a plan when it came to using all the obvious talent in the cast to best effect. Here that plan seems to be missing. Also the movie has a problem with pacing, the first half is rather slow and it's not until the second half that the pace is picked up properly.Heist-movies pretty much follow a very strict formula and the ""Ocean's""-movies are no different. Cool people stealing things in a ridiculously complicated way. Added to all the famous names from the first movie is also french actor Vincent Cassel who is always a colorful addition to any movie he stars in. Despite his french antagonist, and despite the obvious attempts to leave the heist-formula a little bit, this movies greatest problem is still that we've seen it all done before.In short this is not a movie to remember, but i found it decent entertainment while it lasted. ""Ocean's Eleven"" is a better movie, but not by as much as people seem to think. I rate this 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Matt Damon in this movie has a role much important than it's prequel. Exotic locations, casinos, wealthy and artistic homes, all this movie shows will make you dream of being a thief.

Downright ridiculous. But fun...,"I am in no way comparing 12 to 11. Because... well... there *is* no comparison. Which is really quite sad because Ocean's 11 was one of those rare cinematic treats that refused to condescend to the cinema-goer by treating them with respect and commanding their intelligence. It was fun. It was chic. It was sexy as hell. And we had every right to expect that same sort of experience with the much anticipated sequel.Unfortunately, Sonderbergh's sequel doesn't match up to all the eager expectations.However, I *am* going to say, that I *will* give Ocean's 12 credit for simply being what it is: two hours of a shamelessly whimsical ride. Yes, the plot is ridiculous (though not as confusing as some here have claimed) and the film does indeed hang itself by its' own rope. BUT, if you clear your memory of that wonderful first movie, then I think it is still possible to enjoy this film as a cheeky romp that actually *doesn't* take itself seriously (as some here have claimed) and doesn't make any attempts to dig deeper than its admittedly shallow and glossy surface of quick-witted one-liners and slapstick pranks.Ocean's 12 is a ride that unfortunately, judging by the sprinkled laughter in the theater when I saw the film, much of the audience isn't going to catch on to. But if you *do* catch the ride, well, it *does* make for a pretty damn fun time. (If for no other reason than getting to hear Matt Damon use the opening lines of Led Zepplin's 'Kashmir' in an effort to 'speak code' which I thought was downright hilarious. Of course the kid sitting next to me at the theater had *no* clue what was going on...)",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

There's the small Chinese kid - Yen (Shaobo Qin) - who can squeeze into tight spaces, and speaks only his native language, but appears to be understood by his companions. Scott Caan grins a great deal and has a way too short haircut. And it goes on, and on and on.

Enjoyable but a complete mess.,"Ocean's Twelve (2004, Dir. Steven Soderbergh)They pulled off one of the biggest heists ever and now they have another job to complete. Ocean's Eleven, which consisted off Danny Ocean, Rusty Ryan and Linus Caldwell and others, all thought they would be able to enjoy their money, but someone has other plans. Terry Benedict is still fuming after losing his money and wants it back. The team now have the job of getting all the money they spent back, or risk being thrown in jail. How are they going to get it all back? By pulling off another amazing plan.The first film of the trilogy was very enjoyable and i looked forward to the idea of a sequel. Unfortunately, the sequel has many problems. All the characters are back and are great as usual, and although the jokes do seem to lack in amount since the first film, they are still fun to hear. The big problem the movie has is storytelling. I don't know what they could read on paper, but what i saw on film, i just could not understand what was happening.

We get more brains and dialogue from the rest of the thief crew. Film is primarily set in Europe and there are a few Bond-esque overly dramatic music scenes. I liked them haha.

Disjointed confusing plot and photography,"Clooney and cohorts are back with a predictable script--the owner of the Bellagio, the victim in the first movie, wants his money back even though he has already been paid by his insurance company (defamation lawsuit anybody) and through some convoluted plot sequence it is determined that Clooney has 2 weeks or is it a month, or is it Monday afternoon, to do something. On-screen notes give time lines, but it is never certain what the time lines are for--either getting the money back, or the second heist, or the date the Bellagio owner is going to do away with Clooney. The ending makes no sense so I can't spoil it because I never really got it. However, it should be noted that Albert Finney as the real mastermind thief and Bruce Willis as himself are both uncredited--probably at their own request. Although Julia Roberts plays the role of Ocean's wife Tess, she also is uncredited--the credits actually state, ""and introducing Tess as Julia Roberts."" Julia's probably hoping people will think it wasn't her, especially since she wore no makeup (evidently to make her role as a housewife more believable.)

"Overall a wholesome, relaxed entertainer, just sit back, and enjoy!","Everyone 'thinks' before the movie starts that well, we'll crack the heist before Steven shows it on screen. So, you rattle your brain, try add everything around and start jumping to your own conclusions. The show I went for had a 15 minute break to accommodate a presentation of sorts, where most people were outside sipping cola. And everyone was coming up with their own predictions 'Oh, Lahiri is the twelfth. Terry Benedict is helping as the twelfth'.The fact of the matter is, whether you are an Ocean's 11/ 12 hater or lover, the developments leave you a little surprised, if not confused. I'd say just keep the basics of Ocean's 11 in mind, but do not compare the two. The heist this time is more complicated, and they do not have as much time to plan or even think. They're on the run from the start. Obviously, end of the day you expect and get the group to pull of the heist, but credit must be given to the writers and director for keeping everyone in suspense, which at times frustrates also. Like, you want Julia Roberts to pull off the thing; (btw, her sequence sounds ridiculous, but when you see it, it's very neatly done!) you want the group to not be arrested, you want Zeta-Jones to be a thief; you want Danny and Rusty to be in control of the situation like in the first part- and all of this does not happen! Though, it's revealed in the end how they were 2 steps ahead of the brilliant Vincent Cassel.Must admit was disappointed with the usage of some characters- thought that Bernie Mac, Andy Garcia and Elliot Gould could have been given more footage. At times it looks like they could not accommodate roles for everyone and have compromised a lot. I generally do not like him, but loved Matt Damon as the 'wannabe' kid! Very funny. Seasoned performers like Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Julia Roberts sail through their roles very efficiently. Catherine Zeta-Jones is adequate, and looks good. The director in Steven Soderbergh scores, but the efficient story teller is missing. Very slick, most of the scenes look classy.The film is very easy on the eyes, and like some people have been pointing out, looks like the cast had a lot of fun doing it. In fact, the last shot when the party is on, it looks like it was a real party, and there were cameras rolling.Do not be fooled by the negative publicity generated by certain sections of the media.

Dull and disappointing.,"Heist movies should be fun and entertaining  not dull and glib. But that's precisely what ""Ocean's Twelve"" is  a smug, slow exercise in Hollywood banality. You can feel the sweaty palms of fattened executives draining the zest and energy out of this picture. Granted, the first movie wasn't anything great, but it was unassuming and amiable  a bunch of celebrities got together, had a good time, and made a movie that invited the viewer along for the ride. It worked as a slice of distracting summer cinema.But ""Ocean's Twelve"" suffers from that complex that a lot of sequels get  you know, the first flick is an unexpected success, and then the studios push for a sequel and completely dominate the production now knowing they have a bona fide lucrative franchise on their hands.In this case it feels as if the studio execs weren't the only ones to blame. The cast is obnoxiously self-aware  in the first film Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) walked the line between ""cool"" and ""fool"" and in ""Ocean's Twelve"" he comes across as an utterly annoying, wannabe hipster. I don't think Brad Pitt is necessarily to blame, although his delivery of lines doesn't help much. They sound forced and overtly dramatic. It just isn't real enough, even for escapism.Some of the actors seem to disappear for large amounts of time  Andy Garcia and Bernie Mac must have been called away for another shoot, because they mostly vanish after the first fifteen minutes. In fact, the first fifteen minutes of the film really just exists to give Garcia a role in the movie  except for a brief appearance at the end, it's the only screen time he really gathers.The new additions seem tacky and unnecessary  likewise the cameos are contrived, and the self-referential Julia Roberts-playing-Tess-playing-Julia-Roberts scene must have looked a lot better on paper.Soderbergh's direction is harder and laced with grit  the hand-cam shots and filtered bleak cinematography really give the film an abysmal edge that hinders it. The original was vibrant, colorful and alive  ""Twelve"" is dead from the start.Not a terrible motion picture by any standard, but then again I'd hardly feel compelled to label this ""entertainment."" It's a sporadically amusing, mostly grueling sequel that never really rings true  it's like an exclusive in-joke for the cast and crew, and the audience's involvement was obviously of secondary importance during filming.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

I just love Steven Soderbergh films, despite the fact I've only seen three of his movies. Those three movies are ERIN BROCKOVICH, OCEAN'S ELEVEN, and this one. Also, I especially loved the costumes. They were really well designed in my opinion. When Tess (Julia Roberts) asked Danny (George Clooney) if he was doing recon work on their anniversary, I laughed.

Worth staying alive for!!!!!!!,"To be brutally frank neither I nor my mother have yet seen this film BUT WE SO WANT TO!!!!!

She isn't very well now, as a matter of fact, and is confined to her bedroom (actually, she's confined to her bed, but that's another story) but her eyes lit up and I could tell she was keen when the teasers for this started appearing. We won't be able to get to the cinema (well, she won't, anyway) but let's hope it turns up on DVD pretty soon, or VHS. It's a shame sometimes that films like this can't go straight to video to help out the housebound and bedridden. Still, there's that nice Mr Chan in the local market who often has these things on DVD even before they're released in the cinema over here and he might be able to help me out.

They're all so great, I really feel like they're my friends. I'd love to invite them round. The only fly in the ointment (that actually happened to us recently, btw, as the weather has been a bit up and down) is that Vincent Cassell is in it.

"Self indulgent, weak script, waste of space",I went expecting a tight fast paced and purposeful film. Instead we saw a group of very highly paid actors dream through a rotten script. From the start the script did not hand together. They had to try to pretend there was a plot. But it had so many holes there was no substance. It had no meaning no raison d'etre. It was a clear case of cashing in on the first film which did have a point and was well scripted and well acted.I could go on about the specific details to show how weak the whole thing was. They had desperately to seek cameo performances from other actors to shore up a sinking story and in fact that made it even worse. Avoid at all costs. Do not go to see. Actors like and here is a long list that I thought well are demeaned by being in this film. Why did they agree to take part?

This film is much closer to ""Ronin"" or ""The Sting"" than either ""Ocean's Eleven"" or ""Topkapi""There's a specific comedic plot point that people thought was stupid and/or over the top. but that's the beauty of what Soderburgh was trying to do here - a wink to the audience to say,""Hey, THIS IS A MOVIE."" Modern American tastes have been so conditioned to the hyper-realistic that the self-reflexive nature of this film will be lost on many.Quite simply, this is an art-house intellectual comedy with the gloss and A-List stars of Hollywood. It's a completely DIFFERENT movie in every respect from Ocean's Eleven, which makes it work. Definitely worth seeing twice, if only to catch the little details.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Joyless Job,"When a film viewer is asked to slog through dense or convoluted dialogue, there needs to be a pay-off. Likewise for editing that challenges the viewer.An example of this is the film ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"". It is challenging to watch, but there is a pay-off at every turn---with humor or insight or both. ""Ocean's Twelve"", on the other hand, offers no rewards for perseverance, except more obfuscation and dullness.Moments in the film that might elicit a laugh or a pleasurable revelation are undermined by the editing and the plot, and rendered ineffective. It's a shame, considering all the talent involved.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
Inspired silliness and the best looking movie you'll see all year,"This may be number two in what is another franchise but Steven Soderbergh's love of movies and the movie-making process is evident in every fabulous looking frame, (this is probably the best-looking movie you'll see all year), and if the extremely daft plot, (there are daft heist movies and then there is ""Ocean's 12""), could be scribbled on the back of a postage stamp this is also the most sheerly enjoyable film I have seen in a very long time.As for that daft plot, it exists only as an excuse to do a follow-up to the hugely successful ""Ocean's 11"". It's complicated, at times it's basically non-existent and this movie, more than the last one, often feels like a bunch of pals goofing around in front of the camera; (remember the very first ""Ocean's 11"" with the Rat Pack? Well, that's what killed it). The difference here is that everyone on screen is having a ball and it's infectious and Soderbergh is a master stylist and a great innovator who loves playing fast and loose with plot mechanics. None of it may make the slightest bit of sense yet there is not a redundant moment in the whole movie. Clooney, Damon, Pitt, Reiner and Gould are all marvellous; Julia Roberts has one great scene in which her character Tess passes herself off as ... Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones works wonders the the film's only misbegotten character, Pitt's love interest who happens to be the female detective on everybody's tail. It may be inspired silliness but I loved it to bits and can't wait to see ""Ocean's 13"".",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Deus ex machina: the movie,"Can ""Ocean's Twelve"" even really be called a heist movie? It's predecessor was tight, coherent and it trimmed most of the fat. This movie is basically all fat. Clearly the ensemble cast had a great time making it, but that doesn't translate to the screen at all.The best thing about ""Ocean's Eleven"" is that behind all the glitter, it's a simple and well-crafted plot. Criminals try to rob a casino, the owner tries to prevent it. That's basically all you need. This movie is incredibly jumbled, with a bloated plot that just goes from one illogical, laboured twist to the other. There's nothing inventive about these twists. Our heroes basically do almost nothing and succeed through dumb luck. You're not supposed to film the first draft, but it seems like that's exactly what they did.There's a lot happening in this movie, but at the same time the pace is very sluggish. In the second half we have a long (and I do mean long) sequence where Tess, played by Julia Roberts, pretends she's Julia Roberts. It's a fun idea, but it goes on forever and has very little bearing on the plot. Hell, the first act in Amsterdam is mostly time-wasting as well. This movie barely has a structure, you could mix the scenes randomly and it wouldn't much difference. What a far cry from the first one.""Ocean's Twelve"" also introduces the characters of the Night Fox and LaMarque. While the Night Fox certainly is a fun character (Vincent Cassel in a stellar role), both characters feel very much like a deus ex machina. They can be anywhere, at any time, doing just about anything. Obviously we barely see their heists, we just have to assume they use almost superhuman talents. Why write something clever if you can just have two 'master thieves' resolve every plot thread? For entertainment? That ship has sailed.P. S: Screw this movie for hiring screen legend Jeroen Krabbé and giving him... zero lines. Hell, just use an extra.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Ocean's Twelve was absolutely brilliant, but you need to be pretty mature and have at least some measure of class to enjoy it.","That pretty much explains all the bad reviews it gets: these are all written by 14 year olds who sit in their basements all day long online. This movie is a classic, and though it could be argued that it doesn't match up to Ocean's Eleven, you could retort just as easily that Ocean's Eleven is decades-old classic and Ocean's Twelve was written recently.This film is clean: no gore, cussing, sexuality/nudity, or drug use. It does have plenty of characters though, and these serve to spice the plot up all the way to the end.The plot is brilliant, and everything that happens, does so for a reason. Those who complain about plot holes need to realize that J.R.R. Tolkien, the greatest author of the 20th century, did not write without plot holes. I find it strange that these people will criticize a storyline that they could never write the equal of AND the acting that they could never pull off, while still complaining that the movie was too slow-paced and was boring. Perhaps they'd prefer the Star Wars prequels. Oh wait, they complained about those as well, for just the opposite! It appears that there is no pleasing them! With that in mind, ignore the critics, and recognize a masterpiece when you see it.The subtle humor and classic characters in this are just brilliant. Daniel Ocean and ""Rusty"" Ryan, played by George Clooney and Brad Pitt, both good-looking and talented actors, are just complete geniuses. The conversations they have maintain the hilarity of the the predecessor film, and they are just a joy to watch. Also with new characters such as a detective played by Catherine Zeta-Jones and a mysterious rival thief known as the Nightfox, this movie is every bit as brilliant as the first.Indulge yourself. Watch this movie in theaters, making sure to have plenty of delicious popcorn and refreshing Coca-Cola, and then rent it once it comes out, and then by the DVD for good measure.

All the various stories work beautifully, the love story, the heist, the deception. An almost perfect blend of plot and tone. Great writing with a wink. Most sequels are a disaster.

Brilliant reinvention of a theme,"Instead of repeating himself, Soderbergh has taken the unconventional (and very un- Hollywood) route of making a film in which doesn't insult the intelligence and need to spoon- feed the audience.It's obvious the cast had enjoyed making this film, but the film shows the director and screenwriters had the most fun in creating a combination of heist/James Bond/French New Wave non-linear film that breaks every rule it can.The plot is cryptic, the feasibility ludicrous, the situations outlandish - but that's the whole point.

Awesome,"Soderbergh delivers again. The movie was really smart and fast paced. It's almost a completely different kind of movie from the first, which isn't a bad thing at all. It took the same great cast of characters we all knew and made another really interesting film. It's hard to compare it to its predecessor, but is ultimately a great movie. It seemed to focus on some characters more than others, but still maintained a balance for the crew of twelve. It had Great Bits, Great Cameos, a lot of situational mishaps, and loads fun in my opinion. I doubt it will be as well received as the first, but I think it stands up well.

The Moose Hole - Review of Ocean's Twelve,"After grossing nearly one-hundred and eighty-five million dollars domestically and well over four-hundred and fifty million dollars world-wide, Warner Brother executives were eager to jump on the bandwagon while the property was still hot and pump out a sequel as quickly, and cheaply, as possible. Steven Soderbergh insisted that the production budget be kept around the same as that of the original film  eight-five million dollars respectively  and asked all his actors, specifically George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Julia Roberts, to take significant pay cuts from their usual twenty-million dollar-per-picture salary. And with the WB studio in a tight market race, currently tied for second place with The Walt Disney Company, they need a hit more then ever, especially if they want to come close to recovering profits lost on the multi-million dollar disaster, Alexander. Perhaps the executives of the studio could learn a thing or two from these con-artists.The story picks up some time after the original film ended and takes audiences across such glamorous European locations as Amsterdam, Paris and Rome in another crime-capping adventure. It has been three years since Danny Ocean and the rest of the gang of thieves and con artists broke into the 'impenetrable' vault of Terry Benedict's Las Vegas casino and ripped a cool one-hundred and sixty million dollars right under his nose. After splitting the money amongst the eleven members of the Ocean's team, each went their separate ways, with the exception for Danny and Tess of course, and attempted to lie low and live an easy going life with their newly acquired fortune. Unfortunately for them, a fellow con-artist with a grudge against the group breaks Rule Number One by ratting them out to Terry Benedict, thus causing the ruthless casino owner to pay a visit to each and every one of the team members demanding a return of his one-hundred and ninety-eight million dollars  that's the amount of money they stole plus interest over three years  within two weeks. Considering they are too hot to find suitable work in the United States after their last stunt, they travel to Europe to steal an antique item only to run into complications with their criminal rival, 'The Night Fox', who just happened to be the man who broke Rule Number One. On top of that, the gang has to deal with Isabel Lahiri, an intrepid female Europol agent with extensive links with Rusty Ryan, who is vividly determined to catch them in the act. When it comes to the story treatment for Ocean's Twelve, one must learn not to take these sorts of genres, specifically the caper-comedy, seriously. They are for mere entertainment purposes only and not to be destined, or taken as such, for Oscar-caliber quality or serious thought. On another note, the script is not as original as it may seem. In fact, it was originally designed as John Woo action-flick vehicle but when it came to developing the highly-anticipated sequel to Ocean's Eleven, Warner Brothers decided to rewrite the script to specifically fit with each of the characters of the series. Though some may feel cheated by this piece of trivia, this turns out ten times better then anything John Woo could have slapped together, so look on the bright side of things here.The complication Ocean's Twelve faces, the exact same predicament the original feature ran into three years ago, is that with so many cast members, specifically ones with marquee names, increases the likelihood of each person receiving limited screen time which inevitably causes complaints of certain characters being underused. Quite surprisingly, the whole Brad Pitt/Catherine Zeta-Jones romance angle worked amazingly well and added yet another intriguing twist to the already complicated storyline. Unfortunately, what does not work out quite as well as it should have was the 'family' element to Catherine Zeta-Jones' Isabel Lahiri, if it can be properly described as such. There is hardly any mention of her family other then in limited moments of the film and the scene near the end where she reunites with her father seemed senselessly tacked onto the end without a second thought as to what it should have meant but was not. Perhaps it is due to all these separate story elements  the romance between Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones and the wager with 'The Night Fox'  that George Clooney's Danny Ocean seems quite left out of the picture compared to the last go-around where it was completely and entirely his film. Not that this was a significant problem but this is just yet another demonstration of the sometimes unequal shifting of story involvement amongst the numerous characters of the film series. Without giving too much information away, let us simply say that the way Tess is used in order to help the Ocean's gang pilfer a specific item from an Italian art museum was hilarious. Sure, it does wear a little thin as more time is spent on but, in the end, it works invariably. The only one that can truly be said as being underused in this picture is Andy Garcia reprising his role as the menacing Terry Benedict, the victim of Ocean's Eleven's casino heist from the first film. His appearance in the film, in the beginning and near the end, is really nothing more then a mere cameo, possibly to fulfill the contractual obligation he signed to appear in the sequel with the rest of the cast. This, on the other hand, can not be said of Matt Damon's Linus Caldwell who seems to have had a significant increase in the amount of screen time from the last film, playing a more central role in the story, specifically near the end.Overall, Ocean's Twelve, in spite of its failure to surpass the magnificence of the original which essentially set the precedent for all modern crime capers to follow, does indeed match it based on pure entertainment value and would certainly be a feature Frank Sinatra and the rest of the crooning Rat Pack would be proud of. All in all, the film itself has very few problems to raise complaint about  A drawback that was apparent with Ocean's Eleven as well was that the first thirty minutes of the picture start off quite laboriously and nothing exactly interesting happens or no real action occurs. Granted, this is to set up the situation and the characters but considering this is a sequel and most audience members are aware of the original film, this should not have taken as long as it did. And was it absolutely necessary to bring back every single member of the original Ocean's Eleven cast for this film? Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, and Carl Reiner barely appear at all  you could count on both hands, possibly only one, the number of lines each one of them has in this feature  and should have been written out entirely based on what they contribute  nothing. Middling complaints aside, Steven Soderbergh's skillful editing, mixing and cinematography style works wonders, except for the occasional still-picture shots, near the beginning and the end of the film, but are not so off-putting as to be entirely noticeable or discomforting. Though not holding quite the level of prestige as some notable sequels that have managed to surpass the expectations set upon by the first film might have, the series still able to maintain its suave composure, intricate white, and stylized flare to make more then worthwhile viewing over the holiday season this year.My Rating: **** out of 5 (Grade: B+)",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Just fun at the movies,"This film has been way over-hyped, but it's also being way over criticized. Everyone disappointed that it falls short of the first one. I think the storyline from the get go informs you that it will be nothing like the first film. Just as the first one was a well planned heist, you have individuals who have ""left the game"" for civilian living, and they're forced to play again. So as it stands those that complain that the film was not a true caper film, who said it had to be? It is not Ocean's 11. It's a film with the same characters that find themselves with completely different given circumstances. Soderberg's chosen style of this film differs drastically as well. It's dirtier, considerably more raw photographically, and I think that is great parallel with the characters realities. You have to remember that in Ocean's 11, it wasn't a goal to go after a specific amount of money.They focused on one job that offered a ridiculous amount of money...and now you've got characters that have little time and are forced to come up with a ridiculous amount of money. So they scramble, and they look for any way to come up with any amount of money they can. There was also a lot of ""inside"" jokes that weren't really inside for the cast, but for anyone who has travelled abroad and anyone that follows the entertainment industry.Admittedly, I went in with way too high of an expectation and still came out enjoying the film. It was not what I expected, but I laughed a lot harder than I did while viewing the first of the Ocean's. And I thought Brad Pitt opposite Catherine Zeta Jones was just as intriguing as George and Julia were in the first. You couldn't help but smile every time they graced the screen together. All in all, it was just a good time at the movies! And the chemistry between all the guys and girls involved was just electric.

Colorful homage to French  Nouvelle Vague,"Soderbergh made ""Ocean's Twelve"" with the same budget as ""Ocean's Eleven"", and in doing so has created something more than a typical Hollywood sequel. He has created a hilarious film that also acts as a sort of love letter to the French New Wave.Look at the jump cuts, the overlaid text, the meticulously designed plot, even the fact that it is filmed in Europe, and you can see the influence of Goddard and Melville. Even the twist is dripping with the New Wave. Soderbergh made a movie that screams out the fact that it IS a movie. It almost seems like, knowing that the movie would be judged against the greatness of the first film, decided to go all out, adding interesting techniques that aren't often seen in American movies, and even coming up with a new and inventive way to film an airplane.Though some complained about the convoluted plot, I found it easy enough to follow, and found the movie very funny.

Instead of working on pulling off one major job, the group of twelve is now sent from one job to another, and in the end, they all somehow end up as inconsequential. Why are they inconsequential? I can't really tell you. The movie lacks logic. My guess is the director just felt it wasn't quite complex enough, so he threw in another shocking twist. And Julia Roberts basically playing...

Soderbergh's slumming,"About 80 minutes into ""Ocean's Twelve,"" there's a rather clever joke involving Tess. If you pay attention, you'll realize it's set up much earlier in a quick conversation between two characters. Even though you know it's coming, the joke's pretty funny. And it's made funnier by the novel use of a cameo appearance. This is not just a cameo for cameo's sake, but actually using a person to play with the plot. A nice touch, it is.Unfortunately, that's about as interesting as director Steven Soderbergh's dull film gets. Reuniting the cast from the original remake, ""Ocean's Eleven"" (2001), this one finds Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his band of thieves running to Europe to pull of heists to pay off Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), the hotelier they ripped off in the first film.Trouble is if Terry didn't intimidate them the first time, why would they really get worried this time around? Ah, but that's thinking too much about this fluffy, airy film that simply tries to float on occasionally amusing riffs and star power. And why not? Consider the stars. Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Matt Damon, Elliott Gould, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Vincent Cassel.The last two are new this time. Zeta-Jones shows up as Isabel, a Euro cop and former lover of Pitt's character. And Cassel gets thrown in to the mix as French master burglar François Tourlour, who challenges Danny to a contest to see who the better thief is. Yes, that's actually a subplot in this film; one of a few superfluous subplots, including one about Isabel's father.One wonders why Isabel is in this movie at all. Talk about adding a character simply so it can be played by a movie star. Too bad, the star happens to be untalented. Sorry, pretty she might be. But Zeta-Jones quite possibly is the most over-rated actress working today. Sure, she may have won an Oscar for ""Chicago,"" but clearly any of the other nominees - Julianne Moore, Meryl Streep, Queen Latifah or Kathy Bates - actually deserved it that year.Zeta-Jones couldn't generate sparks with rocks if she rubbed them ceaselessly for hours. What passes for chemistry between Zeta-Jones and Pitt is laughable. She has one expression and she sticks to it.Since the story's set in Europe, Soderbergh apparently felt the need to give his film a European feel. In fact, the music and camera work gave me the impression Soderbergh was trying to emulate or, at least, pay homage to the films of the French New Wave.Problem is, Godard, Truffaut, Chabrol and others had no qualms about something bad happening to their protagonists. But ""Ocean's Twelve"" is pure Hollywood flash. And with this kind of star power, do you really wonder whether any of these characters would be sacrificed? With none of them under any real threat and the ending a foregone conclusion, all you're left is with actors trying to look and sound cool and charming. But George Nolfi's script - initially written for John Woo and then reworked for this sequel - thinks it's smart, when it isn't.Occasionally, the film wins a chuckle. But there's nothing genuinely exciting or even vaguely suspenseful about this story. In Soderbergh's breezy, but fun, ""Ocean's Eleven,"" the dialogue crackled, characters made us laugh and the story had some grit. Not even the bumbling Malloy brothers can save the sequel. We can only hope that Danny Ocean and his crew will not find the need for another outing.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Funny, stylish, brilliant!","It was just a question of time until Steven Soderbergh directed the next chapter of his 2001 remake of ""Ocean's Eleven"". Instead of adding another ""let's get quickly into the next casino or bank"" story like Rififi, Topkapi, Mission Impossible and, of course, Ocean's Eleven (old and new), Soderbergh's film rather pays tribute to Norman Jewison stylish luxury crime comedy ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" (1968), that was rather focusing on flashbacks, split screen action and a stylish surrounding instead of an extended plot.The story itself is not that important for the movie, but instead the film is battered with great scenes, witty dialogues, funny encounters, stylish settings, creative editing and camera ankles (check out the great sideway shot of an incoming airplane). The pacing is fast, and if you get lost within the sometimes illogical storyline you won't miss it, as there is always much going on here.The main actors Clooney, Damon, Pitt and Co. have much funny playing their roles, and even the rather boring and dull Julia Roberts has one really great scene when her character Tess is pretending to be.. guess... Julia Roberts in a hotel and museum scene. Bruce Willis (who has turned down Andy Garcia's role as casino owner in the first part) has a nice cameo in that scene, playing himself. Really funny! The supporting actors are also well-chosen. Catherine Zeta-Jones, playing a successful Europole inspector with leather coat, high heels and sexy hairstyle, is always bright and elegant. European actors Robbie Coltrane and Jerome Krabbe have also witty supporting appearances, and another big highlight is French actor Vincent Cassel, playing the elegant and arrogant master thief Night Fox (check out his great ""laser beam dance"" in the museum robbery!).The settings of Amsterdam, Paris, Rome and the Lake Come in Italy are also well-chosen and add weight to Danny Ocean's stylish gang. Pay attention to the score, too - David Holmes, who also provided the scores for Ocean's Eleven and Out Of Sight, has composed the definite ""sixties retro easy listening lounge sound track"" - just like an acid version of Ennio Morricone or Lalo Schifrin in 1969... great stuff and very original so that you don't realize when some of the older compositions of John Schroeder, Piero Umiliani or Roland Vincent can be heard in between!Enough for now, Ocean's Twelve is big fun to watch and one of my cinema highlights of 2004! I just wonder why it got so many bad reviews in the U.S.A. while the critics and audiences in Europe were much more positive and even enthusiastic about the film. Maybe they are more familiar with the settings, the style and the way of film making that Soderbergh chose for Ocean's Twelve... It's not just another conventional gangster movie rip-off, but a class of its own. I can't get enough of that... thank you, Mr Soderbergh!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Astounding and innovative from start to finish!,"Soderbergh has done it again with another great film. Better than Ocean's Eleven and more moving and innovative than the originals, Ocean's Twelve is a funny, entertaining, progressive, and colorful classic. The soundtrack is astounding and a great asset to the film; all the Old Italian music and the new David Holms is great. The cinematography by Chris Connier and Soderbergh is innovative and amazing, and as always it has the classic Soderbergh editing style. The plot is great. It takes you where you don't expect and it's not your stereotypical heist movie. See Ocean's Twelve for wildly entertaining two hours.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

I see movies on IMDb more deserving of that rating and this crap doesn't deserve even one point.I was robbed of my money, kind of ironic, isn't it? I tried so hard to get through this movie. I figured maybe I was a little too hard on it the first time I watched it. So, give it another chance I thought. I watched it again, I couldn't even make it through the beginning.

Love It Or Hate It?,"Definitely an improvement over the first, however, it takes your prior familiarity with the characters + style of the first film for it to land like it does.It's much more confident and breezy this time around, and you could accuse it of simply coasting on the first film's goodwill, however, Soderbergh pushes himself behind the camera. Different filmic influences drive how scenes are shot; at times it's almost documentarian. Selling the ease at which the camera operates is the chemistry between the expanding cast of characters and cameos. While this is definitely a heist film, what makes the Ocean's films sing are the actors' unwillingness to play up the dramatics, therefore taking away a major reason for you to care about the heists themselves. It honestly sounds like an anti-movie, and in many ways it kind of is, but that's probably why it's kinda brilliant. The movie is so hyper-aware of this that a major beat of the plot is centered around an encounter with Bruce Willis, playing himself.I wasn't totally sold on either the original or this year's Ocean's Eight, as Soderbergh just isn't quite there for me as a director, but I think he found the formula's sweet spot with this one.It's both a movie's movie and an anti-movie. Opinions seem divided on whether or not that's a good thing.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Non-story,"Having just rewatched this along with O11 and O13 I decided to throw in another no-go. Such a shame of a movie can not be underrated.Setting aside unnecessary self-references etc it has one major fault - there is no heist and no story. Instead we get a messy lot of events and circumstances that don't come together, the puzzle pieces never combine into the picture. And in the end we are told it was just another picture! well, we must have been seeing another movie, apparently. I wish I would.The lovestory between Rusty and Zeta-Jones character looks moderately promising at first but again in the end it just gets twisted stupidely and abruptly, only to hit the most hackneyed cliché you can imagine. Out of the blue, too.The acting is not bad nor outstanding, with the exception of Matt Damon who has greatly improved since O11 and has in fact the most interesting and funny scenes in the movie, and the brilliant Vincent Cassel who managed to make an enjoyable part out of the rather stupid and contrived character. Too bad it's just wasted in this crap. I was also impressed by the actress playing the small role of Linus' mom (can't recollect her name). But this couldn't help either.I guess it's too late to say Don't go see it but if you consider renting or buying just don't. It's not worth even pressing play button.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
Pillow Continuity,"I loved the movie. Just one issue with Julia Robert's (Tess) placing the pillow in the car driving from the airport vs. removing it at the Jail. Did anyone else notice the SQUARE pillow in the car and the ROUND pillow at the jail? I'm a frequent visitor to Amsterdam and love the scenes. I realized in my last visit there the Hotel is not actually on the corner. It exists, but is not actually located in the spot where it is shown. I particularly enjoy the music in this movie. It is very much different from conventional movie music and very refreshing. It isn't the kind of music that I would go out and buy but it seemed to fit the scenes and really complimented the story. I have watched this movie at least a dozen times now and I get a kick out of it every time. It is hard to follow because there is so much happening and it moves back and forth to different locations and scenes. You have to see it more than once to fully appreciate it.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Semi-enjoyable, overall a letdown with questionable cinematography","Ocean's 12 is destined to be relegated to the pile of sequels that didn't live up to the original. Watching it made me wonder if I was viewing a 'final draft' cut as some of the cuts and 'shaky cam' footage were distracting and some of the cinematography was frustrating (ie: bright background with a foreground so dark that actors' features weren't detailed during dialog.) Seeing as a lot of the movie is set outdoors or in a large rundown warehouse it was never going to be as aesthetically beautiful as the original with its Las Vegas setting.Content wise the movie stops and starts which slows down the continuity. The original (original meaning the movie from a couple of years ago) had a definite Bad Guy, a definite Goal and a definite direction towards that goal; that isn't the case here. A few plot lines are created that are left unresolved and some of the other plot lines have sizeable holes dotted through them.A couple of comic moments (particularly the cameo and the 'impersonation') are wonderful and prevent the movie from becoming lifeless. If you enjoy 'I know what happened, but how did it happen?' movies then this is worth watching and if you're a fan of Catherine Zeta-Jones you'll love this movie as she's absolutely beautiful in it, but if you're expecting Andy Garcia to play a prominent role (his Bad Guy in the original was great) you'll be disappointed; if you're expecting a high-tech crime movie with believable techy stuff you'll be very disappointed; if you're expecting a visually great movie (which is a fair expectation considering the Rome/Amsterdam setting) you'll be disappointed.The under-use of Andy Garcia's character makes me believe that he'll be the main Bad Guy again if significant box intake results in another movie - but don't bank on it.2.5 / 5.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

Andy gave an great performance and the wardrobe brought out his best. I thought to myself, as one who can dress, the clothing was remarkable from a movie watcher. Kurland and Messina really did their homework to design the wardrobe and the set.Also Brad Pitts wardrobe was very slick.

Different & smart sequel,"Actually i wanted to give the film 8/10 but somehow clicked the button while it slipped to 10 somehow! Anyway, the film is quite good, i understand why many didn't like it but at first i was confused as how they got the Fabergé egg, but when i saw it a second time, i realized i had missed about 4 seconds that explained it all. It would be fair to say that the team this time got away with murder, seeing the way they got to it first before the Night Fox, it does amount to cheating but hey, this is robbery and he did bring it on himself by ratting out on them all for his inflated ego. the film veers quite a distance from the first one, i guess soderbergh was smart not to repeat himself or copy the same formula which would have been terribly boring. Instead, he changes it a bit & adds a different colour & dimensions to the characters. If someone wants to see a replica of Oceans eleven, then perhaps they wont appreciate 12 a lot, i prefer twelve to eleven as it was smarter & stylish. The bit where they try to fool the museum by pretending Julia Roberts is actually,Julia Roberts is quite an inventive piece, not to mention hilarious as well. I think for twelve to have been a really great film ,it would've been half an hour longer. The Night Fox is really more subtle & perhaps better than they are, after all, he is only one person & they are eleven, or are they now twelve? I didn't make out who is £ 12 now, Catherine zeta Jones or Vincent Cassel, cos at the end of the film one can clearly see there's gonna be a third installment & i hope there is, perhaps next time they rob a Japanese/Chinese museum, or attempt to steal diamonds from Africa, whatever they do i hope the same cast returns! Only thing i didn't like in the film was brad Pitt's hair!",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"I may be in the minority, but I thought it was slightly better than Ocean's 11...","Stylish. Original. Full of personality. All words used to describe Johnny Betts' hair. But, interestingly enough, they also form an accurate description of Ocean's 12.This sequel has much of the same feel as Ocean's 11, but it takes a slightly different approach. Rather than focus on the heist, it gives more attention to the characters and their attempts at getting out of the trouble they're facing. In the first one, the movie starts off by introducing us to each of the main characters. Here, we watch as Andy Garcia tracks each one down and issues his threat - pay him his money within two weeks or suffer the consequences.Also, in Ocean's 11, everything seemed to fall into place for our beloved thieves. Not anymore. Now everything seems to go wrong, and the crew finds itself face-to-face with one obstacle after another. I'm just curious, is it bad to cheer for thieves and wish them the best? It's OK if it's just a movie, right? I sure hope so.You're dying to know which movie I preferred, right? No? Well I'll tell you anyway. I know I'll probably be in the minority here, but I enjoyed Ocean's 12 a little more than Ocean's 11. Why? Well, since you asked:* Catherine Zeta-Jones! Finally, some eye candy for the guys! And no, Julia Roberts is NOT eye candy, except for people with a skeleton fetish. Plus, CZJ (as I like to call her) does a good job in her role as a detective with a father who was a thief. Her character adds another element of mystery.* It's funnier than the first. Two great sources of comedy are the cameos of Bruce Willis and Topher Grace as themselves. Topher whines about how his Kabbalah bracelet isn't working, and when talking about the efforts he took to try to win the love of a girl he claims, ""I totally phoned in that Dennis Quaid movie."" I won't say anything about Bruce's cameo, but it's great. The humor is mainly a reflection of how much everybody obviously enjoyed making this movie.* I do not like Julia Roberts. I have NEVER understood her appeal. And not to be shallow, but I don't find her the least bit attractive. So how is that relevant to why I prefer Ocean's 12? Well, Julia was a distraction in Ocean's 11, but here she has one enjoyable scene that made me not think about how much I can't stand her! When a movie can do that, then it has really accomplished something.* The story is a little smarter, a little more clever than the first one. Some people might not like the fact that everything isn't spelled out along the way, but I enjoyed being kept in the dark a bit.The important thing is that all is revealed at the end. I know a couple of people complained that they didn't understand everything because the story wasn't told in a linear fashion. One complaint was that the big revelation was ""unfair"" because it prevented the viewer from being able to figure everything out on his own. Fine with me. What's wrong with surprises?One guy even complained that the ending was the movie's attempt to make you pay to go see the movie again just to understand it. I would have to disagree. I had no problem following the story, and you don't really have to watch it again to figure it all out, but it's one I *do* want to watch again so I can approach it with a different perspective.I recommend watching Ocean's 11 first. If you've already seen it, then it wouldn't hurt to watch it again just as a refresher. Once you've done that you'll be ready to enjoy Ocean's 12. Just don't yell and scream at me if *you* end up not liking it as much Ocean's 11. After all, it's just a movie, and the fact that we have a different preference won't prevent a cure for cancer. If it does, then that'll sure be weird and I pledge to never see another movie again because man, it's just not worth stopping a cure for cancer.THE GISTA little more clever, and a little funnier than its predecessor, Ocean's 12 presents itself as yet another slick and stylish movie in the heist genre. If you can handle a little style over substance, then you should be entertained. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and neither should you.Rating: 4 (out of 5)",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

However, this movie, while offering something very different than ""Oceans 11,"" is arguably as good as (and in my opinion -better-) than the first.Introducing Frenchman Vincent Cassel as François Toulour, aka the Night Fox, the Oceans series take on some serious international flair as the Ocean's team battle it out for the Faberge Egg on Toulour's home turf. Cassel plays up Frech snobbery to a fine art as he seems to crush Ocean's efforts at every turn with attitude and astonishing acrobatics.Meanwhile, the entire Ocean's Eleven are back, with an important role for the 12th Ocean, Tess (Julia Roberts), this time.What makes this film succeed is excellent plot twists that hinge on the whirl-wind tour of European locations that host the film.

The Real Heist in Ocean's Twelve Occurs when Steven Soderbergh walks off laughing with your Money...,"Well, the joke's on him, because I bought a two-film set of Ocean's 11 and 12 together, for 50p. So, technically, he only got 25p off me for this,and I probably did get about 50p worth of enjoyment from ""11"" - although not a great deal more. It was okay; it was fun and silly, with a cast of a few annoying people, and some decent ones. But anyway; back to this one.Oh, there must have been tears of laughter rolling down the director's cheeks when he made this movie. It is so jam-packed with self-knowing nudges and winks, and quite frankly, ends up way, way too far up it's own bottom. The actual plot itself is negligible, and seems to ratchet everything up to 101, and then resolve it with some ridiculous contrivance. Even the humour falls flat, what little there is - the Robbie Coltrane jargon scene at the bar especially is an appalling piece of cinematic showing off, and not only isn't funny, or witty, or absurd, is actually embarrassing. In fact, the entire film, is embarrassing.The main talking point of the film, comes when Tess, played by Julia Roberts, decides to pull off a stupid robbery, by disguising herself...as Julia Roberts. Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha...No, seriously. That's ridiculous, and not even vaguely clever. Then Bruce Willis turns up,playing himself, proving the rule that every film with Bruce Willis in it, is total rubbish. This is such arrogant, self-important claptrap, that it happily demolishes everything in sight with a brainless, relentless absurdity, which, when the dust finally settles, leaves you with the feeling that someone has, quite sincerely, just robbed you of time and money, and stuck their middle finger in your face for two hours.I give this movie two out of ten, because I love Brad Pitt, who plays this entire film with a bored, I can't be bothered with life swagger, and does seem rather fed up; Catherine Zeta-Jones, who is usually good fun, and sometimes quite a good actress, and the marvellous Vincent Cassell, star of ""La Haine"", and ""Black Swan"", who gets a chance to strut his stuff here with some cool acrobatics, but little else. Because any character development, or decent acting all just gets in the way of this film's overwhelming desire to spit on everything, to outdo itself in stupid gags, and unrealistic plot turns. To be honest,it lacks even the superficial gloss which the first movie had. That had twists in it, sure, but this movie has so many twists, that it doesn't even have a story. It's just an absurd collection of infantile rubbish, held together by three decent actors, that has guaranteed itself future economic success by plonking itself square in the middle of a trilogy, and has come after a fairly decent first movie.I don't know how to impress upon you strongly enough, but even if you thought the first movie was THE BEST FILM YOU HAVE EVR SEEN IN YOUR ENTIRE LIFE - In which case, you are probably beyond helping anyway, due to your terrible taste in films - but even if this was the case with you PLEASE...I beg of you...do not give Steven Soderbergh the satisfaction he deserves. This is a travesty of film-making, and its smug laziness does not deserve to con more innocents out of their money. So do everyone a favour - if you want a star-studded, comedy/thriller movie...then watch ""Hot Fuzz"". Or ""Charlie's Angels"". Or, Heck...watch anything. Just not this movie.(And, if you're still here after all this ranting...it's worth mentioning that this ain't the worst film I've ever seen in my life. I just feel incredibly cheated right now, and have the urge to convey that feeling to others. I'm sure it'll go away soon enough...But, goodness, has this put me off watching the third one, or what?)",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
Booooring!!!,"Usually a sequel to a movie isn't as good as the first one is, with the exception of LOTR. Well, Ocean's 12 is exactly that, only worse beyond belief. I was so disappointed when I got home that evening. I half hope that Steven will make an Ocean's 13 to make up for this disaster. The camera angles were horrible; I mean what was up with the sideways thing when the airplane was coming into the airport? In addition, it kept shaking too; I had to look away from the screen to prevent getting a headache. The music was pretty bad. I know it's supposed to go with the whole ""we're in Europe thing"" but it's not crime/caper music really, and I think that's more important than the setting. And the plot. The plot wasn't as strong as it should have been. It felt more like the producers were just trying to make some more money, but they ran out of good ideas. Paying Benedict back? I don't think a gang of thieves would really want to do that. And bringing ""The Night Fox"" and Isabel Lahiri into the picture doesn't help it much; it just complicates things and makes it hard to follow. Like in the beginning, scenes just flashed before your eyes, and the only thing that's flashing through your head is ""Huh???"" And because it's confusing, you don't figure out how they actually did the job. In 11, their plan was clearer even if they didn't actually tell you. In 12, even with the flashback at the end, it's hard to comprehend. Did I mention how dull it was yet? You find your mind wandering, thinking about dinner and what you're going to do when you get home that night. The only good thing I found about this movie was the cast, but even Brad didn't look his sharpest.

12 is an unlucky number,"A director of the calibre of Steven Soderbergh should stay clear of a re-make, but it worked handsomely with ""Ocean's Eleven"", and he should avoid like the plague a sequel, as proved by the bitter disappointment that is ""Ocean's Twelve"".This is all style and no substance. The style comes from Soderbergh's lively camera-work, the location shooting in Amsterdam and Rome, and the re-engagement of all the stars from the original movie plus Catherine Zeta-Jones as the twelfth character. The lack of substance comes from the absence of set-piece action and a convoluted plot that involves too many flash-backs and twists. The dialogue is poor and the music is over-loud but, above all, the whole thing is totally derivative - of the first film, of ""The Italian Job"" (foreign gang in Italian city), of ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" (male thief has relationship with female investigator), of ""Octopussy"" (theft of Fabergé egg), of ""Entrapment"" (cat burglar evading laser beams) and even ""Notting Hill"" (Julia Roberts playing herself).For Soderbergh, twelve is clearly an unlucky number and he would be crazy to even think of ""Ocean's 13"".",,Anonymous,Crime
Soderbergh at his finest,"The people who are slating this film are truly missing the joke. Ocean's Twelve is beautifully and cleverly shot and shows Soderbergh's true style. The comedy within the film is superb and the cast truly know how to make fun of themselves and their real life celebrity. The film does not have the slick style of the first but has now more of the mark of a Soderbergh film with many of his signature style shots, an example being when the film comes together and goes from black and white into colour, which is reminiscent of a great scene in Kafka. As most film-goers, I expected the film to look and feel the same as the first but the film far exceeded my expectations. Soderbergh has truly put his own mark on the film, far more so than the first. The combinations of different filming styles are excellent and suit their scenes perfectly, the music is spot on and the humour exceeds the first. To all the people who are disappointed purely because they expected the film to be exactly the same as the first should be more open minded and embrace the freshness of this film that retains a great plot, acting, and humour with a new visual style.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Isn't 13 supposed to be the unlucky number?,"Do me a favor. Imagine you're tasked with coming up with a sequel - for any movie. What do you think is the first thing you need to do? You need to discover the ""soul"" of the original film and use it as the foundation for the sequel. In the case of Ocean's Eleven, you're talking about a heist. Then, you'd look at tone. There's a lot of cool, smooth, cleverness going on with a hint of comedy that blends in very well with everything else to make one well-oiled machine. But that's not what the writers of Ocean's Twelve did.They made a fatal mistake with the foundation of the film. Instead of being primarily about a smart and clever heist, it's about the actors having a good time together. That focus single-handedly got rid of a main heist, transitioning the film into something aimless and convoluted and turned an originally colorful group of characters into a saturated mess that all blend together and no longer play an independent role in the outcome of the filmFurthermore, the type of comedy went from smooth and subtle to over-the-top and even slapstick, which went into some weird and random sound editing issues, like a scene in the beginning where Don Cheadle's character is complaining about them bleeping out curse words in a song while the movie was using phone rings to bleep out cussing in the same scene. It makes no sense with the rest of the movie, only that random scene, and the ringtone was synced with the use of swearing, it was inconsistently patterned so it wasn't even a clever use of swearing either. It is so....bad.I could go on and on...I just don't get it.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
dropped the ball,"In my 22 years of life, I have never fallen asleep in a movie theatre, until today. I loved Ocean's Eleven, but this movie failed at every point where the previous Ocean film was successful. It was extremely boring. It was one of those movies where a lot of stuff is happening, so you have to pay attention, but the film is so boring, it is nearly impossible to pay attention to the film. One thing this film asks you to do is pretend that the characters you are watching, are not quite the same as the characters in Oceans Eleven. First off, when Benedict comes after them demanding his money, all the characters flip out, like they are completely scared to death of Benedict, but in the first film, they behaved as though they had no fear of him.

Ocean's 11 was fantastic this one went in the other direction...,"Ocean's 11 was amazing. A hiest movie that was highly entertaining, while coming across as serious but also lighthearted at the same time.Ocean's 12 dumps all that into the Ocean. It starts off by completly negating the first movie by making it's ending (Ocean's 11) pointless. This left a bad taste in my mouth immediately. Then the movie gets going but goes nowhere. IT'S boring!The writing behind this one felt very weak. The characters are somehow shallower than the first movie even though we already know these guys. The ending still leaves me a little puzzled. Suddenly the person pursuing Ocean and his team changes their mind because of feelings... it felt weak and forced.I regretted re-watching this one and can't recommend it.

"A little less conversation, a little more action please","Since he claims he's the only guy who had no fun while making ""Ocean's 11,"" Steve Soderbergh must have done this sequel either:A) For the money. Lots of money. B) Because his actor buddies begged him to. C) Because the first one was so successful he'd be allowed to do anything he wanted with a sequel.I'm voting for ""C"". He must have said under his breath: ""Well, I'm doing a sequel but I'm damn sure not making the same movie over again.""And you've got to respect that, even if it means a not-as-great final product. This one is a lot of fun but totally forgettable, where the first one was a lot of fun and you couldn't stop thinking about it (probably because it was about one possible scam instead of half a dozen impossible ones). Either flick is worth the price of a ticket - you'll never know whether or not you'll like 'em by reading other people's comments. Even though they are ""conventional movies,"" they don't lend themselves to conventional analysis. They're like those awful ""star-studded"" TV movies from the 70's - except extremely well executed by seriously talented filmmakers.This movie is not about master thieves; it's about cool and in-jokes and about watching really really famous, really really rich and attractive people having a great time together. The only person who actually gives a performance in ""Ocean's 12"" is Catherine Zeta-Jones and all I could think was: ""Cathy! I know that's Steve over there but this is not 'Traffic'!

Oceanic Letdown,"If you haven't seen the previous installment ( Ocean's 11 ), this sequel is actually decent entertainment. For those of us who enjoyed the brilliantly conceived casino heist in Ocean's 11, and who were hoping for an encore, Ocean's 12 is a disappointment, like most recent sequels. This franchise main theme, as enunciated in the first installment, is spectacularly clever heists by a crew of world class robbers. Moviegoers expect sequels to live up to the established theme. Ocean's 12 fails to abide by this principle. There is no substantive heist in Ocean's 12 to speak of. Robbery scenes, if any at all, are rushed, and hardly completed by even more rushed retrospective/flashback sequences. The folks who produced this flick just couldn't muster the patience requisite to achieve a comprehensive heist scene which made Ocean's 11 so compeling. The Break dancing inspired Yoga job, against a security laser barrier, by the French master robber, is so not believable as to be galactically pathetic. You actually feel robbed after watching that sub-moronic scene. This is an hackneyed sequel, probably rushed to the screen to ensure that the all star cast here is retained to capitalize on the success of Ocean's 11, and what we get is pure cinematic platitude. If you'd like to moderately enjoy this film, you must forget about the previous installment.",,Anonymous,Crime
the critics are dumb,"I thought it was really cute, all the critics said it was bad, but they seem to think the movie is trying to be deep. It's no Pulp Fiction, but it's not supposed to be!

I guess if there's one thing I'd change about the movie, it's that the Night Fox isn't someone famous, it woulda been funnier if he were like Johnny Depp or something. Same with Lemar, I mean, the guy who plays him is kinda famous, but it woulda been better if it were like James Garner or something.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
There IS Chemistry,"There is certainly chemistry between these actors, and that helped Soderbergh's first, ""Ocean's"" redux immensely. It's not enough to save this, flash-back, flash-forward, shtick-heavy farce. The least he could have done was write a story, and tell it; narrative would have helped. I guess the budget allowed for lots of partying, so they did that instead of making a movie. The music is good; not ans good ans Soderbergh's first Ocean's movie. The locations are great, and I'm not going to pretend that I don't want to be an extra on one of sets. This budget could have paid for a screenwriter and still paid all of the salaries. It's fun to look at, but the lack of story, and jerky camera work gives me motion sickness.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime

A Mixed Bag,"Ocean's 12 is a rather disappointing sequel. It's not a bad movie, but it is not a great one either, certainly nowhere as good as Ocean's 11. To be Frank, it is a mess. Whereas 11 had a great pacing, seemed very classy and made the heist fun, 12 has a plot that is very jumbled rushed while trying too hard to both serve as a sequel while also standing out uniquely on its own.But worst of all, the movie is just tried to do too many things in one movie which makes the film confusing, lose its pacing, and downright silly at times. There's the basic premise of Dominic collecting, then there's their heist to get the funds, then there's also the Night Fox who's working against them, then there's also the mystery of LeMarc the so called most notorious thief, then there's Rusty's ex who's an Interpol agent trying to stop them while Rusty tries to win her back much like Danny did with Tess in the first movie, and then there's the various problems the team runs into, on top of various twists I won't list due to spoilers. As you can see, it quickly gets to be too much keep track of and fully engaged.However the acting is still phenomenal all around. Everyone plays their parts well and you can once again see the great chemistry between the crew, even with the addition of Catherine Zeta Jones and Bruce Willis. That alone is the films saving grace. It's rare to see a cast still deliver 100% even if they know the script is lacking. And so I'm left torn with neither liking nor disliking the movie. I still think Ocean's 13 is far stronger follow up, but I also don't regret watching 12.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Danny and the crew are back for more adventure and high-stakes thievery.,"Starring: George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Matt Damon, Catherine Zeta-Jones I found Ocean's Eleven to be a highly entertaining crime caper of a movie.I didn't like the ending because it left everything hanging out, saying one of two things. First, we don't know how to properly end a movie. Second, there's a sequel underway.Fortunately, it was the latter.At the end of Eleven, Danny and the boys get away with their heist, but Terry Benedict's goons are watching them and following them.Enter Ocean's Twelve. Benedict is still a little less than thrilled about being robbed and insulted by Danny and the crew, and he wants his money back. Plus interest. This presents a slight problem, as most of the guys have squandered their ""hard earned"" dollars on God only knows what. Hence the premise of the movie; Danny and his fellow ten thieves have fourteen days to come up with the money they took from Terry.The plot of the movie is not terribly difficult to follow if you have more than three quarters of your brain functioning. Translation, it's a good popcorn flick. Nothing wrong with those in my opinion.One drawback to Twelve when compared to Eleven is that there isn't a big, masterful, detailed heist to watch. This may be a slight disappointment to some, but I found it to work just fine, as it gave the director the opportunity to zoom the lens in on the characters and focus on the individuals behind the crimes.The movie does have some very cool scenes and some highly amusing ones as well. For example, there is an amusing segment where Tess has to pretend to be Julia Roberts. This is hardly a perfect film by any stretch, but I would still rank it as a worthy sequel.On a somewhat unrelated note, Julia Roberts is thirty eight. It is not natural for someone to still be that fine when they're pushin' forty.Bottom Line: 3.5 out of 4 (worth a look)",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Better Than the Original,"I guess I'm one of the few in here that actually enjoyed seeing this film. I think that the chemistry between all the characters is what helps makes this one of the funniest films of the year. I especially loved how Tess was made part of the plot this time, even though she only appeared in a small part of the film. Also, the thing I liked about it was that it pretty much had an indy feel to it for me. It pretty much looked like Soderberg wanted to give that look to the film as a way of almost filming it as a documentary. However, the thing that really made me enjoy this film was the fact that it had me laughing almost from beginning to end. This film works well as both a comedy and as a caper film and it really made it one of the most enjoyable experiences that I had at a theater.",,Anonymous,Crime

Oceans Twelve: Old-fashioned nice,"Oceans Twelve is without doubt a very nice movie. Not a single murder finds place  just the threat of it. There is even almost no violence at all. It is old-fashioned thieving, not a robbery. Another thing that feels old fashioned is the amount of Hollywood movie stars playing in the movie. Some people got aggravated because of the number of Brad Pitts and Julie Robberts, but this couldn't bother me at all: They all do what their good at: acting. If you think this is annoying, you are probably the kind of person who hates pretty people. Old-fashioned is also certainly the charming atmosphere, one of the best things of Oceans Twelve, the interaction between the characters. The Oceans club feels nice, like a family you want to be part of. The younger ones behave like boys you can't refuse to like. Danny Ocean himself is a bit like a nice uncle: the one that always makes jokes and buys the ticket for the first time in a roller coaster. But the best thing is the way the story keeps changing. This may happen one time to often, it's still a very nice surprise. Especially compared to all the predictable Hollywood blockbusters of the past years. Concluding is Oceans Twelve a really nice movie, made to surprise you with more nice things every minute. Everyone who's not charmed by this one had probably a very bad Christmas and can't stand looking to people who oblivious having fun. If you like looking to something nice with a lot of surprises, this movie is yours.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Soderbergh's direction is both sleek and playful, enhancing the film's stylish aesthetic. The cinematography, combined with a jazzy score, creates an atmosphere that perfectly complements the film's tone.The screenplay is sharp and filled with clever twists, blending humor with high-stakes tension. The interactions among the characters are a highlight, with standout performances from the ensemble cast, including Julia Roberts, who adds a layer of meta-commentary by playing a character who impersonates her own cinematic persona.While some viewers may find the plot a bit convoluted, the film's self-aware humor and engaging dialogue more than compensate for any confusion. It embraces its own absurdity, making it a delightful ride for fans of heist films.In conclusion, ""Ocean's Twelve"" is a stylish and witty continuation of the beloved franchise, brimming with clever twists and captivating performances.

Twelve is the new Eleven,"Who needs twelve drummers drumming when you've got twelve con artists and thieves vying for ways to steal $190 million in two weeks? Why $190 million? That's the amount stolen from Las Vegas casino owner Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) in Ocean's Elevenand he wants his money backwith interest! Set three years after the end of the Eleven escapades, Danny Ocean (George Clooney) reassembles his eleven con artists and thieves, adding one new team member, to appease an angry Benedict who only gives the team two weeks to return all of the cash. Meanwhile, Ocean's Twelve tries to avoid confrontations with an inexplicable French rival called the ""Night Fox"" and dodge Europol agent Isabel Lehiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones). All bets are off. Directed by Steven Soderbergh proves something. With eleven announced production jobs currently, Soderbergh has it in for himself. Not only did he direct Ocean's Eleven, but he has also directed other magnificent films such as Traffic, Erin Brockovich, and The Limey. One large incentive to seeing Ocean's Twelve is the acting. This movie definitely screams big names. Co-stars George Clooney (Intolerable Cruelty, O Brother, Where Art Thou?) and Brad Pitt (Troy, Meet Joe Black) really complement each other. Other stars of Ocean's Twelve include Matt Damon (The Bourne Identity), Catherine Zeta-Jones (The Terminal), Andy Garcia (Night Falls On Manhattan), and Julia Roberts (Closer). The difference between this original and its sequel is the dialogue. When watching Ocean's Eleven, one is on the edge of the seat, but in Ocean's Twelve one finds himself laughing more. The excess humor in the sequel gives it a different taste than the original. The cinematography in this film is definitely accentuated by the variety. The many different camera angles and transitions in this motion picture truly amazed me. The storyline adds its spice, allowing this movie to shine. Musically, the mood was well conveyed through the music. There were times when I could notice the disposition being expressed by simple music. As an apparent success, Ocean's Twelve was number one at the Box-Office its first weekend. Competing with Blade: Trinity, which came out Wednesday December 8, wasn't a hard task. Ocean's Twelve took in $39.2 million right away, leaving Blade: Trinity to $24.5 million gross and National Treasure to third place in the dust. With a mild PG-13 rating for brief language, the film is peppered with language but doesn't take over the movie. Overall, Ocean's Twelve was to my liking.

"Twelve, is the new Eleven","Who needs twelve drummers drumming when you've got twelve con artists and thieves vying for ways to steal $190 million in two weeks? Why $190 million? That's the amount stolen from Las Vegas casino owner Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) in Ocean's Elevenand he wants his money backwith interest! Set three years after the end of the Eleven escapades, Danny Ocean (George Clooney) reassembles his eleven con artists and thieves, adding one new team member, to appease an angry Benedict who only gives the team two weeks to return all of the cash. Meanwhile, Ocean's Twelve tries to avoid confrontations with an inexplicable French rival called the ""Night Fox"" and dodge Europol agent Isabel Lehiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones). All bets are off. Directed by Steven Soderbergh proves something. With eleven announced production jobs currently, Soderbergh has it in for himself. Not only did he direct Ocean's Eleven, but he has also directed other magnificent films such as Traffic, Erin Brockovich, and The Limey. One large incentive to seeing Ocean's Twelve is the acting. This movie definitely screams big names. Co-stars George Clooney (Intolerable Cruelty, O Brother, Where Art Thou?) and Brad Pitt (Troy, Meet Joe Black) really complement each other. Other stars of Ocean's Twelve include Matt Damon (The Bourne Identity), Catherine Zeta-Jones (The Terminal), Andy Garcia (Night Falls On Manhattan), and Julia Roberts (Closer). The difference between this original and its sequel is the dialogue. When watching Ocean's Eleven, one is on the edge of the seat, but in Ocean's Twelve one finds himself laughing more. The excess humor in the sequel gives it a different taste than the original. The cinematography in this film is definitely accentuated by the variety. The many different camera angles and transitions in this motion picture truly amazed me. The storyline adds its spice, allowing this movie to shine. Musically, the mood was well conveyed through the music. There were times when I could notice the disposition being expressed by simple music. As an apparent success, Ocean's Twelve was number one at the Box-Office its first weekend. Competing with Blade: Trinity, which came out Wednesday December 8, wasn't a hard task. Ocean's Twelve took in $39.2 million right away, leaving Blade: Trinity to $24.5 million gross and National Treasure to third place in the dust. With a mild PG-13 rating for brief language, the film is peppered with language but doesn't take over the movie. Overall, Ocean's Twelve was to my liking. Without a seat available in the theatre, the success of this movie was outstanding. I'm glad that Clooney was more appealing than Wesley Snipes, otherwise, I'd be frightened with the world I'm living in.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

No meat with the potatoes,"I could just see the studio execs sitting around their cozy meeting room, drinking their triple mocha cappuccino's and reacting to the producers' pitch.I imagine the producer saying, 'I have an idea for a movie that will have George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts, Carl Reiner, Bernie Mac, Don Chedale, Andy Garcia and Elliot Gould together again. And this time I even got Catherine Zeta-Jones to join the cast. Oh yeah, Steven Sodebergh will direct and I have even convinced Bruce Willis and Topher Grace to do cameos..And did I mention that this is a sequel to the $450 million worldwide grossing Ocean's 11 and that the stars are willing to negotiate back end deals in order to keep the budget the same as the first film?'I imagine there would be a pause. Not a pause to consider whether or not to greenlight the project, but a pause so that they could picture themselves naked in a mountain of money or maybe a pause just long enough to let the adrenaline run through their bodies and the goosebumps and hairs on the back of their necks a chance to return to their normal state.Well, whatever the conversation, the boys are back (sorry Julia and Catherine) again in Ocean's Twelve which is also a follow-up to the remake of the 1960 movie staring Rat Packers Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr.Ocean's Twelve picks up a few years after the original ended. If you recall, in their first crack at collective crime, the group elaborately emptied the Bellagio, The Mirage and the MGM Grand casinos' vault in Las Vegas of about $150 million. Well, for some reason, that just didn't sit well with Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) who not only lost the casino's money a job for which he was responsible - but also his girlfriend Tess (Julia Roberts) to the mastermind behind the group, Danny Ocean (George Clooney). Thanks to an anonymous tip (that really makes no sense when revealed) , Benedict has been given the location of all eleven thieves responsible for the original heist. Benedict seems to be holding a vindictive grudge that is rather hard to understand, really. The insurance covered the losses, and Benedict never even lost his job as a result of the debacle. But for some reason, he is willing to put his life on hold until a personal vendetta is resolved.After tracking down each character individually (and did we really need to see the bit characters being visited one by one by Benedict and his entourage of men without necks?) Benedict reveals that they have two weeks to return to him the money they stole plus interest. Just one problem. It has been a few years since the heist and everyone has bit into their nest egg leaving them over $90 million short. So, they put their collective minds together and decide to do what they do best, steal.This is where the movie should have gone into overdrive, but instead it gets muttered in its own stylish format. They first decide to steal a trade ticket worth about $2.5 million (which would only leave them with 99% of the total still to be recovered). Of course, it's again an elaborate plan consisting of an idea that is so ridiculously improbable that if not for the confusion I felt trying to understand the hows and whys of the plan, I undoubtedly would have chuckled out loud in my theatre seat.But this was only an audience diversion to introduce us to The Night Fox who is a competing thief looking to wear the heavyweight belt as undisputed crook of the millennium. The Night Fox is able to get a message to Danny Ocean and after a brief meeting, agrees to pay the marker owed to Benedict if Ocean and his puppy dog posse can steal a jewel studded egg before him. Ahhh, is there no honor amongst thieves?So with the plot now spelled out like a spoonful of Alpha-Bits, all that is left is the star power banter, a twist or two to keep us interested and enough screen time for each cast member to keep us at arms length from any kind of character development whatsoever. In fact, never have so many A-list stars wasted so much opportunity by trying to be cool or volleying the ball to the next A-list star, none of which seem capable of spiking.Not all was a bust mind you. Catherine Zeta-Jones was an interesting character although very underdeveloped and lacking any clear motivation for her actions. And Julia Roberts has the only memorable scene in the film when she pretends to be a particular diva in a hotel that is so tongue-in-cheek I felt like I was coming down with the measles.Director Steven Soderbergh is a good director, but I can't help think that he is overrated and it is his relationships with the stars that has kept him on the hot list rather than his filmography. Since Erin Brokovich in 2000, he has had under performer after under performer including Solaris and Full Frontal. But still, Julia Roberts and George Clooney seem to praise him on every talk show or awards dinner spewed out of Hollywood, California. In hindsight, I can see why actors must like him so much and that is because he doesn't seem to be that demanding or envelope pushing. Ocean's Twelve is the perfect example of keeping a bunch of stars happy and somewhat occupied without putting any meat beside my potatoes. Instead of trying to dwell on one or two characters and develop a sub-plot or storyline of any interest, he decides instead to allow each of the actors to leave their back room poker games to eat up screen time that is shot with an independent sense, even if no common sense follows.Anyone who watches television will see anyone of the stars either separately talking to someone behind a desk or collectively as a promotional vehicle for the film, talk about how much fun they all had together during the shoot. The practical jokes, the European experience and even staying at George Clooney's villa where poker games were a daily ritual. It's just too bad that none of this same fun could have been transformed on screen for the benefit of the audience that, in my screening, seemed bored to a point where illuminated watch faces glowed like firefly's as uninterested patrons were collectively counting down the films running time.With all the star power and the international appeal, Ocean's Twelve will no doubt make poop-loads of money and it won't be long before Ocean's Fourteen (Thirteen is bad luck) will be drafted and in front of the ensemble for review and schedule juggling. I just hope next time, Soderbergh decides to sit that one out and only produce while a script provides us with more than cute dimples and starring glances for two hours.www.gregsrants.com",4.0,Anonymous,Crime

nobody likes a sequel....,"and most of the time I don't either...I had actually been putting off watching this film, at first in the theater and then on cable. I am glad that I finally did watch it. I actually liked it better than the first one. The first one (Ocean's Eleven) I found a bit cliché (particularly the relationship between Julia Robert's and George Clooney), combined with Vegas (think ""Casino"" just not as good) and bit slow pace (no better pacing than ""Thief"" with James Caan - 1981).I would give Ocean's Eleven a 7.Ocean's Twelve has a better pace and I found it to be more humorous. I see some complaints on here about the Julia Robets role in this one, but I found her ""cameo"" role to be quite funny and original (and I am no big fan by any means).Although the whole Ocean's series is a bit overblown with the casting, I kept wondering what would happen next and that was due to good writing and directing along with the acting. Europe looked really gorgeous in this movie, they picked out some special locations (and I am living in Europe these days).Basically Ocean's Twelve kept me entertained and I give it a good recommendation next to most other films out there these days.Solid 8 - Enjoy!",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

The plot is not only boring but also senseless. I honestly don't even know what it was all about. I left the movie after 3 quarters and got some coffee with another girl who didn't like it. Much more pleasure I can tell you that. But even the guys who stayed till the end later reported to me that the plot continued being awful and useless. My advice: Don't watch.

Forget Ocean's XI and you will enjoy this movie,"I have been waiting for Ocean's XII ever since the day I finished watching Ocean's XI. My joy knew no bounds when I heard it was going to have an international release and will be released on 10th December itself in India.To many of the fans of the first movie, that is the biggest problem. When we walk into the movie hall, the expectation is to have some thing similar to Ocean's XI. Its a sequel. But if you do every thing similar, where lies the fun?Ocean's XII has much comedy, many special scenes specially involving Matt Damon who doesn't disappoint in the movie and a fast track which can be too fast for some at times. Ocean's XI was much simpler in the sense that it had one robbery and one villain in Benedict. The goal was clear.Here, we have various characters who 'think' for themselves a lot more and are very real. If you forget the minor supposedly intelligent aspects like some viewer questioned how Zeta Jones found Pitt and walked straight into his door and think about the motives of the characters more and stress on the plot, the movie becomes a classic.There is the character of Roberts who was totally underplayed in Ocean XI, Benedict revealing he wants the money and interest and isn't concerned with any thing else, the Blue Fox, and practically all characters had suffiecient air time and interesting cameos.You laugh more watching this movie. It makes you feel awed with scenes such as Damon, Clooney and Pitt walking on the road and talking. I liked their combination a lot. The comic moments like the short guy getting deported to a completely different city because of a mistake is hilarious.The only reason many people feel or will feel disappointed is they don't actually see the final 'stealing of the egg' as it were. Or maybe like me you had a hugh expectation from the movie.Had I not seen Ocean's XI, I am sure I would have given this movie a 9/10I felt a wee bit disappointed there wasn't a more dramatic ending which i also a reason I sadly ended up giving it just a 7/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

If the filmmakers don't care about what they're doing, why should we? The movie is so detached it's almost like a camera was pointed at the actors and they just improvised the entire thing. In addition, most of the actors are completely wasted.

This time Catherine Zeta-Jones joins in for some weighty dressage and Vincent Cassel is along as some sort of break-dancing Raffles dude.

No Need For This Movie,"Sometimes a movie is made just for the sake of being made and making money. Oceans Twelve is a prime example of such a case. First of all, awful title.

Most of all, it was concise and concluded well. There was no need for a sequel. And there was definitely no need for a sequel with as little plot development that went into Oceans Twelve. The same cast returns, with the same, now tired gimmicks and personal neuroses. In Oceans Eleven, the crew rip off Mr. Benedict's money. This time around, even though the insurance company has paid Mr. Benedect what he lost in the robbery, for some reason he is intent on hunting down Danny's crew and getting the money back from him, with interest.

"There's a drop off from 2001's ""Ocean's Eleven.""","I was a bit disappointed in the sequel to 2001's ""Ocean's Eleven."" After watching the first movie, I could not imagine the characters finding themselves in the situations that they got themselves into in this movie. The movie (125 minutes) seemed to drag one a bit too much. Catherine Zeta-Jones' character seemed to be too much of the knowledgeable law person, surrounded by incompetents. To me, the most comical part of the storyline was when Bruce Willis made a cameo as himself. I am not a fan of Julia Roberts, but out of the few movies I've seen with her, her performance in this movie was my favorite (granted, I have not seen Erin Brockovich yet).",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Conceited Hollywood celebrities indulging in shameless self-idolizing,"This movie has a distinct amateuristic feel about it. It's very obvious the crew had too good a time touring through Europe, that they didn't bother to put much effort into the actual movie making.The best point was already made by katmarsen here on IMDb. This is a heist movie, but the actual heist involves stealing the backpack from some tourist on a train. I think that really illustrates how much effort went into the script of this so-called movie.The scene with the laser break dancing (with ""Nikkfurie - The a la Menthe"") would have worked well as a musicvideo on MTV.

Surprisingly bad movie!,"This is the worst movie I've ever watched, that's for sure. It is a bunch of huge Hollywood stars making a total disaster of a movie! It contains every element that makes up a bad movie: A confusing story that is getting worse and worse, actors with no chemistry between them, music that makes it all a cliché, random scenes that are hard to understand with actors that think they are great, embarrassing special effects, a little of this, a little of that and all of a sudden the movie ends! When the movie ended, all I could think about was the money I spent on it which was a huge mistake! I'm really surprised that stars like Zeta-Jones, Damon, Clooney chose to act in this movie. What a big mistake... They all deserve to be on anyone's sucks list after acting in this movie! The writer and director did their best to realise this mess.

"Jon Monsarrat review: OK, but they're not really trying","I enjoyed the first film, Ocean's Eleven, but the tension is gone from Ocean's Twelve. I think everyone's having too much fun with the self-parody and there isn't much thrill and danger in the film. There is a badguy who isn't really that bad. There is a love interest with no real chemistry. A good cop passes up a chance to do something good. It's unclear why Ocean's Twelve agrees to take on the movie's premise rather than just scattering to the winds and hiding. The ""funny"" bit with Julia Roberts struck me as self-absorbed as stupid.The plot is convoluted and hard to follow, especially as it is partly hidden from the audience for effect. And when the scheming is revealed it seems really unnecessary. This film reminds me of Gone In Sixty Seconds, and The Score, two heist films also lacking the important element of a heist film: tension!Who should see this film:-- You. With this many stars, you're going to see it anyway, I can't stop you. But remember I told you so when you don't like it. :)-- Cat burglars who are retired now, really.

It's Official... Ocean's Twelve Is The Worst Movie Of The Year!,"If I had to pick only one word to describe Ocean's Twelve, it would have to be TERRIBLE!To be perfectly honest, I wasn't expecting much from Ocean's Twelve, because I thought that the first one was dull and not that good. However, I had no idea that Ocean's Twelve would be this bad!Ocean's Twelve suffers from a weak and extremely confusing plot and gritty acting from a large cast. In addition, Ocean's Twelve is very slow and there is hardly any action in the entire film. There are ,at the very most, 2 action sequences throughout the movie.Ocean's Twelve is the worst film of the year, and it is the worst movie sequel ever made! DO NOT SEE THIS FILM EVER!

"As you might expect, the followup doesn't measure up","I'll open with what appears to be a cheap shot: Julia Roberts looked completely pale, frazzled, and worn out in this movie. She was looking a bit brittle and haggard in ""Ocean's 11"", and the trend is far more advanced here. I could be wrong, but I don't think this was a deliberate choice on the part of the filmmakers, I think she's just looking used-up, and they couldn't disguise it. It's hard to believe how far downhill she's gone (at least in the superficial cosmetic sense) since her 'Pretty Woman' days. Since she's always gotten by on her dewy good looks and coltish ingénue charm, I can only hope for her sake that she's just going through a temporary rough patch. Or that she starts going for dramatic 'character' roles (like Jessica Lange) instead of romantic lead parts. I think putting her in front of the camera looking like this and passing her off as a 'glamour queen' could kill her career. Good luck, Julia, hope things work better for you soon. Take a couple of months and spend a few of your millions at a good health spa/ranch retreat, OK?On to the real comments about the actual movie:To tell the truth, I liked ""Ocean's 11"" very much indeed...but I recognized that there was an elusive chemistry at work in the film, an inspired blend of clever plotting, cast chemistry, classy actors, cool jazz music and superb directorial timing and rhythm that might be hard to duplicate. So when I heard that a sequel was in the work, I wasn't sanguine about its chances for being up to the first one. But hey, ""X-Men 2"" was also a sequel involving a huge cast, and IT turned out great, so...I have to report that lightning didn't strike twice. ""Ocean's 12"", while reasonably watchable, has nowhere near the energy and fun of the original Soderbergh film.The thing about ""11"", was that it was essentially a fairy tale, a caper film where dashing, likable scoundrels went up against the odds and won the day by being slyer, smarter, and smoother under pressure than anyone could ever imagine...and lived happily ever after. Nearly every scene had our underdogs saying or doing something surprising, something delightful, something funny or hilarious, or being just plain cool.But the sequel takes a chance of going in a more realistic, downbeat direction. It shows our heroes not living so happily after all. It takes forever to get going and get the characters back together. It putzes around for several more scenes with no real forward progress after the basic dilemma has been established. It tests the viewers' patience with one false start after another as the bad guy from the first movie, the police, and a rival thief prove to be ahead of them at every turn. Instead of being delighted and dazzled by how cool they were, I was impatient for these guys to prove again what it was I liked about them the first time...and they just weren't doing it.And when the final plot twist is revealed, it turns out that most of the time our gang had things under control after all, but the viewer wasn't allowed to see the actual execution of the 'real' caper until the very end. In the first movie, Ocean's crew essentially kept pulling new stuff out of a seemingly bottomless bag of tricks...but they did it right in front of the audience. But in this case, the most important 'trick' is simply sloppy writing that cheats the audience. And BTW,it was a serious miscalculation to have Julia-Roberts-as-Tess her impersonate Julia-Roberts-the-celebrity part of a scam - it was a self-indulgent 'in-joke' that didn't work at all.In the message boards, one commenter astutely observed that, the real point of the the 2nd half of the movie was NOT to beat the rival art thief, it was to reunite Zeta-Jones' character with her father; once you realized this, some of the previous scenes made more sense. I'll buy that, but it doesn't change the fact that aside from a lingering shot of a back-pack sitting beside Pitt on a jet, and an inexplicable smirk on Pitt's face as he is led away in hand-cuffs, there is very little to clue the viewer about this development in the plot. The director and the screenwriter just didn't play fair.When you have this many talented actors together, something good is bound to leak through in spite of everything, and that is the case here. Some of the cast byplay is still fun and amusing. Zeta-Jones is a striking screen presence, and no time spent watching her on a movie screen is ever wasted. The rival art thief is the very embodiment of Continental cool and suaveness, and the sequence where he uses Capoeira to 'dance' through a laser maze is the visual highlight of the film (even if it seems like a shameless swipe from ""Entrapment"").And while I missed the swinging cool tunes of the first movies sound track, I felt that the more jagged, rough edged techno stuff playing this time around was quite compelling and added quite a bit to the movie.This might be one of those movies that improves with repeated viewings. (like the 1st ""Star Trek"" movie,""Kung Pow"", and ""Hellraiser IV""). Since I know where the highlights are, I can sit patiently through the dull and irritating spots since I know that a good bit is coming up soon. I hope so,anyway.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Dislocated + patchy + confusing = boring,"Highly recommended if you need to find something to put you to sleep. Editing was fractured, probably trying to give it an edgy, fast feeling, but succeeded only in confusing.No character development, interactions were completely superficial and about 8 of the 12 were completely incidental - just there to make up the numbers and had nothing to do with the plot.The inconvenient matter of loopholes and ""how did that happen"" was dealt with in the expedient manner of just jumping to the next scene when all is fine as if there never was a problem.Total result was disinterest and boredom. Couldn't care less about heroes or bad guys. And surely ""Europol"" have better things to do than devoting mega resources to tracking down people who steal some stuff from obscenely rich guys? Clever moment with Julia Roberts in a Robert Altman kind of thing, but not carried through with the same depth or class.Soundtrack was the best thing about the whole exercise - polished, inventive new music.Miss this movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
I had to rent a movie afterward....,"I wasn't satisfied after seeing it, so I ended up renting a movie that DID satisfy me. I found Ocean's Twelve's cinematography too be very jerky and ""unclean"".

I found it to be somewhat entertaining toward the end, but still, not as good as the first. I'd rather have just seen Ocean's Eleven again and be able to forget Ocean's Twelve came out. The plan just isn't as smart, and the camera work just isn't that great. Especially when they show a shot of every single character one by one, which is done at least three times. It's like they were adding it to kill time. A very wonderful cast, and director, but not a wonderful film.

A terrible reunion.,"With Ocean's 11 making a big splash a few years ago with mixed collage of Hollywoods's finest, a sequel like this was inevitable. But, as most sequel go, it looks very good on paper, a high demand but rarely captures the original and this reunion is no different.In Ocean's Reunion, Benedict finally finds the whereabouts of Ocean and his gang and gives them a two week deadline to come up with the money that was stolen (with interest.) While venturing to Europe to do some heists to pay off the debt, the gang finds out they have been set up by a rival thief in order to find out ""who's best."" Now it's race between Ocean and his crew and this thief going after the same prize, with the winner accepting the glory. Oh yeah, and if Ocean wins, the thief plans to pay Ocean's debt. No, I'm not making this up.Ocean's 11 was a great movie because it had great actors with good acting(OK, except Clooney), excellent plot which was simple yet intriguing, very good dialog and most of a all, a satisfying ending. Now, take that and minus everything that was good about it, except the actors and add Catherine Zeta-Jones and you have Ocean's Reunion.A had some major problems with Ocean's Reunion. Zeta-Jones's (who took a break from her T-Mobile commercials)was added in to play as a European detective tracking various thieves, more importantly she's shacking up with Pitt's character with them both of them playing a cat and mouse game throughout the the entire movie, because that's what the movie needed. Who knows, maybe I should give Sodenberg the benefit of the doubt and his script of ""Out of Sight"" somehow accidentally got mixed up with this one.The biggest problem I had with this reunion, besides the whole ""Thomas Crown Affair"" thing going on, was that Julia Robert's character, Tess, played Julias Roberts. Did you get that? In fact, the credits later on read: ""Introducing Tess as Julia Roberts."" What? In attempt to steal the prize Tess is brought in as Julia Roberts because Tess and Roberts kind of look alike, that's probably true because they're the same person. Then they topped off this calamity with a cameo of Bruce Willis who plays himself to spoil the gig. I was kind of shocked why Willis didn't recognize Matt Damon who played Linus because they were in the entire scene with him. Weird.With all sarcasm aside, this was way too drawn out taking forever for the plot to emerge. There were also to many plot twists (which seems to a prerequisite these days) which makes the movie hard to follow. The ending is terrible, comparing nothing like the original. The movie also centered more on Pitt, Jones and the unknown thief when the movie should've been focused on Garcia's anger and revenge, the fact he he lost 167 million dollars and his woman. In fact, Garcia's revenge is limited to only the first 10 minutes of the movie. It also should've contained some comedic scenes while the crew worked together, but that never happened neither. For a movie that spent four years in the making, this was seriously disappointing. The spent more time reliving the success if the first and drawing audiences than actually making a riveting plot. It's worth a rental and that's it.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime

I'm pretty sure none of the stars REALLY cared - after all, none of them had to carry the movie! It was like an NBA All-Star game without anything on the line. They probably did enjoy their European vacation, their relaxing getaway from the responsibilities of having to be The Man. (Or The Woman, in the case of Julia R.)And Soderbergh...

The plot, if there was one, was flimsy and I really got to the couldn't care less stage pretty early on. The second hour was somewhat better but it was still very disjointed with an awful lot remaining unclear.

"Something of a con trick by Soderbergh, but which will fool no one but the extremely gullible","Stephen Soderbergh is one of those directors - make that 'auteurs' - 'cineastes' revere. (A 'cineaste' is a man or woman, but invariably a man, who is 'passionate' about films and filmmaking. That's all you need to know about 'cineastes'.) Drop the name Soderbergh into many a conversation and you leave your mark as a man or a woman, but invariably a man, who is a cut above the hoi polloi in matters film. Sodebergh is one of a small, elite group of 'auteurs' who could fart on film and be acclaimed as 'left-field', 'original', 'daring' where you and I would be sent away with a flea in our ear for doing the same thing.I have by no means seen all of his films but I rather liked two - Sex, Lies And Videotapes, with which he made his name (on the strength of that film the saintly Roger Ebert described Soderbergh as 'the poster boy of the Sundance generation') and Side Effects, a more conventional film but an effective thriller. Unfortunately, Soderbergh's talents, for he undoubtedly has talent, often fail him and Ocean's Twelve is a case in point. (Incidentally, Soderbergh was either not aware what a self-indulgent hotch-potch of rubbish Ocean's Twelve became - which is unlikely - or he was but thought that given his reputation he could get away with it - for more likely.)I haven't seen Ocean's Eleven, Soderbergh's remake of the Rat Pack film, which I understand was rather good, not least because the plotting was tight, though the rule of thumb is 'if you're going to remake a film, you'd better have a very good reason for doing so' and as far as I know Sodernergh didn't have one for remaking Ocean's Eleven. As for this sequel, loose, not to say abysmally awful, plotting is one of many failures which reduce Ocean's Twelve to such a worthless piece of rubbish that you wonder why it didn't go straight to video. Actually, given the 'name actors' involved, not least George Clooney, Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt, there was no way they could even contemplate allowing it to go straight to video. Elsewhere in these pages a civilian reviewer has remarked that in the round of TV interviews launched to plug this film when it was first released, the cast was reduced to insisting what a real hoot they all had making it - never, ever a good sign. In the reviewers words the producers realised what a turkey they had on their hands and were engaged in campaign of damage limitation.The reason Ocean's Twelve was made is obvious: Ocean's Eleven made a shedload of money so the producers took to heart Sam Goldwyn's dictum 'if they liked it once, they'll love it twice' and decided to cash in. Well, they did - just (the budget was $110,000 million, it grossed £125,000 million - not a roaring success.)So that of the film itself? Well, it gets of to a reasonable start and the first 20 minutes more or less pass muster, although this viewer is getting a little tired of the old Hollywood schtick of 'getting the old gang together again for one last job'. If I've seen it once, I've seen it 1.000 and it doesn't change a great deal. But then the doubts mount. I don't mind being baffled a little if I feel safe in the knowledge that there is an intelligence at play here which will draw all the strands together in an honest and coherent way. But on this occasion I didn't. On this occasion I got the feeling that the inconsistencies weren't clever plot devices but because at the end of the day the director just couldn't be arsed. Roll on to the finale and that suspicion is confirmed: Soderbergh had reduced himself to the status of jobbing director getting a slice of that promised shedload of money. I shan't give a spoiler but the whole script seems to have been written on the hoof and given that finale the previous hour or so make absolutely no sense whatsoever and are an insult to the viewer.So, Stephen, a few arty camera angles - the shot of the plane arriving in Rome with the camera simply on its side is pure adolescence - and a pseudo cinema verite style of filming with the characters all talking at the same time with the camera behaving like a drunk at a party don't give you a get out of jail card: this is clunky filmmaking at its worst. My advice to all is: just don't bother.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
Your not making any sense!,"(Some spoilers) More like a private home movie then a major Hollywood studio made motion picture for the movie-going public ""Ocean's 12"" doesn't make any sense at all with these dozen or so international super crooks.The crooks are seen jet-setting all over the capitals of Europe in an attempt to steal up to 160 million dollars. This is all done in a number of elaborate heists to pay off big time US hoodlum and owner of the Bellaslo Casino, who these same crooks ripped off, Terry Benedict, Andy Garcia.As if he were all knowing and omnipresent Benedict pops up all over the country in the strangest of places to surprise all the hoods involved in the robbery of his casino some three years ago. Telling the former crooks that if they don't come up with his money plus interest within two weeks they'll be as dead and buried as last years turnip crop.We have the happy go lucky robbers led by Danny Ocean and Rusty Ryan,George Clooney & Brad Pitt, go to Amsterdam to begin their scavenger hunt for Benidict's stolen millions by stealing tens of millions from others. For some reason the USA was too dangerous for them even though they've live there with all their ill-gotten loot for the last three years without having any fear of being arrested by the police.In Amsterdam we soon learn the real reason for Benedict's unusual actions? Benedict seemed uninterested about getting his money back all these years but why all of a sudden is he now? This super-duper crook Francois Touolur,Vicent Cassel, also known as the ""Night Fox"" want's to pit his wits and robbing skills and abilities against the crack Ocean 12 crew. Touolur wants to prove to them that he's the biggest baddest and best crook of them all. We also learn that it was Touolur who tipped off Benedict on the Danny Ocean's crews whereabouts to get them to come out of hiding, or retirement, to meet his challenge.The film ""Ocean's 12"" get's more and more confusing as it goes along with hot-shot and pretty Interpole agent Isabel Lahiri, Catherine Zeta-Jones, joining in on the case and single-handedly screws it all up by being taking advantage of and then made to look like a jerk by Rusty & Co.

Twelve is definitely NOT the new Eleven,"First of all, let me make it clear that I really liked Ocean's Eleven. I liked the cleverness of the script, most of the characters involved (even Julia Roberts), and the crafty workmanship of the movie that left me with ""aha"" and ""wow"" at the end.So having said that, I really didn't like Ocean's Twelve at all. I got tired about half an hour into it, and I would have fallen asleep had I been sitting on my couch instead of a theater seat in the last 30 minutes. The plot was way too convoluted and unfocused that even after all of the explanation (quite a lengthy one at that), I was still confused. When later I thought about it more and got around to understanding it, I couldn't help but question why certain things had to be done in a certain way, and no answer I could come up with was good. That's when I became angry for paying $8 to watch the damn movie.Some movies you can predict the twist in the middle of it and still enjoy (as many movies do this). Some movies you have no idea what's going on, and still have no clue far afterwards but nevertheless enjoy (see Mulhallond Drive). This is a movie that does none of that, and in the end I really didn't care whether Ocean's Twelve became Ocean's Zero (and remember, I like these characters). And what I couldn't stand throughout the movie is the smugness that saturates the writing and direction, as if the cast was constantly reminding itself and letting the audience know that they are cool. It's like hearing an inside joke that you have no idea what it means, and then when you are let in on it, it's not really funny at all.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
The fun runs out before the movie does,"You will do your first double take at the very beginning of the movie when you find that the group that was portrayed as brilliant, gutsy sharpsters in Ocean's 11 falls to pieces at the demand that they repay the guy they robbed in the last movie. Say what?The lack of credibility might have been bridged by great acting or great chemistry but this movie has neither. It degenerates into a series of photo-ops of the beautiful people, strung together in a manner that is neither convincing, or for that matter, particularly entertaining.I was personally quite surprised at how good the modern Ocean's 11 was, considering that the original Ocean's 11 with Sinatra and the rat pack left some pretty big shoes to be filled. But Oceans 12 is a stereotyped sequel -- an attempt to capitalize on prior success on the cheap.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
Disappointed,That is really all I have to say about the movie. Disappointed. I was really looking forward to it because I really liked Ocean 11. I didn't like the way it was filmed (kind of edgy home movie filming) and the dialog was pretty flat. I didn't feel like they were a team working together but a lot of individual actors in a movie. Just didn't do anything for me. I ALSO think it is really important to refresh your memory and watch Ocean 11. It had been a while since I had seen the other one so I got lost a few times on who the people were.It did have a few good scenes that were funny and touching but on the most part it just didn't flow very well.,3.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Brilliant cast, why weren't they given a good script?","In Ocean's Eleven we saw George Clooney, Brad Pitt,Matt Damon etc etc pull off a classy casino heist. The film was engaging, exciting and most of all, likable. In Ocean's twelve, the whole gang are back, plus Catherine Z-J to pull off another heist. And the reason for this one (try not to laugh) is that they have to pay the money back they made in the first film, plus interest! This is one of the worst plots in recent memory and not only makes for a wasted two hours but totally depletes the excellence of the first film! The cast is one of the best ever assembled but are given nothing to work with. Soderbergh should have known better.This sequel to the remake of a classic Sinatra film should be avoided by all and forgotten by fans of the cinema. Sequels are currently being filmed to the remakes of the Thomas Crown Affair and The Italian Job. Lets just hope they are not as abysmal as Ocean's 12.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
Such a disappointment,"I was really looking forward to this movie because I had loved the first Ocean movie. The reviews I read on it all made it seem enjoyable if forgettable.While the first movie was fresh and funny, this movie was... lacking. It lacked plot, it lacked originality, it lacked good acting. It even lacked a steady camera man. While trying to make this movie seem fun and retro, they used a lot of tricks from 70's movies that are best forgotten. While trying to poke fun a recent ""Lost in translation"" they lost the audience. The entire movie lacked a point, in the end leave you wondering instead of satisfied.What was worse was I actually had to leave the theater about 5 minutes before the movie ended because the camera was so shaky, my stomach couldn't handle it anymore.Leave this movie on the shelf at the rental place. Instead, just watch Ocean's 11 again, or, even better, the original Ocean's 11 with the Ratpack!",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
sequence of mostly listless cameos and no thrill,"Summary says it all. Oh heck they want 10 lines here, hmm. Occasional nice scenery, photos of jets flying overhead in swivel/pan shots just like in the 60s. A few other nods to other films, like the laser dance Cassel does mocks Zeta-Jones in Entrapment. Actually, Cassel (or his stunt double) is consistently watchable, at least someone is having fun. Some of the cameos actually have some life, a few of the stars actually have enough dialog or action to occasionally show some chops. All the heists are boring. No use is made of the potential for suspense. In this case we won't need to worry about an unlucky 13, hopefully ""12"" ends this franchise.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
Ain't it awful,"I saw the remake of Oceans 11 some 3 years ago. Upon viewing the somewhat poorly written remake I thought to myself that this could not be any worse if they tried. Guess what ? They did an Oceans 12 !! I always try to watch a movie with an open mind and a positive attitude. About half way through the movie my attitude was no longer positive. For some reason the writers and producers of this group figured they had enough substance to do a sequel. WRONG !! Most of the characters are NOT likable. They try to make it interesting by constantly changing countries. They try to make it interesting with a plot that might be hard for most to follow. George Kloony and Brad Pitt are in the mix again to try and make things slick and flamboyant. No help. Matt Damen makes it worse with his character. The supporting cast has NO likable characters either. If you can see this at a friends house that is fine, but DON'T waste your money on this one folks. I doubt it did well at the box office for that matter. PLEASE, don't make a 13 !!",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
Convoluted to the point of ridiculousness...,"Ocean's Twelve isn't so much a movie as it is an opportunity for the majority of the actors involved to mirror their own predominant personal behavior: pretentiousness. The ""coolness"" of Ocean's Eleven, prevalently displayed in the previews for the movie, turned me off to it, but I saw it at a friend's after it was released on video and ended up liking it very much. This brand of ""coolness"" is irritating and confusing, and though the movie can be entertaining, there are far too many subplots for us to care (or most times understand) what is occurring. The major heist involved here is clever and the dialog can be very entertaining at times, but the majority of the movie still feels like a stranger's conversation in which we are just observers. The backstories of many events are shown after the scene in which it would be essential to comprehend, and while this may seem like an original cinematic twist, it just doesn't flow.Simply put, the movie has little of the original, tightly packed feel of Ocean's Eleven. Most everything goes wrong for the crew this time around, whereas they had an almost perfect heist in the first movie. It's an interesting switch, but it dramatically hurts the pace of the movie. I didn't dislike the movie as a whole, but I didn't particularly enjoy it either.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Do not become another victim of Ocean's horrible second movie.,"Alright, Ocean's Eleven was fun. A lot of money has been made with the original movie, a great and funny cast/team, an amazing heist, decent music and a few great action scenes. And then it went wrong. I'll never understand why Ocean's Eleven had to have a part 2. First off the lack of ideas becomes painfully clear with it's title. Then the lack of a script slowly starts to show off. The action scenes look familiar, I'd expect them in some B-movie, not in a digital masterpiece. I have been lucky, all I've been robbed from is a free evening as it was on TV, do not waste any money on this one, it contains all what can possibly go wrong with a movie full of top actors. Clooney got some lines forced down his throat that have probably been supposed to be funny. They weren't. The double role of Julia Roberts just makes this abomination of a movie even worse. This is a prime example of how to waste millions of dollars on total scheis.Plot: Some movies are better left alone. Part 2 kind of ruined part 1 for me.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Despite most reviewers on this site being retarded, they were right about Ocean's 12","Quite a few people have reviewed Ocean's Twelve on this site and I've noticed a few of the same things being said ad nauseum. Some girl from Australia commented on the director going with a ""new, popular shaky cam technique"" that she didn't quite agree with. Perhaps she was talking about hand-held camera shots which have only been a staple in the arsenal of DP's since...the invention of the film camera? I loved the cinematography of Ocean's twelve. When was the last time you can recall a movie using zoom? Not a dolly shot, not a tracking shot, but a straight-up zoom. It's campy and cheesy, but thats what they were going for. That, combined with a warm yet muted palette and a definitively euro-trash soundtrack, invoke a sense of nostalgia. If any of you have seen old school campy Italian films, you'll know what I'm talking about. To make an already long story short, what I'm trying to say is that this was an amazing -looking- film - one full of style. Unfortunately, the story is far too convoluted. There's a heist, but not really. Once you find out that there was actually a heist -before- that heist, you realize you're wrong. It's apparently all a master plan put into motion by some thief. If that sounds confusing, it is. I'm still not even sure whether or not that's what really happened, I'm only speculating. I still have a hard time figuring out which parts of the movie were real, and which were just facades enacted by thieves.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
What a disappointment,"My wife and I found the Oceans 11 remake entertaining. This evening we saw the sequel, which is called Oceans 12. This is hyped as a movie where the cast are all having a lot of fun and the audience experiences their fun. They must have been totally bored having this fun as it was one of the most boring films I have ever seen. And - to be honest - I generally can find SOMETHING redeeming in most films.My wife first said she didn't find it as boring as I said it was but then she admitted that she had spent a long time thinking about a meal at home for some guests in great detail. You don't do this if you find the film interesting.I saw Matt Damon on Leno (I think it was) and he made a comment about the ""all having fun"" thing. He said that Cannonball Run II was likely the film that the cast most enjoyed making. Implicit here was ""and what was that worth?""Leno kept referring to the film as an ""art house film"" and my impresion was that he meant that it was far from being one of these. But, now that I have seen it, I understand that he actually meant that the camera-work etc. do resemble what he might associate with that type of film.I think Damon and Leno might have been telling us what they actually thought about Oceans 12.I must admit that this film was worse than Cannonball Run II as the plot was total confusion and the film was made as if it were an early Danish ""Dogma"" film with intentionally shaky camera and bad lighting and awful sound.With such a ""star studded"" cast - you would expect that the villain was also someone ""worthy"" ie well known rather than the man who usually does the voice-over for Hugh Grant in French dubbed films.One little note about the ""surprise guest"". I really wonder how many of this film's target group know this elder actor.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
If you liked Oceans 11 don't see this film,"This movie tries to be twisty like the first (Oceans 11) but fails at every point. It jumps backs and forwards with dates and robberies that just bores you. Each part of the story is unbelievable and each robbery is replayed after the event, not in real time.There is no suspense in the movie. You get constant shots of Zeta-Jones in any number of outfits.The idea that a top museum has dancing laser beams as opposed to the more effective IR security of a normal house is just silly.The movie could end at any moment and it would be not be out of place, because there is no beginning middle or end. When it does end it is a relief.Trust me - don't watch it.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
Acid Reflux Film,"Wow, this is everybody's jigsaw puzzle bought with high hopes and best intentions and lost to other priorities. A piece here, a piece there, one star's schedule here, another's commitments there...what the viewer gets is a last minute pounded together mess of disjointed pieces that might once have fit (then again, maybe not) but which- time-a-wastin'- had to be pounded together and shoved to the public by a distribution deadline.What in the world is this movie ABOUT? I think the intention must have been to confuse the viewer and thus maintain mystery to the end. The confusion part stuck, the mystery was why on earth the movie was released. Zeta-Jones was a pretty growth attached for...well, who knows what for. The ""plot"" was like walking a maze and bumping your nose at every turn, not because of clever writing, but because confusion for its own sake is chaos. The script itself was undoubtedly written by a committee who each took a segment, forgot to check in with each other, and wrote something that involved characters who shared at least the same name.Ocean's Eleven had a tight, fast, understood plot. The surprises fit with the foundation of viewer understanding of what was going on. If that element of comprehension doesn't underly what is up on the screen, all you get is a jumble...all you get is ""Ocean's Twelve.""Isn't it just sad that Julia played Tess playing Julia? I was embarrassed. How much funnier if they had implied Tess looked like a movie star (could pull off a ""lookie-Loo"") and then dressed her up like Gweneth Paltrow. THAT would have been funny.Well, it all boils down to making the viewer feel stupid, or not ""with it"" because the darn movie doesn't make sense. I watched this turkey 3 times just to be fair, but I still didn't get the plot or the point. I am left with acid reflux...I just couldn't digest it.No harm done. I didn't pay box office prices, so I'm OK. My condolences to those of you who are no wiser and much poorer for experiencing ""Ocean's Twelve."" Let your comfort be in numbers; you are not alone.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
What a waste,"This movie looked like good fun in the trailers and ads. The 2001 movie was great fun, and the entire cast and director returned, it should have been great, unfortunately it wasn't.The problem with this movie is i don't think Steven Sodenbergh knew what to do with so many stars, and how to continue the story that finished off nicely at the end of the first film. Instead of a clever script we get 2 hours of cameos, in-jokes, George Clooney and Brad Pitt smirking, some impossible to follow story about cat burglars and interpol, and beautiful shots of Europe ruined by an overuse of hand-held camera, and a god awful sequence about Julia Roberts worshiping her own celebrity status.It may have been fun for the cast and crew, but not for the audience",4.0,Anonymous,Crime

A Movie Made For Its Own Stars,"Ocean's Twelve decidedly falls under the ""not as good as the original"" category, but this sequel was not without its own charm.Acceptable, entertaining performances were turned in by the film's all-star cast. However, I felt that the entire movie was made FOR the film's stars. For example, if I were Julia Roberts (well, I wouldn't be writing this review right now) and I watched the film, I would love it - because it's filled with inside jokes and industry jokes that I personally find funny and probably helped craft. However, as the everyday audience member, the movie comes off as a little too eager to please its own people and not eager enough in being a great sequel.With all that said, I think if you are a fan of the cast (because they do have arguably great on-screen chemistry), you will like Ocean's Twelve all the same. I had that one major problem with the movie, but I was definitely still entertained. Ladies (or gentlemen), the French guy was hot (or maybe not, I saw it when it came out in theaters and it's been awhile).If you were a fan of the first movie and its cast - Ocean's Twelve is worth checking out - it won't be a total waste of time.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Ocean's Bottom,"The whole team pretty much just called it in on this sequel to Ocean's 11, which had its own issues. The movie seemed fake and nobody wanted to be there.

Time to move on. I don't recommend this movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
