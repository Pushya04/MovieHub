Not to be taken seriously...,"Set some 200 years after the events of Alien 3, Alien Resurrection follows a group of scientists who are desperate to get their hands on some aliens to study. They achieve this (questionably, I might add) by obtaining some DNA from the long dead Ellen Ripley, and cloning her. Eventually they are successful, and extract the alien queen she had in her chest (hmmm) and begin their research. Thing is, the DNA has become slightly muddled, meaning the aliens now have some human traits along with a more organic appearance, and Ripley is... not quite herself. A band of mercenaries drop off some 'test subjects' for the scientists to impregnate, and all hell breaks loose. The aliens are much smarter now, so escape with ease and run amok, but Ripley is now super strong and has acid for blood. Together, she and the mercs must stop the aliens reaching Earth...Sounds awful doesn't it? And many fans of the series think it is. I can see why, the aliens don't quite look right, the camera work is, well, very late 90s... and the characters are so ridiculous I'm not quite sure if the film is intentional parody. The film isn't tense or scary in the slightest, and the final act is pretty much complete garbage. The thing is despite its many many flaws, it is quite fun once you accept it for what it is - a fun and goofy sci fi action film that is not to be taken seriously. You will know if this appeals or not...",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Flawed yet underrated fourth installment in one of sci-fi's most notorious franchises,"Alien:Resurrection divided audiences from the day it got released in theatres. To this day, even many studio execs and producers of the earlier films don't even dare watch this film or even consider it as part of the Alien franchise (so glad the Alien anthology Blu-Ray Boxset includes making-of featurettes for each of the four films - pretty awesome stuff). Among the franchise's fanbase, it's not unanimously appreciated either. I can understand why.Nonetheless, I still think it deserves to be watched, as despite its weaknesses, Jean-Pierre Jeunet's film offers its share of interesting moments, all wrapped up in a technically-sound package.Now, for anyone who has seen all four films, it's pretty obvious that each one of them has its own respective flavour, so to speak. Each film comes from a different director (and all four directors are extremely talented guys), and the difference in tone is quite noticeable, as the first film is a true, nightmarish, slow-paced sci-fi horror film ; Aliens is more action-oriented ; Alien 3 is a blend of thriller and horror film. Alien:Resurrection is no rupture to this thread of changing tones, as it has its share of dark humor, it's far more gory and graphic than all the previous installments, and it picks up (only) 200 years after Alien 3, in a spaceship, with our favourite monster-slaying female protagonist, none other than Ellen Ripley. Yes, she died in the third film, but writers have found an unoriginal and somewhat far-fetched way of bringing her back, which surprisingly ends up being perhaps one of the most interesting subplots in the whole movie (and one of the only ones too), as it leads to one pretty haunting scene later at the mid- point of the feature.The script certainly isn't the film's strongest asset, as it serves no purpose other than getting the spaceship crew to confront the notorious alien creatures through all areas of the spaceship, with plenty of bloody and gooey fun throughout. My synopsis might not do the script justice, as there are a few subplots that I will not spoil, some interesting, some just plain silly. It does borrow elements from the previous films: Ripley develops a relationship with one of the characters that's a bit reminiscent of that she had with Newt in Aliens; there is a lot of action and gun play, just like there was in Aliens; it follows the tradition of featuring a robot character; the crew of the spaceship is composed of a few macho characters that might remind you of those in Alien 3, etc. All these elements are nice inclusions, but have a tribute feel to them more than anything else.Anyhow, we do get good performances from the likes of Ron Pearlman, Brad Dourif, Wynona Ryder, Dominique Pinon and, of course, Sigourney Weaver.Directing and cinematography rank among the highlights, along with the tremendous makeup and practical effects. Jean-Pierre Jeunet definitely brings a humorous touch here and there, but it never amounts to any overly distracting silliness. The aesthetics are true to the genre and look better in this film than in any of the previous ones, especially the creatures. They're more fluid in movement, the costumes are very detailed and gorgeously textured, and some of the set-pieces bring the gooey madness to a whole new level. Cinematography has a distinct feel to it, and the work on lighting is somewhat reminiscent of that in La cit√© des enfants perdus and Delicatessen, two of Jeunet's previous films.The soundtrack by John Frizzell also works very well, and adds a nightmarishly majestic tone to the film, especially in those moments featuring plenty of organic imagery.Overall, Alien:Resurrection, despite its fundamental flaw of suffering from a linear and quite predictable script that might borrow too much from the previous outings, is still a welcome (yet maybe unnecessary) addition to the franchise, and a technically competent film which profits greatly from Jean-Pierre Jeunet's approach in visual storytelling. While it is not nearly as good as either one of the first two films, it's still a worthwhile 100 minutes in the Alien universe.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Many flaws, yet so many memorable moments","It is strange, that movie this bad is so memorable and awesome :DEvery other line of script consists loud shouting with close up so the head takes at least 60% of the screen. It is maybe the reason this movie is a walking meme.It's a horror movie that has given horror theme and basically there are no surprises. You can surprise somebody from behind only couple of times before it gets old. Sometimes the one walking up front gets it, sometimes the one guardian the rear. And this movie does this kinda well, it plays it for its audience.I liked it. Even back then, still even now. After seeing Alien 2 as a kid, i had nightmares as it was seriously scary movie. But then the A3 + this cured me forever as it does not take itself that seriously. On one hand it's a shame, but on the other hand it's good to have some different take on the same universe.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"In space, no one can hear you sigh","Alien Resurrection is the most radical departure in the series that has now spanned centuries in its own universe and nearly twenty years of our own earth time.  Gone is the meticulously constructed suspense of Ridley Scott's 1979 original.  Gone is the heart-stopping pulse of uncannily staged action from James Cameron's 1986 sequel.  Gone is the Ripley who cried and fought and bled and sacrificed her own life to save the world from the horror she very nearly unleashed in David Fincher's atmospheric and underrated Alien 3. Instead, we get the all-new Ripley: cynical, sardonic, and ready with a wisecrack or a fist for anyone who crosses her path.  Director Jeunet unfortunately seems to bask in self-parody, and this is where the film goes wrong.  He serves up plenty of nasty evisceration and gruesome chest-bursting, but by now we have seen so much of the creatures that they are no longer terrifying.  Still, I have a lasting affection and fascination with this series -- and Jeunet Alien is better than no Alien.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Alien=suspense, Aliens=action, Alien&sup3;=tragedy, Alien Resurrection=gore","Although it's got major flaws and some plot holes, I find myself liking Alien Resurrection a lot. First of all, I'm a sucker for horror and sci-fi movies. Second, I LOVE the Alien series, although Alien&sup3; was a bit offbeat in the action department. Third, Sigourney Weaver is incredibly menacing as a cloned Ripley. She's always great to see on screen but this was truly something to behold. and last but not least, I loved the storyline, how they brought the genetic aspect so cleverly. It was truly a new twist on the series, although I wouldn't qualify A:R as a REAL episode in the Alien series but rather a new begining. Jean-Pierre Jeunet did a great job in bringing his fantastic style to Hollywood. The creatures were cool and scary although I wish we had seen more of the Queen; we still had the horrific Newborn which was truly demonic. Anyway, despite it's flaws, it's still a great film, although it will never be a classic like Alien and Aliens are. Now if only there could be a fifth one with a better script, more character development and more firepower.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Fatal Mistake.,"Review 4 of 4With Alien 3 closing the story arc of the Alien trilogy, this film begins with a fresh slate. The Alien films have always been a director's series but in this film it was the writing that ultimately killed it. Resurrection tries to be too many things at once. It has a very artistic and dynamic visual style, but cardboard characters. It has a very overt sense of humor, but it is all done in a very juvenile manner. Much of the maturity and restraint of the previous three films is thrown out in favor of a more comic book style. The cinematography and set design is gorgeous to the point of decadence. Sigourney Weaver has been given an interesting character to play and does it with a strange sense of detachment that lends more depth to the proceedings than the script ever could. Thinking back, the first three films all had very solid overall stories and well developed characters while Resurrection has a very solid concept but can't seem to build a coherent movie around it. If you follow the overall themes of the series with the first, second and third being birth, life, and death respectively that leaves Resurrection on shaky thematic ground. Since this is Alien: RESURRECTION obviously the filmmakers wished for rebirth to be the theme, but somehow it never quite works. The characters are basically action movie clich√©s, and the action sequences of the movie are hopelessly contrived. Why does the Alien always stop to snarl before it attacks giving people just enough time to shoot it? Alien 3 did not have this problem and it reinforced how dangerous the creature really was. Resurrection turns the Aliens into monsters from a B-movie. Very few scenes in the film are particularly memorable. Sure, the underwater chase is a nice bit of action derring-do, but there's no real sense of danger...except for the supporting characters you barely know who get killed in the reverse order they appear in the credits. Two fantastic scenes that I wish there were more of in the film are the doctor's examination of the Aliens where he ""plays"" with them. Now that was a scene of inspired genius. The other scene was when Ripley wakes up in her circular chamber. It is interesting to note that neither of these scenes have any dialogue, because the dialogue is pretty atrocious. Ron Pearlman is always fun to watch and makes a good comic duo with Dominique Pinon, but Winona Ryder absolutely kills this movie with her nonperformance. The effects look less realistic this time out and the score at times seems to try too hard to emulate the second and third films with Goldsmith's original Alien theme being used on several occasions. The film is a brilliant exercise in dynamic visuals but the story really does not go anywhere. Unlike the first three films this one does not take itself seriously at all so the danger level becomes nonexistent. I believe Jean-Pierre Jeunet was an excellent choice for a director but the script served him very badly. This is an interesting film to watch for an interesting scene here and there but not in the same league as the previous films.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Alien: Resurrection""- A fun big-budget 'B-Movie.' Trite and a bit mindless, but ferociously entertaining!","One of the longest running modern day horror franchises, ""Alien"" is a fascinating beast in the world of entertainment and media. With its humble origins as a quiet, slow-burn sci-fi thriller, the series evolved through sequels and spin-offs into something else entirely. Whether it be through James Cameron's exquisite action-extravaganza ""Aliens"", or the Paul W.S. Anderson schlock-tastic crossover ""AVP: Alien VS Predator"", or even series co-creator Ridley Scott's own pseudo- philosophical quasi-prequel ""Prometheus""... ""Alien"" has changed and evolved quite a bit over the past forty years.But one release in particular has attracted an almost unanimous scorn and unending ridicule from all over the fanbase. A film that's so reviled, it's almost become a prerequisite that you're just expected to hate it. That being 1997's ""Alien: Resurrection""- a strange little footnote in the series that tries its hardest but never quite comes together into much of anything. An attempt to turn the series around after the mixed reception garnered by ""Alien 3"", this fourth film aims for the stars, but stumbles and falls flat on its face. Although, if I am to be completely honest... I actually don't mind it too much. It's silly, but quite amusing and thrilling, with stylish visual direction and plenty of laughs and thrills to go around. Yes, ""Resurrection"" might be a mindless and trite exercise in style over substance... but it's also bold and extraordinarily entertaining. It's a ton of fun, even if it is objectively a ""bad movie.""Two-hundred years after the events of the previous film, scientists working for the military successfully clone Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and the queen embryo she had been impregnated with, intent on allowing the alien life-form to reproduce so that they might study its race. This ""new"" Ripley has retained some faint memories of her former life thanks to genetic memory, but as a result of the cloning process, has also taken on some characteristics of the dreaded ""xenomorph"" species. When the offspring of the alien queen manage to escape, however, Ripley is forced to team up with a group of mercenary space-pirates (including Ron Perlman, Winona Ryder) in order to escape. Along the way, she will uncover startling and deadly revelations about the project that brought her back to life, and come face to face with a devilish new threat...Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet from a script by the world-renowned geek-god Joss Whedon, ""Resurrection"" does so much right that it's frankly a shame it's so routinely dismissed without much thought. It's essentially an incredibly slick and exceedingly well-made crappy B-movie. The plot is ridiculous. The characters silly and archetypal. And it's filled to burst with nonstop gore and effects. But it's made with a massive budget, an A-list cast and comes from a wildly talented director with a clear vision. Even on a pure aesthetic level, it's one of the most striking films of the franchise, with Jeunet's wonderful eye for flow and composition delivering many incredible set-pieces and designs that'll stick with you. It's just a gorgeous film all around.The cast is an absolute blast, with Weaver once again knocking it out of the park. Especially as this ""new"" Ripley also goes through some fascinating changes that both allow Weaver to stretch her acting chops... and have some fun chewing the scenery from time to time. Perlman and Ryder are good fun as members of a space-pirate team, with Perlman in particular being a good fit for the franchise. He's a criminally underrated performer and it's a joy seeing him on- screen. We also get small but fun turns from the likes of Brad Dourif, Dan Hedaya and Michael Wincott, and all serve the film quite well. The effects and action are top-notch for the time, with many sequences still holding up quite well to this day. An underwater chase-scene and a trippy climactic battle against a potential new threat in particular being eye-popping and absolutely jaw-dropping. And the wonderful cinematography and almost amniotic musical score add much to every single scene.But yeah... despite that praise, the film does have a lot of problems. Like I said above- it's basically a big-budget B-movie filled with the tropes and archetypes you'd expect, and it doesn't fit in with the rest of the series quite well. Unless you're willing to forgive a lot and go with the flow, you're not gonna have a good time with ""Resurrection."" There has been a lot of talk of how Whedon disowned the film and felt his script wasn't translated properly to screen, and I could definitely see shades of that. For all the amazing things he does, Jeunet seems less interested with story and more interested in increasingly psychotic visuals. And if you're looking for anything more than surface-level entertainment, you'll be sadly let-down.But me? I take movies for what they are and what they aspire to be. It's clear everyone involved on-screen is having a lot of fun. It's clear that Jeunet is trying to build a wild thrill-ride of a monster-movie. And it's clear that this is a film more concerned with crazed displays of gore and effects than a cohesive story. And you know what? I had a lot of fun with it. It's technically a ""bad"" movie, but to me... it's a FUN bad movie. And I'm giving it slightly above average 6 out of 10. Give it another shot with an open mind. It just might surprise you how enjoyable ""Alien: Resurrection"" really is.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Hey, Ripley. I heard you, like, ran into these things before?""","I actually read the novel before I had ever seen the feature, and I really enjoyed it. As I remembered being on holidays with my family soon after it just opened at cinemas and grabbing a copy to fill in the time. The aspect I liked about it was that the fact you could read that of the thoughts of the aliens. Sure it wouldn't work on film (well it might --- however it would feel quite odd to tell the truth), but it was an interesting touch in the book. I seen it a couple times now and it remains just as adrenaline pumped and enjoyably over-the-top entertainment.Anyhow French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet and writer Josh Whedon (best known for penning ""Buffy: The Vampire Slayer"" TV series and than later on the TV show and movie ""Firefly"") would definitely change the tone of the franchise with this well-budgeted sequel ""Alien Resurrection"" as its broodingly surreal visual edge and venomous tongue-in-cheek approach were the signature styles of its creators. Was it better for it¬Ö well, yes and no. While for me it doesn't come close to the first two films, I believe it to be an improvement over David Fincher's ""Alien 3"". Which I don't believe to be as bad as many make it out to be, but still a disappointing experience (although the producer's cut fixes up some problems evident in the theatrical release).Whedon's story is a perfect blend of sci-fi/ horror / action that starts off with an interesting vision, before transcending into the same old formula. Nonetheless director Jeunet's clinical, but streamlined handling constructs some twisted images (like that of the newborn alien) and exciting passages outside the graphic jolts, liked the sequences staged underwater and involving some ladder climbing. The atmosphere is dark and shadowy with vast, open long wide photography and an expansively simmering score.Special effects remain impressive as ever. Mixing with effective puppet work (how can you forget the second tongue and constant drooling!) and decent CGI work. The competent make-up FX stands up with moments of graphic carnage and new creation or two. The ensemble cast do decent job. Ron Pealman pretty much steals the show and Sigourney Weaver seems to be relishing her return. Winona Ryder is okay. Then there's solid support by Michael Wincott, J.E. Freeman, Dan Hedaya, Gary Dourdan and Brad Dourif.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Was it everything you hoped for?""","Alien Resurrection was released about six months after I graduated from high school, and at the time I wasn't very familiar with the series. I took my first film class about six months later, at which point I learned to really appreciate the great films and filmmakers, and one of the first things I learned was that the first three Alien films are spectacular achievements of science fiction cinema and the third sequel is a sad, ridiculous mess. This happens all too often with sequels and yes, part four is not yet another amazingly impressive Alien film, but come on, it's not THAT bad.I watched it last night for the first time in almost ten years, and was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. It's strange that I liked it so much, because it shows all the signs of a botched, modernized sequel of a series that should have been left alone long ago. The characters, most of all, are almost all goofy caricatures with preposterous dialogue and routine motivations, and some just don't belong at all. Personally I am a pretty big fan of Winona Ryder, but only in roles that suit her, and she has had a lengthy list of roles that suit her, but Annallee Call in Alien Resurrection is just not one of them. Too often she comes off as a tough talking teenager in this movie and it just gets hard to take her character seriously. She's like Ja Rule in Half Past Dead, but less ridiculous.Then again, this could just have been a result of her starring alongside Sigourney Weaver, and that woman is just awesome. Dan Hedaya is suitably over-the-top in his role as the gleefully neurotic General Perez, and I have to admit that I was curious to see the performance of Gary Dourdan as Christie. Lately I've been watching countless hours of CSI on DVD, and it's amazing to see how different his role is in this movie from the most serious role he would play later in that show. I prefer the later performance, myself.The resurrection implied in the title refers to Ripley being borough back to life 200 years after her death for the purpose of creating one of the alien queens, and then breeding the animals for twisted scientific purposes. They decide to keep Ripley alive for observation after surgically removing the alien from her chest, only to discover that she and the aliens are clearly more than they are prepared to handle. There is a negligible subplot involving a group of shady characters headed by the wonderfully sinister Michael Wincott as a Frank Elgyn, who promises his men won't start trouble or get into any fights if they are allowed to stay on board for a few days and nights.I also have to mention Ron Perlman, who just has a face for this kind of movie. Probably most recognizable lately as Hellboy, this has to be one of the least appreciated actors of the last few decades. In just over 20 years he has acted in more than 150 films and TV shows, and at the time of this writing he has 18 projects in the works. Unbelievable! He also has one of the best lines in the movie (""Why the waste of ammo?! Must be a chick thing¬Ö"").The aliens are probably the thing that will make or break this movie, and in my opinion they were impressive enough. The occasional CGI effects are never convincing, but then again they never are, so luckily they didn't overdo them. Even the aliens swimming underwater was not too much for me to accept, perhaps given the automatic tension that is immediately generated in almost any movie where someone has to hold their breath for a long time. This went on far too long to be anything remotely realistic in this movie, but it was a good scene nonetheless.I would also argue that this is the goriest of all of the four alien movies, particularly at the end, but also contains some of the best comic relief. This combination makes the movie highly entertaining, even following in the long shadows of its spectacular predecessors. There is a high energy scene in the third act of the film where Perlman's character performs a daredevil stunt to shoot one of the pursuing aliens dead which is followed by what has to be the funniest spider killing in film history. I haven't laughed out loud like that at a movie in a long, long time.In browsing through the posts on the message board for Resurrection I have been inspired to raise my rating for the movie from a 7 to an 8, if only because it is so obvious that everyone is jumping on the bandwagon about bashing this movie. I see nothing but whiny, pouting little brats whimpering and griping about little nitpicky details in the movie, condemning the third sequel in the Alien quadrilogy as a travesty and an embarrassment and a pathetic way to end the series.Stupid people in large numbers, man. It's sad to see such a clear mob mentality slamming a movie that is about 100 times better than most people say. No, it's not up to the same level as the first two films and it definitely has its drawbacks, but it is definitely a good installment in the series, and you could certainly do a lot worse for some fun popcorn sci-fi on a Friday night. I'll admit that my judgment might be a little skewed because I watched the staggeringly awful Eaten Alive just before seeing this, but it is clear to me that Alien: Resurrection has yet to receive the respect it deserves.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
It might disappoint you and here's why...,"The first three Alien films have a unique kind of ""magic"" about them that I think make up the ideal Alien experience.It is the ""ALIEN"" atmosphere: The first three films depict a very real world around a mysterious and terrifying ALIEN creature that you feared along with the well developed characters.Alien Resurrection has a very different flavor. Although it has some serious moments, there are several areas of this film that are out-of-place in both the film and the saga: Alien Resurrection has a number of humorous scenes which I feel take away from the above described overall ALIEN experience. The director goes straight into the action very quickly in this film so the only well developed character is Ripley. I think that the Alien creature loses a lot of its majesty in this film mostly because of these two critical factors.It is still a must-see film for any Alien fan. It is full of strong cinematic sequences that resonate in your head long after the film is over.But go in expecting something different.Enjoy!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

A 20 year re-review,"I am one of those older (mature) reviewers who can claim to have seen this series in real time, in theatres.First I will share my recollection of what that was like at the time.Alien 1 was magnificent. If you were to make a list of the greatest films of all time (and all reviewers do this, if only subconsciously) Alien 1 would be make the list. Alien 2 was doubly astonishing because it was almost as good as Alien 1 and, as any film buff knows, the sequel is rarely if ever that good.Expectations were high going into Alien 3, the prison planet movie, but the entry was disappointing and for the first time fans started to wonder if the franchise was going to self-destruct.For this reason, Alien 4, Resurrection, was disappointing in every possible way. It was a weak concept, poorly timed and poorly executed. The template for the story was more ""haunted house"" than sci-fi. Not only was the story flawed but at the end of the day it ran out of steam after the first 30 minutes and became tedious for the audience, a sin no film should ever commit. All the characters were so unlikable -- including to a large extent Weaver's saucy clone -- that even if the audience WANTED to root for a character, there was no one worthy of the effort.I got hold of the director's cut and re-reviewed this film because another member posted a review saying this film was unappreciated.OK, so let's appreciate it for what it is -- a flawed entry that almost destroyed the franchise. The IMDb rating is solid -- in other words, this is really a very weak film.(To date Alien 1 and 2 remain the best of the series. AVP is a remarkably perky little entry that somehow manages to polarize reviewers who either love it or hate. I have re-watched AVP more than any other entry. It is not elegant but it is very very entertaining.)",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not bad,"The fourth installment in the Alien Franchise was Alien Resurrection which had Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), cloned after she died 200 years ago in Alien 3. The cloned Ripley had in her, the DNA of the Alien so what they company had ""CLONED"" was a hybrid, a human and the alien DNA mixed.The new Ripley had in her chest the Queen Embryo, which was removed as soon as the cloning process was a success, and she was studied and she bred a new kind of Alien.Well, the company also had Alien eggs and they captured men in hyper-sleep and used them to breed the Alien. They caged them and tried to train them but soon the Aliens got smart and broke free and again all hell broke loose.What makes this last installment to the franchise good was the suspense, in every turn there is something you thought you had figured out till it changes the next second making the story also dynamic. Written by Joss Whedon, who had worked on Buffy the Vampire slayer before this, the story and screenplay had enough action to keep you on the edge of your sit.The actors were on their toes delivering their lines and their interpretation of character with finesse. Another thing that did it for me was the idea to use the Alien's blood as part of the script, not much about this acid blood has occurred in the previous two installments. But here it played a vital role in the story.It was also directed by another director, a French director Jean-Pierre who I have to give kudos to, as he did a fine job in delivery. The CGI and the effects in this installment was better than all previous 3 put together, and it has to be said even though this is not better than 2 (Aliens (1986)), it redeemed the image of the franchise.All in all, it is not a bad re watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Awful Movie, waste of time","I had high hopes for ""Alien Resurrection"" when I saw it last summer, since I think nearly everyone feels the third movie was a weak entry.  I was both revulsed and turned off by AR, and when I saw it again on cable recently my feelings were only confirmed.The original Alien was one of the first movies that used the ""doom and gloom"" view of the future to good effect.  Everything's dark and murky, spaceships look more like industrial waste yards, and the view of people and society is cynical.  The first few times you see it that approach is different or interesting, but now it seems every aspiring sci-fi movie uses it.  Will somebody please turn on the lights?The makes of AR forgot one key element of making this approach work is giving someone for the audience to care about.  Ripley's dead, now we have a cloned half human hybrid who spouts wonderful lines like ""Who do I have to f$%! to get off this ship?"", a gang of smugglers who kidnapped colonists to use as hosts for the aliens, and a bunch of soldiers and scientists on ""the other"" side.  The only person in the entire movie who I cared lived or died was the poor infested colonist who ended up getting blown away as the alien was about to burst out of his chest.Sigourney Weaver overdoes her creepy hybrid human but, let's just say you can tell she was the executive producer. Dan Hedaya I honestly thought was playing his part for laughs, which jarred in an otherwise gloomy movie.Lots of running around and shooting, with the heroes using weapons that looked like they were cobbled together from spare plumber's pipe. It got to the point I wondered what color blood/entrails would be splashed across the screen next as people and aliens died in various creative ways.The ""final showdown"" with the newborn alien, who is supposed to be a hybrid that's more alien, was ridiculous and incredibly revolting.  Did we really have to see every detail of it being sucked out a hole into space?I've heard they're committed to making a fifth movie, after this entry I certainly hope not.  They can keep cranking out Star Trek movies until the end of time, but I think this series is dead",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better as time goes,"I am probably biased, OK not probably... I am, but this film was better when you see the directors cut as part of the Alien Quadrilogy, with half-assed special effects and all. Is it a classic, well no it it is not, but compared to all the crap that came out in 2005, well yeah it could be considered a decent film. I am willing to be that Joss, (Whedon that is who wrote the screenplay I believe) has had many more ideas of what else he could have changed and/or added since he wrote this many years ago. All in all if you are a fan of what Ridley Scott's original 1979 ""Alien"" was or James Cameron's ""Aliens"" and even David Fichners ""Alien 3"" you will enjoy this film. I know myself and others would go and watch every single ""Alien"" film even if they made 50 of them. Sigourney seemed to kind of phoned this one in as well as Winona, (even though Winona really seemed to try, she was just not suited and or believable in her role.) The main problem to me seemed that there were way too many throw-away characters. Granted in a film like this we know that most of them are not going to make it, but it just seemed like they weren't trying to give any sort of personality at all. I have seen much worse and all in all this is not a bad film, hell the whole mutant ""Ripley"" lab thing as been made fun of and teased to death, so obviously people enjoyed parts of this film at the very least! If the ever do make a 5th film, it needs to be focused more on the ""Aliens"" and have very little to do with Ripley's character, if at all. If you love the original, at least see the sequels, (especially the sequel ""Aliens"") so you know what else is left in this franchise so it can be possibly resurrected. It is looking less and less likely now that it has been almost 10 years since the last film. I just hope that this isn't abandoned because there are so many more stories that we have not explored yet. But when in doubt thank the original director Ridley for welcoming us to a new type of film and has had a bunch of copycats since, but no one can come close to this original.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Terribly underrated,"This movie is terribly underrated. It is a common opinion that ""Resurrection"" buried ""Alien"" franchise, but I really cannot see any reasons for it. The movie has a different approach than its prequels, but in 20 years movie industry changed so much and it would be sad if it was the same. Honestly, although I think it is slightly worse than two previous sequels, I still prefer it to the original ""Alien"".7,5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Sad, sad ending(?) to such a good movie series","Well, what can I say about this one? It has totally lost whatever it was that made the other movies good. Sure, they have all been a little worse then the one before, starting With the excelent Alien, followed by the almost excelent aliens and then the okay movie Alien3. But this, is a total letdown. In my opinion there is no reason to see this one. Actually, if you've seen the others, it's even more reason to skip this one as it takes some of the ""glow"" from the others by bringing down the franchise.It's not so strange though... The best movies seldom benefit from a followup. (There are exceptions though)So, don't see this movie unless you feel you have to. You are likely to be very, very disapointed.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Although most would view it as an attempt to revive what is called an already dead series, it is actually a great movie with true intrigue and innovation.","First off, let me say that I LOVE the Alien series, so please acknowledge that.  Here's what I think:  The first two Alien films were outstanding. The first is the scariest movie of all time, and the second is the best action film of all time.  I think the third was okay, because it did achieve the dark and creepy feel it was going for, but was also a bit of a disappointment.  What I think everyone didn't acknowledge about the film was the fact that it did a damn good job of resurrecting the aliens.  Think about it.  How else can you make a story that takes place after the third one and still star Sigourney Weaver?  Don't say to say the third one was a dream, because then that would be corny and immature.  I thought that the story was very good.  The characters, although slightly wooden, were very well drawn.  Several people say that the old Ripley was gone, but by the end of the film, she was acting just like the good ol' gal we all know and love. And something that only one critic acknowledged was this:  the newborn alien.  WOW!  That thing was ugly and scary as hell!  That's the type of alien you need for the ending.  You've been seeing the same old alien for 3.75 films now, and you've pretty much gotten scared by the creatures as much as you could, why not bring some fresh meat on the scene?  And plus, you have to include the alien tradition of battling a new alien at the end of each film.  In the first one, Ripley battled a normal alien.  In the second one, Ripley battled a queen.  And in the third one, Ripley battled a dog alien.  To continue the tradition, Ripley battled a human alien.  And if I may say, that thing is the scariest of them all.  What I don't understand is that everyone says that this series ran out of steam by the beginning of the third one.  I disagree.  The Alien films still have a flare going, but a fifth one would be all that you could have before the flame burns out.  I expect the fifth to be REALLY good, but also tie up the entire story and give an accurate epilogue to the series.  And think about this:  You're not going to resurrect a series like this just so that you can end the series again just before the credits of the said film.  Alien Resurrection was a good movie, and I think that it was as innovative as a third Alien sequel could be.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't think of it as an Alien film,"Don't think of Alien Resurrection as an Alien film, but rather a Joss Whedon film. Yes it's different. But the others are separate types of movies also. Alien is a creepy monster thriller. Aliens is an action movie. Alien3 is a goth nightmare gone wrong. Alien Resurrection is a Whedon film. Me being a big fan of Firefly/Serenity and his Astonishing X-Men comic book series loved this film dearly. Yes it may require some thinking to understand, due to the cloning and cross-breeding stuff. But it isn't bad to have Hollywood make you think with an action/horror movie. If you think of this a different kind of movie I think you'll enjoy it like I did.

One of the worst films I've ever seen,"Alien Resurrection is more than just a bad installment to the Alien franchise. It is a horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE film from top to bottom. The script, the effects, the cast, and especially the acting are all unbelievably bad.The script: The whole concept is contrived, disjointed, and completely 'deux ex machina'. Bringing Ripley back from the dead via cloning, even 350 years in the future, is ridiculous. She wouldn't retain any memories of her past life, and the alien parasite inside her at the time of her death could not have 'inserted' itself into her DNA allowing it to be cloned with her. Bringing her back any of the other ways, making it her grand daughter, making her an android, even making all of Alien3 having been a hypersleep hallucination, any of those would have been better.The effects: Not only were they not used to the advantage of the story in any way, in some ways, they were downright bad. Everyone always goes on about how 'cool' the swimming aliens were. Number one, it was little more than a neat little gimmick. And two, it was poorly executed. The CGI aliens looked, well, like CGI aliens. In other words, they looked fake. They weren't quite photo-realistic in their appearance & movements. And they were on screen for all of about 3 seconds. Also the final scene reentering Earth's atmosphere was awful. It looked like they ran out of money and hoped no one would notice. And most of all the, ahem, newborn. The achieved something here alright. They found a way to make H.R.Giger's alien, the scariest movie monster ever, look like something out of a Lucy skit. When that thing appeared I sunk in my seat in embarrassment.The cast: I really like Winona Ryder, but she never was & never will be an action heroine. It should have been obvious from the start that she was a completely wrong choice. And Sigourney, well, she got her 10 million dollar check and sleepwalked thru the role, if not deliberately sabotaging the film because she's sick of her association with them. As far as the rest of the cast, they were all completely forgettable. So I've completely forgotten them. Other than Dan Hedaya and Ron Perlman, who serve as nothing more than comedy relief.The performances: I can sum them up thusly- The director didn't speak or understand English. And it shows. Didn't it occur to anyone that that might be a bad idea?! In all seriousness, I've watched lots of MST3K and Roger Coreman has made better movies than this.Alien Vs. Predator, a seemingly more derided film, just came out on DVD and while not up to the standard of either Alien or Aliens it was about a million times better than this one.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's a fun movie,"I think people are a bit harsh on this movie cause of how good the first 2 movies were, but this movie is actually quite entertaining on it's own. Although it lacks the suspense and good action from the first 2 movies, this one has it's own style of entertainment, even if the movie did have some flaws. I found myself really enjoying it and wasn't dull or boring like ""Alien 3"", it doesn't do any damage. Characters were interesting or at least stood out, it's simply a fun film on it's own but just can't come close to being good as the first 2, which is why I think a lot of people seem to bash the film for. I wished there was more alien action and firepower in this one, despite it's flaws this movie was simply fun to watch and adds new stuff to the genetic aspects that is simply fun to watch.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Did we need a fouth?,"Following the disappointment of alien3's performance and the death of Ripley, it was thought that the alien franchise was finished, going out on a high - the completion of the films and Ripley, with Ripley dying in the struggle to kill the alien that had become her whole life.Once the potential earnings had been calculated, it probably didn't take very long to decide to piece together a sequel.  This was always going to be messy - can you do an Alien movie without Weaver? How can you bring your main character back to life? Alien v's Predator anyone?!  Once they pieced together a script and got Weaver on board it was all set to go.Let me lay my cards on the table - I don't like this film.  Yes, the direction is brilliant visually with some great set pieces.  The story is good  for some of the film, turning the conspiracy story up to 10 with aliens being bred in captivity, but after the aliens get out the story is mostly a chase and kill deal and then goes onto some nonsense about a new breed of alien that looks like milky bars!Apart from the visuals and the conspiracy angle this is pretty ordinary stuff, it doesn't deserve to be part of such a classic series.  As a stand alone film it is OK but an Alien movie can't be just OK.  The performances are so-so, Weaver enjoys the fact that her character is allowed to be more powerful than usual but this doesn't actually make it a better performance, the fact that Jeunet fills the film with the French actors from his other films makes it slightly more interesting but no less average.Just because Jeunet put the guns back into the Alien series doesn't make it good.  There isn't anywhere near the tension of the other movies and there's certainly no horror.  A good sci-fi movie but it could be any movies, there's nothing that really means it could only be an Alien movie here.",,Anonymous,Horror

This nail-biting picture contains tension from start to finish , gory scenes aplenty , thrills , some strong scares , slime , emotion , entertainment and good acting . It is a superb cinematic combination of Sci-Fi , monster movie and terror . This is a brutal , considerable violent and exciting sci-fi thriller that scales new heights of savagery even by the standards of the 70s , 80s and 90s. The result is a throughly violent but undeniably thrilling action movie with a strong cast giving sweatily good value to their abrasive characters . Spectacular as well as bloody slaughter sequences took long time to shoot and were extremely difficult to make . Magnificently designed creatures , originally created by the artist HR Giger . However , this time H.R. Giger was openly displeased that he wasn't given a credit for his alien designs and fired off a letter of protest to 20th Century Fox . Interesting as well as twisted screenplay by Joss Whedon , though he has commented on his dissatisfaction with the movie , fans had speculated that the finished article deviated from his original script in some fatal manner, however he put such rumors to rest ; his dialogue, action and plot were essentially intact . However he had written with a playful, tongue-in-cheek tone, which didn't work when the director decided to ""play it straight"". Sigourney Weaver breathes fire into Ripley and remaining actors are all magnificent as the crew of a futurist starship . This is the only Alien movie not to be shot in England , one of the reasons for this was that co-producer Sigourney Weaver didn't want to travel . Sigourney Weaver was paid $11 million to come back as Ripley, which was the entire budget of Alien ,(1979) . The ending part is particularly exciting with Sigourney Weaver battling the malicious alien and with exciting underwater scenes that took three weeks to film . The underwater segment was shot on a specially constructed sound stage on the Fox lot, which was converted into a permanent water-tank . The production had trouble finding enough studio space as major productions like Titanic (1997), Starship Troopers (1997) and Jurassic Park (1997) were all taking up most of the available studio space in Hollywood . This ¬®Alien: Resurrection¬® by Jean Pierre Jeunet has an extraordinary cast such as Winona Ryder , Dominique Pinon , Ron Perlman , Gary Dourdan and Michael Wincott . The picture packs an original music by John Frizzell , plenty of thrilling and moving sounds . Colorful and adequate cinematography by Darius Khondji . The $50-60 million budget was significantly lower than the director Jeunet and writers originally imagined , being filmed at Fox studios in Los Angeles, California . Therefore, sets were toned down in scale and a more claustrophobic shooting approach with a lot of close-ups to characters' faces was taken .The gaps between the four Alien films steadily decreased.

The resurrection of a popular series,"Let's recap.The first alien film, which was directed by Ridley Scott is the film that started it all.  Scott's direction was sharp and ""Alien"" had the most tension-filled setting of the series and it brought to life a truly horrifying creature.  But that was twenty-three years ago.  ""Alien"" since it was released in 1979, has become seriously dated and seems to have lost some of its potency.""Aliens"", which was directed by James Cameron, is the most well-known film in the series and the most successful.  This time instead of Ripley going up against one alien, she must now go up against an entire nest of the deadly creatures, but with the help of a few good marines added to the bunch.  The ultimate question was of course, would excellent firepower be enough to combat the aliens?  Cameron focused a lot on action and tension, which transformed ""Aliens"" into a war movie of sorts.  I liked ""Aliens"" the most and hasn't lost any of its ability to still shock its audience.""Alien 3"", directed by David Fincher, is the most underrated of the series. Fincher changed the series by doing something new with it by adding his trademark dark settings to the film.  Instead of continuing the trend that was pioneered by James Cameron, he went back to step one, while still taking the series in a new direction.  He created one of the most dark and depressing horror films ever brought to life.  Though for some odd reason, audiences missed that entirely.  Fincher had originally intended the film to be much longer and with more character development, but executives at Fox had cheated him out of his own vision by removing most of said footage.Now we have ""Alien: Resurrection"", released in 1997 and directed by acclaimed French film maker Jean-Pierre Jeunet.  Set two-hundred years after the events of ""Alien 3"", Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has been cloned from a sample of her DNA and must continue her ongoing fight with the deadly alien this time with the help of a group of futuristic space pirates and a mysterious woman named Call (Winona Ryder).It goes without saying that Jeunet is a visual genius.  He has a real sense of bringing life into his scenes and giving the movie a fantastic look.  The gore here is pretty extreme and some scenes will certainly make your skin crawl, turning the movie into a freak show of sorts.  But that could ultimately be what Jeunet was trying to do, I'm not quite sure.  That is no reason to hate this film however.  An excellent addition to the series that is not to be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alien Resurrection (4/10),"The fourth installment to the Alien saga is a film that should absolutely never have been made. The movie was solely made just to cash in on the title without having any creativity or narrative to the stories franchise whatsoever. The thought of bringing Ripley back as a clone is just an outrageous plot line to begin with. Ripley's character completely 180'd in attitude and spirit and other characters in the film are weak, stale and have little character development. The vast majority of this movie is just a big stretch including the ending. One redeeming aspect of Resurrection is that it is ruthless and seemed to have good gore effects that were disturbing and were of quality to the first two alien movies. Otherwise it should be seen as part of the entire franchise but will likely leave you disappointed.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ripley's Saga Ends,Alien Resurrection brings back the action of Aliens and combines it with the grimy goriness of Alien 3 to provide a film that is creepy and entertaining at the same time. The film's strength involve a number of interesting ways to reinvent the Aliens and a memorable cast of actors.The film really seems to bring the Alien-franchise's more sensual aspects to life with the resurrected Ripley. The film also has many great confrontations with the Aliens and the final act of the film provides one of the strangest and most rewarding finishes of any of the Alien films.The film's only real weakness is that it doesn't quite match the emotional conviction of Aliens and the story is more of a wrap up then a stand-alone chapter. Riddick and the Aliens make a grand exit with this film which is interesting enough to keep the audience invested and entertaining enough to avoid a dragging pace which the first and third film suffered from.,8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Monster's Mother,"Accidentally stumbled into Alien 4 (Resurection). Remembered it as a watered down version. But I enjoyed it beyond expectations, although the ending seems a little cheap. Maybe they ran out of money because the special effects at the end are somewhat cheesy, but as a whole Alien 4 has almost the same energy and feel as Alien 2 (Aliens).The acting is particularly good in Alien 4. Better than in 2 and 3. I loved the stereotyped characters. The music is glorious as it should be. The effects are deliberately scaled down to gritty and dark, which is the way I like it. The first half of this movie is just as in the other versions the best part, because of the building up of the suspense. However once the monsters are beginning to attack it sort of demystifies the suspense and the action is not as well visually portrayed as has been done before, probably caused by the studios refusal to invest more money. This was a shock for the director who expected a bigger budget. But if you can look past some very cheap backsets and cheap explosions than the action, story and acting are enjoyable.Alien 4 was co produced by Sigourney Weaver so it is safe to assume she has had some influence on the story. She always had said before that she wanted to ""mate"" with the monster in another sequel. And that ""mating"" with the monster is what makes Alien 4 so special. Sigourney Weaver has become the mother of the monsters in Alien 4.Alien 4 has got some great humoristic oneliners that wouldnt look bad in an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. The jokes are good so they add to the general funny feel of this Alien version.All in all a very enjoyable light Alien version but certainly not the best. But I like it more than Alien 3. Too bad for the cheap ending otherwise this 4th sequel could have been as enjoyable as some of the other editions.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"In space, no one can hear you scream...","... in rage! Alien 3 was supposed to end the saga, but since they wanted to make more money, Fox decided to make another sequel. Only problem: how were they going to do it? As you may remember, David Fincher's underrated third installment ended with Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) sacrificing herself to put an end to the alien threat for ever. As there can't be an Alien film without Weaver (and those who have seen Alien vs. Predator know it), something had to be done to bring her back convincingly. Hence Alien: Resurrection.Taking place 200 years after the events of the third film, Resurrection solves the death issue in the most original way: cloning. That's right, the movie opens with a group of scientists finally succeeding, after seven disastrous attempts, in creating a perfect copy of Ripley. While the people involved in the experiment are thrilled, the crew of the Betty (a spaceship that stopped by for supplies) are not as excited. It does not take long to figure out why: the scientists' real purpose was to revive the Alien Queen that was inside Ripley at the time of her death, and use the offspring as biological weapons. And when the creatures start spreading terror and death, everyone realizes that maybe it wasn't such a good idea.To be fair, the premise was not that bad: the idea of a cloned Ripley and the conspiracy regarding the aliens could have been awesome, if used correctly. Which is something neither writer Joss Whedon (who usually is a terrific storyteller, as Buffy and Angel prove) nor director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (yes, the same guy who did a masterwork like Am√©lie) know how to do. While the production design is superb and the special effects are generally good (with the exception of the hideous ""Newborn"" alien), the suspense and claustrophobia that made the first three movies unique are gone. What was meant to be a blend of sci-fi and horror is turned into a straight-out action flick, complete with loud guns, lame dialogue (maybe Whedon was suffering from writer's block in that period) and lousy characterizations: apart from Weaver, who does her usual job with finesse, and Ron Perlman, who plays a rude-yet-charismatic scumbag, no one is able to add something extra to a bunch of disposable, two-dimensional stereotypes, not even a clearly miscast Winona Ryder, who seems to have lost all the charm and intensity she had in the likes of Heathers and Edward Scissorhands.Once again, the law of diminishing returns has been confirmed: aside from a few inspired moments early into the film, Alien: Resurrection is the most disappointing movie in the series. While Ridley Scott, James Cameron and David Fincher's contributions knew what they were aiming at and hit the target, Jeunet's franchise-closer doesn't even know where to aim.5,5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
You have got to be kidding me!,"The fourth chapter in the ""Alien"" series is by far the worst in the bunch. After the lackluster success of the third film, I was expecting a major ""pick-me-up"" for this one. Leaving the theatre that cold November night, I actually came to the conclusion that the third film was BETTER. The problem with ""Alien Resurrection"" is that it doesn't feel like an ""Alien"" film. I missed the Ellen Ripley from the first three films. She was a caring person; someone the audiences liked. In this film, she's a cold, steely I-don't-give-a-crap clone. The violence was horrific and the special effects weren't that impressive in my opinion. They should have gotten a real director for this film.

Alien: Resurrection is SO much better than you remember it being,"When people think of the worst movie in the Alien saga, automatically what comes to mind is ""Alien: Resurrection."" While it is true that it is among the lesser Alien movies (Resurrection, Alien 3, Alien vs. Predator 1&2), it is honestly kind of a dumb masterpiece. What that means is while this movie may be really weird and off the rails and bloated at times, it has a certain charm and awesomeness to it that Alien 3 doesn't have. While I actually don't hate Alien 3, it is easily the worst of the main 6 Alien movies (Alien, Aliens, Alien 3, Alien: Resurrection, Prometheus, and Alien: Covenant).

What is perfect? Why is this movie NOT!?,"What is perfect? Answer: The Alien Creature, the pure quality of the being; its lifecycles, its seductive and poetic and immensely horrific image... in short; `The Alien'.Why isn't `Alien: Resurrection' perfect? Answer: Allow me to sum the perspective: The four movies: 1: Alien - A mystic and highly horrifying and chilling introduction to the Alien universe = Perfect!! 2: Aliens - Builds upon the previous story without any attempt of copying the first movie (which is often the universal mistake of a flopping sequel). `Aliens' adds another type of storytelling to the Alien-universe. It is told with high pace and with wild action of the highest quality = Perfect (especially directors cut)!! 3: Alien 3 - Just as the second movie it builds the story. Its telling technique is a little like the first movie but it never becomes an obvious copy and the story expands the Alien-universe even further > Perfect!! The same Alien-topic told differently in all three movies and every story builds the universe further: these three movies complete the cycle perfectly. Yet it is a cycle that can easily be expanded if it is done with the same grace as mentioned above! This is where `Alien: Resurrection' fail.`Alien: Resurrection' - The telling technique is not completely off yet very close to `Aliens', but it makes two fatal mistakes: I: The theme of the Alien-universe has so far been horror and action on the highest level. `Alien: Resurrection' is told in a way so the horror aspect is perhaps not lost but seriously down prioritised! One can justify this by saying that so was `Aliens'; that's true, though not as mush. However, it does NOT justify that humour and corny remarks are the new main ingredient along with action. But please Jean-Pierre Jeunet accept the fact that Alien IS HORROR and not something in between - which is the first fatal mistake the movie has! II: Referring to the definition of ""perfect"" as mentioned above, then there is no reason to change anything about the Alien creature: Why the new design of the eggs: Why make the opening of the eggs look like the anus of a fat jellyfish when the old design with a hard shell was perfect?! And most off all why change the whole mother design... making a big fat skeleton-baby instead? If one should change these two `mistakes' it would mean another design told in another horrifying way: That would have been a number four to be proud of!But let's face it! The movie has many great action scenes and after all it is Alien and one can't stop from being impressed a little - Therefore I recommend seeing it and that is the only `therefore'!Can't wait for number 5, perhaps it will bring order to the chaos `Alien: Resurrection' created in the cycles of the Alien! Anyway, any visualization of the Alien-universe is always welcomed - no matter the quality the first three will always be perfect!",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Resurrection Rocks!!,"I think that I am one of the few people that really loved this movie. I love this movie because of the great Special Effects, the great story and the cool characters of the movie. The way they bring Ripley back to life is brilliant, I mean.... I would have never thought it up. I also think that Jean-Pierre Jeunnet really shows his talent with this movie. The visuals in this movie are awesome. And I even think that the Newborn was a great idea too, and I also think it looks great too. And don't think I never saw an other Alien-movie because I saw and own them all. I'm a real Die-Hard Alien-fan. I mean... Aliens is still the best one(I don't think that will ever change), but I think that this movie is much better as Alien 3 and maybe even a little better as Alien.(although that is a Classic of course) But I think Alien Resurrection is a must-see for every Alien- and Sci-Fi Fan.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Joss Whedon Does Alien,"Two centuries after her death, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is revived as a powerful human/alien hybrid clone who must continue her war against the aliens.Roger Ebert felt ""there is not a single shot in the movie to fill one with wonder"", later naming it one of the worst films of 1997. The first part may be reasonable, but the second part is a bit much. I mean, heck, this is a Joss Whedon script with the director of ""Delicatessen"". How can that fail?

Pointless and awful. Guess that makes it awful pointless.,"I feel sorry for Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Obviously a talented director with an eye for spectacle, he has been saddled with one of the most hackneyed and downright groan-inducing scripts ever. Basically a haunted house movie set inside a spaceship (two, actually) full of the eponymous Aliens, writer Joss Whedon scraped the bottom of the cliche-barrel, bringing us not-at-all-lame scenes of people wandering down dark hallways and sticking their heads into acid-burned holes for no particularly good reason (other than to be eaten, of course). The movie liberally steals ideas and scenes from Jim Cameron's Aliens, which is okay, I guess, in an incestuous and cannibalistic kind of way. The sets, the characters and the banter are all pale, inept imitations of stuff we've already seen in the series. Too bad they couldn't have stolen a speck of intelligence from the previous three Alien movies.This is a noisy, ugly and boring movie... but like a train wreck, it's worth seeing, if only to awe in how someone could manage to louse up a movie about shooting aliens and wearing leather pants. But my hat's off to Whedon, Jeunet & co.; they loused it up royally.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Love this movie!,This sequel is pure fun and I watch it all the time. This is before CGI went 100% and still features great animatronic alien creatures. The plot is exhilarating and the cast all mostly nail their roles. The plot progression is a fun creative 'what if' kind of plot that takes an Outer Limits abomination alternative approach that is monstrous enough to work for a one-off. Sigourney Weaver is at the top of her game here as usual and Winona Ryder offers a great iconic 1997 classic appearance here as the loveable Annalee Call. This film was good enough that it should have jumpstarted the material. I only hope a future sequel takes advantage of a menacing and dreamy approach like this film. This one features an amazing look at animatronics and an unforgettable iconic ensemble. I dont subscribe to the hate. Love this whole series.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"the weakest in the series, but still had its moments","Obviously, all of the problems experienced in pre-production doomed this film. While the trippy nature of the film was intriguing, it was lacking in so many areas (I mean, how big is this ship where you have to run for seemingly hours to get from one point to the other). Anyhow, this film needed a few more drafts in the script, and it was obvious Winona Ryder phoned in her performance. However, the lighting, cinematography, CGI and editing was excellent.

The worst of all Alien movies.,"This is by far the worst of all Alien movies. Alien & Aliens are two incredibly fantastic movies - they probably defined how Sci-Fi movies would look in the future, like 2001 did, and featured incredibly talented actors and superb scripts.They have been the exact opposite to Alien3 and Resurrection. I feel this movie is too ""cool"", artificial and fast-paced - you cannot convey to the audience that what you see on the screen is really happening if things go much faster than in real life - which is really bad since suspense cannot really be created because you do not feel it could really happen. The cast and the script is a joke.Always look on the bright side of life - at least Weaver earned $11,000,000 for this one, according to IMDB. But still it is like accepting a bribe for making a really bad movie. It is against principle, it is dirty, and in the end, you have a bad conscience and wish it would never have happened.Weaver is an extra-ordinary actress who truely deserves several Academy Awards - but her public image suffers from bad movies like this one, which is very, very very sad :(",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than Alien 3 in all ways,"To view back at the previous films: Alien in my opinion was a mega-hit success and one of the only films I rated 10 out of 10. It's sequel, Aliens was also good, but maybe a little too much action, but the sequel still kicked butt and one of the few films I give 9 out of 10. But then came Alien 3 which in my opinion sucked, it had too many F-bombs and the Dog Alien was just a load of stress, Alien 3 was one of a number of films I gave 4 out of 10.But now here is the fourth film known as Alien Resurrection.This film was the runner-up to Aliens because I actually thought it was good. The film takes place in 2850 (200 years after Alien 3)but does not really seem like it actually.The story is about Ripley resurrecting from the dead after 200 years had passed after many failed tries. And 14 aliens come along and bring back the classic spirit of the saga. It also seems that Ripley was carrying and Alien Queen inside her and made the 14 Facehuggers.One of the strangest parts of this movie is the Alien Newborn, who the queen gave birth too but was killed by her own child. the newborn apparently has a crush on Ripley which I thought was kinda strange.But still, there was plans for an Alien 5 which is now never going to be made. Alien Ressurrection was still a good enough of a close to the saga.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great director, wrong project","First off J P Jeunet is a great director you need only see Amelie to recognise that, but he is most to blame for this franchise killer of a movie. His style just doesn't suit this kind of action filled popcorn cinema and coupled with some bad casting choices and a mediocre storyline this really is poor.Watch Alien, Aliens or even Alien 3 and they are all far superior to this effort. It's all fairly poor stuff on show here with the exception of one great set piece the underwater alien chase scene is heart stopping. But unfortunately the memory of this is soon erased by the milk baby alien at the end (possibly the worst alien creation i any big budget sci fi movie).Disappointing 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Actually a great Alien film, just not the one fanboys wished for..","Easily stands up to repeated viewings and the director and designer's fresh take actually bring something genuinely quirky and interesting to the Alien series. It's a shame this film is much maligned, it's actually a fantastic film with some genuinely suspenseful and icky moments... There was never going to be a point in retreading Scott's or Cameron's takes..and after what the studio did to dir Fincher on Alien 3 the franchise definitely needed the touch of an auteur with an inventive vision.I just saw Heaven's Gate after many years of reading what a terrible film it supposedly was - only to discover it's actually a great film... I hope time is the great equalizer for films like AR..many appalling films get lauded and do very well commercially whilst often audiences and critics don't understand or appreciate certain others because they do not suit the times or fashion..Alien Resurrection is one of those breaths of fresh air that operates on a level above what many so obsessed with the genre are able to appreciate.When you consider how truly awful the AvP films have been this is easily a masterpiece by comparison!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Good Lord, that was awful!","Since there was nothing else very interesting on cable this evening, I watched ""Alien Resurrection"" for the first (and last) time on HBO. I am a tremendous fan of both Sigourney Weaver and Winona Ryder; therefore, by the end of this waste of celluloid, I was sad to have seen them in this... this... send-up? (I think Weaver and Ryder knew the truth, because, wow, were they just walking through their roles.) The best of all the Alien films was the first: ""Alien."" Why? I can think of three reasons right off the bat -- 1) Ridley Scott directed masterfully (especially for a first feature film), 2) this was a film based on characters (even the alien) and not gadgets, and 3) because in ""Alien"" the idea was new and fresh, it was (dare I say it?) original. And credit Scott that it was at least as suspenseful as Hitchcock's very best -- possibly more so. For ""Aliens"" John Cameron (writer, director) thought the original idea was good, so instead of being original himself he threw a bunch of money at it. He tossed in some unnecessary back story, filled the screen with gadgets and people in black rubber suits crawling through the air conditioning ducts atop sound stages at Fox, and had nearly all the characters play it either ""over the top"" (Bill Paxton comes to mind) or over-simplistically. Do you really want me to believe that, with the exception of Vasquez and Hicks, those intergalactic Marines were a group of ""tough hombres""? But then, maybe Cameron was just practising for ""Titanic,"" great eye-candy with little or no script support (he co-wrote) or depth of character. Give credit where it is due, though: Cameron sure has made a lot of money at the box office. Does this say something about him, or about us? Meanwhile, back at the Alien films... ""Aliens 3"" was just dreadful, and had story potholes that could swallow a Buick. (Actually, the book was much better than the film. Surprise, surprise.) I did find a bit of humor in it, upon reflection, when Ripley did herself in the very same way Arnold Schwarzenegger would later do in ""T2"" (another Cameron film, proving he can even steal ideas from himself... I wonder if he realizes it?). But did ""they"" stop there, stop milking this cash cow? Heavens no. They gave us ""Alien Resurrection."" To tell the truth, I wish they hadn't, and had donated the shooting budget to their favorite charity instead. Or maybe they could have spent some of it on a script that would have created some audience connection with -- and caring for -- the characters. But then, such stuff as ""story"" in a bad action movie would have just gotten in the way of making one more ""really cool"" special effects shot. Come to think of it, though, there really wasn't anything ""special"" about those, either: that sort of computer stuff has been done again and again, though I think the dinosaurs in ""Jurassic Park"" (for instance) had more heart and soul, more character -- more STORY -- to them than these goop-filled head-bangers did. I do wonder, though, what the day-rate was for the grip to do the run-around-in-the-queen-alien's-prenatal-abdomen-just-before-giving-birth shots... Just wondering... There was one -- count it: ONE -- good thing in ""Alien Resurrection"": there was no ""grip-help"" from just-out-of-frame -- Sigourney actually made the backwards half-court basketball shot, and got nothing but net. I'll bet it took Jeunet a few moments to call ""cut"" on that take just from the shock. Should have wrapped the whole movie there and gone home... Oh, well...",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The Good, the bad and the ugly.","Every Alien installment has had a new director at the helm, also bringing about a new style for the series. While Ridley Scott made a more claustrophobic sci-fi horror, James Cameron went all out and made a big combat movie and David Fincher made a more bleaker film which looked better and more ""arty"". After that film's failure, people thought the series was doomed and wrote it off until a 4th Alien film was announced with Jean-Pierre Jeunet at the helm, director of Delicatessen, City of Lost Children and the later film Amelie. So is it good? Heh... nope. Is there any redeeming quality to it at all? Well let's just say this: you know the film's in trouble when you actually have to think what was good about it.The story... Ripley's blood/DNA, taken from the hospital ward of the prison colony, is used to create a clone of her former self. Aboard a military science vessel, where now the Alien species are being bred by some deranged scientists, a group of smugglers are hired to provide ""bodies"" for these disturbing actions. Sigourney Weaver is haunting and rather creepy as this new Ripley who has Alien DNA and a ""relationship"" with the creatures. Winona Ryder is Call, a renegade and obsolete android who's a recent addition of the space pirates, that get more than they bargained for on this delivery. Fittingly Ripley and Call show the most human character despite their strange background. Most of the other characters are nothing more than bait for the Aliens. Dominique Pinon as the crippled pirate is an exception. Being there are few surprises, this film works better as a Sci-fi/horror adventure film. The story itself is worthy and interesting but underdeveloped. Too much time is spent on the gory attacks. There are too many unnecessary characters as well.The action in this movie wasn't even slightly believable, starting with the shootout between the criminals and the soldiers aboard the ship. At very short range, every soldier is killed and not a single criminal even wounded. Ripley escaped from certain doom on several occasions - I never felt as if she was in any peril at all. Then the action kept coming to a dead stop just when things were getting interesting. For instance, when everyone is in a huge hurry to get off the ship, Ripley decides to stop and wipe out a room full of failed clones. Truly one of those ""Aw, you gotta be kidding me"" moments. The set design and the look of the film though was starting to get better, relying on dim corridors and small lighting, much like the first film. And an action scene involving an underwater set is quite thrilling and the aliens certainly never looked better. But ultimately these are kind of superficial since a great scary experience like Alien or a blast like Aliens is sorely missing here. Overall, this movie is not a worthy sequel to the other films. Even Alien 3 was much better than this - it had loads of atmosphere, characters that one cared about, and you actually felt as if they were in extreme danger.Overall rating: 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

The worst of the bunch.,"Before Alien Resurrection it was referred to as the Alien Trilogy.  After it's release it was still referred to as the Alien Trilogy, that fact pretty much sums up the value of this movie.  The ""Alien"" story is a mere backdrop for the latest in special effects, and spectacular though they may be they certainly can not make up for what is missing.  The most important aspect of ""Alien"" was that it was believable, totally plausible, and filmed in such a way that the seriousness of the story was always the most important aspect. That fact remained intact for 3 movies, until Jeunet came along and turned it into a parody of itself.  Jeunet steals lines and scenes from the earlier movies to bolster this movie's credibility, but with little success, and even less originality.  Given Sigourney Weaver was not initially paid for ""Aliens"", I prefer to think of Resurrection as ""Sigourney's Revenge"". She probably got paid more for this movie than the 3 prior movies combined. All this so she can do a poor imitation of Ah-nold from ""The Terminator"". Winona Ryder is pitiful as the emotional android.  She should stick to being a burned out teenage pot head, because that's the role she plays best and obviously comes most naturally. But that's not totally fair, because you can't act if you don't have a plot.  The scene with the flame thrower was ridiculous, it was such a poor copy of the incredible original. The scene where frozen limbs break off, what an original idea that was, can you spell T2? The mother alien, the largest, nastiest, creature that ever ripped an android in half with it's 2 hands, was killed off by a single blow from it's own offspring, a creature that looks like it's outfit was picked up at a Halloween costume store for $25.   Everyone I know laughed when they saw it. ""Unique visual genius""?

Excellent,"Starting at the begining... I saw the movie ""Alien"" for the first time ever in 1997.  Slowly the viewer approaches a ship that looks almost like a city. We are taken inside.  Breezes and small sounds fill the inside of the ship. We are taken on a silent tour, and then watch as the computer wakes the few passengers up and the movie begins. After watching the movement and feeling that Ridley Scott (the director) put forth for all us ""movie goers"" my curiosity was stirred.  Honestly, as a woman myself who lives a complicated human life I could relate to Ellen Ripley.  Whether it was her struggle to keep alive even while all those around her are destroyed, or just a struggle to stay in her status position or responsible position.   All of us feel all that way at some time.  So, after Alien, I saw Aliens.  The sequel was well written and believable. That is something one doesn't see very often at the theater.  Ellen wakes up after 57 years and seems just as human as before.  The journey in that sequel is filled with suspense, drama and even laughter.  The ending is once again filled with sorrow yet hope remains.  For most, Aliens is their favorite movie of all 4.  The child and the new and complex characters sparked many other viewers interests.  Alien 3 was of course the movie I saw next.  I believe the 3rd sequel and last journey for Ellen is misunderstood. Many great fans of the saga do not like Alien 3.  Many say it must have been Ripley's dream and could have never really happened in her life story. I loved it.  I appreciate the introduction we all get into reality.  Because in real life, (just as Number 8 (the cloned Ripley) says in this new film Alien Resurrection), we die. IWhen Alien Ressurection first came to the theaters I was amoung the very first to get in line to see it.  Suddenly the lights go out.  A very  recognisable type of music begins. Skin is pushed around the screen, something is being made.  Space surrounds you.  Things are strangely quiet once again.  Another ship is in the distance.  We enter the ship, the ""Usm Auriga"" space craft and walk through the door to see the same men we remember from Alien 3. Men in white lab coats.  Inside a embryonic tube we see a child.  Quietly she says to herself,  ""My mommy always said there were no monsters.. no real ones.. but there are.""  Any fan knows this child is quoting another child named Newt.  Yet this time the words take on new meaning.  This journey of Ripley no.8 is a new one.  I think it is a very important addition to the saga.In conclution, after seeing all of these 4 segments of Ellen Ripleys' story in a row,  I think that the meaning behind it all is more than feminism or heroism.  I really believe it is all about being human.  I have really found a treasure in these 4 films and I hope that the future generations to come find her story just as interesting. After all, the year this movie came out we cloned an animal successfully for the first time.  What do we clone next?........",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Stupid, stupid, STUPID!!!","Oh boy. They must have paid Sigourney Weaver a HUGE sum of money to cast her, because I refuse to believe her actually liking this script - in fact, the entire idea.

It's no longer this wonderfully evil and perfect creature - and that hideous monster at the end makes me sick. I will never include this as an Alien film. It's a spoof, a parody, with bad acting, bad scenery and an idiotic script to back it all up.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Enjoyable,"This movie is not as good as Alien and Aliens, which are quite rightly called sci-fi classics, but it is an improvement over Alien 3(though I don't think it is as bad as it is made out to be). There isn't really anything new here admittedly, despite the film making a fresh slate, and it isn't as efficiently paced, but Alien:Resurrection cleverly makes an enjoyable enough film knowing that. The film looks great, as is the case of all the movies in the series, and Jean-Pierre Jeunet's direction is adept. The story is more consistent I feel, the script has its fine moments and the atmosphere is just terrific. Alien: Resurrection also is tense, pretty suspenseful, has its moments of humour and is very graphic and bloody, definitely the most graphic of the series not that it's a bad thing. Sigourney Weaver is also on top form here. Overall, enjoyable film that does its best despite having a lot to live up to. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Better than Alien 3, but not the same","Alien 3 was a survival movie without any weapons in a prison camp. I hated the film so much that I consider it the weakest of the saga. I couldn't even care for the Ellen Ripley character where even after her death, I was glad the film was over.Alien: Resurrection is the fourth film in the series where the writers figured out a way to bring back the Ellen Ripley character just so it can make more money and show more blood. In this saga, Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is a clone lab rat where the doctors want to see what they can do to her after being resurrected. Not only is she a lab rat, but the doctors and scientist have managed to capture the aliens and the queen and test them like lab rats along with bringing the queen's eggs and experiment human guinea pigs.Other cast members include Winona Ryder as Annalee Call, a member of a mercenary team led by Michael Wincott where other supporting characters include Ron Pearlman as a hotshot gun-shooter who remains a likable for the fans to enjoy. Brad Dourif (the voice of Chucky) is a doctor who gets victim to one of the experiments; Dan Hedaya has a short role as a general while Leland Orser has the same psychotic energy he brought in Seven (1995).What saves this movie is the action and usage of guns compared to the survival and no weaponry of Alien 3.

"Alien: Resurrection (1997) It's not bad, it's horrible","""Alien¬≥"" had already been much lower than the previous ones, but when it came to ""Alien: Resurrection"" the franchise managed to hit rock bottom.

An astonishing breadth of concept....,"There are few films that can endure until version IV.Alien Resurrection works on many levels. Given that after the three previous films we all know what the monster looks like, and what it can do, the new world we are asked to confront concerns relationships - involving humans, aliens, clones, robots, clone/alien hybrids. Maybe most importantly it examines the relationship between mother and offspring in a world of warped genetic engineering.The complexity of the plot might at first seem a weakness, but our previous knowledge of the concepts from the other three films allows the film to encompass many ideas that might otherwise be too confusing.How does it compare with the previous films?Alien was outstanding for the concept. Aliens was exciting, introducing the Space Marines. Alien 3, with perhaps the lowest budget and plot lines, still worked because of the ending. Alien Resurrection is by far the most disturbing.

Alien Desecration.,"With Joss Whedon's annoyingly smart-ass script delivering annoying comic-book characters spouting annoying one-liners, and director Jean-Pierre Jeunet's annoyingly incongruous visual style, Alien Resurrection is a truly dreadful film that besmirches all that has gone before. In short, it is annoying.With characters that wouldn't seem out of place in Whedon's terrible Serenity, some very bad CGI, awful acting (Winona, how did you ever manage to become a film star? Sigourney, were you having a laugh or what?) and an ending so bad I was unsure as to whether I should laugh or cry, this film is a failure on almost every level.Ripley, having died at the end of Alien 3, is cloned by the military, so that they can lay their hands on the alien queen that is inside her (is it just me, or does this make no sense whatsoever?). The new Ripley's DNA, however, is a fusion of alien and human, meaning that she now has superhuman strength, cool basketball skills and a liking for leather pants.With a queen now in their possession, the military scientists quickly grow themselves a batch of aliens, using some poor saps, kidnapped by a bunch of unlikeable space rogues, as hosts for their creatures. However, once 'born', these aliens prove smarter than your average ET, and they soon escape to cause all manner of bloody mayhem .Ripley, along with the rough and ready 'pirates' and an android terrorist, must try to escape death whilst also ensuring that the aliens do not successfully make their way to Earth.I will confess to enjoying the gratuitous gore in this chapter of the franchise but, between them, Jeunet and Whedon have loaded this film with so many naff elements that fans of the series will surely curse their names for what they have done.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very artistic and almost brilliant gore...Far too underrated!,"As one reviewer put it: Alien was about suspense, Aliens was an action movie, the third was a tragedy and this final one is gore. But just like Alien 3, for which Sigourney Weaver should have won the Oscar, also this fourth installment is underrated ‚Äì even by James Cameron, who ranked Alien Vs. Predator as the number three in the franchise. I think the same happened to the Matrix sequels; the second and third were incredible movies with lots of new stuff, but nobody particularly liked them. Why? The Matrix, as Alien, and Aliens were just some of the best movies ever made and probably Aliens is, with The Godfather 2, the only sequel I know that is equally good as the first (or better). The reason that sequels are still made is therefore commercial, not a director's ambition to leave his artistic mark. Still, Aliens, the first sequel in the series became a classic, why? The success of Aliens was due to the fact that James Cameron realized that for now only an action movie would do, making a totally different genre of his sequel. So how about Resurrection? If you ask me, I think this is a good sequel since it flowed naturally from the first three movies: we have the Ripley character and a bunch of people being hunted by the Aliens trying to make their way out into space. That part is familiar (= what we go to see an Alien movie for); the rest is new to make it a movie strong enough to stand on its own (that is why we still go to see a sequel). Resurrection had a comic book style script with humor, and beautiful decadent sets, almost futuristic Art Deco. Ripley herself was the perfect mix: she had something familiar, and lots of new stuff, since she was Ripley and yet, being cloned 200 years later with an Alien inside her, she wasn't Ripley anymore. Ripley being different was probably the thing many fans had problems with, but had she stayed the same helpful brave woman, the same fans would have complained it was all too repetitive. I think the fact she was and wasn't the same helped me to adjust to a new formula, which after three movies was inevitable. I thought this new Ripley and Alien-queen-in-one was a great find (albeit with disgusting consequences, making a smart anti clone statement at the same time); she was almost like a predator herself, with a humoristic and unpredictable tweak, still keeping her strong character alive that made her an extremely credible protagonist in the first three movies. Still, this movie got less than a 7 score. For me this is the paradox of sequels: when we get the new stuff we have not seen before we think the movie deviates too much from the original, and yet, too many familiar things make any sequel too repetitive. But to be fair: I have never seen a more disgusting movie, and I had problems with that. That is the reason I could never give it a 10 like the first two. But visually it was a pleasure to watch, making this director just as much an artist as Cameron or Scott were. Let's just say Alien and Aliens were classics and I am happy we got Alien 3 & 4, since I enjoyed them more than I was disappointed that they were not as good as the first two (impossible anyway). Resurrection had lots of new stuff, beautiful sets, and effects, and the acting acting, especially of Sigourney, was great: definitely 9 out of 10!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ripley! Believe It Or Not?,"Alien Ressurection (Ha! Urection!) (4) (1997) -I'm not sure that the people of Earth would consider this a successful mission at the end.I actually believe that the storyline of this film is equally as good as, at the very least, Alien3, maybe even the first. It's just a shame that the director and some of the cast have made it incredibly naff!There has always been moments of comedy throughout the franchise, but the poor acting and delivery of the jokes cheapens the film as a whole and makes it corny.They seem to have accidentally achieved what the makers of 'Starship Troopers' (1997) did deliberately and without that success, their hammy portrayals and B Movie style were clever and thoughtfully done, but most of this cast are exaggerated and pantomimic.Winona in particular is awful, why on Earth did they choose her for the part. Was it due to her devious, kleptomaniac nature?, which was at least a part of the character I suppose? To be honest, I'm not sure where she fits in as an actor?And why is Brad Dourif always so creepy? He's been married twice, so someone must find him attractive, but I've never seen him play a character that isn't completely freaky or seeming to have a hidden agenda. Don't get me wrong, he does it well, but he really is the stuff of nightmares.And even Ripley is a bit annoying in this one. The connection with the alien is all a bit sexual and disturbing instead of maternal and her clone behaviour makes her very odd. I've never said that she stands out as a brilliant actor, but she really seems to have been directed to be a piece of wood in this one.As I say, the actual story could have been good in the right hands. It's still a variation on the theme of the military trying to get hold of the alien DNA and use it to their advantage, but in a different setting, with more of the science behind it, which is done in a way that expands the 'Alien' universe and that bits good, but the performances just drag it down.The aliens themselves are brilliant as always, although one of them has a very nauseating nose and I don't like the relationship that they have with Ripley or the fact that she's ""Part Alien"", I don't think that element was necessary, although it did at least differ things from the others.None of this is spoilers, because it's all explained early on.The last alien death is pretty gross and some other bits of the film wouldn't be for the faint hearted, but as a sci fi/horror flick it ticks most of the boxes.It obviously doesn't score that highly because of the above, but it is still worth watching as part of the series.563.88/1000.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Painful, pseudo-Gothic, artsy-far*sy direction","Once again, set and costume design take precedence over common sense... I have been a fan of the Alien saga since the very beginning. I liked the first one, i adored the second one, i suffered through the third one and i was scared s***less that the fourth installment would be crappy. I have waited until i watched this movie five times before risking a review, hoping i'd find it some redeeming value. I failed...First, the evidence, this movie is science-fiction! It doesn't mean it doesn't have to make sense... The sets make no sense at all. No matter how advanced a future society may be, it makes no sense to use a spaceship the size of Rhode Island to house a hundred people. There is the slight matter of using materials and energy to build something that big. Second, i understand that some directors want to create a creepy atmosphere, but please... Water dripping from the ceiling in a spaceship? come on... Not to mention the looks of the characters... They look like some escapees from an euro-trash trendy disco. Now acting... Ron Perlman is brilliant, as usual. Sigourney Weaver has reached a new level in self-absorption... Her pseudo-feral Ripley has the believability of casting Barney the Dinosaur as Freddy Krueger. And look at the costume! Gee, now Christian Gauthier designs clothes for prisoners? The special effects execution was good, but the designing was hilarious. The final creature is a mess - people, look at Giger's work if you want to make something Giger-like. The first time I saw the movie, i choked on my popcorn so much i laughed. Spoiter: The scene where the creature gives birth made it to my scrapbook, between the Marx Brothers and the Three Stooges. In summary, the scenario made sense, but the whole execution was ridiculously bad.There is a lesson in this for the producers... Please, when you choose a director, look at what he made before... ""Delicatessen""-goes-to-space was to be expected...",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Aliens becoming more human ruins the whole idea.,"Alien: Resurrection bites the hand that feeds it.

Suddenly, this series has lost its energy and has become part of the movie muck we see too much of.  Let's see the aliens on earth in a global invasion (as UNLIKE ID4 as we can get).

It may seem trivial to some, but this film was much more enjoyable due to the fact that everything didn't happen in the dark. I do not think the darkness enhances the thrill of the series. The creatures are awesome themselves, and the new creature was magnificent. Seeing them in brilliant lighting made them even more thrilling.Sigourney Weaver and Winona Ryder were awesome together. They made an almost erotic team and I loved seeing them act.

Fun 90s ALien,"This is the first in the franchise where it feels like it's mostly a money grab. But a cheesy action movie that uses the franchise tropes and tries to build upon them by predicting what might work commercially is something I easily fall for. There are quite a few writing choices that don't make sense and Whedon's humor just feels icky a lot of times. But it was still pretty engaging and intriguing for me. The production design is great as always. Sigourney Weaver has got something different to do this time and does it with devilish charm. And I'm always down for watching young Winona Ryder. The last half an hour felt very weird with its choices. But overall, it got the charm of that late 90s scifi action movies I love which made this a very entertaining watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Resurrection ""Borrows"" Other Alien Attributes For Its Entertainment Purposes","Most could say that the Alien series was better off with the end of Alien 3. But this is Hollywood we're talking about, so they'll be wanting to toss out another Alien movie just for the heck of it. While Resurrection shouldn't have been made to start with, it actually does a good job at being a decent movie entertainment-wise.Sigourney Weaver is back as Ripley, who's somehow resurrected after over two-hundred years. How this was possible after Ripley pretty much burnt to death in Alien 3 I don't know, but the movie doesn't explain this much or at all. This actually works to Resurrection's strength since it doesn't try to be a smart movie anyway.Since critics and other audiences didn't like the direction David Fincher did of making Alien 3 a suspenseful more than action flick Resurrection has been give the ""Aliens treatment"". So don't expect much more than a movie that has military action scenes with aliens involved. While this doesn't make Resurrection much more than an action movie with the name Alien slapped on the aliens look as cool as ever and the action is satisfying.The acting in Resurrection is below-average, but that's expected as this is the fourth installment in the Alien series. There isn't much logic in Resurrection but it doesn't try to create much logic. Instead, the movie just focuses on two things, action and humor. Not a smart move in part of the Alien movies but I like how the direction was executed.Alien fans shouldn't be too disappointed by Resurrection, it's got some fun action scenes. And since the over delivery of the movie is better than your typical fourth installment in a movie franchise it should give them even more reason to say that Resurrection wasn't half bad.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Starting to get back on track...,"Recovering from the mediocre blow that was ""Alien¬≥"" put a lot of pressure on ""Alien: Resurrection"", and it was steep hill to scale for director Jean-Pierre Jeunet. With that being said, don't get me wrong here, because I am not saying that he failed, nor am I saying that ""Alien: Resurrection"" is a poor movie. No. The director managed to steer the franchise back towards the right track, which was established with the first two movies. But it just didn't fully reach the same level of entertaining or intensity.Personally I didn't get the aspect of cloning would mix the DNA of Ripley and the alien that she had inside her at the time of her death in ""Alien¬≥"". But hey, I guess it made for a theatrical twist to the storyline. And also the super-human direction that this was steering the Ripley character was also a bit too childish, in lack of a better word, in my opinion.The story in ""Alien: Resurrection"" takes place 200 years after ""Alien¬≥"". Ripley has been cloned and the alien queen inside her surgically removed, but the cloning process has mixed the DNA of Ripley and the queen, giving Ripley a mutated human/xenomorph DNA structure. And as the military is trying to breed the aliens for biological weapons, they soon find their space vessel overrun by perfect killing machines.The effects in ""Alien: Resurrection"" were adequate and getting back on track after the abysmal gallery of effects shown in ""Alien¬≥"". And it was, of course, nice to have multiple aliens and even a queen throughout the movie. Which leads me on to the creature birthed by the queen, as she no longer lays eggs, but gives birth much like humans do. The creature which was now closer in resemblance to a human that ever before, well of course it is a matter of personal preference whether you enjoyed that or not. Personally, I didn't like that creature particularly much. Sure it had some nice touches and details, but in overall it just deviated too much from the original alien strain. And furthermore, where did all the eggs in the kitchen area come from if the queen no longer laid eggs? That was a puzzle to me.""Alien: Resurrection"" doesn't have as much of an impressive cast as the previous three movies did. Sure, Sigourney Weaver is the main attraction, but aside from here then there isn't that much of an impressive ensemble of cast for my liking. The only two other people that really pulled their weight was Brad Dourif and Michael Wincott.Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet started to steer the franchise back on course, but just fully reached the endline with ""Alien: Resurrection"".",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

This one is a bit more bloody, so if you don't mind a bit of gore you should watch it, certainly if you enjoyed the other movies of this franchise.

Beating the likes of ""Bean"", ""The Avengers"" and ""Batman and Robin"".  The problem lies in the fact that it is totally the opposite of the original. Alien had suspense, I was actually scared out of my seat.  Why? because there was only one alien and I had no idea of its location.  However, Alien Resurrection has more aliens than would fill a galaxy. Horror films should follow one guideline.  Make sure the creature can't be seen, only then can the viewer use his/her imagination.Alien Resurrection fails to do this, and hence it fails as a movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Resurrection ma non tropo,"There are some grave injustices in this world. We are in front of one of them. This movie is EXCELLENT! It completely brought back to life a saga that was buried by another brilliant and not understood movie: alien 3. But the critics didn't let it. The issues of humanity, new way of facing the alien, new Ripley, dark environments, interesting characters and excellent direction make this film a near masterpiece of sci-fi, horror and action. The fresh direction from a french director that also brought us ""The City of Lost Children"" gives us a completely different movie that deviates from the normal pace of the alien movies. The only problem I can see in this movie is that the change is so big that the movie spends its entire time acomodating people to the changes, and doesn't face completely its issues, but that for me isn't a problem: on the contrary of what critics are saying, this opens the door for a grandeous Alien 5 in the future that could truly end the saga as it deserves. Two thumbs up for its excepcional musical score that brings back elements from the other three movies, and an applause for its great special and visual effects, bringing for the first time realistic CG aliens to life.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Runaway egos and unnecessary sequels,"Back when I was about thirteen, I remember cheering with delight upon hearing that this movie would be made. I was born too late to catch any of the preceding films in the cinema but thanks to play ground gossip and not-entirely-wholesome class mates I'd managed to catch all three on video in those heady few hours between getting home from school and the scramble to hide the boxes when my parents got in from work. Needless to say then, my hormone addled teenage self practically foamed at the mouth at the prospect of more alien carnage, especially when somebody mentioned they were bringing the guns back into the franchise. However, I was of course still too young to see it on the big screen and it wasn't until a plane flight back from Florida a year later that I finally caught Alien: Resurrection in all it's glory. I whooped and hollered with delight and thought it was the most bad ass thing I'd ever seen. However, upon watching it again recently, all it really achieved was reminding me of the old me (which ironically was the young me) and how easily pleased I was. So I guess the whole point of this whimsical and nostalgic tale which has most likely caused the majority of you to skip to the next review down after clicking the ""not useful"" button is simply this; for gun crazy, early teenagers wanting gore, violence and acid bleeding monsters, this is a an absolute must once you've seen Aliens. For the slightly more seasoned film goer however, the ones who would have chosen The Third Man, The Seventh Seal, Cool Runnings or Citizen Kane on the flight instead, Alien: Resurrection is ultimately unrewarding.Now, for all the plus points (Ron Pearlman!), the minus points (alien sex???) and the sitting on the fence points (is Distephano awesome or not? I can't tell), the principle reason for dismissing Alien: Resurrection is this: it's completely and utterly unnecessary. The original trilogy as I'm sure you're well aware runs in sequence quite beautifully. It moves from a haunting, slow paced opener, to a fast paced and action packed middle bit before climaxing in a grim, nihilistic opus of despair. Alien: Resurrection doesn't fit the storyline at all, it feels tacked on, the last slow gasp of the horse as it gets beaten to death. And given that two hundred years after Alien 3, scientists are able to clone Ripley and the alien inside her makes the character's noble sacrifice at the close of the third act less heroic and more of a delaying action.Credit where credit's due though, it does have a very striking visual style. The influence of French director Jean Pierre Jeunet has carried over into the Gilliam-alike cinematography where everything is filmed with muddied, hazy colours and bizarre machinery waits round every corner. The appearance of the scientists in particular is pure nightmare fantasy; all shiny white suits that lead up to heads wearing quirky optic goggles and topped off with slick, greased back hair. The corridors of the ship meanwhile are dimly lit, endless octagonal constructs that fittingly enough, look like the inside of an alien's intestinal tract. Alien: Resurrection may not be the high point of the franchise, but it sure as hell is the weirdest looking one. In fact, the best way to describe the whole thing would be as some kind of dark, science fiction carnival of the grotesque, with the 'grotesque' part ably supplied by a smattering of gore in which the human body is ruined in some incredibly inventive ways (at one point a man quite literally picks apart his own brain).Unfortunately though, imagery, gore and violence alone do not a good movie make. Unless it's 300. 300 was great. But I digress...At the forefront of the problem here is this new version of Ripley. I hate to pass judgement on an actress the calibre of Sigourney Weaver but it does seem as though her ego was left to run rampant on the film every step of the way. This carries over into her performance as well, with this version of Ripley remaining nothing more than an aloof, nonchalant presence to such an extent that even the emotional outpouring when she torches a clone lab feels altogether forced and unnatural. The Ripley of the previous movies was an impassioned and determined survivalist, this one is just sterile. This wouldn't be so bad if the rest of the cast could fill in the blanks but sadly, they're the most uninteresting bunch of xenomorph ready meals yet. There's none of the natural charisma or camaraderie of the marines or the inmates and with the exception of Dominique Pinon as an ass kicking, handicapped mechanic and Ron Pearlman as Ron Pearlman, they're very difficult to root for.By and large then, not a great film. It has its plus points but an uninteresting cast, silly concept and uninspiring heroine bring it down terribly and it's only real worth when compared to the rest of the series is as a catalogue of inventive deaths, best of which is undoubtedly the ""chestburster out the torso and through a man's head"" bit. It all reaches its zenith of course with the unveiling of the new monster, a human/alien hybrid that resembles a New York sanitation commissioner who just had the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man detonate above his head.And Winona Ryder was rubbish.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
It Had Interesting Ideas,"Ripley is cloned and brought back. She wasn't alone though, they also brought back the alien that was inside her. With a crew bringing some cargo on board the same ship these alien experiments go awry and the aliens escape. All that is left is Ripley and the crew of the Betty.The reason why I think this film gets so much hate is because it seems to cheapen the ending to Alien 3, which was the best thing about that film. It ended her legacy and the story in the franchise and now comes a fourth film that many thought was a cash cow waiting to be milked. Alien: Resurrection has some interesting ideas, but the execution of the film as a whole just seems like a misfire.The first had terror, the second had action the third had the ending, the only way to end the series. What does this one have? Again, the cash cow thing comes to mind. The producers thought if they got geek writer Joss Whedon and French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, they could fool the audience. It would seem that two rights can't make a wrong. Joss Whedon's original script was obviously changed, but in interviews he said that his final draft is what is seen on the screen. So what's the problem? The execution apparently. While Whedon went for a tongue in cheek aspect, Jeunet went down the straight and narrow and made the film serious. So I guess two rights can make a wrong.The characters are interesting and the actors portraying them I thought was the best thing about the film. Ron Perlman and Gary Dourdan are the two stand outs in my opinion. Weaver isn't the same Ripley we once knew and loved. She is different. Part alien, she acts like one in the film. Again, it was an interesting idea, but I found myself liking her less and less. Not as much as I hated Ryder though, she was irritating and boring.The film is looked upon as the worst one. Or the one that could be tossed up between Alien 3 as the worst. It's no bag of dirt. It's watchable, a lot better than the last two alien films we got. The problem was there was no emotion, specifically for a character who was different than what we knew. The script was written one way and the direction went in another. Neither was right or wrong, but together it doesn't work that well. The underwater sequence is great though, definitely the stand out scene among a bunch of boring running down corridors bits.Alien: Resurrection has no sense of danger or terror. All three previous films had this in abundance. The story tried it's best to bring back the character of Ripley, but we got a shallow clone. The human/alien hybrid wasn't scary, it looked like less of a threat than the normal aliens. The climax was non-existent and should have taken place on Earth, it would have added a bit more urgency. The film looks great though. Cheers.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Trashy? Yes. Bad? No.,"Scolded by many as a cinematic catastrophe, ""Alien Resurrection"" isn't as bad as its reputation. In the fourth installment of the Alien franchise, French Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet revels in B-Movie flavour. It's exaggerated, silly, gory, and (as far as I'm concerned) really entertaining. By the time this movie premiered, many people had a preconceived notion about what an Alien movie ought to be. Jeunet didn't give a s*it about that. I kinda respect that.Of course, there's moments that are plain stupid and overacted as all hell. But try watching this movie from a trash angle; maybe you'll be pleasantly surprised. As a side note, some of the more sexual moments reminded me of HR Giger's style, which is nice touch in my book.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Frankenstein Created Aliens - and almost got away with it,"Joss Whedon, who has sole writer's credit for Alien: Resurrection, is famously unhappy with the end result (""a crappy-ass movie"") and it's certainly a bit of a mess in narrative terms: after a thoroughly effective first half hour, the film doesn't manage to graft on to its very basic escape-from-alien-infested-ship storyline the more meditative and fantastical elements that are its real raison d'√™tre. Pacing goes haywire, and some sequences so strain credibility as to turn the film towards campy self-parody.  When you look both at Whedon's best writing (for Buffy on TV) and director Jean-Pierre Jeunet's earlier French fantasy films, control of plotting isn't really either's strong suit, and there's a nagging feeling of imperfect coherence here, a film that never quite came together. All the same, the actual ingredients are astonishingly inventive (perhaps unprecedentedly so for a third sequel to what was a very straightforward, if brilliantly executed, original).The story follows on from Alien 3, but its themes dovetail mainly with Cameron's first sequel, Aliens, especially the obsession with motherhood and family. Cameron's script for Aliens centered on the bizarre pairing of Ripley and the Alien queen as maternal figures, and that idea becomes the theme for a set of grand guignol variations here, as Whedon, Jeunet and the effects designers probe at the definition of what makes one human, what makes one a monster, and the strange fluidity between those categories. In many ways the end product less resembles the earlier Alien films than it does a classic Universal horror film, which (like all good monster movies) gives most of its sympathy to the monsters.I hardly need to add that Sigourney Weaver's dazzling and unsettling reinvention of Ripley as something that both is and is not human is what holds everything together - if only barely (some of the supporting players are less well cast, notably Dominique Pinon who's so great in Jeunet's earlier films, though I confess I do like Winona Ryder in a role that's awkwardly written at times). This is one of those films that gets more interesting and more annoying on repeated viewing - its weaknesses become ever more glaring, its complexities and innovations ever more intriguing.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The Last One, I Hope.","I picked up this film after learning that it was made by one of my favorite directors, Jean-Pierre Jeunet (City of Lost Children, Am√©lie). It was my hope that this installment would be better than Alien3 which, at least on that count, it succeeds, even though that's a low mountain to climb.The plot for this film is a predictable rehash of the last three films. You have your evil massive organization who keeps forgetting that the aliens are really bad. You have an android subplot (this time played by Winona Ryder) which adds nothing but continuity to the rest of the movies. You even have your ubiquitous ""Kill me"" scene where Ripley must kill someone with a flamethrower to save them from too much pain.However, without sounding too critical there are some good points to this film. The cast is perfect for an Alien film pairing up big names (Weaver and Ryder) with an excellent set of character actors like Dominique Pinion (The Return of Martin Guerre and Am√©lie), Brad Dourif (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and The Two Towers) and the ever odd Ron Perlman (Enemy at the Gates). This cast gives a valiant effort to bring something out of a script that seems to have been written by some 13 year old boys. Even so, the dialog is so silly it's hard not to wince.However, the one thing that really saves this movie from the truly awful category is the cinematography and feel of the film. Jeunet, known for his dark films, has really kept the feel of the first two films. The underwater Alien sequence is nothing short of genius. Even the alien/Ripley love child (no, I'm not kidding) follows with the dark and brooding spirit of the original films.The best I can say about this film is it redeems the series from the catastrophe of Alien3. However, this movie is repetitive, silly and without depth. Let us hope that this is the final film in the series so that no more slander can be thrown at what was once an terrifying experience.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Grossly underrated sequel with a lot to like about it.,"Years into the future, a clone of Ellen Ripley and other survivors find themselves trapped in an abandoned research ship overrun by the aliens they bred from her remains and try to escape before they're killed one-by-one.This here is an unjustly maligned sequel and actually has a lot of good stuff going for it. One of the better areas in the film is the high-intensity action that permeates the surroundings, really from the start and manages to get in a lot of great stuff from it. There's a multitude of chases here that are a ton of fun and really high-energy, from the walk-through of the flooded corridor and the swim through the underwater section all the way through to the trap with the eggs and the resulting shoot-out there, as well as other scenes from the rampage through the ship and taking out the evacuees in the escape process as well as the rather impressive attack in the escape pod at the end which contains a lot of great parts to it and really works well. This is helped by a rather well-designed ship location that allows for these tension-packed scenes to take place and generate a lot of fun. Another good plus is the high gore on display, from scarred faces, jaws ripped open and other extremely graphic kills that give off a great feel, and as usual the aliens are incredible. The only real flaw to this one is the rather inane segment that keeps a dead crew-member around for no reason than to keep a big-name member more involved in the film at that point. Also problematic is the early scenes of the clone interacting with the crew which goes nowhere, but overall this one is a lot of fun.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

one of my least favorite films....,"This is the perfect example of how a franchise can run itself into the ground.

A hell of a lot better than Alien 3 but worse than Aliens...,"I actually really liked this film. OK, so Ripley's characterisation was a bit off and the first half an hour was boring, but once it got going the action was fast and intense and the script was pretty good. It also has the most original plot of the series (apart from 1, of course.) The ending could have been better - although it was quite exciting, I'm getting bored of seeing Aliens being sucked out into space. Still, overall it was a very good film and I'd recommend that you at least rent it, if not buy it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The bitter end (hopefully)...,"It was very sad to see Ripley sacrifice herself in Alien3, but this movie changes my opinion completely! It is darker and far much more despairing, hurtful and depressing that the previous movie in the Alien-saga. I saw it just once and have successfully completely forgotten everything about it!Weaver and Rider may (or may not) have given solid performances, I don't know, and I really do not wish to know. For me, the Alien-saga begins with Aliens (the second movie) and ends at Aliens. Period. And there can be no stopping that.If you're looking for weak, or next to NO humor, a depressing story, repulsive and disgusting special effects and absolutely NOTHING to feel good about in the end, and an overall major disappointment, I would recommend this..this..thing.Oomph!-meter (from 5): *zilch*",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Slime Gentlemen Please!,"""Alien Resurrection"" is the fourth and final (to date) installment of the alien series starring Sigourney Weaver as Ripley. This episode was directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet.The story takes place 200 years after ""Alien 3"". A military ship commanded by renegade General Perez (Dan Hedaya) has replaced ""The Company"" in trying to capture and ""tame"" the alien creatures. two doctors (J.E. Freeman, Brad Dourif) have managed to clone Ripley from a DNA sample complete with an alien creature in her body. After they remove the creature the cloned Ripley begins to exhibit unusual powers. A pirate freighter arrives on board with a cargo to be used in the cloning experiments.The freighter is led by Elgyn (Michael Wincott) and includes among others, Call (Winona Ryder) who has her own reasons for being there and macho tough guys Johner (Ron Perlman) and Christie (Gary Dourdin). One of the crew is an advanced android, but who?By now the alien creature has matured and multiplied and wouldn't you know it, escapes captivity and begins to wreak havoc. The creatures rack up a pretty gruesome body count before the film's climax. There's lots of blood and gore and slime (perhaps too much) and brutal murders to go around. The film's climax is a little hard to believe but hey, this IS science fiction.Not the best of the series but a treat for those who enjoy blood and gore.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
What was a great series is now old like the Fridays.......,"I'll try to make this brief.  Alien was good because it set the tension up and then unleashed the terror.  Aliens was one of the best films ever made because James Cameron is brilliant, the supporting cast was spectacular and it was a terrifying experience.  Alien3 was okay because Ripley looked and sounded exhausted from facing the alien one too many times, and she dies with the monster.  Alien Resurection is just okay because there is nothing new to do here.  We have seen it all before and there is very little chance that the directors of 3 and 4 know how to create tension the way that Scott and Cameron did.  The film is tiresome.  Ripley isn't the frightened but tough heroine that she was before.  Now she is a terminator.  And that takes away from one of the elements that made the first and especially the second one so good.  In Aliens, Weaver had lines like,  ""I hope you're right. Because just one of those things managed to wipe out my entire crew. "" Now I expect her to say "" I'll be back. ""  It's just not the same.  And her bravado does not bode well for the picture here.  Having her this tough and emotionless would be like having Rambo as a wimp that begs the bad guys to stop before they torture him.  It just doesn't fit.Alien 4 is not a terrible film.  It is okay, but it does not have the feeling that a good Aliens film does.  And maybe that is asking too much of it because the first two were really incredible films.  But the series is tired and I really hope it is over.  The only way I would like to see another one is if Cameron directs.  And seeing as that is not going to happen, let this series come to end.  It's dead.  Ripley is dead.  The Alien is dead.  All the cool characters are dead.  May the series rest in peace. It's time to leave it alone.Alien series 1979-1997 R.I.P.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"An Entertaining, Terrifying Sci-Fi.","I had only seen one of the Alien movies before I saw Alien: Resurrection, which happened to be Alien3 , but I had heard lots about the ass-kicking series. Alien: Resurrection is not liked very much by critics, but I thoroughly enjoyed this flick, I own the film and watch it when I seriously need some horrifying stuff.Two centuries on from Alien3, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Lieutenant First Class, number 36706 is still very dead but Clone 8 - grown aboard the Auriga by the evil greedies at United Systems Military - looks damn near perfect (even if the only hair she has is her eyebrows when first we see her). From inside her, USM cut an Alien queen, then against the advice of General Perez (hairy-shouldered Dan Hedaya), let Ripley #8 live. She meets the six-strong vagabond crew of the Betty then USM's captive Aliens get smart and get free, chasing the crews through corridors (and flooded kitchens) until they die - or escape.Although the plot sounds fairly thin and silly, it is a strong story with a scary twist. The actors are all really good, Weaver puts in yet another excellent performance as Ripley, while newcomers to the series, Winona Ryder and Dan Hedaya, are both just as watchable. The screenplay is played out to ridiculous ends, which, in Alien: Resurrection's case, isn't actually a bad thing.If you like the Alien series and you're a big fan of sci-fi horror films, I highly recommend Alien: Resurrection.I rate Alien: Resurrection 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Another excellent film in a series of solid 10s,"Series note: It is strongly recommended that you watch this series in order, as each entry is a direct continuation of the story, as if chapters of a book. The previous films, in order, are Alien (1979), Aliens (1986), and Alien 3 (1992).Taking place 200 years after the events of Alien 3, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is now a clone living on a military ship as the subject of scientific experiments. Unfortunately, they also get a hold of specimen of the titular malevolent aliens. Shortly after a ship of ""space pirates"" docks to complete a deal with the military ship's shady General Perez (Dan Heyda), things start to go haywire, and once again, humans are fighting for their lives.Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet's series entry is most similar in tone to Aliens, James Cameron's action-heavy take on the alien mythology. The primary differences are those rooted to each film's place in time--Aliens is a typical mid-80s actioner, this is a typical late 90s actioner--and distinctions due to James Cameron's style versus Jean-Pierre Jeunet's, although in some ways, this is a more unusual film for Jeunet, who has leaned more towards surrealism and ""art films"" throughout his career.On the other hand, the script for Alien Resurrection, which was written by Joss Whedon (of television's Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel and Firefly fame), can be easily seen as more surreal than the other entries in the series, if not darker (the tone of Alien 3 makes it difficult to call anything darker). After all, Ripley is a clone here, there are lots of bizarre almost X-Files like government conspiracies and experiments going on, and on a subtextual level, the whole film is a very disturbing take on motherhood. So even though both Aliens and this film are primarily action flicks, there is less of a focus on firepower here, and more of a focus on sci-fi weirdness. I love both, so it's nice to have different films in the series with different focuses.We also get ""Super-Ripley"" in this film, which for me was a hoot. Sigourney Weaver was always one of the best things about the series--she presented a deep, intelligent, resourceful character, and in Alien Resurrection, she gets action hero-like physical prowess to boot. She is also able to add a slightly sinister, slightly inhuman edge, which brings a whole new dimension to the films. The rest of the characters were almost as enjoyably over the top as Cameron's Marines in Aliens. My only complaint on that end was that I would like to have seen both Brad Dourif and Dan Heyda much more.Jeunet gives us some of the more haunting scenes of the series, one of the best being an extended underwater trek through a flooded deck, as our heroes attempt to escape. Alien Resurrection's climax also features what very well may be the most disturbing creature in the series, and no, I'm not referring to Ron Perlman.It shouldn't take much to recommend this entry. You should have watched the first three films before you get here, and if you've watched that far (which surely means you've enjoyed the films more than not enjoyed them), you may as well check out the fourth, too. Don't forget to also see Alien vs. Predator (2004) after watching Alien Resurrection. It's of a similar quality to anything in either the Alien or Predator series.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"It's over man, game over man","The problem with Alien Resurrection wasn't the fact that it was a bad movie. The problem was that it never seemed to know what it wanted to be.  The thing that I loved about the previous movies was the fact that each movie, while a continuing story line, was a different vision.  Alien was a pure horror film.  Aliens was an action/war movie.  Alien3 was a gothic thriller. Alien Resurrection seems to be a cross between a modern slasher flick, a art house movie, and a slam bang blow-your-brains-out John Woo style action movie.Like all of the other Alien movies Resurrection's characters are both well defined and acted.  The scientists bored me, but I was both intrigued and entertained by the crew of the Betty.  Each member had their own distinct personality that didn't just seem like a clone from one of the previous movies.  I really liked the character of Analee Call, played adorably as always by Winona Ryder.  I think that if this series is to continue she is without a doubt the heir to the throne.  Call had an intriguing ""little girl in a world of big bad scary pirates"" thing going on, which was interesting. I also like Johner who was like a mix of all of the meanest characters of all the Alien movies thrown together.  He provided a good level of comic relief and managed the near impossible feat of being more frightening than the Aliens themselves are.All in all, Resurrection was neither a bad Alien movie nor a bad movie period.  It's worth a look if for nothing more than to look at Winona Ryder for a couple of hours7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A more than worthy sequel,"Despite being the fourth installment to the series, and thus being up against some pretty stiff competition, AND basically repeating a sequence of events we've already seen three times now, this movie succeed by having great storytelling and action, a believeable character gallery, superb acting from everyone involved, and adding just enough new twists.
Sure, getting it as perfect as the two first Alien movies is impossible for many reasons. First, if you're not Ridley Scott or James Cameron, then you're not Ridley Scott or James Cameron. Second, it has all been done before, and there is a limit to how many times Ripley can believably fight off these things. That's why it is very important to devote some time and effort into creating a believeable backdrop and motivation for her. Which I think all the sequels have done exceptionally well. Every time she is placed in the middle of the action against her will, this time actually being alive against her will.
If this happened to be the first Alien movie, many more would not think twice about giving it 10 stars.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"It's not Alien 4, it's a new beginning","I've always been surprised as to how much negativity Alien Resurrection has generated. Like its direct predecessor, it is a much maligned piece of cinema. Unlike Alien3, however, Resurrection doesn't descend further into the harrowing nightmare that ended with Ripley's death; it completely shifts the paradigms of the series.You could easily view this film as something apart from the previous three. It doesn't even have Ripley in it, not really- it's a clone (one of eight), and Sigourney Weaver doesn't play her like she's Ripley, either. Undeniably, they look similar these two protagonists, but that is pretty much the only link. Other than the blood-thirsty aliens stalking the corridors of a military space station- which itself finally delivers on the idea of what might happen should 'The Company' (or at least 'a company' since Weyland-Yutani are no more 250 years into the future) get hold of alien DNA and mess about with it. It raises some really interesting ideas about the nature of the creature itself (how, exactly, do you clone a parasite from the host's blood sample? That's a sci-fi concept waiting to be explored), not to mention their more 'human' aspects (problem solving intelligence, for one, an implied sexual interest in their genetic grandmother- Ripley 8) making for some pretty nasty monsters.That's the bad point really though, because ever since James Cameron took a load of machine guns to a colony of xenomorphs in 1986, they've lost the menace the creature had in the 1979 original. They are just teeth and claws to be dispatched, and perhaps it's intentional with regard to these aliens being a little bit human, but they look far too organic (they even seemed to have developed goat legs, which doesn't make such sense, but perhaps it's for artistic flare, and the creatures do look very good, just not as good as they used to).Alien Resurrection really isn't business as usual, but then every film in the series has been different, so why not have a European black comedy thrown in, too? Personally, I love Jeunet's touch; despite his language barriers at the time, he injects great humour into the proceedings, without ridiculing the hallowed science fiction saga, and that is thanks to Joss Wedon's script. He's been incredibly vocal about his disappointment with the project, but Jeunet's visual style lends itself incredibly well to science fiction, creating a grubby, dystopian future an age away from the clean white space station of Aliens and a darn sight more believable. If man as a species takes to the stars, the universe will be filthy, and that is on display here in abundance.There are some fantastic set pieces(although the underwater sequence's CGI has dated in the last 13 years), and a brave attempt at taking the series in a new and frightening direction with the love it/hate it (mostly people seem to hate it) Newborn creature, born directly from the (sadly under-used) Queen's womb inherited from the genetic crossover (so when do we get to see Ripley laying eggs?).Like Alien3 before it, it takes up the reigns from an ending nobody really knows how to develop the series from. Sure, it would have been nice that Hicks and Newt made it. And sure, it might have been nice if Ripley hadn't died- but this series has been taking risks since the beginning. Captain Dallas should have been the hero way back in 1979, but he buys it halfway in. Ridley Scott pulls a Psycho on us, and we love it. Every time anyone else tries anything against the grain in this franchise, it's been met with disdain. The most popular entry into the series (Aliens) is the least subversive, all guns and war and even a happy ending. It's a masterclass in scifi action, sure, but I think Alien Resurrection is probably the bravest film of the four. It sort of writes itself into a hole at the end, but we've been there before with this series. I'd like to know what could happen next.Bizarre, grotesque, frightening and equal parts hilarious, beautiful and bold, Alien Resurrection is a film that has been brutalised by fans and critics alike; even by those who made it. It takes risks, and the result is a subversive and entertaining b-move schlock-fest with European sensibilities and an incredible visual flare (like Fincher, it doesn't matter how much a studio suppresses the choices of Jeunet, his style is too powerful to be completely oppressed).Alien was horror. Aliens was action. Alien3 was foreboding drama. Alien Resurrection is outlandish, kinetic and occasionally insane science fiction. You should give it another chance. But I still don't know why the aliens are brown in this one.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Seems ironic now that a film with the word 'resurrection' in the title would ultimately kill off a series, but this Alien film does not deserve the reputation it carries.","I don't think it's that Alien: Resurrection is a bad film, just a film that pales in comparison when it comes to the mainstream's opinion of films that preceded it. But what films to have precede it; Ridley Scott's brilliant Alien, a film that helped pioneer that formula of the human, non-human and the anti-human archetype within a certain space together as events played out, more often than not the anti-human element 'jumping' out at you and picking off the hapless character. What happened in Aliens made everybody gush, some even more than Scott's effort and what happened in Alien¬≥ largely has everybody point fingers at the studio simply because it's a David Fincher film and he directed Fight Club and that's 'brilliant' thus; he cannot make a bad film which means it was the studio's fault.But biased opinions on directors, films and studios aside; Alien: Resurrection is a sort of hybrid of all three of the films, more so the first two than the third alone. As a film of the genre, it's relatively well paced with a host of characters that threaten to break into the anti-hero vein but all of whom are given their fair share of screen time and all of whom have their traits and quirks. This is a far cry from Cameron's Aliens, which is the worst of the quadrilogy in my opinion, which had a series of soldiers or space Marines or whatever all wear the same uniform, speak and act in the same manner and generally shoot and scream and panic their way out of obligatory action set pieces that would come along every so often.If Alien was a science fiction that fell into the horror subgenre, Aliens was a science fiction that fell into the war subgenre. Alien: Resurrection is a science fiction film that just teeters over into horror meaning its core is taken from Scott's film although it has the elements of war from the second instalment although we never feel the group of protagonists are fit or equipped enough to take on the group of Aliens because of lack of firepower. The film isn't as good as the first one but then again, given the set up Alien had let loose to filmmakers after its release, no film that had been made in the genre by this time was as good.Alien: Resurrection sees a band of space travellers land at the ship hosting events in this edition. Their timing of arrival co-insides with Alien series veteran Ripley (Weaver) getting cloned for the purpose of extracting the Alien queen inside of her by the nasty, greed driven guys in surgical suits. Little does everyone know, the ship is an experimentation lab of horror and soon their own fates will be rendered ambiguous when some of the Aliens break out. The set up sounds similar to the following year's Deep Rising, itself a film about a group of 'bad' people who hijack a large mode of transportation, that time it was a cruise liner on the open sea, just as the anti-human element of the piece decides to strike. Rest assured, it's a lot better than Deep Rising.So the set up is one thing but the real meat of the film sees these rouge space travellers, of whom include Ron Perlman's Johner and Winona Ryder's Annalee Call as well as heroine of the hour Ripley fight and fend their way off the ship to safety. This is where it could be argued the film slips into ""Aliens"" territory in the sense it's a bunch of characters on a ship, with guns, trying to get the hell out of there. So the question is, what's wrong with that? It's not as if the films descends into out and out chaos complete with choppy editing and dodgy one-liners, more so a more calm and drawn out exercise in travelling to a certain location and weathering the storm. The group must deal with underwater travel, the problem in dealing with a character in a wheelchair and how all these elements might affect them.But it's the character of Annalee Call that garners most of the attention, not least for the twist that arises to do with her. As a character, she is the voice of reason; she is the audience within the film, stating things and saying things aloud we might say or questions we might ask. At one point she stops Ripley from killing one of the ship's lab technicians after the grizzly hybrid findings in the laboratory; instead, she beat the official following Annalee's interruption and the audience perhaps feels relieved there is no blood shed between humans within the human prism of the human-nonhuman-antihuman triangle. Similarly, when it arises the ship automatically negates itself back to planet Earth following a revelation Annalee is there to once again announce, out loud that ""we should blow the ship up."" There's a beat between her (and us) hearing this information before her reacting during which time some audiences members might have already come to the conclusion she announces out loud.So while the film isn't brilliant, it is far from the disaster its reputation embeds it with. The film is a little bit of the previous three moulded into one but with a European director at the helm stamping his own mark on proceedings and allowing new ideas such as the hybrid monster at the end to step up. With hindsight, it's a far cry better than the path the producers took the franchise down most recently; that being Alien vs. Predator and more-so its respective sequel.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Entertaining if you like gore.,"I'd say it was pretty good.  Which is to say not very good, but entertaining.  The complexity the aliens needed was finally given to them, and the one liners that mar other action movies (cough, Van Damme, ahem) was not overdone, and actually worked with the movie.  But it was obvious who was going to die.  Isn't it always?  Anyway, it was gruesome, the special effects were great, and Sigourney Weaver is always good.

"A visual freak-show of a movie, in every sense of the word","Alien Resurrection is probably the most detested of the series by fans, I don't really know why. True, it's not great, the beauty of Jean-Pierre Jeunet and DP Darius Khondji's vision doesn't make up for the weak acting (what the hell is Winona Ryder doing here) or the laughable script, but Jeunet cannot make an uninteresting film. From Delicatessen (1991) right up to Le Fabuleux destin d'Am√©lie Poulain (2001) he's proven that his beautifully surrealistic visual can create a perverse sense of wonder and terror, and with Alien Resurrection he's in full swing.The film is a visual freak show in every sense of the word, full of bizarre mutations and characters, but the script just lets the film down. This seems to disregard the character of Ellen Ripley, I know she's a clone but they should of given her a little more emotion, think about what the poor woman went through. The scriptwriter Joss Whedon gives us no true hero; Ripley is a shell of her former self so we just don't care about her. To rap up, Alien Resurrection is a decent enough standalone film, but as part of the franchise, it's definitely the weakest.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Alien: Resurrection - Ripley, the Alien Queen Dons a Scalpel","Picture this: Ripley, resurrected 200 years after her fiery demise, thanks to some mad scientist DNA tinkering. Because in space, apparently, geneticists have nothing better to do. The result? A half-human, half-Alien Ripley who stares you down with a smirk that says, ""Care to test my acidic patience?"" It's a premise so out there it could've been a disaster. But then Jean-Pierre Jeunet steps in, turning this bonkers concept into a hypnotic sci-fi fever dream-complete with military experiments, dark humor, and buckets of ooze.This new Ripley isn't just back-she's transformed. With acid blood and a creepy connection to her xenomorph brethren, she's essentially Charles Xavier's worst mutant nightmare. Her newfound powers are a mix of ""Whoa!"" and ""Why?"" but Sigourney Weaver owns it like the queen she literally is. Balancing badass one-liners with an unsettling alien motherhood arc, she walks the fine line between humanity and monstrosity. Meanwhile, the xenomorphs are meaner, smarter, and more savage than ever, and watching Ripley navigate her evolving identity while taking them down is pure cinematic gold.The cast is a gloriously ragtag mix: Ron Perlman chewing scenery as a space brute, Dominique Pinon as the resident ""mechanic from hell,"" and Winona Ryder, adding a touch of ing√©nue-meets-enigma. This crew of morally gray space mercenaries didn't sign up for an alien rodeo, but their misadventures are wickedly entertaining. Darkly funny quips pepper the dialogue, making you laugh even as everything descends into slime-covered chaos.Jean-Pierre Jeunet slaps his unmistakable visual signature onto the Alien franchise. The result? A grim, visceral aesthetic, sprinkled with moments of twisted beauty. The underwater sequence, for instance, is a masterclass in tension and visual splendor. The practical effects hold up surprisingly well, and the sets-straight out of a deep-space fever dream-are as eerie as they are stunning.Of course, there are moments where you wonder if Jeunet might've had one too many glasses of Bordeaux before rolling the cameras. Case in point: the final act's grotesque alien newborn. Equal parts horrifying and absurd, it's impossible to look away, no matter how much you want to. But in this bizarre space opera, it somehow fits. Themes of identity, maternal instinct, and rogue science gone wrong are all woven together in a tapestry of controlled madness.Alien: Resurrection is the kind of film you watch with equal parts fascination and skepticism, only to find yourself hooked. Between Jeunet's lush direction, Weaver's electrifying performance, and xenomorphs that are more terrifying than ever, this entry injects a quirky, twisted energy into the franchise. It's not perfect, but it's a wild ride that deserves a second look. Watch it for the ""WTF but brilliant"" moments-you won't regret it.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A wholly pointless sequel,"Unlike some Alien fans, I was gripped by Alien3. I found it to be a very worthy and successful return to the claustrophobic low-tech horror feel of the first, classic Ridley Scott film. It was also an appropriate and dignified end to the series, I thought and to Ripley's character in particular.And so we thought the beast had been destroyed.I guess the money-men and suits in Hollywood did not agree.Sigourney Weaver must have been paid a hell of a lot to appear in this rubbish.When I heard there was to be a sequel with Ridley ""resurrected"", I thought that surely this was an empty cash-in on a great idea, dragged out beyond its natural course.As a great fan of the first three films of this series, the fourth in the franchise seemed redundant, unnecessary and quite frankly stupid and unappealing with stock characters and really inappropriate and distracting 'humour'. This was a long long way from the dark, intense Gothic masterpiece of the first in the saga. This was a cartoon of a crude kind, barren of ideas. A facsimile of a facsimile of a great idea.It added nothing to the already distinguished heritage of the series, and to my mind devolved an intriguing frightening sci-fi legend into the sort of B-movie cheesy nonsense that Alien could have been had not Ridley Scott and his team got their hands on Dan O'Bannon's original script.A backward step in all areas of film making.A sorry and shoddy end end to a great film franchise.One to miss if you love great films and the Alien legend.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fun film that does tackle some existential issues .....,"Alien Resurrection is very camp and funny compared to the dark tone of the first three films. The alien has penetrated into the resurrected Ripley. In fact, she is part alien. Ripley does not look tortured or depressed anymore. A quiet strength has replaced the ruthless pragmatism.The film does tackle some existential questions like in the exchanges between cloned Ripley and the robot played by Wynonda Ryder. I liked the part where Wynona asks Ripley - how do you go on living despite knowing what you are? Ron Perlman is a great addition to the cast. This film was pretty good fun what with the scenes of the aliens attacking underwater and all. More big budget films should try to be like this. I am sure a lot of people would disagree with my 8/10 rating. But nobody can deny the fact that it was an entertaining film.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Resurrected by Whedon,"While the first three installments were dark space creature tales stripped of all hope and mercy ""Alien: Resurrection"" changes the tone significantly. The fourth time around what we get is a sci fi actioner, a fun ride through space with aliens as a mere gimmick. Die hard alien heads might be unforgiving - and with good reason. If you don't care for the franchise but love yourself a gory laugh, you're in for a face hugging, chest bursting treat.The atmosphere has changed and here is why: The Ripley of A4 is not the Ripley we once knew - for the simple fact that she's dead. Weaver is actually playing Ripley's clone number 8, a clone with a xenomorphic vengeance. Her blood is acid, her powers are strong. Aliens won't touch her as they consider Ripley as one of them. So... where's the suspense when we needn't worry about the heroine? Clone number 8 doesn't worry about itself very much either. Instead of a deadly serious, protective female what we get is a cynical, indifferent thing with super powers. That's fun to watch, but is it frighting? Is it breath taking? Is it menacing? Nah...And then there's Dan Hedaya playing the boss of the space ship and the comic relief. But what it is he comically relieves us from is beyond me. His overacting is totally out of line and makes no sense, not even in Whedon's Alien universe. Good thing he's killed of quite soon.Then we're manipulated in falling for Winona's character. Don't. Not worth it.Ron Perlman and Leland Orser are mixing it up a little.But there was no moment I wasn't somehow entertained. Nice action, disgusting creatures and tons of fun action sequences kept me awake after a hard day at the office.If you know the feeling, you'll be able to enjoy this.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"simply made in the wrong year, achieved what giger would have wanted","I think this film just had the bad luck of being made a few years too early. I think the biggest draw back to this film was the use of CG which was still very much in its infancy. When you look at the story, and the writing this film is right up there with the rest of the films and seeing how the Alien DNA changes to creating something totally different actually gives a bit nod to the eventual Prometheus movie. On a different subject... Giger... I think this director captured Giger's true vision for how these creatures act... its a slightly erotic form of extraterrestrial violence that Giger illustrated in a large number of his works. And come on... Ron Perlman was f-ing amazing in this film. In the end I must urge you all to look at this film in context of all the films trying to use CG at the time. It wasn't quite ready for the big screen on the level that Jean-Pierre Jeunet was really hoping for.

Easily one of the weakest films in the Alien serious but that doesn't mean its bad film,"With this film I think Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (like all the other directors of previous Alien films) wasn't trying to create a film to match Alien or Aliens just a fun splatter film.it does introduce another new Alien to the universe with the Unborn Alien that many will question weather it is stupid or cleaver, either way Jean-Pierre Jeunet does give the universe something new instead of creating just another Alien action sci-fi horror film.One thing I was against was the use of CGI in the film. I strongly feel that when creating an Alien film that you should never present the aliens in CGI it just takes the whole horror of the creature away and leaves us with something embarrassing. even in the new Alien verses Predator films the aliens don't frighten people anymore because the CGI takes away that realism.Another new thing added to the ALIEN universe is that now the creatures can now swim underwater, being a STRONG lover of the Alien universe I still to this day find it hard to accept but then it was never discussed in any other film weather they could swim or not.The plot also was JUST acceptable although it does ruin the strength of the plot in alien 3, the dramatic ending now doesn't feel so dramatic because we now know she'll be cloned.However if your looking for a little sci-fi horror to wet your appetite or you if your a big fan of the Alien serious and wish to dive into the fourth installment then Alien Resurrection will be your next film to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The best one could do,"Well, this movie pretty much explores every interesting possibility left open by the first 3. The problem is however, that there are not that many left. Also there is the small issue, that Ripley died in the previous part (but in this kind of film logic is not an ingredient anyway).On the other hand, some ideas were pretty original and the half-Alien Ripley was interesting, even if it was obvious, which side she would join. Also, this film featured one of the coolest Macho-characters ever. ""What a waste of ammo - must be a chick thing.""",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
So close yet so far away....,"**SPOILERS**Allright, admittedly this film does not come close to the previous films. But I think that was the whole point, seeing as how each film in the series was directed by a different director each with their own vision of how the common threads of the series (Ripley and the Alien) were portrayed.""Alien"" had Ridley Scott working closely with H.R. Giger(whose design inspired the character) to bring something that audiences had never encountered before, which was a scifi horror with human elements (mainly brought by the character of Eleanor Ripley, brilliantly played by Sigourney Weaver). Scott wanted to give us an anticipated chill by portraying the alien as a killer who is barely seen, but when revealed is more terrifying than anything we've come to expect from horror genre, while elevating scifi to a new level. With the introduction of Ripley, we find ourselves empathizing with the character because she's so human and therefore fallible.""Aliens"" director James Cameron brought the action and SFX needed to give this series a jolt. In this one Ripley's just beginning to realize what has happened to her, but by setting it 57 years after the first one, becomes even more of a shock to the system. With her daughter dead, a mining colony on the same planet where the alien was found, we find her growing physically capable while slowly becoming emotionally detached. The addition of the marines (a group straight out of a Vietnam War pic), a sleazy lawyer (played neurotically but with an underlying menace by Paul Reiser), Bishop (the android at the opposite end of the spectrum for Ash in the first film) and Newt (who basically represents the daughter Ripley never had a chance to raise), Cameron adds the action portion while still containing the human elements we loved from the first film. Here Ripley has grown from a damsel-in-distress to a woman capable of handling an entire nest of these aliens, as well as introducing the Queen (an incredibly beautiful touch by Cameron on his part on the similarities between insect colonies/alien colony)), a complete turnaround from dealing with just one of them from the first film.David Fincher, the director of ""Alien3"", wanted to have that one lone menace from the first film, but redefining the series by setting it in an abandoned maximum security prison/lead works, run by the former prisoners (all men) of the facility. By putting Ripley in that testosterone-filled setting, he changed the rules. He even upped the ante by allowing the alien to carry on through other creatures, besides human, be hosts for it. By doing this, he gave the alien abilities and a new look by taking characteristics from it's host (the dog) and fusing them with the alien's capabilities. Fincher also brought to us the alien's POV, which had never been seen before in the series, and used it with great effect. And having Ripley as the host for the new queen was an unbelievable way to end the character because at that point, she had finally reached her full potential. The analogy of Ripley (the strong capable leader) and a queen alien being inside her was just perfect, and having them both die together while Ripley flings herself into the lead works becoming essentially a saviour/martyr of the remainder of humanity was a great way to end the story.Finally I come to ""Alien: Resurrection"", which must be treated as a separate film with the common threads of the series, Ripley and the alien. Director Jean-Pierre Jeune brought to us the fantastic visual style that made his last effort, ""La Cit√© Des Enfants Perdus (The City of the Lost Children)"" such a cult classic. But by doing this, it weakened the expectations of the audience, who hoped to see the same old Ripley vs. Alien scenario, which in this case would not have worked, seeing as how the character of Eleanor Ripley had died in the last film. Sigourney Weaver decided to play the new Ripley as a being with inherited memories of Ripley's, but also sharing alien characteristics (acidic blood, fast reflexes, healing and heightened strength). In this way the character becomes almost like a double agent of humanity and the aliens, leaving you wondering whose side she's on, and depending on certain parts of the film, leaves you guessing. The new elements of the military experimentation, pirates (with Winona Ryder as Call, an emotional android capable of being humane) and the sense of humor brought to the table by Ron Pearlman and Dominique Pinon's characters are surprisingly enjoyable, but a far cry from what we know of the series. And yes I thought the ""Newborn"" indeed repelling, but I also felt sympathetic towards it because of it's emotional state (not sure who to trust and how to handle being what it is, almost as if it were a newborn puppy). And with aliens actually heading for Earth, which the first three films were aiming toward by preventing such a thing to happen, that brought an adrenaline kick to the film. The ambiguity of the ending left me wondering where the series might be headed.Final analysis? ""Alien: Resurrection"" may not be on par with the earlier films, but as a scifi/horror/action film, it holds it's own. I give it a rating of 7 out of 10, minus three for plot elements and acting.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great movie, if only they'd have cut out the last 15 minutes.","I loved this movie. Nice sets, camera works and of course special effects. It's more of an action movie then a horror. But that's ok, because it's one of the best action movies i've ever seen. There's only one thing that made this movie a 7 instead of a 10, the last 15 minutes or so. I won't tell what it is that's so bad about it, let's just say the movie would have been better if they would all have died before it all happened.

A sorry ending,"I never liked Joss Whedon and this movie is another example as to why. First off I can not treat this movie as it's own. The series brought us a powerful and memorable heroine and a frightening and memorable villain. You can't separate the films apart. They are forever linked with those characters and thus they are to be scrutinized in comparison between them. Saying that I am sorry Alien Ressurection was made.What made Ripley who she is in the Alien series? Obviously Whedon had no clue whatsoever and went ahead to change her character into this blasphemous Terminator-like hero. I for one didn't like this change. It's because she is human, succumbed to emotions, and most of all AFRAID of the unexpected and the horrific nightmares these creatures wrought upon her that made Ripley... Ripley. Turning her into an Alien is a novelty, and I suppose what they were trying to accomplish was an ironic and cruel twist of fate tossed to her. The thing that has haunted her for so long she becomes. Unfortunately, the performance wasn't convincing and we end up hating this new persona. Blame it on the script.Visually this fourth installment is pretty much what we have been experiencing over and over again with the series. Again, they try to reproduce that claustrophobic experience Aliens gave us with the tight corridors, the running out of time factor, etc. Some of the humor in the movie was unnecessary and bland. The General saluting after destroying an alien, then gets killed by one but not before going through a few gestures which screams comedy, was insulting to the series. I will never understand european humor.Anytime you're given a franchise, you'll love to excercise all possible storylines. Since it's already had it's success, you have a greater margin for error. What Whedon gave us is a plot thin as a wet tissue, and full of holes to see through. There was little explaining of anything, which could be a good thing. A script this messy how much more can it get if you let them explain it. What plot was there, was for the aliens to be shot at, destroyed, a character dies in between, and more aliens die. It's getting old, and so is this series. Thumbs down.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not perfect, but plenty of fun","The fourth in the original series of movies is not as good as the first two but far better than the dull third.Set 200 hundred years after Ellen Ripley (Weaver) died, here we have a mutated version of Ripley who is being tested on with the Alien inside her. They take the Alien out of her (BAD IDEA), and do tests with that (ANOTHER BAD IDEA).Arriving at the base are a bunch of mercenaries led by Ron Perlman (always great to watch). Amongst his crew are Dominique Pinon and Winona Ryder, who are the other cast members worth mentioning.With the Aliens loose on the ship, it's a race against time for the dwindling crew to escape.It's an enjoyable ride with plenty of great action scenes to please the sci fi fans.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Slightly Upset,"Well just to some up my reaction of the movie... the plot it decent, and it builds it up so much, but the ending doesn't give the build up any justice. the CGI was decent, but the worst part was the Hybrid Alien. I think the looks of it was retarded. I think they should have came up with a different concept for the human/alien hybrid. Other then that, i think Winona Ryder's character, the new cyborg was cool, also the bad ass ripley and the crew of pirates. Hopefully the series doesn't end on such a low note and they come out with Aliens vs. Predator which is a dope concept already, they just have to make it",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alien: Resurrection,"Oh boy. Here it is, the worst Alien film out there. If you really did not like Alien 3, (I liked it) then you will be very dissappointed with Alien: Resurrection. Alien: Resurrection was made in response to the mostly negative feedback of Alien 3. The film had several problems finding a director and even figuring out the best way to end the film. Another problem was trying to get Sigourney Weaver to come back for another film and they did because ""she liked the script"". The film was released in 1997, five years after Alien 3. The film was directed by French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet and with a screenplay written by Joss Whedon who is known for writing The Avengers. The film did alright at the box office (by no means the highest grossing film) by making $161.4 million against a $70 million budget. The film got mostly mixed to negative reviews (and strangely has a higher score on the Tomatometer than Alien 3) thus making any hopes for a sequel to the film unlikely.It is 200 years after the events of Alien 3 and we see that military scientists have cloned the famous Ellen Ripley (still not entirely sure why they waited 200 years but alright). They do this in hopes of being able to clone the Alien that was inside her (and I am not sure if that would work either). The military has a bunch of these Aliens that they are using to study and what appears to be them bringing the Aliens to Earth. Some space pirates come on board the ship and some Aliens escape and Ripley (who has some Alien DNA inside her) must decide to either help the humans or not.Let's get this out there. Alien: Resurrection is bad. The first time I watched this film, I was mad at the complete shift in tone from the previous films. This film comes out more as comedic than dark and serious like the previous films and I honestly believe that that is the intention. Well, it is a dumb intention. If Alien was the horror film, Aliens the action film, Alien 3 the melodrama, then Alien: Resurrection is most definitely the comedy. Everything from the laughable dialogue, to just some completely absurd scenes. Wanna see Ellen Ripley play some basketball? Well, this film has it. But, with that aside, there are some serious moments in this film. For example, the cloning room with the failed Ripley's is truly a good scene if you are looking for something that matches the tone of the previous films. But the problem is is that scenes like that add nothing to the story and can easily be removed from the film which is a bummer. If you are also looking for scenes that attempt to match the tone of the previous films then anything scene where a character is by themselves and everything is quiet. A great call back but the problem is is that the overall tone drowns out the other scenes. While there are more Aliens in this film than in the previous film, they just are not scary in this film. Even the Queen Alien who really does nothing much in this film. And yes, there is a Alien hybrid. (That is Alien and human mixed together). First of all, it comes off more as cute and not scary. Alien: Resurrection has a lot of unique and possibly interesting ideas, but they do not add up to much at all. One thing that Alien: Resurrection manages to do somewhat better than Alien 3 is giving characters charisma. Sure, they are not written well but they sure have lots of charisma that makes some of them pretty likeable. They are most definitely not the bald headed men that were in Alien 3. This is probably my least favorite incarnation of Ripley in this film. Yes, I am aware that she is not the same and yes, I am completely aware that she is part Alien. But her actions just come off as uncomfortable. (Rubbing face and all that? No thanks.) Ron Perlman is lots of fun in this film along with a few others (but not Winona Ryder). The practical effects are really good here in this film and there are several instances which have really good practical effects. This film has some of the best kills/gore in any Alien film. Want a frozen nitrogen death? You got it! The CG is pretty obvious here but I won't say it was awful. Much like in my review of Independence Day, the effects might have been good for the time, but now is not that time.Alien: Resurrection fails to be better than Alien 3 (but I somewhat liked that film). The film loses me with the complete change in tone from what was previously a dark and suspenseful film, to a comedic, popcorn flick. It is entertaining to watch, but for die hard fans, this sequel will most likely dissappoint.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

"The brainless, violent monster movie that it is.","My Take: While not the best in the ALIEN saga, this fourth chapter brings along action-packed thrills fans found lacking in ALIEN 3.(This is an extension of the review I wrote in February 2007)Fans consider ALIEN: RESURRECTION as a remedy after the doom-filled and much-maligned ALIEN 3. After all, after much of the pulp has already been juiced, it's only appropriate that this fourth ALIEN film declines to a mindless monster movie of the summer. Under those warrants, ALIEN: RESURRECTION gives you your end of the bargain.""Alien: Resurrection"" is a good film. Lets not say excellent, but still a very good entry in the series. Sure, it does some things that should have ended in the previous chapter, but still makes up for it. The Ripley here is a clone, bred by scientists who plot to exploit and study the alien creatures. Okay, the film doesn't explain how they got Ripley, or the alien queen inside her (she supposedly burned in boiling lava in the previous chapter). But hey, those are somethings only sci-fi can answer. Anyway, the main attractions are those mean green mothers from outer space, slimier than ever. And then there's Weaver, returning to her competent, female Rambo, able to widen her characteristics when given the chance to make Ripley (or clone Ripley) a meaner and more complicated critter.Overall, not the series' best, but it's definitely the best movie gross-out carnage and slimy monsters has got to offer.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Perfect symmetry in how utterly wrongheaded both the real and fictional attempts to keep things alive were; awful script and direction, unappealing characters and inept humor all contribute to this pointless debacle.The first two ""Alien"" pictures are still masterpieces, fun-house and roller-coaster rides reflected darkly and grotesquely by the next two; let's hope the planned fifth solo ""Alien"" film rectifies this situation!",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
No more character...,"Of the four, this may be the poorest simply because of character. The body of the cast has very little development, but the big problem is Ripley. She's just not herself anymore - she doesn't have the same drive as she did in the first three. For Resurrection we return to the typical run for your life format. In This case, its the humans trying to get off the ship before they're all made into lunch or hosts. Aliens pop up all over the place, and we're granted some brief, bloody moments. My real appreciation lies in the CG aliens - this advantage, however briefly seen, allowed the aliens to be more insectoid, and saves a costume budget. Granted, there are bonuses to having a physical alien suit, but for sheer realism, an uncostumable physique works better for the aliens.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"OUTSTANDINGLY GOOD SciFi, well written continuation to 3 with a gut/heart-wrenching ending",This is easily the best 'Alien' movie since the original. The screen imagery is superb and quite believable with excellent furturistic settings that appear to work fluently. The storyline makes a very good attempt of continuing after the all but final self-immolation scene at the end of 'Alien3'. There is a gut & heart-wrenchingly brilliant and at the same time sad ending. Needs watching twice to gather the full impetus of the film. The only slight criticism I could think of is that one or two of the jokes are a bit trite and come at the wrong time but that could be due to the director being French !,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
My Eyes Still Burn From The Pain -- What A Horrible Film,"Oh, what a rancid waste of film.  Alien: Resurrection is pure garbage, plain and simple.  The dialogue is awful, the acting is awful, the plot . . . well, if there actually was a plot, it would've been awful, but since one never existed, it's a moot point.  Yet again, humanity is being threatened by the Alien menace, and since humanity has apparently spent the 500 years between Alien3 and Alien: Resurrection doing nothing but picking the collective lint out of its navel, scientists decide to clone the charred remnants of Ripley into an ultimate Alien killing machine.  Of course, these same geniuses somehow don't notice that they've alos included some Alien DNA in their new Ripley clone, making her equally dangerous to both humanity and Aliens alike.  Gratuitous, badly directed combat scenes ensue.Sigourney Weaver gets to chew some scenery by playing the Ripley clone, who's far more aggressive and violent that the Ripley of past Alien films. At least she was fun to watch, even if the character made absolutely no logical sense.  And then there's the latest android/human fascimile of the series . . . Winona Ryder, as Annalee.  Hee, hee; she's unwatchably bad. She pouts and whines her way through the film, trying to act tough but ultimately looking nothing short of pathetic.  Bring back Lance Henrickson as Bishop.  Hey, bring back Ian Holm as the homicidal Ash, at least he'd be better than Ryder.  How Winona Ryder got into this film will probably go down as the greatest mystery of the Twentieth century; she's THAT bad.About the only saving grace of the film are the sets, which faithfully recreate the moods and claustrophic creepiness of ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" . . . unfortunately, by reminding you of those films, you're also constantly reminded of how bad ""Alien: Resurrection"" really is.

Solid entertainment!,"With Resurrection, we finally get to have fun with both the story and the characters, thanks in large part to fine performances by Sigourney Weaver, Winona Ryder, and Ron Perlman. A French director puts a different spin on the storytelling and makes the movie much more entertaining. In the special edition, there's a funny new opening scene and an even better ending, along with added scenes which go a long way towards making this a better movie.

Disappointing despite creative effort,"The action scenes are well thought out and there's plenty of gore. But it lacks character and suspense, it gets kind of formulaic.Joss Whedon has written plenty of good scripts for both movies, TV shows as well as comics and this is definitely not his worst. It's a bit more creative than it's predecessor Alien 3, but the characters have less depth. The film is also more uneven, switching from action flick to surreal and gross splatter film, the wisecracks getting in the way of real suspense.Winona Ryder does her part but it's not as memorable as Lance Henriksen's. Her character as well as some others were more grotesque than engaging. Also I don't find this Sigourney Weaver's best performance, while it was refreshing for herself, playing an alien-human clone, she wasn't as likable because she seemed to care less about the fate of humankind. Like in Alien3, the problem was again that you can't really care much about any of the characters. And too many of them make it out alive this time.It was missing the human element as well and that was one thing Alien3 did better as well as the classic ones, Alien and Aliens.Still, plenty of entertainment and not boring for a moment.

adventures into surrealism,"If one thing can be said about Jeunet's direction of this film, it is that he has an uncanny visual sense of the alien (no pun intended) and surreal. From Ripley's weird little body movements into which she occasionally lapses to the makeup and costume design of the human/alien hybrid at the end of the film, this is one visually trippy experience.The cast is pretty good -- with stand-outs being Sigourney Weaver (the ultimate femme bad-ass), Brad Dourif (the weird and crazy alien-obsessed doctor), and Michael Wincott (the surly yet likeable captain of the spaceship Betty). Unfortunately, though, Joss Whedon (whose Buffy TV series is about the only reason I miss having a boob-tube) really screws up the script. He never allows the characters to breath, constantly forcing them to spit out stupid one-liners in practically every scene.Additionally, the plot is nothing we haven't seen before in this series and offers little to keep us guessing. Overall, it's a decent effort, though one must wonder how much better it could have been in the hands of a more capable script-writer.FINAL RATING: 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Rewatching Alien: Resurrection is a bit of a strange experience. After the critical backlash and box office drop from Alien 3, you wouldn't have been crazy to think the franchise might be done for good. But of course, Fox couldn't resist reviving one of their most popular properties, and so the series-and its star, Sigourney Weaver-were brought back to life. With Weaver getting a hefty payday to return as Ripley, they clearly wanted to breathe new life into the series. Interestingly, Weaver does get to explore a different side of the character, which is at least something fresh, even if the film itself is a bit of a mess.The supporting cast does a decent job, with Ron Perlman standing out as the gung-ho tough guy, Johner. He adds some much-needed entertainment to the film with his gritty, no-nonsense approach. But then there are the odd comical elements sprinkled throughout the movie that just don't sit right. Dan Hedaya, in particular, finds himself in some downright ludicrous situations that clash with the darker tones of the story. Brad Dourif doesn't escape the awkwardness either, as his character's quirks feel forced rather than naturally unsettling.Jean-Pierre Jeunet, known for his quirky French films, brings his distinct style to the table, but it often clashes with the horror elements. There are moments when his art-house approach to scene composition and dark humour create a unique atmosphere, but more often than not, it feels jarring. The tone is all over the place, making it hard to take the scares seriously or invest in the characters.The finale, like much of the film, is ambitious but doesn't quite land. There's an interesting concept at play, but it never fully realises its potential. In the end, Alien: Resurrection feels like a film that's trying to do too much at once and doesn't quite succeed at any of it. It's watchable, but definitely the weakest link in the series.FORMAT: Blu-rayVIDEO: 8.0

Not that scary,"As a fan of the series (especially ""Aliens""), I was mildly disappointed in ""Alien: Resurrection"". Mildly, because what can you expect from a third sequel. For some reason this movie is not scary. It's gory and visually quite impressive, but still it doesn't make you feel the excitement it should as a part of the ""Alien""-series. And it is way too gory. I think we could have done well without the scenes where the aliens demonstrate their bloody ways to kill people. I mean that the earlier movies had already pretty much established the horrible way these creatures treat their victims.As I said the movie is visually quite impressive, but in this case it does work out right. I'd say the computer generated aliens look great, but not real enough. And they shouldn't be shown so much. They would be much more scary they were more ""mysterious"" as in the earlier movies.The story line and the characters are basically OK, but still the movie seems a bit too ambitious in trying to make it sell. But still, it is a must for the fans of the series, because it doesn't spoil the series in any way.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The second best in the series.,This movie was really cool. I saw it at the theaters when it came out on Thanksgiving. I didn't really like it that much. I thought it was ok but not as good as Alien3. I rented it when it came out on video. I was blown away. I really liked it and I didn't know why I didn't like it at the theater. The f/x were really good. The ships and explosions looked cool. The plot was good. It had to deal with Ripley being cloned to get the alien out of her that was in her in the third movie. The action sequences were really good. The part where they are in the water trying to swim to a room had me on the edge all the way through. The aliens looked really cool this time. The newborn looked really scary.

Third Favorite Alien Film ... But it's a Really Good Franchise,"Not as atmospheric/claustrophobic as Ridley Scott's ""Alien"", not as action packed as James Cameron's ""Aliens"" and not as introspective as David Fincher's ""Alien 3"", but its probably second in each of these categories which makes it a satisfying if not original or entirely successful.The film comes across a little disjointed in its feel which could be the result of struggles between a behemoth Hollywood studio and a French art film director. There are some amusing interspersed with scenes of all out action. The performances are strong if lacking any real standout's. And the special effects are very good.Both Ron Perlman and Dominique Pinon have appeared in previous films for Jeunet who really does seem to have a taste for unique faces which he also gets from Brad Dourif.Jeunet has made two much better films, Delicatessen and the brilliant Amelie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Decent 4th installment I guess,"I was not that crazy about this movie. I am in the process of binge watching all eight of them. This is the fourth one I've seen and so far my least favorite. I'm not saying it was a bad movie.What I do like about the series is the continuity between all of the movies. They all seem to float together nice and carry on the same plot as the previous one. They did not try and change out the formula too much like a lot of other movie series would've done.I did not like the new hybrid alien. They did not do a great job, explaining how it came to be. Also, the people trapped in the cocoon things were acting strange. Why? That confused me.I guess this is the last one of the main series. I'm looking forward to watching the prequel's and not so much looking forward to the alien versus predator movies.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A truly awful Alien movie,This film makes Alien 3 look good. One word for Alien Resurrection  - GARBAGE. The Alien series stopped at Aliens - forget 3 and especially this last feeble effort. Full of wise-cracks/unnecessary gore and very little suspense - then how could you generate suspense about an Alien species that by then we knew so much about. This film should never have been made. My advice is to buy the original on DVD.,3.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Aliens vs. their worst enemy; commercionalism,"Although there are some pretty poignant scenes in here, and this is overall quite enjoyable to watch, it suffers from quite a few flaws of a typical Hollywood (i.e stupid) big-budget late 90's action thriller flick; rather corny dialogue that fails to be properly witty and over-uses a rude word that rhymes with ""duck"" every two minutes, an overall plot that often seems too far-fetched and flimsy to take seriously (although everyone on-screen pretends they do), a general balance of brawn over brains in the form of tacky computer-made special effects, and over-milkage of one annoying little movie star (Winona Ryder in this case, who manages to be genuinely irritating. Her character Call is a screen-hogging nuisance as well).Nevertheless, this is entertaining enough to watch, with lots of shooting, some pretty strong horror moments directed with decent flair and of course, the Alien monicker to back it up. The big problem is that many will feel that the Alien franchise deserves much better than this, which feels way too teenager-oriented. And there's no denying that the first three Alien films are streets ahead of this both for style and substance.So not an absolute travesty, but not quite worthy of the big name of the Alien films either.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Enough Already!!!!!,"When I went to go and see this movie, I had very high expectations.  But I left the theatre feeling a little misinformed.  I'll be blunt about this movie: It sucks!  I mean, who in the right mind would go see this movie twice?  I hope Sigourney Weaver is kicking herself right now.  'Aliens' is by far the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life!  It's the best! But this just spoils it.  The acting stinks, the aliens stink, the plot line stinks, even the action is missing.  What I find odd, is that so many people die in the movie, but yet, there is hardly any action at all!  And I ask you, where have we seen creatures grown in a lab, put in a cage, and then they escape and go on a rampage before?  Don't think too hard!  You might hurt your brain and end up like the writers for this movie!",,Anonymous,Horror
Better than Alien 3,"I will say that alien resurrection is better than its predecessor, Alien 3. But it is not nearly as great as aliens, no other Alien movie will be, because it is incredible in ever way. This movie once again, stars Sigourney weaver, and co stars Winona Ryder. I really loved Winona Ryder here, I loved her character and how she played that character. Sigourney is good here as usual, well, her character is very different in this final movie, Ripley is a clone, the real human Ripley is of course dead. So, at the beginning, I wasn't really enjoying her character because she is just so empty and hollow. But as the movie goes on, her character gets better and becomes more real, which is good. The action here is pretty good, again, it'll never compare to aliens, but it's still pretty nice. If you cannot stand gore, then you may wanna think twice about seeing this movie, or see it edited, the bloodshed in this film is a good bit stronger than in the previous ones. I do think they took the goriness too far in a few scenes towards the end. But I did love the ending, the newborn was very cool looking and I think the effects were very good looking during the birth scene, the effects throughout were nicely done. But dealing with the birth scene in particular, the effects NEEDED to be top notch, and they definitely were, that scene was just very cool looking and interesting. So overall, the acting is pretty good, the writing suffices, and the action/effects work. Not the best in the franchise, but certainly not the worst. 7/10 for alien resurrection.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than expected: As good as hoped?,"Perhaps it had something to do with Alien3 - a badly shot, confused film set in what looked like a large Victorian Toilet. But I went to see the (apparently) last installment of the Alien series with no expectations whatsoever.Better than expected:The Ripley of Resurrection is - in a word - dangerous. Her character changes quite a few times dring the film, from brooding to laconic to furious to distraught to plain nasty: all with an undercurrent of something menacing beneath the surface, like a dorsal fin on a heavy sea. This is the best performance that Sigourney has ever done in the entire series. Her support is also quite good - from the Gucci-ceries carrying a hijacked crew in suspended animation to use as carriers for the Alien young to the Conscienceless Scientists and Military aboard the Warship. And now to the important part - The Aliens themselves. After the god-awful obviously computer animated alien of the last film, we are finally back into Geiger-esque territory - and none too soon. The Alien warriors have undergone yet more modifications. They are more streamlined and inhuman looking. More importantly they move in a realistic fashion which does'nt look as if the camera was merely overcranked. (They're a bit more intelligent also!) The genetic prequels to a successful Ripley were Truly horrific and the discovery of the same was one of the few moments in film that have honestly put a shiver down my back. The storyline was a tad simplistic but perhaps that was for the best, with fewer gaps showing and allowing the film to progress at a fluid pace.As good as hoped?No. But considering the impact and flavour of the original film, (which despite the effects looking dated today, it is still the most powerful and believable film of the four) I certainly was not disappointed - In fact I think I'll see it again - Soon.Dan",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Let sleeping dogs lie?,"Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, the makers here basically stick safe to the formula of the series. This time it's a space station with space pirates and a cloned Ripley (Siggy Weaver of course) - yes! A cloned Ripley, only this time she's devoid of human compassion - kind of... The gore quota is significantly upped, which makes for some serious sci-fi terror, and some of the imagery crafted is outstanding (a clone lab sequence is shatteringly unforgettable). A tip top cast featuring Ron Perlman, Michael Wincott, Brad Dourif, Dan Hedaya and Winona Ryder, all give good shows, whilst the photography (Darius Khondji/Se7en) and art design (Steve Cooper, Andrew Neskoromny and John M. Dwyer) takes the breath away. Yet come the final straight it loses its way, sinking into a mire of over confidence, topped by a crown of thorns involving an albino baby alien hybrid.

The final resurrection? Lets hope so!,"Not another bad review, well yes.I was in the minority of people that enjoyed Alien 3, yes it was flawed but it tried something different & in the final scene the Alien saga was brought to a fitting conclusion. It also didn't resort to ripping off the death-by-airlock idea from the original which was stolen for the sequel. The fourth instalment again has a variation on the originals ending but this is not the greatest of its crimes. It is set for some unknown reason 200 years after Alien 3. I say unknown as neither the sets or the hardware reflect any significant advancement from the other films in the franchise. Yet again we have blokes with guns running through industrial pipe n smoke filled corridors but these individuals we neither care for or understand. They are sketchy characters at best, cliched bad guys with ricocheting bullets & other comic book tricks. This whole film is like a cartoon version of Alien aimed at the MTV generation. This is not surprising considering it was scripted by Joss Whedon. If you wade through the dross there is the hint of a good film in here. Bringing Ripley back was really the only thing they could do as an Alien film without her would be even worse (is that possible). The Ripley clone with Alien characteristic is an enticing idea but one that is wasted here. Maybe she should have been the bad guy, the Alien species absent? The scene in which she destroys here clone 'sister' was what I thought would be a turning point for the movie but alas this was not to be. Now we come to this films crowning glory the woeful, laughable alien/human hybrid. What on earth was that THING? Were the designers actually proud of creating this? What did they think an audiences reaction to it would be other than laughter? A truly terrible climax to a terrible film.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Slightly underrated,"While Alien Resurrection would seem like a POS compared to Alien-1 and Aliens, by itself, its not such a bad movie. The special effects are top notch for the most part but the producers blundered badly by including CGI aliens in some scenes, which look totally fake and stupid. There's really little or no element of horror and not too much action but most parts were fairly realistic and the film did have its moments. The use of gore makes the aliens fairly effective. The characters were most entertaining and likable. An entertaining movie, probably much more entertaining than Alien-3 and a billion times better than the crappy filth called AvP, but cannot be taken seriously like Alien and Aliens.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Complete Waste of Time and the millions it had cost,"This movie generally sucks in very aspect except for the really nice photography by Darius Khondji. The script is so unlogical. If you clone a pregnant woman, than her baby would definitely not be copied too. But the worst thing in the script are the completely nauseating characters. Winona Ryder (a very good actress in other films) is completely miscast as an action-heroine. Ron Perlmans character is completely unbearable and destroys even the last moment of atmosphere. Also weak is John Frizzells score, which is the absolutely boring standard-shocker music with high string tremolos and stomping percussions, the other 3 movies had great scores. And the worst part of it all: this movie doesn't even scare you. Instead of well build tension you get gore, gore, gore- my fantasies are much more frightening then liters of film blood. I give it a 1 out of 10, because Jeunet really failed in keeping up the high quality of the series (yes, i also liked Fincher's take on the beast, although you can feel, that it was heavily cut by the studio.) And now, there are rumours about a fifth ALIEN-movie directed by Ridley Scott. Chances are high, that this will get better than Jeunets ""achievement."" But then, it really has to end, the series had sequels enough.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great talents combine to make great sci-fi,"Alien: Resurrection is the finest component of the series since the original.  The well-paced script by Joss Whedon (of Buffy fame) provides both humor and pathos.  Director Jeunet reproduces the visual genius of Delicatessin and City of Lost Children, aided by his veteran colleague, D.P. Darius Khondji, who washes the entire set with a metallic grey hue. Outstanding performances all around highlight the struggle between man and beast (as exemplified by the new, hybrid Ripley).  Watch for great animalistic portrayals by Sigourney Weaver and Ron Perlman and the Winona Ryder's ""mechanical"" characterisation.  Fans of Buffy will recognize Whedon's playful wit (keep an eye out for Perlman snagging the gun from a soldier guarding him, then returning the weapon with a warning not to touch him).  Fans of Jeunet's prior and later work (e.g. Amelie) will recognize the atmosphere and sudden shifts between extremes.  Finally, any sci-fi fan will get caught up in the fast-paced action and original gore.",,Anonymous,Horror
"It doesn't need to exist, but it is more entertaining than Alien 3","200 years after Ellen Ripley sacrificed herself to eliminate the Xenomorph threat, her DNA has been acquired by the United Systems military. On board a United Systems medical research ship on the edge of space, the Auriga, Ripley-8 (Sigourney Weaver), a clone of Ripley made from hybridized Xenomorph DNA with Ripley's DNA has spawned a Xenomorph queen. As the experiments continue, a team of mercenaries on board the ship, the Betty, delivered abducted stasis pods for the Auriga to use in their Xenomorph experiments, however one of the mercenaries, Call (Winona Ryder), has a motive to take down the Xenomorph research.While critical reception to Alien 3 more tepid in comparison to Alien and Aliens, it still made enough especially internationally that Fox hired Joss Whedon to write the script for the film. Initially intended to focus on a clone of Newt, this was changed after Fox executives determined Ripley was the ""Anchor"" of the series. Weaver had wanted the character not to become a ""figure of fun"" who'd wake up every movie killing aliens and this along with the prospect of an Alien vs. Predator film were instrumental in Weaver's goal of killing off the character in the third film. Weaver was however intrigued by the take on a new version of Ripley with divided loyalties being both human and Xenomorph and returned for an $11 million salary. Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet was hired as director following his work on cult hit City of the Lost Children and filming began with a $70 million budget. While the film made only about $47 million in the United states, it was quite successful in the rest of the world earning $160 million and encouraging Whedon to write an Earth set sequel that ultimately wasn't made due to Weaver's feeling the script wasn't adequate. Alien Resurrection again doesn't reach the mark of Alien or Aliens, but it is much better than the theatrical cut of Alien 3 and does do some interesting things with the series formula.Per usual for a Jean-Pierre Jeunet film, Alien Resurrection is quite a beautiful movie with Jeunet's ambition with visual marvels ever present. The Auriga is quite a visually impressive ship with its labyrinthian innards being simultaneously alluring and off putting and Jeunet and his team put together some really impressive setpieces together, particularly an underwater sequence with the Xenomorph's that feels like a unique sequence we've not seen before. The design for the aliens is well done with the new takes on the alien queen and the ""newborn"" as it's called nicely disgusting with some very unnerving bits in the last third of the film.Ripley-8 is well played by Sigourney Weaver as this rough facsimile of a human being who rests somewhere between human and alien and that duality present in the character gives Weaver a bit more meat to chew on performance wise than she had in Alien 3. The movie also builds out its supporting cast with Winona Ryder, Ron Perlman, and Brad Dourif bringing their charisma to the film and creating a more engaging set of characters in comparison to the pious and overly reserved prisoners of the last film. The characters never match the level we saw in Alien or Aliens, but at least they feel engaged. Aside from that, this is really just another Alien movie with most of the things you've come to expect still there and even though the movie tries to play Ripley-8 as a possible threat it never really comes across that way on camera and feels like it could've been further developed.Alien Resurrection is fine as far as the series is concerned. Weaver is still good playing Ripley, Jeunet brings his visual style on display, and the ensemble is more interesting and engaging than they were in the last film, but it's undeniable the series has settled into formula and is struggling to keep itself fresh. It's got everything you've come to expect from this series and delivers it well, but that's about all I can give it.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Maybe the Franchise Should Have Died with Ripley Back in 1992,"Here is the third direct sequel in the ALIEN franchise and, by this point, the series has all but completely lost the essence of the original. The film, directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, contributes nothing new to the series aside from better quality visual effects and a reason (albeit, a weak one) to resurrect Ellen Ripley. The film occurs 200 years after the events on Fiorina 161 and the military has used DNA samples from the impregnated Ripley to cultivate a Queen. Things get out of control and Ripley bands together with the crew of the unregistered freighter BETTY to escape alive. Whereas David Fincher's ALIEN 3 almost seemed to hearken back to the horror/suspense vibe of Ridley Scott's original, this film seems to aim more towards the man versus alien action of James Cameron's ALIENS. Unfortunately for Jeunet's film, it doesn't come close to matching the awesomeness that was Cameron's film.This installment feels hollow and meaningless compared to the previous. Instead of focusing on interesting characters or claustrophobic paranoia, the movie feels more focused on the deaths as the aliens one-by-one pick off the survivors. The only scene with any real impact behind it is Ripley's discovery of the seven failed clone attempts that came before her, and the horror of confronting mutilated versions of herself (while showing her only instance of humanity in the entire film). Otherwise, it's just a paint-by-numbers survival horror film...a two hour period where you watch the survivors get dropped into situation after situation where someone is bound to die. As for the ending, I'm not all that keen on it. The conclusion involves an unforeseen result of the cloning process: Ripley has developed minor traits similar to the aliens (acidic blood, heightened senses and reflexes) and the Queen has developed human traits, namely a uterus that presents the film with it's final threat. The concept didn't sit right with me and it felt to me as if screenwriter Joss Whedon was stretching for ideas.Perhaps the film would've been stronger if they had placed more of emphasis on the characters so their deaths would have an impact. Most of the characters are two-dimensional, with few exceptions. Sigourney Weaver returns for the fourth time as Ellen Ripley or, more accurately, Ripley clone #8. Weaver's spent three films building up a strong but empathetic protagonist and sacrifices it for an extra sequel where her clone is a cold, callous, hissing shell of her former self. Apparently, while Ripley's clone has managed to maintain all of her original memories, it's walked away with none of the best traits that made her who she was. I'll give her credit though, she still looks damn good in this movie.Most of the supporting cast don't fare well. Michael Wincott shows promise as Elgyn, captain of the BETTY, but isn't around long (similar to the filmmakers' treatment of Charles Dance in ALIEN 3); I also enjoyed Gary Dourdan as Christie, though he is also underused (I'm seeing a pattern here...). I'm a fan of Ron Perlman and his tough guy routine, which is all he does here as Johner. Winona Ryder is beautiful but feels incredibly out of place in this film as Call, the newest crew member of the BETTY with her own secrets and intentions. I still don't understand what was up with Dominique Pinon as Vriess; the rest of the ""good"" guys (Kim Flowers, Raymond Cruz, and Leland Orser) never really evolve past fresh meat that scream/yell a lot. The film's ""villain"", Doctor Wren, is dastardly cartoonish in his portrayal by J. E. Freeman, though it doesn't get much goofier than Dan Hedaya as General Martin Perez. The cornball factor doesn't lend well to a series renowned for it's suspense and horror, and I really felt it weakened the film as a whole.Probably the only aspect of the film that didn't underwhelm me was the visual effects. The shots of the AURIGA and the BETTY were fantastic and the xenomorphs are looking their best since ALIENS. Visual effects technology had improved greatly since 1992's ALIEN 3 so the CG aliens were much more impressive. There is plenty of gore this time around, giving the film a hard R rating, and should satisfy even the pickiest of gore-hounds. In that regard, the film entertains. I hate to sound as if I'm completely slamming the film because it's not terrible, it just doesn't live up to its predecessors. It's a bit more entertaining than ALIEN 3 but it's shallower in depth. The third film at least tried to have more substance whereas this movie accepts it's cookie-cutter format and runs with it, surviving on visual effects and gore.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not bad really,"Here is a movie that is more for die hard Alien fans than ordinary people looking for something to watch on the sci-fi channel at 1:30 AM. You'd think that after the ending of Alien 3, they would have stopped making movies. Then upon first hearing of a 4th, people were probably thinking negative thoughts already. However, as a surprise to everyone, this is not a bad movie. However, I did NOT say it was without its share of flaws and holes. Sigourney Weaver amazingly returns AGAIN as Ripley and manages to play her very well again, however she is very different in this movie than in the other 3 and I personally have to say sometimes her performance here is rather irritating. Ron Perlman plays the loud-mouthed Johner very well actually, considering the ""cool/laid back"" personality he appears to have. Wynona Rider is actually sort of annoying in this movie but I can't say she should be replaced. Gary Dourdan is also very good as Christie. Brad Dourif was excellent as Dr. Jonathan Gediman also. Die hard fans of the first 3 movies should like this one despite its number of flaws and holes. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
I was rooting for the aliens,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)Just ugly, kind of like a perverse Star Trek for horror fans. The dialogue is particularly bad, one of the worst scripts I've encountered lately. The actors curiously talked like they thought they were making a prison film or perhaps a low-budget Mexican western. Clint Eastwood extras would be embarrassed to say some of the lines.Winona Ryder is horribly miscast and looks and sounds stupid, although her voice is kind of amusing, especially if you like to hear her say ""f---."" Sig Weaver is semi-interesting in a bloodless and buff sort of way; but the rest of this dreary, low-brow space shoot 'em up with monsters, is a yawn. If you get off on gross biological freaks in formaldehyde, however, or like to pucker up to T Rex teeth dripping acid, or go for that special feel of flesh being ripped, etc., this might be for you.Absolutely worst line (but funny as twice-removed accidental humor) is Ron Perlman's comment (after Weaver burns and blows away the grotesque embryos and her own twisted, misshapen clone) ""Must be a chick thing.""Banal observation: you'd think after all the years in space, evolving away from mother earth, there would be some advance in degenerate habits; but no, these space terrorists still smoke cigarettes and drink whiskey-and I'M SURE basketball with metal nets will still be played on the playgrounds orbiting around Jupiter. Banal observation number 2: with all that fire power, you'd think they'd blow holes in the ship and lose all the air. Alas, no.There's a special place in hell for people who produce movies like this. In it they are fastened into seats with their eye lids propped open, forced to watch their creations for eternity. I think they should also be forced to talk about how good the movie is and how they've done something just wonderful.

Worst Movie Ever,"I just finished watching the special edition Aliens on DVD and I love that movie now even more than before.  James Cameron worked a brilliant sequel off of Ridley Scott's masterpiece.  Both of these Alien films were just that, FILMS.  The parallels and symbolism that they draw to feminism, childbirth, man vs nature, and even the Vietnam war are poignant and powerful.  Alien 3 wasn't as good as the first two, but it was still a good sequel directed by the amazing David Fincher.  I was really looking foward to Alien Ressurection when it came out, and never have I wanted 2 hours back so much in my life.  This couln't have been any worse.  From the cliched dialogue, to the gratuitous action scenes, Ressurection was 109 minutes of the worst piece of sci-fi period.There is nothing new or creative about this movie.  It covers the same allusions to the pain of birth, except this time we have to hear cheesy one liners to ""lighten the mood"".

It's wonderful to see 200 years later in Alien 4, all the military guys are hired to run away from computer animation. Not being racist here, but since a French guy directed the movie, I would assume he would put alot of ""artistic stuff"" in the movie, man I was wrong...

An Alien movie made by the Amelie's director?,"Believe it or not, it works and he did a wonderful job. You can even see some of his trademark french humor and quirky style and he does so without sacrificing the surprises and horrific moments.

Alien Resurrection was lots of fun to watch. I thought the creatures looked pretty darn good and we see more of them than in any other Alien movie (don't know about Aliens VS Predators though). The ""Ripley"" in this one was fascinating to me and Sigourney Weaver is to be commended for her performance. I also enjoyed most of the secondary characters who were quite well characterized.

The premise is so absurd, such a hollow excuse to simply grind out another blood and guts shootout with a monster that has become a clich√©. Once again we have the nasty monstery, the evil-doers who whip us into a frenzy of anger at corporations and government, space-vigilante smuggler types, the usual trotted out lot of superficial characters locked in a moral battle with big mean green aliens as a foil.

This silly but interesting odd-ball sequel to the Alien Series is quite entertaining.,"200 years later... Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has been brought back though the magic of DNA, because Ripley killed herself by destroying the Alien Queen inside of her. The Military Scientists (J.E. Freeman and Brad Dourif) decides to keep her alive and wanting the Alien for their weapons/science division. When a team of space pirates (Winona Ryder, Ron Pearman, Dominique Pinon, Gary Dourdan, Kim Flowers and Michael Wincott) arrived in a military space station. Which these space pirates has kidnapped people in their hyper-sleep, which little do they know, they are being killed for the Alien Species. When one of the group discover that Ripley is been brought back to life as a Clone. But this clone Ripley has an different side to her, which she's now half human/half alien. Once again, Ripley has to deal with the Aliens again but now she has to face also a complete different Alien is waiting to be born.Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Am√©lie, The City of the Lost Children, A Very Long Engagement) made a complete different sequel to the Alien Series. Jeunet's strange visual style and his sometimes humorous black comedy, certainly makes this one, the oddest of the four films. Which is somewhat uneven with the director's french sensibilities crossed with American mainstream film-making cinema. Weaver gives an complete, different and interesting performance as the clone Ripley. Which as Usual, she's very good in the film. One of the serious flaws in this sequel is the third act, especially the newborn Alien is a bit of a letdown. Although the newborn Alien does have some odd human facials.

Incredibly disappointing,"Now, this film might be better than the others I've deemed with ones, but it just had so much HISTORY behind it, y'know?  They tried ""resurrecting"" a series that had maybe not ended on a good note, but was one of my favorites growing up.  With this new version they add comedy (a la Gremlins 2), and a very weak plot to bring back Sigourney Weaver.

The Best Kind of Bad Movie,"Yeah so this movie is terrible and awful and a complete nightmare that I 100% recommend. I can't even go through this movie and say what they could have fixed because I think this is one of those movies that just needs to be bad for you to enjoy. This movie is absolutely insane.There are only two things to genuinely compliment in this movie... and it's a good thing these two things are good because I think if this movie didn't have these two things, I would have been crying instead of laughing. For one thing, the practical effects are actually pretty good in this movie. You can look up pictures from the movie and you won't find many things that are ugly. I would argue that the xenomorphs in this movie are way more convincing than the warrior aliens from Aliens (1986) and way better looking than the nightmare we got in Alien 3 (1992). The other thing I genuinely liked was the action because we genuinely do get some nice set pieces in this film.Everything else sucks... but in a good way. The literal first scene of this movie is everything, the first scene tells you everything you need to know about this movie. The first scene involves a bunch of scientists cloning the dead Ellen Ripley so that they can remove the alien chestburster from inside of her stomach and study it. Now... I don't know how many of you know about science but... that's not how cloning works. If I clone a pregnant woman, the clone isn't now pregnant. I would need to also clone the baby for that to happen. So what the first scene of this film officially establishes about the movie is that it has zero limits. There is nothing that this movie is afraid to do. Resurrect a dead beloved character and transform her into a robot? Aquatic aliens? Xenomorphs vomiting their own blood? Chestbursters that make their hosts walk around like zombies? Chest-burst-head-bite combo? Alien queen gives live birth to an alien-human hybrid? This movie has no rules and I love it so much.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Some good scenes and effects,"200 years after her death Ellen Ripley is cloned and an Alien queen is surgically removed from her body. The United Systems Military breed the Aliens which escape and an alien enhanced Ripley with group of mercenaries must stop them.I viewed the directors cut of Alien: Resurrection, it includes a few added bits - Lt. Ellen Ripley Clone #8 refers to Newt a few times, an alternate title sequence, a landing on earth and a few extra seconds here and there add to the mood making all the difference.The down side though - some of the acting is too hammy, the Alien effects are computerised in parts which is just as distracting as they were back in 1997. They should have stuck to practical effects until CGI effects were perfected as the physical special effects are outstanding.The New born is great and still gets my sympathy vote. The whole film isn't a gritty as the previous but the sets are fantastic. Some characters do get developed,there are some memorable moments which usually include Perlman or Weavers characters.The film including the extra bits bridge the earlier films making Resurrection a more enjoyable ride for Alien fans but to date, despite some good scenes it is debatably the weakest of the series.Watch and witness the resurrection.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Weird, but FUN!","A:R is an honest popcorn flick. You can't criticize this movie for being stupid, because it's supposed to be a fun movie. It's action packed, it's has an interesting plot, and most of all IT'S A BLOW S*** UP MOVIE! Nobody could hate on a popcorn flick, because Popcorn flicks are random, but it's basically a movie that's supposed to be fun. Although this movie doesn't equal to anything Alien or Aliens was, I feel this movie is quite enjoyable compared to Alien 3.I have a few problems with this movie, seeing as the gore was a little over the top compared to the other movies, and the fact there were some weird moments, and Ripley in this movie didn't feel as three dimensional as she originally was, and the character just feels like a wet blanket in this movie, and there are some plot holes, but besides that the movie is a ton of fun to watch, especially with other Alien fans.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Effective. Not nearly as terrible as Alien3.,"When David Fincher came along with Alien3 he nearly killed off the entire legacy when he failed to live up to the expectations and plunged Ripley into her death. Fortunately the wonders of Hollywood found a way around this to make yet another installment simply by cloning Ripley, hence Resurrection. It's all a bit too easy for me, but Resurrection does improve upon the last movie. The sets are fantastic, Weaver is still good, and the action is high-paced and exhillarating. Winona Ryder however doesn't belong in an Alien-film or any sci-fi movie for that matter. The story starts off in the right direction but it takes are wrong turn in the end (the newborn-sequence is terribly awkward). As you can see it kind of a mixed bag, although it's ultimately satisfying and it does make you forget about Fincher's screw up with Alien3.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not great but still has its place in the series,The first 2 Alien films have gone down in history as two of the best horror/thrillers ever so the final 2 sequels had a lot to live up to. Alien Resurrection was seen in a negative context from the start as it was seen as near ridiculous the main character should come back to life. This often turns out to be the film's main weakness. Ripley in Alien 4 is far from the hero we know and love. I should say now that to do the last 2 films justice you should buy the DVD set and watch the special edition cuts. The special cut features some scenes which really strengthen the plot and Ripley character (e.g. Ripley talks about her memories of Newt from the second film). Alien Resurrection is probably the weakest of the series although it has its moments where it beautifully displays the spirit and atmosphere that Alien is all about (e.gg the cloning lab) unfortunately the characterisation and dialogue are too weak to do these moments justice.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
This movie was made too early,"If Whedon wrote it and Jeunet directed it later in their careers, with not only more experience in their respective styles but also the professional credibility and weight to push for their exact vision, this could have been a great movie. Each Alien installment has chosen a completely different genre angle and this could have been a great gore/satire take on it. Unfortunately it is just trying to be a little bit of everything and doesn't succeed at any of it. Also what they tried to go for would have benefited from more modern visual effects, another argument for wishing this had been made at least 10 years later. As a standalone sci-fi flick it would have been decent for its time but it just doesn't hold up to the 3 previous ones in the franchise. RIP(ley), franchise!",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Brilliant Bad Movie,I don't knowhow to explainthis but this movie is bad yet brilliant at the same time.Althoughi would call it a bad movie I can't give it a bad review.I really enjoyed this film the first time I watched it and have watched it many times since.The cast it amazing and and really good to see Brad Dourif appear in an Alien film. He brings a real mix of horror and sci fi experience to the table. Despite the great cast the characters seem too animated compared to the previous films. All the Alien films are great but it could have been left at the foundery in Alien 3 which would have given us complete closure.Despite the cheese though this is a movie that is now part of the Alien saga and in a way works fine.

A dodgy attempt to go back to the well,"Good individual performances save an otherwise very ill advised addition to the franchise.Ropey connections to the main history and the occasional 'Whoa ... look what wee can do with SFX' moments add little to what is otherwise a damn fine set of movies.The first 'Alien'offerd a trip into the unknown. Aliens said ' we now have an idea what we are dealing with, but the scale of the problem is increased exponentially. #3 tried to return some of the first films aspects of horror an suspense and removed #2's firepower. But now we know exactly what we face and this time we don't really care.As a stand alone movie, It would probably score a little higher, not least because of the the performances by Weaver, Ryder and Perlman among others making the best possible of the writing provided., but the weight of such formidable predecessors as he first two drag like a millstone around the neck of this film",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Don't hate me, but it was as good as the OG movie","First of all, I have to admit I didn't had high expectations about the 4th movie and the rating of the movie was really bad, so I was sure it was going to be an awful movie. Eventually, it wasn't as bad as I had imagined and I enjoyed it, a lot. The movie synopsis was very interesting, but it wasn't innovative because it was kinda similar to the previous movies. The storyline was well-written and well-explained, even though it was simple and easy to understand. Gladly, there weren't as many characters as the previous movies used to have and they were all very interesting and funny. The casting choices were nice and their performances were descent. Regarding the killcount of the movie, the death scenes were bloody and there were some brutal kills. Also, it was a very intense movie and there were many action-filled moments (especially, the underwater and ladder sequence were probably the best ones). In my opinion, it wasn't as dark as the OG movie and this movie had a comedic tone. At least, the alien's appearance wasn't as crappy as the previous movie (Alien 3) and the CGI effects were very well edited. Moreover, the ending scene was definitely predictable, but it was adventurous and kinda sad. Last but not least, I have to admit I enjoyed that movie the same way I did with the original one. Overall, ""Alien Resurrection"" was an enjoyable sci-fi/horror film, action-filled, bloody and I would definitely recommend it to anyone!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Definitely lacks the brilliance of the first two films... but still entertaining.,"The fourth installment of the coveted Alien series more resembles Cameron's 'Aliens' in its basic structure to be primarily an action movie, lacking the suspense horror atmosphere of Ridley Scott's 'Alien'. The producers and screenwriters found a believable way to bring back Ellen Ripley once again to kick the alien butts. And they've got a good supporting cast of Ron Perlman, Winona Ryder (in a somewhat unusual role), Dan Hedaya and others.Although the film follows a storyline that somehow resembles 'Alien', which is good since Alien 3's complex story was a reason of its failure, 'Resurrection' remained a mediocre film mostly due to lack of twists in the plot and cheesy dialogues. The story is too much linear and the only plot twist involving the character Call was not directly related to the story. Yet the whole alien/human hybrid concept was entertaining enough and the bits of action were made well enough to watch. I feel the film did not aspire to be a cinematic classic like Alien or Aliens, but it did well enough to keep the saga alive after the disappointing Alien 3. It should be well enjoyed by the series fans.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Something went horribly wrong........,"Oh dear, oh dear, what have we here? It seems like it's not even part of the series. Alien was a land-mark in terror (still the scariest of the series), Aliens was quite good, a little over rated and talked about too much, Alien3 was amazing, fantastic atmosphere, great drama, floods of emotions, and then there's this.....this thing! Ripley's not a character you fear for anymore, like in the first film, cheer for as in the second film, or even grieve for like in the third film, she's just some character who has seem to have been put in so that people will go to see it because Weaver's in it. Too much gore?? Huh??? I think not! Too little gore. The first film is still sickening when Kane gave birth that it just beats all competition, Alien Resurrection's so over-the-top in its attepts to be slightly gorey that it makes no difference. If you want gore, see something like Hellraiser or the later Halloween films, or even Event Horizon, because this film even falls short in the gore factor. It's story is ludicrous, the newborn is pathetic, and its birth scene is even worse. Call (Winona Ryder) is just the mouldy icing on the rotting cake! The only redeeming factors about this film are Elgyn and Dr. Gediman. Other than that, this is a joke!",,Anonymous,Horror
The Vidiot Reviews...,"Alien ResurrectionThe hardest part of mixing human and alien DNA is picking the right mood music.Regrettably, the scientists in sci-fi thriller don't divulge which slow-jams were successful.When a ship of mercenaries (Winona Ryder, Ron Perlman, Dominique Pinon) docks at a military vessel to drop off stasis bodies for scientific experiments, they recognize a familiar face. Despite being dead for 200 years, military heroine Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) appears alive, well and enhanced with alien attributes, including acidic blood.The mercs eventually discover that there are other genetically engineered aliens aboard and that the infested ship is headed straight for Earth.Thanks to French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, this third sequel in the Alien franchise manages to stand on its own merits, despite sharing similarities with its predecessors.

"Ripley, Believe it or Not","The last time we saw Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) she was falling into a vat of molten metal killing herself and the alien inside of her. We are now 200 years later and she's back thanks to the wonders of cloning. Somehow, and this requires a lot of suspended disbelief, the military was able to scrape up enough of Ripley's DNA to clone her. Don't ask me how. They also found some alien xenomorph DNA which allowed them to do what they really wanted to do: clone a xenomorph.Ripley 3.0 is stronger, has keener senses, and a mind meld with the aliens. The rogue military crew aboard the ship she's on wants the alien inside her and they want to make more aliens as well. For that they'll need more hosts. There're always some space pirates willing to do something shady for a little cash. Hence, we got some space pirates who hijacked a ship with inhabitants in cryo-sleep, stole them and delivered them to the military vessel. Now these military morons can try again at what so many before them failed at: farm aliens for fill-in-the-blank.Of course, things went sideways.As a stand-alone movie, ""Alien Resurrection"" is cool. But as an addition to a storied franchise I didn't like it. I thought ""Alien 3"" was good and a boss way to conclude the franchise. It would've been a trilogy (a top ten trilogy IMO), Ripley was gone and so were the xenomorphs. Alas, greedier heads prevailed, and we got a part four. Why bring Ripley back? Or more appropriately, why bring her back in such an absurd fashion? You found her blood samples on Fiora 16, the space prison, where she died. How? Where? Did she just leave blood samples lying around? And why her? Why did you need her as the host? It didn't make sense to me.Take that aspect away and we have a better movie. Don't get me wrong, I like Ripley a lot; I just don't like the idea of shoe horning someone into a plot for the sake of familiarity.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Less bitchy this time round.,"200 years on from the events of Alien 3 ‚Äì and the death of Ellen Ripley¬Ö and she's back, cloned from DNA retrieved prior to her death aboard a massive spaceship.Why it had to be Ripley and not some random? Who knows aside from the obvious cinematic reasoning, but after a few tries #8 comes good and supplies the diabolical scientists with what they are seeking ‚Äì a Queen alien.After it is surgically extracted and the former host Ripley #8 is patched up she calmly tells the giddy scientists ""It's a Queen¬Ö she'll breed¬Ö you'll die."" Now if a clone 200+ years into the future knows what lies ahead (maybe she has seen the first 3 films?) we shouldn't be too surprised that she is right.The scientists eventually decide to keep Ripley #8 alive and she exhibits miraculous healing powers and almost superhuman tendencies ‚Äì the fact that they use basketball to highlight some of these new abilities lead to a scene best described as uncomfortably corny.Once the aliens put their heads together and come up with an embarrassingly easy escape the usual modus operandi begins, only this time more than a dozen aliens are criss-crossing the ship in search of tucker. In the early stages everyone able to escape does just that, for the rest it is every man, woman, android or cloned-alien/human hybrid for themselves.There is a cool underwater sequence that looks particularly cool (and as usual in film everyone can hold their breath for around 4 minutes). The Queen seems a lot bigger this time out but gets minimal time on screen and even less to do when she finally arrives and a finale that leaves me on the fence, it is either plausible or lazy ‚Äì I can't decide.Aside from dredging out the same basic formula of Ripley + stragglers once again the main problem is that Alien: Resurrection is spectacularly miscast. The ship's commander is Dan Hedaya and he's just wrong ‚Äì but believe it or not he isn't the least appropriate ‚Äì that would be Winona Ryder as Call, a member of a group of less than honourable space cowboys. The team are allegedly tough, rough and dangerous to know, and with Ron Perlman and the excellently gruff Michael Wincott among their number some of them are ‚Äì but Winona and a physically challenged and over-acting guy named Vriess it's more of an impractical eyebrow raising joke of a crew in reality. Some of Winona's dialogue sounds plain bizarre when she says it.Team that with a cartoonishly over the top Brad Dourif as a cuckoo scientist and you have a higher ratio of perplexing decisions than you have realistic characters, never a good thing.In reality this is a 6.5 ‚Äì a film with a couple of marginally entertaining moments but overall a patchy disappointment, but I owe Aliens so much that I can't bring myself to do that to Ripley, soFinal Rating ‚Äì 7 / 10.

Entertaining but mostly forgettable,"I just finished watching the entire Alien saga from the first to the last film, and this is the run-down: Alien: 10; Aliens: 10; Alien¬≥: 7; Alien Resurrection: 7.Alien is a horror movie that introduces the ingenious concept of the alien species and then ramps up the terror right until the final scene. I almost forgot how scared I could get from watching a film, but re-watching Alien reminded me how un-scary most recent 'horror' films are.Aliens also has horror, but focuses on action. It also ramps up this action steadily in such a brilliant way that every second of the film is thrilling. Watching Aliens again was just as thrilling as the first time. Films that can do that are rare, and certainly worth a score of 10.Alien¬≥ is a mess. It's way too obvious that there have been problems with the script and the directors, and the fact that they obviously got rid of most of the characters that survived from Aliens is jarring, but in the end Alien¬≥ is not awful. It has a unique atmosphere and some memorable scenes. One of the biggest problems is that it has almost no characters to care about except Ripley. The only other interesting character is abruptly killed half-way the film.Alien: Resurrection is also a mess but in a different way. Of course, the whole 'resurrection' concept is ridiculous but I could forgive the writers because there was no other way to continue the saga with Ripley included. What struck me the most is how little I remembered from A:R, even though my previous viewing was more recent than the other films. In fact, it has about three or maybe four memorable scenes and about two memorable characters. The rest is forgettable, albeit still entertaining.While Alien¬≥ still had some thrilling scenes, A:R relies mostly on gore in an attempt to be scary. Because all 'horror' films from the last decade followed this trend, I got used to seeing CGI monsters, horribly deformed mutants and people being ripped to shreds in all details. The original Alien is still scary because so little is shown and so much is implied. Seeing a dark corridor and knowing there's something horrible in there without actually seeing it, never gets old. Seeing a monster again and again, no matter how meticulously crafted it is to look hideous, does get old.Overall, the last two films are OK and good enough to keep the Alien fan in me entertained, but you won't hear me protest at all if a director steps up and makes a *real* sequel to Aliens without even acknowledging the existence of A¬≥ or A:R.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"If you want something new in your franchise, this is NOT the way to do it!","Well, yes! After all these bad reviews for this movie, we can do little more than place the blame and I think, the blame is with the producers, who wanted to bring something new to the franchise in terms of genre.This worked extremely well with the first two movies. After ""Alien"" was tense thriller, ""Aliens"" added a big-boom-action element, for which there couldn't have been anyone better than James Cameron. ""Alien 3"" tried to mix the elements of thriller and action a bit more than the second movie had done and, while being too cartoonish as a whole, succeeded in that and - to this reviewer - it was a step down but still OK.Then there's this! I don't even mind the guy who said ""Hey! Let's make the fourth movie a sick comedy with camp-scale 10 acting and sick jokes and let's have a man pulling a bit of his own brain out!"" No, I'll forgive this person, whoever he was. But who were the geniuses that said: ""Wow! What a great idea! Let's do that!""???They put a lot of money into this and got a few great set-pieces and a brilliantly made underwater scene. So, why did they go and waste it on this? There were some obviously super ideas, like Ripley returning as a part-alien and the lost crew of survivors trying to make their way out more or less adopting a man, who they know will soon die giving birth to one of the carnivorous extra terrestrials. But too many characters spend too much time, just trying to over-cool everybody else with brain-dead one-liners and their very special abilities (""Look at me! I've actually got two fire-arms integrated into my, er, other arms!"") or dying in an unusual way, which is obviously supposed to make us laugh.Let's all just hope, the executives at Fox learned something from this and if a part 5 comes along they a) do it with some dignity and darkness and b) let Ripley die for good. Not because I don't like her, but they have wasted a great chance to turn the character into something completely new and now it's going nowhere. If you need a part 6, let Ron Perlman take the lead, because he's the one slightly appealing character in this. (Sorry, Noni! I've seen you do better.) Or he's just used to working with Jeunet and therefore gives a more accustomed performance.

Alien resurrection sucks overall,"Jean Pierre Jeunet swans in here all French with a yellow and brown colour palette with a chance to make a great movie in a massive franchise...and balls it all up! Why? The main star of the show was ignored (the aliens) and instead crappy humour and visuals destroyed a good storyline. Another thing this franchise does not require Ripley to survive!The newborn was a good idea but looked really stupid. The idea that it thought Ripley was its mum was good and that when she killed you generally felt for the beast, but it looked crap, it had a pot belly for Christ's sake!. There were some good character development, and some characters to rival that of aliens, but other than that it wasn't that good. The story was the best thing. Another thing... Being a massive fan of the alien franchise mad me notice a few things about the creatures: 1. I suppose I don't mind them being brown in colour because if they were genetically bred from the alien on fury 161 and that alien was brown it figures really. 2. Why did the aliens roar?

dichotomies in life,"While ""Alien: Resurrection"" continues the story of extraterrestrial monsters going after humans, there's something of a dichotomy with Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver). Certainly she's in control and as much of a bad-ass as she was in the previous movies; hell, she beats the men at basketball. Which makes it all the more surprising when she utters ""How many men do I have to f--- to get out of here?"" If you're going to all the trouble to turn a woman into Rambo, why have her say that? Maybe it was partly that around the time when this movie came out, Sigourney Weaver also starred in ""The Ice Storm"" (and played an icy character), so it was a little perplexing as to why she chose to continue playing Ripley when each successive movie focused more on the gory aspect.Truth be told, I can't fully explain why Ripley does what she does, and I don't know whether or not the movie would qualify as sexist. I did find it pretty enjoyable. Weaver, Winona Ryder, Dominique Pinon, Ron Perlman, Leland Orser, Dan Hedaya and Brad Dourif play some neat roles.

Worst among the franchise!,"This is the Fourth Instalment in the Alien Franchise, Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet is a over the top, corny and messed up film that might deliver guilty pleasures to some but a whole load of headaches to the others!Film started in an interesting shape, slowly gravitating towards heavy Sci-Fi approach.
I was seriously craving for more. After a while; writing takes a huge tumble and it becomes a stalemate. As the plot progresses further, the blend of Action and Sci-Fi can easily be noticed. Had the writing and performance been better; this one surely had a spark that could have been utilised for the good. Sadly that wasn't to be.Terribly written dialogues and similarly worse performing actors made the script unbearable at times. Overly dramatized sequences ruined the eccentric vibe and Corny & Cheesy dialogue deliveries made it even worse. Apart from Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley; Others were forgettable and lacks depth. Characterization is one of the weakest link here; hence I couldn't care for any of them nor that I wanted to.If you have been following my reviews lately, you know how much I praised technicalities in previous productions but this time that too has some serious issues on its hand. Especially the Cinematography!
What about those awkard zoom in, zoom out pan shots whenever there's a hint of action or tension comes up on screen? How about the Bizarre editing? That transitions in a messy incoherent fashion all the time! And what's wrong with the soundtrack? Lame and disappointing for sure!Fortunately the CGI looked decent except few places where it seemed cheap. Overall the VFX department had done a better job considering the other departments' progress reports.Before I finish...Finally after the completion of Alien Franchise, I must provide some pointers.# If you love Pure Atmospheric Horror Go & Watch ""Alien (1979)"" by Ridley Scott.# If you're someone who prefers blockbusters more and enjoy typical big budget Hollywood movies then ""Aliens (1986)"" by James Cameron is the one for you!# If you have become enthusiastic about Alien Franchise then Finish the third movie as well i.e. ""Alien 3"". As it's definitely worth your time.# And don't even think about the last one, It was never needed to exist at the very first place. I'm here just because of Sigourney Weaver and her ever green portrayal of Ellen Ripley. Otherwise I would have skipped it as well!",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
I like the movie despite everything,"I'm a huge fan of the series. I think, personally, that it's the best sci-fi series that I have seen. Part of the reason why I love the Alien movies is that each one was created differently. The first focused on suspense, the second on action etc. So I appreciated each movie differently and I don't think one better than the other. I think Aliens is more fun to watch than Alien 3 but I don't think it's better. When I saw the fourth movie for the first time on the big screen I was blown away. I love the look of the movie and Ripley is just too cool for words. However, when I saw it for the second time, the flaws began to show. Reading previous comments, I agree that part of the appeal of the series was fearing for Ripley and the terror whether or not she's gonna get it and how she'll survive. I don't mind Ripley being powered-up but she didn't have anyone to fight that was on her level. The Aliens disappeared and they just didn't seem as dangerous as in the previous movies. The Newborn didn't look dangerous, just grotesque. The deaths seemed to occur because the movie apparently needed to kill off the characters. Characterization of the Betty's crew seemed inconsistent and I definitely wanted to know more about them. Consequently when they started dying-off I couldn't care less, unlike how I felt when Vasquez and Hudson bit the bullet. Lastly, the Auriga was supposed to be in unregulated space but it took them only three hours to get to Earth? And why was Earth so defenseless? A ship was heading straight for it but no intercept was sent. Other flaws are mentioned in previous comments. Despite all of this I really do like the movie. What can I say, I'm a fan. I love the Betty in particular and the whole ""look"" of the movie in general. I would love to see the series continue and see in what direction they'll take it next.",,Anonymous,Horror
The filmmakers have managed to come up with some original ideas among the familiarity of grungy spaceships and HR Giger's alien creatures,"I was ready to take a critical eye to Alien: Resurrection, especially at the sheer audacity of the filmmakers thinking they could get away with having Ripley come back after what had happened to her in Alien 3 (1992), however I was soon on board with the idea of cloning and ultimately enjoyed seeing Sigourney Weaver back in her iconic role once more, even though she's not quite the person you think she is.Writer Joss Weedon and French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet have managed to come up with some original ideas among the familiarity of grungy spaceships and HR Giger's alien creatures with some added humour, new alien designs and grotesque images which makes for a slightly more engaging film than the last one, albeit woefully thin on plot.Winona Ryder and Ron Perlman are welcome additions, along with a good ensemble cast, and with this one being in the digital age of CGI the filmmakers still opt for physical effects for the most part but there are some effective underwater aliens courtesy of the technology.The aliens continue to be fearsome, dangerous and unstoppable, and there's some good gross out effects, but how much longer can the studio think they can scare the audience with the threat of an alien appearing around the corner. Four films in and it does wear a bit thin but thankfully Jeunet's visual sense and Weedon's originality come to the rescue here and with tension from the original and action set pieces from the second it feels like a hybrid of all three movies that have gone before.Not a necessary sequel by any stretch of the imagination but an enjoyable one if you are a fan and want to see what a new writer and filmmaker can come up with.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The series weak link.,"It was billed as Alien crossed with Aliens when it was released in '97, but unlike Alien 3, time hasn't been kind to Alien resurrection. I would have rated this a 7 a couple of years ago, but i'd struggle to give it a 5 out of 10 at this point in time.It's visually stunning, much like the films that have gone before it, but unlike the films that have went before it, it's utterly uninteresting. The set-pieces are mildly boring, the Aliens look awful and despite it's difference (almost like a french black comedy), nothing goes right for Resurrection.If i wasn't an Alien fan and cared what is said about these movies, i would tell everyone to avoid it, but, it does have it's moments (Ripley destroying her clones was touching).5.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Insulting!,"I really cannot begin to express how much I hate this film. Even though it is not the worst film with aliens in it (that title belongs to AVP: Alien Vs. Predator) it sure is close. The first thing I'm going to do is make a pros and cons list so people will get a general idea of how I perceive this filmPros: The effects. Cons: Everything else.First the pros. This film has the best effects of all the series but that really isn't very surprising. The first two films were beautiful in their own ways and I thought the the third film was very atmospheric as well but they were all before the era of computer graphics and as Alien Resurrection is from 1997 (ergo after Jurassic Park which was the first film to really use the potential of computer graphics) it must be fairly straightforward to assume that the effects will be better. They are. The effects are stunning and even today (2005) they are believable. The director, Jean Pierre Jeunet, has a very distinct visual style and it works beautifully. From the space shots to the design of the aliens themselves. It all works. We finally get to see the aliens walk around and seem a 100 percent believable. We also get to see them swim which is nice little addition to their range of abilities. The gore in the film is very graphic and this too works fine but aside from the effects the film is pretty awful.The acting doesn't exactly suck but its not very good either. Sigourney Weaver does her best but her new abilities and the fact that she is not the same character as in the previous films does that we don't really feel with her in the same way any longer. Her performance is passable though and I have nothing against her. I don't know what Winona Ryder is doing in this film and her talent does seem to be completely wasted. Ryder's emotional range as an actress is very high but we don't really get to see it in this movie (for obvious reasons) and that is a darn shame. She is degraded to being eye-candy. Dominique Pinon, Jeunet's favorite actor doesn't really do that much in the film and quite frankly isn't all that good even though I am impressed with his English. Most French actors have a very thick accent but Pinon doesn't. Ron Perlman who has since become quite a big star has nothing to work with in this film and thus his performance is not really worth noting. The rest of the cast is a mixed bag. Some do decent jobs (for example Brad Dourif) and some do not.The story is what is really disappointing and (I feel) insultingly bad. The two first films had brilliant stories and even the third had a passable story (considering it never had an entirely finished script) but the story in the fourth one is just hauntingly bad. I won't go into the details as I might accidentally spoil the plot but needless to say it is really, really bad. Especially the ending is very anti-climactic. As for it being a horror film. Come on there isn't anything remotely scary about the film and the action is average at best.All in all a film that should be avoided almost at all costs. The only saving factor is the effects but effects don't make a movie.4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not as good as the first two Alien movies, but it is the easiest to watch.","I enjoyed this, the fourth movie of the Alien saga. As good as the first two, no, but at least it was a lot better than part three which I did not really care much for at all. This is also the fastest paced and more humorous of the four movies and that only adds to the appeal. You never get as tense as you did watching the first two, but that can be a good thing if you just want to watch the aliens killing and being killed rather than watching something that makes your heart race. Weaver is back as a clone of her former self, and quite frankly she seems to be having a lot more fun in this one than in the others. Ryder and Pearlman make great additions and really add the overall effect of this film. The aliens are once again reborn and they take over a ship as of you expect to happen. No one ever listens when they are told that the aliens can not be controlled. A group of mercenaries join forces with Weaver to fight their way to freedom off the alien infested ship. Good movie, though there is a few bizarre scenes here and there including one with Weaver and an alien. This one is not the best of the series, but it is a fun movie to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not really like the others,"OK, the movie is watchable. It's still a good movie but I think it really fails to deliver to the fans of the saga. I really like the 3rd movie. It's mostly psychological. Resurrection is another level of movie. I don't even consider it a horror movie. It's action, it's thriller (not much) but that's all. Sigourney Weaver delivers a good performance but the rest of the cast fails somehow. Winona Rider... well, let's just say I don't really like her :). In the end, if you are a hardcore fan and watch this as a hardcore fan, it will be a major letdown. If you watch this like an action movie, then you will like it.

This movie was directed by french filmmaker Jean-Pierre Jeunet which gave this movie a different style. The sets are fine. There are some good action scenes. The characters are somewhat simple (exept for Ripley). The alien themselves are CGI and look okay but not great. There are the most gory scenes in this movie than in any of the other ALIEN movies.

Mildly better than Alien 3. Emphasis on mildly.,"The reason I compare this infamously hated sequel to Alien 3 is because the vision is... clearer than Alien 3's confused and frustrating payoffs that weren't payoffs at all. Don't get me wrong, Resurrection is still fatally flawed just like any of the post-Aliens sequels, but at least this one didn't seem to cave in from impromptu rewrites from Fox executives trying to make another marquee franchise entry like Alien 3 did; Resurrection at least had some semblance of a coherent story even if it's still confused and totally unnecessary in terms of canon (at this point it's basically Halloween in space and Michael Myers is the Xenomorph).The Alien franchise has become something of a household name for a franchise that ballooned into something far bigger than a standalone film: and everything that comes after the original doesn't always necessarily work all of the time when you factor in ALL of the tie-in media since 1979 or 1986. So many movies can claim the same exact thing, like Planet of the Apes, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween, Die Hard, The Exorcist: the list goes on and on, American and British cinema alike. Alien didn't NEED to be a sequel-bait franchise after Aliens, but the powers that be Hollywood bigwigs don't let these giants sleep peacefully.Would I recommend this film? No. Do Alien fans look fondly upon it? Nope. Has it helped? In terms of what-not-to-dos in filmmaking, then yes. It's definitely not something to flaunt about the movie itself, but hey. It is what it is.Alien Resurrection gets 4/10 IMDbs. 2/5 stars. Better than Alien 3 in certain regards, but certainly not a classic or good.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Lives up to the Alien series,"I just finished viewing Resurrection Special Edition from the quadrilogy boxed set.  I have to say that I quite enjoyed this installment, maybe more so than ""Aliens"".  The plot is great; it tends to be a bit cheesy at points, but those just lighten up the movie.  There are a few unpredictable twists, and you discover more and more disturbing things as you watch.  Ripley's character is as good as ever.  A solid sequel in my opinion, way better than Alien3, which I found kind of boring and generic in plot.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Awesome, but has some severe set-backs.","This movie rocks.  I have 3 main criticisms though. The higher level of violence was different from the other films, but was not too disgusting(graphic and lingering).  The insinuated physical relationship between Ripley and the Queen though was vulgar and completely unnecessary. The second main criticism was that the film was shorter than the others in the series, and no time was spent on trying to get to know the characters (esp. the smugglers).  Surely 10 minutes could have been spent on making them better defined and known. Thirdly, the new-born. It was a huge disappointment.  Granted, the first time I saw the film, it was horrible and scary, but Aliens DON'T have eyes!! The concept of a new alien was good, but surely they could have found something more 'alien'.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
This is a movie I'm not sure they needed to make but isn't a complete waste of time either,"Alien Resurrection (1997) is in my DVD collection and is also available on Tubi. The storyline follows Ripley being reincarnated as a drone on a ship doing testing on Alien DNA. After the ship loses control of the aliens onboard the survivors will need to rely on Ripley if they hope to escape the ship alive. This movie is directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Amelie) and stars Sigourney Weaver (Ghostbusters), Winona Rider (Beetlejuice), Ron Pearlman (Hellboy), Brad Dourif (Dune), Raymond Cruz (Training Day) and Gary Dourdan (Thursday). The storyline for this is fairly terrible with a mix of some good sequences and some cheesy ones. Some of the science fiction elements are cool and there's some great kills and gore. However, the basketball scene is pretty cheesy and the overall premise is disappointing. The ending of this movie always felt terrible and the new alien concept was horrible. This is a movie I'm not sure they needed to make but isn't a complete waste of time either. I'd score this a 6/10 and recommend seeing it once.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Different than the first Alien movies,"If it is entertainment, spectacle and thrill you are after then you will be disappointed - at least when you compare it with Alien and Aliens.

Alien Resurrection,"At the end of the last film, we see ""Ripley"" (Sigourney Weaver) fall headline into a vat of what looks like molten lava, clutching her newborn - determined that neither shall survive. Well, luckily for all concerned, technology roars ahead and 200 years afterwards we have somehow managed to clone her - and her baby. Military plans for the killer beasties are the reason, but as we all know by now - nature finds a way, and after some dodgy DNA sequencing, they face an enemy that presents a terrifying hybrid of alien and human that could threaten Earth itself. It is up to her, whom the aliens still think is one of then, and a disparate bunch of space pirates to try to thwart the creatures - and to survive! This offers quite a shocking indictment of just how state-sponsored science, coupled with militaristic aspirations can lead to some hideous creations but aside from that rather obvious moral imperative, the rest of this is pretty routine. There is no shock left for us to feel; we have seen it all before and just like last time, the folks getting gobbled up are largely deserving of their fates.

A misjudged movie!,"I felt this movie was wholly underrated. Its whole premise was an entirely original idea, set apart from the other movies in the series. It developed Sigourney's character, the main man ""Ripley"", superbly! In was done in such a way as to make the whole concept of resurrection (which if we're honest is a bit barmy) quite plausible. And indeed successfully illustrated,much due to the talent of saucy Weaver, how a person,even one who has been around the block as many times as the lovable lieutenant, would deal with such a traumatic and downright baffling experience. The anger,confusion,frustrating,and so and so forth. Not only this but the introduction of several original and exciting ideas were sprinkled throughout the entire movie,the new born,the resurrection itself, etc etc. And still despite all this it managed to provide a hilarious, laugh so much 'till a little bit of wee comes out,script. Topped with just the right amount of action, plenty of guns, big slobbery aliens and the like. And all this set behind a visually stunning set, eerie, strange yet oh so alluring.

"It tried, and that's more than can be said for the next sequel...","The first time I heard of Alien: Resurrection was when a reader of those Hollywood magazines reported reading about a new Alien sequel rumoured to be in the works. According to his statement, Ripley would be ""brought back"" by cloning. Given that Sigourney Weaver insisted that she be killed off at the end of the previous film, those in the know were skeptical that she would even appear. In spite of all that, they found the right price for her, and the rest is history. Thankfully, she had the good sense to avoid the dreadful Alien VS. Predator project. Apparently, she read that script and said it sounded like a dreadful idea, which makes one wonder why Fox has never examined some of the ideas in such sources as Dark Horse comic books.Thankfully, Fox learned their lesson from the Alien 3 experience. Instead of rushing an incomplete script into production, they hired a decent writer and gave him time to come up with something watchable. As with Aliens after Alien, the decision was also made to attempt to follow up a slow, languid science-fiction/horror piece with a fast-paced, breathless science-fiction/action piece. The results, while not even remotely able to compete with the best of the series, are such an improvement upon Alien 3 that it makes the elements of Gibson's Alien 3 script that can be seen in Alien: Resurrection a bitchslap to Brandywine Productions.However, a number of problems keep Alien: Resurrection from really achieving its potential. One of them is the casting. While Brad Dourif can be believed in a film like this in spite of his relatively tiny size, Winona Ryder screams out ""miscast"" like Roseanne Barr would as the lead in a porn film. Not only is she tiny even in comparison to Dourif, her mannerisms and voice scream a softness that the world of the Alien series will not suffer. That she lives to see the end while more appropriate characters like those portrayed by Michael Wincott or Dominique Pinon bite it about forty minutes after they are introduced indicates that plausibility was a secondary concern to the director.The design of the Alien-Human hybrid in particular makes one wonder exactly what was going on in the minds of the production team. Apparently, a more crab-like version was originally proposed, but changed in order to make it seem more ""plausible"". That... thing... is meant to be plausible? I must have been asleep when they redefined that word. The statement that the Alien Queen also now has a Human reproductive system is a bit of a joke, given that it is implied in the same monologue that she reproduces asexually. Then again, given that the prologue expects us to believe they can obtain an Alien by cloning someone who carried one once, I doubt that respect for the audience's sense of the plausible was a big concern.To the credit of the film, Ron Perlman makes an excellent addition to the canon. Unlike Ryder, one has no trouble believing Perlman could survive well in a universe like this. Weaver has also grown in terms of acting to the point where the role of Ellen Ripley fits her like a glove. She could practically portray this role in her sleep, so there's not much chance of her not giving an awesome performance. With the new direction the character is taken in, she shows that there is nothing she cannot do if given a chance.In the end, however, the flaws outweigh the strengths. I don't know whether the seven minutes added to the Special Edition for a 2003 release fix this, but I doubt it. As a result, I'd rate Alien: Resurrection a six out of ten. It is far better than its most immediate predecessor, but long-time fans of the series had a right to expect more.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Inconsistent and Unrewardng, Alien 4 was a Bad Idea From the Start","Ripley returns, two hundred years after taking a Terminator-styled incinerator bath at the end of Alien¬≥, this time as a genetic clone. Where a rogue military organization sourced her blood samples, not to mention how they also managed to duplicate the queen xenomorph incubating in her torso, well, let's just try not to think about that. The screenplay certainly doesn't.Whatever the scientific explanation, it isn't foolproof. Both Ripley and the alien are imperfect replicas, each retaining bits and pieces of the other (temper, blood type, reproductive cycle) like a space-bound version of The Fly. Predictably, this experiment soon leads to disaster and we get back to the usual territory: Sigourney Weaver, sprinting through dim hallways and firing bulky weapons, en route to the last remaining escape vessel.Screenwriter Joss Whedon (I know, I was surprised too) apparently intended this as a tongue-in-cheek take on the sci-fi genre, territory which he'd soon explore in Firefly and Serenity, and was aghast to see everything played so straight in the final film. I don't think the Alien franchise is a great place to experiment with that kind of tonal shift, but yes, Resurrection shouldn't be a source of pride. It has strengths - the special effects, for example, are a marked improvement over the last film - but they're quickly overshadowed by the rudimentary plot, repulsive climax and hammy, made-for-TV acting. That last point is surprising, given the big names in the cast. We've got Ron Perlman and Winona Ryder, in addition to Weaver and a bunch of seasoned supporting players; they just can't work any magic with this brand of stiff dialogue and cruddy genre tropes. Not good.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Riveting,"While this movie is not entirely perfect, I felt the need to give it a 9 due to its overall rating of only 6.1.Too many people compare this Alien to the Aliens of past films. This is ridiculous, because every sequel has been almost categorically different from its predecessor. While the original movie was a groundbreaking landmark of horror-science fiction, the second movie, Aliens, was much more of an action flick than a horror movie. And the third movie, while attempting to be something of a return to the claustrophobic, narrow corridor brand suspense and horror of the first, was nonetheless a far different movie with a far different alien.This movie is a masterpiece. It exudes style, much in the same vein of The Matrix, but with a definite monster movie twist. This exuberance of style does threaten, at times, to overwhelm its viewers, but it is peppered with enough gut-wrenching violence that one's attention stays just under the threshold.This movie does demand, much more than its predecessors, that the viewer 'suspends disbelief.' The gore of this movie seems to be its only realism. Realism is sacrificed in the name of style, but to wonderful effect. Anyone who would expect any less must not be at all familiar with Jeunet, the movie's director (see ""City of Lost Children"").What this movie lacks in realism, it more than makes up for in style. Furthermore, while fans may have been disappointed by a lack of realism, I do not know how they could expect a character who was burnt to a crisp in the previous sequel to return within a realist paradigm. Even if it is science-fiction, one need only note that truly dead characters more often return to life in the likes of Friday the 13th and Halloween than 2001.And the ending sequence of the film is beyond harrowing.

An Honest Review,"I can't believe how the Alien franchise has been politicized in two directions by the same side of the political debate.I pointed out Ripley as an example of a strong female lead that everyone loves, and that got me the ire of the intersectional crowd. It's not politically correct to like Ripley when you have worse and more modern strong female leads.But, I really didn't like ""Alien: Resurrection"" and that earned me the wrath of the exact same people!!!!So, I guess the basic rule of thumb is that you are only supposed to like the bad movies to be politically correct?I don't know how it works.For those of you that are rational, ""Alien: Resurrection"" stinks.

Bringing her back the way they did, well, that's not only an insult to us fans that love her, but to Ripley as well.Seeing her like that left a sour taste in my mouth.And though I always loved and will likely always love both Winona Ryder and Ron Perlman, and though they did as good of a job as they could...they couldnt act their way around a horrible script and a terrible premise.You can't blame the actors for this nightmare. You can see that they are actually trying to salvage something from the mess. In the end, you have to blame it on the fact that this is an Alien movie that no one asked for, and it's a plot that should never have been.In 1997 this movie was trash. In 2018, however, it's fresh air considering the Alien movies we have now. But still, I'm giving it the 97 rating.it was over at 3, no need to insult a stellar franchise.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Somewhere along the way the ""Alien"" series went from originality to predictability...","If the third ""Alien"" film didn't convince you that the series has passed its expiration date, ""Alien: Resurrection"" surely will. While I must admit that this film is not altogether bad, and a big improvement over the third, it is in no way as good as its original two predecessors, and it is quite obvious from the establishing shots to the last.The first two films were excellent, but the third film was one major flop, due to horrible characters, unintelligably fast camera movement, and, for me, the idea of all hope in the second film fading. (Ripley risks her life many times to save Newt in ""Aliens,"" but then in a quick moment in the third, she (Newt) is dead? That's not right.)The thing that made the first two films superb was not only the tension and white-knuckle terror, but the cinematography (which won an Oscar for the original film), and the creatures, who were never quite shown to the extent anyone would like, including in the first film. And then the third film came along and showed the aliens' full bodies, and due to average CGI, the fear diminished. In this new installment, aliens hop along, walk upright, leap on people; heck, they even swim. But the visual effects on the creatures is so poor for a 1997 film that it makes one want to wipe the film from their memory. It ruins the original two ""Alien"" films. The aliens in this film look more like tiny lizards with heads shaped as melons than anything. ""Alien"" (1979) and ""Aliens"" (1986) showed the aliens from the waist up much of the time, and the creatures looked like men in alien suits. Which, in this case--believe it or not, is better. I like the hokey costumes; the creatures seem more terrifying when they hover above humans and move like humans. But alas, in ""Resurrection"" they move about like quick little...well...typical aliens, and the creatures are no longer original, but misused.The plot in ""Resurrection""--what little of it there is--opened my eyes to the meaning of ""contrived,"" ""simple"" and ""stereoytpical."" The plot is so incredibly weak that one cannot take their eyes off the screen. Here it is in simple terms, cutting out the BS in between: A ship with crewmembers lands at a bigger ship, where they are transporting cargo. Bigger Ship will be referred to as Medical Ship, where they are conducting evil, B-science-fiction experiments on--whaddaya know--the old xenamorphs, commonly referred to as ""aliens."" These aliens trace back to Ellen Ripley. 200 years ago Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) died (see ""Alien3""), and now they have cloned her to get the alien that was inside her. For some reason, they still have Clone Ripley on board, studying her. And surprise, surprise: She is part-alien because when they cloned her, the alien inside her mixed with her DNA (???).Somehow, Ripley still retains all her old memories. And when aliens escape from their containment chambers, Call (horribly mis-casted Winona Ryder) and the team of transporters take it upon themselves to ""get the f---k out of here.""Ripley is no longer an interesting character. In this film, she has been cloned and is quarter alien and what not. But she acts odd--the old Ripley is no more. In this film, she refers to the aliens as ""her children"" and in a truly disgusting--and confusing--scene, she finds a bunch of half-human/alien figures and cries. This scene doesn't compare to the ending, which is even more confusing and disgusting.The character-driven story is no more. The human quotient is diluted in an otherwise typical plot. ""Alien"" went from originality to predictability. Remember how good the first film was? Remember how excellent James Cameron's sequel was? Yeah, well, ""Alien: Resurrection"" had me wishing I could just see those movies again, and forget about how average this one was.2.5/5 stars -John Ulmer",,Anonymous,Horror
So close (and yet so far),"I doubt there are many people who are new to the Alien franchise, but, on the off chance you are, 'Alien: Resurrection' is the forth instalment, charting the life of Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and her seemingly endless struggle to rid the universe of the monstrous aliens.The first film, Alien, was heralded as a classic horror movie. Its sequel, Aliens, cranked up the action and is also regarded as one of the best sequels ever made. However, Alien 3 started a downward trend that fans were left wondering how this happened when there was so much rich source material to build on. Alien 3 was not up to the quality of its predecessors, but it had its moments and, if you look at it as a 'stand-alone' piece, it's better still.Therefore, Alien: Resurrection is the studio's attempt to make up for part 3. Do they? Well, sort of. For a start they realise that having only ONE alien and NO guns was a mistake in part 3. Now we have guns and about fourteen aliens. Unfortunately, this still means it's a step backwards from the planet full of aliens we saw in part 2.Ripley is back and, seeing as she's now part alien herself, is enjoying playing her 'duel role.' Plus the supporting cast are good. But, again, if you've seen Aliens, they you'll probably realise that they're all just there to make up for the characters (needlessly?) killed off in Aliens.At least the direction is good (as per all its predecessors) and the film looks brilliantly dark and foreboding.Alien: Resurrection is a good film, but, as keeping with part 3 rather than parts 1 and 2, it's better more as another 'stand-alone' film. An Alien film shouldn't just be 'good,' it should be absolutely amazing, setting the standards for adult sci-fi/horror to come. This one is a nice effort at the mistakes made in part 3, but it's still inferior to Aliens, sadly.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Decent, until...","*** SPOILERS AHEAD ***OK, so this film was your typical run of the mill Hollywood cash grab. However, being a fan of the Alien films I liked to some extent. Unlike other Alien movies, here you can see Aliens through the work of CGI magic, yes Alien 3 had computer graphics, but the ones here are much much better. So after so many years we finally get a good look at a regular Alien. Also the cloning story is kind of interesting especially since when this movie came out cloning was a hot news item, so you can't really say this film is a piece of trash that came from nowhere.Despite all this this movie has its faults. First is the surprising lack of Aliens. The characters only kill two! I was expecting some balls out gun battles with some crazy stunts and CGI effects, but none of that, though the action scene with the two Aliens is pretty cool. Second, the movie's biggest fault: The last 30 minutes. Basically summed up in a couple of words - Ripley has sex with an Alien queen. From earlier in the film we find out this is the alien she had inside her! Incest? With an Alien? Please, spare me the BS. And then there is the grotesque child monster which is an alien-human hybrid. I was ready to go with the fact that Ripley copulated with the Queen if the resulting Alien was a cool foe that could provide for an exciting climatic action scene. But that didn't happen and the climax is rather dull and the child alien looks quite stupid.Ergo - this film is only for fans of the series, others steer clear. As a fan of the Alien movies I rate this 6/10. It would have been higher if the last part of the movie wasn't so dumb and pointless.Rated R: graphic violence/gore, and profanity",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Basketball Scene...Enough Said...,"Alien 3 is a mess, but it's nothing compared to the abomination that is Alien: Resurrection. One wouldn't be wrong by saying that there isn't one good thing to say about this film. Sure, everything isn't horrible, but just about 95 percent of it is. Last time I checked, that's not a good percentage.Resurrection is a shell of the films that made this series great in the first place. To start, the film's tone is all over the place. It feels like the script wants the film to take a lighter direction but the direction does exactly the opposite. You have characters that don't feel like real human beings and always seem to overact to the conflict, why the conflict itself is overtly gory and grotesque, just for the sake of being gory and grotesque. I'm still not sure what audience this film was trying to appeal to. It's neither a scary thriller like the first film nor an exciting action film like Aliens. But that's not for lack of trying.Who thought it would be a good idea to have Ripley come back as an uncomfortably sexualized version of herself without any explanation as to why she was cloned in the first place? After the semi-heroic act at the end of Alien 3, there's absolutely no need to go back and recycle the same characters. And really, what was the point of bringing back Ripley if she wasn't even going to have the qualities we love about Weaver's portrayal. This does way more to hurt Ripley's legacy than it does to amplify it.Written by Joss Whedon and directed by the guy who made Amelie makes this film more puzzling than its predecessor. We know there were severe behind the scenes issues with Fincher's Alien 3, but who could have possibly greenlit Resurrection? There's nothing redeemable about this film. And I mean nothing. Great actors and actresses like Ron Perlman and Winona Ryder give less than stellar performances (and that's generous). Even Weaver, who has always been the light of this franchise was just passable as Ripley. Heck, the Xenomorphs themselves were pathetic. The special effects looked off, they were kept up in cages for most of the film, and the hybrid alien at the end? My god it was all-time awful.-Tone is all over the place-Script and direction take the film to separate places-Performances2.9/10",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Crew,"I've just read a fanzine review of this film which was quite swingeing. Someone else's comment was that the film was worthless.This annoyed me though I don't know why I haven't learned by now.One way to see the four films of the Alien series is that the Aliens are presented with different kinds of human opposition.In Alien we have a competent but unprepared crew of a merchant ship. In Aliens we have space marines who are built up as ultimate hard men equipped with state-of-the-art fire power. In the unloved but worthy Alien 3 we have the opposite of the space marines, unarmed convicts. Most of them turn out to be British character actors. It is fun to slowly sort them out, identify them and see them throw harsh language at the beastie. In Resurrection, the main opposition for the Aliens is not the soldiers, but a motley group of pirates. The soldiers run away, but the pirates die hard.The review that angered me said that this pirate crew did nothing. I think the contrary. If you know your film and your TV series, you will recognise all these guys, you will positively enjoy seeing them get as far as they get.I am not a complete enthusiast for the film as whole, though it deserves plenty of credit. But I think this is one of the best crews in film. Most films haven't a clue how to present any kind of team so that each makes his mark. This crew is up there with the guys in Deep Rising, the gang in Game of Death, the team in Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Amelie in space!,"I never was a big fan of Alien or Aliens...the good ones in this saga. I appreciate them as pieces of cinema that broke boundaries but I didn't love them. Even with this, I watched it because I had finish all of them...not particularly for anyone.This is a very Jean-Pierre Jeunet movie. You can see his hand pretty much in each scene, however much this film was studio driven. It's his particular visual style that brings it apart, the hand-held stuff, the close-ups, the dutch angles, even the sepia filter. I also appreciate the effects, a lot of models were used, a lot of tactile stuff and the CGI was not always bad.The bad is that story doesn't add much. I found it pretty generic but fun-ish.

Should never have been made,"'Alien' was a work of art, not so much a horror flick more a suspense thriller that is still enjoyable to watch again and again. 'Aliens' is a rare thing, a sequel that is as good as the first, very imaginative, well filmed and also enjoyable to watch again and again. 'Alien 3' didn't quite cut it, for a start off most of it was filmed in total darkness and when you can see what's happening there are to many camera angles to make sense of what you are seeing. Whoever decided that a fourth film was called for was out of his or her mind, 'Alien Resurrection' is just nonsense. So it's hundreds of years after Ripley was incinerated and a group of scientists have cloned her along with the DNA of the alien embryo she was carrying and spliced it with her DNA to cross breed her with the aliens. What???? And we now have hybrid aliens that can swim, a queen alien that has a womb and one is part human, insane but part human. The script is so weak it couldn't fight it's way out of a paper bag, a lot of the acting is very wooden, even the incredibly talented Sigourney Weaver fails to give a half decent performance, as for the continuuity, there doesn't appear to be any. 'Alien' was made on a minimal budget and will be a science fiction classic for years to come. 'Alien Resurrection' is a multi million dollar lemon that is better off forgotten.",,Anonymous,Horror
Is a clone still the original? Does it/her/him share a common humanity?,"In some ways, ""Resurrection"" is a logical fourth episode in the sequence: the trilogy has become a tetralogy. What SHOULD be considered (apart from the obvious need by the franchise to make more money) is that the Ripley character IS NOT THE SAME Ripley we saw in the first three.Ripley has been a constantly changing/evolving character. Within the 'original' trilogy, she has developed from the competent officer on a company ship, via a protective mother-figure, into a militant protector of humanity and, perhaps, beyond. Resurrection puts this much-loved, fiercely-protective character, into a situation where SHE is the controller. But who are we talking about? It/she is the end result of generations of experimentation: of an attempt to create a hybrid alien/human.Perhaps, the underlying message is that scientists cannot cage their creations, indeed, cannot control and/or understand them.The introduction of the 'mercenary crew' underlines this notion. Ripley has become an 'alien' complete with the 'attitude' the entity 'Ripley' has apparently always had.When, accompanied by the 'new' humans, she discovers her lab-bound predecessors, (complete with 'kill me' dialogue), the realisation that we are only shown a small percentage of the 'failures' is, perhaps, accompanied by the notion that she has every reason to kill ALL the research scientists.As a mother-figure to the aliens, who have, possibly, become more HUMAN, the hybrid clone (Ripley) still can't overcome her loathing of this invasive, destructive life-form.Whilst not the insect-based supermom, the Ripley hybrid surely offers us the luxury of feeling empathy for ALL mothers, regardless of species.There are subtexts within subtexts. Still, I could be overreacting. Damnit - it deserves better than some of the featured critiques.Watch Alien: Resurrection and make up your own mind. I did.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
When writer and director don't see eye to eye,"After the Alien saga was treated by a Brit and two Americans it was time for a Frenchie to step in and take the reins. Enter French auteur Jean-Pierre Jeunet, the man to helm the fourth Alien movie, Alien: Resurrection. This fourth installment takes place 200 years after Alien 3. Scientists have gathered blood samples from Fury 116, Lt. Ellen Ripley's final resting place, and used them to create a super strong alien/human hybrid clone of the Xenomorph slaying expert. These scientists pulled the Queen alien that was inside of Ripley out of her and used the Queen to start breeding the Xenomorphs. And, as one would expect, things quickly go wrong. It is, once again, up to Ripley to save a rag tag gang of space pirates from these horrific creatures running amok on a ship that is headed towards Earth at an alarming rate.Alien: Resurrection is undoubtedly a Jeunet film, with its darkly comic atmosphere and animated and eccentric style. He adds all of his usual European flare to this exciting and explosive film. Alien: Resurrection reverts back to James Cameron's way of doing things in this saga, making the film an action film rather than a suspense horror. Honestly, this is something I was happy about. It was neat to see the series switch back and forth between these two genres with Alien being a true sci-fi horror, Aliens being a strictly action packed film, and Alien 3 returning to the horror roots. Alien: Resurrection is non stop action and with Jeunet's visual brilliance it is an absolute visual spectacle.Where Alien: Resurrection fails, however, is in its script. Not so much because the script is bad, but writer Joss Whedon and director Jean-Pierre Jeunet had two different visions for the film. Whedon wrote a crazier and more tongue-in-cheek script, while Jeunet directed a more straight edge final product. This clashing is what makes this film falter the most. The style doesn't match the script, and when characters say or do things that seem a little silly in a more serious environment it feels awkward and cringe worthy at times.Also, Joss Whedon made a very bold move in what he did with the space pirates. He tried to create a group of characters who we could believe have worked together for a very long time and he tried to create an atmosphere around them that made them feel like a true space crew, not just actors thrown together to play certain archetypes. This is one of the most revolutionary things that the original Alien succeeded phenomenally at. No science fiction film has ever created this sort of atmosphere, and Alien: Resurrection does't even come close. Whedon tried to pay a great homage to the first film in doing this, but really he just revealed to us the things that made the crew of Alien work by showing us what absolutely doesn't work.Visuall, Alien: Resurrection is astounding and as pure entertainment it works pretty well. It's definitely fun and a great way to kill two hours. But with a script that is mismatched with the film's style and a story that is full of odd plot holes that continually take you out of the experience this film is kept from being much more than just a fun little action film. It has some great moments and if you've seen the other three films then definitely see this one, but don't expect the kind of quality you are used to with this franchise.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Surprising and brilliant,"I watched this film with three other people, all of whom, unlike me, had seen all the other films in this series.  Besides this one, I have only seen Alien, the first in the series.  While all of us agreed that Alien was a really good, definitely scary movie -- a real undie-stainer if you're not used to horror -- none of the people with whom I watched Alien Resurrection could remember much about the two other installments of the saga.  I think we will all remember this installment, though.I expected Alien Resurrection to scare me almost but not quite as much as Alien, or to completely bore me like the fourth-generation sequel it is. I was completely surprised.  Yes, it scared me when it was supposed to, and yes, it grossed me out when it was supposed to.  But this is like saying the hollandaise sauce on a dish of eggs Benedict is creamy; true to its arena, this is just what it's supposed to be.  What I did not expect Alien Resurrection to do, and what it truly succeeded at, was to move me and to make me think.  I also did not expect this fourth-generation sequel to be able to stand alone as a work of art which can be understood and appreciated completely separately from the previous generations.In terms of art, the costumes and sets are perfect.  The acting is incredible; there's a whole lot of subtext going on.  The writing is spare; unlike, say, Air Force One, a different breed of action thriller, there is no excess dialog giving rise to ridiculous overacting.  A substantial portion of this film's message -- which is mostly a series of questions -- is delivered by Sigourney Weaver's face.One of the people with whom I watched this film asserts that it is the finest science/speculative fiction movie ever made, the quintessential expression of the genre.  This is because of those questions, the message of the film and the issues addressed.  Speculative fiction at its best explores constants in human experience by removing them from temporal quotidian settings and placing them, at least in concrete terms, ""where no one has gone before.""All the great constants are here.  The very human issues addressed in this film include arrogance, bureaucracy, love, strength on all levels, the meaning of humanity, the meaning of tribe, motherhood, and finally, home and the implications of survivorhood.  Some classic questions include:  What exactly is humanity?  Human or not, what is the real definition of courage? Is there such a thing as ""natural"" selection, and how does free will enter into that equation?  What is a woman?  What are the duties of a mother, and how do we define that bond?  And, in a black-humor kind of way, when is it appropriate to apply tough love?This film is certainly not for everyone.  It's absolutely not for children. It's also not a good choice for either the squeamish or the jaded viewer, or for a viewer looking for an easy thrill or a formula horror flick.  It is a brilliant, ambitious work and one that might keep you up thinking past your bedtime.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
4LIEN. Classified,"The first installment in this franchise was a slow, hypnotically powerful horror movie with a twist. The second one relied way heavier on spectacular fighting and shooting. Neither was a disappointment, of course. But then a third one was made. It was no rival to the two before it, especially, upon release. And the production process was quite a story on its own. Later, things were either replaced in the movie or added to it. And ""Alien 3"" got significantly stronger. A similar fate would way later befall ""Prometheus"", by the way. Thankfully, the way the third film was received did not prevent a fourth one from creation.Probably the least pretentious of all the four to date, this is a highly satisfying monster movie. All it wants is a group of people trapped aboard a big spaceship with a breed of the legendary monsters on the loose. What's important here is how the movie handles the creatures themselves. No movie prior to this would give them so much screen time. No movie prior to this one would treat them with such reverence. Make no mistake, they are big, they are scary, they are strong and violent. Also, they are smart. You don't deal with them easily, no matter what training or experience you may have. The monster effects, visually, are easily superior to the previous film. And that roar they make was phenomenal.Ripley is back. There is a number tattooed on her skin. And there are experiments going on. The bad guys are, obviously, the creatures, but the movie does not regard them as the source of evil. In fact, they are living things. Highly dangerous, better kept as far as possible from us, sure. But that does not mean they cannot be hurt and suffer. And not every human being is a righteous person here, to put it mildly. Science going too far, that's what we're dealing with here. The finale of the film is easily the most disturbing yet.The cast, the performances, the plot in general, they were all good. And no character annoyed me in the film. Drama, peril, levity, they are all where they are ought to be. All well placed and paced. Some of the futuristic technology was quite inventive and a nice touch. However, this brings me to the only thing I would really label as problematic, the visual effects. The creature effects may be strong, but the outer space scenes could have been better. As for the characters, Ripley, Call, Johner, Christie and so on, they may not be rivals to the crew of the ""Sulaco"", you know, but memorable. And the soundtrack was very good, surprisingly powerful.Not as hypnotically beautiful as the first one, of course. And not as big as the second one, but not as pretentious and production unlucky as the third installment in the franchise, ""Alien 4: Resurrection"" features a solid cast in a simple yet very competent ""sci fi"" action horror with sights for the eyes to behold and threads for the brains to investigate.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Very underrated. Unique, expressionistic Sci Fi at its best.","To this day it still amazes me how under appreciated and misunderstood Alien Resurrection is. The four films in the series are a quartet of vastly different stories, due to the fact that the torch was passed to four very diverse directors over the course of the legacy. Ridley Scott crafted a tense, claustrophobic catalyst. James Cameron made a rootin, tootin Wild Bunch set in a galaxy far far away where no one can hear you scream. David Fincher gave us an odd, inaccessibly disturbing thriller where the real monsters lurked inside the humans, literally. French Maestro Jean-Pierre Jeunet, best known for his own charmingly surreal quartet of distinctly European wonders Amelie, A Very Long Engagement, City Of Lost Children and Delicatessen, made the final film in the franchise. I once saw a post on IMDb which prompted users to describe each of the Alien films in one word. The one response that stuck with me was: Alien-suspense, Aliens-action, Alien3- unpleasant and Alien Resurrection-weird. Is this accurate? Depends on your opinion of the series. Resurrection is my second favourite, after Aliens. To some it was weird, to many a failure, but to me it's a bona fide, rip roaring odyssey of gorgeous, gory design and offbeat ideas fleshed out by an absolutely legendary cast, headed up by Sigourney Weaver as Ripley. Two hundred years after she died, she is cloned using parts of the Xenomorph's DNA, and kept sequestered on a titanic pseudo military ship run by whackos who have never heard of a certain expression involving curiosity and a cat. She awakens, the alien genes giving her a decidedly heightened awareness which Weaver plays with giddy, sinister glee. This ain't the stalwart Ripley we are used to. Her eyes dance with an unearthly fire that pronounces 'here be dragons', in the spaces beyond science that humans foolishly venture into. The station is run by creepy, power hungry Dr. Mason Wren (underrated J.E. Freeman is almost ickier than the monsters themselves), and his sidekick Gediman, played by Brad Dourif in his final form, resembling a demented Pokemon who also raises more goosebumps than the aliens. The good doctor has commissioned a ragtag troupe of space pirates to bring him kidnapped humans in cryogenic sleep to be forcefully impregnated with alien fetuses. Lovely, right? This is where it gets interesting. Joss Whedon penned the script, and the crew of intergalactic badasses in this film are in fact the prototype for his endlessly successful TV series Firefly. Now, he claims that everything about the tone, delivery and execution of this film is wrong, and that the end result butchered his work. Here's my take: I've seen Firefly. It's good. But the team of space pirates in this movie are eternally more fascinating and worth spending time with. I feel that he really abandoned part of a great premise here, opting for a chipper, watered down version of a vision which presented itself to him and begged for further exploration. Firefly is fun, and it's characters are a veritable Partridge Family of interplanetary characters to chill with, but it lacks the steel edged nastiness and grit that he began with here. Michael Wincott is a blast as the captain, Frank Elgyn, in a role that's cut entirely too short but is aces while it lasts. Ron Perlman is a primate on earth and proves the same in space as Johner, the lovable lug of the crew. Gary Dourdan, the only black dude I know with blue eyes is Christie, with more than a few high powered tricks up his sleeves. Jeunet disciple Dominique Pinon plays wheelchair bound Riess, a tougher cookie than one might imagine. Lastly, Winona Ryder is Call, a doll with a pixie cut who takes an immediate shine to Ripley, leading them both to dark and dangerous places. Dan Hedaya makes lively work of Perez, the military honcho in charge, with Raymond Cruz, Kim Flowers and a shrieking Leland Orser rounding out the dream cast. As one might expect, all hell breaks loose in outer space as the creatures breed and hunt anything in their proximity. This provides loose cannon Jeunet with reason to fire off many a special effect that will give your gag reflex a workout and your pulse a solid pounding. There's seriously gnarly stuff here, especially near the end with a certain terrifying monster of an alien hybrid that acts as pure nightmare fuel while also being a bucket of fun at the same time. One of Whedon's complaints was that his lighthearted script was given the heavy treatment, which obviously clashed with the vision he had. Fair enough. It was his baby after all. But for me though, it works bettering he ever planned. The characters maintain a sense of gallows humour laced with very real danger, garnished with cheeky levity in the face of unimaginable horror. That's a good recipe to follow in any book I can think of. This one is ripe for redemption, certainly in the eyes of many who panned it upon release, and always ready for a revisit from myself.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best of the Alien films,"After the snooze fest and disappointment of Alien3, there was no where to go but up for the Alien franchise.Alien:Resurrection is a vastly underrated sci-fi thriller that seems to hit all the right marks.

The film is pretty gory too...maybe the goriest of the series.The series went back to the James Cameron style of Alien...lots of action, lots of guns, and lots of special effects. I found myself having a great experience watching the film and was constantly entertained.It's not as bad as some reviewers make it out to be. Yeah, Rider is a little dead pan but she's still pretty enough to look at. Resurrection is the easiest Alien film to enjoy, and in my opinion, the most entertaining.",,Anonymous,Horror
You can only repair things so much,"OK, this one does have quite a few questionable plot aspects, but it's still A LOT better than the garbage that Alien 3 was. First of all, cloning Ripley back into the series may come off as real desperate, but what can you do when the damage of Alien 3 is already done? I don't buy the idea that Resurrection stands out negatively as a pointless follow-up to the trilogy. If anything, it actually saves the series from ending in horrible fashion, both considering the plot and production.Resurrection starts off brilliantly - the cast is great (apart from the misplaced Winona Ryder) and the Aliens look better than they ever did; the 1st Alien was more magic for obvious reasons but there were technical limitations, whereas Cameron's Aliens were lost in the action-packed style of the film. Fincher's Alien was too obvious in its CGI-ness.However, the whole thing pretty much starts lacking when the action starts. It just doesn't really live up to the initial build-up (which I agree, may not have been that original as such). I will also agree on comments above that Ripley is not the same Ripley that we got to know from the first Alien movies, but again, she was already damaged by Fincher. Also, yes, the villain in this movie is a questionable one, for reasons that the viewer will see as the movie rolls on.I read some comments about how this one isn't scary enough compared to the other Alien films. This may be true more or less (I really think Cameron kinda started this by putting action before suspense), but on the plus side, Alien is once again a true sci-fi movie, whereas Fincher unfortunately steered it into the direction of horror.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
the worst one but still a fun ride.,This is the worst one of the series but that really is not saying much being that the previous movies are some of the best movies ever made. In this one its just a bit cheesy. The acting is not as well done and they add more computer animation which is poorly done.This movie is about Ellen Ripley 200 years after she killed herself in the prison. A ship found her and cloned her to extract the queen alien from her belly. They got it out and kept her alive but she breaks free as well do the aliens.This movie is not as good as the others. There is little to no story line but it is just really entertaining. The acting is kind of bad by some of the main cast but not too bad.,6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The end of what was once a proud series,"I really hope this is the end of this series.  Alien was a good film with lots of atmosphere.  Aliens was one of the best films ever made and it was one of the few films that I can say actually made me frightened and nervous. Alien 3 was stylistic but annoying and Alien 4 displays nothing that made the first two great.  In the first and especially the second, Ripley was a scared but tough heroine that knew better than anyone what the Bitch was capable of.  In the second film she says things like "" I hope you're right because just one of things managed to wipe out my entire crew. ""  Now she is a cyborg and she has no fear and that takes away one of the most rudimentary things that made the first two scary.  We could live vicariously through Ripley and her fear.  But in this one, it is just a bunch of idiots running around that we don't care about.  In Aliens we had Hudson ( is this going to be another bug hunt SIR? ) Hicks ( okay, we waste him, no offense ) Vasquez ( I just need to know one thing, where they are ) and even Apomb ( look into my eye! ).  These characters added an element to the film that Alien 4 could never hope to copy.  So what are we left with?  I'm not sure, but it is not a good product, that is for sure.  Even Winona Ryder can't do anything with the role that she was given.  So the series has worn out it's welcome.  It's time to put it to rest.  I have heard that there is talk of a fifth, are these going to go the way of the Rocky's?  I hope not because the first two were really superb films.  I really hope they end it now.  Please.  This is not a good film and I can't see how the next could be any better, unless Cameron directed..... nah, that would be too good to be true.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Too Weird, Too Gross","This one had a ton of potential compared to 3 but they took it in such a weird direction that it killed all the momentum it had from the handful of great scenes and twists. It was also filled with really bad cheesy lines, and it felt like the original 2 installments of the series didn't need lines like these. The CGI was much better than 3 and the aliens were way more realistic, so I have to give it credit where it does a good job. Ryder was a great supporting actress to Weaver. I just wish Weaver wasn't playing a clone so her acting could be on display like the first 3 installments. I would skip this one and just stick to the first 2 if you're looking to try the series. 2/5 stars.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Super fun!,"Super fun!I wasn't expecting 'Alien Resurrection' to come out better than 'Alien¬≥'. Sure, this 1997 flick isn't as great as 'Alien' and 'Aliens' but I honestly wouldn't put it that far off. I really enjoyed it, cracking action coupled with a great cast.Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley is a pleasure as always, meanwhile this is the most I enjoyed a support cast from the franchise. Winona Ryder, Ron Perlman, Brad Dourif, Raymond Cruz, Gary Dourdan and Michael Wincott all have positive moments.Not the franchise's best, yet arguably its most entertaining.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ripley's Believe it or Not,"One wouldn't think of pairing Jean-Pierre Jeunet, a half of the directing team responsible (in the 90's) for the very good Delicatessen and visual masterwork City of Lost Children, and Joss Whedon, a comedy writer fresh off an Oscar nomination for Toy Story (yes, there was a time) and just about to start Buffy the Vampire Slayer. But here they are, taking the franchise that started with Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) into another direction. It's one that's very promising, and in a very ""sci-fi""-like approach: 200 years in the future, the little remains left of Ripley after the end of Alien3 (you know, the one where she, uh, throws herself into the fire), is taken by evil corporation guys who clone her after several tries and extract from her the alien being still inside her to make, what do you think, MORE aliens to, you know, get them to do tricks and cure diseases and things like that. I smile just writing it.Of course, almost immediately, the aliens break out of their hermetically sealed cages (oddly enough through slaughtering one of their own for the benefit of its acid blood), and wreak havoc, once again, on a vessel carrying Ripley and a motley crew of bandits on a ship called ""Betty"", who were originally hired to get some extra clones to the military dumb-asses. After this, along with some of those juicy scenes of tough-but-funny dialog, Whedon kicks off a series of action set pieces that leads up to a revelation that is... not entirely satisfying. But it's got characters that, as unsavory (Ron Perlman) and strange (the clone-dude from City of Lost Children) as they are, we care about for the same reason we did in Alien and Aliens; they can take care of themselves pretty well, but only so far as in the midst of a dozen aliens - that have already hatched, of course.Sure, the tropes of the series are well worn by now, and perhaps Whedon and the producers knew this too. That is some of the fun of it, though its familiarity keeps it from being completely fresh (i.e. another ""a-hole"" robot on board, you might guess who based on star ranking, traitor on the ship) and there's a couple of things the characters do that seem a little stupid, or rather stupider than one would think to be done by either the director or writer (i.e. bringing along the guy infected by the alien egg), its the re-fresh part that makes it worthwhile. It's visually got the same kind of knock-em-off-your-feet flair that Jeunet made his name on at the time, particularly with an underwater sequence and just the way his camera can VROOM (not zoom) in on a character's face or a moment of action. And the storytelling, however old-hat in parts, tries for some clever things and even tries to lighten it up, ironically, with sarcastic touches and even campiness. Not to mention the actors all having a fun time, even if they don't show it a whole lot (Weaver especially rises up her flat Ripley into something cunning and sarcastic)At the same time, there's a few glaring things keeping it from real greatness. Aside from the conventions that in previous times Ridley Scott subverted as opposed to just taking along and charging up with adrenaline and ultra-violence, there's the factor of the ""human-alien"" hybrid. Its design isn't that bad, but what it does is never really made too clear. How much does its human side end up affecting the alien part? Is it cause its a baby, or has it grown super-fast? And before we can have some time with this creation that has some interest even in its silly dimensions (ever seen an alien 'lick' someone with its tongue, don't think so), it's given one of the most needlessly gory death scenes I've seen in recent memory. I find it hard to believe it was originally planned for the first Alien movie, but even as such its presentation here from Jeunet is just mind-bogglingly over the top, and not in a funny way. Up until this point I had been with the movie, more or less (mostly more), as a work of commercial Hollywood art. And then it had to go into pricey-goofy Troma-vision. 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
An Awful Film With Near Nothing Going For It,"Alien Resurrection is directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet and once again stars Sigourney Weaver, this time as a clone of Ellen Ripley. 200 years after the events of Alien 3 (1992), Ripley is resurrected, hence the title, so that scientists can extract the alien queen that was inside of her. However, this Ripley is a hybrid of Ripley and an alien queen, so she has a few extra perks, such as super strength and acid blood. When an alien breaks loose on the ship she's on, she must team up with space pirates to ultimately stop it from killing everyone on board.Simply put, this film was trash. I found nothing good about Alien: Resurrection; even Sigourney Weaver's acting was pretty bad.. Not a single thing in Alien: Resurrection was good, and I could barely force myself to keep watching it. The direction, the script, the characters, the acting, and even the special effects were bad. Everything about Alien: Resurrection was completely awful.The worst thing about Alien: Resurrection was the characters and the actors that portrayed them. Sigourney Weaver doesn't do bad, but she's far from good. All of the other actors are pretty bad, and were disappointing in every single way, especially that of Winona Ryder. Both her acting and character, Call, was horrible. Her character was annoying and got in the way of any productivity, and Ryder didn't even play the part well. All of her lines were delivered as if a 9 year old child was delivering them.The script and direction are both incredibly lazy. Not a single shot in the entire film stands out, and the lines written are either boring or bad. The few lines that aren't complete garbage are bland, and feel like a premature script writer with no experience had written them. The saddest thing is, Joss Whedon wrote the script. His abilities have obviously matured since that of Alien: Resurrection, but that doesn't excuse the bad writing. All of the direction was pretty boring and grim, and didn't provide the film with a decent atmosphere.The special effects, while not as bad as in Alien 3 (1992), still aren't that good. Most of the shots of an alien swimming, or climbing a ladder, or running on walls looked really fake and inexcusable. Most of the ""suspenseful"" moments with the protagonists running from the aliens were completely tensionless, mostly due to the audience not even caring about the characters. Even Ripley's character has no feel to her, because she's not even Ripley; she's a clone of the actual Ellen Ripley, who was killed 200 years prior to this film's setting. All dynamics were stripped from the characters by the poor script, and left the characters as nothing more than names and bad acting.The worst part of Alien: Resurrection is the main antagonist towards the end of the film. I don't want to go into details and end up spoiling it, but the alien that Ripley is forced to fight at the end of the film is just awful. Nothing about this villain was compelling, or even scary. Not only was the character in itself bad, it also looked terribly unpleasant. Although the aliens are regularly grotesque, this particular antagonist was just horrible in every single way.In conclusion, Alien: Resurrection never should've been made. Not only is the script lacking, the characters are appalling, and aren't portrayed well. Alien: Resurrection is a step down from all three of its prior films in every single way, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"I fell in love with an Alien. And its ""mother""...","This may sound like a blunt statement but hear me out: the four ""Alien"" movies are basically just slashers set in outer space! All you do is replace the dimwit teenagers with astronauts, the summer camp or high school setting with a desolate asteroid or an inescapable spacecraft, and the masked killer with a slimy Xenomorph! The difference, however, is that - since 1979 already - the ""Alien"" franchise benefices from superior production values that have resulted in marvelous set-pieces, excellent ensemble casts, and astounding cinematography. And, of course, the ultimate differentiator is that every single ""Alien"" installment has been blessed with a genius director at the leaderboard. Ridley Scott, James Cameron, David Fincher, and now Jean-Pierre Jeunet are uniquely visionary masters with their own typical styles and trademarks. Should you have any doubts about the producers' choice for Jeunet, I urge you to seek out ""Delicatessen"" and especially ""The City of Lost Children"". Those are two genuine masterpieces he helmed in the nineties, and after ""Alien Resurrection"" he enchanted the entire world with ""Le Fabuleux Destin d'Am√©lie Poulain"" and ""Un Long Dimanche de Fian√ßailles"".Once again and unmistakable, the director makes the biggest difference in the ""Alien"" sequel. The admirable screenplay by Joss Whedon connects perfectly to the previous movies in terms of characters, plot twists and action sequences, but J-P Jeunet is an incurable fantasist pure sang. He's clearly a lot less interested in the overwhelming action possibilities and the mandatorily mean-spirited massacres, but like none of the other directors before him, Jeunet lovably embraces all the uncanny genetic plot aspects and the nightmarish but stone-cold Sci-Fi/fantasy elements.The best and most memorable sequences in ""Alien Resurrection"" aren't the bloody annihilations of the callous scientists and the unhinged space pirates. Quite the contrary, although plentiful, those killings seem rushed and uninspired. Almost as if Jeunet wasn't the least bit interested in them. The powerful highlights of the film are cringeworthy body-horror moments (like the alien's eerie rebirth via the Ripley-clone), and the downright shocking Sci-Fi curiosities (like Ripley discovering the aborted clones or the birth of the next generation of Xenomorphs). Also, and personally I found this truly exceptional, Jean-Pierre Jeunet brings forward a completely new Ellen Ripley! Another 200 years into the future, she's an indifferent and cynical clone struggling with maternal instincts, and that makes her almost more menacing than the aliens. A character like hers practically doesn't need a strong supportive cast, but there nevertheless is one, including great names like Ron Perlman, Brad Dourif, and Michael Wincott. Winona Ryder is somewhat out of place in this franchise, though.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Almost Ruined By One Very Repugnant Scene,"An absolute Gorefest. Probably, an inevitable inclusion in the popular Franchise considering the Creature and where it had yet to go. Over the top and then some. Not a bad idea in the ongoing Saga of the ""Thing from Another World"".Fans are mixed on this with most leaning to the ""forget this one and call it a trilogy"" and many stick to that Mantra to this day.

Speaking of look, this is a slick, funk-punk, biker bash of slime and grime with a sheen of Violence that Fangoria types might appreciate.The beyond the pale goings-on that have a certain Pulpy charm is almost ruined by one Scene that is so gut-wrenching and ugly that, after viewing, the pit of your stomach may never be the same.

"Some good ideas, slightly better than not, but this movie has problems.","It's not a good look for a storied franchise when even the images in the background for the opening credits give the appearance of a wholly ordinary, common, unremarkable sci-fi flick.There are, genuinely, some great ideas in the writing. There's some definite intelligence and cleverness in some of the plot ideas, & some of the scene writing. 'Resurrection' can claim the single best death scene of the entire 'Alien' franchise, a few instances of humor land really well, and there are some solid thrills to be had in this sci-fi horror feature. The casting is fantastic, and though somewhat contorted to fit into the director's vision, each performance is pretty great in my book. The set design and decoration, creature designs, and special effects look terrific, as do costume design, hair and makeup, blood and gore, and all those little details of which a movie is made. Darius Khondji's cinematography is crisp and clear, acclaimed director Jean-Pierre Jeunet illustrates his mastery of the medium, and I quite like John Frizzell's score. There's a lot that 'Alien: Resurrection' has going for it.And yet as it presents, this is a movie that didn't know what it wanted to be. Jeunet accordingly approached the material as a dark comedy, while the cast and others seem to be of the mind that it's a straight horror flick. Dan Hedaya is a fine actor, but to watch his performance here, it's like he doesn't know what movie he's in. I gather that writer Joss Whedon has disowned this picture - but what does his word matter any more? In interviews he has blamed everyone else unjustly interpreting his screenplay, yet if that's true, then it's amazing how often many other industrial professionals seem to get wrong many other screenplays he has written (gee, a pattern emerges). Whedon supposedly wanted the third act to take place on Earth, and to watch 'Resurrection' one can see how that climax is being arranged, yet that also seems far beyond the scope of what the series represents generally, and what this single title could have done specifically. Moreover, despite all the feature's advantages and qualities, it suffers from an interminably dragging pace that significantly stifles most available thrills and humor.And that's not even the worst of it. Again, there are actually a lot of good ideas here; the notion of Ripley having been cloned is one of them. However, there are times scattered throughout the length that raise a skeptical eyebrow, and some of the laughs the film elicits aren't intentional, but a bewildered reaction to a questionable inclusion. Still, none of this compares to a moment late in the runtime, pivotal in the narrative, when we see one character return, another tumble, and a disturbing beastie to join. What other response can any person give at this point except ""WTF, Joss Whedon?"" Please understand - pacing aside, the movie we get is executed very well. Even in the single most peculiar instance the feature looks good, and the cast perform admirably. Brad Dourif gives us classic Brad Dourif, to our delight. But some of the beats herein are another matter entirely.'Alien: Resurrection' isn't bad. It's not the worst entry in the 'Alien' franchise. I'd love to say I like it more than I do - but every fond memory I will hold of having watched this will inevitably be paired with recollections of how the entertainment value is dampened. No matter how highly one regards 'Resurrection,' it's hard not to think in retrospect that the grand saga may have been bettered served had it ended in 1986 with James Cameron's contribution. But... oh well. You could do worse; you could do better. Be aware of what you're getting into if you're committed to watching this, but it's still reasonably enjoyable on its own merits.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as good as the first two but better than Alien 3,"To sum this up Alien: Resurrection is great example of combining action and some suspense and make it entertaining as best as possible. While it doesn't have the scariness of the first two or the best acting, It's not as melodramatic as Alien 3. The story revolves around 200 years later after Ellen Ripley's death on Fury 161 where scientists have genetically cloned her since she had an Alien queen founded by the Company. While after the Queen Alien has been removed from the cloned Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), she is been kept alive for stasis etc. Then a cargo shop which has a load of humans that are to be used for hosts. A curious female later to be known as the android Call (Winona Ryder) finds the cloned Ripley and sooner or later all of the people are in trouble because, now the Alien Experiments have minds of there own and now are attempting to create a colony of there own. This movie was a pretty good one to watch I enjoyed the movie even if there were flaws. The one major one was Call, Winona Ryder is a good actress but I felt her lines were dry and she could have done better, and some characters that I felt that should have stayed in the movie more like the character Elgyn, and Brad Dourif. Another flaw was the Alien human hybrid creature it was just too sick and depressing for that kind of thing. Now off to the good stuff Sigourney Weaver potrays the Ripley clone in a different way but It's not bad I especially liked the scene where she founds out about the other Clone experiments failed. Ron Perlman gives a great performance as the muscle bound Johner who likes to make a joke at just about anything. Dominque Pinon was an Interesting character as Vriess, Kim Flowers was ok but had no character development but I did like Brad Dourif's humor relief (Especially making those faces at the Aliens) and J.E. Freeman was ok. The writing by Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer series) is a decent job but could have used some elements that could have given a more familiar Alien look to it but wasn't bad for his first try. The directing was stylish by French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet who's proberly directed a few classy french films before this one. The Visual Effects were good if not bad few were sorta fake but not bad. Overall I think this was a close to excellent movie that was underated and should have gotten more profit at the Box Office and to me Alien Resurrection was a near return to the Alien saga.Regular Scale-4/5: 1-10 Scale-8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"It does feel a bit under cooked at times, but weird, gross, and fun enough for me to really enjoy.","Alien: Resurrection was the first Alien movie I ever saw (in hindsight, I was definitely WAY too young to watch this movie, but I turned out alright). It's...definitely not THE entry I'd choose in hind sight to watch this franchise, but as a kid, all I cared about were the action set pieces and truly disturbing visuals this movie throws at you.Seriously, content warning: this movie gets pretty nasty (you also have to read that as if you're Ron Perlman). It has an undeniable late 90s cynicism and punk rock vibe, honestly. You think the corporations in previous movies were cruel and callous? You think the body horror of the previous movies were grotesque? You ain't seen nothing yet. I absolutely love that about this movie.It also has some of THE BEST set pieces of the entire franchise. It's the first Alien movie where the computer generated and practical VFX finally allow us to see the aliens move around and while yes, to 2020 eyes it doesn't always look great, it's honestly passable for most of it. You can't deny, the INCREDIBLE practical monsters in this movie, courtesy of Stan Winston's studio. My God. These things, seemingly always wet and slimy, just look unbelievably good.I honestly also think we get one of the best ensemble casts in the entire franchise with this movie. Yes, Joss Whedon is guilty of cringe inducing dialog and some stuff - particularly with Ron Perlman's character - that does not age well. Yet, this lovable band of misfit pirates who just happen to be on the worst ship imaginable really do have great chemistry. Dominique Pinon, Gary Doudan, and of course, Perlman, are great here. Brad Douraf, despite being in the film way less than I remembered, is so good here. He's about as weird and off putting as he'd need to be.I'm mixed on their characterizations, but I really like Sigourney Weaver and Winona Ryder's performances here. Weaver's turn as this ""new Ripley"" is great, and she genuinely comes off as about as dangerous as your average Xenomoprh. Ryder breathes a lot of life and humanity into the movie, that for something that is otherwise so dark, was much needed.The movie also has a decidedly European feel, courtesy of director Jean Pierre Jeunet. It's the camera angles, the editing, the unconventional moments, that might not be for everyone, but I really liked. I have to commend this series for (up until this point) giving different directors a crack at it. No two Alien films feel exactly the same as a result.Unfortunately, this film does suffer in two big ways. First is the script. Yes, it's not the greatest dialog in the world and Joss Whedon's characteristic snark and style do get in the way some times. More than that though, I feel Resurrection introduces a lot of big ideas that are just never really explored fully. Like, they fully clone Ripley and don't spend much time explaining how this was possible or what they're actually trying to do with her.They have a subplot about androids that really doesn't go anywhere. There's an overriding sense that this movie remembers halfway through that it's an Alien film, so just focuses purely on the action. While that action is good overall, I couldn't help but feel a bit unsatisfied by it.It's also really weirdly paced; the movie is slow and takes it time until it doesn't, and a lot happens within the span of a few minutes that sort of feels like they wanted to get to the ""good stuff"", and it just didn't feel totally right to me. Whereas the original two Alien films had absolutely no problem world building, this one definitely fumbles the bag in that regard.Overall though, this is a really fun movie. It's enjoyable, it's memorable, it has some of the franchise's best moments. It's undeniably underrated.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"It has its moments, but ultimately forgettable.","I think the Alien franchise is perhaps one of the most confusing franchises. Each film is directed by a different director with different style and taste that it doesn't really connect them coherently. That being said, what is most disappointing to fans is that they want more of that military sci-fi of Aliens.That's where this film comes in. Anyone noticed it tried so hard to bridge all the previous films? It tries desperately to repair the damage done in the 3rd film by bringing Ridley back to life. It tries to capture the horror genre of the 1st Alien film by once again setting in on a ship in the middle of space. Then it tries to duplicate the military sci-fi element by having multiple aliens fighting on a military ship.Here's the problem. First, the aliens weren't really fighting marines, as most of them escaped the moment there was trouble. They were actually fighting a group of mercenaries which nobody in the audience cares for. 2ndly, the 1st film was on a ship to fit the horror genre and probably a limited budget, what people want to see in sequels is the original gone pro. They want to see larger atmosphere, out on a planet like in Aliens, not bringing them back to the restricted space of a ship.And the final problem? Similar to Predator 2 and Superman 2, the cringeworthy comedic element. This is already a sci-fi military horror action genre, why add yet another genre element in it especially when it doesn't belong? The comedic element in an action film turns it into a parodic feel. This film became a joke on itself.All that said, it has it's moments. Some cool scenes. Aliens swimming was cool. But overall it really add nothing new to the franchise. The last mutation scene with the hybrid is just disgusting and unnecessary to be honest. They say the 3rd film killed the series, but this film killed the franchise. This is why Ridley Scott had to take back the project and restart with Prometheus and followed by Covenant, both of which are far superior to Aliens 3 and Resurrection b/c they were at least consistent in style and content.In the Alien franchise, the movies should be categorized as Ridley Scott's Alien+Prometheus+Covenant, Cameron's standalone Aliens, and just forget Alien 3 and Resurrection.

Better than Alien 3,"Ranking the original Alien quadrilogy of movies: for mine, it's ""Aliens"", ""Alien"", ""Alien: Resurrection"" and ""Alien 3"".Alien: Resurrection is a pretty straightforward movie and a spectacular one.You pretty much know what you're going to get - aliens on the loose, face huggers, aliens bursting out of chests, lots of violent action and Sigourney Weaver's iconic Ellen Ripley kicking alien butt - and that's exactly what you get. Nothing complicated, just some spectacular action sequences that tick all the boxes. The underwater scene was especially cool.Weaver is great, playing a different sort of Ripley 200 years on from her alleged demise at the hands of the alien on the prison colony planet in ""Alien 3"".

Special Edition,"-Blu-Ray THX SpecialCut version (116 min)In presenting the 'Special Edition' crafted for the Blu-ray release, Jean-Pierre Jeunet clarifies, ""This isn't a Director's Cut, as I already presented my directorial vision in the theatrical version. This is an additional cut where I've incorporated elements that both the fans and I desired.""Today, I indulged in this very cut on Blu-ray.""Alien: Resurrection"" (1997) is a film that has been sorely misunderstood. The Alien franchise is, at its core, an American creation. Its previous installments were helmed by American directors, and the narratives were crafted and conveyed through the lens of American cinema. That is, until this film.Prior to ""Alien: Resurrection,"" Jean-Pierre Jeunet had already established a distinctive cinematic language with his post-apocalyptic pastiche ""Delicatessen"" (1991) and the visually arresting ""The City of Lost Children"" (1995). He had garnered awards, cultivated a dedicated following, and carved out a unique niche for himself in the world of cinema. I've always viewed ""Alien: Resurrection"" through this lens. In fact, it was my gateway into the Alien franchise, being the first film in the series I saw in theaters, back in 1997 in Istanbul.Following this film, the franchise reverted to its American sensibilities, making ""Alien: Resurrection"" an eccentric outlier in the series. I commend Jean-Pierre Jeunet for his audacity in taking such a bold creative risk.The film's visual style is a departure from the gritty realism of its predecessors, embracing a more stylized and fantastical aesthetic. The sets, costumes, and cinematography are infused with Jeunet's signature whimsy and dark humor, creating a visually arresting and often unsettling experience.The narrative, penned by Joss Whedon, is a blend of action, horror, and dark comedy, with a dash of social commentary thrown in for good measure. The film's exploration of themes such as cloning, genetic engineering, and the ethics of scientific advancement is both timely and thought-provoking.Sigourney Weaver's return as Ellen Ripley, now a clone infused with alien DNA, is a triumph. She imbues the character with a newfound sense of power and ambiguity, navigating the moral complexities of her existence with a fierce determination. The supporting cast, including Winona Ryder as the resourceful mechanic Call and Ron Perlman as the gruff mercenary Johner, add further depth and color to the ensemble.While ""Alien: Resurrection"" may not be to everyone's taste, it's a film that deserves recognition for its bold experimentation and willingness to defy expectations. It's a testament to the power of cinema to transcend genre boundaries and to challenge viewers with its unique vision.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Terrible,"This film is a spit in the face to the master-piece that is Alien and Aliens and is firmly on the same level, if not worse than, Alien 3. While Prometheus and even Alien covenant do have redeeming qualities( and I actually find those films enjoyable) this film is pure Garbage. The characters are unlikable, the action and script are cheesy and the plot is just ridiculous. Where Alien 3 should have let ellen Ripley's character rest this film should have let her die. Even alien 3 felt like it at least attempted to recapture the spirit of alien, while this film is just a mess through and through. Avoid watching.

Look at the directors portfolio...,"... should never have been given to direct a title in this franchise. But he did, and it's rather terrible. More like a fantastic kids film rather than a sci-fi suspense horror that it's supposed to be. Makes me effing angry.Alien 3 grew on me over the decades but as I watch marathons, I find it very difficult to even contemplate sitting through this.The opening comic scene was enough to off red flags.I don't blame the actors or the production studio as the sets are pretty decent as it goes, and the actors are just playing out their characters role to the best of their ability. The story, writing, and direction are to blame for its shortfall.I suppose on a positive note, there is one pretty graphic scene that will scar my memory until I die so I guess it made more impact than I like to admit.My final verdict though is that it's a poor show.",,Anonymous,Horror

The Perfect alien follow-up,"Jean Pierre Jeunet proves his enormous talent in film making. Alien Resurrection is the perfect follow up on the alien triology, and matches the other films to a great extent. Already in the beginning of the film (when the camera moves ""into"" USS Auriga, and we learn about crew etc..) I got the special feeling that only the alien films give me - Especially when one could hear the ""alien music"" which has been used in number 1 and 2.Sigourny Weaver manages her role as a clone 100%, and the selection of actors that follow her are perfect.What prevented me from giving the film 10 (I gave it a 9) was some lack of action, and the unrealism in some of the shooting (when the alien avoids the bullets, and when its head explodes)The film now holds a special place in my movie-collection.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Accurate Summary...,"What can I say? Alien: Resurrection was a vomit stew of everything that was wrong, bad, ugly and laughable from the original three films.Alien - The original genius! Undoubtedly one of the top 5 classic sci-fi films of all time. This film continues to awe-inspire, terrify and disturb people - and will for a long time to come. It contains some of the most recognizable scenes from sci-fi movies ever. (8.5/10)Aliens - This film picked up where Aliens left off - it doesn't try to re-create the genius of Alien, but revolutionizes the genre. This film IS the modern sci-fi genre. It went where no sequel had gone before (like T2), in being recognized by many as better than the original. (9/10)Alien3 - Not quite up to the high, high standards of the original two films, and it contains quite a few sizeable plot holes. Yet enjoyable enough if your into this kind of min stream nonsense. It follows in the legendary footsteps of Alien in having only a single alien villain. A mediocre romp if you don't take it to seriously. (4.5/10)Alien: Resurrection - Sheer - absolute - awful - vomit. Terrible acting, screenplay, direction, filming, special effects, characters - the list goes on. Complete and utter crud.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Something to love,"This is the kind of movie that is hard to come by: a well written and directed story with elements of horror and sci-fi, a brilliant cast and a European director. It is not for everyone. If you simply want a rehash of any of the previous three films, this is not for you.Resurrection is not a perfect film, there are some scenes - dialogue mainly - which can make one cringe, but overall I found it to be the almost perfect mix of horror, action and irony. With the storytelling talents of Dan O'Bannon and Joss Whedon, you get layer after layer of interesting plot, while Jeunet's directing shows what a movie can be if creativity is let loose.I've seen this film several times now and I am pretty sure I am going to like it every time. It has not aged well, but it wasn't supposed to: its visual design was crafted for this movie only. It is not a Prometheus prequel and it is hardly an Alien sequel. It stands alone and you probably either get to love it or to hate it.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Whedon's script is juvenile at best!,"It's more fun reading interviews, Wikipedia and other online articles about this film than it is actually watching it. I'm a big Jeunet fan and it's solidly clear to my eyes that you can't solely blame him for this massive stinker.Apparently, he doesn't do English well enough, so he had a translator to parlay his direction to the actors. That's a big problem from the start. Then you have Joss Whedon's script; which I found utterly stupid with awful dialog. There's something in Wikipedia where he's quoted at some fan convention saying that it's everyone's fault but his. He is kinda full of himself, I'd say. Yes, Jeunet's direction through a translator is tough and some of the acting is abysmal (Rider saves the day, but Weaver is awful and Perlman is a cliche here...even though he's great in everything else he does!), but at the end of the day the script is like bad comic book stuff for 12 year olds.Jeunet actually adds some visual stuff that elevates the film quite a bit. If you like Heavy Metal/Metal Hurlant magazines, you'll appreciate the style he brings to this film. The aliens, however, look totally different and barely reference Giger's originals (I don't even recall seeing his name in the credits?).I even saw the director's cut hoping it would do something the theatrical didn't. I'm not about to do a frame by frame comparison, but overall it didn't seem better. My guess is Jeunet was thrown in over his head and the film was never really going to be ""his"" anyway. It all ends up feeling like ""design by committee"" instead of by a visionary director of solid reknown. Such is Hollywood, I guess. Sigh.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Worst excuse for a movie ever.,"Long time fan of the Alien universe; that being said - Biggest piece of crap in the franchise and that includes both AVP films although Requiem is 2nd biggest piece of crap. Joss Whedon should have stuck to Buffy. Too bad his ridiculous demon of the week episode style found its way into an Alien film. Awful doesn't begin to cover it. Horrible B version of an Alien story with some awful over acting and bad special effects in the way of goopy green slime for Alien blood instead of watery acid as was introduced to us in 1979. Not scary or creepy at all. More like a bad comic book story with bad Alien effects imagery to match.

Bad Saturday Night Live Parody,"Bad SNL parody, or at least it seemed like it. Well, FOX gave a the Alien franchise another try and failed miserably this time.  What we have here is a below average sci-fi action film that tries mixing both elements from the first two alien films and ends as a result looking like a very amateur attempt.  Certain action scenes are coupled with bad acting and predictability that they look overdramatic and silly.  It isn't hard to realize that the blame is solely the fault of the Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, a company which destroyed the this film saga by releasing a watered down and below average alien film by hiring a lackluster film director who destroyed a promising first draft written by Joss Whedon and brought in a cast of unsuitable actors and actresses.  Why? What for? Just to make money.  Who cares about the moviegoing public, moviegoers, are just a bunch of dumbf***ing idiots who'll fork over millions of cash because it's a film about scary aliens. There is no justice, not even in hollywood.  I guess we can forget Alien 5 because it won't happen that's for sure! Dan O' Bannon and Ron Shussette's masterpiece saga has been defiled.

Could of been better,"Alien: Resurrection is a sci-fi horror sequel, that makes Sigourney Weaver 4th return to the franchise her last. This time Ripley is a clone after the death of the original version of her in Alien 3, but she is half human and alien after being genetically modified by scientists to create a perfect replica of this new idea. However, a sinister turn takes place and she gets to know what they're really doing...Being one of the more shorter films of the franchise, it comes to feature more rushed scenes and quite cringe dialogue at times, but it does make up some of this by introducing new imaginative lore and some great scenes involving the aliens. And speaking of the aliens, they're the most strongest part of this film as they don't require any dialogue and pretty much present themselves quite scary and more violent than the previous 3.But, where the film declines in quality is the lack of good characters and a lot less quotable bits that really seem to be lacking. Out of the new characters I liked Winona Ryder's android but she was very clich√© at times and pales in comparison to the original droids.Overall, nothing interesting here I'm afraid, while decent concepts and good scenes are sprinkled out, nothing really captures the magic as it once did.Grade: B+",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Underappreciated,"This movie may not be what hard core SF fans or critics wanted to see in the Alien series. But nevertheless it is a very good film.Jeunet -- and the producers in choosing him as a director -- found the funny elements in the Alien saga and made a mostly bizarre sci-fi comedy. Well, it is not the kind of comedy Chevy Chase may stand for. It is a distinctly European kind of humour in the mold of Monty Python.It would be a mistake to give anything away concerning scenes but be aware of some really, really good laughs that will stuck in your throat. Jeunets satire reminds one of the pictures of Hieronymus Bosch, either you like it or not. Oh, and be aware that Jeunet does not need as much ""shock"" scenes like previous directors but uses much more graphic violence and splatter effects.Another thing: With all its gross humour the film delivers some of the most endearing and emotional scenes ever in a sci-fi flic.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

What I like a lot is some shots, the practical effects and design of the aliens are great.

"When Aliens Met Amelie, A Case Study in How Hollywood Treats its Franchises","Everything has pretty much been said about this film, so I would like to take this in a slightly different direction.Forget the plot. It steals left and right from the other films: the traitor from Alien, the guns and action of Aliens, the color palette of Alien 3... Joss Whedon's screenplay tries to shoehorn in character prototypes from his aborted ""Firefly"", and Jeunet's bite is less fierce without Marc Caro. Forget the idea of cloning, we've seen this before, and while Sigourney Weaver takes the character to interesting places, the opportunity isn't explored as fully as one would wish.And therein lies the problem of this film. The Alien saga is unique because it has two central pillars: - strong main character - fascinating mythology left almost completely unexploredAll successful film series built around a recurring film character are either episodically built around a main conflict (Harry Potter) or inevitably are ""comedies"" because there's only so much a main character can take (Indiana Jones and James Bond, we're looking at you).The Alien saga could have gone back to the roots of the mythology Ridley Scott and Giger brushed up against in part 1. Instead it tried to emulate what James Cameron did in part 2. It worked in part 2 because Ripley was playing against type, an emotionally limited intellectual having to be a soldier and a mother, and face her worst fears. We were all the better for it.And then came parts 3 and 4, and while the budgets rose, the ideas dwindled. Attempts to breathe new life in got stiffed, and however bonkers - Vincent Ward's medieval take, watch the DVD special features to believe it - original concepts were better than what landed on the screen.Maybe, more than anything, this is a perfect case-study for how badly Hollywood can treat its star franchises: with total aversion for risk-taking. Nobody expected the first film, and it reinvented horror aesthetics. Few people knew what to expect from the second one, and James Cameron turned the tables on them. But as the franchise grew in fame, so did the stakes, and for all the talented people involved behind the camera - Giger, Fincher, Jeunet, Ward... - the series lost the power to awe and terrify us.And now, after all these years, we are headed back to the darkest recesses of Scott and Giger's minds, with Prometheus.We will see what that brings. Its colossal budget might bode ill, its refusal to claim too close a relation to the Alien universe is probably wise. Until then, we will have the sometimes fascinating wreckage that are Aliens 3 and 4 to marvel at.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Disturbingly Interesting,"Alien Resurrection bridges the gap brought about by Alien 3 which was too detached from the primal fears that the Alien series explores. The aliens of the Alien movies are more than routine scary monsters. Alien R. brings back our disgust of the alien's parasitic nature and our fear of bodily violation.I did not see this movie in a theater because I believed that the Alien franchise had run out of steam. I was wrong. This movie scared me. It left me with an upset stomach. So why do I watch?I come back to this series first because I am fascinated by good movies based on the ideas from a short story ""Who Goes There?"" by John W. Campbell Jr. which include The Thing, Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Alien. Alien R. has all of the horror of birth defects and bodily infection with a new twist of genetic engineering gone very wrong. As with the first two alien films, it is a ballet dealing with true horror.My second reason for sticking with the alien movies and liking this one is Sigourney Weaver. In her role of Ripley she is at least the equal of any action star period. Her more hopeless attitude about the aliens in Resurrection is absolutely natural considering what she has been through and this obvious fact; these things will not die! It is not due just to the aliens but to the stupidity of human beings who cannot leave well enough alone.The other aspects of these films; the deluded scientists, the power mad bureaucrats, the tough crew members, the gloomy sets are all secondary to me. Frankly, I believe all of these elements are above average in quality for a film of this type. Even the peek a boo attacks by the aliens are not what really holds my interest.It is the fear of what abomination can get inside and emerge from us that brings me to these films and Resurrection has this in spades.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Good, but could have been done without","Alien: Ressurrection was definitely a good movie, but lacked much of the strength and purity of the other three.  As in Aliens, the plot was perfect, there were no holes, no corny lines, no cheesy plot.  Alien: Ressurrection had its share of these.  Put it this way, three times in the movie, twice in almost a ten minute span did someone come out from behind a door, just happening to come upon the main group, and just so happening to be (every time) a crew member they thought had died earlier.  Only like 3 or 4 main people died so the aliens weren't that much of a threat.  And you didn't get to see the aliens much, they were just kinda there, as if they were almost minor. It touched all areas of a good movie but lacked in every one of them.  It may be possible to reclone Ripley, but ones genetic code wouldn't include the alien.  This makes for a weak (but pretty cool) main idea.  The baby alien was evil, but dumb.  It was gross and irritating.

And it is why we do not approve of some of the earlier criticisms. This film is not a whim of Jeunet, is a commission from a European film to Hollywood, and I've seen other films of Jeunet ( ""Delicatessen,"" ""The City of Lost Children,"" ""Amelie"") will understand that we are with a pure Jeunet different genres, and it brings its own vision. A big disappointment for me was seeing a Jeunet ""made in Hollywood."" Although there is not faced with a change in the Alien saga, which came from the previous filmed by David Fincher, which explores various other fields in the world of fiction and horror.A director must have its own seal, and Jeunet's it.

It's okay... but could have been a lot better. I have to admit that even Sigourney didn't perform as good as she did in the first 3 films, but then again, she is now in a completely different role.The story is not excellent, nor is it horrible. It's just your standard scenario. There are tons of films who have a story development like this.The effects on the Aliens have once again improved and the creators really like to show it off. Almost every scene where Aliens lurk, they show on the screen. Sometimes full body, other times just heads or claws. This, in my opinion, is bad. The fact that CGI exists doesn't mean you have to show it every 5 minutes or so. They really over-used it and it damages the quality of the movie.A few new twists and better effects.That's basically what Alien: Resurrection adds to the series.It's a shame that this movie ended the Alien saga.

While the first three movies had their own sense of style and cinematography I still felt somehow they did still belong to the same universe somehow. While in this one it had such a distinct style to it, it took me a while to get used to it and connect it to the Alien universe.

Not so bad second time around,"I watched this film again for the first time since it's release ten years ago and was pleasantly surprised . When this movie first came out I had great hopes for it because of the directer on board , great cast e.t.c and being a huge fan of the series .My unabiding memory of seeing this movie first time is round is of huge disappointment but after watching it again my opinion has somewhat softened . I think we have seen so many bad films in this jaunra in the last ten years this film has started to grow on me .The film itself is visually very good Juenet captures the dark intense atmosphere of the ship very well , very reminiscent of the first alien . You can see they have went down the action adventure root like aliens instead of the psychological thriller root of one and three which is not a bad thing but the character and menace of the alien creature itself somewhat get lost in this one .The acting is quit good Weaver is great as usual Pearlman a Revelation but Ryder does not have the presence or charm for us to care for her character . The effects are not bad and still stand up today and the film has got a good pace to it and does'nt lag .BUT! and here's the but as with the first time around the ending is quit a let down . It's quit over the top gory and for me ruins the film . In remaking a new creature they loose what made the series so good the alien itself and the new hybrid cannot even compare to Giger's creation and becomes just another horror movie monster with no lasting resonance . I would love to see Scot or Camerron come back and finish the series properly I think it deserve's that . All and all I think it's six star rating is appropriate",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

There's barely any story, just a bunch of people trying to get off of a space ship, most of which characters we WANT to die.  Just a dumb movie all around.

Alien intelligence,"If this had been a silent movie, it would have gotten a higher rating. Visually stunning, the story is severely flawed with many preposterous scenes. There are poorly scheduled jokes, inconsistent story lines, and the scientific creations have more emotions than the humans. If the story would have been kept simple, then the action could have carried the movie to a successful fruition. The writers didn't do their job - they complicated matters with weightless stupidity. The movie is well cast; the amazonian Weaver is in perfect contrast to the tiny petite Winona Ryder. Ron Pearlman fits in perfectly. Unfortunately however, the actors & set designers could not save the movie from the brainless screenwriters. Turn off the sound and you might actually enjoy the ride.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Definitely not as good as the previous films,"Resurrection has some cool ideas but ultimately feels a bit like a missed opportunity. After the dark vibe of Alien 3, this one takes a wildly different approach with its mix of sci-fi and dark humor, and it just doesn't hit the mark for me. Sigourney Weaver returns as Ripley, but this time she's got some odd quirks because of her cloning, which feels more like a gimmick than a clever plot twist. The visuals are slick, and there are some impressive set pieces, but a lot of the supporting characters fall flat. Some are quirky and memorable, while others feel like one-dimensional stereotypes. Plus, the story can get pretty convoluted, which doesn't help when you're trying to follow what's at stake.It's nice to see the series try something new, but it didn't resonate with me the way the earlier films did. For fans, it might be fun to watch just to see how the saga continues, but honestly, I'd give it a generous 5/10. It's entertaining enough, but far from the classic status of its predecessors!",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
A good surprise,"Somewhere in Space -3000+. Humans have by now mastered the art of engineering a being from a few cells. On a secret military space station, they apply this knowledge on Sigourney's cells rescued from the Prison planet's disaster (see Alien 3) and resurrect her to get hold of the Alien she carried in her womb. The operation is so successful that they keep the mother as well for study. They soon realize that the cells have been slightly mixed up, and while resurrected Sigourney has inherited some very Alien traits, the Alien queen she delivered also mutated. And once again, the humans will learn fast enough that they are no match to the Aliens. This unexpected sequel of the famous trilogy might be the best of all, with all the elements of the previous three, but a lot of new surprises, and ever more enticing glimpses on fantastic creatures.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Icky,"Man, they had some really cool elements in this movie. The art design and cinematography were great, and the idea of pitting a rag-tag crew of space-pirates against the Aliens has a comic-booky appeal. However, either this crazy French director or the revising screenwriters got WAY too obsessed with the bizarre and the disgusting. The botched-clone room was TOTALLY unnecessary and the ending was down-right awful. They also killed off one of my favorite unknown actors way too early.They had a good thing going, but they screwed it up along the way.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"By far the weakest of the series, it shouldn't have been made.","After everyone dissaproved of the 3rd installment of Alien, people were a little apprehensive about this one, and quite rightly so. This is by far the weakest of the four, and in my opinion, it shouldn't have even been green-lit to go into production!The structure of this movie (if you look at my Alien 3 review) is more or less trying to return to the winning formula of the 2nd film, but it fails. And it fails with flying colours!Loads of guns. Loads of Aliens. Loads of cast.Credit due to the writers to be able to fluke a fourth film!! You see, after Ripley killed herself in the 3rd film, the government brought her back using her DNA!! after about 9 attempts, they finally get it right and she is 'resurrected'. Of course, the only real thing the scientists care about is the Queen!! and they STILL think they can control the bloody Aliens??!!!! Let it go please!!!!So, eventually, and predictably, carnage ensues. People die. People I must add, who we don't care about, so what's the point? The only real person we care about is Ripley, and she's half human/half Alien now anyway, but she's still sexy!!! A close 2nd as to who we care about is Winona Ryder's Call.Sorry, but this is one of the worst sci-fi films I have seen, and the 'creature' thing at the end?? perlease - don't insult me!!!!God help us if there's a 5th. It all smells of 'cash-in' syndrome to me now. People's hearts aren't in it anymore, let's make a 5th for a quick buck!!! Yeah right - I WON'T be there!!!!3/10erm...Enjoy?!",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"She'll breed, you'll die¬Öany questions?","Two hundred years after her death Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is cloned for the Alien inside her by a rogue military faction. After the Alien is surgically removed the Ripley left is one of mixed species' strengths and seemingly divided species loyalty. When the Alien breeds and decimates the military space station, it is left to Ripley and a group of ""where the 'bleep' are the army guys?!"" mercenary smugglers stuck on the outpost to stop the Aliens from reaching Earth.The standard Alien and space special effects are in play here (with one special ""birth"" near the end). The music has a tendency to get in the way of scenes instead of enhancing them. There's a nice mixed group of engaging characters in the smugglers (the lovers: Michael Wincott, Kim Flowers, the horny foul mouthed tough guy: Ron Perlman, the brainy soft hearted wheelchair bound guy: Dominique Pinon, the calm leader: Gary Dourdan, the one with a secret: Winona Ryder) and the obsessed to the point of arrogant blindness doctors (Brad Dourif, J.E. Freeman). Over all, the idea of a hybrid Ripley/Alien is an interesting one and makes for a decent center to a good fun action film.Did the director love Ron Perlman or what?! Gave his rough mercenary smuggler character Johnner all the best lines in the movie (""If you don't want to play basketball I know some other indoor sports,"" ""I can get you off...maybe not the boat..."" ""Waste of 'bleep' ammo...must be a chick thing,"" ""I'm not the mechanic here Ironsides, I just mostly hurt people!"") and Ron Perlman makes the most of it, turning in the performance most likely to be the first thing remembered about the film.Favorite line: ""Earth? I'd rather stay here with the things man!""Worth a buy if you're into the Alien movies, worth a rent if you're into sci-fi/horror.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Decent movie, but just another wannabe sequel","Unlike the previous movie which had no explanation about how Ripley got impregnated or how that one facehugger survived the crash landing on the prison planet. This movie improves that with a good reason. Stupid humans clone in an attempt to tame the beast.Involving a fleet of human traffickers to ""supply"" their science experiment. As expected things go wrong, and it's a survival situation like in every Alien movie. What this movie gets right first is its very own believable origin story. Keeping Ripley in seems to be the only connection going on in here to the Alien franchise apart from the aliens themselves, who seem to be slightly ""changed"" here. Where this movie falls short is a bunch of rag tag characters doing their own thing, a couple trying to be funny and the buff guy pulling the toughguy act. Except Wynonna and the OG Ripley every other actor's performance is forgettable. The bad guys don't seem to be tough or cunning. The shadowy black tone from the original movie which had all the suspense, fear, terror and an atmosphere of dread is lacking here, instead we have some late 90's bronze/beige color setup going on. Overall a fairly decent but very forgettable movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alien to the preceding trilogy - yes!,"Has enough already been written about this catastrophic loser of a sequel? probably....I just get so angry thinking about it, I believe it deserves one more shellacking!Having Jeunet direct this sequel is akin to having Walt Disney direct Rocky 6 (or FIRST BLOOD 4: RAMBO GOES AFGHAN, if Stallone has his way!) It has been made with absolutely no ""feel"" for the series. Similar comments might justifiably have been levelled at ALIEN 3 which initially turned me off too, but age and multiple viewings have improved it. The flick has much to commend it (refer separate review if you are so inclined!) ALIEN RESURRECTION on the other hand gets worse with each viewing and ends up being turned off earlier whenever I see it! But for the cloned Ripley (A mere excuse for a sequel...better to have had her wake up back on board the NOSTROMO having dreamed 2 and 3!) the thing is a childish and puerile copy of the original even down to the need for another ""Oh My God, it's a robot"" scene and Jeunet could be no Ridley Scott even with multiple clonings and genetic alteration!Ripley looks 53 and desperate for a decent scriptwriter. Winona Ryder is the wimpiest 'heroine' (I use the term lightly) you ever laid eyes on and the FX just plain laughable. The 'underwater sequence' with the digitised swimming-aliens is at once a cack-fest and an insult to the marvellous contributions of Scott and Cameron! The ONE decent scene in the movie is that where the two aliens chomp up their compatriot, so that the acid eats through their cage and frees them - I liked that! A thinking man's alien! I didn't find the ""kill me"" sequence either moving or relevant...sorry guys, just plain idiotic, like the rest of the disaster that is ALIEN RESURRECTION.What would a critique of this film be without its very own paragraph reserved for the ""baby alien?"" My only question is..""How did Ripley keep a straight face all that time, in the proximity of that nauseatingly comical piece of aberrated latex? For that matter, how did the crew not crack-up filming it?  Was it supposed to generate fear? pathos? serious contemplation of our scientific future?  What it achieved in my case (after the laughter subsided) was extreme anger, that some half-baked Director, who should never have been anywhere near the set of an Alien movie, would try to foist this insultingly bad and near juvenile excuse for a monster on to my patch! Enough said!Great ending too huh? It just stops! You could virtually see Weaver whispering to Ryder out of the corner of her mouth  ""Hey Win, that damned camera off us yet?""I would happily take up a petition to have every copy of this film destroyed world-wide.

Depends on you,"If you are an Alien fan and view the same as a horror concept, there is simply no way you are going to like this movie. While there's tons of gore and the non-Computer gen Aliens look realistic enough to raise an eyebrow, the acting, screenplay, cinematography and writing does not accommodate them as a horror or suspense theme. If you aren't really a fan and just want some entertainment, then this movie can be recommended. Its strange that they went for a weirdass and improbable story like this when they had tons of ideas for Alien 3 which they never even implemented? The movie can possibly be much more entertaining than Alien 3 which tries to be a horror but fails a lot at it because they ended up implementing the worst ideas. Even so, Alien 3 has slightly higher production values and suspense. But Alien 4 is just plain old fun to view. Both Alien 3 and Alien 4 cannot be put in the league of the first two parts. My guess is that the next Alien movie if ever made, would be a remake of sorts, going to back to the derelict ship, being explored by a humanoid race other than humans.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Weaver as Riply Saves the Movie,"18 April 2017. Sigourney Weaver saves this movie. It is valuable to note the she was given a co-producer credit for this movie and her sublime individual performance in it testifies to her influence in transforming this movie from a poor parody of Alien into a singularly powerful character driven movie. Yes the rest of the movie is pretty much a mishmash of typical science fiction outer space horror fare. Yes the script and dialogue is pretty lame by comparison, especially the General Perez who comes across as a crazed, weirdo military leader.Nevertheless, the plot outline is decent and the one-liner humor is amazingly spread well throughout the movie and deliciously pungent with irony in reference to the original 1979 classic. There are a number of parallel scenes, particularly towards the end with a shot resembling Ripley and her cat and later in Aliens (1986) and Newt. Ripley's character is likely to have been overlooked by many. The complex hybrid synthesis is quite amazing with Weaver's performance. Her sensual mother-child emotive and psychic relationship is something to really experience. Weaver manages to lay the ironic humor, dialogue, and a otherworldly, almost alien shimmer to her performance, one that is simply worth experiencing for watching this movie for itself.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Unnecessary fourth installment of an all-time great saga,"After Alien3, it seemed the Alien Saga had drawn to a (fairly acceptable)close.  But thanks to a rather ingenious premise, Ripley is back, but for all the anticipation, the film fails to live up to its predecessors.Director Jeunet's surrealistic style worked quite well in Delicatessen, but on this occasion it only serves to betray the spirit of the series.  There are some genuinely eerie moments, but most of the jokes fall flat, and the plot is predictable enough to extinguish any notion of suspense.  And the fact that Ripley is not really 'Ripley' means the audience has no one to root for apart from a cliched bunch of mercenaries about whom one could not care less.It would all be forgivable, however, had it not been for the diabolical casting of Winona Ryder as the Bishop-esque cyborg Call: she may be a good actress, but looks completely at a loss here.Alien: Resurrection is still a must-see, but only because it is part of something far grander than itself.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Hollywood franchise gutted by an echo of the French New Wave.,"I've been waiting for years for someone more articulate than myself to tackle this, but I still haven't read the review of this film that I've been waiting to see. I guess I'll have to write it myself.I believe there's ample evidence on the screen in Alien: Resurrection to suggest that Jeunet had ulterior motives when he put this film together. While Scott, Cameron and Fincher all had the intention of making seamless Hollywood films that pull the audience into their world of horror and sci-fi for a cathartic and engaging experience, I do not believe that was the intention of this film. I believe Jeunet was using a method well-known to fans of the French New Wave that is often referred to as ""laying bare the device."" The intention was to make the moviegoers aware that they were watching a movie by allowing continuity errors or allowing the cameraman to catch his own reflection in a mirror. It was supposed to pull you out of the moment and make you aware that you were watching actors performing. What Jeunet does in this film is actually more subtle. He sets up scenes that parody conventions of Hollywood blockbusters and he pushes them just far enough so we know as an audience that we're in on the joke before continuing on. For a moment we're taken out of the film and given time to reflect on how ridiculous the genre can be, but before casual moviegoers can throw up their hands the film begins to take itself seriously again and we proceed. It's like Jeunet was taking potshots at Hollywood on their dime.There are dozens of examples of this technique in the film. An example is when Dan Hedaya's General Perez is attacked from behind and he reaches around and grabs a piece of his brain to examine. Another is when Michael Wincott's Elgyn is led down a corridor by a trail of guns which he picks up one by one as he walks into a trap. Or the whole gag about the door locks keying on the breath of the people with access. Or when Ron Perlman delivers his ""Waste of ammo...must be a chick thing"" line (which holds the convention of the action- hero one-liner up to the light). You can go on and on with these examples. Some have suggested it was just bad writing, but I feel like there are too many clear signs that this was Jeunet's attempt to murder a Hollywood franchise by milking its own conceits until it drowned in them.The next Alien film will undoubtedly be ""back on track"" as far as the intent of the filmmaker goes. Paul Anderson isn't exactly known for the layers of subtext in his films. I think it's very interesting that Alien: Resurrection was made at all. I also wonder if Fox ever had any idea (or has any idea to this day) that Jeunet made this film to ridicule and destroy the Alien franchise.",,Anonymous,Horror

Better than 3!,"After seeing and being disgusted with the 3rd installment I wasn't about to spend money to see this latest slaughtering of a classic. So instead I watched it on HBO. The story line had several well placed plots that kept the story moving at a surprisingly steady pace. Of course like everyone else I was not happy with the ending and the whole""baby alien"" thing was a joke. The creature design was poor and unsophisticated for the series. That being the only major flaw of the movie this piece got more respect from me than the third piece did. After several years I find myself watching all four installments all over again and yes, Aliens3 has gotten better with age. As will resurrection. It leaves the series open for another installment, even though it should have ended with 3. The 5th piece would more than likely be an alien invasion of earth, but first Wynonna needs to get out of jail before filming could start and her trailer would have to be routinely checked to make sure none of the props or costumes were taken.

Pretty much any sci-fi movie that you compare to the first two movies will look bad and understandably if you are hoping it will be as good as the first two you will be let down. As a stand alone move it obviously doesn't warrant a 10 but people give it such a bad rep that i think it scares a lot of people from even giving it a chance, its really not that bad.

The Franchise Runs Out Of Steam,"Alien Resurrection is the 4th film in the series and brings Sigourney Weaver's character back from the dead. In the supporting cast we have Winona Ryder, Ron Perlman, Gary Dourdan and Michael Wincott. Firstly on the cast, Wincott is totally wasted in the role he is given very much like Charles Dance in Alien 3. Definitely a missed opportunity with the fate of his character. Perlman and Dourdan do ok with what they are given as does Winona Ryder. Weaver plays Ripley differently this time and she has to due to the storyline. She is good here but no longer an empathetic character. Tonally the film is all over the place. Comedic elements coupled with dark scenes such as Ripley finding all the failed experiments clash completely with each other. Characters feel like caricatures and the Aliens are no longer scary. It feels like the film is going for an Aliens vibe but misses the mark completely. Where things really fall apart are in the final act. The new-born alien is horrendous and looks ridiculous. I also felt the ending was abrupt and nothing felt concluded. Alien Resurrection is entertaining enough and passes the time but in reality this is the worst film up to this point.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

It is difficult to put my finger on exactly what went wrong, I suspect the script has to bear some of the blame. Also, the villain was not particularly villainous and the heroes were not terribly likable and the aliens failed to instill the brooding menace of the first film, the terrifying vigour of the second or even the vaguely artistic and bizarre nature of the third.

The acting sucked for the most part (except for Ron Perlman, who's always good), there was hardly any plot, and there were continuity errors and plot holes abound. Then there's the ending...all I can say is ""wow"". Joss Whedon, what the blue f#$@ were you smoking when you wrote the last twenty minutes of that movie?

I was thinking: Alien meets ""The Fly 2"". A little silly...If you want to see some Jeunet films, take a look at Delicatessen and City of Lost Children.

Nothing original,"The problem with these stories that develop themselves in several successive episodes is that quality deteriorates from the first on. This saga of the alien monsters doesn't escape this rule. If the first movie was good mainly for the originality of the main theme and the creativity of its conception the following ones became repetitive and mere action movies for lack of ideas(I must say however that I have not yet seen the third one). If you still recall the first movie you may remember that the monsters' image was only suggested by some glimpses which left large field for the viewer's imagination to conceive them. From the moment they began to be shown entirely they lost much of their power to thrill or scare us. This 4th episode has indeed some good and some original ideas. But like someone already said about a certain novel, the good ones are not original and the original ones are not good. The rest is mere action to rivet your attention till the ending which is moreover predictable. There is therefore not much to credit this movie except that it's technically well made but you know the part that computers take nowadays in this kind of sci-fi movies. A final note to say that the acting was not very good with the exception of Sigourney Weaver of course.

Jean Pierre Jeunet gave as an inspiring directing, with an obvious European influence. Sigourney Weaver has once again shown that she is one of the best actresses ever!

The other Alien,"This was quite the ride. Sigourney Weaver had a lot of cloud by this point (deservedly so), but also a weird choice for director (probably) and allegedly studio interference again. The latter is not as obvious as with the third installment. But many people trying to get things they want in an Alien movie ... well the end result couldn't really be another masterpiece.And wo while the previous movie started a sort of decline, this continues the same path - so not really good. After the how the third movie ended you may wonder how Ripley will return for this one ... well the mystery is solved quite quickly at the beginning. Though there is some other revelation saved for later. Still the whole premise is ""bananas"" to say the least. But whatever - and especially if it means we get an Alien 5 sometime in the future after those ""story additions"" from Ridley Scott the last couple of years.Great cast, Weaver having a blast (even if her character is quite inconsistent) - there is enough for any self proclaimed (or otherwise) Alien fan to enjoy here.

Oh how it got so ugly.,"This entire Alien story was originally a very horrifying sci-fi expererience.  As we past the first movie, they seemed to be filled with too much Hollywood action and attitude.  The characters have too much of the macho attitude towards the aliens.  The acting went downhil in this movie, and Weaver isn't fooling anyone with her attempt to be a dark evil human with thoughts of an alien within.  This movie did have a lot of nice close-ups of the aliens and the queen, so if you respect the anatomy of the Alien you should check it out mainly for the effects not the plot, its one of those kind of movies.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Similar to Aliens,"Naturally it would be similar to the other Alien-movies, since it's the last one of them. And even if it's a nice movie, with several nice scenes and plenty of cool special effects, you can't help but to have seen it all before. To me, ""Alien: Ressurection"" is very similar to James Cameron's ""Aliens"" (aka ""Alien II""), but it lacks the nerve and intensity of that film. And while Camerons movie from '86 was packed with new special effects that amazed most viewers, Resurrection doesn't come up with anything new. (Although the scene while they're submerged and they fire grenades under water, is quite cool.)All together, it's a good movie, and it delivers what you'd expect from the last movie in the Alien-series. Just don't expect to see something you haven't seen before from the other threesome. Personally, I would only recommend this movie strongly to those who are die-hard Alien-fans!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Neither underrated nor overrated,"There can be little doubt that Alien resurrection, as a stand alone movie, can be a highly entertaining experience. There is plenty of action, attitude and gore to keep everyone entertained for a few hours. Unfortunately, after all that concludes, one is going to say that the movie sucked and that would be especially true if one has seen the previous three Alien movies.Only Alien and Aliens ever did justice to the franchise. The rest of the series have directors and writers totally confused. They don't know whether to do action or horror and end up doing either one of them, totally failing to achieve anything on the level of either Alien or Aliens. There is of course one director called Paul Anderson who actually made an Alien(vs Predator) comedy movie as well.The entire premise of AR does not appear to be serious. It plays out as a semi-serious flick especially when compared to Alien-3. Some instances of poor CGI have ruined the fright value of the Alien. But the film does try to increase the same through extensive use of violence and gore. While you may be entertained by AR, at the end, you are going to come out, slightly less frightened or intimidated by the Alien, which makes the scope for sequels were unlikely.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Truly one of the best sci-fi action flicks ever,"Alright, there are a bunch of Alien movies out there in the series, but amongst them all, this is one of my favorites. I would say that it's a three way tie between Alien, Aliens, and Alien Resurrection.I'm not going to give any spoilers, or cover the other Alien movies in this note, other than to give vague references for comparison purposes.This movie, in my opinion, was awesome for the following reasons: A female hero along with a female hero sidekick (probably not the best word, but it works for me), which is rare in action oriented movies. It's refreshing to have a female character in the main role in an action movie and I wish that they would do this more often.A great mixture of horror (not as much as the first movie), action (probably not as much as the second movie), and overall dark themes (well, outside of horror) that are in the other movies, but really pushed in this one.The acting, especially considering that this is a sci-fi action flick, is amazing.

A band of smugglers comes aboard only to discover the new race of aliens--and when the multi-mouthed melon heads get loose, no place is safe.

"Aliens2:The revenge - well, no - sorry....","Aliens2 this ain't - and that seems to be the reason for the overwhelming amount of bile that has been heaped upon this film, mostly by American reviewers. You see, this does'nt try to play by the numbers - don't get me wrong, this is not war and peace, but it's not studio kowtowing either. Resurrection manages to take the unintentionally amusing and laughably patchy Alien3 and come up with a plausible way to bring back Ripley from the dead.Now all those expecting Ripley to bond with a cutesy little girl, strap together two guns or get down with her bad self inside a power suit will no doubt feel let down by the new ""alienated"" Ripley that manages to be far more menacing and infinitely more interesting than the old one.All those expecting the Marines to kick Alien butt will also be disappointed - in this film they actually manage to do the more believable thing and vacate as soon as possible rather than provide the Aliens with HostsRus. This Ellen Ripley is unsure who she likes less, the humans or the Aliens - she's unsure of what she is or whether living is worth doing. Ironically enough, it's left to a ""Artificial person"" to sway her.The scene where she discovers the earlier failed experiments is possibly the best in the entire film, let down only by Pearlman's subsequent one-liner. How many of us doubt that if the science was available, that some government or organisation would do this? I don't.The supporting cast works well, whether it's Wincott's sudden death, Hillard sobbing before being the last to go underwater or Wren's complete immorality.The whole idea of the Queen inheriting from Ripley as much as Ripley inherits from her is very intriguing and original. The newborn, whilst not geiger-esqe enough for me, somehow portrays a sense of innocence whether looking for guidance from Ripley or biting Christian's face in half. I found its end disturbing and unconciously put my hand over my mouth. I don't know whether this was well done, needlessly graphic or just plain revolting. Perhaps a mixture of the three.The ending left me a little cold, but as a whole there was the sort of attempt to get inside the Alien (as opposed to the reverse) that the series really needs.Alien remains - by far - the best installment of the series with characterisations that seem very real, claustrophobia and hidden deaths that work better than any amount of snot-splattering explosive effects and a COMPLETE lack of corny one-liners or machoistic attitudes. What it will never be, is the favourite for those that prefer large firearms, big explosions, flashy CGI and largely two-dimensional characters.Resurrection had some good things going for it - not least Jeunet as director - but it's a pity that Dan O'Bannon (Who wrote Alien) did not have more of a direct input.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Only 4 stars may seem a bit harsh...,"Only 4 stars may seem a bit harsh. Particularly to diehard Alien fans who enjoy everything and anything Alien-related.For me, I think part of my 'problem' is that I was around at the beginning when the first films of the franchise were released theatrically. I can remember when the particulars of the Alien concept were new, fresh and exciting. People in space encountering space monsters was hardly a new film concept even when the first Alien film was released. What WAS new was how genuinely innovative and scary the first Alien film was. Unlike its forerunners of the 1950's and 1960's - which were rarely particularly scary, realistic or violent - Alien 1979 was a VERY visceral film. The penetrative nature of the face huggers morphing into the explosive chest bursters which then evolved into the relentlessly vicious and lethal aliens...simply put, Alien 1979 was uniquely in a class of its own. Brutally effective.The follow-up, Aliens 1986, was to my mind one of the few sequels of any genre or franchise that managed to live up to the original. Alien 3 was an honest albeit uneven attempt at making an interesting sequel. The problem from a creative standpoint was the same problem so many movie sequels run up against (and precious few are able to surmount) in that as with so many other things in life oftentimes the first time is the most exciting time specifically BECAUSE it's new, refreshing and unknown. Thus, while Alien 3 DID undertake said honest effort at creating a movie that in many aspects wasn't a slavish carbon copy of either Alien or Aliens, in the end the Alien core concept of face hugger/chest burster/full-size Alien was something the third movie could neither afford to ignore nor was it something the third movie could really do much by way of innovation with, either. Simply put, the third time wasn't a charm. However, a bold - and seemingly final as far as the Ripley character was concerned - ending for Alien 3 at the very least ensured that the franchise would conclude on memorable terms before it had devolved into a pale carbon copy of those core concepts.Well, Alien 3 also made $100 million at the box office. Creative concerns never trump financial ones when there is still a dollar to be made. Which brings us to 1997's Alien Resurrection.Alien Resurrection was the first film in the franchise I was, by and large, just plain bored watching. The cast, even the actors I'd liked in other films, turned in a bunch of mediocre performances portraying characters that I found I had little to no feeling for. As such, I felt little to nothing by way of urgency as to if any of them survived being attacked by the Aliens. The two main characters were a genetic clone and a robot, making identifying with either of them a fruitless endeavor for me as a human viewing the movie. The face hugger attacks elicited a yawning response. The main setting (ostensibly a space-based military research facility which looked basically like the space freighter of the first Alien flick) was overly familiar, as was most everything else in this 4th installment, most of which came across as paint-by-numbers in terms of the plot and script. There was an attempt to evolve the character of Ripley via the clone angle, but Weaver looked as visibly bored onscreen for this 4th go around as I felt watching her.Honestly, the only film in the franchise after Alien 3 that I've semi-liked is Prometheus. Mostly because at least with Prometheus it wasn't the same old Alien core concept trotted out once again. Sadly, after Prometheus the franchise went right back to the traditional face huggers, chest bursters and the traditional full-size aliens, yet minus any memorable human characters one cares about. Now, here in the spring of 2024, I guess there's another Alien flick to come out this summer which is supposed to take place between the events of 1979's Alien and 1986's Aliens...it's called a 'roots film' instead of a sequel. I think I'll opt not to see that flick and instead stay home and...I dunno, maybe take a nap. Or maybe watch Alien 1979...or Alien 1986. Fortunately, those movies still hold up.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disturbingly Interesting,"Alien Resurrection bridges the gap brought about by Alien 3 which was too
detached from the primal fears that the Alien series explores. The aliens
of
the Alien movies are more than routine scary monsters. Alien R. brings
back
our disgust of the alien's parasitic nature and our fear of bodily
violation.I did not see this movie in a theater because I believed that the Alien
franchise had run out of steam. I was wrong. This movie scared me. It left
me with an upset stomach. So why do I watch?I come back to this series first because I am fascinated by good movies
based on the ideas from a short story ""Who Goes There?"" by John W.
Campbell
Jr. which include The Thing, Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Alien.
Alien
R. has all of the horror of birth defects and bodily infection with a new
twist of genetic engineering gone very wrong. As with the first two alien
films, it is a ballet dealing with true horror.My second reason for sticking with the alien movies and liking this one is
Sigourney Weaver. In her role of Ripley she is at least the equal of any
action star period. Her more hopeless attitude about the aliens in
Resurrection is absolutely natural considering what she has been through
and
this obvious fact; these things will not die! It is not due just to the
aliens but to the stupidity of human beings who cannot leave well enough
alone.The other aspects of these films; the deluded scientists, the power mad
bureaucrats, the tough crew members, the gloomy sets are all secondary to
me. Frankly, I believe all of these elements are above average in quality
for a film of this type. Even the peek a boo attacks by the aliens are not
what really holds my interest.It is the fear of what abomination can get inside and emerge from us that
brings me to these films and Resurrection has this in spades.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A disgrace to the series.,"Okay the third one was bad-but this one is just horrible, simply horrible. The first two were sublime-they are two of the best sci-fi movies ever, and have been imitated dozens of times. The third one was just a bunch guys with British accents who you couldn't tell apart running around and getting killed. The third one ruined the series, but at least it was a trilogy. This one not only destroys the trilogy status, but disgraces the series.So lets see where do I start? Well first of all the characters are evil space pirates that have probably killed many innocent people, and you don't really care what happens to them. From the beginning, you can pretty much tell which ones will live and which ones are just there to die. The movie might have been more interesting if it had more people in it, but everyone abandons ship, leaving only a few boring people to entertain us. And of course, in the tradition of Ash and Burke, there's the one bad guy who betrays them-I'm sure we can all guess what happens to him.Then there's the aliens. In my opinion, the second one had the most real-looking aliens because they were animatronic. The aliens in this one were just bad. In this one they lost all their insect-like characteristics which made them creepy. CGI effects haven't quite been perfected yet, so it looks like a cartoon has been inserted into a movie. This one is no exception. The hybrid alien at the end is just plain awful. Words can't describe how incredibly bad it is, but by this point in the film you don't even care anymore. But wait, there's more! After the crew is seemingly safe, the alien comes back for what is possibly the worst moment in film history.This film uses the formula created in Alien and Aliens- [---A group of _______s is trapped on a ______ and is being hunted by______(some kind of monster). During the escape, _______(usually multiple persons) is/are killed by the monster(s). The remaining crew gets to an escape craft, but the monster comes back and is killed by the hero.

I know that Call could have been played by many others, but I think Winona's performance in the film is truly magical, cause she created a person who is both whimsical and innocent at the same time.

It helps Weaver, who does't have to act like she was the only really interesting character in the film (I think the same thing was made by Ian Holm and John Hurt in Alien).

Freaky resurrection,"This is the fourth movie of Alien series. After a disastrous third movie and wasting Ripley, I wonder why they attempted this one. The script is so confusing. In Alien 3 (1992), Ripley had committed suicide by jumping into a huge furnace because she had a baby alien queen in her. In this one - 200 years later - they decide to clone her from her blood sample that was collected from Fiorina 161, the planet where she died. And when they achieve it, she resurrects with the baby alien queen in her. What a genuine piece of script! It would have been more convincing for me, if they had recreated the last scene in Alien 3 with some people spraying water into the furnace and saving her.Otherwise, characters, dialogues and settings are interesting.

Surprisingly good if you're a fan of Buffy...and you realise this is a black comedy,"Personally I put the third Alien film at the bottom of the franchise. On a recent re-watch from the Quadrilogy I realised that it's really quite a decent film but my problem is that it provides nothing to the franchise that Alien didn't already do.Comparatively, while 'Resurrection' isn't a fantastic film in its own right, it is a different sort of film to the others by virtue of being a darkly ironic comedy. The set-up alone is preposterous (to do with cloning and memory-containing DNA) and drives the whole film to be of a different level.Joss Whedon has disowned his script...which is a shame because it smells strongly of his style: We have characters who are sharply defined and somewhat comic book in style, and they are quick to throw out humorous one-liners. Moreover, the sort of tensions between them are the same that we saw in the original Alien film and it adds a little to the feel.There are definitely some terrible aspects to this film: the final act is hampered by some bad SFX and the typical Hollywood thing of ""Okay, everything's got to be BIGGER this time!"" but even so, this film has never deserved the slating it always received and as a fourth film in a series it's certainly winning out by far against crap like Jaws: The Revenge, The Phantom Menace, Police Academy 4 and Superman IV...",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The whole point of the series is to keep advancing the aliens while the humans try and fight ever growing bigger and better bad aliens.

Enjoyable and some morsels to chew on,"I have just seen the Quadrilogy special edition, which has a different opening and ending, and some extra scenes that flesh out some of he characters. I enjoyed it much more coming back to it some 3 or 4 years from having last seen that theatrical cut on DVD. The film doesn't have the visceral impact of either Alien or Aliens. However, it acknowledges Alien 3 and the previous films, and is a film with a very original, weird and surreal style typical of director Jean Pierre Jeunet. Unfortunately the KEY characters are not fleshed out quiet as well as the previous instalments, and only Sigourney Weaver, and Leland Orser, who plays the small role of Purvis, shine. Signourney Weaver, as in the previous two movies, is a standout and brings a new dimension to the character as a resurrected clone. In this special edition an interesting subplot about Ripley's past relationships is touched upon, but unfortunately its never developed to its full and interesting potential. The best part of the film is an outstanding sequence where Ripley confronts the reality of her existence as clone number 8, by seeing first hand the prior research, and it is a sequence right up their with the best of anything else in any of the other films. Leland Orser makes the most of a small part, and actually injects his character with pathos, even if the character's climax is way over the top! The story is interesting, but the film's main weakness is that some of the themes set up are not full explored, hence you do not get the emotional payoff that you get in Alien and Aliens, when subplots are carried through e.g Ash's character in Alien, Bishop's character arc in Aliens. Most characters, Wren, Elgyn ,Perez and Gediman(who is an unnecessarily weird character)come across more as plot devices,so you don't really care for them. However, Winona Ryder's Call is quite sympathetic, and by towards end of the film the characters of Vriess (played by Dominque Pinon) and Johner(played by Ron Perlman) are characters you begin to root for, even if the Johner character starts off as being deliberately dislikable.The action sequences are well done, including a standout sequence underwater. The photography and design, like in all the alien films, are excellent. Visual effects are also excellent, bearing in mind this was the first Alien film to fully embrace CG, and is generally well integrated with the excellent live action animatronics. John Frizzell's music is entirely appropriate to the mood, and continues the tradition of excellent and fresh original scores across all four films.The gore is certainly more obvious than in the previous instalments, and those with sensitive stomachs need to be aware that this is the most gratuitous of the four films. This was another small disappointment, as the horror of the aliens is much more psychological rather than the physical and the film is strongest when the horror is geared towards the implied rather than in your face (which for one character is more than just a metaphor!).My final comment is about evolution. The research of the scientific characters in the story that leads to Ripley's Clone 8 raises some interesting thoughts on the ethics of genetic engineering, and links well into the Ripley Clone's issues about her identity. The idea could have been further explored but nevertheless its good to see these issues being layered into a Hollywood Sci- Fi movie. However, the impact of this research in the story of the evolution of the Alien species is controversial and while I really liked the idea, and of its linkage to Ripley, you'll need to make your mind up about the evolution's physical manifestation, which I was unsure about. This character was also on screen for too short a period, and it was a shame that more time wasn't devoted to this.Overall I was impressed - not a classic, but a very well made and thoughtful, if occasionally weird movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Terrible Alien Movie, A Little Better Than AVP","Alien Resurrection is a HUGE disappointment to the Alien saga. Alien was brilliant, Aliens was different, but still very good and Alien 3 is also a masterpiece. Alien Resurrection can't compare to any of these.

A goofy B-movie comic book throw-away Alien universe film,"A one-off goofy, campy, B-movie comic book throw-away Alien universe film. One last ride but knowing full well the Ripley saga was truly wrapped up in the last one. Again though, as is the case with this franchise, this film has its own personality, look, feel and genre to call its own.Ripley is a superhero now, and she's explained as emotionally autistic so as to not question why she's so benign the whole film (it's clear Whedon knew not to have her slinging quips the whole film, but he didn't know what else to do with her so he turned her into a superhero, surprise). Whedon apparently complained about the delivery of his lines in this film but I don't know. I think most of the actors are game and his dialogue is just OK.The bigger problems are the lazy plotting (really, 200 years in the future the company still wants an Alien and they still weren't prepared for acid blood? or had a contingency plan in place...) and the lack of characterization of Ripley. There's nowhere else to take her. The only interesting thread involves Ripley kind of becoming an Alien queen at the end (there's mention of cross hybrid DNA) but this an end game play and it's interesting, it's just too bad it doesn't take up more room in the overall film.Jeunet is not suspense generator, nightmare-maker, or an action stager. He has some pretty sets, and does well with the beautiful Alien special effects (not the CGI though, shudder). The only indelible image in the whole thing is the final shot of the new white Alien thing getting sucked out of a tiny hole. That looks painful, and it's harrowing to watch - notice that Ripley is almost crying seeing it. It's almost like the film made Ripley a mom again only to have her rip it away from herself, but I'm not entirely sure the film understood that, or knew what to do with it.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Partly good, with horribly bad ending.","What high hopes I had for this film, and how cruelly they were crushed. And it all happened so fast! The first two thirds of the movie are actually quite good. A bit slow-paced, but nevertheless worthy of the Alien concept. Of course, I had hoped for a plot that would have let us see more of the Alien universe; the planets, the military, etc...Anyway, on to the ending, which I HATE. There is no other word for it. I hate the ending, because it violates the one thing that makes the Aliens movies so good - the Aliens themselves!!!The disgusting offspring of the Queen looks like a giant malformed human baby - and yet is more powerful than the queen herself! The Aliens, as you will recall from the first movie, were touted as ""perfect organisms"", something the ugly baby critter is most definitely NOT. Blasphemy!Beside this abomination, the whole ending sequence is filled with cheesy effects and logical gaps the size of Jupiter: PAH!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Ah, the magic of Hollywood!","Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), last seen leaping into a flaming pit in Alien 3, has been brought back from the dead. Seems she was impregnated before her suicide plunge, and we need her alive and breeding for the popular sci-fi/horror series to continue. Ripley, who has been cloned from a blood sample, has just given birth (would you call this a C-section?) to the ugliest little sucker this side of Uranus. Welcome to Alien Resurrection. This fairly engaging sequel may not be as scary as Ridley Scott's Alien or as action-packed as James Cameron's Aliens, but at least Ripley has hair. Weaver gets some good lines and is an energetic force cloning around at the center of this very particular universe. The supporting cast is colorful too, including Brad Dourif, Ron Perlman and Dominique Pinon.  The Frenchman at the helm certainly has a way with atmosphere. Cinematography, lighting and set design are tops. A terrific underwater chase scene also left me breathless. Too bad much of the plot seems jumbled, at times I just wasn't sure for whom I was supposed to be rooting, or why. The drooling, slimy aliens themselves are technical marvels, I guess, but too familiar to be very frightening. One drawback, Winona Ryder, who seemed to have booked a ride on the wrong flight. Here she's just a little girl lost in space. Interesting note, Aliens Resurrection's screenplay is by Joss Whedon, who also wrote TOY STORY. Now that's a change of pace.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
THIS MOVIE HAS EVERYTHING!!!,"OK when I first saw this movie I had never seen Alien, I'd seen maybe half of Aliens and I had turned off Alien 3 after half an hour because I thought it was SOO bad (the CGI alien is a DISGRACE)! But I was at a movie marathon and Alien Res was on so I sat through it - AND LOVED IT!I'm now a massive fan of both Alien and Aliens (Alien 3 still sucks in my opinion and is responsible for killing the 'real' series) but I like each for totally different reasons. Alien has awesome suspense and for its time was completely unique. Aliens has a great story line, brilliant acting and is one of the greatest action films ever!But Alien Resurrection has everything you saw in the first 3 films but wanted MORE of in close up GORY detail!!! There's evil Ripley who is now truly indestructible, evil doctors, surgically removed chest bursters, lotsa army guys with big guns, a pirate ship crew who get slaughtered one by one, aliens swimming, an alien nest, a hybrid alien, clones-gone-wrong, REALLY corny jokes and CHEST BURSTING AND MORE CHEST BURSTING! It is worth seeing this movie just to see one chestburst through a guys head.OK but even more than the violence and corny jokes I love the characters. Basically Joss Whedon has just written another 'scooby gang' but they're great. And the movie makes so much fun of itself its hilarious! The doctors explaining to Gen. Perez why she has memories is absolute gold.If you're not out LOOKING for the greatest movie ever then you'll enjoy this but I can understand why people who were fans of the trilogy saw this and were severely disappointed. I can't say a thing against it though, it has EVERYTHING you could want in an entertaining film.Who'd you think it was gonna be? SANTA CLAUSE??? - Vriess",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A combo of the first three with a couple fresh ideas,"Two hundred years after Ripley's death in the previous film (Sigourney Weaver), she wakes up as a clone in a space station, which also serves as a colossal vessel.

Winona Ryder and Ron Perlman play space pirates while Dominique Pinon and Michael Wincott are leaders at the station. Brad Dourif is on hand as a scientist.""Alien Resurrection"" (1997) is the fourth film in the series and combines elements of the previous three while throwing in a couple of new things. The diverse cast is great but I started to get bored by the end of the first act. Thankfully, the movie perks up with an outstanding underwater sequence that recalls ""The Poseidon Adventure"" (1972), albeit more amped up.The peripheral cast is highlighted by the voluptuous Kim Flowers as Hillard and the formidable Gary Dourdan as Christie. But you just know they're the equivalent of red shirts in Star Trek.If you've seen the first three entries, there's no pressing reason to see this one. It has a been-there-done-that vibe. However, if you appreciate those films and want more of the same with a new cast, ""Alien Resurrection"" is well done for what it is, proficient sci-fi/horror.

"Jean-Pierre? Well, see, a number of us have been wondering... what the heck were you thinking?","I understand that French directors make weird films. In fact, maybe this one's even one of the most extreme in that respect. But this is just... a minor complaint would be events and actions in general that are bizarre, but there also bigger issues. For one thing, so many situations are solved in an unexpected way. Now, kudos for not just taking the easy way out, but it almost comes off as overcompensating, going so far in the other direction that the viewer feels completely disconnected from it... the illusion cracks, and we find ourselves wondering why we're giving this piece of fiction, which at these bits, not so much makes no attempt at convincing us, but more goes out of its way to taunt and push us away. The humor is seldom all that funny, and more often than not common sense is its expense. It should not be thought that Jeunet is not skillful; tension is mustered up(if, as others have said, there is hardly any character development), the creatures, as well as various parts of the movie, are effective. The plot is more or less empty and by-the-numbers once the initial stuff is out of the way(save for one or two ideas and scenes, which admittedly are pretty darn good and interesting), and its overall progression is mostly devoid of surprises(which is not to say that everything herein is figured out ahead of time). Something that, at best, at least nags is how this seems to try to fit in what was in each entry to go before it(which, sooner or later, has got to get to be ridiculous). The effects are great. There are some rather grotesque sights and sounds in this, anyone considering watching should take that into account. The action isn't that involving or entertaining. This did have the worst start-off point, and they did actually manage to work around that, if in a way that is far-fetched. The behavior of the Aliens is somewhat messed up. Furthermore, I wasn't scared of them at... anytime, really. The acting isn't particularly impressive, same goes for some of the character writing(Ripley, what happened to you? Is it the black nail-polish(I know, I know, someone told you it would look wicked)?). Perlman is reasonably cool(but the man probably delivered a one-liner as his first words). The Special Edition, briefly introduced(in less than a minute) by he who helmed this, holds an alternate opening and ending, among other things, and is worth it for those who want more of what this is. The commentary track is also fine to listen to. I recommend this to... maybe more fans of Jean-Pierre Jeunet(as well as Joss Whedon? I... wouldn't know, this appears to be the only thing of his I've seen firsthand) than those who dig the franchise. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
No more please,"* (1 out of 5)Alien ResurrectionDirected by : Jean-Pierre Jeunet, 1997Clumsy, dumb and sputtering sequel has Ripley running around another spaceship, fighting another batch of aliens with help from another group of space pirates and grunts.In hoping to re-energize the `franchise', Frenchman Jeunet takes a turn as director. The alien universe seemed a nice match for him (remember his City Of Lost Children) on paper ¬ñ and like Alien3, Sigourney Weaver had a consulting say on this one too - but the movie is ample proof of how wrong theory can sometimes be.Jeunet is certainly no Cameron and we get drowned in over-achieving visuals on top of a stupefied story (Ripley is cloned some 200 years after her death. Get the picture?).And yes, that's Winona Ryder as the android. The last 20 minutes may actually have Alien fans going suicidal. It's that bad.",,Anonymous,Horror
They just wanted to make more money off the series.,"It was pretty horrible by my standards. Don't get me wrong, the acting wasn't reaallly bad, the special effects were okay (they were actually fine), it just seemed to lack character. It did seem to have a little too much slime and alien guts.

As with most movies, you have to watch it a few times before you catch everything.

ALIEN : RESURRECTION (DIDIER BECU),"What do you do when in the final sequel (Alien 3)commander Ripley ( Sigourney Weaver) is dead and you wanna make an other sequel?

Alien 4 would have been a brilliant movie if the other three weren't around but now it's just a sort of rip-off from a rip-off. But still the movie works and not in the least because it's been directed by Jeunet (maker of Amelie Poulain) as some special effects (the one in where Ripley enters the lab) are superb and it's always nice to see Winona Ryder back as well.

But it's not just her genes but a mixture that includes alien genetic material.  She still looks human but is not, now she can play a killer game of basketball.  Stripped of her humanity Ripley fails to pack the dramatic punch that was so much a critical element of the earlier Alien movies.  And the aliens, well, they are now just another part of the cast, ho-hum.  The plot, and other characters are cartoonish and stereotypical.  What a waste of acting talent!

This movie trades atmosphere for action thus ruining the experience,"It really makes me sad and disappointed to see this movie having better metascore rating than Alien 3. Fans blasted previous movie with all sorts of arguments but seem to speak more positively about this one which is, in my opinion, several levels below it.First three Alien movie have very strong atmospheric elements; they really draw into the story. This one never succeeds in doing that. Character development and slowly building scenes are traded and sacrificed for action and gore. Besides, whole thing feels very sinister and occult. It's no secret that Alien movies have something to do with eugenics (in a particular sense of creating a perfect race) which is clearly visible in this movie and Alien Covenant. While I have no problem with that topic in Alien context, I think they went a little too far with it and with sexuality in Resurrection.Concerning character development, it's done poorly compared to previous Alien movies. First three films were somehow able to develop characters without using too much words instead concentrating on movements, face expressions and similar. Resurrection protagonist, whom I almost don't even remember, say stupid and unnecessary things. Everything feels non-authentic.In conclusion, this is by far the worst Alien movie but still enjoyable as an ordinary action/horror film.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
This resurrection should have been aborted,"I'm not certain of why this film came about. Whether it was because of a desire to end the franchise in a better way after the failure of Alien 3 or just cashing in on the name of a popular franchise. Either way Alien Requiem is a weak addition to the Alien franchise and one that does not live up to the legacy that preceded it.This time it doesn't even feel like a sequel, but rather like a reboot. 200 years after she died, Ripley is resurrected by a mad scientist who wants to use her DNA to create a new form of Xenomorph. But the aliens escape their cage using their acid blood (why they didn't put them in a special jail that wouldn't melt with acid is one of many plot holes) and take over the ship. Thus it's up to Ripley and a group of space bandits to defeat the Xenomorphs before they make it to earth. It's a bizarre story that is alright, but out of place for the tone of the franchise.The idea of space bandits is a good one (as evidenced by the fact Whedon used the same idea later to make the hit show Firefly). But unfortunately it is not executed particularly well here. Each character does have a memorable feature that will ensure you do remember the different characters, but it seems to lack the usual quick witted charm that makes most of Whedon's work so memorable. Whedon states the reason for this is a weak execution of the source material and some script changes after his draft. Possibly this comes from the fact that the director Jean Pierre Jeunet's style does not blend well with Whedon's with his melancholy, dramatic approach not being best suited for the script.Unfortunately just like Alien 3, Resurrection screws up the most important thing in the franchise. The Xenomorphs. Once again we see too much of them. What made them so iconic in the first two is that we hardly saw them. It was the fear of the unknown that made them so memorable. Here they appear a no better than some run of the mill monsters. They never feel as if they're too much of a threat and even their designs are different.On top of this they do some incredibly strange plot points with the Xenomorphs, the strangest coming within the final act. Out of nowhere a Xenomorph/human hybrid is born merging Ripleys DNA with the alien. That sentence alone felt strange to write¬Ö They even attempt to add some drama in to it with the alien viewing Ripley as its mother, even trying to make us feel sorry for it. But when they constantly switch between sympathetic child and murdering monster the whole thing just loses its impact.Ultimately there's nothing in this film that is particularly memorable. There's little reason to watch the film since it doesn't add anything interesting to the franchise. But if you do watch it then don't enter with any expectations.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Ressurection from Alien3, this is not.","Alien Ressurection, we're they taking a pop at Alien3?This film really really struggles and with more time and less problems on the set it could have been very good instead of very mediocre.The story is set 200 years after the events of Alien3 and scientists have obtained dna from Ellen Ripley from the prison planet in Alien3. They then set a about creating a perfect clone of Ripley which for some reason, (didn't the alien pop out before she died?)contains an Alien.

The film may also have done better without the presence of Ripey or do I mean 8, who the whole film seems to be about. A lack of originality, basically this is Alien meets Aliens in a new location and some really strange and arty direction by Jeunet, there are a lot better established in this genre directors e.g. Renny Harlin.But the good, the new born Alien though his conception and birth may seem strange, did offer something original and new. The sets are impecable giving a gothic outlook to the film and then there is the cinematography which looks impressive.I really do hate Johner, who comes out with lines off, ""I don't get it, it must be a chick thing."" and ""I'm not a mechanic, I mostly just hurt people."" and for some reason calls Virese 'Ironside' who people now don't understand so I doubt they will in the far far off future.Will we witness the true Alien Ressurection, it all depends on Alien5.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

What is it that makes it the worst of the series?,"What is it about this film that makes it the weakest of the four Alien films? Visually it's terrific in places.

The music is nice and dramatic and the cast and performances from Weaver, Perlman, Wincott, Dourif, and others are really good too. Some moments of dialogue also put a smile on the face. I quite enjoyed Ripley 8 telling Leland Orser he was going to die and she was the mother for one.So what we have is the basis for a great sequel. Where does it all go wrong? Well the whole concept is just completely ridiculous isn't it. I mean almost every trick that made the first films work (and most other effective action/horror work) is hammered, the main thing being that limited exposure of the actual Alien to keep you on the edge of your seat is gone and here it's practically in every second scene. This nullifies any potential for it to be scary. The final 30 minutes is cringe making at best and since and they didn't even get the science right. I mean, since when does Sulfuric acid dissolve glass? It's a damn shame, because with all the ingredients in the first paragraph in place it had the potential to be better than Alien3 if not as good as the first two.

A lovely joke on Hollywood - viva Jeunet!,"Every time I perceive this marvelously disgusting, erotic, hilarious, and pretty film I enjoy it more than before.  Yet its undeniably different character from the first three films in the series begs addressing.  After my ninth screening, I propose that _Alien Resurrection_ is actually Situationist-influenced cinema.The essence of the 1950s-60s French-based Situationist movement is ""constructing situations"" , a constructed situation defined as:""A moment of life, concretely and deliberately constructed by the collective organization of unitary environment and the free play of events."" --From the journal /Internationale Situationniste/ #1, June 1958Of course that might describe every film ever made; the distinguishing factor methinks lies in both the character of the individual scenes, and their attitude toward the narrative.  The idea of ""constructing situations"" includes the notion of free play of events in a carefully arranged environment.  As far as I can tell, the purpose is to break out of the Spectacular trance by appreciating life in an immediate, sensual way confounding to the intent of cultural or ideological scripts.  An example of Situationist-influenced daily life would be anarchists rearranging billboard messages to expose the advertiser's evil intent,  going out for a walk and intentionally getting lost, etc.In _Alien Resurrection_ , the scenes were the thing.  The scenes often seemed directionless, haphazard, the acting even a bit fake, as if a troupe of really good improvisation actors had been given a particular situation, setting, music, costumes, and roles, and were told to work out what would happen, stretching it out to fill a particular time.  The cinematography lends a glow to the surroundings, like an aura of meaningfulness, that prettifies everything.  The score undulates unpredictably, imbuing piecemeal *deja vu.   In other words, it's as if they have, in a Situationist sense, constructed various situations out of which beauty unfolds, and the actors themselves experience this necessarily.  Indeed, from the various actors' commentaries, describing, for instance, the vaunted underwater scene, or the thrill of working with famous actors in a celebrated film series, it seems as though it was as much if not more fun and interesting to actually act in it as it is to perceive it on the screen.  The final product proceeded without flowing, scenes appeared interchangeable, the plot primarily an excuse for generating a series of well-done Situations.  In doing so, it's natural the work dismantles the ""ideology"" as it were of the first three films, and rearranges the elements to its own liking, for its own ends, in the service of situations.In this light, the disjointedness of the film becomes a focussing device, a hint of where not to look.  The joys of the film, as both apologists and reluctantly won over fans in varying degrees realise, flow from appreciating the various impressive situations, not from an elaborately engaging plot. Contrast with the intense, simple plot of A1, the well-rounded helping of plot and character in A2, and the muddling of both qualities for the sake of a well-stirred mood in A3.  Perhaps this degrades A4, or perhaps not.  If my proposition is correct, this not only paints the Alien Saga in a more subversive colour than hitherto appreciated, but also plays one of the largest jokes in cinematic history on the film studio that made it.  If _Alien3_ was a fifty-five million dollar art film, _Alien Resurrection_ must be nothing less than an eighty million dollar Situationist film. (!)  As such, of course, the title gains another significance...that of ""resurrecting"" Situationist ideas into the popular imagination, nested within the heart of the spectacle itself.  If it's true that, in keeping with rumour, Jean-Pierre Jeunet will never make another Hollywood film, it's certainly no wonder why not!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Things don't stay as plan when they escaped while the Queen is breeding a new kind of alien.Written by Joss Whedon, the guy who wrote Buffy, Firefly, Toys story and so on; this guy got his own fans ‚Äì whatever he does or he touches turn into gold for them. Sadly it ain't me, I see movie for what it is. And despite the great potential in this movie ‚Äì it fail.I do not blame Joss for this failure since there seem to be quite a change in the script and how it was executed. But overall there ain't anything much in the storyline to hold on to. It was kinda lame and predictable storyline (maybe in 1997 it was awesome, but in 21st century it wasn't ‚Äì it was dated). The only memorable scene might be the underwater fight (still, it last only few minutes).What I suspect was there has been a great influence from the studio to change the feel of the movie (almost half of budget has been cut) and the story and production design has been change. The movie feels like an ordinary - man versus extraterrestrial movie and not an ALIEN movie. It is not much of a thriller ride anymore.Anyway I don't get why they always give to the project to the unknown director (first it was James Cameron, and then it was David Fincher, now this - Jean-Pierre Jeunet). (James only did Terminator and Piranha) (David only did commercial before that) (Jean can't even speak English ‚Äì maybe that is the reason he can't communicate with the rest of the crews and casts).Overall the movie lacks the very ALIEN feel of the first three that very unique in its own way. This was very commercial. The story was weak and the execution wasn't very plane movie ‚Äì nothing really stand out. Not even the newly hybrid Alien that suppose to be one of the most fearsome creature in the universe. It was disappointment.Recommendation: Sure why not, it wasn't all bad if you have low expectation and not compares it to its predecessor.Rating: 5/10 (Grade: C-)",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A little to gory, and too few scary moments. ** out of ****","ALIEN: RESURRECTION (1997) **Starring: Sigourney, Winona Ryder, Dominique Pinon, Ron Perlman, and Gary Dourdan Director: Jean-Pierre Jeunet   Running Time: 109 Minutes   Rated R (for strong gruesome sci-fi violence and gore, and for language)By Blake French:""Alien Resurrection"" does not carry the tradition brought to us with ""Alien,"" years ago. This film is contrived, flat, and relies heavily on special effects and enormously gruesome creature attacks to pull the movie through a lengthy running time of nearly an hour and fifty minutes. Sure, the visual atmosphere, special alien effects, and science fiction action are all impressive, and I liked much of the film thanks to those elements. I did not care for the movie, however, for many reasons. Mainly due to the absence of a story line beyond scene after scene of violent behavior.The story takes place 200 years after the last ""Alien"" movie. Ripley has been cloned from a drop of her blood and is still the main character. All this takes place on a massive space ship, where the government wishes to breed alien for medical reasons.  Most of the movie takes place on a freighter ran by a homeless crew. Something goes wrong, aliens break out of their restraints, and wreak havoc on most of the members of the crew. However, they have Ripley with them to explain what is going on. One of the group members is named Annalee Call (Winona Ryder), whose identity may not be what it seems. She and the rest of the band are placed in situation after situation with a simple gimmick of how they must reach their way back to earth without aliens on board. Most of the production is spent detailing these situations, and at times, perhaps in a little too much detail.Some of the film's violence gores a little over the edge at times. Lets say an individual excepts the fact that aliens tare off and or crush victims' heads frequently, as well as doing their gobble de gook scare scenes when they kill no one. There are even murder scenes under water, obviously taking some pointers from ""Jaws."" And the stomach churning suction sequence in space where the aliens and the last of the remaining humans are placed on a shuttle, will stick with you long after the ending credits roll by. This is not a movie for the faint of hear, young, or squeamish.Most of the performances were modicum satisfactory, but none were anything noteworthy. Sigourney Weaver is surely running out of energy with the Alien series, and seems a bit lost here. Winona Ryder suffers from the exact same syndrome. Her character inhabits such a big twist near the end of the film, it is a shame that it isn't very effective. Since characters are such in lacking of humanity, and the aliens are so brilliantly crafted, it is hard not to root for the monsters here.Brought to you by 20th Century Fox.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
I love French sense of humor!,"If ""Alien"" by Ridley Scott wasn't the first and original, I would say that ""Resurrection"" was the best one from the series. The first movie was full of suspense. ""Aliens"" were complete failure - no ideas just a lot of shooting. Third part was very picturesque and poetic. Fourth is just funny and dynamic! If you like the kind of black humor used in ""Delicatessen"" or ""City of lost children"" you will find yourself laughing hard at some moments (unless you're American and can hardly catch the kind of intelligent European humor bursting from this movie) I am not a die-hard fan of Aliens, but it *IS* one of my favorite movies, and having all four of them at home ""Resurrection"" is my most frequent choice, right after ""Alien 3"".",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
I know exactly who you are and where you came from,"Wow, this movie is way better than Aliens 3 and this movie is a piece of crap! Like a bicycle with one wheel is better than a bicycle with no wheels, because you could at the least have a unicycle and unicycles are so stupid. Like when I see a busker on a unicycle doing stupid crap like juggling or swallowing swords or like breathing fire, I don't know, I still know that goon on a unicycle is way better than any magician, which is also known as a bike with no wheels. Magicians are terrible and so is Aliens 3, and if you're thinking I should just write a review of Aliens 3 instead of lazily trying to make this about Alien Resurrection, I already wrote a review of Aliens 3 ( fade out on my maniacal laughter ).",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Amelie Resurrection,"After watching again Alien, Aliens, Alien3 and Alien Resurrection in a row my personal preference has changed. Now, I prefer Alien 3 over Resurrection. So, my personal ranking is Aliens, Alien, Alien3 and Resurrection.
I am not sure why today Alien Resurrection looks weird, FX looks cheap and the movie itself is a weird mixture of comic-tragic boring Alien story. Also, the ending is the weakest of all the movies. Give me a break.
On the other hand I still choose Alien and Aliens as my TOP 5 favorite movies of all time.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nice one And better than alien 3,First of all don't get biased over other movies because they are not as great as aliens. Even that one's my fav too yet this movie tried their best no to make a disaster like the previous part. Alien 3 was worst of all and I expected even worse with this one but it's better and along with my fav I would keep Aliens in #1 position alien in #2 and #3 this part if it's not a cameron movie then don't expect it to be a masterpiece like the one cameron made,8.0,Anonymous,Horror
When alien hillbilly cousins mate - a ugly mess is born,"Dear oh dear or dear - Sad face.What the hell happened?What was that?What did they do to it?Those were just some of the things that I thought after watching this film. There were more things I was wondering, but such expletives would get me banned from reviewing films on here so I can't write them. This was slightly annoying, slightly horrible and a bit weak too.So, 200 years after Ellen Ripley sacrificed herself for the good of humanity to make sure Aliens didn't become a menace to the universe, she is reborn. A clone of her is created in order to extract the Alien that she was carrying. In recreating her, the alien she was carrying is also recreated. Unfortunately as they both share one body the DNA gets a little mixed up and they both become part of each other. The ship where she was created is attacked by hijackers/ protesters/ smugglers and becomes unstable subsequently freeing aliens. She forced into teaming up in order to survive, in teaming up she learns information that puts her in a conflicting position that tests her allegiances.Amongst some of the other questions I had were; why contain aliens with acid for blood, in containers that aren't acid proof? Why have autopilot sequences that return the ship to earth the minute the aliens escape? What is plan B for emergencies - or is plan B just run for your life and hope to escape? Also, Winona Ryder - why? In the world of sequels this feels like ""Batman and Robin"" - it's almost cartoon and colourful in its appearance, it contains stupid segments that add nothing to the plot or universe, and it might as well have nipples on the alien suit (a-la Batman). Sure there are worse film in the world, but for a franchise that had so much potential in the first films and in novels and comics - this is served up as a lite version of aliens which looks like it's just there to gross some money from fans willing to pay for anything Alien related. It's formulaic; it's ill-conceived, woefully executed. Maybe as stand-alone film you find on the Sy-Fy or Horror channel this works, in the franchise of Alien films, not. 5 out of 10 is a bit kind but this review has found me on a good day.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
The best sequel ever!,"I have always loved the Alien series and Alien Resurrection couldn't have been better! AR would've s*cked without Ripley and I am grateful that the producers brought her back. Nonetheless, there's a major difference between this installment compared to its predecessor (Alien 1, 2 & 3); the characters have more powerful weapons to kick those aliens' ass! I loved Ron Perlman's character, at first he acted like a total jerk (on the Betty) but later he turned out to be a good guy! However, I felt sorry for both the queen and her newborn, as they were both killed. (The newborn killed the queen and then Ripley killed the newborn). I even find it laughable in the scene where the aliens have escaped and one of them sneaked into the escape pod and killed all the soldiers. As for the ending, I didn't like it a bit!! WHY did the alien have to be sucked out of the spaceship?? And HOW did it get aboard? Like in Alien and Aliens, no explanation is offered as how did they managed to sneak in and then in all of a sudden, they showed up from nowhere and jumped on their preys! I certainly hope this sequel is the conclusion to the Alien series and please, NO Alien 5, let Ripley retire for God's sake!!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""She'll Breed. You'll Die""","Turns out Sigourney Weaver actually made that basketball shot on the last take as she walked off the set.

Rule of Eights,"Why do we watch Alien movies?  Truth to be told, it's the production design.The Alien movies don't have an original style, but rather are amalgamations of lesser elements.  With ALIEN it was Halloween and It! Terror from Beyond Space.  ALIENS was Rambo and Ghostbusters.  ALIEN3...well, I can't really see any large elements taken into it other than Rosemary's Baby.  With our beloved ""Resurrection"", Jeunet infuses too much French style reminiscent of The Fifth Element, Starship Troopers, and Species.  Of course, traces of Resurrection are evident in everything ranging from Dark City to the Matrix.Perhaps another big problem with Resurrection is that it is less functional and utilitarian like the original Trilogy and more modern, too futuristic. There is technology, but no understanding of it.  Cameron had the opposite problem in ALIENS of making an overabundance of hardware and trying to spend too much time explaining its operation.  At least he paid that much attention to detail.  Resurrection is 1/8 as powerful.Next, DO THEY CALL THAT CREATURE DESIGN?!  The first two movies were a miracle in the design phase--the second getting my favor for improving the appearance.  ALIEN3 started the overuse of CGI that plagues this movie...""Yeah, real scary.  Hit the 'delete' key and alien goes adios."" Here the creators tried inserting too much style (and slime) into the creatures that make it less animalistic and more cartoonish.  It is 1/8 as creative as the original.I'm certain Jeunet is proudest about the Queen birth scene near the end.  So much of his French style and method are visible in contrast to Cameron and Scott's darkness method.  Bright moody colors are prevalent compared to the subdued hues of the first two...Luc Besson must have noticed.  In that sense, this is 8 times brighter than the first movie.By comparison to ALIEN3, Resurrection still fails because it stays too far into familiar territory.  Perhaps Fincher knew that his style was going to be the future of the series...so he killed it then and there.  Too bad the studio didn't agree.Overall, Resurrection has cinematography power (and more gore than the Original Trilogy combined) and little else.  The characters are typical--evil scientist, obvious android, tough black guy, and stupid white male reminiscent of Hudson from the second movie--the plot is worse, and the production design falters because computers aren't as good at replicating environments like miniatures and mattes.  1.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Horror
How to Bake a Cake,"How to bake a cake. Go to Walmart. Buy Duncan Hines cake mix. Also buy whatever else you are told, by the instructions on the box. Bake cake. Smear with that icing, in the cardboard can. You won't get anything new or unusual. But no one will argue that you have baked what everyone will agree is a standard, run-of-the-mill, usual cake. That's this movie. Everyone mentions the ugly, monstrous aliens. Everyone mentions the gore. No one mentions the other horrible aspect which is explored. That is, the melding of one's mind, with other minds. And having one's mind controlled by something or someone else. It is a form of death, in that it is the loss of self. And maybe movies contribute to that. Who knows? Seen on Tubi, the free streaming site, which now has live TV.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
ways too underrated,"the fourth part of the alien saga belongs to the most underrated sci-fi- movies. obviously, it got this sequel stigma, but under this surface is more then just a sequel. there is a brilliant storyline that deals with philosophic matters without being too ... intellectual. the movie negotiates human existence: we see different ¬õconcepts¬ã or versions of the human being. man, clone, robot, the crossbreed of man and alien. man is not gonna earn a right to survive. he is presented as the most inhuman of these versions. and its the robot and the clone, that gonna save the earth from the alien. the movie doesn't answer this question and it doesn't have to. the question leaves a bad taste (in a very good way), thats worth 10 points. truly, the movie is not as dark as the previous parts. i see it as an advantage, that its not gonna copy the darkness. that it de-gigers the appearance of aliens, without getting rid of a special, still remaining feeling of imprisonment and exoticism.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Lost me immediately,"Okay, they've cloned Ripley. I can buy this. However, they've seemingly somehow even managed to skip the years of growth from infancy to adulthood. Okay, maybe the could do that. However, the fact that she is speaking falls beyond my ability to suspend disbelief: although we are born with the ability to develop language, one must be input, it is not native to the brain. The clone would also have no recollection of her progenitor's life or experiences. Under any circumstance, the alien is not part of her genetic makeup, therefore cannot be growing inside her. This would be akin to growing a cow from my DNA because I have eaten one, or a dog because I rubbed one's belly.Having lost me at the outset, the film following the exposition has gone unwatched.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Budget $75M; box office $161MThank goodness this movie was better than the 3rd one (which was absolute GARBAGE and got a 1/10 from me).This 4th movie was definitely not as good as the first two (gave them both 10/10), but this 4th movie is refreshingly good. Sigourney Weaver - she brought her A-game, as usual, She always brings it.The third movie - killed the protagonist. Who does that? I guess they wanted to literally kill the possibility of a longer franchise? This movie seems to have tried to fix SOME of the things the 3rd one did wrong. It brought back the protagonist, took the setting to a ship designed similarly as in the first two movies (minus the dark visuals), and it even gave us 3 good supporting cast to become attached to, and a final battle.However, where this movie went wrong was with the fact that it had too much lighting and basically no darkness so it failed to create that famous dark visual appearance of the first two films. The aliens were shown with too much lighting and that was wrong since what makes the aliens so memorable is the fact that the aliens emerge from dark places and from shadows. The first scene when the aliens are introduced was perfect - it was very dark and the camera shots were very close to the aliens' faces and bodies; it was perfect. But the next scenes had too much lighting and that was the wrong thing to do; showing their whole bodies with a lot of light was wrong. The director and cinematographer failed here because it was their job to create a dark and creepy visual atmosphere, and to have the aliens emerge from dark places and shadows; but they failed to do this.Supporting Cast:
There is a 7-person squad of mercenaries but only three had good character development and the other four were forgettable.Winona Ryder (the short-haired girl) - she had the best character development in the supporting cast. Good acting too. Loved her performance.Dominique Pinon (wheelchair guy) - great casting choice. I had zero issues with his performance. I wish he had played a bigger role though. Would it not have been cool to see a badas* guy in a wheelchair shoot up some aliens?Ron Perlman (Hellboy) - he should have been the leader of the squad; why the **** was he not the leader? He had all the traits of a leader. Not making him the leader definitely cost this movie some points. It just did not feel right for Perlman to not be calling the shots. What a blunder in casting!!! He could have offered so much more to this movie; such a shame.The other cast members I was not impressed by at all. They had very minor roles and were easily forgettable.One thing that made the 2nd movie so good is that the supporting cast was properly chosen and the audience actually cared about their fate. So as expected, in this movie I only cared about those characters that were given at least some decent amount of character development (short-haired girl, wheelchair guy, and Hellboy). I actually really liked these three cast members and I am glad that they did not _____ at the end.The monster - it looked cool and terrifying, but it just was not what an Alien is supposed to look like or be. It did not even attack like an alien or move like one. It was a totally different species. However, I was very impressed at the fact that the hideous and despicable monster was able to evoke sympathy and pity from me. That was very impressive and the final scene was difficult to watch because I somehow cared for the monster? I am impressed the writers and everyone who made this scene were able to evoke these emotions from me.Plot - I did not really mind the creative route of this story. I thought it was fine.Conclusion: not as good as the first two, but astronomically better than the third one. This movie can hold its own. It gave us a protagonist and three supporting cast to cheer for and care about. This movie did many things right that were done in the first two movies. The plot is acceptable. The ending was strong and felt right. Any alien fan should definitely watch this one.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Space garbage,Nope. Didn't like this at all.Every now and again I will watch the whole franchise and I will watch resurrection as part of that but I wouldn't reach for this movie any other time.There are two things I like about this movie: the Xenos look good and I enjoyed Brad Dourif. I can't say much else for this movie besides that.I don't like the space pirates. I don't like the Ripley clones. I don't like that they found any DNA in the furnace from Alien 3.I didn't like the acid spitting.I didn't like the human xeno hybrid.I didn't like that it's still a surprise that there's an android.This movie has no place in the Xenoverse and I do not consider in cannon.,4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"An Unnecessary Sequel that never Dazzles,","Alien: Resurrection is a poor film with a really mediocre storyline and a decent cast that weren't enough to make this any better. There are certainly impressive visual and special effects, but that means nothing when it isn't one bit captivating, the story is formulaic, it's the fourth film in the Alien series and really feels like that, a film that was only made to make a bit of money. Sigourney Weaver is the only returning cast member as her character is resurrected 200 years after the events of the third film, but this interesting and unique set up never manages to bring any real excitement, Weaver's heart wasn't in the performance, it was clear she didn't want to do this movie. It also tends to drag far too often, investing too much time on a certain scene and over developing characters that no one cares about, it focuses a lot on Winona Rider's Call, easily one of the most irritating characters in sci-fi history, the writers clearly struggled to make her likable and never achieved that goal. Alien 3 wasn't outstanding, but it's just as good as Alien or Aliens in comparison to this mess, Alien: Resurrection is s boring, slow and underwhelming fourth installment.A replicated Ripley must fight the creatures once again in the far distant future.Best Performance: Ron Perlman",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
The best episode,"I am not a horror film fan, but I liked Alien and Aliens, and after seeing the third episode, I thought, it can only get worse. (That was really bad.) But this episode has become my favourite: a lot of action as in Aliens, good characters, (I can't remember any significant character from the first three episode except for Ripley and the droid from Aliens.) Great effects and music. Some deeper thoughts and original ideas unmatched in the first three parts. It had more and finer humour than I-III together. The plot was more original than that of the previous ones. But I think best of all was the choice of the director. Dejeunets french charmeand humour was a real plus.

I heard the sigh,"I think the best moment of the whole Alien saga is when Allien ReplEye starts to cry after destroying the last monster through the window crack. The idea with the blood is excellent too. I only stared at the face of the last alien because I am sure I have seen him somewhere. Either in Brno here PM polcse (similar to Derek Riggs cover for Iron Maiden XFactro) or in Prague at a concert in 2000 PJ Jeremy. So I do not really know what to think about it. I do not like the face of the last monster, it is really unsympathetic discharacter. I am sure it is some kind of enemy that is hard to destroy and get rid of... It must be either in our minds or it walks through the streets at nights when everybody is scared of mist or whatever... I do not really know. It is all so confused.

"Despite some merits and the effort of the director and cast, it is the weakest of the Alien films.","This was the fourth film in the Alien franchise, and the last one for many years. The franchise started well and developed nicely into three films that, while not without criticism or problems, work really well and have a lot of coherence as a joint work. The fourth film, unfortunately, completely breaks with this coherent and harmonious union.Jean Pierre Jeunet has done a pleasant and undoubtedly strong job. It is one of the films that made the director's career and that we remember when we talk about him. And there is no doubt that he managed to prevent this film from being even worse, putting great effort into his work, coordinating his technical team and guiding a strong and highly competent cast.Sigourney Weaver is back with the character that launched her career, despite the very understandable reluctance to accept the project (after all, Ellen Ripley had died in the immediately preceding film). She herself stated, without any fuss, that she agreed to do the film because she was handsomely paid. I don't blame her. For an actor, who lives off the jobs he's called to, and who never quite knows when they'll appear, it's important to accept lucrative opportunities. And we have to be honest, the actress committed herself to the work and did everything to give us a performance at the same level as we have seen in previous films. However, she unfortunately did not have been material with the same quality. Winona Ryder, who was experiencing a particularly happy period in her career, is also here, and she also gives us a very reasonable job, although far from matching the great performances she achieved in other films of the same period. Ron Perlman, fairly unknown, is in good shape, as is Brad Dourif.On a technical level, the film is frankly inferior to its predecessors, and considering that all this is a set that should be cohesive and homogeneous, it is difficult not to make some comparisons. It's a film that continues to rest solidly on very strong visual and special effects, which are very reasonably done considering the age of the film and what has gone before it. It's not as spectacular as its predecessors, and any originality has been lost, but it's not bad, and it's worth seeing. Unfortunately, for a horror film with monsters on the loose, the action scenes are sparse, and seem very weak copies of what was done in the other films (to give an example, this film also has an alien sucked through a hole, in a very similar way to what happened in the first film). The tension and suspense are still present, and it's a truly unnerving film, which can be unsettling for some people. However, the really effective scares are few, even if it is a more visual and bloody film than its predecessors. An excellent cinematography helps to set this all up reasonably well.Between merits and demerits, what really has no salvation is the script. The story we see in this film, in my opinion, not only has a very poor articulation with the films that preceded it, but actually ends up contradicting them. All it takes is to bring back to life, through a rather lame artifice, a character we saw to die with dignity. If this film needed Ellen Ripley - and indeed it needed, she was the character who gave the previous films its strength - the most logical thing was not to make a sequel, but a prequel or a spin-off with a story that was credible and logical, considering what was already done.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
