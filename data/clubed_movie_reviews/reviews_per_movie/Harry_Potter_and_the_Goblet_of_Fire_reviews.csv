"See the movie for action, read the book for story","It's unfortunate that so much of the book needed to be cut for time and the movie is still nearly 2 1/2 hours long. The rule of movie editing is when you must trim for time you remove the sub-plots. A lot of story and character development isn't there.But what is there is a great visual treat. If the movie leaves you with questions just read the book or get the audio version on CD. It would have taken a minimum of another half hour to flesh the movie out and that simply wasn't going to be done by a studio whose primary target is a younger audience. (Note how no studio wants to release an animated film longer than 90 minutes for this reason.) Perhaps Alphonso Curon would have done a better job of cohesion but there really isn't much more that could have been done in the time and the script would have been essentially the same. This movie begs for an extended Lord of the Rings type DVD, another 30 to 60 minutes to give you what was left out for theatrical release.See it and spend the bucks to see it on the big screen.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Shortest 2.5 hour movie,"Mike Newell is forgiven for cutting out so much detail from the book, and JK Rowling is forgiven for writing wonderfully rich books. However, fans of the book cannot help but feel like riding a roller coaster that is so fast there is no time to enjoy the ride. I predict the huge void between book and movie will spur remakes in about 10 to 20 years. Even if the movies must be 5 hours long, Harry Potter fans are willing to sit through them. This movie doesn't get a 10 because it leaves me feeling like something is missing, but it does deserve a 9 for being the best possible portrayal of the book given a 2.5 hour limitation. All said and done, this is the shortest 2.5 hour movie I have ever watched.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Good though rushed,"Based on one of the best books of the Harry Potter series, the film adaptation of 'Harry Potter and the Goblet' had a lot to live up to and I think it succeeded. As Potter fans will know, in GoF, Harry is now fourteen and in his Fourth Year at Hogwarts. When an ancient tournament between Hogwarts and two other European wizarding schools is held that year, a Seventh Year contestant is chosen from each school to compete but things go dramatically awry when Harry, three years too young to even be entered in the dangerous and challenging tournament, is somehow also chosen after his name is mysteriously nominated. GoF is a sharp turning point in the books as the tone darkens considerably and the characters themselves change from being rather wide-eyed innocent children to adolescents thrust the turbulent, uncertain adult world where being 'good' or even an innocent will not guarantee your survival. This shift is also reflected in the film, which was rated 12A (PG13 for Americans), the first of the HP films to be rated so high.I have to say I did enjoy this film, although Prisoner of Azkaban remains my favourite of the four. Unlike the first two films, this did not attempt to condescend as much to small children in the audience. The tasks of the Triwizard tournament captured most of the thrills of the book, particularly the second water-based task where the merpeople were suitably creepy (now we know why none of the kids go swimming in the summer term!), but the first task over-ran for a minute or two more than needed. Light romance was touched upon yet wasn't over-emphasised and the Yule Ball will please those who enjoyed the scenes in the book but audience members over the age of sixteen might find teens ogling each other a tad dull (Hermione is very out-of-character and the scene does drag).The acting of the adult cast is, of course, exemplary as always. Alan Rickman's Snape may only have had four or so scenes but he definitely made his presences known while Maggie Smith really captured the essence of McGonagall. Many people do miss Richard Harris' Dumbledore but I found that Michael Gambon has done an excellent job of moulding the role to make it his own. In GoF, Dumbledore feels very human in the way he carries the weight of the wizarding world on his shoulders and though he struggles at times, his concern for his pupils is paramount. I finally felt the close rapport between Dumbledore and Harry in this film that was missing in the previous three HP flicks. However, the prize has to go to Brendan Gleeson for his scene-stealing depiction of Mad-Eye Moody. Gleeson clearly enjoyed illustrating Moody's dangerous, feral edge.The younger cast have also grown into their roles, improving from their previous outing. Rupert Grint, usually used to playing a comical and stupid Ron, had the chance to cut his acting teeth and show Ron's darker, bitter side and he did well. The Phelp twins have also improved dramatically. No longer do they come across as wooden cut-outs just reading from a cue-card and instead they are able to show the mischievous spontaneity of the Weasley twins. And I look forward to seeing more of Matthew Lewis, who was great at showing Neville's sensitive side without making him too klutzy. Out of the younger cast, though, Dan Radcliffe is the one who has progressed the most. In PoA, he was awful in the 'he was their friend' scene so he seems like another boy in the harrowing graveyard scene and the aftermath, depicting Harry's anger, feelings of vulnerability and grief. He still stumbled on occasion in other scenes but I, at last, have faith he might be able to do the Harry of 'Order of the Phoenix' justice when the time comes.The film did lose points on a few issues. Although most of the young cast have expanded their acting skills as they have gone on, Emma Watson is waning. She has a tendency of over-enunciating her lines and being too melodramatic, which worked in 'The Philosopher's Stone' when Hermione was condescending and childishly bossy, but is just annoying by this point. She spent most of the film sounding as if she was on the verge of tears or in a hormonal snit, even in scenes which were not remotely sad or upsetting. There was also a choppy feel to the film, as if Steve Kloves struggled to properly condense the book into a two-hour film. Those who haven't read the books will have missed quite a bit and those who have read the books will feel the film is very rushed. Molly Weasley and the Dursleys were also missed, especially since I think Julie Walters would have been exceptional in the Molly/Harry interactions that take place aftermath of the graveyard scenes of the novel as the film didn't round off in a manner that reflected a boy had died and Harry would be traumatised by what he saw.I think most Potter fans will enjoy this although they will remark that it could have been better. Non-fans will also get something from this film as I imagine it is hard not to be captivated by the many action and dramatic events but they may find themselves muddled by the story. I would recommend that parents of young children either keep away or, at the very least, check out the film firstly before deciding if their child is old enough to cope with it. When I went to see it, there was a small lad of four or five being dragged along and in the middle of a particularly fearsome incident, the silence of the moment was cut by a wee voice crying, 'Mummy, I'm scared' so, parents, be warned.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Dark and engrossing!,"I liked this film very much. It is much darker than the previous outings, but not as faithful to the source material. The only thing I didn't like so much about the book, was the subplot about Hermione trying to help house elves. It was cute, but interfered too much with the dark overtones of the narratives. The film looks dazzling, especially the ballroom scene. Speaking of that scene, I adored that dress that Hermione was wearing, Emma Watson looked unrecognisable in that scene.Also the music by Patrick Doyle this time was beautiful. I don't think it's as dark as the book, and I wasn't too keen on some of the casting. Roger Lloyd Pack and David Tennant were fine in their roles as the Crouches, but their characters were changed significantly. I did wish they made Crouch's disappearance more mysterious, instead of giving it away, ruining the suspense that was quite compelling up to that scene. I am not too keen on Michael Gambon's Dumbledore, I just don't remember Dumbledore being violent as they made him. As I've said already, I much prefer Richard Harris as the character. I am also on the fence about Mad Eye Moody. Brendan Gleeson is a very talented actor, evident in films like In Bruges and The General. He looked the part, but his voice wasn't exactly what I had in mind for Moody. I have listened to the audio tapes by Stephen Fry, and I imagine Moody's voice as low and gravelly. Although Gleeson mostly succeeded with his role, I personally think he tried too hard. My brother also noted that he didn't like the execution of the three tasks. I didn't like the third task, and the other two were fine. I did think on a positive note that Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort was suitably scary, and with the exception of Dumbledore everyone else was well done. All in all, a flawed but quite engrossing film, that doesn't quite live up to the darkness of the book. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
HP4,"While Prisoner was a step forward I alway felt like the film adaptation of Goblet was a step back simply due to time. Goblet really should be longer to cover all the stuff going on here. Yes, we have the games but in order to do that right the whole movie has to be about that. There's not enough time to explore all the other stuff going on here, the relationships shifting and adapting, the mystery of what's going on. None of this feels more epitomized than in the relationship of Ron and Harry. Best buddies up until now and yet, suddenly they're fed up with each other. I understand the reasoning of it all but it doesn't feel like the film is allowed to live in that enough to make the reactions feel reasonable or earned.Goblet of fire is still decent, it just doesn't feel like a step forward for the series. It's entirely necessary but doesn't progress or amp up in a meaningful enough way. Not that it really matters because at this point you're likely 3-4 movies in and you're either going to see this through or you're not. Just know that it gets progressively better from here.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Best Potter Yet,"I'd hate to face the task of condensing a 700 page book into a movie - even a two and a half hour movie, but they've managed pretty well with this installment of the adventures of Harry Potter.For fans of the movies, you'll find this installment a little darker, a little grittier, and a little more involving. The characters are growing up and are now facing more adult situations with more adult outlooks.For fans of the books, you should find this adaptation a commendable reflection of Rowling's tale. Naturally, some parts had to be modified or cut entirely - there's no way to avoid that without making it a 10 hour movie - but the parts that were cut were either not critical to the story line, or will be easy to account for in the films to come. Unless you're an obsessive nitpicker about every last detail, you should find this a satisfactory film version of Goblet of Fire.Goblet of Fire works well as a stand-alone film, as a film version of Rowling's book, and is in my opinion quite easily the best Potter movie yet.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Fine capturing of the spirit of the book.,"I went to see the movie with three of my four kids this weekend, we were hoping that it would not drag, being so long. Having read the book, my oldest and I knew it was a long story with much to cover. Though there could have been traps to make it drag, we were very pleased with the fine way they found to smoothly link everything together and not lose the spirit of the things they had to leave in the book. We did enjoy the third HP movie, though we did find this one to be vastly more appealing to the movie series. This was a fine movie and all involved with its creation and presentation to the big screen for our enjoyment deserve kudos. Special effects were wonderful, and the devotion to the written story was exemplary! We only wish it would have been shown on our stealth cinema with stadium seating instead of the standard screen. Other than that, Ten stars for sure.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Goblet Lives up to the Hype!,"Wow! What can I say? I've been waiting a year and a half for this movie and I can tell you that it was Definitely worth the wait! Even though Daniel, Rupert and Emma are much older than 14 (it's pretty obvious) they are so convincing as they learn about their feelings of maturity:) The selection ceremony for the Tri-Wizard tournament was humorous. The look of shock on certain characters faces is unforgettable! The tasks are fun and exciting even though I already knew what was going to happen! I thought that the Yule ball was absolutely spectacular, and Ron's dress robes were awesome! The movie was so well done, I'd have to say that it is the best movie in the series so far!

The best by far,"I must say I am extremely sick of this movie, though not for conventional reasons. Nine reels is a lot to put together and screening a three hour movie can be exhausting, especially when you're trying to write several term papers during the same week it is coming out. You see, I am a projectionist and getting this movie ready for a midnight show was part of my job. I realize that the fact that I was paid $14.50/hr to watch this movie on Wednesday night might give rise to feelings of jealousy among some, but I am currently wishing I could manage to get more than five hours of sleep sometime soon.All that said I must say this was by far the greatest Harry Potter film so far. Although it was long, it did not drag on. It had a nice, tight feel to it. It progressed from scene to scene with a smoothness that I find to be lacking in many movies adapted from books. The acting has noticeably improved from the first three, and the more adult feel to this one really drew me in. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this movie was the fact that it felt like a mix of genres. It had an epic feel to it. After all it is about good v. evil and battling the dark wizards, etc. This movie,however, also felt like a high school movie. It had the issues of coming of age, which makes sense as the characters begin to mature. Ultimately it came off a lot more loyal to the book in theme than I think the last one did. (The first two, while loyal, I found to be relatively campy and childish.)This movie, like many, does have its shortfalls. I believe that Dumbledore was portrayed as a little too intense, like an old Al Pacino. Instead of the benevolent, kind, and good-humored old man I have always loved in the books. As someone that has read the books, I must say another shortfall is that this movie banks on familiarity with the story. Having read the books, I found it very easy to follow, but I could understand how one who has not read the books may feel a bit lost, as some important information was left out and some back-story was left mostly unexplained.All in all I would say this is definitely the best movie in this series so far, and if the next three are on par with this one then I would be content.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
can't get much better,"I just saw the movie for the first time and i was very surprised on how good the movie relates to the book. this was my favorite book as it was transitioning into a more serious and in-dept story. No offense to the other books before as they were great too, but this is the story were its not so childish and the characters are becoming more mature and serious about their futures. the movie does a great job on its special effects, acting, and all together the direction movie went. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat with all the action, suspense(the dragon scene were especially good), and drama.If your a fan of the books, then I highly suggest that you go see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"The Good, The Bad, The Ugly","I did enjoy this movie, but being a huge fan of the books, I was frustrated with a lot of the things that were touched upon, but not really followed though with.First things first, I give Mike Newell and Steve Kloves credit for finally giving Fred and George the screen time they deserve. I'm glad the movie audience finally got to see what truly great characters those two are.Daniel Radcliff and Rupert Grint (Ron saying ""Bloody Hell"" when Hermione woke him up at the beginning was hysterical) play the perfect awkward teenage boys as well. They had great comedic timing in delivering lines and tripping over themselves around girls.Cedric, Cho, Fleur, and Viktor were all perfectly cast, but had too few lines.Alan Rickman, as always was Brilliant as Snape. It was also great to see Professor McGonagall as a more fully developed character. Neville getting more screen time was good as well.Cedric's death and Voldemort's return was very powerful.As far as things that were in and things that were cut, I think that the things that made the film should have been finished on. Like the Quidditch cup, the Stadium and campground were really cool, but why show all that then skip the match. I felt like the filmmakers were shaking a pop can and when they opened it, there was a mere hissing noise.Why put Rita Skeeter in at all if they aren't even going to reveal that she is an animagus? That's important in book five. That would have been a much better way to end the movie than Hermione saying things are going to be different now aren't they? Gee Voldy's back, Captain obvious to the rescue! Oh and Ron's reaction to Fleur kissing him was great, but where was Hermione's jealousy. They put in the post Yule Ball argument, so why not enhance it? It would have taken two seconds to show Hermione's jealousy, and it would have been funny.The wands connecting was important, but the Phoenix song was never explained, and are people who have only seen the movies going to remember the wand core thing from the first movie? And Hermione is a character I feel the filmmakers have not properly interpreted. I mean the Yule ball scene bugged the crap out of me the way she came down with that smug look on her face! Ugh! I liked Hermione better in the book when she was smiling sheepishly, she was just more endearing that way. And her dress and hair made her look more like a five year old playing dress up, as opposed to a blossoming teenager. They should have followed JKR's description when designing the costume. Periwinkle would have been more flattering than pink, IMO.I'm glad Ginny got a wee bit of face time here, but she'd better not get the shaft in the OotP movie, if they give Hermione her lines there, I will be POed.Anyway I did enjoy this movie overall, but being a huge fan of the book, I couldn't help but nitpick, LOL",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Great Movie,This is a awesome Harry Potter Movie It is really pretty well done with a dark and spooky feel It almost made me wet my pants and I'm 28 years old. Yeah there is some stuff left out that was in the book but there is plenty of action and effects. Its a must see for all fans of the books and movies. This movie is the best of the series to date. I can't wait for the DVD to find out if there's anything added that was left out of the film. This movie is best on the big screen. The young actors are growing up well. I'm afraid that pretty soon they will be too old for there roles in the film. I know some people probably won't like this film too much and its not for the really young kids but Its a great film and I would not miss it for the world.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
*A Tapestry of Shadows and Triumph*,"With ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"" the series takes a breathtaking leap into a darker, more complex realm where youthful exuberance collides with the stark realities of growing up. This film, directed by Mike Newell, is not merely an adaptation of J. K. Rowling's beloved novel but a multifaceted exploration of courage, friendship, and the inevitable confrontation with destiny.From its very first moments, the film envelops viewers in a whirlwind of excitement as it introduces the Quidditch World Cup-a dazzling spectacle of sport that immediately captures our imaginations. The vibrant colors and booming sounds transport us into the heart of a thrilling magical event, setting the stage for the gravity of what is to come. Yet, beneath the jubilant celebration lies a palpable tension, a harbinger of the challenges that await our heroes.As Harry steps into the Triwizard Tournament, the film brilliantly showcases the maturation of its characters. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint deliver performances that resonate with authenticity, portraying not just the innocence of youth, but the burdens of responsibility that weigh heavily on their shoulders. Harry's journey in this film mirrors the tumultuous passage from adolescence to adulthood, infused with moments of laughter, despair, and ultimate resolve.""Goblet of Fire"" is a feast for the eyes. The cinematography captures the grandeur of Hogwarts and the surrounding landscapes, while also delving into the darker corners of the wizarding world, marked by the haunting return of Voldemort. The film's score, composed by Patrick Doyle, elevates every scene, echoing the emotional turmoil faced by the characters and enhancing the sense of urgency that permeates the narrative.What sets this installment apart is its exploration of the complexities of friendship and rivalry. The introduction of new characters like Cedric Diggory (played by Robert Pattinson) and Fleur Delacour (portrayed by Clémence Poésy) adds layers to the story, intertwining Harry's fate with the stark realities of competition and camaraderie. The poignant moments shared between Harry and his friends remind us of the bonds that forge our identities, even in times of trial.The film culminates in an unforgettable climax that challenges everything we thought we knew about good and evil. The stunning revelation of Voldemort's return catapults us into a realm of uncertainty, leaving viewers not only awash in tension but also yearning for more. It's a powerful reminder that the battle against darkness is not just fought with magic but with the strength of our choices and friendships.""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" is a masterfully crafted film that transcends its predecessors by embracing the complexity of its characters and the weight of its themes. It serves as a dazzling tapestry woven from threads of adventure, heartache, and ultimately, hope. As we immerse ourselves in the magical yet daunting world of Harry Potter, we are left not just as spectators, but as participants in a profound journey of growth and resilience. This is not just a film for fans but a cinematic experience that resonates with anyone who has ever dared to dream and face their fears.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Rowling's Roller-coaster Gathers Pace,"First, a confession: I am not, by any stretch of the imagination, a Potter fan, so I felt something of a fraud as I sneaked into a media screening of Goblet of Fire while many bona fide devotees have had to wait it out.My interest in the franchise has thus far consisted of sitting through the first film in a freezing cinema wondering what all the fuss was about, and skim-reading the second book on an aeroplane to appease my curiosity as to the young wizard's appeal. I have long been astonished at the sheer scale of Rowling's achievement, and while I may treat many of my fellow commuters - the regressive thirty-somethings who are buried in her CHILDREN'S novels on the tube  with something approaching contempt, I realise her success is very much deserved. It's a bit excessive though, and frankly enough to reduce any impoverished wannabe writer to a jealous whimper.Being an outsider who will undoubtedly get all the names wrong, I won't spend long here on the plot, save to say it revolves around the ""tri-wizard tournament""  an epic and dangerous event that threatens to split Hogwarts loyalties asunder.Instead, I'll concentrate on the performances, and, first up, I fear I must say I have reservations over the casting of Harry. Daniel Radcliffe looked an inspired choice after the first film  floppy hair and specs and an earnest charm - but I'm afraid to say, he is an ordinary actor. The trouble with hiring an eleven year old for a film project as massive as this, is you are rather in the lap of the gods when it comes to puberty. It's a bit like doting on a baby puppy and then being terribly upset a year or so later when a bloody great Alsatian smashes up your living room and defecates on your carpet.Much better are his faithful chums. Rubber-faced Ron (Rupert Grint) handles the adolescent grunting with considerably more aplomb than Radcliffe, and he also says ""bloody hell"" a lot which elicited gasps of delight from some of the younger viewers around me. There is some nice chemistry between him and the hitherto gawky and posh Hermione who has blossomed into a snooty English rose, and the theme of teenage angst runs deep throughout the excellent supporting cast.""Dark and difficult times lie ahead"" is the smartly worded tagline, and one gets the impression Harry is far more comfortable dodging fire-breathing dragons, than he is tiptoeing around the opposite sex. The growing pains are neatly handled by director Mike Newell, himself no stranger to the awkward whimsy of love's young dream after sterling work on Four Weddings and a Funeral  Indeed, many of the light-hearted interludes around the school dance scenes betray Newell's penchant for bittersweet comedy and romantic pratfalls.And, of course, the adults in the cast zoom around with a zest inspired by their youthful co-stars. Robbie Coltrane's Hagrid fashions an unlikely romance with a giantess played by Frances De La Tour; Michael Gambon is a sprightly Dumbledore; and Gary Oldman's screen time is restricted to one scene where he thrusts his head through the burning coals of a roaring fire to offer Harry some sage advice. Perhaps they should have simply hired a stunt double and saved on his fee.Most impressive of all is Ralph Fiennes who is genuinely terrifying as the evil Lord Voldemort. Fiennes is ably assisted in his wickedness by a suitably conniving Timothy Spall and also the most fearsome set of nostrils to grace the silver screen since Hannibal Lector flexed his snout at Agent Starling in The Silence of the Lambs.It is pretty stirring stuff  visually extraordinary in places  and nicely paced. Potterfiles will love it and detractors may just find their criticisms stuck in their throats. However, my disdain for adults who proudly devour the novels on public transport without any sense of shame remains absolute.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Best Of The Harry Potter Movies By Far!!!!!,"I had the privilege of seeing the newest addition to the Harry Potter movies last night. I must say it was an awesome movie. Definitely the best of the Harry Potter movies so far.ACTING: In general the movie had very good acting. The trio gave us excellent performances. The adult actors were good too.SPECIAL EFFECTS: One word. Awesome!! Absolutely incredible special effects. They've gotta be one of the best special effects I have seen in a movie since The Lord of the Rings trilogy.DIRECTION: The director Mike Newell, in my opinion did an excellent job at directing this film. Right now he is god to me. Good job Mike and good luck in the future. Keep up the amazing work!!!!10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Four champions and a funeral,"So this is the new, long awaited Harry Potter, the adaptation of the fourth part of the legendary magical book series. I've been waiting for this movie for, let's say a year now. And from what I've heard, seen in the trailer and the MTV Making of I was optimistic. Even more so because Mike Newell directed the film who also did one of my favourite films, ""Four weddings and a funeral"". And yes, I had high expectations.The beginning is spectacular. I didn't mind that they left the Dursleys out  we had the Weasleys rescuing Harry from his summer holiday jail in the second Harry Potter film already. Then the film directly dives into the Quidditch finals and all the scary events surrounding it. Now, I thought, now we'll see the spectacular game! But would you believe it, after some impressions of the audience and a spectacular appearance of the two teams, the Irish and the Bulgarian, we are already taken away from the game. And so on, and so on. This is basically how the whole film goes: The director throws us into a situation and after some minutes takes us out of it without letting us time to understand or let it work. Don't get me wrong, the film has its moments. And Mike Newell shows that he has a good sense of humour. But Harry Potter is not a slapstick-comedy and we don't need a laughter every two seconds.The fourth Harry Potter book has so many interesting moments and potential  the stunning Quidditch World Championship final, the dangerous tasks at the Triwizard Tournament and its tragic ending, the romantic moments at the Yule Ball. Those were the scenes I was most looking for and Mike Newell spoiled ALL of them. Where is the wonderful scene in the garden that takes place after the Yule Ball? Where are all (or at least some) of the great obstacles that Harry has to face in the maze when it comes to the final showdown between him and Cedric in the tournament?In my opinion the best two adaptations of Harry Potter are still the first two films under the direction of Chris Columbus. Some say those films are way too kitschy, but they had something you love in the books but never find in the third and fourth film: A heart, a soul and  most of all  magic. Mike Newell himself said that the fourth book is a thriller. Yes, it is. But it is also a fairy tale and about magic. We can't find neither of these two qualities in the film. ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" is nothing more than situations and impressions lined up after one another. Without emotion, without sense and without giving the viewer time to breath in between. So at some point you just lean back, switch your head off and watch the kids and adults work in their roles. But if this moment arrives during a film it's the worst thing this film can do. Besides, I don't want to criticize it just because I'm a fan of the books. I'm glad I read the book before seeing this film. Because if somebody sees this film without reading the book first he will get more questions than answers. For example  Harry's dream of the house, where he sees Voldemort, is never explained in the film. Yes, it is foreshadowing the ending but we all know that there is another link (and is explained in the book). If you don't know the link you ask yourself: Why the heck did he show this dream sequence? He might as well have left it out.A word about the cast Nothing to complain about the adults  they're gorgeous as usual. As for the trio  I really liked Daniel's performance  he's getting better with every film and this one was maybe his best so far. Rupert ""Ron"" Grint is the only one of the three who really goes through a change  he is no clown any more and not only a sidekick  he begins to question things (including his friendship to Harry) and to develop his own personality. Emma Watson  well, what shall I say? She's not a bad actress but thanks to the director she behaves like a hysteric little girl throughout the whole movie  which most of the time is absolutely unnecessary. In general I must say that the director really achieved making slapstick clowns of most of the cast. Hello, we're not in a Charlie Chaplin movie here! In my opinion the best performance of the film comes from a youngster that stayed in the background and was nothing but a laugh so far  Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom. He's basically the only teenager that could carry the character of the book to the screen and through the whole movie  he is a shy boy discovering the girls and maturing. His performance was really touching.. It's a good co-incidence and a good job by the young actor because in the next Harry Potter movie Neville Longbottom will play an important role. Nice performances also by the gorgeous and hunky Robert Pattinson as the tragic hero Cedric Diggory and the charming Katie Leung as Cho.All in one ""Harry Potter and the GoF"" is a 3-hour-trailer: Scenes and people are introduced without letting them space to develop their character, we get hints and foreshadowings, surprises and impressions but you cannot really see a flow or a plot. So for everyone who doesn't want to think, doesn't care about magic or good cinema, this is the right film. I do and this is why I was very disappointed.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Different Potter movie...,"I was lucky to have the opportunity to see this movie. I know that people are tired of hearing this, but is THE BEST POTTER FILM I've ever seen. OK, I'm a fan of Harry Potter, but not so much of their movies. I think that the three previous movies were OK, but it has a different style of the last one (the previous hadn't so much mysterious, well at least the first and the third). The music was OK (although Patrick Doyle used a lot of violins) and the Mcbeth sisters were excellent! Of my part I think that this is the best of Newell (Mona Lisa smile was boring!!!)and I hope him to direct another Potter movie. My rate is 10/10, i'm glad to say that it deserved it :).",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"The older Harry gets, the darker life becomes","Goblet of Fire is of course, well done and beautifully shot. Not having read any of the Potter series, I wasn't disappointed in the movie at all. From what I have heard, many underlying plots and characters may have been skipped to streamline the movie and keep its focus, so the readers might be disappointed, I don't know. ""Fire"" is darker than the rest of the movies. Seemed to lack some of the humor that gave the previous films some levity. Great storyline, fabulous effects. LONG though. It's about 2.5 hours long, so make time for it. It's worth it to watch and goes quickly. Throughly enjoyed it, but not my favorite of the bunch so far.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Review,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a film directed by Mike Newell. With every instalment of the series, my anticipation for the film also increased. And I can say even with the fourth instalment, the excitement is never reduced.Plot: Harry Potter is selected by the Goblet of fire to compete in the Triwizard Tournament making him the youngest ever to compete much to the chagrin of everyone.Story and direction: This is the first film in the series not to have the first scene at Privett Drive. I thought it was the right move considering the film has many things going on. During the first fifteen minutes or so, the film feels quite fast paced. I didn't get the understanding as to what his happening. If the makers would have given a little importance to the beginning, I guess the film would have worked wonders. But after those initial minutes, I was totally engrossed in the movie. There were some new characters to look out for and I can say all of them impressed. Also some of the VFX work in this film is incredible especially the broom scenes which have greatly improved. With that being said, I would add that the tournament scenes were well directed. There is always a sense of tension in the atmosphere during the scenes as you care for the safety of those characters. The film also brings another aspect of the trio's friendship into light which was very nicely handled. This is the first film also not to feature John Williams as score composer. But I can very well say that Patrick Doyle did a spectacular job as composer. The film do marks the very first appearance of Voldemort and I can say that he is terrifying. With his appearance and the build-up that has beenmade, you can say that this man means business and also that he is ruthless and would harm just anyone who comes his way.Performances: If I had to pin-point I had to say that this was by far Daniel Radcliffe's best as Harry Potter. The emotional side had never been explored until this film as it was great. As for new characters, Ralph Fiennes just nailed it as Voldemort. He just looks as the villain you predicted. Brendan Gleeson brings his charm to the screen and that just lights up the scene itself. Robert Pattinson also justifies his performance. Timothy Spall and David Tenant gave good support. As for rest of the cast, always just do justice to their roles and never have they given me a single reason to complain.Favorite Scene: It would be the Yule Ball scene where the boys after the initial dance just sit at one side and are jealous of Hermione seeing she is having a lot of fun unlike them. This very well depicts the teenagers who are at that age.Verdict; Thanks to Mike Newell and Steve Kloves we have got another griping chapter to the series. Except for the first fifteen minutes, I enjoyed the entire film.I am going with a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Best Harry Potter movie,"Having not thought much about the other HP movies, I went in to this one expecting the worst, and was pleasantly surprised.Don't get me wrong, I am a *massive* fan of the books, but Radcliffe & Co. haven't really done it for me so far.As long as you don't think too much about the book, as a stand-alone movie this is fine, quality family entertainment. There are some polished performances from the teenage stars, and the plot flows along nicely.Overall then, a good movie. Not one of the greatest ever made, but certainly the best Potter we've seen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
so good,i thought that the film was really good well worth my money i thought they did really well with all the things going off it was excellent. i also thought the actors and actresses were very well chosen and worked well with each other. I thought voldermort was very very good because nobody ever seen him before it must have been very hard to for-fill every ones expectations. I thought it was funny and it kept you wanting more. my favourite part was when they went into the maze and ' mad eye moody 'pointed the way he should go. Like i said before it is a lot a peoples favourite book and there was a lot a expectations for the cast and crew to fill and they did it beautiful. When it said you have to fill 10 lines i thought it would be really hard but it was very easy finding good things to say about the film i also enjoyed the bathtub sense.

"Have you ever heard the song ""Killing the thing that You Love""","OK, as a big fan, I had to see this movie asap. The first thing I was exited to see was what the Weasley twins did to Dudley, but nope, cut out. Then the whole world cup and the Veelas, nope, cut out. Then I thought, they'll have to get it right soon, ha, no flying muggles.Some thing that I noticed is that Dobby and Bagman were missing. Along with Dobby, SPEW/the house-elf liberation front was missing. Neville was able to dance, and the Cho-Harry-Cedric triangle was all thrown off. Everything, including Dumbledore's emotion, was thrown out of proportion.Before you judge, or go on, note that I do realize the effort and problems with a book this size.Anyway. Some of these things were taken out because they were needed to be: Crouch Junior attacked dear old papa, the little joke behind McGonagall putting her hair down, Moody's grand entrance, the mermaid picture helping, Skeeter's ""ability"", many obstacles on the third task, Harry and the Weasley's in a box with the ministers, and why Krum went all crazy on the third task.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Potter movies are going downhill...,"Both of us agreed, the Goblet of Fire was a soulless, mechanical, disappointment. The latest Potter movie has no humor, no wit, and substitutes frenetic action for plot and dialogue. The characters seem made of cardboard, being moved about by the director to advance the plot. There is none of the subtlety, or wit of the first movie. None of the character development and advancing friendship between the main characters of the second movie. As the Potter movies advance, they have steadily deteriorated. These movies now absolutely are not for children under 16 and are largely a waste of time. Special effects do not make the movie any more. We give the Goblet of Fire two thumbs down for sloppy script, lack of intelligence and substitution of mishmash for coherence.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Everything I could have expected,"I cannot count on one hand how many times I had read the book. I absolutely LOVE the book and I had very high expectations for the movie. I agonized with myself how in the heck were they going to slim it down to under 3 hours, but they did it. Like the last movie, I expected major plot aspects to be left out of this movie. I feel that Prisoner of Azkaban (POA) left to much important details out to focus on other things. Don't get me wrong though it was a good movie but don't get me started on what they should have included.Goblet of Fire (GOF) was everything I could have expected it to be, even more so! Granted...if we could have it our way...we could included absolutely everything from the book but then the movie would be 6 hours long. If you had to cut something for the sake of making a movie the crew of GOF did it appropriately.GOF was surprisingly upbeat though. I expected it to be darker (scarier) than POA in may ways. But I found myself laughing very often. Which seems like a great set-up for Order of the Phoenix as far as the Weasly twins are concerned. For those of you who know the books and have seen GOF than you know what I am talking about.GOF had great special effects and Mike Newell did a wonderful job directing the actors to appropriately portray their characters. It's a tough job and it couldn't have been done better. A huge 10 for me!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Decent but severely flawed,"""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" presents the fourth installment of the Harry Potter franchise, illustrating a significantly darker take on the characters we've come to love and allowing us to see the dark Lord Voldemort resurrected to his full power. Easily one of the better books of the entire series by JK Rowling (including books 5 and 6), the darker and scarier take on the story was welcomed by fans of the films and the books everywhere as Director Mike Newell (Donnie Brasco) attempts to attach his name to an ever-growing franchise. But, rest assured, this film has many flaws.For one, the acting remains a substantial problem that is bound to plague the fans for the remainder of the franchise, including the next few films that are already signed up. The big budget and the excellent special effects can't alleviate the responsibility that the three young actors have to presenting decent performances. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), despite improving immensely since the previous installment, remains stiff and uncharismatic on screen whereas Emma Watson's melodramatic take on the character of Hermione had the entire audience frustrated. She seems to be throwing herself into her role with too much gusto and enthusiasm, resulting in a pretentious and unsatisfying performance that remains a plague on the rest of the film's merits. Dumbledore is pathetic in his role, completely misunderstanding the direction of his character and ultimately illustrating Newell's lack of grasp of what Harry Potter is really all about. The only actor that seems to stand out in a positive light is indeed Rupert Grint (Ron) who takes his performance easily. From his flawless comic timing to his understanding of the more serious scenes as well, here is an actor we will no doubt see after the Harry Potter film franchise has concluded. He stands out as the more talented of the three teenagers.Newell's direction is furthermore extremely flawed, surprising after the brilliant and entertaining ""Donnie Brasco"". Not only does he fail to understand the needs and wants of the actors in their respective performances, but he seems to also clutch no grasp of what made this book so amazing. Gone now is the magic of Chris Columbus in the first and second installments of the franchise, and supposedly Newell was to present a darker take on our heroes. He does so, but at what expense? Whereas the book by all means illustrated a darker take, it did so through a compromise with the more magical and ""Christmassy"" elements of the first few Harry Potter books as well as the scarier elements. Newell completely abandons the magic of the first few films and goes for an all out ""noir"", losing one of the best bits about a Harry Potter film: magic.The script remains tarred, leaving out some of the best and most entertaining elements of the novel such as the opening Quidditch World Cup - an exhilarating read and surely an excellent addition to the film? Once again, the elements that made the book so magical are completely left out in the script and are failed to be remedied by Newell's poor direction. The script's inability to identify emotions and character is further exemplified through the completely underdeveloped problem of Ron's jealousy of Harry, as well as the seemingly over-developed problem of Ron and Hermione's increasingly changing relationship. Where the book merely hints at such a concept, the script-writer deems it at the forefront and shows a half-assed attempt at a romantic comedy within a few weak scenes. It doesn't help when Emma Watson takes it seriously, either.That being said, the special effects are relatively good throughout the three tasks that our Tri-Wizard champions must face - ranging from the amazing sequence of Harry dodging left and right to avoid the Hungarian Horntail Dragon hot on his heels, to the murky depths of the school lake as Harry explores the underworld of the blue. The cinematography of the film is fairly decent also, but by no means a notch above the previous three films. Other technical aspects such as the score and the editing are relatively impressive but again pose no substantial superiority over the previous three films.To sum up the film ... Different; yes. Better; not necessarily. A darker take definitely, Newell forgets to show the real magic behind the Harry Potter franchise. Poor acting for major characters, a patchy and inconsistent script that seemingly misinterprets the brilliance of Rowling's fourth novel, and Newell's inability to direct both the action and the actors on screen result in a film that is mediocre at best and completely undeserving of the recent hype that has accompanied its theatrical release.All we can hope for is that the next film brings back the magic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the best films I've seen in years!,"Unlike it's predecessors this film starts off running and doesn't stop. I love the others but I must admit I was amazed how good this one really was. Although the fourth book is my favourite I was worried that it would lack something in the transfer to film. I was wrong! The new kids are great as are Emma and Rupert. Daniel Radcliffe is good but very similar to the last film. He's a good actor but I don't think he is strong enough to lead the franchise. Ironically the real leads are the outstanding supporting characters, such as Alan Rickman's Snape and especially Maggie Smith's McGonagall. Michael Gambon is good but I'm still thinking of Richard Harris when I read the books. Brendan Gleeson as Mad-Eye Moody is amazing as is Ralph Fiennes as V.... He Who Must Not Be Named!

"Good Graphics, Bad Content","Last night I went to go and see the midnight showing of the latest installment of the Harry Potter film series. I must say the graphics and special effects were most impressive, and the details were magnificent. But this movie does NOT do the book justice, anyone who is a true fan of the books could tell you that. The sheer volume of information that was left out of this movie almost made me sick. They cut out several highly important characters from the book, such as Winky the house-elf, Ludo Bagman, The Dursleys, and Molly and Percy Weasly, but yet they had time to add in nonsense scenes that never occurred in the book. One of the greatest blows was that they did not even show the quidditch world cup being played! The merely introduced it and then switched the next scene. The rapid switching of the scenes was to become commonplace throughout the movie, and I feel that if I was not already overly familiar with he books that I would not be able to understand it. If the studio would have made it into two movies and not tried to cram the 600+ page book, it would have been one of the most stunning movies of this year. but as it stands, it is a disappointment to the book, and to Harry Potter fans everywhere.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Fun, even from an outsider's point of view","The only experience I have had with Harry Potter is the first film. My spouse reads the books fanatically and sporadically sees the films.

Like the first, it was well made, intelligent, and visually interesting. Nevertheless, don't expect to get it all if you haven't kept up with the books, and if you have, don't expect to be given it all. Movies can not be as rich as books - especially lengthy and well written ones.This film finds Harry experiencing frightening dreams and mysteriously enrolled in a deadly wizard's tournament which he is too young to be part of, mentored by a new professor with unusual teaching methods, and experiencing serious growing pains. His friends Hermione and Ron are also back, and so are his usual teachers, and they are all just as likable as ever.

Film missing Cuaron's creativity,"I found ""Goblet of Fire"" to be good, but rather cryptic for those who've never read the book. I noticed that, to make up for time, it had multiple things happening in each scene, which made it feel like I was reading the book in fast forward. I cracked up at the scene when Ron puts on his ""dress robe"" and Ralph Fiennes did an awesome job -- they couldn't have found anyone better. While staying mostly true to the plot lines of the book, this movie (and perhaps the book as well) exchanged some of its magical awe for more grown-up ""teen angst"" conflicts between the characters. I missed the cool quirky beautiful style that Alfonso Cuaron brought to the series (think the talking head in the Knight Bus and Harry's surprise flight on Buckbeak), but Mike Newell got the job done nicely.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Many Harry Potter fans have shown anger and disappointment towards Warner Brothers for not making the movies like the books. They don't realize that that would be almost impossible. Though many of us raving fans would love a 4 hour long movie, the general public would not, therefore resulting in the movies not making nearly as much money as they do now.Film makers will try their best to capture the essence and mood of the story with the imaginations they are given.Books will be books.

The Best Potter of the First Four!,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the best Harry Potter film of the first four. The tone is darker, the acting is better, and so much more. There is only a small minimal problem that is no surprise. This time around, Harry enters his fourth year at Hogwarts. His name got entered into the Triwizard Tournament and he must compete. Little did he know that the tournament will lead to eventual trouble with a wizard who been gone for thirteen years. The acting is better in this film. Radcliffe is more appealing as Harry. Watson overacts a bit too much, but she did OK. The supporting actors like Gambon and Rickman are fantastic. I also liked the music in this film. It has a nice sound to it. The only problem is that some subplots were left out. I wished to see the Dursley's, Dobby and Winky, Charlie and Bill, the visits to Hogsmeade and Sirius, and the midnight argument with Moddy and Snape. Other than that, this film is sooooo much better than any of the other films. If I could, I would rate this film a 15/10, but I rate it a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Snap, crackle, fizzle.","Like James Bond without Q or M, how can you have a Harry Potter film without the Dursley's? They were probably cut because they were not ""essential"" to the story and because this book was the longest of the 4 that have made it to the silver screen.But in losing the Dursley's, the movie seems to have lost its way a bit. Since time was limited, I would argue that side plots should have been cut more. The Ball and teenage angst was cute, but took far too long.In previous installments, the emotional power that drove the film was the extreme loss felt by Harry due to the death of his parents at the hands of Voldemort and how he is a child between two worlds.The movie should have expanded on the emotional aspects of the film and it should have stayed focused on advancing the key elements in the plot (the rising of Voldemort and the way the wizarding community responded to it).This would have given the movie greater continuity and allowed the director to have fewer loose ends.In the past, as with this story, I have not read the Harry Potter books until after the movie -- simply because I didn't want to spoil the movie. After seeing the movie, I read the book. This was the first time in the Potter series that reading the book was essential to understanding the movie. That should not happen.Indeed there was much from the book that needed to be cut to make a manageable movie. It seems a lot of ideas from the book were introduced halfway, then dropped. These holes in the storyline were very distracting when I was watching the movie.I would argue that less emphasis was placed on the teen angst, and that time directed toward advancing the elements that lead to the next story.While the movie had spectacular special effects, it lacked the emotional content of the previous works.It was still an enjoyable movie, but as far as the series goes... it was by far the weakest of the lot.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Best Harry Potter Film Yet,"This is without a doubt the best Harry Potter film yet! There were many funny moments and the special effects were excellent.

Also many of the background stories/information were left out and a person who has not read the book may be left confused. I do understand that it is not possible to fit everything into two and a half hours but certain information are important for the remaining books.

So disappointed,"I have seen all of the other movies and read the books numerous times and I am so disappointed with Warner Bros. I don't understand why they couldn't stick to the writing that J.K. did. They changed so much of the story so if you are looking for the books you will most likely want to walk out. Besides that the movie was extremely rushed jumping from scene to scene with no continuity. If you aren't going to do it right what is the point in even trying. The first two tasks are at least sort of like the book, but the third was the stupidest thing I have ever seen. It looked like the maze was just trying to eat them all. They left out the importance of the unforgivable curses and are turning the point of the movies to love stories. The love stories are supposed to be played down in the series cause they give nothing to the overall point of the story. The graveyard scene was the only part of the movie worth watching.The acting in the series is still great and was the only reason I didn't leave. Moody was portrayed well except for the eye which is supposed to be part of his head. Dumbledore was much to overzealous(I wish we still had the original). He isn't supposed to show fear yet. I just was overall disappointed with the movie and wish they would just stick to what J.K. writes.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Satisfying Blockbuster Film,"As a blockbuster - Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire satisfies as an appropriately darker, energetic, visually pleasing and action-packed fourth entry in the iconic franchise.

But the acting from the cast is reliably strong, the score is great, the world building is excellent and all the emotional scenes hit.

the moments of human spirit,"However, I cannot forgive the movie for neglecting the emotional care for other characters. Of course, please rest assured that I will not talk about the Malfoy father and son here, but rather characters who are more qualified and qualified to receive care than them, such as the Crouch father and son, Qiu, Krum and Furong, and Professor Snape. Except for the touching father son confrontation before the death of Old Crouch, these people are basically all reduced to black and white backgrounds. I really know that the pursuit of a perfect image of supporting role is like asking Draco to perform ""Fall Like an Angel"" in the Goblet of Fire. But sometimes one or two seconds of concentration can make the artistic conception suddenly high. At this moment, I miss Alfonso's ""prisoner"". Although I don't think he was as successful in character design as Newell, he was able to capture the moment of human nature with a brief lens, thus creating a realm of human nature. I particularly like the scene where Lupin reminisces about Lily for Harry in the air corridor, beautiful and sad, highlighting the vicissitudes of the werewolf experience and the heartbreaking life of his own generation; Then, for the first time, Sirius saw Hogwarts Castle under the moon. In such a dangerous moment, he could stop with Harry and marvel at the beauty of his alma mater under the melodious music. Even if it was only a few seconds, it instantly enhanced the humanistic care flavor of the film, meaning a long and profound realm. In the Goblet of Fire, even the easy to play scenes of Crouch's father and son's hidden secrets and Old Diggory's loss of his beloved son are ignored in the film's rigid and rough progression. In addition, there is no haughty and arrogant hibiscus, as well as all the moments of human spirit that need to be discovered in the original work.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
I still feel there is too much missing in this film and I did not read the book.,"In 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' the gang has returned to Hogwarts for yet another school year. This year is special, for Hogwarts is to host the TriWizard tournament. Contestants from rival schools (Beauxbatons Academy and the Durmstrang Institute) have come to participate. This is a very dangerous competition, so dangerous that only one upperclassman from each school can compete. However, when Harry Potter's name is selected as a fourth contestant, the involvement of the evil Voldemort is suspect.This is the fourth installment of J.K. Rowling's series of Harry Potter books. I did like this much better than the last film 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban', but I still think the first two were better. On it own merits, there is very little character development if any in this movie. You do not really learn much about the new characters that are introduced. Plus you can see several areas where there holes in the plot. I feel these books are getting just too big to cram into one movie. This book should have been made in to two films. It is two and a half hours long, but the time goes by really fast.I think the director (Mike Newell) did a better job bring the look and feel of Hogwarts than the director (Alfonso Cuarón) of the last.

The very best yet!,"As a massive fan of both books and movies, each in their own right, it seems that I personally have an easier time with the Harry Potter adaptations than other viewers. I went into this installment knowing that certain things had been cut and anticipating that still more things would be. I also went with an understanding that first and foremost this story is about *Harry*--anything that doesn't directly propel his storyline is fair game to find itself on the cutting room floor.That being said, I think Goblet of Fire is truly the most remarkable of the Harry Potter films to date. The imagery is beautiful and intense, and the acting is greatly improved, especially by Daniel Radcliffe who has certainly grown in his comfort level on screen and pulls off his emotional scenes flawlessly this time around. I was also pleased with Michael Gambon's job as Headmaster Albus Dumbledore. I loved Richard Harris, and I believe that had he lived on he would have continued to be the perfect Dumbledore, but what the naysayers must keep in mind is that Dumbledore is not only a kindly, chuckling old man, he is also fierce and powerful and, regrettably, fallible--something which I think Gambon is embracing more fully in his own portrayal. He needs only to add back that element of Harris-like nobility and quiet charm, and his Dumbledore could very well be spot on.Now, being such a fan of JK Rowling's books, I understand completely where others come from when they complain about the little changes, but what confuses me is that when I walked out of the theater at 2:30am on November 18th, I was thinking to myself that GOF had been *very* booky in fact, and an excellent movie besides! For me, the prior knowledge of the book just fills in the gaps for whatever was cut in the film and enriches the experience.I think the negative viewers sometimes narrow their gaze too completely on what was left out and subsequently overlook the little details, straight from the book, that were left in. For instance: Fred asking Angelina to the Yule Ball; the ""Potter Stinks"" buttons; Madame Maxime's flying horses only drinking ""single malt whiskey""; Moaning Myrtle's talk of disappearing bubbles. It's things like that, I think, that make it very clear that the movie makers really DO care about the books and those of us fans who read them. The fact that Dobby wasn't included to serve a purpose easily served in other ways frankly doesn't bother me at all.My only issue with this film is that it will undoubtedly be much more difficult to understand for those audiences who haven't read the book. However, those that *have* been fortunate enough to have read Rowling's masterpiece should go to see this movie and try to keep an open mind about it. All the best scenes are there, don't worry.

short film from a long book,"Concise edited highlights, although what was kept in was done very well. Although the film is two and a half hours, there are some very abrupt cuts from one scene to another, and a lot is out of sequence. That said, there are some scenes which are directly from the book, while others are similar but missing a key point - when the boys are oggling the Beauxbaton girls, Hermione has a good retort - ""if you too would like to put yours eyes back in"" instead we just get a shot of her looking annoyed. One or two changes which I liked were the dance lessons, and the rebirth of Voldemort. Some of the things I disliked were very obvious mistakes, like Voldemort having normal eyes, the cup being made of crystal instead of silver, Amos having no beard, a lot of missing characters, wormtail cutting off his hand with no reaction, he should be writhing on the ground in pain and so on. I dislike changes being made to the story for no apparent reason. There is very little in the books that would not work on screen, and having read Steve Kloves scripts for the first three films I think he did a very good job. Pity we did not see his script on screen. I still think each book should be done as a mini series to cover all the details and bring to life jo's wonderful dialogue.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Disappointing.,"How unfortunate that ye-ol-movie-factory could not wait for Alfonso Cuarón to complete Azkaban so that he could direct this film. Rather they gave it over to Sappy-Four-Weddings-and-a-Funeral Mike Newell.Although Cuarón changed some of the story from Azkaban overall he made a film not only true to the tone and main plot of the book, but also a beautiful picture. He provided a level of artfulness to the Harry Potter films that had been missing and unfortunately it appears it has gone missing again.Goblet of Fire seems to be more concerned with winking at the audience when each ""cool"" thing from the book is included rather than actually showing a true story or tone of the book. How unfortunate that this film, even at 2 hrs 30 min, feels rushed and appears to missed the point.As a big Harry Potter fan this movie makes me feel more like re-reading the books than watching the films.If you are a fan you will find yourself smiling and maybe even cheering in the movie theater but end up going home feeling disappointed and empty. If you have not yet read the book, go check it out from the library and read it cover to cover before you go to the theater because the cliff notes version Mike Newell released today is far from complete or satisfying.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

The books are getting darker and so the movies naturally should follow suit. The main part of the Goblet of Fire is the Triwizard Tournament and most of the movie was concentrated on this. They skipped quickly through the beginning of the book so they could spend more time on what was most important. The scenes with the tasks were great, very dark, very gripping.

Goblet of Fire,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is hands down the most fun and entertaining movie of the series in between the beginning and end.

You also see brand new characters introduced who only continue to improve and shape the series. Finally, I loved that it continued to intensify and evolve the series story line to make it much more dark and sinister. It's no longer just a kids series, rather one for any type of audience. Absolutely fun and great movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Unmagical,"The bottom line is that the first two films engaged us on the sheer visual invention of the magical world. The third film was a good film as a film, architectural, Sculpted rhythm that matched the physical spaces shown.This one fails on both accounts. Oh, you will read that it attempts too much, coming of age meets thriller and so on. But I think it was simply a matter of not having a creative team in place that cared to make a good movie.There was only one cool effect: the seven Pegasii. And there was only one interesting character, Moaning Myrtle. Just one.So on the superficial level, the comment is that the basic film-making skills were absent.But wait! This is the guy behind ""Pushing Tin"" and ""Enchanted April,"" both supremely well done.So it must have been the producers that made this bloodless, a walk through the required scenes.So very strange, because the last one was all about rich film-making, It had a center, following the Orson Welles tradition that anchored the thing in the buildings. Why goof with expertise?Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Probably the last movie in the series to give a cool new variation.,Perhaps the best book so therefore possibly only one of 2 movies in the series (the other being Stone) to not actually improve on the book.It's fun though. The dark brooding tone feels more justified and there's a lot more of a plot to hang things on than the previous film.Things seem pretty rushed of course but you soon acclimatize. It helps to just let go of some of the scenes from the book you hoped to see realized.It gets very high-school drama complete with Christmas prom and he-likes-her-who-likes-him-who-likes-her vibe but I actually think that balances out the attempt at a gothic tone very nicely.,8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Weakest of the Harry Potter movies,"This is definitely a good movie but certainly not a great one. It does not compare well with the other Harry Potter movies. This one is big on special effects and action and although it touches on the characters' emotional issues it never addresses any of those issues in depth. This is unfortunately a typical Hollywood blockbuster type of movie that lacks the charm of the prior Harry Potter movies. There is no uplifting feeling to any aspect of this movie. When it's over, it's simply over. Certainly Azkaban was not as charming as the first two, but Azkaban replaced that charm with a definite edge. Goblet lacks that edge. Since the cast was excellent, with the exception of Michael Gambon who continues his lethargic portrayal of Dumbeldore, the blame must fall squarely at the feet of new series director Mike Newell. I can only hope that the DVD fleshes out some of the many themes from the book that were abandoned by the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"A darker, more suspenseful Harry Potter...","I won't give away a single plot line (if you really want to know - read the book) but I was much happier with this film then the last. Maybe I just don't like Alfonso Cuaron's style, but this movie had you mistrusting everyone. The Prisoner of Azkhaban seemed so frivolous next to this Mike Newell version of HP4.Goblet of Fire asks as many new questions as it answered the old ones. I loved the new characters they introduced and Brendan Gleeson's Mad-Eye Moody was amazing. Much less involved was Hagrid and Snape but we all know they factor more in the upcoming story lines.Two thumbs up - and DON'T wait until this one comes out on DVD. The special effects have to be seen on the big screen. I believe Daniel Radcliff did all his own stunts in this one as well, which makes the underwater scene all the more impressive... and this was a very impressive film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Good, but not great.","Honestly?Coming from an avid reader of the books, this movie was not as fantastically wonderful as I'd really imagined it to be. Of course, I understand that time is of the essence and that cutting down on certain parts of the book is to be unavoidable. However, while leaving out some 'quite-important-but-okay-not-to-have' parts, the movie concentrated on some very unimportant, insignificantly retarded parts. Parts that have been added in by the screenwriter and weren't even in the book to begin with.And I'm thoroughly disappointed with the casting of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. Richard Harris was a FABULOUS Dumbledore, Michael Gambom pales in comparison next to him. In the movie, Dumbledore certainly doesn't ACT like the Dumbledore we all know and love in the books, and that really got on my nerves throughout the movie. Mad Eye Moody, I can forgive. But not Dumbledore, never. Also, they've wasted the talents of Stanislav Ivanski (Viktor Krum) and Clemence Poesy (Fleur Delacour), both the characters having less than 20 lines each.However, that having been said, Harry Potter And The Goblet of Fire does have its redeeming qualities. Certain scenes will make you laugh till tears roll down your cheeks, the Weasley Twins, having finally been given more airtime, will steal the movie away. Neville Longbottom grabs more airtime as well, and you'll find yourself endeared to this forgetful, cute fellow.The graphics are magnificent, and I was blown away by the sceneries and details they'd place in each scene.Though not up to the readers' standards, I say that this movie will still blow your mind away.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Finally!! The HP movie I have been waiting for.,"Finally!! The HP movie I have been waiting for.No, it's not perfect, and rather I'm rather thankful, because that means the next one has room to be even better. But Goblet of Fire is far and away the best movie of series.The movie is full of action and I was able to get totally into the suspense of it all, even though I have read the book several times and already knew everything that was going to happen.The kids are finally kids! Mike Newell added a touch that has been missing, but increasingly needed, and that was to show the students as actual people, joking around, having fun, fighting with watch other, etc. This realism adds so much not only to this movie, in terms of fun and real heart, but lets the audience get to know the students and care about them and their struggles.The ending is pretty much flawless- powerful, touching, and exactly as I had imagined it, while still remaining true to the aims of this film.On of my biggest reservations about this movie is Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore as a little too panicky for my taste. Dumbledore is supposed to be, at least seemingly, very calm and in control of situations that arise in GoF. He doesn't know exactly what's going on or why in the book, yet he is always with an air of wisdom and power, and this is the reason Harry trusts him so limitlessly and comes to rely on him completely to be able to take care of any matters that arise.Overall, this movie is not only the best Potter movie to date, but one of my favorite movies of the year. It's action-packed, funny, real, sometimes scary, moving, and above all, heartfelt. You won't be disappointed by this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Worst Yet,"I enjoyed the first three movies. I thought they were fairly good to the books. In my opinion, the first two were just good movies, while the third was amazing. Therefore, I had high expectations going into the movie based on my favorite book in the series- and I was completely disappointed.It felt like the director hadn't even read the book. Dumbledore was freaking out in this movie, which is completely contrary to everything that was in the books. The point of Dumbledore's character is that he is not only a great wizard, but the stabilizing force for the good side of the wizarding world. When everybody else is losing their minds, Dumbledore is calm. In this movie, he is almost angry. For instance, when Harry's name comes out of the goblet, Dumbledore pushes Harry against a wall and yells at him, whereas in the book, he merely asks him kindly. In the book, Dumbledore trusts Harry and is frightened for him that he is in the tournament. In the movie, it seems like he has the same opinion of Harry as everyone else.Likewise with the character of Moody. In the books, Moody is a crazy old man who was a great auror. He is crazy, but crazy because he is suspicious of everything and will hex anything that moves. In the movie, he seems like a mental patient with a crazy gleam in his eyes. He seems to have no control over himself. Moody was my favorite character in the book, but while watching the movie, I just wanted him to get off screen because he was so much different from the books.I am not criticizing the actors in this movie. The acting was in my opinion, quite good. However, I blame the problems on the director. He completely changed the personality of Dumbledore, even from the previous movies. Likewise, the movie felt very rushed. They considered making this into two movies, and it was a bad decision not to. Most of the book was left out, which will I'm sure anger more than just myself. The three tasks took up the majority of the movie, and far too many scenes were combined to satisfy me.That isn't to say that the whole movie was a waste. I thought some of the things that the director did were great. For instance, the Quidditch Cup was good (although they left out the actual match). Likewise, the young actors continue to improve, and the veterans were solid as usual. Alan Rickman as Professor Snape needs to get more scenes because he steals every one the he is in.Overall, I thought that the movie was far too dramatic and overacted. I give it a 6. I can't say what I would have given it had I not read the books, because the movie was indeed well done. However, I can't justify ranking it higher because of my readings of the books.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Something Has Got to Give,"There is clearly a big problem with adapting an 800 page book as a 150 minute movie. In order to do this successfully a great deal of solid film-making craft is required. I don't believe either Steven Cloves or Mike Newell are even remotely capable of this sort of craft.Did the film cut too many things out, was that the problem? I don't think so. The problem seems to be that they tried to include as many of the little details from the book as they could and failed to ever do those details justice. For instance, what was the point of including the reporter? What did the scenes with the reporter add to the story? The plot point only established that Harry is an interesting character, which we already knew. The total dismissal of the reporter character throughout the rest of the story should be an indication of her importance. With a novel of this size the goal should be to capture the essential pieces of the story, to recreate whatever it is that makes the book interesting. I would have cast my vote for focusing on the experience of the three leads.The only thing that really disappointed me about the movie was the lack of depth of Harry, Ron, and Hermione.Whoever does the next film should do himself a favor and check out how L.A. Confidential was adapted, hopefully he'll learn something.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Fantastic adaptation and a fantastic movie.,"I had a great time watching this film. I'm always concerned that book-to-film adaptations will lose a lot of the finer points of the book, but that's not the case here. The writing team very nicely trimmed the fat of the book and even enhanced it as they realized there are six distinct acts of the narrative, and the rest is non-essential. The only noteworthy plot ""changes"" are that Barty Crouch Jr appears in the first scene, and the third task definitely changed (no cloud, skrewt, or sphinx). No house elves either, so anything that Dobby or Winky did was assigned to someone else. They also chopped a ton off the introduction (gimme more Mr. Weasley!) A couple other quick complaints: Hermione becomes a bit of a tramp (Ron, Harry, and her Ball date all seem to be getting some) and Dumbledore displays a violent temper (Richard Harris is sorely missed - Gambon's comments about Dumbledore show he's not in tune with the character). The lead-up to and the Yule Ball scene were hilarious - boys and girls are so dumb at age 14. The new cast additions are all great: Mad-Eye Moody is magnificent, Rita Skeeter is correctly abominable (but underused) and you can't help but have a huge crush on Cho Chang. The tournament tasks are appropriately breathtaking and the graveyard scene is equally creepy and exhilarating (what a surprise, Ralph Fiennes is great). I'm thrilled they got this one right; good luck making a movie of the 5th book.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Best So Far But no Longer Artistic,"This Movie is an Amazing movie and i recommend it for everyone. However it has had 3 movies in front of it who have made almost all of the design choices for it. the film future for the potter line is fairly well set in stone. The looks of the sets and costumes will not change in the future which stops this moving from fulfilling its artistic potential, but that is problematic of all book-movie conversations. What is left to be artistic is the directorial view (i.e. camera motions, filters, lighting levels, staging etc.) this film (as well as Prisoner of Azkaban) is darker than the rest, which sets it apart and gives it it's ""unqiue factor,"" that is the element that sets it apart from other films of the same type. most interesting to me is the study one can do in plot line. if you have not yet read the books and you are a artistic individual i would recommend you not read any more books till you have seen the movies of them. to many people this is an unconceivable thought but please listen to my logic. first off i have read the first 3 books and am reading the 4th now. every time you see one of these films there is always going to be someone there who read the book first and these individuals all sing the same chorus of ""they cut so much out!!"" this is true. However if you ask those who have only seen the movies they will say they understand the harry potter plot line. that is because while Rawlings books are very entertaining and have many many side stories and interesting facts about her wizard world, her book s are still largely ""fluff."" and that is why i made my recommendation. you can see these movies make coherent plot lines out of these books and not included every detail. looking in-depth at these changes after you have seen the movie makes both the book and the movie better in my opinion. this study in plot analysis will give you a more keen mind to what makes a story and what doesn't. i encourage everyone to try this, if you still can, and your movie going/book reading experiences will become much more enjoyable.For those who are curious, i suggest seeing the movies first then reading because obviously the books offer more information and when seeing the movie it can become more difficult to keep the two separate in your mind. if you start with the smaller and add to it things will stay more organized and you will be able to flush out Rawlings style, making the books more enjoyable. thanks you.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
GOBLET OF FIRE : They Keep Getting Better...,"HARRY POTTER & THE GOBLET OF FIREI have found these films to be enjoyable ever since THE SORCERER'S STONE, and yet I still continue to be surprised by how much they are able to continually strengthen the visual style, and tighten up the books in more appropriately cinematic ways with each passing film. GOBLET OF FIRE is superior to the earlier works and yet it still fits in very well with the preceding films.The film is a visual feast. The Quidditch match in the very beginning is beautifully portrayed, and Newell handles every elaborate sequence (virtually every round of the tournament, though especially the underwater segment in my eyes) with a confident, and selective eye.However, what was most incredible to me was the way that Newell managed to take something as simple as a boot (the turnkey) in the very beginning, and make it my favorite image in the movie. As the camera chases the Weasleys, Potter, and Hermoine up the hill rolling through the grass towards a beautiful sunset... only to finish the shot on a tattered shoe. It captures perfectly how magical Potter's world is, yet also how simple.The screenwriter deserves massive amounts of respect for condensing the book in a major way (and I loved the book when I read it 3 years ago)... however, he never loses the central theme of the novel or it's main narrative drive (having not read the book for a while and not remembering the specifics, I barely noticed anything missing b/c I was kept so involved). He also manages to balance out the dark/tragic elements in the end with the lighthearted innocence of children in school perfectly, never does one tone feel detrimental to the other.The adult performers always manage to do strong work with their small roles. I still view Watson, Grint, and Radcliffe as less then stellar actors... in every film I feel like I am watching them mimic EXACTLY what the director had to INSTRUCT them to do (I just don't feel like they really live and breath the characters, I always see a wheel turning). But, they look the parts, are enjoyable to watch, and I think they continue to slightly improve in each film.In the end though, this isn't a film that I go to in order to admire the performances. It is a popcorn flick, however one done with a lot of artistry. The plot developments are exciting, the characters are amusing, the imagery is beautiful, the action sequences thrilling, and the story engrossing.Highly entertaining... and the best POTTER film so far....

Goblet of Fire The Last Great Harry Film,"I have now seen each of the Harry Potter films once, and never read the books. I have no desire to ever read the books, and if I ever see the movies again it will only be because some woman makes me (or if I have kids, but presumably they will have new movies by then). I say this as a way to explain my review, because my opinion will be different from a fan of the books.The best film in the series so far is the third one. And judging the fifth one by the director, I do not think we're going to see any change on that status for a few years. But this is the fourth film (the second worst behind part two) so let us discuss this one.This is the story of Harry Potter and the Tri-Wizard Tournament. Harry and three other wizards (including a hot French chick and a Bulgarian built like a brick scat-house) must face three dangerous missions. The subplot is that Harry, Ron and Hermione are now entering puberty and adolescence and want to start dating people. Only Harry has no self-confidence and Ron comes off being more scared of women than anything else. Hermione easily finds a date, and the bewitching hour is soon upon us.The best part of this film was the introduction of Ralph Fiennes, who decided to play the role of Lord Voldemort rather than film ""Maid in Manhattan 2: Back in the Bronx"". Fiennes is a truly gifted actor, and he will bring some needed talent to the future pictures (with all due respect to the great Alan Rickman). I also enjoyed the special effects -- the creators of this film used them as much as possible without overdoing it. They assisted the plot rather than the plot assisting the effects. Too many films make this mistake, and I am glad this was not one of them.So why do I rank this the second worst of the first four? Because if I were to chart the climaxes of this film on a chart, it would look like a heart monitor of someone with a normal heartbeat: every so often a brief problem would arise and a quick solution was found. Nothing ever is given time to build up. And the end is worst of all -- rather than taking what should be the key moment to hype up the story, it just fades off into a happy cowboy-in-the-sunset scene. I was left completely unfulfilled and felt like the vast majority of this movie was filler between the third and fifth films, because almost none of the things in this movie will matter for the remainder of the series. But maybe you like to be unfulfilled, maybe you are a movie masochist.The fifth one comes across as even more of a bridge, though, making this one seem better in hindsight. And the inclusion of Robert Pattinson is sure to please a particular group of people, even if his role is not as major as it should have been (though at this point, who knew).",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Fantastic film, Straight out of the book!","I love the Harry Potter series, it's a very imaginative story that dose not dumb- down whatsoever. This becomes all the more true as the series goes on and Gobblet is a dark turning point in it. The film follows right along, recreating the images I saw in my mind as I read the book.One great thing about Gobblet is this is where the children begin to mature. This installment has a charming school dance, which brings to light a dual aspect in Harry Potter, he has faced countless deadly situations and came out alive, but is absolutely terrified of the prospects of romance. The dance is very cute and plays out in a realistic way.The dark climax of the film is very well done and satisfying. If you've read the book it will not disappoint, Newell held nothing back. If you haven't read the series then I think you will be surprised by the intensity of the climax. In either case see this film, it's fantastic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

director needs to go back to film school,"This movie really should of been a two part series. The movie is so choppy that if people hadn't of read the book they would not of known what the hell was going on. It was like they pulled out the best scenes, some one liners, and tried to work around the character relationships. I was glad to watch the movie, but very disappointed with what the directed and producers decided to do. The book is so massive now that the movie should of been two parts. Not only that, but the book was a major turning point in the series. The first three were mainly back story, but in the fourth, we find out a lot more about Harry and the other characters as they grow up. I also agree and wonder about why they let Dumblerdore lose it? He is always calm and it was very out of character to have him shake Harry. They really should of known better. I think many more people will be disappointed like me.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Strong special effects but story is lacking,"I felt quite a bit disappointed after seeing this movie and spent the whole car ride home arguing with my husband about the quality of the film. If you are looking for a lot of great special effects then this is the movie for you, if you actually read the books and are looking for the film to replicated the feel of the book then you will most likely be disappointed. It seemed to me that the director was to caught up with making the audience go ooh and ahhhh over the effects that he forgot about the story. I did like that Warner Bros. didn't try and P.G. rate this film because then it would have just been awful. Little Harry is not so little anymore and I was shocked at the number of children under age 6 in the theater, most of whom were completely uninterested or scared by the film. As a fan of the books first and the movies second, I must say that this has been the biggest Potter disappointment to date. I just hope that Warner Bros. finds a better director for the next film that will actually work in some type of underlying story to go with the special effects.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
harry potter 4,"In the 4th installment of J.K. Rowling's ""Harry Potter"" series, Mike Newell (""Four Weddings and a Funeral"") takes over as director for Alfonso Cuarόn. 10 minutes into the movie, at the Quidditch World Cup, it's obvious that Newell is aiming to make the movie scarier than the other three, when we see a group of guys in skeleton masks and hoods walking through camp lighting everything on fire. This is most likely what earned the movie its PG-13 rating.Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) wakes up from a dream of an old man who gets murdered by Wormtail, Voldermort's assistant. Harry wakes up, and he's at Ron Weasly's house. This is one part I don't like, because I enjoy the parts where Harry is at his aunt and uncle's house. Right away, he's at school. In the book, this is about 10 chapters long. As soon as he's at school, the other two schools, Beuxbatons and Durmstrang, arrive. Right after that, we hear about the Tri-wizard tournament, which, in the book, took much longer and was developed better.Most of the stuff I look forward to in the other movies, such as the House Sorting, and the Dursley's, and the banquet at the beginning of the year, were all left out, because the Tournament takes up most of the movie. One of the most popular characters, Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), is barely in this movie at all. Some characters new to the story are Fleur Delacour (Clemence Poesy), the representative in the tournament from Beuxbatons, Viktor Krum (Stanislav Ianevski) the representative from Durmstrang, and Professor ""Mad-Eye"" Moody (Brendan Gleeson), a new, extremely paranoid teacher. Also, Katie Leung plays Cho Chang, and Robert Pattinson as Cedric Diggory, the other Hogwarts champion.There are two problems with basing a movie on a book. One is, people who have the books memorized will be upset that the movie doesn't follow the book exactly. If it had, it would've been about 8 hours long. Already, at 2 hours and 37 minutes, it's much longer than average. The second problem is, if you read the book, then go see the movie, there's no surprise. You know what's going to happen, so you spend the time waiting for the end, and you don't enjoy the movie as much.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

This Cup runneth under.,"Note: I have read only the first four Harry Potter books. Take that as you will.Isn't this inevitable in any cinematic series? Maybe even more so given all of the behind-the-scenes changes between the Harry Potter films? Isn't one of the movies eventually doomed to fall short of its predecessor? Perhaps. Perhaps not. But ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" did.The story of ""Goblet"" takes a different turn, as the once-in-a-generation Tri-Wizard Tournament comes to Hogwarts, whose top students are joined by comrades from two other schools of magic in battling each other and colossal obstacles for the top prize. As the tournament progresses, Harry Potter endures issues with relationships and a mysterious pain emanating from the famous lightning bolt on his forehead. A very promising premise that ultimately shortarms its potential.The roots of ""Goblet""'s shortcomings lie in its predecessor, Alfonso Cuaron's ""Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban"". Had ""Goblet"" been released after Chris Columbus's two faithful but uninspired renditions, this movie would have been better. But Cuaron raised the bar for the screen translations with his breath-taking scene-setting and finely crafted shots. He infused the series with life by adding a dose of reality to Columbus's magical world. Newell wisely maintained the grounded portion of Cuaron's tone, but inexplicably drained it of Columbus's child-like wonder, while fading into typical technical film-making, feats that constantly leave the audience wanting more of everything.""Goblet"" is an epic book, a linchpin as the middle tome of seven. After You-Know-Who was absent in Azkaban, his presence returns here, turning the series in an entirely different direction. But despite the enormous themes of life, death, courage, and danger; despite the fact that Goblet contains more action than ""Azkaban""; despite scenes with Quidditch, dragons, and mermaids, nothing in the movie gets the blood pumping. Even a massive confrontation in the final act leaves one feeling short-shrifted, emotionally for those who know the story and informationally for those who have not. The same material produced a pulsing thread of underlying tension throughout the book, and the absence of that drama points to the way the movie was made. While Cuaron adroitly fashioned a soul for his movie and built everything around that hub, Newell and cinematographer Roger Pratt (""Chamber of Secrets""), who semi-successfully warms up the screen by emphasizing oranges and greens, seem to have ploddingly shot the movie on cruise control. By utilizing far too many close-ups and intercutting tight shots, and eliminating much of the enchanting background, the scope of the movie leans toward claustrophobic rather than expansive.The music doesn't help either. The fitful work of Patrick Doyle leaves one longing for the occasionally melodramatic John Williams, whose lingering themes are the only memorable part of the orchestrations. The veteran Doyle, who has a few quality scores to his credit (Henry V, Hamlet), seems determined to tell the viewer what to think and how to feel, as though composing from a How-to-write-a-movie-score book. The music intrudes at some key times, then suddenly vanishes at others, screaming PAY ATTENTION THIS IS IMPORTANT in its absence. Like the movie, Doyle's compositions never find a rhythm with the story.The pacing of that story doesn't aid the rhythm. Even though Goblet as a whole moves quickly, small portions less integral to the core story periodically stagnate the movie. Numerous new supporting characters require valuable time to be introduced; several decent but truncated scenes and characters (Quidditch World Cup, Rita Skeeter, etc.) should have been omitted altogether but were probably crammed in to appease fans; and the broad humor seems forced and out of place. The end result is an choppy episodic olio that deprives the movie of any rapid undertow that might whisk an eager audience into the story.All of these issues prove that a Harry Potter director should not be merely a guiding hand, but a creative force as well. Fortunately for Newell the source material for ""Goblet"", as in his Donnie Brasco, is so potent that even his workman-like turn doesn't cripple Rowling's towering tale. But his restraining hand lowers the level of exhilaration, the difference between admiring the Grand Canyon from on high and hang-gliding directly between its prodigious walls.Having said all of that, ""Goblet"" is not terrible, and the massive amount of genuine effort is apparent. The majority of credit for the movie's success though stems from the original story, which weaves classic motifs into a richly textured saga. To transform the book into a bad movie would be a truly stunning feat, one not accomplished here. Many of the effects-laden magical scenes are a treat despite being underdone, and familiar characters in new situations are rarely dull. Most of the adult actors are virtually reduced to cameos; but they perform admirably, except Michael Gambon, who is misrepresenting Dumbledore by stressing anger over wisdom. Separating the kids from their roles is difficult, and perhaps actors with more training could more effectively display a range of emotions, but even that is difficult to say, because these actors are their characters. Replacing these cinematic friends at this point would be utterly ludicrous.Overall, ""Goblet"" isn't bad, but neither is it actively good or absorbing. Very little wows or stokes emotional fires, a fact exacerbated by Azkaban's pronounced excellence in such situations. If the first and second movies were simple melodies, and the third blossomed into classic four-part harmony, then ""Goblet"" is a barbershop quartet in which at least one part struggles throughout, missing notes and creating a movie that never enraptures as it could, leaving the uninformed viewer partially in the dark, and the informed viewer underwhelmed, longing for a film that fully addresses all the fantastic elements that comprise ""Harry Potter & the Goblet of Fire"".Bottom Line: ""Goblet"" tries to soar to great heights, but finds itself chained down by its own shortcomings. 6 of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Not the Best, But Still Good","In Hogwarts, three different wizard schools compete in a dangerous competition called the Triwizard Tournament. The minimum age to participate is seventeen years old, but fourteen years old Harry Potter mysterious application is selected by the Goblet of Fire to be part of the game. Meanwhile, Harry Potter has dark nightmares, while Voldemort's Death Eaters are preparing the return of the evil Lord Voldemort.""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" is the weakest Harry Potter's movie, but it is still good. The plot with the very hazardous competition and the winter ball is very silly, and the strong part of the screenplay is the return of Lord Voldemort and his duel with Harry Potter.

Awesome!!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this awesome movie!! I am a Potter fan and the first 3 movies dint impress me that much. But in this one, the director had succeeded in doing justice to the book, and as he says, brought it out as an ""action epic"".Barring the over-energetic, screaming Dumbledore, I liked every bit of it. The acting from the trio (particularly Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint) has really improved, and their teenage woes are really well brought out. Ralph Fiennes was brilliant as Lord Voldemort, but the one who really stood out in the cast was Brendan Gleeson as Mad-Eye Moody! I was skeptical when pictures of Moody came out before the release, but I was compelled to change my mind after the movie.There are changes in the plot, but they settled well into the movie. A well deserved 10/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Goblet: Easily the best of the series, so far.","They're a little older; the direction is a little tighter; and the stories are a little darker, but the three kids remain fast friends, no matter what happens  or who comes between them.Of course, we're talking about Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and his buds, Hermoine Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Gint), who are now in their fourth year at the Hogwart School of Wizadry. And though not much of a Harry Potter fan myself, the action in this one was spectacular and the vision even darker as directed by Mike Newell (""Four Weddings and a Funeral,"" ""Donnie Brasco"") than part three, ""The Prisoner of Azkaban.""As per usual, sinister beings and evil magicians are pursuing Mr. Potter as he tries to complete his fourth year of school. To protect him, the academy's headmaster, Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon, ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"") assigns ""Mad Eye"" Moody (Brendan Gleeson, ""Braveheart"") to protect him.Meanwhile Hogwart's has been named the host venue for the annual Tri-Wizard competition, in which the best spellbinder from each school is chosen to represent their classmates. The competition is only for those 17 years of age and over, but, somehow, the magic Goblet of Fire spews fourth 14-year-old Harry's name, as well.Forced to battle dragons, evil mermaids and a horrible, claustrophobic hedge maze, Harry discovers he is fighting much more than just his Tri-Wizard opponents. This is made quite clear when his old nemesis Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes, ""Quiz Show,"" ""Schindler's List"") re-appears to face his young conquerer.The title character is hard-pressed as usual, but finds he can get just as far by using his heart and head rather than brute force or warlock powers.While dark and atmospheric for the most part, ""Goblet"" has some fun moments, as well. The opening Quiddich World Cup  between Ireland and Bulgaria  brief as it is, is still a wonder; also the Yule Ball  in which we get a hint of who is attracted to whom  is very well done, sweetly realistic and even a bit sad.Speaking of love, the hefty Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) falls head over heels for the 7-foot-plus French school headmistress, Madame Olympe Maime, in the film's best comedic moments.The most outstanding feature of the movie, however, is the terrific cinematography (by Roger Pratt, ""Troy,"" ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets""). His lush landscapes, snow-covered mountain peaks, towering spires and rich, barren forests are absolute wonders to behold. Look for an Oscar nod to come Pratt's way in January.And although a bit older than the 14-year-olds portrayed in the film (Gint is two years ahead of Watson in real life), the trio seems as young and fresh-faced as the author, J.K. Rowling envisioned them in this particular episode. For actors who have really only known one part in their careers, these three make the most of the opportunity and do a fine job.Overall, though a tad slow in a few spots, the picture is a triumph of good storytelling, sincere acting, amazing cinematography and seamless special effects, making it easily the best of the four in the series, so far.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The best of all parts,"What does a 14 year old do when he enters the game of adults. The fight against Dragons, the direct encounter with Voldemort were scenes enough to give goosebumps. The yes the unfateful demise of Cedric Diggory was a heart touching one. Friends for all times, the beautiful age of loving making; the chemistry of Hermoine, Ron and Victor Krum added to the story. Harry comes ous strong and victorious yet suffers the death of his friend. Most amusing of all parts. Must watch for all.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Best Yet,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is not the best of the Harry Potter books, in fact its about in the middle, but in the case of the movie it is by far the best of the movies in fact it is almost a great movie and possibly better than great films such as On the Waterfront and Saving Private Ryan. The cutting out of lead characters from the original films seemed like a major mistake when I first read it, but ends up being one of the best things about the new Potter film. The lack of the dreaded Dursleys and of Mrs. Weasly only help put us in th mind of Harry Potter as he becomes more of a teenager and less of a child. The only character missing that would help is that of Sirius Black who is you hear narrate a letter and see a computer generated face but is barley in the movie. The acting and direction are both really great the standout performances are by Brendan Gleeson as Mad Eye Moody, and there's a major surprise in a great performance by Emma Watson as Hermione who has seemed slightly lost in all the other films and never really worked before. The visual effects are some of the best ever put on film, the only ones that could match it at all are those in The Return of the King, War of the Worlds, and Revenge of the Sith. This is one of the best films of the year, and the best of the gradually great series.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Extreme Change Leaves Loyal Viewer Confused,"I am an avid Harry Potter Fan of both the books and the movies, though they are separate entities, and was very psyched to see this new film. This film was good, but there was something different about it. J.K.Rowling did in fact say once that she had never felt the same way about her books after the 3rd one, and her writing style did change, as is evident to those who have read the books. That change was widely accepted, but, in my opinion, this movie was a bit too different for my liking.Firstly, though the book was meant to do this, I felt utterly blown away at the end of the film. Not because I was in awe, merely because I felt as though the film had raced on at a whirlwind pace and left me behind during the second hour. It was very hard to keep up with the plot as it zoomed away into the unknown. I have read all the books twice or more and happen to be in my teens, so do not label me as a stuck-in-their-ways old person who still believes in black and white television. I am at the lower half of the target audience for this movie and am still bemused over what occurred on that screen.Another reason I was a bit skeptical about this film is that quite a few entertaining plots were left out; but mainly some important plot points of plots that were included in this motion picture. I agree that Mike Newell and Steven Kloves could not follow this book word for word in two and a half hours, but the other three films did relate very closely to the books. This movie felt set apart, but not necessarily in a good way.I will withhold complete judgment until I can see the directors cut, but I actually believe it could have been better as two movies, if it meant that important plot points could have been left in, such as why exactly Barty Crouch died, which seemed quite random in the book. I have always loved Harry Potter, and always will, but this film has definitely tested some loyal fans devotion.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Hello... plot? Are you under the invisible blanket?,"My girlfriend is a huge Harry Potter fan, so she eventually roped me into watching this cinematic train wreck.Let's start with what I liked, first. Solid opening scene, good special effects, interesting fantasy elements, and sometimes funny dialog. Now I ask fans to hold their breath. I did not like this movie.After the first quarter of the film, where it has been pointed out with a BIG NEON SIGN that the big bad uber-evil Wizard that everyone is so afraid of they refuse to speak his name, is returning from pseudo-death. Then, for some psychotic reason, the movie decides to forget about this imminent threat to the universe and instead show us poorly written, badly acted, and horribly uninteresting high school soap opera complete with a freaking prom. Maybe this is a hit with the middle school crowd, but even still, you can tell the actors themselves are thinking ""what the hell IS this about?"" EVENTUALLY, everyone remembers (a touch too late) that the evil ""you-know-who"" seems to be making his way back to life through foreshadowing and not-so-subtle hints, but now we're caught up in a life or death competition where Harry Potter has been illegally entered, and set up basically as bait to lure out Voldemort and/or his henchmen. Well, when the big bad DOES finally make his move, the powerful Wizards completely fail to notice, or even remember, that Voldemort has taken the bait. A confrontation between Harry and his nemesis ensues, whereupon the young hero through the power of love from his dead parents, or some such nonsense, just barely makes it away with the corpse of a fallen Hogwarts student. So what happens now that everyone has absolute and undeniable proof that the most evil force ever has returned? They go on summer vacation. Right, nipping off on holiday, I'm sure he won't destroy the world until next term. From start to finish, this movie had me on the edge of my tolerance. I'm being generous with five out of ten here, but only because I feel there is the POTENTIAL for a good movie in here. Someone just needs to slap around the director and scrounge the cutting room floor.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Well worth it,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire has finally emerged...and didn't disappoint. Though some scenes seemed rushed (I would have liked to have seen more of the Quidditch World Cup, really) and the subplots were gone (No SPEW...poor Hermione), the overall tone of the book is still present.Though we can't forget the danger presented at the beginning of the film (in fact, if the music alone won't let you forget, the nonstop action and some of the characters' conversations will make sure you remember), there are still plenty of laughs (in fact, Moaning Myrtle's scene in the book has been expanded a bit in the film...providing plenty of amusement though poor Harry would probably say otherwise).Some things, I think, could have been done better (Sirius' head in the fire just looked goofy and Voldemort's ""I can touch him now"" line...well, it can be misconstrued quite easily by fanfic authors writing slash), other bits that I had worried about surprised me by being well done. The dragon, for instance, was great - and the scenes involving Cedric Diggory's death were handled well.Overall, 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Quite good adaptation of my fave book,"Goblet of Fire is my favorite of the Potter series because he's clearly out of his depth in the tournament but bit by bit he survives. I can certainly relate to that.I like the pruning done to shorten the film. I would have liked to see those pruned moments if possible, but I think what's left is pretty darn good. It's not art, but it's very solid entertainment.All in all I'm eighty percent happy with the film (would want it longer, but as it is, I enjoyed it very much).The things I love about Goblet: how they continued the look of Cuaron's Hogwarts, that covered walkway, the mountains and lakes. I love Brendan Gleeson's Moody, and I love the new battle in the first trial. I also like the interaction between the kids now, they seem to act like real British kids, with their idioms. After all, an American has been writing the script. I think Newell is emphasizing the Britishness of everything.I also love the moments given to most of the characters. They may not have WRITTEN lines, but they do have memorable scenes, like the Weasley twins, or Cedric Digory's moments when he shows he's not just a handsome hero but actually a decent guy, or Snape pulling back his sleeves shortly before reprimanding Potter and Weasley. I think these are Newell's specialty.Some minor complaints: though I praise the movie on its choices of what to omit, I do complain about the pace; it's just too quick. Yes, I ""get"" most of it and I am entertained and not helplessly confused, but everything seems to be such wonderful and yummy eye-candy, and even some of the more dramatic moments are quite good, that it makes me want to slow things down and savor. I'd understand scarfing down a fast food burger to get back to work ASAP, but it doesn't make sense to swallow whole a Chateaubriand and that's what this movie makes me want to do. I wouldn't mind another thirty minutes, honestly.It's going to take some time before I can decide which I like better, Prisoner of Azkaban or Goblet of Fire. I like the bold direction Prisoner had taken the series, and to me, Goblet only seems to continue it, though Goblet does this well. I like the feeling that Prisoner is less ""stuffed"" and ""rushed"" than Goblet, though Goblet's story is my favorite of the books (and I still prefer ""Goblet""'s story even in the movie version over ""Azkaban""'s movie version of the story).About the next few films, I like Order of the Phoenix the least, but I'm looking forward to the adaptation of the Half Blood Prince, and more Alan Rickman, yay!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Too rushed, missed the relationship element","I only give this movie a 6 out of 10 because it has to do with the Harry Potter series which I am dedicated to. I really felt that the movie missed the balance between the heartfelt comforting scenes contrasted with the darker elements. The film was quite dark and harried throughout, any fun and happy scenes were drained out of it. It felt very edited at times kind of like the most recent disappointing Star Wars trilogy. Like that trilogy it lacked in genuine character development that was evident in the first three HP movies as well as in the books. HPGOF was my favorite HP book but this movie is by far my least favorite of the films. With all of that said, there are some nice elements and decent acting in general. I quite enjoyed the dragon scene in the triwizard tournament, it was really scary and exciting, as was the end of the movie. I just wish they had taken more time to build emotion rather than just going from one point to another. Even with Cedrick's death I wasn't really that moved, where as in the book it was quite startling. The film really needed to be made into two movies and SLOWEEEEDDD DOWWWNNN to do justice to the book. The other complaint I will say is the new Dumbledore really doesn't capture the character the way the original actor from Movie 1 and 2 did. The new Dumbledore is very aggressive and almost violent at times. From reading the books, I always thought Dumbledore had quite a bit more self control - he was wise and balanced not so hectic. All in all, the movie was entertaining despite my criticisms, certainly better than most of the crap that is released to theaters these days. Here's hoping the next film is better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Enjoyable Harry Potter film with memorable moments,"Harry suffers recurring dreams as Hogwarts starts the tri-wizard cup.This is a strong entry into the franchise with great character moments and a solid introduction to an important antagonist.Harry Potter films always have a lot of storyline to cover and this one does it as well as possible with only minor pacing issues.The tri-wizard cup scenes have great spectacle and when we first see someone whose name shall not be mentioned it is a bit out of the blue, but nonetheless quite cinematic.The plus points for me are the coming of age moments between the three main protagonists that capture the awkwardness of teenage relationships and the darker aspects of growing up such as facing hard times and death.I especially like the themes of unity and friendship covered nicely in some of the dialogue from Dumbledore and in the actions of Harry during the tri-wizard cup. Friendship across boundaries such as nationality is an important message and it's great that the movie covers it explicitly.All performances are great but my favourites are Michael Gambon and Brendon Gleeson.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Captivatingly visual,"This is definitely the best HP movie yet because its racy,dark,well-enacted and critically for me, a beautiful movie.Beautiful as in the extraordinary shots of horizons, dragons, looming shadows, cheering crowds- they could even leave you teary-eyed.And the end allows for unexpected violence and an incredibly evil Ralph Fiennes- yes, Harry grows up; so does gorgeous Hermione and thankfully, so do the HP movies.Though for the uninitiated (few as they might be)the pace could be too hot to handle and Dumbledore disappoints...All in all, this instalment has literally everything...The movie never flags for sufficient twists and SFX specials keep you more than interested. Kudos to the young leads- for they have grown comfortable with their roles and are quite adept at handling the greater complexity. The support cast is good- but I can't quite help repeating myself with reference to the genius of Ralph Fiennes' cameo: you almost end up believing that only he could have done it for beyond the look, there is his sinister voice and gait that leave ""a scar"" on your psyche.And the confrontation towards the end is exhilarating. An awesome cinematic experience- it entertains immensely!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Acting coach required...,"Emma Watson is lovely but really could have done with an acting coach on this one. Rupert Grint is unexpectedly, to me at least, shaping up to be a fine actor. One can only hope that he can make the transition once the Potter series ends.CGI effects were good but not flawless. See for example, group of people walking through the forest, camera from the rear. See also Harry underwater with fins swimming away from the camera.Ralph Feinnes, Roger Lloyd Pack and David Tennant all excelled.Shame Julie Walters was cut. In a cynical moment I considered that only the elements worthy of turning into console games were left in. Shame on me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
does not do the book justice,"While I did enjoy the movie it did the book no justice. There were 5 major characters who were almost completely left out of the movie, there was no lead in at the end for the next movie, they tied up no loose ends, and excuse me by why are the Weasley twins in classes with Harry, Ron and Hermione? There were so many things that they could have done better that would have only taken moments... and although it added humor the dance lesson with Professor McGonagall was completely unnecessary... I was extremely disappointed with this movie by the end. I'm glad I saw it because it is still after all a Harry Potter movie... and I guess if you've never read the books it was probably a really great movie with a really great story but for someone who knows what happens all the twists and turns of the book this movie really left something to be desired... I don't feel it did Rowling justice... I really don't especially compared to the first 3.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
At last! Harry battles his archenemy...hormones!,"This is easily my favourite HP film. It has EVERYTHING: action/adventure, horror, romance, comedy, combining the light-hearted feel of the first two films with the overly dark/gothic feel of the third (without going over-the-top). The opening shot, where we follow snake-cam, with rather 'loose' interpretation of the now very familiar Harry Potter theme, establishes that this movie is going to be something different to what's come before. I appreciated the fact that while the prior films had somewhat slow starts, this one skipped over the horrible Dursleys (seriously, WHY do they keep sending Harry back to his abusive relatives? It's totally messed up), who're always my least favourite parts of the films, and got straight into the action.Daniel Radcliffe feels like he's at last comfortable in the role Harry, who's much more angst-filled in this film (though also more sarcastic/amusing, which is welcome). Rupert Grint finally gets to do more as Ron than just simply acting scared/pulling funny faces, and the rift between him and Harry is interesting (I'll always remember Ron's telling Harry to ""Pi$$ off""). Emma Watson, like Radcliffe, seems more at ease in her role, and Hermione goes through a wide range of emotions in this film. I appreciate her friendship with Harry, and her arguing with Ron (whilst obviously they secretly care for each other) allows for some real emotionally-charged/interesting moments. All three work like a well-oiled machine at this point with their interaction/dynamic.While this might be an unpopular opinion, I actually really like Michael Gambon as Richard Harris' replacement playing Dumbledore (I know book readers had issues with him yelling at Harry, but I actually thought it showed some complexity, revealing another side to the character). Alan Rickman's Snape and Maggie Smith's McGonagall don't get much screentime, but do the most with what they're given (I thought the latter's scene, teaching Ron how to waltz, was quite amusing). The most interesting addition to the adult cast is Brendan Gleeson as Mad-Eye Moody, who's odd/quirky, but I'd almost say he's the most complex of the constantly revolving door of Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers thus far...except he's not all that he seems. Miranda Richardson is suitably irritating as Rita Skeeter, Gary Oldman stops by for a quick Sirius fireplace chat with Harry, and Ralph Fiennes gives a memorable debut performance as Voldemort in all his digitally-removed-nose glory.Regarding the new additions to the younger castmembers, pre-Twilight Robert Pattinson manages to make Cedric Diggory likable and his friendship with Harry *mean* something in the short amount of time we get to know him in, which proves crucial later on (as it shows that, to quote Hermione, ""Everything's going to change now""). His relationship with his father is also very effective. As for the other Triwizard Tournament champions, Stanislav Ianevski as Viktor Krum (who Ron has a man-crush on...that is until Krum beats Ron to the punch by asking Hermione to the Yule Ball) and Clémence Poésy as Fleur Delacour (who Ron also has a crush on, and manages to earn a kiss from at one point) are actually both the nationalities of the characters they're playing, which is appreciated (instead of having actors/actresses of other nationalities doing dodgy fake accents for the roles), and are good in their parts, though after the memorable entrances of their respective schools (Durmstrang and Beauxbatons), they don't get much to do/say.As for the non-Triwizard champions, Katie Leung also has very little to do in the movie as Cho Chang (other than smile and be on the receiving end of Harry's most awkward invitation to the Yule Ball ever. She has a lovely Scottish accent, though), as does Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy (he gets one memorable scene with Mad-Eye Moody). Neville Longbottom continues to get his own moments to shine, at least (though I wonder how Harry and Ron felt about Ron's sister, Ginny, being Neville's date to the Yule Ball. Even *Hagrid* gets some lovin' in this movie!).As well as all the wonderful characters, something else this movie excels at is its storytelling. Things keep going at an exhilarating pace that seldom slows down. The three Triwizard tasks are all unique, but exciting (the task featuring dragons is probably more memorable for *us* the audience than the spectators, since most of the dragon action takes place AWAY from where they're sitting). The second task's underwater scenes are appropriately spooky, while the final task (involving a giant hedge maze) is the 'darkest' section of the film, creating a real sense of terror/horror. However, there are enough laughs to balance out the darker moments. The score adds a lot to the film, but never takes you out of it (and doesn't play the HP theme ad nauseam like the previous films, thankfully). In my opinion, this film is the most thrilling, enjoyable, roller-coaster (or, more accurately, broomstick) ride in the series. Also, it'll probably always be remembered as the one where nobody got a haircut.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Saved by the Near-Perfect Ending,"By the standards of the first three movies, this film was definitely a let down, that I somewhat disliked until that ending. This movie was just really weird for the first two hours, and it felt like the main trio were missing something. For one part of the movie, Ron was angry at Harry, and then for another part Hermione is mad at Ron. This movie just felt off...but the ending did restore the image of the movie in my opinion, because it sets up the remaining movies so well.

GOOD Movie,"The HP movies get better every time a new installment comes out. The cast is great, the special effects are perfect, and the story rocks. What else could you want in a movie? First of all, Daniel Radcliffe fits the Harry Potter part perfectly. He has the same, ""Whatever, I just want to get through the school year"" kind of attitude, just like in the books. This movie was also the perfect length. Every scene was well done, and I think the director did a fantastic job. Also, many teenagers along the female variety found some of the guys in here very attractive, including myself, but that's not really relevant. Anyway, I think this movie was so well done, and although the next film isn't expected to come out for a while, I really am looking forward to it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Enjoyed it as a movie,"Prior to seeing 'Goblet of Fire' I have never read any of the novels. I was just a fan of the movies since their debut. But after watching 'Goblet' I was finally convinced to start reading the series. That's the effect this film had on me and now I'm very much into the Harry Potter world. I can see that this one was rushed more so than the others, I wouldn't have mind if it was longer, but unlike me most people would object. I think what is most satisfying, especially to someone who never read the books before is that Harry, Ron, Hermione and everyone else is growing up and the problems they face are getting more serious. I've seen 'Goblet' three times now and I plan on seeing again it on IMAX. So for those who are already avid readers of this Rowling series, it does cover the important points, but they are rushed. And for those who are just movie-goers who could care less about the actual book itself, I think you're in for a real treat.

Superb adaption of the book.,"Let me start off with stating that I am not a HP fan. I've read the books, and thought they were fairly entertaining, but nothing special, The first 2 films were adequate, but once again nothing special. I liked the 3rd film because it began to delve into a more sinister and darker tone...which I must say is the setting for this film.Story: As most people know, Harry Potter is now back at school with friends and foes, but now had been anonymously selected to take part in a competition amongst three different schools. It's good to see that all the films have a sense of structure, starting off with harry going to school, investigation around the school and then ending with a finale and him leaving school. What I did like about this film, is how it took out Harry's Aunt and Uncle, which meant it gave extra critical time to the actual story development (which is a good thing considering the book is massively bigger compared to the other 3)Acting: Acting wise, everyone is good, not brilliant but not under-average. It's good to see the children actors / actresses finally sink into their roles, whereas in the first 2 films (and sort of 3rd) they seemed rather hesitant at times. Michael Gambon, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltraine and the brilliant Brendan Gleeson are all charming and bring unique qualities to their own characters.Special Effects: Overall they were superb, the dragons, backdrops and even the little things (floating candles) were done superbly and really made u feel emerged in the fantasy world of HP.Overall the film is excellent and well worth a watch. However, if your expecting a light-hearted and innocent trip through Hogwarts, be warned...things are a lot darker and sinister.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Awesome Movie, director has done a good job ....","Well, I am not a Harry Potter fan, I never read the books and it never bothers me, but as my friends took me to this movie, I immediately fell for this. I recognized a very deep character change / alter, which is totally new in the Potter movies (I watched 1,2,3 directly afterwards). The characters grew up and mutate into young sentimentally people with many adventures and creatures and particularly magic. What can I say, it's truly the best Harry Potter movie ever, and I hope the next will get even better, what I really doubt.

Missed Opportunity,"There was an opportunity for the 4th installment in the Harry Potter franchise to be nothing short of great. But I simply can't agree with those who have given this movie a high review, and here's why: As suggested by others, in order to bring a 700+ page book into a 2-1/2 hour movie, some (or a lot) of story elements would have to be deleted. Normally this isn't an insurmountable problem. However, in 'The Goblet of Fire' story, it is exactly those 'extra' elements that make this story wonderful. If there's one thing anyone who has read most or all of the J.K. Rowling books knows, it's that there are no unnecessary, unimportant, or otherwise 'extra' elements in her stories. That is one of the key reasons the books are cut above everything else. The end result for the movie is that we are left with an extremely jumpy storyline that simply follows the critical path, providing the viewer with only the most basic information to keep the plot moving forward. There is absolutely no in-depth character development whatsoever. The book was FILLED with wonderful character background history, especially the Professor Moody character. The movie barely scratched the surface. In addition, there was little or no continuity between the major scenes, and almost no feel for the passage of time. This was supposed to be an entire school year, but other than the changes in the weather, the audience would never know it. For anyone who's been to Disneyland, the best analogy I can think of is that this movie is like taking a trip to Disneyland, staying only 2 or 3 hours and only going on the 3 biggest rides - then rushing back home to heat up some microwave dinner. Now, absolutely that beats a trip to the dentist. But when you get home and think back to all of the things you missed, will you really be satisfied with the experience? I wouldn't . . . and I wasn't. Look, the bottom line is that these books (starting with Azkaban) needed to be multi-part movies, similar to Kill Bill Vol 1&2 or the last 2 Matrix movies which were actually one movie broken into 2 parts. Azkaban needed to be a 2-part movie and 'Goblet of Fire' needed to be 3-part. What really blows me away is that the studio doesn't recognize this. It couldn't have taken much more (if any) production time to make a 6 or 7 hour 3-part movie. In fact, I wouldn't doubt that the cutting room floor already contains the other two movies. Ticket sales would be just as high for each of the 3 episodes as it would be for the one (as proved by the Matrix), so why not maximize the studio profit and the audience viewing pleasure by giving this movie the full attention to detail it truly deserves?",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Harry Potter rocks!,"This was an awesome movie! I took my wife, who is not a Harry Potter fan (Neither was I for that matter!), to see this movie. The theater was jam packed with kids and adults alike, and especially one annoying girl who kept screaming and calling out the names of all the characters!!! My daughter(who is only 3) loved all the scenes (Yes, she was wide awake throughout the movie!!!)! I'd say this movie is definitely for kids (and the kid in all of us!). Harry and the gang growing up to be adults and their love interests were well rendered. Radcliffe as Harry was charming and so was Ms Watson, who is blossoming into a charming lady. Ron did n't seem to have too much to say in this movie I think. Lot of puns on him though!! Poor Ron!!!The visual effects were fantastic as usual and the return of Lord Voldemort pretty ghastly. My wife thought he looked ghastly! The only haunting experience was the death of a fellow Hogwarter, which I believe kids don't like. Also, maybe the 'competition' did look rather too heavy and gruesome for kids.The Potter mania continues!!! We wait impatiently for the next Harry Potter film, and my advice to Ms Rowling...please don't kill Harry Potter!!! It ain't worth it!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Loved It!,"I loved the movie! I know somethings were left out or changed, but it was great!Low points - Dumbledore was not as portrayed in the book. He's so great, but not in the movie. The underwater prisoners were more like fake dummies. Yuk!High Points - Everything else! The scene at the Quiddich World Cup and the Death Eaters was EXACTLY how I imagined it! I loved seeing the students from the other schools and Hogwart's reaction to them! Love and hormones are in the air!I want to go see it again!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Dumbledore Train Wreck,"Yes, I liked the special effects. Yes, I liked the improvement in skill of the actors. However, the director needs to be slapped around for allowing the Dumbledore character to be completely misrepresented. He is supposed to be a calm, level, even-tempered ""rock"" for Harry in his times of trouble. This character needs meds. How very disappointing. I took my 12 and 13 year-old children to see the movie tonight and none of us were happy with the film. Of course, HP fans will need to see it. However, we all believe that it lacked depth, went WAY too fast through important background material, and neglected the sub-plots beyond forgiveness. In summary, we were all disappointed in the film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"Wow, poor Harry just can't get a break and a decent year at Hogwarts? Well, I just completed the series that is on DVD at least, hoping to see the new Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix this weekend with my friends, looking forward to it. I'm glad I finally broke down and watched these movies, I knew I had to give in some time since these films are just going to keep coming, you know? Well, The Goblet of Fire is so far the darkest Harry Potter I've seen, but also the best. I loved the whole concept of how Harry can face evil magic, wizards, and dragons, but his scariest time yet: the truth about the birds and the bees. So far I have to say that Goblet of Fire is my favorite Harry Potter film.Harry is now in his fourth year in Hogwarts and there is a huge contest that is going on for a grand prize, only thing is from each wizard school, only one is chosen to win the prize and you must be 17 or older to enter, but for some odd reason Harry is chosen to participate even though he is only 14. Facing extremely difficult obstacles, he pulls through and makes it in time for the big ball dance that Hogwarts is throwing and he and Ron must find a way to get a date. But there is more trouble when Lord Voldemort is finally about to rise and I don't think Harry is on his good side.The Goblet of Fire was a brilliant movie and is probably my new favorite of the Harry Potter films. It had amazing effects and great acting as usual. It was different as well since the kids are now a little more grown up, so they are facing scary adventures, but it's very exciting to watch. I cannot wait for the Order of Phoenix and see where Harry Potter will take us next. Then I guess it's off to the books since I should probably see what everyone is talking about when they say how the books don't compare to the films.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Not as fresh but still interesting,Unfortunately the film overall is much more uninteresting than it the previous one but thankfully we still have all of the very rich and layered characters and they're relationships with each other to make up for that.,7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Not the best installment of the series...,"I found this installment of the Potter series hard to follow, and frankly, dull and boring. The ""extra"" characters from other schools dilute the ""feel"" of the film. It departs too far from the magic as it pertains to Harry Potter's life and destiny, and relies too much on special effects.Also, not enough Snape ;-)Since the kids are getting older, they have to be given boys and girls to fall for, which turns me right off, as such storylines always slow down films. (I'm a female who HATES chick flicks)... and that is exactly what happens.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Amazing!  Best of the four!,"I'll admit, I was a bit nervous going into the release of this movie. While I have loved all the Harry Potter movies thus far, I was slightly disappointed with the third movie (which accounted to my slight nerves with this movie). However, I was happily mistaken in my assumptions. As soon as this movie began, I realized how wrong I was.The visual effects throughout the entire movie were seamless and impressive. The casting was phenomenal--I was thoroughly impressed with the choices for the characters of Fleur, Krum, Cedric, and Rita Skeeter (she turned out exactly as I pictured her while reading the books).Going into the movie I was also a bit nervous about how the movie was going to turn out, as there was a new composer for the soundtrack for this movie, but I was proved wrong for that as well. The music was absolutely amazing! On top of all that, the costumes were, as usual, amazing, as was the makeup. Overall, this movie beat out the other three by a landslide and I can't wait for the fifth!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
the best yet,"I have seen Goblet of Fire twice in the last week and thoroughly enjoyed it both times. It was energetic...there are very few 'down times' in the movie. It is remarkably accurate, both in detail and atmosphere. I was very impressed by the depth Daniel Radcliffe showed in this movie...he is definitely growing as an actor (which is very interesting as he only got into this business by accident...neither he nor his parents went looking for it). All in all a fantastic 2 and a bit hours of entertainment that leaves you wanting more....I can hardly wait for Order of the Phoenix...looking forward to Umbridge!!!

"Good Movie, poor representation of a book.","First and foremost, let me tell you that the movie was worth seeing and I'll definitely add it to my collection of DVD's when it comes out. However, I must say that I was disappointed. Yes it was a large book, and I didn't expect them to fit everything in, but they tried, and they shouldn't have.As I watched it, I was impressed with the special effects and the action, but they jumped around so much that it was totally impossible to personalize with any of the characters, and it was hard to genuinely enjoy the film. The conversation, what conversation there were, were so short and spotted that it was hard to follow if one has not already read the book and knew what was going on.As far as movies go, it was excellent, but as far as a movie based upon a book, I feel that they have failed. A particular low point was the World Quidditch cup, and a particular high point was Voldemort (they portrayed his return very well indeed).Again, I loved the movie, but I have to watch it with the idea that it is just a movie, and not the fourth book in the Harry Potter series.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Does not live up to the book,"I am an avid Harry Potter fan, but I have to say that this movie did even come close to the book. I think it was in part due to bad directing. The beginning scenes zoom by and goes straight into the action. Anyways, this movie tries to stay very true to the book. Tries. Most of the important things and a few details are all in there, but it seems as though the director was racing to cram as much as he could into the movie, instead of focusing on giving it a sensible storyline. Each scene was given only cursory attention, even if they were extremely important. For example, lets take the Quidditch World Cup. We don't know where they're going until they actually arrive, and even then the name is only mentioned once. There is no quidditch action, it goes straight from introducing the team to showing the kids in their tent after the game. Even I was thrown off balance for a bit. Then, all of a sudden, there are these black KKK guys.The entire movie goes on like this. It's just BOOM BOOM BOOM, one blast after another of isolated snapshots of the book. It's more of a slideshow than a movie, the ""snapshots"" seem unconnected in any logical way. I was able to follow the movie only because I had read the book well; if you haven't or read it a long time ago, it would be a very good idea to read it again before seeing this.The special effects are nice though. The Quidditch stadium and the dragons are very nicely rendered, and are very immersive. Unfortunately, that the only thing I can think that stands out as REALLY good about this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"A fabulous film, but could have been even better","I saw this film last weekend and whilst I thought it was great, it could have been even better, had the content of the first hour not been so obviously 'rushed'.With the size of the book, it was always going to be a challenge to turn it into the film, but if the film had been just 30 minutes longer, I think the overall translation would have been so much better for it. At just over three hours, it would still have been shorter than LOTR The Return of the King was and that film is not too long, in my opinion...Having said that, the content and effects of this film are great and a continued progression from the previous film. It's still definitely worth seeing, but I still wish there had been more of the book on the screen, as I left a little disappointed...",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"It's time for a Kill Bill, multiple volume approach to these movies.","This might just be due to the fact that Goblet of Fire was the first Harry Potter book I actually read. After seeing the first three movies, I began to enjoy the storyline and background developments quite a bit. So when I happened to read Goblet by chance, I could not have been more excited for this movie to come out. Now, lacking the history of reading the three previous books, this might be an observation already accepted by those who have read them prior to watching the first three movies. But for me, this was quite literally one of the worst film adaptations I have ever seen in my life. This film carelessly left out some of the more interesting and key elements of the book. Not only that, but those elements it did leave in failed to convey the meaning, relevance and emotion of the book.In an effort to save time, important character development was blatantly left out of this film. With it's breakneck pace moving through the elements of the book as if it were skipping chapters at a time. Not only did it limit the effectiveness of this film. But it already cripples the next book's (The Order of the Phoenix) ability to make a worthy adaptation.Rowlings book contains so many plot elements and so much character development, that it they can simply not be brought to the big screen in one fell swoop. This movie and easily the adaptations to come would benefit greatly by taking some queues from Quentin Tranatino. You could have easily made two movies from Goblet of Fire alone. And the director would have been able to maintain the story's developmental structure.As a movie, it's not bad. But to be honest, it really isn't that great either. As mentioned before it moves from one event to the next with such speed and lack of set-up it is like a scene to scene versions of a jump-cut. The inability to dazzle me with effects, while still being an effect laden film is equally disappointing. The mystique of the Beuxbaton girls was non-existent. The gloomy and dark presence of the Durmstrang students was noticeable for about one second as they first entered the great hall. Not to mention the casting for Viktor Krum was equally poor. On the whole, the acting (especially from the main three, Radcliffe, Grint & Watson) was sub-par. This book had the potential for an amazing film. Now, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who has read the book.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The least satisfying episode,"It was a long sit, but in the end it felt so unsatisfying. Almost like a waste of time.

If this movie is part of the doubleheader...I must say this movie was the least satisfying movie-episode since Star wars part 1.Even though the visuals were stunning...you weren't able to engross yourself inside the movie.6 out of 10 because it was such a disappointment.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Do not do so lightly! If chosen, there's no turning back. As from this moment, The Triwizard Tournament has begun!","Year four at Hogwarts for Harry Potter and his chums, and it's a time of change, chance and danger. The prestigious Triwizard Tournament is being hosted and the applecart is turned upside down when Harry, unqualified and underage, is selected by the Goblet of Fire to be one of Hogwarts' competitors. If the thought of competing in such a dangerous tournament wasn't scary enough, Harry also has the worry of finding a date for the Yule Ball to contend with!The Prisoner of Azkaban set the marker for a darker, more grown up Potter picture, a high standard that Goblet of Fire, and new director Mike Newell, arguably had no hope of attaining. But it's not for lack of trying, and in fairness Newell and the team have managed well enough to blend the blackness that comes with the impending arrival of Lord Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes), with the burgeoning ping of teenager hormones. There's an awful lot going on here. With the Triwizard Tournament comes two groups of exchange students to Hogwarts in the form of the glamorous girls of Beauxbatons Academy, and the hunky boys of Durmstrang Institute. The arrival of which sends Ron, Hermione and co into blushy flustered awakenings. The tournament itself (rightly) dominates much of the film, the lead up to it and the three challenges that the competitors have to face, with Harry's dragon face off a bona fide excellent piece of film. Then on to the fall out of the tournament where it gets real dark and the film and series lurch on to another level and set up the next installment a treat.As is customary for a Potter film, there's also a number of new characters and replaced characters in the mix, while major story developments flit in and out of the narrative to the point you really have to pay attention completely. Of the new arrivals it's Alastor ""Mad-Eye"" Moody (Brendan Gleeson terrific) who is most telling and enjoyable, but tabloid scribe Rita Skeeter (Miranda Richardson) is something the film could have survived without. Yes it's a nice pop at the gutter press, but watching it now, would the time spent wasted on Skeeter not have been better served on the sadly under filmed Quidditch World Cup? Especially considering the build up to it is magnificent. Or at the very least some more Malfoy Senior, Sirius or Snape! But the disappointment felt there is offset some by the wonderful Yule Ball, where Newell is in his element gleefully dangling his charges through the joys and sorrows of awkward awakenings. It's a series highlight that's not to be missed.A film of variable pace due to the makers trying to juggle so much, it's ultimately something of an up and down viewing experience. That said, Newell is able to dazzle the pre-teens with his set pieces, because the kiddies sure as hell will not understand the angst and hormonal issues present, while the rest plays out on adult terms. So something for everyone, then. It may not be successful as a whole, and newcomers dipping in for the first time get no guidance at all, but it's still a ripper of a ride for those who are into the films having not read the books. It's set up nicely for part 5, but pity poor David Yates in the directing chair for Order of the Phoenix, though, for that is one hell of a door stopper novel to try and condense down into an entertaining Potter movie! 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Goblet fires up Potter Lovers (Both in good ways and bad),"This latest installment of the Harry Potter series is by far the best of the series so far. The characters and the school become a much more realistic view of adolescents and teenagers and dealing with life, love, and relationships. Harry Potter purists will definitely find holes in the plot, but ultimately the changes made were for the betterment of the movie. Newell does an excellent job at limiting changes to what was necessary to fit the time constraints, and most Harry Potter lovers will be able to forgive him.

Good effort,"Although the pace of the movie seemed a bit too fast, I guess it was actually difficult to condense the 636 page book into a 150 minute movie. The graphics used were excellent, and seemed quite realistic. I felt it was a good movie for the one who's read the book, and had a background (seen the previous movies). If not, he/she's gonna have a tough time trying to grasp whatever's shown. The casting's also pretty decent, especially in the case of Cho Chang, Parvati/Padma Patil, Madame Maxime, and Rita Skeeter, and they've lived up to their characters. I was shocked at the non-inclusion of Winky, the elf, and also at the fact that Barty Crouch Jr. was shown conjuring the Dark Mark, when in the book, it has been kept as a secret. They've also not included even a hint of S.P.E.W, the House-Elf Liberation Front, the fact that it's Moody who saves Harry Potter from Snape's office and takes the Marauder's Map, and a lot more (for those who're wondering what all this is, go read the book).

I never thought I would say this...,"The Acting saved this movie. As an avid fan of the books and the previous movies I've always had my complaints about the movies. I was particularly concerend about this movie because there was so much material and so many subplots that all seemed relevant that I wondered how it would be done. I agree with the fact that making two movies probably would have cost too much and may have ruined the series (ala matrix) BUT there were a few key details that were integral to the next book that were left out. Without going too much into that, its evident that the acting of the 3 main stars has vastly improved and to be quiet honest this movie would have failed without them. If you watch the movie from the beginning you can see that not only have the characters developed but so have the actors. Their working with very limited material and they do a heck of a good job. I will not say too much of the directing because the previous two directors took many liberties and Mike Newell is no exception. To be quite honest I think it lived up to my expectations and not more. If we want to go into technicality I would give it an 8.7/10 but its just easier to round up.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Harry's Baptism by Fire,"In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the fourth in the Harry Potter series, the adrenalin of competition, fear of the unknown and the surge of adolescent hormones make for a powerful potion indeed. This is a story of tournaments and trophies, where heroes are simultaneously idolized and envied. And it is a story fuelled by adolescence, with all the agony and uncertainty that accompanies self-awareness.Adapted from the J.K Rowling book by Steve Kloves, who also adapted the three previous films, Director, Mike Newell, set out to create ""an absolutely classical thriller"". He admits to being ruthless in taking out elements of the book that are not consistent with this genre. With no time for our banal Muggle world, the film concentrates on the Magical realm with its limitless ability to amaze and surprise. As he builds on the dark moodiness of the previous film, Newell does provide some humorous relief and there is a highly suggestive and infectious thread of romantic opportunities.As with the previous films, the CGI special effects are phenomenal and key to creating the magical and dramatic world of Hogwarts. With the entire film immersed in the world of magic, the integration of the special effects in The Goblet of Fire appears seamless and utterly convincing.The return of the Voldemort's faithful followers, the Deatheaters, and their disruption of the Quidditch World Cup sets an ominous tone for another contest, The Triwizard Tournament. The tournament pitches champions from three of the largest schools of wizardry against each other. Delegations from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang dramatically arrive at Hogwarts to learn that the Ministry of Magic has imposed an age restriction on contenders  only students who are 17 years or older will be considered to represent their school. The selection of the 3 competing champions falls to the powerfully magical object called the Goblet of Fire.Although Harry Potter is only 14 and clearly not interested in the ""eternal glory (that) awaits the student who wins the tournament."" he is the unprecedented fourth champion selected by the Goblet. And so Harry is pitted against the other more mature and able champions in 3 life-threatening tasks that rely on both his knowledge and use of magic to succeed. If this was not daunting enough, the dark forces of evil manipulate and intimidate and Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is finally given form.But there is more than just magic in the air. Harry and his friends are battling to discover who they are and becoming more aware of those around them. The film masterfully illuminates this key crisis of adolescence. There is heightened excitement in the preparation for the Yule Tide Ball and the agony of securing a desirable dance partner in time.As in previous films Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), the only known person to ever survive the unforgivable curse of Avada Kedavra, is often an onlooker  observing from the sidelines. He is thrust into the spotlight against his will and without confidence in his abilities. He confesses ""I'm not ready for this"" only to be told ""You don't have a choice"" and in response to the question ""What are your strengths?"" he quickly admits ""Really, I don't know"".Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) is responsible for many of the humorous quips in the film. A sports-loving, bum-ogling teenage boy whose mother has no idea of acceptable attire, he cannot help being envious of Harry and battles through the confusion of his role in events. ""Yeah, that's me. Ron Weasley. Harry Potter's stupid friend."".Perspicacious and practical Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) seems to be way ahead of the boys in all things and is often frustrated by their lack of maturity and insensitivity. Though she does not suffer many of their insecurities, she cannot escape the changing dynamics of their friendship. Ron tactlessly tries to invite her to the Ball with ""You're a girl"" and she retorts ""Oh, well spotted"".Whether a tribute to Mike Newell's directorship or a testament to their experience and maturity, all 3 of the key players  Radcliffe, Watson and Grint - deliver their best performances to date.The film also introduces Mad-eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson), who is staggering as the new teacher of Defence Against the Dark Arts. He is an incredibly damaged visual reminder of the dangers of battling against evil. And the sensationalist reporter, Rita Skeeter (Miranda Richardson) is appropriately brash with overt sex appeal and her lurid imagination.From the awesome sensory overload of the Quidditch World Cup, where the stadium rocks with adrenalin, to the Triwizard Tournament at home at Hogwarts, hormones and competition rage and the pace of the film rarely lets up. Unfortunately, Evil is only just thwarted from outright victory, but Harry and his friends do win the battle for the emotional maturity we know they are going to need in the even darker times ahead.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Falters a bit, but still entertaining","That moment when Hermione sees that Harry has survived the dragon - Emma Watson is so wonderful there. Overall, J. K. Rowling's series is on the mainstream side of the genre and this one has some unfortunate stereotyping, but it's engaging nonetheless. Her 4th book was decent enough but bloated, presenting a challenge to any adaptation, and I can't say this film was completely successful. There are many times where it felt disjointed or rushed. On the other hand, Ralph Fiennes makes for a fierce Lord Voldemort (kudos to the makeup department), and the challenges the adolescent wizards are put through provide a dark contrast to the scenes of teenage awkwardness and the humor the film goes for. It probably would have been better had it focused more on the Triwizard Tournament than the Yule Ball and Ron Weasley's silly jealousy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Mixed feelings,"First let me say that I have read all the Harry Potter books. I am not biased as far as the movies go because that is a totally different deal. Watching the film though, I felt as if I was watching it in fast forward. The film felt rushed. I understand that there is quite a bit of material in the book to sort through and bring to life in a film but had I not read the books I would have been totally confused as to how to follow it. I brought along with me to the theater an assortment of friends and some have read the books and some have not. Those who had not could not follow along at the pace of the movie and kept asking me questions throughout it. Some who had were still totally confused. I liked the look of the film, was blown away by it actually and the special effects as well but as far as the storyline goes, it felt rushed through. Thats why I gave it only an 8 because I felt they could have done a bit better. I'll have to see it again though to pick up anything I missed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"I enjoyed watching the newest Harry Potter film and recommend you view it as well. Overall, the movie captured the main points of the novel, but left out the factors that led to them. Such as the house-elves. The house-elves played a key role in the novel and because they were taken out of the movie, several scenes had to be altered. The actors and actresses were superb! I was a little shocked when Dumbledore seized Harry the way he did when his name came out of the Goblet though, because in the novel, no such reaction took place from Dumbledore. Aside from that one scene though, everyone was great. I impress my recommendation that the next 3 novels be released on film, containing the actors Rupert Grint and Daniel Radcliffe, and actress Emma Watson. They all fit the description given by Rowling and are wonderful. As well, the new characters, Viktor Krum, Fleur Delacour, and Cedric Diggory, along w/ their schoolmates and Professors, Mad-Eye Moody, and so on, were terrific! These movies will be cherished for ages and keep up the good work!",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
surely a wonderful movie for readers of Harry but for others???,"I saw the movie last night and it deserves being watched. I really enjoy the film as a H.P. fan. However, this film is really hard to understand for people who haven't read the fourth book, so if you haven't read the book you most probably won't like this movie.. for readers it's just another fun and a new question: ""How will be the next film?"" On the other hand, Mike Newell couldn't improve the quality of the film as much as Alfonso Cuaron did. I think that the directors' understanding of the characters were quite different from the book; especially Dumbuldore was seemed to be were angry and excited unlike the book in which he was usually calm. My other disappointment about the film is the final of the film. The scenes in which Voldemort appears lacks being scary and exciting especially when compared with the scenes full of Dementors in the third film. In short surely a wonderful movie for readers but for others???",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Hero Emerges,"In ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" Harry (now older Daniel Radcliffe) arises as a hero. Though not a literary reference, Harry Potter's emergence is reminiscent of another dark hero in ""Batman Begins"". In that movie, Bruce Wayne's mentor Ducard tells his charge, ""The training is nothing! Will is everything! The will to act."" Granted aside from both movies being Warner Brothers productions, the analogy is not that far fetched. Director Mike Newell's fourth installment of the Harry Potter saga is the series' darkest and perhaps best. Harry (wonderfully played by Radcliffe) acknowledges and reclaims his greatness albeit reluctantly. He battles great evil and his own fear and insecurities through sheer willthe will to act. The evolving Radcliffe embodies his Harry with the right balance of vulnerability and courage as his character believes the best in others while acknowledging his own demons. Mike Newell masterfully crafts his hero's journey reflecting the great storytelling of author J.K. Rowling and screenwriter Steven Kloves. Hogwarts Headmaster Dumbledore advises young Harry, ""Soon we must face the choice between what is right and what is easy."" ""Harry Potter"" under the guidance of Newell does right. It's about character.""Goblet of Fire"" opens with Harry, Hermione (Emma Watson), and Ron (Rupert Grint) attending the Quidditch World Cup. However, things go horribly wrong. The arrival of the Death Eaters and the Dark Mark in the skies foretell of the return of Lord Voldermort (malevolent Ralph Fiennes).Representatives of two other rival schools arrive at Hogwarts to participate in the Triwizard Tournament. The names of the school champions are selected from the Goblet of Fire. The competition is restricted to 17 year-olds. The three champions selected are Viktor (Stanislev Ianevski), Fleur (Clemence Poesy), and Cedric (Robert Pattison) from Hogwarts. Surprisingly The Goblet of Fire makes a fourth selection: 14 year-old Harry. All contestants must endure three challenges where they could possibly forfeit their lives. Harry has the least training of the four. Also Harry knows he must eventually face Lord Voldermort, the man who killed his parents and failed to kill Harry himself.This dark story of redemption is a compelling hero's tale. At it's emotional center is a powerful and compassionate performance by Daniel Radcliffe as Harry. He has great support from Emma Watson and Rupert Grint. Michael Gambon is perfect as the brave and wise Dumbledore. An almost unrecognizable Ralph Fiennes is a powerful force as the evil Voldermort. In ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" Radcliffe's Harry arises from the ashes like the Phoenix reclaiming and embracing his inherent greatness, and inspiring greatness in others. It is not the training or wizard's talent, rather the power he distinguishes deep inside himself that saves Harry. Harry finds the will to act, and fights great evil while reconciling his own fear.Mike Newell's ""Goblet of Fire"" establishes Harry Potter as hero. Daniel Radcliffe as Harry has emerged as a gifted and powerful young actor. May the evolving story of the wizard Harry Potter in the movies continue to transform and compel as this movie does.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Good, but not good enough...","Knowing that it was Mike Newell who was going to direct the film i thought even before seeing it that i wouldn't like it. I was wrong. The film is very funny and remains , in that way, faithful to the book... The actors are brilliant, the kids keep getting better and better, Miranda Richardson ( Rita Skeeter ) is hilarious and Ralph Fiennes (Lord Voldemort) is perfect... the twins are extremely funny especially when Fred (or George, can't tell one from the other) asks Angelina to go with him at the ball... However, enormous mistakes are made. the beginning is very disappointing, the most important informations are not given (we don't know, for example, that the house is the house of Voldy's parents...). We only see Sirius once, no one seems to care about what happen to Barty Crouch ( the one with the mustache) after he is seen unconscious in the woods and after saying over and over that the weird sisters were played by Jarvis Cocker and two radiohead members you only get to see them once. fortunately, the songs they play are brilliant. Finally, the end sucks.... everyone is happy and doesn't seem to be troubled by what just happened at Hogwarts....Mike Newell saw the funny aspect of the book, the incredible humor of JK Rowling (which is already good) but he missed the darkness of the book. Columbus had made a massacre of the books because is only interest was to focus on the story.Alfonso Cuaron had seen the atmosphere and the poetry of the books and that is why his movie was closer to the Harry Potter spirit and remains to that day the best harry potter film... The only director who could have seen the real pain, the real darkness that is in the 4th potter book and that we find again in the 5th and 6th book, is Tim Burton. When I read the books, it was like reading Burton's universe, his dark humor, his characters. Only his visual genius could have made a perfect adaptation of Harry Potter. Harry Potter and the goblet of fire is not the story of a boy who feels like an outsider because he doesn't know how to ask girls to dance with him. He is a teenager who has to face death and the dark side that is in him. Lord Voldemort is not just some crazy psychopath, he is Harry's double (through all the books Rowling shows us the similarities between Harry and the dark lord). Just like catwoman is divided by her two personalities Burton had already expressed that duality, that's why it's a pity that no one offered him the chance to do it one more time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
rush rush,"The next in the series that I have revisited.The film as a whole is again in excellent condition, the effects are good and the sets are beautiful and the acting is sufficient, but sometimes a bit mediocre by the 3 leading actors, but that is not so bad.The big downside, however, is the playing time that is too short, it all feels very rushed (again) and this is especially painful at the beginning of the Quidditch World Cup, we don't see anything of the match at all and suddenly the scene becomes very fast. Cut to that death eater scene.It may also have something to do with the fact that I have read the books, but in itself I think this kind of rushing through the story is a cardinal sin.This problem would only get worse over time, the magic becoming less, the rushing more and more annoying and quite frankly even frustrating.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Dumbledore, Voldemort and... almost every other character in this film are portrayed as though the director had never read any of the Harry Potter books in his life. I watched the film only once and will never watch it again... unless, I really want to torture myself with a type of pain that any cruciatus curse would ever deliver to a tasteful person's mind. P.S.

Harry Potter As It Should Be,"Word is going around that there were many plot holes in the movie from the actual adaption of the book. Yes, it is true. But the movie is wonderfully made and this is the first Harry Potter movie which has emotions in it. It is dark, dangerous and sometimes keeps you at the edge of your seat. The scenes are really well shot and the appearance of Voldemort in the graveyard is one of the most spectacular scenes in the movie. The movie shows us that Harry and his friends have now matured. It brings out the best in the actors and actresses. The movie has it share of humor as well and Ron is hilarious. The relation between Ron, Hermione and Harry is very touching and the wail of Mr. Diggory rings in your ears several minutes after the scene is over. The movie in true words is Magical.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Pretty good,"Well, they certainly did their best. The effects were excellent, the actors delivered what was needed at the exact moment and it stayed semi-close to the book. Although many things were left out, I can't say that I was surprised, because the book is 734 pages long. That would probably make for a 12 hour movie. There are more things that they should have added, but even without Dobby and Ludo Bagman, it was very entertaining. However, i would recommend reading the book before viewing the movie so that you can understand what is going on during the movie. It will make the inner workings of the plot make more sense to you and help you enjoy it more. All together, i enjoyed the movie and hope everyone else does.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Worth a watch but flawed, so flawed.","OK, first let me start by saying that this is probably by far the best of the Harry Potter films so far. Its darker and has more humor and will keep your interest while you are watching. So far so good.Its got some well handled direction and some imaginative and exciting filmography.However...Harry Potter character hasn't changed since the first movie - sacharin sweet and lacking depth, nevertheless the acting is still way below par from the actor.Drumbledore also stinks things up, likewise Robbie Coltrane.In contrast Harmony, Ron Weasley and Brendan Glesson really stood out with some fine performances - especially from Brendan.The story also suffers, overly long, lacks imagination and is EXTREMELY predictable. With some awful stereotypes used - Irish will certainly find some particularly cringeworthy scenes.For kids this is great. If you are a fan of the series and/or a very young child then you will love this movie - be aware however that some of the scenes are a bit scary for some children.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Torn and Conflicted,"There were a lot of really great scenes in this movie, rather choppily stuck together, with much of the substance cut away, but a lot of good scenes.I think a lot was lost when the powers that be decided to fit this book into a 2.5 hour movie. I understand a lot of sub plots must be discarded when making a film adaptation of a book, but I think this went too far. No Ludo Bagman, no Winky, no Rita Skeeter nastiness, no Barty Crouch sneaking his son out of Azkaban.Also, Dumbledore's portrayal was HORRIBLE in this film...shaking Harry, filled with way too much energy, and having little humor or understanding with his students, as his character in the book does.A lot was missing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Simply Brilliant,"Those that read the book would understand how good the movie was. But, I have to say that Dumbledore doesn't have the charm he's supposed to have. I hate the guy playing Dumbledore. It's not that the actor did not do a good job, it's just he doesn't quite fut into the character. He doesn't have the serenity the kindness in his eyes as Dumbledore should have had. The first person to play the role of Dumbledore was perfect, but unfortunately he's not among us anymore. I feel that the person who played Gandalf(Ian McKellen) in LOTR would fit much better for the position of Dumbledore. But, overall the movie was excellent. The cast did an excellent job.

"Despite great pacing, fourth ""Potter"" loses a touch of magic","As a huge fan of the intelligence and beauty that Alfonso Cuaron brought to the third Harry Potter film based on J.K Rowling's fantasy book series, I was saddened to hear that he backed out of the fourth, ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"" because of the quick year and a half turnaround. Though director Mike Newell -- the series' first British director -- is no slouch, he doesn't fully capitalize on the potential of ""Goblet of Fire"" being such a departure from the previous novels and full of new characters.The book is cut down immensely, but it works. ""Goblet of Fire"" moves quickly but stays engaging and has plenty to offer in terms of action and special effects. Potter scribe Steve Kloves does his best work whittling the script down without compromise the key and most memorable parts of the story. In this installment, the much older mop-headed Harry Potter (Radcliffe, now on pubescent decline) is unwittingly selected as the fourth competitor in the Tri-Wizard tournament, a once-in-a-lifetime competition combining Hogwarts with two other magic schools: the boys of Durmstrang and the girls of Beauxbatons. New faces include Brendan Gleeson as MadEye Moody, the new teacher that aids Harry in figuring out tournament clues, Miranda Richardson as nosy reporter Rita Skeeter, ""Doctor Who"" star David Tennant as a follower of evil Lord Voldemort and Voldemort himself, finally appearing, fittingly played by Ralph Fiennes.An unfortunate side-effect of the condensed script is a slight sacrifice of character. The only actor who gets to take a notable step forward is Emma Watson as Hermione, who gets to play some of the more emotional scenes in the film, in fact she plays a role in just about every one of them. Newell stated this film was intended to shed the kids' goody two-shoes appearance and show them as more mischievous teenagers. While everyone else acts nasty, however, Hermione -- other than a few lines where she acts like a mother to Harry and Ron (Grint) is the exception. Watson's facial expressions -- where a smile sometimes slips in the face of danger or sadness -- is surprisingly candid.We honestly get little growth elsewhere in this film. Even Harry, who despite great acts of kindness in the story that put others ahead of his own would-be gains, doesn't appear to choose the actions so much as just do them because it's in the script. Newell could have been of more use here.Newell also seems to strip just a bit of the magic of seeing so much change to the Harry Potter world that this story brings. He keeps the more realistic street clothes element Cuaron emphasized, especially with the Tri-Wizard competitors wearing the equivalent of Nike for wizards, but every new element that ""Goblet of Fire"" introduces is sort of done so abruptly. We aren't teased with it or slowly shown its wonder. When we finally see the young adults from the other schools appear in the Great Hall, they do this campy show that hardly captures our imaginations. Even the awe of the Quidditch World Cup is cut short. Apparently we're to believe that a giant CG stadium with flashing lights happening very quickly is enough to scratch the itch of our imaginations. I would have gladly sat through another 10- 15 minutes for a bit more out of all these elements (most of which are in the first half hour).""Goblet of Fire"" is quick, entertaining fantasy -- a great adaption of a very lengthy book that is one of the series' most fun and adventurous. I don't quite understand the PG-13 rating, though there are certainly scarier elements as these books only get darker and darker. It simply would have been nice to see the maturity and intelligence that Cuaron brought to the series continued or pushed further.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Not the Best Installment,"Harry Potter number four can't be accused of being the best of the bunch, but it has its moments. The addition of Robert Pattinson as Cedric Diggory was good, a role he plays better than Edward in Twilight. And Brendan Gleeson as Professor Mad-Eye Moody was excellent.The closing minutes of the film are truly the best, frightening maybe, but the scene in the graveyard makes the movie. It's at this point in the series that you get the first glimpse of Voldemort in his true form.It's too bad that Robert Pattinson couldn't have continued in the Potter franchise, as it would have benefited him far more.

It goes rather fastly as to not make a five-hour-long movie, but none of that messes it up. The special effects, the actors' performances, the music, EVERYTHING makes this movie the best I've seen in many years. I insist that you convince everyone to go with you and watch the movie, even if you have to see it 20 times, it'll be worth it. And yes, Daniel does appear fully shirtless for about three minutes, girls, don't worry.

The Best Yet,"What a grand movie, and what a relief that the cinematic Goblet of Fire captured the spirit of the Potter books this time around! Unlike the screen version of Prisoner of Azkaban, this movie ""gets it"" with regard to what is and is not important. While almost all of the book's sub-plots had to be omitted, just about everything important made it into this film, even if the way it was included was altered slightly. The changes were believable and the none of the essential elements of the story were lost. I add my voice to those declaring Goblet of Fire by far the best of the Potter movies.I don't usually comment on special effects, but it would be a crime to ignore them in this case. I knew exactly what to expect from all the scariest parts of the movie, but even so, I was gasping and clutching my husband's hand during the dragon task and the graveyard scene. Amazing stuff. I had the advantage of seeing the movie in IMAX, and it felt like I was flying right along with Harry. If you have the opportunity to experience the film in IMAX, do it. It will be worth every penny. I really wanted to just buy another ticket and see it again, right then!Excellent acting all around...Madame Maxine was not quite what I had pictured, but she worked. The kids improve with every movie; Daniel Radcliffe was superb in the scene immediately following the graveyard experience. I wish that we could have seen a little more of him and explored a bit more deeply the emotions he portrayed so well. If I have one criticism, it would have to be with Michael Gambon's interpretation of Dumbledore. He seems overly harsh and dictatorial, and I don't see him building the rapport with Harry that the character requires. I almost wonder if he has read the books. He is adequate, but Dumbledore really needs to be exceptional.All in all, Goblet of Fire is a joy to watch. I plan to return to the theater at least once, and I'll certainly be adding the DVD to my collection. An absolute must-see for all Potter fans.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Getting to the darker side.,"Based on the book Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, this is the fourth film in the Harry Potter film trilogy, a story where Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts for his fourth year, getting himself participating in the Trizwizard tournament, his name having been picked out of the Goblet of Fire to take part in the challenge, even though he is under age. In addition to dealing with dragons, sea creatures and a terrifying maze, Harry must come face-to-face with the invading Dark Lord.Based on just the movie itself instead of comparing it with the book, the story takes on a more darker tone and tense drama as we see more of the Dark Lord and more of Harry's struggles as his past and his enemies torment him. I think the actors did an OK performance in this one, not very convincing or powerful as in the previous three films. At times, I even thought the acting was a little juvenile among Potter and his friends. I do, though, especially like the part where MadEye Moody (Brendan Gleeson) turns Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) into a rodent or some sort.The special effects were pretty good and the battle between Potter and the dragon and him getting zig-zagged in the maze were exciting. But overall, this is a slower-paced movie and not as captivating as the previous films.Grade C",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Best Potter Yet!!!

The special effects are outstanding, the actors have really grown into there respective characters. I will be going again this week on request by my 4 year old son, who also loved it.. He is a huge fan, and has been since he was freshly 2. I personally don't think it is dark, as the news is reporting, and find it acceptable for any HP fan, Adam fully understood what was going on. I highly recommend this film for anyone with an imagination.

"too much ""action""","I think this movie is too fast-paced. Magic and mystery have been sacrificed for pointless ""action"". Even Dumbledore is shown losing his nerve, which is totally contradictory to his character. Many things have been left unexplained, which must be quite confusing to those viewers who have not read the books. There is really nothing in the book that suggests that in this installment the pace of the action has to be stepped up like this. I always found that it is exactly the mysterious, dreamy atmosphere that held me spell-bound. Only very few scenes in this movie still have that quality, such as the one with Sirius talking through the hearth fire.This is still an enjoyable movie; however, it is really unfortunate that so many opportunities for making it less superficial have been missed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Masterpiece in its own World,"Well into ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"" Albus Dumbledore intones as only he can: ""Dark and difficult times lie ahead."" What does he think lay behind? In this adventure Harry will do battle with giant lizards, face the attack of the Death Eaters, and in perhaps the most difficult task of all for a 14-year-old, ask a girl to be his date at the Yule Ball.That Harry survives these challenges goes without saying, since in the world of print his next adventures have already been published, but ""Goblet of Fire"" provides trials that stretch his powers to the breaking point. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) was just turning 13 in the previous movie, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" (2004), and the Potter series turns PG-13 with this installment. Certainly Lord Voldemort seems capable of limitless villainy. Although we glimpsed his face in ""The Sorcerer's Stone,"" we see him in full on screen for the first time in ""Goblet of Fire,"" and he does not disappoint: Hairless, with the complexion of a slug, his nostrils snaky slits in his face, he's played by Ralph Fiennes as a vile creature who has at last been rejoined by his Death Eaters, who were disabled by Harry's magic earlier in the series. The film is more violent, less cute than the others, but the action is not the mindless destruction of a video game; it has purpose, shape and style, as in the Triwizard Tournament, which begins the film. Three finalists are chosen by the Goblet of Fire, and then the Goblet spits out an unprecedented fourth name: Harry Potter's. This is against the rules, since you have to be 17 to compete in Triwizardry, and Harry is only 14, but Dumbledore's hands are tied: What the Goblet wants, the Goblet gets. The question is, who entered Harry's name, since Harry says he didn't? Uch varied notes serve him well in ""Goblet,"" which explores a wide emotional range. He balances delicately between whimsy and the ominous, on the uncertain middle ground where Harry lives, poised between fun at school, teenage romance and the dark abyss.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Could it have been made differently?,"Having seen The Goblet of Fire twice now, and enjoyed and thought much of it by the way, I am having disappointing thoughts that, firstly, a film of this length is not allowed an intermission of perhaps five minutes as was given in lengthy films in the past. The experience became a marathon for my bladder and bottom near the end and actually drew my attention away from the experience I was supposed to be having. Secondly, I am now convinced that the book, being so lengthy, should have been turned into two films, the second perhaps released a month after the first. That's not been done before? So what? The series is so ground-breaking anyway that not much speculation would have been needed for it to succeed. Because, amongst my general satisfaction overall for the film, I was nevertheless disappointed that so much was omitted from the book. However...as much as I enjoyed it, I am beginning to see the series as a vehicle (not a showcase) for our well-known British actors who seem to be 'jumping on the bandwagon' of its roller coaster and much deserved success I may add. These inclusions of famous faces, to me, draw attention away and prevent me from becoming completely immersed into the story. Perhaps its an age thing but I would have liked to have seen more unknowns in it, ones with no associations from previous films. One further complication as viewed through my speculative eyes is that it has become 'darker' as almost everybody has noticed. In my view and from a children's book point of view, this diversion from the original shows a lack of imagination and creation and furthermore, I believe, reflects the problems we are having in our present day societies. Therefore, this then becomes less of a fantasy which could be described as groundbreaking and a modern classic, and more about an author's unrealised fears. I think the film took itself too seriously. It is plain to me where JK Rowland is going. Beware Ron Weasley! Molly Cutpurse www.mollycutpurse.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
why... why... WHYY!!!,"First of all... WHY!!!Secondly I found this movie to be a great disappointment. I just don't know where to begin. So lets start from the beginning shall we?first there was a harry potter book series written by J.K Rowling that was good, children and adults all over the word rejoiced. Then in comes Hollywood and says: Hi we want to make movies about this ""Harry Potter"" we have heard so much about. And Rowling is flattered to no end and says yes.First movie: great to see Harry potter on the big screen, all right movieSecond movie: begins to get darker, you love it, I love it, we all love it.Third movie: SLAM DUNK. They followed the plot of the book and made some ""changes"" for example casual clothing after school hours that just makes it feel so much more alive.And now we have *drums* Number four: WHAT THE *BLEEP*, although I must admit I cried... allot! From the beginning to the bitter end! it was horrid, it almost felt like Hollywood was taking a big dump right on my copy of the book. I have a feeling that the chaps in Hollywood said: - Read! READ!? You want US to actually READ the book before we make a movie!? Preposterous!at the beginning of the movie i just sat there with an uneasy feeling in my stomach because everything was going waaay to fast. and the usual ""slow start"" was no where to be seen. They just jumped right into all of it. Then what was up with that ridicules entrance into the great hall! I almost puked right there. And some of the later action sequences like 1st task WAY to overblown, in the book Harry just breezed trough it.but okay I can almost of forgive that, after all it IS Hollywood. But what I can't forgive is the Butchering of Characters in this movie! And the victims are:Dumbledore: in the book he's the calm, somewhat silly rock that hogwarts rests upon, in this movie he's well lets say not that calm. He shouts, grabs, maybe even pinches and bites. and I can't shake thee feeling that he is a mean drunk some of the time.And then Krum... ooh poor krum, he became the teen movie Jock. in the book he is insecure, somewhat frail, clumsy on the ground, quite intelligent and ugly. in the movie he has an Kelvin kline model with an ego the size of Hagrid and so stupid Crab and Goyle seems like Einstein in comparison.AND there is not even a whisper about fleur being 1/4 veela. I mean COMMON! How hard can it be to fit that in!just to name the biggest.The thing this movie lacks that number three is filled with is: Soul, character interaction, character building, and sense of details.So if you want to see some kind of cool action scenes, and special effects for 308 000 000 dollars, be my guest. But if you want Harry potter. take a cup of coco, a blanket, light a fire and read the book. because this ladies and gentlemen is NOT Harry potter!",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Dumbledore said camly,"When it comes to these movies, I don't usually compare to the books that much. Most of the Harry Potter films aren't too bad at being good adaptions while also being good stand alone films. But when it comes to Goblet of Fire, I prefer the book way too much to fully enjoy it. We're at the part of the series where books tend to be much thicker to allow the movies to be perfectly adapted. Goblet of Fire did it's best, and is still a decent movie. But like I said, the book is superior.We've entered the era of post Columbus & Williams, but that doesn't mean cast & crew faltered. We still had David Heyman, Stuart Craig, and Steve Kloves at the helm. Mike Newell and Patrick Doyle did okay as Director and Composer. As for cast, all the actors portraying those from Durmstrang & Beaxubatons were good, including Frances de la Tour and Predrag Bjelac as Maxime & Karkaroff. This film introduced Katie Leung as Cho Chang and also provided one time appearances to Robert Pattinson, David Tennant, and Roger Lloyd Pack as Cedric and the Barty Crouches. The two best cast additions definitely had to be Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes. Gleeson's portrayal of Madeye Moody is exactly how I always imagined it in the books. And the legendary Fiennes must be one of the greatest casting decisions made in the series because he just owns every scene Voldemort is in.Despite little flaws here & there, the Triwizard Tournament was fun to watch. That's one thing they did perfectly, I just wish the schools and the champions had more time to be fleshed out. It also would've been cool to spend more time at the Quidditch World Cup. Not just for the Quidditch but also for the Wizarding cultures from around the world. This is also the first movie where we see a sore absence of the general ghost population floating around Hogwarts.I loved the Yule Ball scene. I do listen to the Weird Sisters songs from time to time. Hermione coming down the stairs in her gown has to be one of the character's most iconic moments. The whole final act is superb. From Voldemort's resurrection to the credits, no matter how you feel about the rest of the movie, this final act is truly a highlight, not just the movie but the entire series.While it may not be my favorite, it's definitely the one I think I quote the most. ""I'm not an owl,"" ""Is that a student?"", ""That's my son! That's my boy!"", ""I can touch you now!"" Man, all the memes from this movie! And Harry Potter fans will never ever ever forget when Dumbledore asked Harry ""Did you put you name in the goblet of fire"" calmly.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Good, but they missed so much","In general, it's a fine addition to the franchise, but the characters were tradgically misperformed.

The One Who Must Not Be Named,"The fourth Harry Potter movie that also advances the global plot, but otherwise unchanged. I'll be honest, I had a hard time giving it an 8 out of 10 since it doesn't feel all that unique, but there's one reason it deserves this grade.The production, as usual, is good. Of the new stuff, I can single out the spectacle of what's going on. This movie is very memorable with different moments that you remember very well even from childhood. That's why it deserves 8 out of 10.But there is always something to say but. I wouldn't say there's anything particularly new here. There is no obvious character development here, only questions to the character of a certain character causing some irritation and misunderstanding.Watching this movie as a kid, I was terribly afraid of one particular fragment, which is now perceived normally. Some moments were also scary, but not so much that it was like a screamer appeared on the screen. So, it's a good movie that will be remembered.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
My brief review of the film,"While 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'Return of the Jedi' are both generally regarded as good films, ''Empire'' is generally considered to be vastly superior for taking the series in new directions while ''Jedi'' just provided more of the same. I feel that this type of relationship can be applied to this Harry Potter film and the third entry, directed by Alfonso Cuarón. The third film gave a whole new darker and more adult look to the series with a considerable amount of style. This fourth film carries on that style but fails to improve on it; as the director, Mike Newell does not add any touches that are distinctly his own. That's not to say that it is a poor film. It is well made, with excellent makeup, superb interior decoration and special effects that are as impressive as usual, but it is in no way up to the standard of the third film. The new music by Patrick Doyle is quite good also, in the same style as John William's famed composition, but with sensations of its own. The film still does have its flaws, and those who have read the book have also complained about it being the first poor adaptation in the series. It is not too well written either way, with too many love subplots that add up to nothing by the end. The plot also feels rather reduced to just sporting events. Directing-wise, the film often feels too busy, with much of the action looking like it is just for show, and although the cinematography is epic scale and grand, it tends to make the film feel too much like a roller coaster ride. It is yet again reasonably entertaining and engaging to watch, despite its drawbacks and its extreme length. It is full of parts that are amusing and interesting effects. It simply just is not too praiseworthy as a follow-up to the superb 'Harry Potter and the Prison of the Azkaban'.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, directed by Mike Newell, is one of the most entertaining installments of the saga, but had a tough time finding it's place. Right off the bat, I didn't like the idea of him directing this film because, he was too lazy to watch the other Harry Potter films, or to even read The Goblet of Fire. Mike Newell brings his own style to the film, which is completely fine, but his execution fell short, feeling like he was working against the former directors, instead of working with them.Mike Newell finds a way to incorporate a few decent ideas, with a handful of entertaining sequences, and great stakes, but the film as a whole, feels unconnected, with a lot of unnecessary filler, and subplots, that doesn't offer a whole lot to the film or saga, and could've easily been cut to develop more important events. On more than a few occasions, Newell started to craft a decent idea, and then he'll bail on it, and it became quite annoying. The pacing moves pretty fast through everything, leaving some things underdeveloped, and not that interesting, at times. The tones of the film play along the same lines as Prisoner of Azkaban, but turning up the darkness and comedy a level or two. The tones were fine for the most part, but Newell wanted this to be more of a comedy than all the others, and it feels forceful at times.Although this is still a story-based narrative, the characters had a lot to do. There was some nice moments from our returning supportive characters, while there was great tention from our three returning leads. There was a lot of nice maturing aspects to our leads, but it throws off the focus of the film, making it feel like two different films at times. Although there were some decent character moments with our returning characters, the abundance of new additions were almost completely disposable! There were a select few that belong in the narrative, but eighty percent of them have about two lines of dialogue, being utterly underutilized.The screenplay by Steve Kloves had a lot of standout moments! He incorporated a lot of mature themes and messages, beautifully delivered by the cast! The issues with the screenplay, is the inconsistencies, and imbalances, due to an overstuffed narrative.The production of this film looks great! The creative team used a lot of beautifully detailed set pieces, to really make the scenes pop! The cinematography looks fantastic, utilizing a lot of blues and greens, to really set the tone.The Goblet of Fire really brings the magic element to new heights! With there being so many memorable action and magic sequences, the creative team still managed to balance it well, so it doesn't over saturate the message and themes they were going for. The effects also look phenomenal, still holding up til this day! It's a pleasure to be able to witness the big steps they take with each film, and seeing them come into their own.Overall, if I had a favorites list, Goblet of Fire is definitely in my top 3, but due to a lot inconsistencies, it's hard not to keep this one out of the bottom three.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Full of subtleties and adolescent angst,"For the longest time this was my least favorite film in the Harry Potter franchise, but now I realize that was just my own projected insecurity.This film is AWKWARD. It makes you cringe. But that is why it is brilliant. The adolescent angst twists through the entire movie and lends the film both atmosphere and consistency.The subtle nods to adolescent are too many to list fully. Note Harry's interactions with the big man on campus, Cedric. Wince as both Harry and Ron struggle (and fail!) to find the right words to express the confused turmoil of their emotions. You want to reach out to the screen and slap the both of them. They come across as rather pathetic, but in a very realistic way, and if all that discomfort makes the movie hard for you to watch, then perhaps you should recognize the richness of a film that manages to dig up your own social trauma, embarrassing moments, and all those times you had your own foot in your mouth.McGonagall and Hagrid, and the Weasley twins, are treats in this movie. I don't usually like Hagrid but his scenes with his large love interest are hilarious.Goblet of Fire was the first of the ""larger"" harry potter books, and the filmmakers had a lot of plot to cram in. The movie does feel rushed and episodic at the start. The scene with Sirius Black on the fireplace is shoe-horned in. But this is more than made up for with the pageantry and intensity of the Tri-Wizard tournament.In the end, this is perhaps the richest Harry Potter movie, with the exception of the Half Blood Prince, and it is perhaps the most successful of the series in immersing you in the reality of a fantasy world.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Change!,"This is where the series drastically changes and takes a drastic turn, as the poster ""Everything's about to change"", says.And that is true, everything changed here.This movie's maze scene was literally the best.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
There was so much to like about this film.,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005) is a movie I recently watched with my daughter on HBOMAX. In this storyline Harry starts the school year under new circumstances as other schools like his, but unique in their own way, have arrived to play a game. The best magician of each school is selected to participate in the game, and despite not being old enough to play, and being outside the game rules, somehow Harry is selected to participate in the game as well. These games put students, not only the participants, lives at risk, and not everyone will survive. Meanwhile the evil that was at the end of the previous movie is coming closer and closer to exposing itself.This movie is directed by Mike Newell (Donnie Brasco) and stars
Daniel Radcliffe (Horns), Emma Watson (Beauty and the Beast), Timothy Spall (Sweeney Todd), Robert Pattinson (The Batman), Jason Isaacs (Black Hawk Down), Tom Felton (Rise of the Planet of the Apes), Ralph Fiennes (Schindler's List) and Alan Rickman (Die Hard).The storyline for this is fantastic with dark and threatening elements, much like the previous film. The opening game of quidditch depicted like a soccer match was fun. I also really enjoyed the dance and every scene in the game, especially the dragon, under water scene and the maze. The new characters were well cast and executed and very entertaining. The depiction of teenage love and friendships was well written and presented. There was so much to like about this film.Overall this is a very well done picture that is an absolute must see. I would score this a solid 9-9.5/10 and strongly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A one off watch maybe....,"I'd have to say, if you haven't read the book don't go and see it. It misses out so many crucial details that if you don't already know the story you will be completely lost and confused. New characters that are prominent in the book are given their own scene to be set up in honour of the original story but only appear for about 5 seconds in the rest of the film (Rita Skeeter as an example).As in all the other Harry Potter films there are some incredibly cheesy lines that are cringe worthy and you feel really sorry for the actors who have to say them. The filmmakers should really have spent more time developing the characters of the actors who can actually act. Alan Rickman is sorely under-used, as is Robbie Coltrane and I don't think I even saw Julie Walters!But after all that it is quite fun. Complete mindless tosh but it has some good lines. If you're a die-hard Harry Potter fan you may be disappointed because (unsurprisingly) there are many character and plot cuts, but if (like me) you think Potter is just a fun story, and not particularly a good book, then you'll have a laugh. Nothing too intellectually challenging or hard. But not a film you'd want to watch twice!",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was excellent,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was by far the best movie I have seen in an extremely long time. The performances were extraordinary and moving. Not having read the book first and just seeing the movies, I have to say that Goblet of Fire was the best out of all the Harry Potter movies. It made me laugh, it made my cry, but most of all it made me intrigued. I enjoyed the movie very much, and I'm not speaking as a fanatic of the series, but as movie goer who enjoys watching generally good movies. I gave the movie a ten because I believe it deserved a ten. It was amazing: the special effects were awesome and the acting didn't seem like that of young actors and actresses, but of experienced and talented artists. I enjoyed the movie very much and I recommend it to everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the best movies ever!,"This is definitely the best movie. Not just out of all three Harry Potters, but one of the best movies I have seen. It is good because not only are the actors better and more skilled at acting, but they are starting to become actual good at acting their parts. Not that they weren't before, but they are a lot better at it now. It was sad at many parts and I admit that I did cry. It was scary as well to see Lord Voldemort and his evilness being brought upon Harry. It was very funny as well, the funniest one yet. It was interesting to see the characters starting to like other girls and boys. It added to the all around goodness of the movie. Although it wasn't exactly like the book and they left out many parts and altered others, it was still very good. Try not to be disappointed, those of you who like the book to be exactly like the movie. But if you have never read the book, you would be puzzled and you would be even more puzzled if you hadn't seen the other movies. I overall think that this was one of my all time favorites and I can't wait to see it again. It is a must see to many people.

"Funniest, most exciting, most emotional and most frightening Potter instalment yet","What's more frightening? Tackling a fire-breathing dragon or asking someone out on a date? Yet another improvement on its predecessors, Goblet of Fire is the funniest, most exciting, most emotional and most frightening Potter instalment yet. Radcliffe, Watson and Grint deliver their best performances thus far, showing a firm grip of the much darker and more emotionally challenging material here. Newell and Kloves ensure that the powerful material contained within its complex storyline is never lost; but they also manage to perfectly capture the angst and insecurity suffered by our adolescent heroes with a wicked sense of humour.The ever-expanding ensemble are at the top of their game here, with top-notch performances from Tennant, Pack, Gleeson and Pattinson (I know, right?). But stealing the show has to be the Dark Lord himself, as Fiennes - with a little help from the CGI team - delivers a turn as Voldemort that marks a definitive transformation to the series. It's gonna be a rough ride from here on out.Compressing a 600-page book into a film less than three hours long is never going to be easy, so the most faithful readers may not be totally satisfied with the absence of some material. For the rest, Goblet of Fire is simply awesome.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Amazing,"I think that Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire its the best of all Harry Potter movie...in this one I really believe the acting of Dan Radcliffe...he made me cry...but not just Dan Radcliffe...also Emma Watson was amazing, and Rupert Grint he was really was good... and Mike Newell really put some British aroma to this movie...I hope that the next HArry Potter movie, it'll be good as this one. But what I most like in the other three movies was the original score from John Williams...and in this one its kind of like boring...just some music... but that doesn't make it a bad score.

I don't know...,"I knew from the beginning that my standards were too high because I knew there was a ton of things they had to cover, but I didn't think the movie would miss par by THAT much. First of all, many scenes were jumpy and I didn't know what was going on. Basically, if you haven't read the book, good luck in figuring out what happened in some parts. Even though I read the book I still had trouble following the story. Second, it seemed like the movie missed crucial parts of the book, and instead inserted pointless dialogue and unnecessary comments. Many scenes left me thinking, ""...What?!?"" Third, it seemed like the director was more focused on graphics rather than the plot itself. Again, there were many unnecessary things that the movie didn't need. I was also looking forward to quidditch and the tournament, and was VERY disappointed. In collusion, I did think this movie was okay for all the information that needed to be covered. Other things in the movie: The boys need to cut their hair. The style in this movie is much different (it is a different director) and I preferred the last director. Also Dumbledore, to me, came off as rather rude and rough, COMPLETELY different from what he should be. That is all.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Unsatisified but entertained,"As many fans of Harry Potter did, I flocked to the theatre tonight to see the newest in the Harry Potter collection. In attendance with me was another person well versed in the Harry Potter lore and someone who had never read the books. The un-read friend found the movie slow and floundering, as we, the well read, did. She found herself dozing and yearning for more of the Harry-Hermione-Ron interactions that this film lacked.The well-read attendee and I felt that the movie was rushed. Fully realizing that a book that is as long as Goblet of Fire is cannot contain all of the fun and enjoyable plot points, many of the points that were included dragged the movie down. I would prefer to see a movie that stays true to the overall theme of the book rather than a movie that forces a story together and shouts ""I hope you like what we did, we sure tried to get everything.""I left the theatre desiring to read the book again to regain the enjoyment I had and the anxiety I felt about the friendship and the tournament. Although there is no good place in the story to create a split, I would have preferred to have seen this movie split up into 2 films to get everything, rather than what Mike Newell and company forced together.However, despite what I wrote, I did enjoy the film but do suggest that you be prepared for a long film and not be tired. I will try again at an earlier showing and hope to leave feeling better about the latest tribute to Harry Potter!",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Rushed but still a great movie,"It is hard for me to judge the quality of a Harry Potter movie. Simply because I am in love with the book series. For me watching the Harry Potter movies are like reading very entertaining spark notes. They are there simply to remind me of the world of Harry Potter. This is not saying that they are horrible. In fact the movies are a great sample of the magic of HP. Having said that the fourth movie is no exception. It does a great job bringing to life the events of the Goblet of Fire and for the most part the emotions as well. However, it is difficult to squeeze a 734 or so page book into a 2-hour and a half movie. It just can't be done. Some of the characters as well as a large amount of the beginning chapters had to be cut out strictly for the sake of time. The first 30 minutes of the movie fly by and I remember sitting in the theater praying for the pace to slow down. Luckily it did, and once everyone in the theater took a breath, we were all able to start enjoying the movie. Not to expose too much of the movie and to let you make your own judgments I will end this review here saying that if you are a fan of the book series then I would strongly recommend you see it, you will not be disappointed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Voldemort comes to power,This movie is the most emotional movie in the harry potter series,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"The darkest, deepest and most emotionally involving film of the series so far.","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is not only the most technologically advanced of the Potter films thus far, but also the most entertaining. Director Mike Newell (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Donnie Brasco) is careful with the structure of his film, and keeps the pace moving steadily along. He balances CGI animation (such as a breathtaking underwater sequence) with tender emotional moments involving broken friendships and broken hearts. I did not like the first three Harry Potter films, yet I found this one to be a rather pleasant surprise.Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) returns once again to Hogwarts' School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, under the care of Dumbledore (Michael Gambon), Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) and Minerva (Maggie Smith), teachers and advisers. His friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermoine Granger (Emma Watson) are soon in his company and all appears to be well and fine for him.However, dark times lie ahead for Harry Potter. His name is mysteriously entered into the Triwizard Tournament  a test of strength and perseverance open only to those seventeen years of age and older. Harry is selected to compete despite being a minor by three years, much to the confusion and fury of fellow classmates and school faculty.Reluctant, his first battle is with a dragon in an arena, and it only gets worse from there onwards. Soon it is made clear that there is a dark conspiracy centering on Harry's involvement in the competition and it may be linked to the dreaded Lord Voldemort, who killed Harry's parents years prior and caused the lightning bolt scar on his forehead.What I was most startled by with Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was its emotional complexity. Despite a few flaws (particularly in length, clocking in at 157 minutes), Newell concentrates on what the earlier films lacked  depth. Sure, they might have been fairly whimsical and unique, but the characters were given little to do. Here, a good amount of the time is actually spent focusing on the characters rather than the action  friendship tensions between Ron and Harry, for example, as well as Harry's confrontation with his parents' murderer, Lord Voldemort (taking form in the hideous guise of a disfigured Ralph Fiennes).The scary moments are effective. I still think Chamber of Secrets was the darkest from a technical standpoint (there are brighter colors used here and less blue filters) but when it's dark, it's DARK. The maze sequence towards the end of the picture would be enough to give the kiddies nightmares for weeks - this segment alone probably contributed heavily to the movie's PG-13 rating. (The first film of the series to be rated higher than PG.) Is this the best Harry Potter movie? Simply put, yes. It is the most entertaining, the darkest and the most emotionally intriguing film of the series. If they continue at this pace of improvement, the next entry  The Order of the Phoenix  could be a very good film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"It was all a let down, save for Neville","Despite the fact that the third Harry Potter movie was deeply disappointing, I was going to give this one a chance. There was a new director, so I was not going to judge without seeing the movie. One look at the trailers and I figured, this movie ought to be pretty good. I was proved more than wrong.Based on the choppy scenes with no genuine transitions and lack of continuity, the movie itself seemed like one big trailer that would be promoting the ""real film."" I find it hard to believe that anyone who had not read the books could follow along in the beginning at all. I was very let down within the first ten minutes of the movie. At least the last one was able to keep me happy for half an hour. The only reason I continued watching was because I paid 6.50 for my ticket and I figured they could not butcher it more than they already had.I knew from the first scene that they had gone and rewritten it again when I saw the ""third"" man in the room with Voldemort and Wormtail. I knew straight away what they had done and that by placing Barty Crouch Junior in the room they would be able to magically write out the house elves. That is the moment that I knew they ruined what makes the Harry Potter series so great, the mystery. In the first ten minutes they managed to write out all of the mystery, which is what makes the books worth reading. Harry was never supposed to prematurely know that Crouch Junior was alive, that is half of the shock at the end of the book. The movies without that mystery turn into cheap fantasy thrillers with a bit of teenage drama.The beginning is probably one of the main reasons I intensely dislike this movie. Then what angered me further was the unnecessary scenes that were lengthened or inserted into the movie for ""action."" For example, the chase scene with the dragon which lasted a good seven or eight minutes long could have been taken out for its useless (intended to be) climax of action. In the book, Harry never left the arena and that scene in the movie was completely ridiculous with them climbing on the roof of the castle. Then there was the scene when the other schools arrived and there was like a five minute show they put on that was completely meaningless. It was like a circus performance and had nothing to do with the plot whatsoever. They could have kept the dragon scene like it is in the book and took out the little performances by the other schools and then done a little more work on the beginning and end. The end more so because they left out parts integral to the next book.They failed to have Dumbledore explain what exactly Prior Incantatem was and why Voldemort and Harry's wands failed to work against one another. It was also never stated that the ministry refuses to believe that Voldemort is back, and that is the most important information because the entire fifth book is based around the fact that almost no one believes Harry that Voldemort is back. Although not as major as the last bit of ""forgotten"" information, they also left out how Dumbledore was rallying old friends to start fighting against Voldemort, the triwizard winnings and how Harry gave them to Fred and George, and they even left loose ends. They began the Rita Skeeter story line but they never concluded it, they just stopped mentioning or showing her halfway through the movie. I'm sure they did such a cut for time, but Rita skeeter plays a roll in the next book when Harry tries to convince the wizarding world of the truth. Now all of that is only most of the reasons I hated it. If anyone wishes to discuss further or ask more detailed questions you can e-mail me at padfoot_3@yahoo.com.There was one thing I DID enjoy in the movie and that was Neville. Everything else was absolutely dreadful whether it was the acting, the writing, or the cuts, but Neville I loved. In fact I like his character more than I used to due to this movie. Ron was my favorite character (in the books) but now he is tied for first with poor Neville. I am also saddened that most of the real Harry Potter comedy is written out of the movies and they insert corny movie comedy. All the comedy the story needs is in Fred and George and they always leave any of their scenes on the cutting room floor. Or maybe they don't even consider including them.As a Harry Potter fan and a moviegoer, this movie was atrocious and I will never recommend watching this movie. It was a waste of time that could have been put to better use. If anyone does feel compelled to watch it I suggest not paying to see it, borrow it from the library and fast forward over all parts except any scene in which Neville plays a part (which is only about five scenes). I will reiterate how tragic Neville always seems and this makes him more likable.I would just like to say that as a person who never watches football and has never liked it, I would have spent my time better had I watched the Ohio State vs. Michigan game instead.To anyone who e-mails me, I will gladly reply.

Great Movie,"OK, I'm a fan of the Harry Potter series. The first three movies, I thought were pretty good. When I went to the Goblet of fire, I was amazed. You will hear from a lot of people, that they left a lot of the book out, which is understandable, considering that the book was 900 pages long. If they put every little detail in, the movie would have been 4+ hours, which is a very long time at the movie theater. But don't worry, the extended addition will add a lot more to the movie, so that the die-hard Harry Potter fans will be happy. The movie was more intense, which made a lot better. They showed a good bit of all of the important stuff, such as the Triwizard tournament. He who must not be named. LOL. The Rita Skeeter drama. So on, and so forth.

hogwarts,Living near the Hogwart's castle/school makes watching a Harry Potter film that much more interesting. I really like the compactness of this film--- i think that it was great to condense the book instead of rendering every bit of it--- that is best left for reading methinks. I have been engaged in conversation(s) with people who very intensely love the Potter--- they tell me things that happen in the books and the background of every character--- I have yet to read one word of it but have been piecing things together from the collaborative voice of my friends--- I have decided to stay away from the books for now--- hoping to escape the prison that I see people engaged in (aka) waiting for the 'next' book---- I admit that the films are staying good if not--- getting better---,,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
gOF,"GOF left out the things about HP that make it great- that's the real problem- Hollywood always makes sacrifices but this seemed more like a theme ride than a thoughtful, dark representation of the book. It did seem rushed from one action sequence to the next and all of the details that make the world of HP come alive for a reader were missing from the film- mostly. It isn't possible to duplicate a book in a film but this didn't even try- it used SFX instead of plot and character dev- shame.

The plot is about the Triwizard tournament, where each school's representative battled for the glory.

This is the first one that kept my interest throughout. Again, there were more unique wizard stuff that further expanded the universe. This was always fun to watch, and this movie still kept that tradition going.The first half actually was teen drama where the students went to a ball. The romance was more prominent, and even became naughty in some scenes. What drove the plot was the tournament, and the looming danger that hid beneath it throughout the runtime.When the imminent doom hit at around the last round of the tournament, the movie became vastly more intense. For the first time, I felt that Harry's life was in actual danger.As for problems, the runtime was still a tad bit long. Also, some of the rounds in the tournament were pretty weak an could have been more fun.Overall, this movie is where the main story actually starts. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Great tournament action,"This is the fourth in the Harry Potter franchise, and it's under new management once again. This time the director is Mike Newell who did 'Four Weddings and a Funeral'. There is a lot of material to stuff into this one. One of the problem is that the books are getting thicker and thicker. The fourth book is almost three times as long as the first book. A lot of it seems rushed and skipped over.Lord Voldemort supporters called 'Death Eaters' are bolder than ever. They disrupt the Quidditch World Cup Final. When school restarts, Hogwarts holds the Triwizard Tournament pitting three schools against each other.The tournament action is compelling and exciting. That's the heart of this movie. There is more teenage love drama. It's awkward and not in an appealing way. And Ron is downright bipolar in this one. There is a lot of awkward acting going on. It is extremely distressing. I feel whiplashed by the emotional 180s. There are also a lot of side stories trying to be crammed into this.

The 4th movie of the Harry Potter franchise is great,"The 4th movie is pivotal for the franchise - we finally get to see He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named return to power and pose a new level of threat for everyone. From this moment, we're shifted into a new, more sinister, and darker story where death, torture, and mischief of the evil kind are in play - quite a contrasting visual from the first movie where we're merely introduced to the world of magic though the gaze of an innocent young boy. The third movie only did that by painting Sirius Black as an escaped convict with only evil on his mind but now it's part of the real world, part of the main story.The cast in this movie was splendid - not only did we get to see two actors who would meet up on In Bruges (2008) later but we also have David Tennant, who I just want to see in more villain roles now. His screen time might of been brief but he was just a crazy menace all the time and I loved his performance in particular.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A Very Good Movie  ....... BUT,"A Very Good Movie the effect are really really great and u will sit in the edge of your seat for 2 and a half hour ....... BUT where is Dementors thats the most thing that interests me any why the hell Dumbledore was going to kill harry potter when he asked him if he had put his name in the goblet of fire and Farid & George said ""RUBBISH THATS RUBBISH"" that i thought that they didn't fear Dumbledore and the only thing that really i hated it that what happened to Barty Crouch????Harry saw him and went to see Dumbledore and nothing happened even they didn't talk about him and WHERE IS LODO BAGMAN !!!!!!!!!!!!I HOPE THEIR WILL BE DIRECTOR'S CUT VERSION AND I HOPE THAT IT WILL BE NOT 3 HOURS BUT 7 HOURS BECAUSE THE MOVIE WORTH YOUR MONEYAND WAIT FOR KING KONG OF COURSE",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
very well made but the adaptation inaccurate are a little disappointing,"The fourth offering in the Harry Potter franchise sees The Boy Who Lived and his chums trying to get through another year at the increasingly dangerous Hogwarts School Of Witchcraft And Wizardry. This means, as ever, secrets and treachery within, hostilities with classmates and life-threatening magical sports days. New to the mix is the embarrassing reality of tortured adolescence, with sexual awakenings and brooding mood-swings exacerbated by the added distraction of glamorous foreign exchange students. Making quite the grand entrance are the chic girls of Beauxbatons Academy and the hunky boys of Durmstrang Institute. Welcome to Harry Potter And The Rampaging Hormones.This is certainly not a movie for young children, however engaging its characters and comic touches. Teen angst and relationship problems are pretty boring if you're six. But it's not the burgeoning sexuality that's landed the picture its 12A certificate, rather its genuinely darker vein of fantasy horror. For the maturing Potter core audience this is well-developed, with teasing terrors and skin-crawling set-pieces as the dark Lord Voldemort rises again  as all dark lords must, it seems, DLs notoriously being even harder to kill totally dead than the nut-job in Halloween. (Quite why Lord V. is so preoccupied with plotting against the promising pipsqueak Harry is presumably something to be clarified for cinema audiences in the fullness of time.)Mike Newell, as the first British director entrusted with a series entry, oversees plenty of spiffing special-effects action  the Quidditch World Cup final, a dragon fight, an underwater sequence and Gary Oldman's (all-too-brief) fiery apparition  but as one would expect, he does a good job with the more personal, realistic emotional content, bringing on the young leads' performances noticeably in the process. So it's a shame that he's less successful in handling the necessary novel-to-screen compression.Even though Newell's adaptation runs to more than two-and-a-half hours, the book is such a doorstopper that screenwriter Steve Kloves had to ditch more material this time around. Harry's annual confinement with his ghastly Dursley relations and Hermione's house-elf-liberation campaign is gone. While he was at it, it's a pity he didn't also delete tabloid hackette Rita Skeeter  however much one likes Miranda Richardson  since she obviously functions as author J. K. Rowling's dig at celebrity-stalking gossips, adding nothing more than running-time the story doesn't need.As it is, there's too much contrasting material with which to contend: the life-or-death challenges of the Triwizard competition are interspersed with a host of new characters and their sinister or serio-comic sub-plots, school lessons, the agenda of yet another eccentric new Defence Against The Dark Arts professor in Brendan Gleeson's fierce Mad-Eye Moody, Potter sidekick Ron's sulks, swotty Hermione's makeover and Harry's blushing attempts to ask a girl to a danceConsequently, the story editing goes through some distinctly choppy patches. It looks as if several scenes were filmed at greater length, surviving in quick snippets that are frequently unnecessary. The movie Newell set out to make  eccentric comedy-cum-Hitchcockian conspiracy  can only be glimpsed briefly, before that beast of a plot charges back into shot, demanding attention.Thankfully, most of it is pulled together towards the end. It's no secret that Ralph Fiennes handles the long-awaited appearance of evil Voldemort himself, and thankfully his big scene is sensationally creepy, ensuring strong anticipation for frights to come.

Fantastic movie but the book even greater,"I really enjoyed this movie. It had fantastic effects, very good plot and a breathtaking ending battle (between Harry and Voldemort). Also it had many funny scenes and characters that are more mature than the previous films. Although it was a great film, I was disappointed by the fact that many elements included in the book , were cut in the movie. I'm sure that this was necessary so that the film wouldn't last more than 3 hours, but I would like to see , for example, how Harry's opponents ,in the triwizard tournament, dealt with their dragons . However, I strongly recommend the film to all of those who have watched Harry's previous films and like the magic that each film brings.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Funny, Dark, and Good","Wow, Harry and the gang are growing up. Adults and kids, Potter-philes or not, will love this movie because this is actually a good movie. Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson are developing into good actors, possibly because of the addition of great talents to the Potter troupe, like Gary Oldman, Ralph Finnes, and Brendan Gleeson. Newell's directing is top rate and the special effects are seamless. I actually noticed the sound in this film being something that obviously enhanced the movie.There is a ineffable quality here that makes this the best Potter movie thus far, and a movie that sets the bar high for the holiday releases. Maybe it is the story (as the 4th book is considered the best) or maybe this one has benefited from the obvious purism of Columbus and the edginess of Cuaron, ""Goblet"" is a blend of both.There will be those who want more and complain about what was left out. (Like the 12 year old who exited ""Return of the King"" complaining about what was left out of the 3.5 hour movie.) However, the story is represented very well. I had a hard time remembering what parts weren't told. Sure, I wanted to see a ""Blast-ended skrewt"" and a fuller version of the events occurring at the Quiddich World cup, but this movie is 2 hours and 20 minutes and does the job it is asked to do. Besides, maybe in 20 or so years someone will make a TV mini-series out of it and cover everything in the book.I don't necessarily agree with the PG-13 rating (when the rating was first introduced it was called a ""soft-R""). Admittedly, the humor is a bit more grown-up, worrying about getting a date, and how one is dressed, but not too saucy, and Grint's mantra of ""Bloody Hell"" could be seen as offensive, but nothing that should be considered salacious. The ""darker images"" mentioned have a nightmarish quality to them, but then that pretty much stays with the story. I would not recommend this for kids under 7. My 8 year old enjoyed it and was on the edge of her seat, but she was never hiding her face or clinging to me for protection.Overall, this is a superior movie. It goes beyond my classification of a ""fun movie"", which is one that you over-look the obvious flaws because it is fun to watch. You care about these characters and identify with them, and find yourself wishing you could stay in their world for a while longer.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Sack the screenwriter!,"I have just back from seeing this. Right now, I should be doing something more important, but I had to put this down before my head explodes! I really, honestly do not know what to say about this film. It's beautifully made, yes. The acting is much improved, yes. But the unbelievable liberties that were taken - what are you meant to say about that? From the off, Harry's dream about Voldemort etc is horribly altered by adding an unrelated character - it may not seem that important, but it is. And Dumbledore - I think Michael Gambon is an exemplary actor, but to see Dumbledore lose it with Harry in such an uncharacteristic way was dumbfounding.See, I can understand why things have to be left out - it's a long book, and there are extraneous elements. For one, there's Rita Skeeter - so why keep part of her storyline in, and ignore the rest? What really annoys me, though, were the ridiculous plot and character revisions that occurred. It's such a pointless exercise that I can't even see why it was done.I don't blame Mike Newell, as I think he did a great job. In terms of the complete destruction of Dumbledore's character, you really can't blame Gambon. The only person to blame is the utter idiot that adapted it - the lack of grasp of what was important and what was not astounded me. You would think that they would have read the books and I feel sorry for the director of OOTP as they really have their work cut out - many of their main characters, that we should already be familiar with, have barely been introduced if at all. Sirius 30 second CG appearance was ridiculous. Again, I wish these people would really read the book - at one point, the expelliarmus charm managed to knock someone off their feet whilst they were still holding their wand - getting small details like that wrong is rather ridiculous too.I saw the film with my fiancé who has not read the books, and he was rather confused by it - you didn't even see the seasons change, and the film felt so rushed and the plot was so unexplained that it might as well have been 6 weeks rather than an academic year.Oh well - it's a great looking film, and I was most pleased to see the split-second appearance of Jarvis Cocker, Jonny Greenwood et al, but it's relationship to the book is somewhat distance - second cousin twice removed perhaps?",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Brilliant film,"The longest of the books is condensed successfully into a truly brilliant film. The darkness continues to grow, as Harry must compete against Edward Cullen and two foreigners in the Tri-Wizard Tournament. Gleeson is sensational, and Fiennes perfectly cast. The acting of the youngsters improves with each instalment, and Radcliffe is particularly good this time. However, it is Rickman and the older crew that continue to effortlessly dominate these wonderful films. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Fans will fancy fight of life.,"Brilliant fourth instalement sees Harry becoming a contestant in the dangerous Triwizard Tournament while also battling his arch nemesis Voldemort and clashing with the latest teenage dilemmas. At times it really scratches the surface without explaining what certain things have to do with the plot of the story and like the others, and not a great problem, it's overlong. The scene with Voldemort seems like it should be in a completely different film. However, unlike the others this is getting greatly more grownup; it has a wonderful romantic presence and has a great deal of emotion and grunt to it. Brendan Gleeson is fantastic as the latest teacher Mad-Eye Moody and so is the, more cameo, appearance by Miranda Richardson.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
incredibly awesome,"This is one of the best movies of the series so far, The Prisoner of Azkabhan was also incredible, I am 35 years old and as a father of an 11 year old I have seen all of the movies as soon as they come to the theater. This is by far the best one for adult viewers and still appeals to the young people as well. My son and I both agree that this is the best one so far and I hope that next ones will be as good. The movie has a tight storyline as expected and the cinematics are superb. The only complaint I would have is that the story was cut up so much to make it fit into the time line of the movie. If you are interested by the movie, I would recommend reading the book to get the whole story. As a matter of fact if you are interested by the movie and haven't done so yet, read the stories from the beginning.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Best Potter To Date,"HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE is the fourth film in the franchise, and the better of the four. I believe it's better on almost every level, except perhaps if you think the stories needed to stay light. GOBLET OF FIRE is the one that finally gets serious.Mentioning the serious tone, I must comment upfront that there is good reason for a PG-13 rating. Younger viewers could have some trouble (nightmares?) with some of the villains and creatures we meet here. The subject matter does grow quite dark at times, and there are moments bordering on horror. I rarely agree with the MPAA on their ratings, but this time I think it's justified; you've been warned.The darker, more serious nature of the film makes perfect sense, however. Potter and his school mates are older, and the tone of the film rings with it. More serious issues are brought to the surface, and some more adult themes, as Harry approaches adulthood. More than that, the film is the first to take itself more seriously, and I think it's just the change the series needed.The Harry Potter series overall is really not so original. It borrows from so many fantasy stories and films that I can hardly count the references any longer. It's been one of the more annoying points about the franchise overall (and why I have trouble giving higher marks to this or any of the films). There are some tangents the story takes that linger a bit long, but I've felt that was true for all the POTTER films. It's the old problem of what to leave in from the book, and what to cut. I certainly would have shorted scenes to bring down that 2 1/2 hour run time. But with GOBLET OF FIRE, we do begin to move past most of the clichés and dive deeper into the characters and some of the more creative story arc ideas, and that's certainly progress.That is not to say that the humor and fun is gone. While the laughs are tempered to fit the story, they are frequent enough without seeming forced. The acting by the young stars is better, showing that they've grown into their roles. The older actors are great as always, and new to the series is the wonderful Brendan Gleeson, and another fine actor - who I won't mention for fear of giving away a plot point.The special effects are I think standard for movies of this type - I saw nothing that really wowed me, but then again everything was strongly designed and rendered, with few if any seams showing. The music is new as well: John Williams' themes are still present, but the baton has been passed on to highly capable Patrick Doyle. He sheds new light on old motifs and generally breaths life into the musical storytelling once again. It seemed as if Williams was bored by the last film, and it's nice to hear something new even as director Mike Newell took us in a different, darker, more grown-up direction. He even found a way out of the standard Harry Potter opening scenes - I'm sure you know what I mean.For GOBLET OF FIRE to be the 4th in the series - where sequels usually sag and creak and we run out of the theater wondering what possessed us to go in the first place - it is a milestone from that perspective. I can think of few fourth outings worthy of anything but direct-to-video or late, late night TV. Moreover, it made me actually look forward to - instead of dread - the next in the series.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A turning point,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire isn't the highest craft in this series, but is a turning point. Here, the Potterverse takes its final form: shedding its clean family atmosphere and stepping into young adult fiction. Goblet of Fire is the first Potter movie rated PG-13, to fully embrace its racism metaphors, and to adopt a filmmaking style into its framework. Prisoner of Azkaban was more artistic, but Goblet of Fire absorbed that artistry into the Potterverse structure. Thus, the first two Potter films are slight corny kids' movies, the third is the surprisingly artistic one, and the rest balance craft with mass appeal.First, dark color tones and creepy production designs carry over from Prisoner of Azkaban, joining the cast and soundtrack as Potterverse staples. Goblet of Fire then sets its balance by accenting epic set pieces with filmmaking. For example, the visuals are less dynamic because the focus is on action rather than composition, yet skewed angled shots are thrown in at critical moments to drive the mood. Meanwhile, the sound design isn't abstract but does use silence for dramatic effect. This is understated but yields to Goblet of Fire's bigger action, higher stakes, and a deeper worldbuilding.Writing: 7/10

Too much missing-,"I just spent an hour or so looking at these reviews. I have to agree with the bulk of them who said the movie did no justice to the book. I was very disappointed to not see so many of the characters that were in the book. I can't believe that they actually had a harry potter movie that didn't start with the Dersley's, and a harry Potter movie without Mrs Weasley?? I love her the best! The part in the fireplace at the beginning would have played great.. what humor! The house elves were completely ignored and Rita never got what she needed in the end.What was there was great but sadly, because it was so great it made me really miss all the stuff that was left out that would have also been great. It's almost like they took several key points of the book, elaborated on them, moved characters to try to cover up what was cut then missed the mark. People know these books too well to leave so much of the story on the cutting room floor and get away with it. Everyone I talk to said the same thing, it could have been a half hour longer and covered a lot more of the wonderful detail and incredible characters that we were looking forward to seeing again. The next movie NEEDS to be three hours or they may as well not bother. If JK Rowling doesn't put out abridged books, she shouldn't allow abridged movies either.Harry Potter in all it's glory can give Tolkien a run for his money. Don't cut it short!",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Tell don't show,"I have given this film a 6 because as a Harry Potter fan, I must admit this film did well in visualizing scenes from the Goblet of Fire book. However, viewed as a cinematic work it was very disappointing. The characters of Fred and George are more prominent adding a lot of comedy to the film, but almost all of the jokes were dependent on them, most of the jokes being slapstick. With Harry being 14 years old in this film, obviously there is going to be a new adolescent sexuality to his character, but that was the main topic of the film when he wasn't battling a dragon or casting a spell. Some scenes with this new sexuality lasted precious minutes past their prime, leaving no room for the amazing older actors such as Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman. Emma Watson was adorable as Hermione in the first film, but now she doesn't seem to be able to portray emotion without melodramatics. The main problem with this film, however, is trying to fit a some 600 page book into a 2 1/2 hour film. The book was well represented, I have no beef as a Potter fan about that. But trying to fit in all these pages lead to the most blatant explication imaginable. Film is a visual medium with sound attached. In intro screen writing classes, the number one lesson is to show not tell, which Steve Klove seemed to completely ignore. All the questions that arise during the film are nicely and neatly explained with a dull conversation between Harry and one of his smarter companions. He hardly finds anything out for himself. My advice, wait until it comes out on video, that way you can fall asleep in the comfort of your own home.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
There was the good.....but the bad...,"After reading all the reviews for this movie, I can't help but wonder if half of the people who seen this movie actually read the book? Well let's get straight to the facts.The movie was OK. There were definitely its strong parts. The special effects are amazing; the acting has definitely got better, and Voldemort was portrayed beautifully, and I must say, the ending definitely saved the movie from a total disaster.But if you would like me to ramble on and on about the good parts, well, that's what the hundreds of positive other reviews in this site is for.There definitely was a lot of material to cover in the fourth book and being a 2 ½ hour long movie, I was expecting parts to be cut; I wasn't disappointed, but actually amazed on how much was cut! The entire movie felt like it was being rushed. Before you could fully understand what was happening, another event begins which caused so much confusion. I was glad to have read the book, otherwise I would've gotten lost in the first 10 min of the film. Key explanations of what was happening were condensed into sentences that the audience could barely catch. Many time, there were whispers in the theater; ""what did he say"" ""did you catch that last word?"" ""what was that?"" A prime example would be during the Defense Against the Dark art class scene. My friend didn't even know what any of the three unforgivable curses were because the scene was extremely quick and choppy (in fact the entire movie felt choppy).Character development was horrible (if there was any at all). The fight between Ron and Harry, and Ron and Hermione was completely lost. One minute they're all together as happy as can be, then the next all three won't even speak to each other (once again, the choppiness of the film played a part). Key characters were also thrust into the movie with no introduction at all. Rita Skeeter, instead of being sly and devilish, was quite annoying in the movie and I couldn't believe her scandal was dropped entirely! Also Dumbledore was portrayed COMPLETELY WRONG! He no longer looks or act like a wise, all-knowing and powerful wizard whom Voldemort fears, but rather a old geezer in the background.Key events where put in with no reason at all. The scene in Snape's potion closet where they were discussing about the Dark Mark was pointless because the movie never came back on the fact that Snape was also once a Death Eater and has a Dark Mark himself. The scene in the Prefect's bathroom where there was so many sexual jokes is so unnecessary and the stained glass window with the naked mermaid, what was all that about? The traps and the monsters in the maze were completely left out! The world Quidditch cup was so short; makes the audience wonder ""where was the action?"" The most annoying part in the movie I have to say, was the Yule Ball. OMG! WTF was that!? The set was horribly made, everything was modernized, and character choices were just plain bad (Harry and Ron going out with two Indian girls just really didn't fit in). There great hall where the ball took place seemed smaller and cramped. There was confetti and pieces of decoration littered allover the floor (and I could've sworn I saw paper party plate). The concert like dance thing was just a total disaster and did not at all fit into the movie. At times I was asking myself ""am I watching a Harry Potter movie?"" The sense of ""magicalness"" was taken away in this once scene. Hogwarts no long looked like a grand, magical place but rather like in the inside of a high school gym during prom.I can't imagine in my wildest dream the ball turned out the way it did. I expected to be real formal and classical. The director did a horrible job doing it (this is probably the worst part of the movie and ruined the entire Harry Potter series). When the DVD comes out, I can just imagining fast forwarding through the dance.Too much time and effort was done trying to make this movie look good with special effects and humor that the essence of Harry Potter was ruined; character and plot development. The director modernized the movie too much making Hogwarts seem like more of a typical American high school (with immature kids and even a school band) rather then a grand place where people of a higher society go to learn magic (which by the way there was hardly any classroom scene in the movie).I'd much rather have the movie run four or even five hours long, then to sit through certain part of this movie again. I really hope the next movie is as good, or at least able to explain the book, the way the first three did. *sigh* (disappointed)",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Just sit back and enjoy. I did!,"I went to the cinema to this and i heard it was 2hrs and 45mins long approx. Do not let that put you off. I enjoyed every minute of this superb film. This is without doubt the best in the series so far. the other films will have to be the best ever made to beat this! Some of the scenes were amazing from the Quidditch game in the large arena to the chase in the massive maze at the end. The acting is superb from everyone. There was not one performance in this film i did not enjoy - they were all equally brilliant! Another reason why i loved this film is that i did not think The Prisoner of Azkaban was that brilliant. For anyone else who thought that, do not panic - this one delivers the goods! Just sit back and enjoy. I did!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Lots missing but you hardly notice,"I cannot say enough about Brendan Gleason and Ralph Fiennes, two actors that have given more in their respective performances than you could hope for. Everything that Voldemort represents, the way he looks and sounds, even how he holds his wand, all are exquisitely realized in Fiennes' performance. And Gleason's portrayal of Moody is more than masterful. It is fun and thrilling.One reason why I continue to go to the movies even though I'm now 53 years old is the amazement I feel and the admiration I have for the movie makers' ability to show me something I never imagined. I've read GoF three times, but there were so many beautifully realized images given to us by the film makers that so far surpassed anything that I saw in my mind's eye. It's tough to tag the absolute best. I was as likely to be tickled by a small thing as by, say, the stupendous emergence of the Durmstrang ship from out of the lake. For example, the curtsy by the girls from Beauxbatons as they entered the Great Hall was one of those wonderful little movie touches that only last a moment but make a lasting impression. Certainly everyone was wowed by the moving TV screen inside the quidditch stadium, but I find the attention to detail in the less spectacular scenes to be more memorable.Other examples: The owlery is now a separate tower from the rest of the castle. I thought that was a very neat idea. And making the maze fill up the valley behind Hogwarts instead of occupying just the quidditch pitch was nifty, too. The emulation of wallflowers by Harry and Ron with their moping dates was perfectly done. The tension in Moody's first Defense class was ominous and palpable. Snape climbing the ladder in his potions store was just right. The transformation of the spacious wizard courtroom of the novel into the crammed and cramped little chamber with the open air iron maiden in the middle was beautifully done. The sweet moments with Hagrid and Madame Maxime as when his hand slips down to her rump during the ball and she hoists it back up to the small of her back...the awkward and touching encounter between Harry and Cho in the owlery...Moody making faces behind McGonagall's back...these things are what make seeing the movies such a pleasure. And Goblet of Fire is loaded with them.Sure, there were things that didn't please me as much. For example, the maze's only menace came from the clinging vines and a possessed Krum. No spider, no blast-ended skrewts, and no sphinx. But the climax in the graveyard made up for it.I'm at the age where my ability to hear the middle tones of peoples' voices is affected. Thus my disappointment with Rupert Grint whom I'd considered the strongest actor of the big three. I had to keep myself from calling out, ""Mumbling! I can't understand you!"" as Willy Wonka would say. The theater in which I saw GoF had the volume turned way up so I shouldn't have missed any dialog. But, as it was, I had to have missed half of Grint's dialog because of his grunting.Some of the things that are missing: Rita Skeeter is never revealed as an animagus; there is no confrontation with a disbelieving Fudge at the end; and no elves whatsoever! That I thought would have been difficult to pull off, but screenwriter Steve Kloves managed it.But even as I think of the shortcomings and disappointments I'm again thrilled by all of the marvelous things in this movie: Sirius Black's appearance in the fire as a face made out of living coals; Karkaroff's confession from inside the iron maiden; McGonagall's scolding of Moody after he turned Malfoy into a ferret and forced him down Crabbe's pants; the departure of the Beauxbatons carriage and its salute of the Durmstrang ship way out on the lake; Miranda Richardson's performance as Rita Skeeter; Harry's leap out of the water once he has his gills; and Harry saying, ""I love magic!"" This movie wasn't a 10 or even a 9, and I still like The Prisoner of Azkaban better, but wow! What a thrilling ride!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Good, but flawed","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire may be the most truncated 2hr, 45 minute movie ever made. To say that the pace is brisk may well be an understatement. It moves with the ferocity of a tornado, catching you up in its excitement then tossing you to the ground wishing you had better warning. This is purely a movie for fans that have read the book - while others will probably enjoy it, they will probably get lost because of a lack of proper explanations of everything.That's not to say that it's a bad movie, either. While I was watching the movie I was enjoying every minute of it. I was caught up in the joy of the Harry Potter experience, yet keenly aware that this could have been more with just a few minor changes.You've probably already read plot details and dissertations on the fidelity of the movie to the experiences of a hormonally-charged adolescent. I'll skip that. As far as a summary of my opinions on parts of the movie: The acting was fair-to-good, cinematography was great, but the writing was bad. There were many top-notch performances in limited screen time from Maggie Smith (Prof. McGonagall), Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy), Ralph Fiennes (Voldemort), Miranda Richardson (Rita Skeeter), and Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid). Harry, Hermione, and Ron hold their own, but are not given great dialog to work with, and I think they tend to overact a touch - nothing to pull anyone out of the movie, but I've seen better from all of them. The source material was quite good (best of the series, IMHO), but the adaptation was lacking at several points. The dialog was average and served little more than to move the story along, which was disappointing, considering that the look of the movie was so great. It's mostly seeped in neutral tones to lend an ominous feel to the film, and thankfully, the special effects are finally used as a supplementary device, rather than the showpiece; you feel like the creators are exploring the world rather than building it, and it helps to more thoroughly envelop the viewer in the story.This movie needed about a half-hour more of padding. Those that have not read the book will have to work very hard to pick up every little clue and detail about what's going on in order to put together this labyrinthine plot. The Tri-Wizards tournament, a legendary sporting event with mystical significance was explained by a short speech by Dumbledore, a speech that was jam-packed with expository information that, unless the viewer was ready to absorb, could easily be missed and not digested.Everything in this movie just sort of happens without regard for previous events or future events - this is called a pacing problem. The Tri-Wizards tournament features three events, but all three events are scenes with almost no build, nothing to give them the weight they could have had. There's no sense of the Tri-Wizards tournament having any impact on the participants' lives, which is ironic seeing that the Goblet of Fire is first and foremost about the events surrounding that tournament. Each trial comes suddenly, gets fifteen minutes of screen time, then disappears. The characters go about their business for another while and then all of the sudden the next trial happens, with little warning. I was so stunned by the appearance of the third trial that as the band played and the participants entered the stadium, I doubted whether or not the scene to come was about the tournament. Like I said, there was no build to lend gravitas to the final scene, almost like going on a roller coaster where you're immediately dropped 100 feet and then coast the rest of the way. The climax comes too quickly, which is stunning considering the running time.The other issue that I had, a more minor one, is that everything in this film happens with minimal regard for the outside world. This is a shame because one of the charms of the book was about how much it fleshed out the Wizarding universe that Harry lived in. I know the movie should be treated on its own terms, but some of these events, detailed in the book, are left hanging. How did this guy escape from Azkaban? What happened to the reporter? Who exactly are these other kids that show up at Hogwarts? Why is the guy that played Krum such a bad actor? In the end, I give the movie a 7, because, as I say, I throughly enjoyed watching it and will probably see it again. This is due more to the source material than it is to the adaptation, though; unlike Prisoner of Azkaban, this movie doesn't really stand on its own, but is more of a visual representation of certain scenes from the book. It's extremely entertaining, but maddening because of how great it COULD have been.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Awesome,"This movie was actually not that bad. I thought it would be the same like the third one but its not. good thing they changed the director.they sticked with the book pretty well, but of coursed missed out on some bits. otherwise it was great. the actors and actresses are all grown up...too grown up for their character. they did act pretty well. i just don't like the new dumbledore, i like the old one from the first and second one.Love the ball...choochang was alright..i think..special effects and everything are also good. not that fake.so many action going on...here and there...two thumbs up!! for the team behind this fourth one!!! great job! (cant say anything else that might spoil the fun) Recommend it to anyone who loves this epic..",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Best Series,"I first watched this episode in 2018 on Machranga Television dubbed in Bengali. It touched my heart so much that I searched a lot whether it is available on any web site in Bengali language. I saw it in Hindi after not finding it for a long time. Truly the best English language movie series for me. So far no movie or movie series has touched the mind of Harry Potter. For me all movies are below Harry Potter.A movie to watch with a family. The costumes are very good. Although it is made for kids, I would say it is best as an adventure movie.The story, acting and production are all excellent. I definitely recommend others to see something like this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Flashy Superficial Treatment with Damsels in Distress,"At first blush the movie comes across well; but by the end you are left feeling you watched a highlight reel. Others I have spoken with mentioned getting restless in the last 45 minutes; which they hadn't done in the previous movies. The movie has great special effects, is sufficiently dark to equate to the book; but simply does not maintain a well-edited flow of a story. Granted, the movie needed to cut a good portion of the book to fit into the time constraints. Sadly, the choice of scenes and script did a mediocre choice of what to put on film.A key element of the book was the attack at the match grounds and subsequent deaths, all part of the plan for ""ethnic cleansing"" and Voldemort's return. The panic this engendered was dealt with to a mild degree during the course of the movie; but never actually explained. Instead, you had a random attack by people in hoods, a death here, a death there, etc. No real rationale was given, nor a hint that they were related. Those having not read the novels are left without essential basic information to the plot.One glaring trend throughout the book is that the director apparently has a very low opinion of the female of the species; as opposed to the portrayal in the novels. The primary purpose of females in the movie appeared to be as arm-hangers and damsels in distress tied to the track awaiting rescue. Emma Watson was primarily a love-struck water-carrier and Clémence Poésy was a simpering incompetent either getting trounced or needing rescue. Even little niggling things like showing the dragons of the three male competitors; but not the female became noticeable in the running trend. For reasons of full disclosure, I am a father with a daughter. I, like other such fathers, do notice these things.All in all, it's worth seeing (once). Although, I can understand why Mike Newell was paid one-tenth of what Chris Columbus was paid.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Great and Spooky!,"If I would pick my best movie i would pick this movie. I've heard people say a lot about it, then i watched it and thought it was the best!

One very good movie,"No movie adaptation of a book is ever perfect. It is a fact of life. However there are times when the essence of a book is captured very well and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is one of those movies.It is Harry Potters fourth year at the magical school of Hogwarts. This year things are a bit different as Hogwarts plays host to two other schools all of which will compete in the legendary Tri Wizard Tournament. Things do not go as planned and soon Harry finds himself competing in a dangerous contest facing dragons, enchanted mazes and much worse.The Goblet of Fire is a very good addition to the Harry Potter franchise (we can all call it that now). It is great to see the actors mature as the films have and how things at Hogwarts have deepened as well.The actors all do a great job with one exception, which I will talk about later. The scenes between Harry, Ron and Hermoine are all well done and you can see the chemistry between the kids. Add to this the amazing talents of the original adults and Brendan Gleeson fantastic job as Mad Eye Moody.The story is well adapted from the book. Again it is not perfect but it isn't supposed to be. Perfect adaptations end up being maxi-series on TV. The writing was genuine however and the interaction between characters should great insight into the book and characters.The FX are amazing and very well done. The blending between what was real and CGI has been refined well and these FX masters show their talents off well.My only issue with this film is Michael Gambon, who has been playing Albus Dumbledore beginning with the third Potter film. He took the role after the death of Richard Harris who played Dumbledore in the first two films. In the first two films and in the books Dumbledore is a silent yet strong figure who has the mere presence of authority and respect. Richard Harris portrayed this perfectly in a silent yet refined way. He gave Dumbledore an air that every move action and word was carefully chosen with deep intellect while making the character as whimsical and off beat as in the book. Gambon lacks this skill in the most horrid ways. I am not bashing Gambon in anyway, he is an amazing character actor. Being a character actor however is his greatest flaw. He exaggerates, throws his arms, explodes his voice, looks as if he is on the verge of lost control, all of which Dumbledores character is not and does not. In so many scenes Dumbledore is more of a bumbling old man seeming to need more aid from a nurse than the wise and whimsical guide he is in the first films and books.I look forward to the next Potter film but hope, with all respect to him, that Gambon will be replaced by a much more refined and controlled character.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Worth seeing. Much better than the first three.,"The Harry Potter books are wonderful. You should read them, no matter what age you are. I can pick any one of them up, open a page and start reading.As for the movies, first one, dull and overcooked; second one, a bit better but still overcooked; third one, a bit better than the last one. Steve Kloves - writer, just wants to stuff everything in when more cutting is required. Thankfully, his script is much tighter in this one.This movie is darker, edgier and much more satisfying. For a start, the kids are much better. In the first three they weren't very good. In fact, I would argue with people that they should replace Daniel Radcliffe as I thought he was bad to the point of distraction. Now I know they're young and I'm not expecting Haley Joel Osment here but just a little naturalness. But in this film they are all much improved. With the Yule ball and all that talk of hormones and the slowly growing love thing between Ron and Hermione, I thought it would be embarrassing but it was okay.The movie was faithful to the book and the pace was very good. However, a few changes could have made to make this an excellent movie.Firstly, Dumbledore is too angry and emotional. They're obviously trying to make it more dramatic but those who know him know he's actually quite a serene character nearly all the time. Thoughtful, wise and stately. Michael Gambon (The Cook, the thief, his wife, and her lover)is a good actor but he's still a bit short and round for the part.They should have really cut down on the dragon scene. It's way too drawn out and unbelievable.They should have buffed up the big resurrection scene (you know what I'm talking about). Not much sense of occasion here. This is THE absolutely huge event in the Potter series and all it is is a bunch of flashing lights and its over. Again, as in all the movies, a feeling of not knowing what to condense and what to expand. Where's the breeze rustling the leaves of the yule trees and the creepy build up? They could have really bought this home.Ralph Fiennes' interpretation. I really like Fiennes and a lot of people praised his performance. But, like Dumbledore, they made him too emotional. He snarled and spat and screamed while his character is actually more calm, cold, intelligent and menacing. This guy is like a nutter escaped from an asylum. When I say Ralph's interpretation, maybe I should be saying Mike Newell's.They should have cut Rita Skeeter. Not worth it. Loved Miranda Richardson in Black Adder. Maybe she should have played Professor Trelawney ... or Narcissa Malfoy. There's a thought.Anyway, these are mostly criticism but it is only because the movie is already so entertaining and so satisfying that they rankle that bit more. As I speak they've already cast Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange - good job. They must have seen her sexy performance in 'Fight Club.'",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Getting Worse,"This latest installment of Harry Potter was a bit of a letdown. First off let me declare that I have never read any of the books (and probably never will; I have more important things to read). I also never read Lord of The Rings either. The point being that I don't think it's necessary to read any books that have been transferred to the big screen. A movie should be able to stand on its own. The first three films were quite engrossing with all the special effects and intriguing characters but this one shifted focus too much between former and new characters. The threat of Voldermort returns yet again and it's getting pretty old. Harry Potter still has no composure whilst Ron is just as idiotic as he's always been. Hermoine is growing up but there's too little focus on her. Some parts of the movie were quite difficult to understand too. I get the impression they think we would have or perhaps should later buy and read the book. I don't really have a problem with these kids growing up on screen and don't believe it's the reason why this movie was not as interesting as its predecessors. The reason it wasn't as good is probably because too many scenes are wasted on trivial matters instead of developing characters and good dialog. In a way, it's similar to the new Spider-man movies where he just can't decide what he wants to be and takes the 'good guy' thing too far. Harry better shape up and get something going on with Hermoine in the next film. And they should kill off Ron in the next movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Best of the books and best of the movies.,"First of all I was disappointed that the scene at the Dursley's wasn't done and the omission of a major character from the book was done. You see Harry, Hermione, and Ron take their steps into adulthood preparing for what is about to come. Placed in a situation beyond his training Harry is confronted by the thing her fears the most. The corporation with other schools of ""magic"" and the danger in the tournament are well done. This is where the series takes a ""darker turn"" and as J.K.

Just read my comment yo!,"First of all, I thought Mike Newell totally f**ck-ed up a great story like Harry Potter. Of course, if you aren't someone original like me who read the book before the movie was released, of course you're going to think, ""WOW! That was great!"" Wel f*ck that.. This movie wasn't great this time at all! Mike Newell excluded plenty of big parts from this movie that were written by JK Rowling herself. A part such as where in the end, they were supposed to be shown leaving for the summer and at the train station, where Hermione was supposed to kiss Harry on the cheek and such. Well, thanks Mike Newell for screwing up Harry Potter's true story. But other than that, thanks, because for those who hadn't read the book before, it still was a great movie overall!",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Uhhh,"It would have been a great *summary* if they had noticed one thing. WHY ON EARTH DID THEY DOWN PLAY SIRIUS'S FATHER ROLE?!?!?!?

If anyone has any ideas as to why he was basically cut out of the last 3/4 of the movie. It would be appreciated. It just seemed as if Gary Oldman died after filming that one scene and they decided to not replace him or something... (he isn't dead by the way)...I did enjoy most of the rest of the movie. They did well containing its length for viewers 9unlike myself0 that do not wish to sit and watch a 5 hour movie.I say bring back Alfonso Cuaron... he did a beautiful job with the third, and I hope the fifth will be better than this one at least.Who ever gave this 10 out of 10 you are crazy and need to reread the book...",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
I'll be very sad if they remake this,"The Harry Potter films helped make my childhood a very exciting time indeed, playing with my friends with sticks on the playground pretending they were wands and we were duelling. I fondly remember seeing this when it first came out, I thought it was amazing and met up with my best friend at Burger King straight after it had finished and mischievously trying to eat our Burger King food like Buckbeak the hippogriff.I found a lot of things funny in this movie, especially as a child. It causes me much mirth imagining Peter Pettigrew changing baby Voldemort's nappies. I find it very amusing how Voldemort has no nose and continue to call people Voldemort if they have a very small nose. What makes it funnier is his followers really wanted be like Voldemort and therefore I suppose they may have wanted slits instead of a nose as well.I took great inspiration from the Yule Ball and Ron's dress robes during my school years, I loved how much Ron's dress robes made him stand out and made Padme Patil so stunned when she saw them like as if she was close to crying tears of joy! I dressed in similar dress robes as the ones Ron had on at the Yule Ball during my Prom Night. I made quite a sight which left me beaming with joy at all the attention I received, so thanks so much Ron!I learned from this movie to ask girls out on a date very fast indeed and to not delay any proposal to a girl or woman at all. This influenced me to ask a girl out on a date for the first time, who happened to be my cousin and we fell in love and now live happily together. This movie teaches valuable life lessons and is very smart in how it executes these lessons in such a complex way which leaves one thinking deeply about even just a certain quote for hours on end at times. The film is deep, magical and above all heart warming to very core which allows this film to exist most prominently in my soul/heart for all eternity more than any other film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A waste of my precious time,"Having read the first three books and being thoroughly unimpressed, I was unsurprised by this film. Knowing before-hand that John Williams was not continuing his role as composer for the film, I should have expected that any charm the earlier films had held would evaporate with this fourth instalment. The story itself is incredible enough-why would any school permit a tournament in which students are so frequently killed?-but compounded with the seemingly tacked on sub-plot of romance which is never completely fulfilled, the film itself ends up being an incredulous piece of garbage, even within its own setting. While the film looks extremely impressive, the set design is not enough to distract from the flailing plot and the unconvincing characterisations",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Decent entry in the Potter film collection,"There are some entertaining moments in this the fourth instalment in the Harry Potter film franchise, not least an entertaining performance from Brendan Gleason. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are excellent as always- JK Rowling must be so happy that these three were chosen to bring her superbly imagined world to light.

Look out too for Clemence Poesy, future star of The Tunnel making her first entrance in the series.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Fourth Potter Installment Falls Just Short,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire recounts the events of Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe) fourth year at Hogwarts, a school for young witches and wizards. The movie begins slightly before the school year does when Arthur Weasley (Mark Williams) takes his family and a few friends to the World Quidditch Tournament. Harry, and his best friends, Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) are thrilled, especially when they're able to see the ""world's greatest seeker,"" Viktor Krum (Stanislav Ianevski) play. But when the tournament festivities are attacked by Death Eaters, the fun and games quickly come to an end.Harry and his friends leave the abruptly terminated matches directly for Hogwarts where they're thrilled to hear Professor Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) announce that their school will be the site of the infamous Tri-Wizard Tournament this year. Students from two other schools  Durmstrang and Beauxbatons  will join those at Hogwarts for the contest which is strictly limited to those age 17 and older due to the inherent dangers involved. The magical goblet of fire spits out names from each of the schools: Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson) from Hogwarts, Fleur Delacour (Clémence Poésy) from Beauxbatons, and the famous Viktor Krum himself from Durmstrang are to compete. But then the goblet spews forth one more name: Harry Potter.Though too young to compete, the rules are clear: if the goblet offers up a name, that student must participate. Harry is terrified, and can only hope he survives the contests to come. He has some hope of doing so, but only with help from Ron and Hermione; groundskeeper and good friend Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane); the newest Dark Arts teacher, Alastor ""MadEye"" Moody (Brendan Gleeson); and, strangely enough, the incompetent-at-just-about-everything Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis).If all this isn't enough, Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) and his father, Luscious (Jason Isaacs) continue to plague Harry; Potions instructor, Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) is still no friend to Harry; and Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) might just be making a comeback. Mix all of this with Harry's crush on a fellow student, Cho Chang (Katie Leung); a nasty falling out with Ron; and a true tabloid-type reporter for The Daily Prophet (Rita Skeeter, played by Miranda Richardson), and you'll begin to understand why Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was such a substantial book and such a disappointing film.I could, I suppose, blame great anticipation for a bit of my disappointment. But I think it's probably more fair to blame the severe editing needed to squeeze a lengthy book into a two and a half hour time frame. As it was, the World Quidditch Tournament  which was an absolute delight to watch  was on screen all too briefly. The unexplained attack by the Death Eaters would have been more than a little confusing to those who haven't read the book. And the necessity to pack so much into the film meant that favorite characters  such as the malevolent Malfoys, the acerbically funny Minerva McGonagall (Maggie Smith), and the delightful Weasley twins, Fred and George (James and Oliver Phelps)  were given short shrift.The acting is just fine from all of the youthful cast. The acting is quite a bit better than fine from Brendan Gleeson and, in her limited screen time, Maggie Smith. The special effects, as is to be expected, were superlative (pay particular attention to a feisty Welsh dragon), as were the sets. The direction seemed to elicit everything it needed to from the actors, and the editing was largely well done. But so much happened so quickly that there was little opportunity to really become emotionally invested in the film, and that's unfortunate seeing as how this part of Harry's story marks a real emotional watershed for him and his nearest and dearest.It seems to me that Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire would have lent itself well to a two-part series or, failing that, should have been longer. Peter Jackson (the Oscar-winning director of the brilliant Lord of the Rings series) proved audiences would sit still for three and a half hour movies provided they're good ones, and the Harry Potter movies are among the few with stories that really are that good. Did I like the movie? Yes, I did. But it could have been better...FAMILY SUITABILITY: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is rated PG-13 for ""sequences of fantasy violence and frightening images."" I read one review where it was suggested that those too young to read the hefty book are too young to see the movie, and I'd agree. There are injuries, deaths, and other assorted nasty things that simply are not suitable for small children. Older Harry Potter fans (say 11 or so and up) will be fine, though, and will love seeing everything they've imagined (and then some) coming to life on the big screen. It's no small feat that even a movie that could have been so much better was still so good!",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Good & Bad of GoF,"OK, This Harry Potter installment was a biggie. There was a lot of things going on at once which i believe is very hard to portray in only a 2 and 1/2 hour movie. From the Beging this Movie is constant action. It puts us directly into the story without warning. So much of this constant action leaves little time to explain what is going on. This movie left out many key characters or doesn't give characters enough time to be in the movie. The Dursleys are not in the movie at all neither is Leudo Bagman and of course Winky. Also I believe that Sirius should have been in the movie more for he is now very close to Harry, as well as Harry's friends Ron & Hermione. I felt that they spent little time in the movie also. Draco was left out in the cold for this one. He only participated in the scene with the ferret (though that was a great scene). Some themes were also left out that I would have liked to see but it is understandable that something have to be cut out.I believe they should have definitely put the involvement of Rita Skeeter being a Animagius as well as more of the Quidditch World Cup and the Winky subplot. Besides the movie lacking some important characters and points I felt it lived up to the others standards. The Triwizard Tournament was extremely compelling and exciting. The Look and Visual effects were again amazing and the acting also extremely well done. So All in All i believe that the director did a pretty good job in fitting in so much into one movie. Though I would have like to see more, Such as the characters I mentioned as well as other themes and parts of the book I found important the look of the movie was flawless as well as the acting. My advice to The Movie Crew of GoF is to focus more on the whole story (not just Harry, though he is very important) and to slow things down not try and fit everything in at one movie but maybe extend the movie. Also put a lot of deleted scenes & extra content on the DVD and I think well be goodThanks for Reading",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
bloody brilliant!,"This movie is indeed, the best out of the series yet. The Harry Potter movies are getting better and better each time! :) Mike Newell for PRESIDENT!

Favorite Book...Least Favorite Film,"Having read all six in the series and owing the first three films on DVD, I can say that this film depends on the audience familiarity with Rowling's world. It is visually beautiful, and we are able to witness the development of each character in a way that is true to the actor..I would guess that the first 200 pages are represented in the first 10 minutes of the film. These minutes were an abbreviated nod to the book's content similar to a story board.Deviating from the original story line was a necessity. By eliminating the house elves and the Dursleys, valuable minutes were reclaimed for the TriWizard Tournament..Given the brevity of dedicated film time, all reference to the Quidditch World Cup and Rita Skeeter could have been eliminated, as could Haggrid's romance and the unexplained friction between Ron and Harry. I had to explain a number of issues to my husband who has not read anything of the series.There is always a danger in seeing the film of a favorite book. The vision is always better in our heads.Too little of too many subplots exist to be truly satisfying, but we are forgiving. After all, it is Harry Potter.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Worst Harry Potter movie ever!!!!!,"This Harry Potter movie was the worst Potter movie I have ever watched. After reading the book numerous times and then listening to it on Books on Tape even more, I was expecting something amazing, something that would surly surpass the first three movies. Yet, this movie fell dismally short of used toilet paper. I felt sick after seeing it. I had been looking forward to it since I first heard about it. But again I was let down. There were so many important and relevant characters that were not only left out, but completely ignored. These characters are paramount in the development of the story and how this story leads into the next. I cannot believe that J.K. Rowling even Okayed this script. Is she so concerned with money that she would not stop something so terrible? Where are her morals and beliefs, especially when it is her hard work being put on a movie screen for every one to watch? I have been reading the reviews of this movie on CNN, MSNBC, New York Times, and Google and all the ""move critics"" that have written these reviews cannot stop raving about how wonderful this movie is. Do they know a bad movie when they see it? Did these movie critics even read the book? Do they have any idea what is not happening in the movie? And who is not in it? Or are they so busy with making sure that they sound good that they don't want to step on any one's toes? Where are their stones when it comes to criticizing? That they choose to kiss ass then actually report the fact that the movie sucked is pathetic. This movie sucked. This director sucks. If you want to know how a person will do in the future, look at his past. His past movies sucked, this movie sucked, his future movies will suck. If he is directing any more Potter movies I will refuse to see them and I encourage everyone else to do the same. Stick with the book. Hollywood does not know how to anything correctly. 2 and ½ hours of crap. 2 and ½ hours of watching a half ass-ed director slash and hack at an amazing book and butcher the imaginations' of children is unbearable.

"New director, franchise improved.","This film is the adaptation of the fourth book in the saga of Harry Potter, written by J. K. Rowling. Alfonso Cuaron, who directed the previous film, leaves the franchise and gives way for Mike Newell, which comes almost as a contingency solution for the place. However, it was an excellent bet and gave fairly good results, with the film to show a marked improvement and the first use of massive and impressive special and computerized effects. It's also the first film where we see Harry Potter and his friends as teenagers they already are, a brand that comes up, very quietly, in the book, but Newell explores in this film, where the action and fight scenes also become more intense. The actors remain basically the same and fidelity to detail and descriptions of the original book is still evident.

What happened?????,"I have to say first of all that I am a die-hard fan of the books, I own them all (as well as all the movies on DVD). I started out watching the movies and then began reading the books after I saw Prisoner of Azkaban. I don't know if it is because this is the first time I have ever seen a movie after I have read the book or not but I was truly disappointed in the film. I keep reading about how everyone is so impressed with the screenplay and adaptation of the book and I think they are totally wrong. I know that everything is totally different in the story from this book on but the movie and the book took totally opposite directions. There was no character development, the film focused solely on the Tri-Wizard tournament and the return of Voldemort. Not that these things aren't important but they don't matter if they are the only things happening in the movie. We should have been told about Barty's son and his whole story when he was captured. As well as dozens of other sub plots that were just ripped out of the story. What about the Quidditch World Cup? And Winkey the house elf? And Neville didn't give Harry the gilly-weed, Dobby did. This movie left so much to be desired. I hope that Order of the Phoenix is done better or they get a different director or screen writer.

Harry Potter Better Than Expected,"Let me say that this is the first Harry Potter movie I've seen and I thought I was going to hate it. But I found myself having a good time watching it. If I thought the first three installments were going to be just as impressive as this one. I would've watched them before seeing the Goblet of Fire. The whole cast including Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson are great in their roles. The rest of the talented supporting cast includes Robbie Coltrane, Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith, Emma Thompson, and Brendan Gleeeson who also turn in admirable performances but they lack screen time only showing up for brief appearances here and there. The pacing was a little slow at times too but the good outweighs the bad in this one. Ralph Fiennes does a decent job with the brief cameo role he has near the end as the evil Lord Voldemort. He's nearly unrecognizable and Fiennes definitely makes for an imposing villain but he like other characters lacks screen time. Besides the pacing the film seems to be juggling too many characters a problem some other movies have had as well (Spider-man 3 and X-Men Origins: Wolverine to name a few). With it's flaws aside though this Harry Potter is a good film to watch. It has intense action, cool special effects, terrific acting for the most part, and some humor thats sure to please any fan of the genre or the book.

"Yeah, unfortunate.","It is unfortunate, though they left out a few vital details. That they could've wasted another ten minutes on to address.Such as the whole Rita Skeeter is a animagus, that's a big bribe in the fifth one, how will they fix up that? I mean, ten more minutes won't kill you. I mean, look at 10th Kingdom or Gone with the Wind, I'm fine sitting down for a few hours and watching a good movie, especially if I'm OBSESSED with the book it is based off of.Also, they left out a lot of components from the maze, it's not suppose to move! It's suppose to actually have things in it, I was looking forward to seeing some Blast-Ended Skwerts, too. xD Also, they left out the whole Winky/CrouchJr Azkaban plot. That was a whole underlining base to the bloody plot, they didn't even explain how they did it. AND Voldemort did not explain himself, as he did in the book, sure that speech took a while, but, man, it explained a lot of things, like why he survived, and what not, they address that, but so briefly you can miss it.Also, when being held by the gravestone, it's obvious, he could've easily gotten out of it. They should've stuck with Pettigrew and the binding charm thing. >.> Yeah, just a portion of my frustrations at them, I'm so glad that the rest of the books aren't //that// long, I want NO reason to why they left things out, I mean, jeez, it's like their producer read the one book he was about to make the movie on, leaving out a few vital points, he should've realized at least some of it was important. >.> I mean, wasting ten or so minutes on the preparation for the ball? Jeez, with those, you could've explained a lot more stuff.[//rant]]",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
IF You Have Read The Book DO NOT GO AND SEE THIS!!!,"The only thing that was in common between the film and the book was the characters names!!!! I appeciate the fact that the book is indeed rather long and showing its entirety in the film would be impossible; but it feels as if someone has simple read every other chapter and made the film; this film should have been another hour longer!! The beginning of the book has simply been removed from the book and we start about one fifth of the way in, so those who have read the book will be annoyed from the start. Out of all of the Potter books the goblet of fire was by FAR my favourite, and from what I have read, the favourite of most, and so I had high expectations from the film, and was castastrophical disappointed. I went to see the film which some girls who had never read the books and they thoroughly enjoyed the film, as did the small children who were in the cinema. Credit were it is due though, the special effects are better than the previous films, and generally the acting has indeed improved, and for this reason I have not given the film a 1 rating, though I was tempted.I know that those who have read the book will indeed go and see the film anyhow, but I must warn you do not get your hopes up.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Entertaining, but too rushed and choppy","I went to see this film at Vue at 4:00 today and I was really hoping for entertaining Potter film - I got one but the price for it was a very rushed film. My main criticisms for this film other than it was too choppy is that Emma Watson's acting became a bit too over-the-top at times, and as much as I admire the girl, it just has to be said. I also found some parts to be laughable(mostly with Emma in them) when it wasn't meant to be. An example of this is the over emphasising of her points she makes with her eyebrows and how she acted in the Defense Against The Dark Arts lesson scene when she answered the question of 'Unforgivable Curses'.Apart from the above, the film was very enjoyable and exciting, especially the three Triwizard Tournament tasks, like the third task that made me jump in my seat a couple of times when the hedges closed in around Harry. The first task was particularly thrilling when Harry's fingertips held on for dear life on the rooftops turrets of Hogwarts castle as the Hungarian Horntail tries to kill him. As for the second task, that was just as I imagined it when I read the book, and was also really fun to watch.The parts about the realisation of the opposite sex was particularly funny as it was so true to life, although this is a fantasy, as when the boys were asked to dance they declined. Same with Ron(played wonderfully by Rupert Grint) who translated so well onto the screen the ways teen boys have problems dealing with the opposite sex. Another good example is when he argues with Hermione after the Yule Ball and when he sees the Beaubatons girls for the first time.Dan Radcliffe's performance was moved up a notch from Prisoner of Azkaban(I hated the cringe worthy 'He was their friend, and he betrayed them - He was their FRIEND!'). I, for once, couldn't find a fault in his performance - He IS Harry. The final scenes with Voldemort were spectacular(like when Voldemort's and Harry's wands joined together by a red light) and Dan didn't fail to impress. Ralph Fiennes is chilling as Lord Voldemort himself and I literally cowered in my seat - my only complaint about him is Voldemort's eyes weren't red, more blue to me. Not forgetting, the scenes with Moody at the end are also acted well on Radcliffe's and Brendan Gleeson's part.On a whole, I did enjoy the film and it was mostly worth my £5.50 ticket price, I only wish that the next film, Order of the Phoenix isn't as choppy and perhaps in the case of Goblet of Fire, a longer running time would have been better. As a Potter fan since 2004, I recommend the film for Potter and non-Potter fans.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
You will have to choose between what is easy and what is right,"Harry and his friends are now young ladies and gentlemen. An international Quidditch event is taking place. To get there one has to use a port key (an innocuous-looking device that transports one to a different location). Things did not go as well as planned and now a dark element has been added.Also, this year is the tri-wizard tournament in which a hero from each of three learning institutes must compete in unknown events. This is to promote friendship among the institutes. The opportunity is open to only potential contestants of seventeen years old. They must enter his/her name into the goblet of fire for selection. So, you can imagine everyone's surprise to find fourteen-year-old Harry's name in the Goblet. How did his name get in the goblet? Will Harry accept the challenge? And if so, how will he fair?We get to see all the characters for the book come to life. Most of the relevant story is included. Among the parts that were left out, I was hoping for the Blast-Ended Skrewts and the male wizard wearing the dress to get plenty of air around his private parts.The series of Harry films has also matured with each rendition. It took several tries, some better than others, but this one has the feel of the book and even with the short time it plays shows the real feel of the ongoing story of the struggle between Harry and he, who must not be named. This includes the larger picture of more than just good versus evil.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Best of the series.,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the darkest, most tragic Harry Potter movie yet, and it makes it all the more enjoyable. In this film, Harry finally meets Lord Voldemort face to face. I must say I was very pleased with this entry in the Harry Potter series. It was done just right. When Alfonso Cauron took over for Chris Colombus with the third film, he screwed up the style, but now Mike Newell brings the style back to its roots.As you would expect, a huge amount of the book has been cut out, but Mike Newell did a great job deciding what needed to stay, and what could go. He still makes a great film out of what he has. I was a bit disappointed that the Dursley's were cut out, but it's only a minor flaw.The performances, as always, are great. Brenden Gleeson is great as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, and Ralph Fiennes' three minute role as Lord Voldemort is well worth the wait. This is the perfect example of what a Harry Potter film should be.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Grossly overrated and needlessly  long this is only good in parts,"Judging by some of the reviews here you'd think this was a masterpiece though to be fair others tell it like it is. And I am coming to it cold without having read the book. There are good moments, especially the first half hour and the first contest but then the film flags dreadfully and never really recovers. Not only is each contest less exciting than the one before but there is an interminable sequence around the school ball which hammers the same point time after time after time: yes teenagers suffer social embarrassment and yes so do older folk but we don't need huge swathes of repetitive screen time to learn this again and again plus endless scenes of clichéd whimsy. This whole section could have come down to 10 minutes max (it feels like five time that length) and left more time for the story which is often confused and suffers weird time jumps.Also while the children/teens are good, some of the elderly British cast should be ashamed of themselves. Michael Gambon gives an utterly lifeless performance as Dumbledore ('Dumblebore' more like). It sounds like he doesn't believe a word of it. The report card for him as for the film? Could Do Better!",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Best Potter Movie of the Series,"This is the Potter movie that finally does justice to the book! Although several subplots were cut out, this movie still follows the 734 page book great! I saw this November 1st at a preview screening and wasn't expecting that great of a movie; boy was I wrong. This is by far the best movie in the series! It has great acting, great special effects, and a good plot (the best one in the book series). As for the pace of the movie, all I have to say is to be sure to be on time to the theater because this movie picks up right and the beginning and is a none stop roller-coaster ride. This movie mixes in humor very well for being the darkest one of the series, I often found myself laughing out loud at certain spots. Not to give anything away, but this movie is dark. If you are thinking of taking a young child, I would give you the advice that if they could handle the violence in Revenge of the Sith then they will have no problem at all with the violence/intense images in this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

"Harry Potter...More than a ""Children's"" Book","As a graduate student in education, I have found Harry Potter to be excellent pieces of literature to utilize in the study of different topics featured in social studies. Not only does Harry Potter provide teachers with suitable material to teach about discrimination (Civil Rights Movement), slavery (The Civil War), and genocide (Holocaust), but he also allows children to digest lofty concepts that would have traditionally been left to the college professors and adults.Critics of Harry Potter need to understand that JK Rowling did not create the series with the intention of keeping to the children's literature circuit. It is obvious, when studying the Harry Potter series that she had more than a simple story in mind. With her background in languages, she has developed a hero that is Christ-like, and a story that is more biblical than Christian nay-sayers would like to admit. To ignore the popularity of Harry Potter based solely on the ticket sales and its position on the best seller's list would be doing this incredible epic a disservice.I will forever defend Harry Potter (the books and the movies), because I have seen students who would never think of picking up a book, read during their lunch period while their friends socialized and gossiped...thanks to Harry Potter. Rowling has created a fantasy world worthy of Tolkien; her masterpieces must be recognized for the amazing educational value they hold for children and adults alike. To say they are ONLY for children defies what Rowling intended for her books to be...they are the books of our generation that will forever mark our society's history.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"If you have not read the book...not as easy to follow as the first 3, not as much depth to plot, not recommended as a first glimpse in Harry Potter line","A fan of the other HP movies, I am glad to have seen GoF on the big screen, even though for me it was not up to par with the first three. With cast and characters now cemented as familiar old friends, it was nice to visit them once again, and to see they have grown comfortably in acting skill.As a young adult, Ms Hermione Granger has blossomed from cute kid to beautiful young woman with sex appeal, though I feel a bit of a perv for pointing that out since I am considerably older. But the fact is that adding the dimension of young adulthood to all of the characters helps us more ripened folk stay attracted to the movie series, though one has to wonder if the next HP movie to follow will be the last for this soon to be over-the-pubescent-hill group of actors.Special effects in HP4 are possibly better in some respects than the first movies. Sadly, the spell that wore off on me is the plot which did not have the depth as the previous movies. This was an adventurous action romp unraveling the dreams(nightmares) of Harry as they entwined with ongoings at Hogwarts. Nothing wrong with that, however, the mystery element in the other HP movies offered more intrigue to keep my interest. The others had twists and curves and a moderately challenging mystery to solve. HP4 carried on more like an action/chase scene. One comment I've heard is that this movie was darker, and short on whimsy compared with the previous HP films. I didn't see that. Plenty of worthy whimsy in HP4 if you ask me, some a bit more sophisticated than the previous films.I did not read this book, nor any of the HP books (I can just imagine sitting at a coffee shop, at my well-seasoned age, whipping out a Harry Potter book), and this movie lost me at times, but not because it was too complex. It just seemed to have holes that only someone who had read the book could instinctively fill in.All-in-all a good movie worth seeing if you're a fan of the others, but not recommended to the uninitiated as a first foire in Harry Potter genre.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Fantastic!,"It is for sure, the best movie from the harry potter series as I speak this very moment.

The Tri-wizard tournament is awesome! It also looks very realistic if you tell me! It's just one big adventure, where you can really dig in to. And I understand why Harry falls in love with Cho Chang! She looks great! I can't wait to see harry potter 5, because it seems to me that every new book is even better than the previous one! Great job J.K. Rowling and all the actors and directors of the movies! I love Harry Potter!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Nothing spectacular,This film is a pretty straightforward adaption of the book. It doesn't do anything wrong but it doesn't inject much excitement or creativity either.

HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE keeps the flame burning,"The phenomenal success of J. K. Rowling's series of novels for children about a boy in a school of wizardry has been augmented by the enormous box office grosses of the film adaptations. Left with the daunting task of maintaining the standards and quality of the previous installments, Director Mike Newell has fashioned in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, a marvelous, visual treat that matches the series' previous highs.A new year at Hogwarts brings old faces and some new ones as the school for witchcraft and wizardry is primed for great change and a growing threat. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is shaken by a recurring nightmare as the presence of Lord Voldemort looms ominously, and he summons Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) for advice. Soon a mysterious man, ""Mad Eye' Moody (Brendan Gleeson), arrives to help Harry against the dark forces. The school is preparing for a special gathering of two other schools to compete in a special Tri-Wizard Tournament, a fierce and dangerous competition in which only one older student from each respective school may enter via the Goblet of Fire. Harry becomes involved in the competition to the surprise of everyone including himself. As he and the other students find, the games are immensely formidable with dragons, underwater traps, and an endless maze of hedges. Meanwhile, Harry, Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson) are experiencing the joys and pain of adolescence as the wonders of high school crushes and the anxiety of the school dance wreak havoc. Even Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) catches the romantic bug. Mistrust and accusations complicate matters for Harry, and Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) expresses his concerns about the future. Before long, Harry, Ron and Hermione bicker amongst themselves as their friendship is severely tested. When the tournament concludes, another set of tragic circumstances opens the way for new evil and betrayal. As the elder wizards (Gambon, Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman) close ranks to protect the students especially Harry, the future remains uncertain at best.Ironically, Mike Newell (Four Weddings and a Funeral) is the first British director of the series, and, while he had the difficult challenge of continuing the series, he has added some nice wrinkles and touches by delving deeper into the emotional conflicts of these students. In fact, the maturation and changes these teens must encounter richly add to the already exciting story. We root for these heroes and feel their discomfort and pain because we have in a sense grown up with them. As with any Harry Potter storyline, not all the characters are good and, conversely, not all the suspicious ones are bad. Several plot lines are carried over from the previous films and new ones are primed for future sequels. Screenwriter Steven Kloves, the keeper of the flame, has done a herculean job of distilling the essence of Rowling's novels into each film thus far.As always, the trio of young actors, Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint, own these roles, and the thought of replacing any of them due to age concerns was unnecessary. All three look great as they are now a little older and wiser. Of course, Gambon, Smith, Rickman, and Coltrane are the old pros who are the constants at Hogwarts. Ralph Fiennes is perfectly suited for his villainous turn in the startling climax. Brendan Gleeson does a fine job as the menacing, yet benevolent 'Mad Eye' Moody who supposedly watches over Harry during the tournament. It also seems that the most recent Harry Potter film is becoming quite an international event as the cast of students is even more ethnically diverse than ever before.As usual, the production values are outstanding with lavish sets and costumes imaginatively photographed by Roger Pratt. The special effects are quite impressive although nothing that you haven't already seen in the Lord of the Rings trilogy or the Star Wars sextet. Just the generous details and little touches throughout the film like the animated paintings add to the overall care that still goes into these films. Make no mistake, this is a lengthy film, but the pacing is good as a large number of scenes are strung back to back to contain as much of the book as possible into roughly two and a half hours. It feels a bit episodic but never loses sight of the main story and the emotional state of the characters.There are creepy images and a foreboding atmosphere through much of the film. This adaptation does contain more risqué scenes such as Harry's bathtub scene or the terrifying menace of Voldemort, in which the tone gets downright mean-spirited. The students are not so innocent anymore as they curse, and in one climactic scene come face to face with the pain of loss. A PG13 rating signals that the Potter adventures are growing up fast.It does require that the audience have a background in the series of books or films to fully appreciate the significance of critical events, although the film can stand on its own as pure entertainment and a coming of age. In some ways Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a classic bridge episode similar to The Empire Strikes Back. Not only is it a strong entry in the series with the most open ended finale yet, it proves a good setup for some potentially exciting things to come. Harry's next adventure can't come soon enough!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
An Outsider's Viewpoint,"When a film has a fan base or is based on a book, it is difficult to find reviews by people who are not part of that fan base and/or have not read the book. I am neither a fan of Harry Potter nor do I read the books, so some of you may find my review of interest in that respect. I am not going to summarize the plot; many other reviews already do that nicely. Instead, given that I have seen every Harry Potter film so far for one reason or another, I will focus on giving my basic opinions on the film and also comparing it to the previous films.This film seemed a bit darker than previous films. Almost every scene had an ominous weight to it. Yet in other places, like in the introduction of the all female troop, it felt downright silly, like Charlie and the Chocolate factory with the dancing midgets. Moreso than previous films, it had that kind of awkward clash in that it seems like a children's story attempting to be an adult story -- or vice versa -- I can't really figure it out. I think that would be my biggest reason for not being a Harry Potter fan. If they were to replace all the child wizards and adolescent behavior with adult wizards and behavior, I would probably like it a lot more.Many of the scenes seemed rushed. The film sometimes jumped too quickly from one scene to another. And there were characters who seemed out of place, like the seeker champion who was built up as if he was a main character, yet never seemed to fill that role. This is a difficult issue to address in such films that are based off of books, so you could say it is to be expected. However, the problem seemed a lot worse in the this film than in previous films.I got a little bored around the middle of the film and wasn't entirely satisfied when it ended. However, I was also feeling a bit tired at the time, so that probably didn't help. I thought the visuals in the film were very well done. Most of the sets felt real and created the ambiance that I think was both good and as intended. Overall, despite the drawbacks, I think it was a fairly decent film. However, I still don't understand the mass appeal of Harry Potter.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Not just a Harry Potter movie, fourth has true magic!","'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' is easily the best Harry Potter film to date. Action, suspense, drama, and even some touches of horror are all included in the darkest of the stories to be adapted yet. Not only is the film exciting for readers of the best-selling book series, but it also has potential to draw in non-readers who may not have enjoyed the first three films quite as much as other fans have.As a reader of the books, I was saddened at some of the scenes left out of the film. However, I can appreciate that the scenes left out were not as important to the main story. Other readers will complain about some of these scenes, but the film has enough to explain the story to those who have not yet read the books, while leaving enough out so that the film did not drag on too long.This movie was placed into the hands of director Mike Newell, and he did a wonderful job with it. The scenes play out as if you were reading the book, even if the dialogue is changed. He does not focus too long on the mundane or on backgrounds already seen several times. We've already seen the hallways with the moving stairs, so he doesn't worry about showing them again. It's the same for other locations. The rooms we see are the ones actually vital to what is happening in the story.The acting is nicely done. It's amazing to look especially at the three main kids, and compare them to where they were in the first Harry Potter film. Not only have they matured with age, but their acting has as well. Rather than seeming like they're trying to fit into the parts, it seems as if they truly are those characters. Daniel Radcliffe especially does a good job as Harry towards the end of the movie, as we build to the most climactic scenes.The film is so different from the first three, it is amazing. All four films hold the essence of the books, but this one has the most appeal to the viewers who have not read the books. The first two films tried to pack too much of the story in just to please the readers, and became a little too drawn out. The third film, well better done than the first two, seemed to lack a little more of the Potter essence, trying too hard to fit for non-readers. This film had the proper balance. Certain scenes in the film are longer than in the book, adding more action and suspense. While some readers may wonder at this, it adds more excitement for the casual viewer. And yet, at its core, the film has the true Harry Potter themes running true, even if it lacks some of the details.As compared to the previous Harry Potter films, this was the best so far, as previously stated. Yet looked at on its own, without comparison to the others, the film is still truly an outstanding piece of work. Rather than being compared solely to the others in the Harry Potter series, it has true magic that carries it into the realm of truly great fantasy films. It may not be entirely perfect, but the film still definitely deserves 9 stars, almost a 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
High On Action but low on Magic,"Harry Potter has begun his forth year at Hogwarts and I guess things change for him now that he has a crush! I have seen many times Harry and Hermione with each other. For instance, In The Sorcerer's Stone Harry and Hermione talk about nonsense then in The Chamber of Secrets, at the end, Hermione hugs Harry then in The Prisoner of Azkaban, They both hold each other(jeez!) at the end because of Proffesor Lupin but now it kind of reminds me that What are the directors trying to do? Make Harry and Hermione like each other till the Order of the Pheonix? That's a good sign. But still, the Goblet of Fire focuses on Harry getting a date! It is kind of stupid, but yes, I still think that some ugly bloke of a director will turn things upside down, hopefully.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the most boring films I have seen this year!,"I know I'm going to make loads of enemies by saying this but I just don't see why everyone is going nuts over this film. There are billions of biased Harry Potter lunatics out there who would give this film 10/10 before even seeing it, even if the director did nothing but wipe his ass on the celluloid. That isn't the case, but it's still one of the most boring films I've had to sit through in a long time.The books do not translate well to film. I know it's an old cliché that people always say about books into movies but it really does appropriately describe the world of Harry Potter. The books may be money-spinners but JK Rowling's universe is so dense and involving one can become immersed rather easily, which is one of the franchises major selling points. The films were put into pre-production before Warner fully understood how long or drawn-out Rowling stories would be. As a result they are forced to increasingly cut down on what they put up on screen. I found Prisoner of Azkaban to be anorexic compared to it's literary counterpart. Goblet of Fire goes even further and strips it right down to the bone.Director Mike Newell had the option of releasing the film in 2 separate volumes (ala Kill Bill) but his overconfidence got the better of him and he reckoned he could do a 500+ page book in a 157-minute film (with 12 of those minutes being credits). It doesn't work, I don't care what anyone says, the story is badly damaged by being whittled down to almost nothing. I'm not complaining at the lack of the Dursley's, I know they don't make or break the film. But important sub-plots and important characters are barely even featured.Harry's co-competitors in the Tri-Wizard Tournament, Viktor Krum and Fleur Delacour, are interesting and developed in the book. In this movie they are so absent you'd think they'd been completely cut out. I think I heard Krum speak once. And the British Tabloid press made a huge fuss (as they do with everything) over a girl from Fife being cast as Harry's would-be girlfriend Cho Chang. But she's in it for an absolute maximum of 2 minutes and has about 3 lines of dialogue! And what of this nonsense that Ron and Hermione are in love with each other? They have a single conversation in 157 minutes with no longing glances or butterflies in stomach or anything! Being jealous at each other dancing partners simply isn't enough. Also, many important plot developments that the film doesn't have time to linger on are given a single line of explanation and quickly forgotten as things move from A to B to C. For anyone who hasn't read the book this could be very disorientating and you'll probably get lost at some point.Keen to distract us from this Warner have chucked in a massive SFX budget in hope that lots of CGI will make us think the film really is amazing when it just plain ain't. How superficial can you get? I really don't think the kids will mind though. And the zombie parents dragged along with them won't care either. Those of us who are serious about films (people who go nuts over Harry Potter not included) will notice how plebeian the franchise has become.Mike Newell does chuck in a couple (only a couple) of nice shots but has this amateur theory that the darker the film looks the more sinister it will become. What nonsense! Much of this film is so poorly lit you'll struggle to see what is happening on screen. And the daytime scenes are all shot with an ugly green haze to make things look enchanting or spooky or something. It makes the film look stupid.Order of the Pheonix is up next. And that book was very, very long. How on earth they will fit that in a movie I don't know. Warner have seriously bitten off more than they can chew with this franchise. In the hands of a skilled director who is familiar with action, fantasy and even a touch of horror this could have been better. The director of Mona Lisa Smile and Four Weddings and Funeral is a totally inappropriate choice. For some reason John Williams has jumped ship and left scoring to duties to Patrick Doyle. But you'll hardly notice the difference. Doyle retains the Harry Potter theme and sticks to the loud, bombastic sound Williams used for action scenes in the previous films.I'm not a Harry Potter hater, no matter how negative my opinion sounds. But trying to talk sense into someone who loves these films no matter what is like trying to convince a Christian Fundamentalist that God doesn't exist. A rather extreme simile, but alarmingly appropriate.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Best Potter yet,"At least for me it was ... and I don't know jack about the book(s), so I can't tell you what's missing etc. etc. etc. But what I can tell you is that the direction has gone ""darker"". For a family friendly wizard, that is quite an accomplishment.By now (assuming you know the other movies and/or books) most of the characters have been established, with Sirius Black being one of my favorite, because Mr. Oldman can play ""against"" type (he's so often casted as a bad guy it's nice to see him play someone good for a change)! What's also nice is that you can see a development and a story continuation (although for some it might be too slow) ... but then again, it's all in the book(s), isn't it?

Enjoyable yet totally uneven,"Why did they release the ultimate Harry Potter film when it was so, not only unfinished, but bad.I could watch any of the Harry Potter films and be completely content and the same will probably go for this film, however I didn't find the latest Potter to be any better than the first two. Yes it was darker and it had a better story (but thats thanks to JK Rowling)so why did it go so wrong?It was unfaithful to the original book. They missed out a lot of detail that almost couldn't be missed out. They changed some of the events like Harry Vs the dragon and made illogical. They didn't even explain why the boys fell head over heel for Fleur. The film was a real disappointment as I thought it would be better than the last one which is still definitely the best.The one thing that really has to improve is Daniel Radcliffe. He is still bad if not worse than before and if he is going to be anything other than Harry Potter his acting has got to improve.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Simply Awesome...!!,"This one is undoubtedly The Best Harry Potter Movie. Director Mike Newell has done a great job in adding all the essential parts of the movie and crammed a 600 plus page novel into a 2 and a half hour movie. You really don't feel that anything is missing,cause you will be so much engrossed in the movie that you will not even realise what they left out. The chemistry between the main characters is brilliant, you can feel the ups and downs of the friendship between Harry and Ron, and also Ron and Hermioni. This is an ""edge of your seat"" movie. Its got great special effects, awesome story line(obviously)and all this just makes the movie....simply the best in the Harry Potter series.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The First Hp movie I've seen in theatres-wont be the last,"Well I have never considered myself a Harry Potter fan-at least not a ""real"" one. Up until a year ago-i wouldve equated by knowledge of Rowling's world with that of a muggle's. But a few months ago I picked up ""Philopher's Stone"" and read it. Then I read Chamber of Secrets. Eventually I went on to read all of the Harry Potter Books and have found (despite the fact they're clearly wrriten at an easily accessible reading level) they are quite enjoyable stories.Then I went on to watching the movies and although there are some differences i enjoyed them as well. This 4th installment is , in my humble opinion, the best Hp movie to date. The acting is better, the cinematography is darker, and i love Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemorte. They took a good action packed book and turned it into a good action packed movie. Also-I found quite a few parts of the movie to be pretty funny. I mean I never quite thought I would have found myself laughing at jokes in a Hp movie but there i was.The effects are top notch and Williams's score is as good as ever! Even if you are not an Hp fan-catch up on the storyline and check this movie out.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Harry gets even darker and deeper,"Rating-7/10Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire see's our young friend In his fourth year at Hogwarts, and very much in danger yet again. The movie is dark, slick and all together a new kind of Harry Potter which seems to take us in a new direction when it comes to Potter and wants us to feel much more dark but also more emotion. The film has thrills everywhere and the plot is pretty fun, it's not every film you get Dragons, huge hedges and Ron Weasley all rolled in one but this one makes us laugh or it did for me, and here below are my thoughts on the adventure.The plot isn't necessarily unique but still captures a certain imagination of thrilling chases, battles and teenage angst in which there is quite a bit. Yes this is truly the movie where Harry, Ron and Hermione start to realise they are becoming more mature and with that comes relationships etc which kind of intertwines with the more serious nature of the plot. On that point the serious side of the story, it is much darker than before, now Prisoner of Azkaban was possibly darker in the whole set up of the plot but this is a little darker throughout, gossip of Lord Voldemort growing in power and his gang of ""Death eaters"" stoke fear in our characters and even new additions to the teaching staff make Neville Longbottom wince.The film is pretty well cast, new additions a plenty especially with all the new schools we get to see. But for me the one best new face is Brendan Gleeson as Alastor Moody who just makes the film funny and not necessarily in a fun way, his mannerisms are second to none and his speedy eye makes the plot a little more interesting. Among the new young actors is Robert Pattinson who as new boy Cedric Diggory is good and appears alongside others such as Stanislav Ianevski(Victor Krum) and Clemence Poesy(Fleur Delacour) who make the cast a big one but a good one.Mike Newell is drafted in to direct this and although he isn't bad, I didn't like the way in which he did it. I just felt he sets it up in a way in which the actors can seem awkward and although he deals with the massive scenes involved, he doesn't get the dramatic side out until right at the end. With source material so huge, this is really the first big challenge that the series gets when adapting but I felt Steve Kloves adapts it well and Newell does it well enough to make this a very worthy addition to the franchise.Going into more technical terms it is filmed well, the design is nice and the entire look and feel is one the best of the movies now four in. With John Williams not scoring this movie you might not expect it to be as epic and although it does sound a little different to before, new man Patrick Doyle thumps this one out and in the process creates a really good score, that isn't afraid of going all blockbuster on the whole show. I felt even the special effects get driven up slightly from before, they improve in a way only hundreds of millions can do but in any case, good work.So Goblet of Fire keeps Harry Potter going on and really keeps it steady, not a better film than the previous instalment for me but oh so close though. Yes Daniel Radcliffe and co just have no signs of slowing down, and with the backing this franchise has there is no wonder people love these movies and the series as a whole, me included.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Beautiful,Masterfull,Exciting. the best yet!",This movie had everything a potter fan wanted and MORE. ah this new director hit it on the spot. the cinematography Amazing. The actors are brilliant. Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson SHINE in this movie. their acting has come a long way and this movie proves it. i recommend it to everyone. I'm going to see it again tonight. we need to make this one the best yet. its worth the 10$ to get in the 11$ to eat. the annoying people in the background! nope just kidding you guys. i wont post spoilers on here but i have to say robert patterson is amazing as cedric diggory and katie leung is wonderful as cho. all the haters you cant hate anymore shes brilliant.I was disappointed there was no Winky/Dobby elf interaction but this movie for its 2:30 min pulls in a great start and finish.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Don't See It,"Dear Harry Potter fans,The newest Harry Potter movie very roughly follows the book and has some really pretty scenes. The movie characters progress compared to the previous movies, they perform many of the same magic spells and feats in the books, and the scenes containing the feats are likable. You can enjoy this movie ... IF you are a Harry Potter fan and have done the following things:1. You HAVE read the fourth book but definitely NOT RECENTLY.2. You have given up trying to compare the books to the movies. The books are too delightful, too British (and would be well served to remain so and the American versions to regress a little), and develop the characters in a way that the movies simply can't or don't.3. You realize that Dumbledore in the books bears NO Resemblance to the movie version or even the actor playing him in the first two movies, AND you are not offended by this pathetic excuse for a replacement. In fact, the new Dumbledore is so bad that it might be better to ignore him altogether in the movies. Admittedly, he is slightly better in this film than the 3rd film but so many of his actions are completely uncharacteristic of my idea of Dumbledore (by the plot or the actor) that it is offensive. The Book Dumbledore was never rash (like grabbing Harry after the Goblet of Fire scene), accidental in any way, and didn't defer to Fudge or Barty Crouch for a rule interpretation or ""what to do next."" Also, I don't care what the screenwriters put in for this actor, he needs to take that rubberband off his beard.In summary:Don't see this movie if you haven't read the book. You won't follow it and you'll be better off reading it and waiting for video.If you have read the book, don't see this movie if you expect this to be anything except a visual replica of the prettier parts of the book.For me, I enjoyed this film because my standards are sooo low. The movie has divorced itself almost completely from the book and yet uses the book as a crutch to skip plot points, take out key characters, and jumble scenes together. The book is large, detailed, and wonderful so it is understandable that they couldn't get it all into the movie. However, the book and movies are now different entities. I may or may not see the 5th movie because I am curious where the movie characters go but any of the movies will never be as moving and heartfelt as any of the books. The movie characters are no longer even close to my mental image formed from the books. The 3rd movie cleaved my mental image in half, and the 4th movie simply echoes the lack of similarity. More than anything, it is this divorce that creates a difficult line to ride for the true Harry Potter fan who wishes to enjoy the movies.Good luck to you! I hope you enjoy it but you must have CONSTANT VIGILANCE to be a true fan of the movies. :-)Guy",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The perfect example to not make another Harry Potter movie,"I would vote 0 except it's not an option. OK, I know that it's necessary to cut out some of the book to keep the movie under 10 hours. After seeing this, though, I see the writers and director do not have the finesse required to make necessary cuts/changes and produce an even mediocre movie. The acting was the least believable that I've seen in a while (and that's including Zorro 2 by the way). No one made a dramatic pause or was able to say even a simple undramatic sentence without some huge physical gesture. Dumbledore's walking around the Goblet of Fire when the champions were announced reminded me of the Ferengi in an early episode of Star Trek the next generation where they were dodging around and growling for no apparent reason. The characters were mutilated beyond recognition (with the possible exception of Harry because they just can't do that), like Dumbledore being more of a hothead and forcing Harry back once his name is called instead of the serene scholar who cares about his students and would never do anything resembling manhandling them. Victor Krum reminded me of the roast ham at Thanksgiving dinner yesterday except the ham was smarter, better looking, and had more lines, a complete contrast from the star of Bulgaria Krum was in the books. I could go much farther in the intense hatred this movie has inspired in me but the box says I have a limit, so I'll wrap it up. The whole thing says ""OK this is something we're just churning out to make money off the quality books through name recognition, so we don't need to put any actual thought or effort into it.""",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
For some reason this is my favorite movie of the series.,"This movie is pretty bad. The acting and effects are worse than the previous movies. The plot is full of holes. The filler outweighs the story. Nearly every element falls apart when you try to apply logic to what's happening. Yes, this movie is entertaining. Yes, this movie is stupid. I'd only recommend watching this movie if you are already invested in the series.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The best so far...,"I am happy to say that the Goblet of Fire truly made up for the disastrous Prizoner of Azkaban. Mike Newell brilliantly guided the cast into a realm that no other Potter movie has been. There was a new level of chemistry among the acting group, which made me love them all the more.I will say that the limited involvement of Dumbledore was a wise move. Michael Gambon did a horrible job as Dumbledore. His acting was very contradictory to the typical demeanor of the Dumbledore we have all gotten to know and love. What I saw was not the temperate and amiable wizard Rowling created. Rather he was a bellowing man who normally would make Harry apprehensive to approach or trust with his concerns.Overall, though, the movie was the best so far and I can only hope that the next will be even better.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Why buy the hype ?,"HPGOF - being a avid listener of the unabridged books read by Mr. Dale,I believe the movies are a disappointment and a way to make more money off the stories. I am not criticizing the work done to create the films, but what has HP become ? Each one of the books has critical character development and story line complexity that is is sorely missing from the movies. I have to wonder if JKR really has 100% creative control. If the movies are a ""coming alive"" version of the books, than why does JKR spend so much time in character development in the books, just to have it lost ? why doesn't she just write the screen play for her last book instead. I found the rewriting of the GOF to fit a movie, just an disservice to JKR work. One change that works for GOF is Nevel's role. But that was done to eliminate Dobbie's appearance in the movie. Nevel's role was better in the book with the finding out about his parents and their fight with Voldemorte. He is a character, not a device to move the plot. In retrospect, I think a mini series done for TV with all the details would have been a tribute to JKR than the way these films are butchering HP.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
I couldn't make up my mind,"I went to see the fourth harry potter movie yesterday and i found it rather intriguing. I am a harry potter's books fan and i was very disappointed at the fact that Winkie never showed up, the fact that important explanations were missing and personal relationships poorly explored. All I got from the movie, let's say 80%, was action, the tournament occupies the screen for most of the time. But, and there is always a but, the scenes that were filmed were great, flawless, powerful. Newel made a great job, but i must say that the script could have been better. Rupert is great as Ron and Emma was a surprise, as for Daniel.. he grew up..as an actor and as a boy. I believe that the actress casted as Fleur could be more magnetic, i couldn't see none of the Veela's blood in her, except for the fact that she is blond... It was in my opinion the best HP movie... but I considered it a high treason to the book. As I say... I couldn't make up my mind...",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The weakest of the Harry Potter films but still entertaining,"I thought the original novel to Goblet of Fire was a little underwhelming but it was still fun. That Quidditch match at the beginning of the novel seemed unnecessary and the film cut out the Dursley scenes completely. But here we get the comeback of a certain wizard and Harry's role in the battles to come. The special effects were well done and there was a lot cut out but it did its job. Some might like this better than the novel because it's more condensed. But you be the judge. As for me, I can't decide which is better; they're both good, the novel and the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Goblet of Fire - Not for the kids!!!!,"I went to see goblet of Fire on a Sunday afternoon...subsequently there were many kids with parents, some as young as (I guess) 5 or 6....for anyone thats seen the film, you will understand why the line of children on my row persisted to cry many times throughout the film, and two others were removed with parents in tow due to them being scared!!!! Although the books are portrayed as children's books, the film versions are a different story.However, I thoroughly enjoyed it..as I have the others. There are some issues with some of the younger actors, but these 'imperfections' have grown on me and have now become part of the film.Although I thought the 'new' Dumbledore has done a good job considering the actor he had taken over from...I did prefer the original portrayal of the boss man. He was very regal and commanding, with obvious respect from everyone around him. The new one on the other hand is quite scatty and wired, which is not how I imagine Dumbledore to be.I haven't read the book since it first came out, so my memory of the story was quite poor. This was intentional as I was fully prepared for the film to deviate from the book.. It does stick to the story well, but there is so much that is rushed or missed out completely, that I would have liked it to either be split into a two part film, or made longer. With the age limit becoming higher, I see no reason why the duration cannot be lengthened to do the story justice.But when all is said and done, I can't wait for the next one!!!!

"Far Better than 1, 2, and 3","This was fantastic compared to the first three Harry Potter movies. Those I just hated (especially the third one; Cuaron did a terrible job), but this was amazing.The movie took out quite a bit from the book, but they took out parts that didn't matter all that much, aside from S.P.E.W and the House Elves, as well as Harry in the maze (talking to the Sphinx and what-not).The special effects were incredible. The dragon looked real, and so did that spider in Moody's classroom.The acting has far improved since the first one, and the actors actually do look around fourteen. I'm a teen, and that's what someone between 14-16 looks like. The only actor I still dislike is Michael Gambon as Dumbledore, and that's probably because I was so partial to the old one, who sadly died. My favorite is definitely is the woman who plays McGonagall.The only reason this movie bothered me was because they didn't do a good job at explaining the end. So much happens to set up the fourth book that they just took out of the movie.Other than that, Mike Newell is the best director thus far.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Detention for Mr. Newell for the lack of Plagiarism.,"This film was directed by Mike Newell, of Four Wedding's and a Funeral (1994), and Pushing Tin (1999) fame. Here we see his interpretation of J.K. Rowling's novel The Goblet of Fire. His career mainly consists of T.V. Direction, since 1964, and a smattering of movies.Plagiarism isn't the order of the day here, which is a pity, because if you are going to sell the book rights to the movie industry, then we would hope that it would or should, at least, stick to the original story. As naive as it sound's.This is the poorest of the four Potter movies so far. The story was non-existent, the character development was extremely shallow and the overall content was less than mediocre to say the least.The plot being that He who shall not be named comes back, again, to wreak havoc, almost. This only occurs during the final half hour or so. While the rest of the movie, the whole film being around two hours and forty minutes long, fair enough, is based on a tournament that contains three dangerous tasks. The conclusion at the end of the final task is that Harry unwittingly becomes His prisoner, here we go again. Thus ending in a show down, a very quick and positively anti climatic show down, a little like the first movie.The ending came a little too sudden, which seems a wasted opportunity considering the length of this movie, and because of the lack of build up, the final show down was neither exiting nor worthy off a movie of this stature.Apart from the shots of the Quidditch World Cup games at the beginning of the film, the hapless gang of three never leave the school grounds during the entire movie. This makes for a very stale and drawn-out plot. The sense of magic, meaning Wizards, Witches, Wands and Broomsticks etc, is lost in this over produced eye candy. There is a little too much distraction with what seem in places, unnecessary digital effects, which weakens the plot by substituting substance over effect.This movie (concept) has grown up since its birth, but as it has grown older, it has, like most healthy teenagers, become lost in its own World, thus needing a guiding hand or wand if you wish, to point it back in the right direction.Go to the top of the class for effort Mr Newell, but expect very little marks for content.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Decent, but misses a lot","This is a very good movie, but it misses a lot of the story line. This is understandable, however, because the book is very long and if shot accurately to the book, the film would be 5 or 6 hours long. However, it is a big disadvantage because it is quite confusing. I only understood because I read the book, but for someone who had not read the book, this film could easily be very confusing. The directing is good and there is a good mix of thrills, more sinister bits, and comedy. Some of the bigger scenes are breathtaking, such as at the quidditch world cup. Sadly the actual game is completely cut, and this is very disappointing. The film does contain a lot of scarier moments, and does deserve its 12A certificate. However, the very end is quite disappointing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Decent, but not overwhelming","I can't say I was overwhelmed. I will emphasise this isn't a bad film, but it didn't blow me away; at best it succeeds in being slightly better than average. The roots of this film obviously lie much more in the previous film than the first two; this is defiantly a good thing, it reflects the changing tone of the book towards more sinister overtones. The castle is shrouded in dark clouds, 'Dark and difficult times lie ahead', indeed.Acting from the British greats is as to be expected, spectacular performances from almost all; notably that of recent addition to cast Ralph Fiennes. There is defiantly a lack of screen time for many of the Hogwarts teaching staff, the film largely revolves around the kids; much more so than previous films. This is both a good and bad thing, it keeps the plot moving at a far whack and gives us more time to engage with our protagonists. However it limits our absorption into the world, it chips away at those things that enrich the Potter world. One last comment is on the performance of Alan Rickman (as Snape) which seems slightly uneasy, I can't explain why but the limited encounters with him just seem somehow off.The acting of child actors is, as always, the contentious issue. I share the same concerns many have expressed over the casting of Radcliffe as Potter, the simple fact is that he is failing to develop as an actor. This becomes increasingly evident as the performances of Gint (Ron) and Watson (Hermione) improve. Gint is worthy of particular mention here as his performance best embodies that which I would like to see from the others, he is beginning to show the signs of a mature actor. Watson is competent enough but does not, to me, embody the true spirit of Hermonie. An IMDb.com quote attributed to her reflects the character as 'snotty, bossy and posh', as a reader of the books this goes against the characteristics I have interpreted from the character.The plot, as I have mentioned, lacks background substance but it works hard on keeping momentum in presenting its core material, the events of the 'Tri-Wizard tournament'. It does this with substantial flair, the effects surpass expectations and fit neatly in with the already established Potter movie imagery. All the core plot elements are there and while the pace is hurried the flow of the film is maintained admirably.All things considered this is not a bad film, certainly one that is worth watching; but perhaps just the once. Therein lies its killer flaw, the film is merely a competent representation of the universe keeping continuity with the themes laid out in previous movies. The film certainly attempts at showing both the epic (the tournament) and the personal (the newly discovered romantic feelings of the protagonists), but the two are not so neatly interwoven. I walked away from the film with an impression of missing depth, we got to learn much about the Harry and friends, but other characters are not so neatly cut out. With the movie pushing the roles of new characters Cho Chang and Cedric Diggory; the old, such as Draco and Mrs. Weasly, are rather mercilessly cast aside. They are are almost certainly conspicuous by their absence.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
It Disapoints,"Can't they keep the characters the same from one film to another? A gruff Dumbledore, joking McGonagall, and the Three Kids have been washed down to be just silly. Maybe it's the English Humor coming from the new director. This film is too far a field from the others for me. I know... Take it on it's own merits. But there must be some kind of through line between them all, don't you think? Each film can't be shifted so drastically from one set of characters and Hogwarts settings to another! This movie is almost like it was made in a parallel universe/sound stage! Maybe I'm missing something. And don't EVEN get me started on the music!",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

I would go back and see it a thousand times. people were cheering with joy after the movie was finished. this movie touched every emotion, as it should have.

"OK MOVIE movie, less so for lovers of literate film","I went with high expectations to the new Harry Potter on its second night with a NON-Potter fan. As my friend observed (having only seen the thickness of the book, not having read it), to film a book that thick you HAVE to condense - but the condensation was so extreme I was concerned that anyone who had not read the book going in couldn't FOLLOW what was happening in the movie.It turned out as the first Potter film my friend LIKED.The first two films (""The Sorcerer's Stone"" - ""PHILOSOPHER'S Stone"" outside the United States where they don't underestimate the intelligence of their audience - or how many of us learned about the Philosopher's Stone in old Donald Duck comic books! and ""Chamber of Secrets"") were absolute models of FAITHFUL translations of terrific books to screen - a template for how ALL classic (or at least popular) books should be filmed.The last one (""Prisoner of Azkaban"") wasn't nearly as successful artistically, changing the tone (without good reason - frequently diminishing the potential ""cinematic"" power) and the letter of the best book in the series - and diminishing some of the best pseudo-science fiction overtones. It was distorted by a MOVIE-movie director who acknowledged who didn't WANT to film the BOOK, but make a movie with his own stamp on it (God protect movies drawn from good SOURCES from directors like that!).Thankfully, Rowlings and the studio stepped in to protect their franchise and insist that some major plot points essential for later developments of the story COULD NOT BE CHANGED. The film succeeded financially, and for the most part artistically, but it worried me how many of the reviews praising this one said nice things about the LAST one. I was right to be worried.While getting a new director who supposedly promised to be more faithful (a promise not notably kept), he retained some of the worst revisions in visual tone (NOT necessary for the ""darker"" story) imposed on ""The Prisoner of Azkaban.""Recognizing that as the books get thicker MORE omissions are inevitable, I actually enjoyed this one more, but was still disappointed that several essential visuals from the book (like the LOOK of the use of the ""flue network"" for communication) were thrown out in favor of less effective but more expensive ""special effects"" simply to call attention to themselves.Yes, massive details, setups and MOTIVATIONS from the book (MOST of the Quiddich World Cup, Ron's admiration one of the players - later to be rethought - and Fred & George's build up for their joke shop - important in the next book/movie, ""Order of the Phoenix"") frequently entire characters, some of them who will be important in later books, were eliminated (the Dursleys, ALL the ""house elves,"" a member of the Ministry of Magic and Ron's elder brother Percy, beginning a climb for weaselly power in the Ministry and most of the rest of the family; the dastardly Rita Skeeter remains as barely an afterthought). Most of these however don't hurt the story (yet), but to toss out the plot specific PERSPECTIVE from which Harry's dreams were seen does. It makes one wonder if part of the director's problem was that he didn't actually READ the book, just the ""treatment.""Often these eliminations were in favor of flavorless insertions (for no discernible reason other than justifying the ""screenwriter"" credit - like the desultory ""dance lesson""), but occasionally to give MORE screen time to characters who merited it and were being stiffed by elisions elsewhere (Cedric Diggery and especially the increasingly interesting and well played Neville Longbottom).Also on the good side, while having far less impact than in the book, is Emma Watson's Hermione Granger. Always a firm natural actress, Ms. Watson is developing into a positive beauty who should have a grand post-Potter career.Ralph Feines is going to be a FINE Voldemort, but throwing out much of J.K. Rowlings' actual plot specific description of details of his face seems a VERY lame make-up artist's conceit rather than inspiration. Michael Gambon (still unevenly filmed in this outing) is slowly growing into the role defined by the late Richard Harris, but his make-up artists are going to HAVE to get his hair and beard back to a purer white before the 6th and 7th films rather than the hideous rat color they've been effecting so far.I came away from the film having enjoyed it but being honestly unexcited by it, as I had been by the first two. The over-long first ""Challenge"" was an exciting spectacle, but a SEVERE and illogical disappointment compared to the dazzling and highly cinematic work in the book which was FOCUSED and didn't have to roam all over the countryside, destroying castle roofs and ignoring the POINT of the challenge to BE so. The deletion almost entirely of the exciting SCORING of the three challenges or the work of virtually anyone but Harry IN them, removed most of the real interest. The final challenge bears little resemblance to the one in the book and almost none of its excitement or interest.At the same time, it looks like the film will be SO successful, someday we may actually get the HBO (or some such) miniseries actually DOING the books as written ala the several BBC Sherlock Holmes series or HBO's (sadly historically revisionist) ROME. I guess I'm happy for that - and that to the extent the film excites some illiterate MOVIE people to READ the source they've got wonderful surprises in store for them.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Potter films just keep getting better!,"After hearing that the massive Harry Potter and the Goblet Of Fire book was only going to be made into one film, i did not have high expectations of it.However when i went to the midnight showing of the film on the 18th of Novemeber i was completely amazed at not only the film but the acting quality that shined through. Daniel Radcliffe gives his best and most convincing performance yet and i was deeply moved at his emotional scene when he returned Cedric's body back to Hogwarts. Rupert Grint was fantastic as a moody teenager dealing with jealousy and Emma Watson deserves ten out of ten for her performance of Hermione.This film is definitely not one to miss! Ralph Finnes gives such a brilliantly dark entrance to Lord Voldemort returning to power and played the character as sinisterly as J.K. Rowling describes him in the book. And of course we can not forget the forever building romantic chemistry between Ron and Hermione.

The first Potter-film to reach the quality of the book!,"When I went into the cinema to watch ""Goblet"" I was a bit scared. Everything they wrote in the German newspapers was not at all positive. And I couldn't really imagine Mike Newell directing a Potter-movie. But from the first seconds of the film to the last letter of the credits it was just unbelievably breath-taking. Newell created a completely new Harry Potter. The first two movies were very typical fantasy-adventures. The third one was just dark and sad. But ""Goblet"" is a perfect mixture of humour, teenage-conflicts, but also action and thrilling scenes. I was also delighted to see that the acting-skills of the trio improved dramatically. They took the step from child to adult. Same did the entire movie. ""Goblet"" is no fairy tale any more and deserves the rating PG13. The last thing that remains is the soundtrack. I was shocked at first when I heard, that John Williams wouldn't write this one. But once again I was positively surprised. The important themes of the previous 3 films remained, but there are many new elements. And they are just.... good! The only negative fact to mention is that some scenes are rather short. That's why I rate this film with 9.5 out of 10 points. I am delighted to say that a Potter-film finally reached the level of the books!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"This is a significant turning point in the series, when the subject matter becomes more mature and intense.","The Triwizard Tournament brings dangerous challenges to the plot, and the competition between the schools of magic adds interesting cross-cultural accents. The effects and staging of the dragon scene are impressive, and the maze and water challenge keep you on your toes. The cast is especially worthy of praise: Daniel Radcliffe perfectly conveys Harry's emotions when he is forced to face his first serious challenges and even the death of a friend. The movie also delves into the theme of darkness returning with Voldemort, which adds a menacing tone that shapes the seriousness of the following parts. The only thing that sometimes feels like a drawback is the need to cut certain elements of the book, which could have made some points more complete for those who know the material in detail. Overall, however, Goblet of Fire is one of the best movies in the series, getting a 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The best of them all,"I was watching this movie for 2 and a half hours and never got bored. Spread the word. This is the best harry potter movie yet made. Mad Eye Moody was great. There were rarely any flaws, except for minor changes from the book to the movie. This is by far the best acting by the three stars and the rest of the cast. I do think Richard Harris is a better Dumbledore, but Michael Gambon is a pretty good back up. Hagrid is funny, but he is maybe not shown enough. BUT WHO CARES!!! Me and my friends adored this film. I am going back tomorrow. I think Newell is a great advancement in the directing field. I hope he stays on for the Order of the Phoenix and Half-Blood Prince, and even number 7.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
poor as per usual,"harry potter once again failed to live up to the books! the world cup match should have been an amazing thrill ride and was let down by the fact that it was more or less cut out. sections were cut that shouldn't have been and bits extended that shouldn't have been. also if you hadn't read the books you could quite easily have been confused by this film...once again it was a Hollywood blockbuster filled with crap and really poor acting. Ralph Vines Valdamort was terrible he was not even scary. I'm sorry to say but four the forth time i have been let down by people making the same mistakes. I'm sorry but even J.K.Rowling will be let down by something that could have been brilliant, also where were half the characters this time, just because you got the three mains doesn't mean the rest go out the window! DID you even read the books! i have to say i am upset that there was no ludo bagman no winky no dobby no bill or Charlie no durslys no Mrs weasly very little serious no buck beak, what about Rita skitters ending? i pretty sure she was a bigger character, dumbeldore was really poor...there was no hogmede trips does ginny ever speak? and I'm sorry but get someone who can act to play harry and hermione, ill say this though Ron wasn't bad and the best bit was when Ron told harry to ""p*** off"" i can no believe you let me down again! who ever wrote this film adaptation should not work in films again!",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The best since Sorcerer's Stone,"Goblet Of Fire is the fourth installment in the popular Harry Potter series, about a British boy wizard named (what else?) Harry Potter who attends the Hogwarts School Of Witchcraft And Wizardry with his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.This time around, in his fourth year, Harry's been plagued by a terrible recurring nightmare of the Dark Lord Voldemort, his mousy, cowardly servant Peter ""Wormtail"" Pettigrew, and a mysterious young man whom Harry has never met, all gathered in an abandoned old house, plotting the downfall of ""The Boy Who Lived"".But these dreams are not all that Harry has to contend with. A fierce competition known as The Triwizard Tournament is being held at Hogwarts, with students from two other magical schools visiting. One student from each school over seventeen has the option to submit their name to the Goblet Of Fire, which will choose the competitors who will compete in a series of terrifying, potentially lethal magical tasks. Harry is more than happy to sit back and let others be the hero for a change, but someone else apparently has other plans. Harry is shocked and terrified when his name, which he had NEVER submitted in the first place, is selected by the Goblet as the FOURTH Triwizard Champion. The Goblet Of Fire, however, constitutes a binding magical contract, and Harry is forced to compete, despite being three years underage, and far less experienced than his opponents. While many of his classmates think Harry is just trying to get more fame and glory, Harry doesn't want any of this, and must rely on his closest friends and talents if he is to survive. Little does Harry know that a shocking twist of events will lead him straight into Voldemort's trap for the showdown of a lifetime.Many new characters show up this year, including Harry's first crush, Cho Chang, the troublesome yellow journalist Rita Skeeter, the mysterious Durmstrang Headmaster, Igor Karkaroff, the absolutely gigantic Headmistress of Bueaxbatons and Hagrid's love interest, Madame Maxine, Hogwart's creepy, but lovable new Defense Against The Dark arts teacher Alastor Moody, and the cold as stone politician who is said to have once sent his own son to Azkaban, Barty Crouch. We also have the other three Triwizard Champions, Hogwarts own Cedric Diggory, the french heart breaker Fleur Delacour, and the young Bulgarian Quidditch Champion, Victor Krum.Returning characters include the terminally-depressed girl ghost who lives in a toilet, Moaning Myrtle, Hogwarts sinister potions teacher who loathes Harry, Severus Snape, the stern but kindly Deputy Headmistress, Professor McGonagall, and Hogwarts Headmaster, Albus Dumbledore, who is beginning to show his human side in his obvious terror for Harry's safety.The trio has all improved greatly since the original film, and Daniel Radcliffe in particular does a fantastic job crying in one very emotional scene near the end. He is also very believable as a boy who is sick of being the hero and just wants to relax and be a normal kid. You see his stress and anxiety as he struggles to cope with the Tournament, which he never wanted any part of in the first place. He is only fourteen, yet you see him try to cope with his emotions and get through the tasks unscathed.The adult actors are all terrific as well, with Ralph Fiennes and Jason Isaacs as villains, Timothy Spall as a cowardly servant of the Dark Lord, and David Tennant as a crazed madman. Alan Rickman is wonderful as always as the detestable Professor Snape. Brendan Gleeson turns in the best performance of all, however, as the paranoid, intimidating, but lovable new professor who devotes his time to helping Harry survive the perils of the Tournament.Overall, Goblet Of Fire is the BEST Harry Potter movie since Sorcerer's Stone. Sure, there are quite a few things cut out, but you have to face that the book is HUGE and in order to make a movie of acceptable length, certain things had to go. It doesn't make the movie confusing. Even a non-reader will understand what's going on if he/she PAYS ATTENTION. But I do suggest a second viewing to grasp all of the subtle clues that you may have missed the first time around. Each Harry Potter movie, is, in a sense, a brilliant adventure/mystery with clues strewn through the movie for you to pick up on.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Better than the Book!,"Wow, I loved the movie! It was so exciting and a real feat in terms of condensing things but making it still understandable to the audience. And I was thinking, yes! that was how Rowling should have done the book. The book contained a lot of flab-- it takes them how many pages to get to Hogwarts? As happens when a writer (director or anyone else) gets so successful they feel they don't have to listen to an editor. The Harry Potter and Cho thing was actually done much more believably in the movie. Lots of people told me the movie was really dark and scary but I actually think the last one was more disturbing with the Dementors. I actually found the filmed scene of the graveyard part not as disturbing as it was in the book. In the book Voldemort comes off as this gross bloody fetus thing and Wormtail hacking his arm off...I liked how it was down in a fairly non-freaky way in the movie. I still think Rowling kind of has trouble making the love stuff not come off cliché in the Potter books. I think Mike Newell did an excellent job with the actors. I've been keeping my eye on him since his early BBC stuff and he seems to strike the perfect balance in tone with the movie that I think works really well. Alan Rickman was absolute perfection as always of course! Loved the bathtub scene...heheh something for the girls at last and all the inuendo and humor. Definitely captured the humor of the books. (Too bad that element has been getting a little lost of late). The dark mark thing-- I always thought it would look more like a brand than a tattoo. The maze could have been cooler as well.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
THIS movie was a let down.,A was of money. I never have been so let down in a movie. Without the special effects this movie would have tanked. The story line changed so much from the book. Facts in which were crucial to the story line were changed. Some of the best information from the book was completely left out in the movie. If you haven't seen this movie yet don't bother. I am almost sorry to say you should rent it but you know save money get it from a friend. Terrible if the books were anything like this movie no one would know what harry potter is. The best part of this movie is the special effects. For all you active harry potter fans lets pray that the next movie sticks to the facts.,6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.. the return of Voldemort,"I personally loved this movie. Although it seriously managed to miss important points in the book, it got the basic necessities of the book across to its viewers. The art department was absolutely fantastic in this film. They should really have gotten more credit for the brilliant work that they did for this movie. All the scenes for the tasks were just incredible and exactly how I imagined them in the book. The creatures were just absolutely phenomenal in this film. The actors delivered their parts with so much improvement and though the movie constantly had dark elements in it, Mike Newell managed to create humor throughout the movie as well. Absolutely brilliant. Well done.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Goblet of Fire best of the Potters,As of last night I have seen Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire twice! I have to say that I was a little scared to see this film because of the fact that they (the screenwriters) had to cut down an enormous book into a very short script. Well they did it. The movie is absolutely amazing! Steven Kloves did such a great job adapting the book to the film. As of now the Goblet of Fire is by far the best Potter film released: the acting was very well done by the main trio and as well as the adult cast (Snape was particularly humorous) and the way the Mike Newell brought his experiences to the movie was amazing. It is certainly a lot darker in this film and I loved it. All in all a must see by any fan of the book!,9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A true family thriller,"This movie is truly enjoyable. I have seen it twice (yes, I am a Potter fanatic, so I might be more than a little biased.) However, both time I seen this film the entirely audience had an excellent time. Parents were not bored, and enjoyed some humor and a truly interesting plot. Children had some jokes placed in the film for them, along with some amazing visuals for everyone. Two small children did cry during the appearance of Lord Voldemort, but this film is not to violent for most children over the age of 5. Fans of the series will be delighted by some small touches placed n it just for them, and people who are not fans of the series will still be given a cinematic treat.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"So many good things, but some very important factors left out","Overall, I believe this was a good movie and a fair addition to the Harry Potter series, but there were things the screenwriter and director totally missed out on that really ought to have been included.I can understand leaving out the Dursleys, Ludo Bagman and SPEW, and maybe even Molly Weasley, but poor Alan Rickman was left with so little to do with his character in this one that by the time he becomes a truly essential character in the fifth movie, they're going to have to explain so much that he's almost going to seem really random. The realization that Snape is a Death Eater was an eye opener in the book, yet here it is almost like, ""Oh yeah, by the way..."" It's almost as though they do not know what to do with his character, and he's probably the most important one outside of the trio. Another thing that really was done horribly was the ending. The viewer was left with the feeling that Barty Crouch Jr. is going to come back, when in reality he's supposed to be dead. Are they going to just to add his death into the very beginning of movie five, or what? They also skipped out on Fudge's scene at the end, which is a terrible shame because Robert Hardy could have done that scene brilliantly. The film seemed very jumpy and incoherent in other spots as well. The best example I can give of this is Hermione and Ron's confrontation at the Yule Ball, and then in the next scene they're best friends again without any real explanation as to how they made up.However, despite these problems, there were many things done well. The trial scene (with the exception knowing Snape is a Death Eater), was really well done and the Unforgivable Curse scene was a lot darker (very appropriately) than in the film. The tasks were all done well, especially the underwater scene. The best scene though (the most anticipated, in my opinion) was the graveyard scene. Ralph Fiennes was chillingly awesome as Voldemort. The priori incantatem was done perfectly and the Death Eaters were maliciously frightening (though I think the budget could have handled a larger hood for Lucius Malfoy).The acting is better in this one. Katie Leung was fine as Cho (though her character, thank goodness, was not all that big), and yes, she was pretty enough for the part. Stanislav, Fleur and Robert were good as the the other champions, though Krum and Fleur did not get to say much. Hagrid and Madame Maxime's scenes were cute, Brendan Gleeson played a very believable Mad-Eye, Rita Skeeter was played to the hilt by Miranda Richardson, and Dumbledore was not as hyper as he seemed in the trailers. McGonagall had a larger role in this film, but sadly Snape had nothing to do, Narcissa Malfoy did not make an appearance (which will make her seem very random in movie six), same with the Lestranges. As far as the trio, Harry's acting has improved substantially since ""He was their friend"", Ron plays it about the same, and Hermione is gradually weakening with her overblown emotions. Her line at the end nearly killed the movie, but I suppose that wasn't her fault she had to say it. The new music was good as well.Overall, a 7 out of 10, and I'm being generous. Taken as a movie, it is okay, and the art direction, cinematography and etc. are all great, but the character development is weak. Had the movie been just even twenty minutes longer, it could have been better. Definitely not a contender for best adapted screenplay at the Oscars, that's for sure.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Such a HUGE step up from godawful Prisoner of Azkaban it's not even funny.,"After the series low of the previous film, AKA the snoozefest mess Prisoner of Azkaban, it was good to see a mature Harry Potter film with an actual coherent/enjoyable story.This thankfully was an actual decent entry in the franchise, and I truly hope (pray) that David Yates' directing style and skill level has a ton more in common with Mike Newell and Chris Columbus than it does with the laughably overrated guy who directed the beyond boring slog that was Gravity and the single worst Harry Potter film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"disappointing, for different reasons","Many reviewers and message board users have mentioned that this movie was disappointing to avid fans of the books, and the defendants claim that the book had to be cut and we fans shouldn't expect for every little subplot to be mentioned. I felt, however, that the movie was disappointing *not* for what it left out, but for what it put into the film.Newell can be excused for cutting many things, especially since he really did a laudable job of altering the plot in most places to fit the edits. What bothered me was the addition of longer sequences. The first task is beyond drawn out, especially since the whole idea in the book (and somehow also in the movie) was that he performed so ludicrously well on it that he wasn't worried about the second task until later.Then there was the campiness. This should not have been a campy film.But worst of all the offenses were the changes in characters' personalities. Dumbledore, like it or not, comes off as mean-spirited in this film, and pushes the line between roughness and assault. Ron comes off more as an idiot than just deeply jealous. Professor McGonagall is made a mockery. Then again, Professor Snape is almost... likable. There is something severely wrong with this.Additionally, it lacks clarity of vision. Where the director chooses to leave out some minor bits of dialogue that would have made other parts of the movie more clearly relevant and understandable, he leaves in other parts that could have easily been removed, leaving the film feeling disjointed and, inexplicably given its running time, hurried.My list of gripes goes on further, but these were the worst grievances done to fans, not only of the books but also of the movies. Far from the best movie of the series, it was still a decent enough movie if you avoid reading the book beforehand and can get over the fact that your eyes remain dry at the end.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A darker but marvelous fourth chapter to the incredible saga...,"Harry Potter(Daniel Radcliffe), Hermione(Emma Watson), and the Weaselys attend the Quidditch world cup over their summer break, but it is terrorized my a large amount of Death-Eaters shortly after the match, showing signs of Voldemort's loyalty.After the Qudditch World Cup, they return to Hogwarts to find that Hogwarts is hosting the Tri-Wizard Tournament, in which three schools compete for the Tri-Wizard cup. One student from each school will be chosen from the Goblet of Fire, but you must be 17 or older to enter. Mireacously, Harry finds himself the fourth champion selected and becomes hated by many because the widely spread belief of cheating on his part. As if he doesn't have enough problems with his friends, a nasty reporter, and vicious dreams involving Voldemort, Harry finds himself battling dragons, solving puzzles, and dealing with sea creatures in the name of ""Eternal Glory"".Let me start my review by saying that The Goblet of Fire is a personal favorite for me, so I most certainly viewed this forth film with extremely high expectations.Being the forth film to the saga, and third director used, ""Goblet of Fire"" shines brighter than any other of the Harry Potter films, or shall I say ""darker"". If you thought that the previous Harry Potter film (Prisoner of Azkaban) was dark, then you are in for a treat. This is by far one of the darkest family films I have ever seen, but it most certainly impressed me. Vicious, bloody battles are scattered throughout the Tri-Wizard tournament along with wonderful acting on the part of Daniel Radcliffe, who I am starting to find more talented with each movie. The brutality of this film was so much more than the previous three, that it might be hard for parents to enjoy as much with their kids. The film is definitely more clever and humorous at certain points, but can get extremely intense and dark. The one single aspect of the film that I can see fans having a problem with is the way the movie flowed and their choices of what scenes to use or not use. The story differed a little from the book and the movie seemed to move a little fast but then again, what choice did they have. The movie is still two and half hours long and they had to narrow down a thousand page book! Fans need to get over it and just enjoy the film for the film, not the book. Overall, The Goblet of Fire did not disappoint my extremely high expectations in any way whatsoever and the film set forth what should be an excellent next couple of movies.I highly recommend this film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Major Disappointment,"I wanted so badly to enjoy this. However, I cannot let my Potter fandom cloud the fact that this movie is NOWHERE near a ""10.""Now, I will admit to having held high standards walking into this movie. But that standard was set by the quality of the previous films in the Potter series. The previous three installments have been mind-blowers, so I unwittingly assumed that this would top them all.I was wrong.While visually stunning and well-directed, it simply tried to do too much, and wound up doing very little.I imagine a screenwriter's mad scramble to appease book-loving audiences, while not losing the casual viewer.The result was, quite frankly, an unfocused hodge-podge of book fragments.A short list of what didn't work for me and why:1. The budding romance between Cho Chang and Harry was forced, at best, into awkward moments of little chemistry. This subplot needed much more development in order to be effective, because as it is, they speak to each other maybe three or four times within a three and a half hour movie. Nowhere near the screen time to warrant the attention it attempts. So essentially, this whole subplot felt like filler.2. At no point had I felt that anyone was going to ""lose themselves,"" in the final challenge. Krum, the only example that comes close to this mock threat, was under Voldemort's influence (an ambiguous leap at best, by the way). Despite Cedric's courtship of Cho Chang, I had no reason whatsoever to suspect that Harry would ""lose himself,"" as Dumbledore forewarned.3. I did not feel that there was really any threat, even from Voldemort. He seemed to be an afterthought, and the big confrontation at the end felt like a teaser to yet another sequel.Another example of missed opportunity is in the supposed threat of the tournament. Simply saying that ""wizards have died,"" in the tournament previously does not do justice to what even a single visual example can. And let's not forget that the tournament didn't even kill Cedric; Voldemort did.4. I felt that the entire opening, up until the point where the tri-wizard tournament began, was arbitrary and only served to set a mood. I feel that the set design (a major strength, in my view) and basic story did the job well enough. Not that it was badly done, but that the opening half-hour could have been used for better development of other subplots. By the end of the movie, and apparently Harry's fourth year, the audience is left scratching their heads, as no tangible chronology is provided for ANY PART of this movie.I could continue, but my point is clear: an eight-hundred page book adapted into one three and a half hour film either cuts prominent sections of the original text out of the finished product, or tries to make a mad scramble to stay relatively close to the original work.The result here, unfortunately, is a film with a lot of potential, and little else. The script is simply too unfocused, and the result is the ambiguous and underdeveloped mess this film slowly became.Maybe Mike Newell would have been wise to listen to the studio's wishes. It could well have saved this film from what it became.All in all, it was a feast for the eyes, but still only a well-directed train wreck.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
What do you want to do when exciting film is waiting for you!,"Can our world turn into Hogwarts? Oh, no, it can never, but I bet that Goblet of Fire will cease your imagination, your mind and shift you away from reality and makes you feel that you actually live in Hogwarts with Harry, Ron and Hermione.

I have read the book several times, but still wants to see the happenings on the big screen How Lord Voldemort stops Harry from getting the Triwizard cup How someone gets killed (can't reveal the name - guidelines) .what happens to Hermione, how will she find her date in the Competition, what about Harry's infatuation, will he find someone good?

"Goblet of Fire, is Entertaining, Well paced and very intense!","Probably one of the most interesting Harry Potter films, and I'll speak why in due time. I would however like to say, I have NOT read the book. So it doesn't inflict or damage my overall thoughts on the actual film, luckily for me in that respect. But honestly, despite that criticism I think the movie is a whole lot of fun, and energetic from the get go.We see at the start of the film that a snake is going around and looking for the Lord master, who we do not speak his name. A man is also boiling a kettle, in the house where Voldemort lies, and Barty Crouch Jr a new character added to the mix.Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) puts on a sublime performance, he's got the talent now and suits the role perfectly here. His best stuff and scenes are in this film. Ron and Harry have more things to say and do, and conflicts this time around that need to be quickly ratified. And it makes the film more interesting, and the script is better this time around, and number 4 is really when Daniel clicks as are main protagonist.The Dance is so Iconic with how Hermione walks down to meet the love of her life, it's also a great way to showcase what are characters can do rather then doing spells. And it's a nice change of pace and adds more depth in this world. The Music, the drama. Everything is displayed so well here, even Hermione who has a go at Ron and Harry, and the strop she has. Letting us know as the audience she is now an angst teenager. And it's great to see some more character growth.The trywizard tournament is so full of energy, exciting and thrilling scenes that keeps you on the edge of your seat demanding more. It's the greatest set of entertaining scenes. The water scene where they have to go and rescue someone, it's intense and it's very fast paced and doesn't stop moving. It just delivers short and precised action and gets streight to the point, and I love that. Also the props for this film are top-tier and will stand the test of time, so detailed and lukewarm you just feel a real sense of mystery and wonder about it. And again, it's a nice change of pace.Also the dragon scene. Full of action and energy, it's filled with intense scenes and therefore it's thrilling to watch Harry try and survive against a dragon. We get to see alot of Hogwarts as he flies away on his broom, it's so layered and so interesting just watching it play out.The Maze is then where we see Voldermort at the end, and the scene is dark and creepy giving of an eerie vibe. It's so well shot too. And the duel between Harry and Voldemort is just the best and it's so much more entertaining as they are actually using spells to defeat one another. And the dark Lord has returned to strike fear into anyone's eye.We also get to see a real quidditch match, which is peak Cinema. It felt so real and grounded and it was a nice direction to take it. I love the scenes where the teams are scoring, because the crowd cheer so loudly, and that's what makes it feel like a live match being demonstrated to us as the audience. Which, also they are the audience too.Would I recommend this film?Eh?, yeah definitely, 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Fabulous!!!,"First of all I have to admit that i am a huge fan of the books and the film, and was really looking forward to see the 4th instalment.I have to say that the acting of Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and especially Rupert Grint and the guy that plays Neville Longbottom (Temporary memory loss, sorry)was excellent, there was no cringe worthy moments, which i found in the previous films. They have all grown up a lot.The whole film seemed like it had been plucked from my imagination, whilst reading the book, especially the second task, third task, the graveyard and the pen sieve.I was in hysterics through the first 3/4 of the film and tearful in the last 1/4 film.I think a non-harry potter fan (bizarre as it may sound that there are people that don't like harry potter)would even enjoy the film.Cnat wait to see the film again.

The Best of the series.,I may be a little too old to be Potterphile but i ain't ashamed of it.Yeah! i caught the show at a media screening and this is a too great movie to be viewed free.HAHA!lucky me!This is the best of the lot as whoever's read the books will agree with me that this is the most action packed of the 6 books.When i read it i knew it will make a heart stopper.The length of the book concerned me as i realized that there will be some cuts and chops or else the result will be a 'Lord of the Rings' styled mutimovie series adding up to some 5 hours.I had some doubts about the selection of Mike Newell as the director but he did a Peter Jackson with this movie.This may be the highest grosser this year eclipsing 'Star Wars Ep-III'. He's done a magnificent job shooting and editing this movie.Its smooth sailing.There was once a talk of replacing the cast with older actors but the decision to keep them looks great as as the 'Kids' are growing up with their characters.The casting is great as always but the only glitch appears to be the casting of 'Fleur Delacour'. Clemence is good but sometimes Emma'Hermione'Watson(who's supposed to be this ugly duckling in the books) looks better than her. Or maybe i am biased towards Emma.Anyway for you folks who will have to wait till its commercial release i am sure you will feel your time and money well spent.Go and watch it.Folks!,9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
An emperor without clothes,"The new Harry Potter movie is entertaining and has the basic elements of it's predecessors that entertain, but it bogs down in the middle and ultimately sags under it's own weight. While the plot is interesting, the movie suffers from the same affliction that ""Lord of the Rings"" developed, namely an over-reliance on prolonged action sequences and special effects. It is worth the price of admission to see it in the theater for the special effects, but it is an emperor without clothes and does not live up to the pre-release hype.

"""Dark and difficult times lie ahead, Harry. Soon we must all face the choice between what is right... and what is easy. "" - Dumbledore","For me, one of the most exciting series of movies is the 'Harry Potter' movies. Being a moderate fan of the books (I read 1-4), I found it hard to read them all. I wanted to, but they are just so long and time consuming. To be perfectly honest, I really don't have the time to read them, so I just go see the films. No matter how long they are they never drag and they always hold my attention which is very, very rare for any film no matter how long. Going to to the latest installment 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire', I had extremely high expectations that got met for the most part. I was expecting 'Goblet of Fire' to be so much better than 'Prisoner of Azkaban' since they keep getting better, but actually I found 'Goblet' and 'Prisoner' to be equal in quality. You could say I was a tad disappointed, but even still, 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' is an amazing motion picture that never, ever had me bored during it's entire 2 hour and 40 minute runtime. I was absolutely enthralled from start to finish.'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' is the fourth chapter in the series. Unlike 1-3, it doesn't open with Harry at home with his evil aunt and uncle and their retched little chunky brat son, but instead opens with a nightmare. The nightmare is Peter Pettigrew (Timothy Spall - The Last Samurai) the villain of the last film, nursing a weak Voldermort back to health with a strange guy. This sets the stage for the plot of this movie. It's about Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Hermoine (Emma Watson), and Ron (Rupert Grint) returning to Hogwarts after seeing a Quidditch match. At Hogwarts they are holding a big young Wizards tournament where Hogwarts and two different Wizard schools from across the world are competing. In order to compete you have to be at least 17 years old, and guess what, by some odd-ball chance guess who gets picked to compete? Harry Potter, of course! Now Harry must buckle-up for a dangerous tournament and save the Hogwarts campus once again from a healing Voldermort's wrath.The plot of every Harry Potter is silly and unbelievable, but that's the point. 'Harry Potter' is a fantasy and feel-good movie, it's not a realistic or ground-breaking film series to any stretch. It's warm, silly, action-packed, dare I say 'family' fun that almost anyone could enjoy. British director Mike Newell (Donnie Brasco) does a great job directing this, in my opinion he's the best director they've had yet. The screenplay is entertaining but leaves out a lot of interesting aspects the book had. I still can't believe they cut out the opening Quidditch match though, but in order to make it fit in a time frame of less than 3 hours they had to make some serious cuts to the 734 page book. Radcliffe is solid as usual, while Grint and Watson are good, but don't have nearly as big of parts as the did in the three previous films. Actually, no one (except Dumbledore and Snape) have as big of parts as in the other films. Maggie Smith as McGonnagall has what some might say a glorified extra and Robbie Coltrane as the giant Hagrid only has about two major scenes. There are three additions to the cast this time around - Brendan Gleeson, Miranda Richardson and the creepy Ralph Fiennes. Miranda Richardson does a good job playing a nosy wizard journalist while Gleeson owns every minute he is own screen in a show-stopping performance as Mad-Eye Moody. Ralph Fiennes is a perfect candidate for the evil Lord Voldermort even if he is only in the film for about ten minutes. You may remember Fiennes as the vile and malicious commanding Nazi in 'Schindler's List'. The fourth Harry Potter installment also has the best action sequences, special effects, cinematography and make-up so far that is sure to pick up some Academy Award nominations come March.'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' is an excellent film, and overall it never ceases to entertain you. I can almost guarantee you when you look at your watch after getting out of theater, you will be shocked at how much time has gone by. 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' succeeds with flying colors in enrapturing you in it's content from start to finish. What more can you ask for in an action movie?

not satisfying,"As someone who has never read the books, but enjoyed the other filmed Potters, I was disappointed with #4.The biggest problem was the pacing: I found myself loosing interest pretty soon after it started. Not that I ever really got bored. Just that I had a hard time caring. Something about the acting (more likely the directing) didn't ""sell"" me. Plus, the story arc was weird and hard to make sense out of. No matter how good a book is or how faithful you want the movie to be to it, a film must stand on its own terms and be true to its own world. Harry Potter 4 fails on both counts.Also, some of the music was unbearably cheesy (""prom scene"" and closing credits).",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
As bad as Emma Watson's acting,"Best book, worst movie. Just awful. Michael Gambon decided he was too good to read the books and it shows, in his pitifully inaccurate performance of Dumbledore as an angry and arrogant man. Emma Watson over acted in every scene (her eyebrows work overtime to the point of comedy). Dobby is one of the most beloved characters and he was cut completely. Not to mention the rest of the nonsense inaccuracies.Good points are Moody - the actor who played him was spot on. And the usual excellent performances from Snape, McGonagall and Hagrid. I re watch this movie only out of nostalgia when I re read the books, and to support JK Rowling, who is an absolute legend.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Terrific Blend of Story, Effects and Showcase of Young and Old Actors","""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" is a wonderful treat for the fans of the books and the earlier movies in the series, as it wastes no time explaining anything to newbies.After the prologue, our first look at Harry reveals he's now a gangly young teen for even more visceral reaction than seeing Anakin Skywalker at the same gawky age in ""Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones"" because here it's been the same actor who we have seen age on screen; I immediately vote for continuing with the trio of Daniel Radcliffe as Harry, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger and Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley for the rest of the adaptations, as they are literally growing into their roles. (Though with them fitting in other movies in between these I do feel pangs of maternal guilt at their lost childhoods.) Twins James and Oliver Phelps as the Weasley twins have also developed more hunkily than the characters' in my imagination from the pages in the book.All of their rangy messiness is particularly apt as director Mike Newell better captures the ambiance of normal English boarding school life than the other films, from the dorms to the common and dining rooms and professors' offices to the horrors of the first formal dance and the first awkward stirrings of attraction to the opposite sex, which adds a lot of leavening humor to the adventure. The attention to detail in the production design is marvelous; I counted three people in the credits responsible for draperies. Hogwarts is notably more multicultural this year, and not just because of the international Tri-Wizard Tournament; it challenges American stereotypes to hear ""Cho Chang"" speak with a Scottish brogue like the inimitable Maggie Smith does here too.Eliminating the dreary annual summer stay at the relatives helps to literally whoosh us fast into magical environs as it quickly moves to the creatively envisioned quidditch world tournament that is necessarily rushed but is still a lot of fun before capturing the spookiness of the stealth attack by the followers of You Know Who -- and viewers have to already know who he and Sirius Black are, the family relationships, and what are Death Eaters, poly juice, sorting, etc. One small weakness is that quidditch fans dress in the same outlandish nonsense as muggle sports fans, but the visiting tournament teams' costumes and choreography are even more fun than the opening ceremonies of the Olympics.Until that time in the future when a very long, faithfully done mini-series adaptation can be made, it's forgivable that in the rush to fit in as many climaxes as possible of the long, complicated story it is a bit hard to have story insights to make you care for the new characters, though they are played by charming youngsters, particularly handsome Robert Pattinson as Hogwarts' official tournament competitor, and the girl classmates who amusingly prove that female wizards mature earlier too. I appreciate the effort gone to cast a young Bulgarian as competitor ""Vicktor Krum"" with the right physique, but it's a good thing he's seen quite briefly.I lost count at ten at the number of special effects companies in the U.S. and Britain involved in the production, but it did seem as if CGI was put to effective background service to quaintly old-fashioned models, animatronics and mattes that fit the Hogwarts environment. I was particularly impressed that no matter how cool an effect was, it wasn't repeated for preening purposes and always served the story, as did the music. The underwater scenes were wonderful. The landscape of Hogwarts, from the castle to the lake to the forest, have a real sense of geography. Those who did stay through all the credits were rewarded by being assured that no dragons were harmed in the production, as the dragon challenge was thrilling even as it fondly recalled Ray Harryhausen's mythic battles for a new generation. I was not as impressed with Liam Neeson's make-up for Vol de Mort, as he seemed too much like Marty Feldman's Igor in ""Young Frankenstein.""But even with all these impressive effects, the films remain a showcase of the richness of British acting talent, of artists who go from TV to theater to serious indie cinema to small roles in this populist extravaganza. Brendan Gleeson seems more avuncular as this term's Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher than was in the book, while having fun with his body props. I thought Miranda Richardson was not even as obnoxious or tartily made up on screen as Rita Skeeter is in the books. But I hope they all are signed up for the long term, as this fourth film clearly ends like a serial and I look forward to the next film as much as I look ahead to the next book.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Better than Harry Potter 3,"I have watched this yesterday, finally after a long waiting :) I thought it will be a very long movie, but in fact it is only 2.5 hours. This movie is very good :) the animation is smooth and very alive, I like the part when Harry had a fight with the dragon :) really good. But Dumbledore is a bit too young and too funky I think, it made him seem not as wise as usual. Overall, this is a good movie, funny and make you laugh from the beginning till the end. Watch the part when Ron is getting shock after he asked Fleur to go with him to the bow :D:D:D very funny. Too bad the time is too short, only 2.5 hours, so many details are not exist in the movie. you got to watch this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
goodness,"I can't believe your comment. First you say that you understand that they can't fit everything into the film and then go on to bash it. Exactly how do you think they could've improved it? They had 2 1/2 half hours to film a 700+ page book. There's not much they could do, if anything blame Warner Bros. They're the ones who didn't allow the film to be any longer. Besides, what they did was fine. You just have problems. True the movie was fast but they really had no choice. So if you have such a problem then don't bother people with your bad attitude. Do you not realize that the number of people who like the movie far outnumber the people who don't like it? Also, JKR has a say in the movie too and so if she's fine with it, then I think everyone who respects JKR should accept it the way it is and stop complaining.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Very good, but better editing could have made it much better.","A superb 4th movie here. Darker and more scary than the previous three, but it could have been so much better.There are several places throughout the film where comments are made that seem to make no sense, obviously because a preceeding scene has been cut. Hopefully this will be sorted in the DVD release.So much of the book has been cut though, and several things that occur in future books have been overlooked (How are they going to blackmail Reeter Skeeter in the next film, when in this one her secret isn't revealed?) In future, and especially The Order of the Phoenix, they MUST do it in 2 films to preserve the great story, rather than cutting half the book as they do in this one.Overall though, another good film, worth the wait.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Films are NOT books - about time this was realised,"I think SOME people who write reviews should remember that books rarely translate to movies well or in the way you expect. So unless you go to an adaptation with and open mind and with the view of seeing it for being a FILM and not ""oh that wasn't in the book"" or ""god they missed that bit out"" - then don't go.Great film. Musch better than the other 3. The actors are really beginning to come out of themselves and thrive on the camera. Still some ""slightly"" woody acting bits but on the whole thumbs up. A really good night out for any harry potter fan or anyone who is interested in fantasy. Though be warned there are a couple of little bits that may scare younger children so just be carefull with the youngens :) thanks for taking time out to read this.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
howler,"I beg you to replace Michael Gambon or to modify his character because his acting is ridiculous and it humiliates the figure of Dumbledore at the same time. He has NOTHING in common with the character of the book and I don't understand why it was needed to change his features. It does not influence the length of the movie and I don't think it would require more money to be faithful and consequent to the original character. Why was it necessary then? Please, explain, why did they turn Dumbledore into a clown!!! As opposed to the first actor I mentioned in my opinion Ralph .. was the perfect choice to represent the unique character of The Dark Lord. His acting abilities made him absolutely appropriate to provide the audience with the characteristic features of the original figure of the book. In the question of authenticity I would highlight the performance of Alan Rickman ,Emma Watson, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane and Ralph Fiennes. I believe they personalized the characters of the book in the most ""loyal"" manner",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Excellent.,I caught an advanced screening of this movie and I absolutely loved it. It really takes a British to film it accurately. It's a shame Newell only got 1 million to direct...he deserves double what Chris Columbus got (10 mil for the 1st film).The trio is better than ever..and the effects are just awesome. Everybody will truly LOVE the graveyard scene. I actually had it pictured exactly this way when i was reading the book. What the first 3 movie lacks is the chemistry and warmth of the characters between each other. i'm also really glad that this movie is released in November. Harry potter for me will always be a winter/fall film. It doesn't fit a summer agenda. Too bad OOTP will be released June 07. November PPl...November...is the perfect date.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Good action---poor character and plot development,"Check out the Paly Voice at http://voice.paly.net for two different reviews of this movie.I thought the movie was well-done in terms of graphics and action-sequences, but it was lacking in character and plot development.I liked the first three movies better because there were more scenes depicting character interaction.The film was good overall, however, could have a greater focus on characters.I recommend that you see it and decide for yourself. There are many parts that I enjoyed profusely, such as the ball sequences, and especially the second task in the TriWizard Tournament.Happy viewing!",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Worst Adaptation of All,"I love the cast and the general magic of the film of course! But it is such a confusing and blah adaptation of the book. The changes made make no sense whatsoever, and take away from one of the best twists in the entire series. Like way to spell it out for people, there's no mystery at all. The impact of several important moments is made so blah. I just don't like it as a book reader. I guess if you don't read the books then it's great (which is why people seem to like this one) but the drastic changes are frustrating. The removal of Dobby makes the last movie less impactful, and that goes for the whole series (minus 2 and DH1 appearances). But the main plot changes and the in-your-faceness of it all is really the worst part.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

"Not as good as earlier episodes, go see Firefly instead","Hmm, normally I do not write reviews of movies but once in a while I feel that I need to comment on movies.Luckily I am at this moment in a country where they started showing movie 4 today!If you are a fantasy freak you know the feeling of a book series. They start great and get you hooked, then as time progresses and the books continue the story gets dragged out in order for the writer or publisher to get more money. This is the case with Harry Potter both the books and the movies.My opinion is that the first movie was quite nice, the second a bit less, the third I won't talk about it and the fourth, well you have to see for yourself but I think that it is a bit less than its predecessors. Unfortunately you keep on reading since you have to know how the story ends, do you?This is part first of all because of directing and acting (we've done this before) and part of the story. Of course not everything in the book can be filmed that is not possible from a cost/revenue perspective. So corners need to be cut. Second the books themselves, as admitted by the writer herself some material got moved around the books which makes them less interesting as they progress (especially the last book which looks less like a story than something to tie loose ends with). This has its influence on the film.I give it a 6 out of ten. The movie is OK if you have nothing better to do otherwise there are better movies out there, try firefly for example. I suspect that with the imminent release of King Kong the studio decided to make some quick bucks since I believe that when Mr. Jackson's latest effort comes out, Harry Potter and Co. do not stand a chance.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The best of the four Potter flicks!,"Finally we have got a Potter flick that somewhat meets our high expectations! Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire captures the drama of the book and makes for gripping, flashy cinema. While some goof-ups are apparent in the film and some important sections of the story have been omitted, the film , on the whole is quite good to see. With the III instalment of the story been a pain to watch, the IV movie restores back the good quality that must be associated to every Potter flick. As this is the flick where The Dark Lord returns, it is certainly a very eagerly awaited one. I must say that the Dark Lord's resurrection is splendidly shown and does give due respect to JKR's visualization.In the acting arena, the three lead stars, Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), Rupert Grint (Ron) and Emma Watson (Hermione Granger) give damn good performances and have certainly matured as actors. Emma Watson, in particular, impressed me for her admirable acting and breathtaking beauty. In fact, Watson has such a powerful impact on the film that the other two female characters - Cho Chang (Yuck!) and Fleur Delacour(OK, but certainly not Ooh!) are eclipsed. Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort is great and it will be interesting to see how his character develops in the next 3 movies. Finally, a plea to the film-makers, please please please find a suitable actor to play Albus Dumbledore - Michael Gambon is a pain to watch",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
this movie wasn't even that good,"this cost 308 million? why? the last one was way better, this one looked cheap. for the average movie goer who isn't obsessed with harry potter, its not that great. you may get lost. and what's up with the Russian love interest of Hermione. ill say this, there were some pretty funny parts. which was good, but honestly, the last movie was better, style wise, etc. some of the special effects in this one weren't even that great. they should have made this into two movies. no debating. but i guess they don't need to appeal to the average movie-goer. there's enough potter book fans that it doesn't matter. also, i swear to god, one of the death spells Voldemort casts on Harry is Abra-cadabra. the competition was cool. that's about it.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

I am not here to discuss the good and bad of Hollywood)...Also Michael Gambon has re-made Dumbledore his own. I am not a fan of his version but I understand the he could not do it the same way as Richard Harris (who played the part exactly as I pictured it when I read the books)...All in all - definitely see the movie...better than POA if not quite up to bar with the first two.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Harry Potter films are just getting stronger and stronger,"With all our favourite characters well established and the actors all truly into their respective roles, Harry's fourth outing, sees some new introductions (Mad-eye Moody is brilliant) and some really interesting story revelations that unfold within the main theme, which is very imaginative and strongly written.The tri-wizard tournament has come to Howarts and one 17 year old entry from each of the three schools is chosen to represent their school, when Harry's name is picked at the age of 14, everyone is left bemused as to how and why this could have happened; but he has to abide by the magical contract and compete along side the other three champions nonetheless.The four champions have to fight dragons, solve the mystery of the black lake and survive the terror of the final task within a huge maze.This outing is definitely the darkest so far, and the truth behind Harry's shock entry into the tournament is nothing short of astounding, the closing scenes are deeply atmospheric and very graphic for a movie that is rated '12 - UK/PG13 - US'9/10 I'm simply dying to see the next instalment, the magic just keeps getting stronger.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

How much can we cram into two and half hours?!!!,"I found this movie to be a big disappointment. It was very abrupt and staccato in the storyline which made it very hard to follow.

It was WAY too much crammed into 2 hours.This movie should have been two movies. Perhaps they should have released them a month apart or something.

I know fans were divided on ""POA"" and I was definitely in the ""hated it"" camp with the reason being how many important elements were left out, and not just nitpicking little items but key ingredients.Enough reviewers here have told you about the plot and my, my how the kids have grown but what I would like to add is that this latest Harry Potter film really captures the humor of the books.

But I don't want to write an essay, but only tell that I was very very sad to see Fiennes' acting as Voldemort... Voldemort was not what I had expected... he looked like Rambo gone mental... Too muscular, too human and not at all frightening... Jason Isac were more scary than Ralph Fiennes... Mike Newell should have done that better...",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Parents STRONGLY Cautioned,"First and foremost, this is NOT a kids' movie. This is a story about a boy who is the target of a very ruthless, very violent, and very frightening killer. As Harry grows older, his problems grow more mature-themed, and Goblet of Fire is the major pivoting point. To parents who think they can just send their kids off to the theater for a cute little Harry Potter movie, be warned that you'll probably want to see it yourselves first before making that decision. This movie is scary. There are scenes of torture, mutilation, death, implied gore, and a bit of sexual innuendo (""What's got your wand in a knot?""). This movies is rated PG-13, and is about one slip of a mermaid's hair from being rated R. When I saw it in the theater, the outside doors opened at least three separate times so a parent could remove their child from the movie's influence.And you should be able to tell by the opening scene. The first shot is of a pile of skulls in the dark with a rather large snake slithering through them. The dark palette is carried through the entire movie, with the most color existing in a magical fireworks show near the beginning and in Ron's new robes. Except for these ten to fifteen minutes of footage, the entire movie is extremely drab, and for the most part dark.However, for those of you that have read and enjoy the books, you will not be disappointed. Many sections of the book were cut, as had to be done for the movie to work. But Newell knew what he was doing; the important parts (that is, the parts I remember from when I read the book years ago) are still there. Also included are many direct quotes from the book, a rarity in novel-to-screen conversions. No important events were cut, added, or altered, and virtually every character is played well.Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint are definitely figuring out how to act, and give a performance that is a huge improvement from the first movie. With all due respect to Richard Harris, Michael Gambon should have been the first choice for Dumbledore. Brendan Gleeson plays an extremely convincing Moody, and Miranda Richardson perfectly portrays Rita Skeeter's self-obsessed annoyingness.Overall this movie is excellent. I give it a 10 out of 10 because there is absolutely nothing feasible that I can think of to improve it. Just beware that this is NOT a movie that you'd want to use as a babysitter. Remember that it's PG-13 for a reason.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Terrific, more mature, although a little rushed","The fourth installment of the 'Harry Potter'-series is probably the most entertaining of them all for it's wall to wall action and comedy. For some this can also be a problem. The story is a little rushed. It is like a road trip where you only do the attractions on the way, but never travel from one attraction to another. Of course that is an entertaining way to do a road trip but it can be good to catch your breath from time to time, enjoy the world around you.This counts especially for a world as beautifully visualized as Harry Potter's. Art direction, set decoration, costumes and visual effects are once again terrific, creating a feast for the eye. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron Weasly (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) inhabit this world as if they have lived there their entire lives; not only the movie but also the actors are more mature. The story has grown darker with every new film and here it deserves its PG-13 rating. Death and destruction are pretty present in 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'.I could go into the story, which deals with a deadly tri-wizard tournament that Harry enters even though he is too young and the first real appearance of Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes), but it does not really matter. The story is a nice framework to show us everything in the movie, also including brilliant performances by Brendan Gleeson as Alastor Moody, Miranda Richardson as journalist Rita Skeeter and returning actors like Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane and a great Alan Rickman as Severus Snape.'The Sorcerer's Stone' and 'The Chamber of Secrets' gave the series its magical touch, it was a little lost in 'The Prisoner of Azkaban', for me still the best, but director Alfonso Cuarón made up for that with especially the cinematography. Now we have 'The Goblet of Fire' where magical touches have changed mostly into darkness, maturity and some great action and comedy scenes. It seems to me this is the right approach to the series.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Reasons I rated this movie only a 5,"First of all, I have to say that I really enjoyed the movie, and I would have rated it a 10 if not for the following reasons. My favorite characters, other than the main ones (Harry, Ron and Hermione), were completely left out of the movie. The scene with the Dursley's (in the book, when the Weasley's come for Harry) was so great, it should have been in the movie. I was really disappointed about not seeing Dobby or Sirius. Okay, maybe they aren't absolutely necessary, but they are both pretty important in Harry's life. I would rather sit through a longer movie that includes all the essential parts of the story than a shorter version with outstanding special effects.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"The best ""Harry Potter"" yet. To the fans, don't judge the film to harshly.","""Goblet of Fire"" made some people eat their words. ""Harry Potter"" is not just a kiddie franchise. ""Goblet"" is mature, adult (but not in porn-like adult), and scary. I don't think PG-13 (or 12A for Brits)films are meant for the kiddies.My first reaction to hearing the news of the running time was basically, ""It's impossible. They can't fit it all."" And they couldn't fit it all, but one has to think about what they're saying. In any film adaptation of any book, especially Harry Potter, one has to separate the books from the films. Harry Potter has its books, and it has its films, so the important thing to remember when seeing this is deciding if the atmosphere and the spirit, not the facts, of the books are there. And with ""Goblet"", they atmosphere and spirit were in every shot, with every note of the score. Overall, ""Goblet"" was the best ""Harry"" film yet.Since the point of my review is to persuade people into seeing it and liking it, I will only talk about the good points, which outweighed the bad. Patrick Doyle is now the new composer filling in the shoes of beloved-by-Harry-Potter-fans composer, John Williams. While Doyle hasn't composed any memorable themes for ""Harry Potter"" yet, his music is the key to creating the atmosphere of every scene. The opening tune is really captivating, and features a minor-key version of ""Hedwig's Theme"" and the music in the scene in which Cedric dies made the scene a lot more emotional than what it could have been without the music. But I still give props to the actors in that scene as well.Mike Newell has brought more out of the characters than J.K. Rowling has transferred to the pages of the book (but J.K.R. still kicks literary a$$)I thought that in this new film, Snape and McGonagall were very funny, Snape in a darker way. I also loved the scene in which they were speaking with Dumbledore after Harry was chosen for the Tournament. Neville was quite funny, and also, Mike Newell made his part larger to foreshadow a slightly closer relationship with Harry in the fifth film. When Neville moaned, ""Oh, my God! I've killed Harry Potter!"" the theater was in uproar. Props to Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and Matthew Lewis! Plus, who could forget the new, more human Voldemort portrayed by Ralph Fiennes? His makeup was really weird/creepy/awesome, and his personality was so much like the book. He talked quite smoothly and calmly, but in a malicious fashion. The only time he expressed anger was when Harry escaped, which was perfect! Props to Ralph Fiennes and to Mike Newell for making him that way!And last, but most definitely not the least, actually the most important, sort of, Dan, Rupert, and Emma, the golden trio! Many can remember in the first film when Harry's main reaction was something along the lines of ""Oh my God, what the crap!?!??"" and a lot of wide eyes and open-hanging jaws. As he slowly gained a personality, ahem, and finally had one in the fourth film, Dan made sure to give it his all, or at least it's evident. He has brought a lot to Harry's character in the fourth film, such as comedy and emotion. Referring to the Cedric death scene, or the part when Harry takes his body back to Hogwarts, I recall that I said that the music made it more sad. I sort of have to eat my words, because despite the music, Dan could have made it sad by itself. It's hard to cry on cue, people, and being one who cracks smiles during crying scenes and stuff like that, I did not crack even a small smirk. Dan is one of the most talented under-18 actors all over the world. Also, Emma brought much more to Hermione than snobbishness and smarts. She actually had herself a boyfriend, sort of. Once again, Emma stunned us. Lastly, Rupert was really funny, as always, but made so many people gape at his anger, especially his ""Piss off"" comment. Excellent job, Dan, Rupert, and Emma! So what are you sitting and reading this for? Go see ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" right now!!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A magical turning point,"""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"" directed by Mike Newell, marks a significant turning point in the Harry Potter film series. The fourth installment sees Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) entering his fourth year at Hogwarts, where he is unexpectedly chosen to compete in the dangerous Triwizard Tournament. This event brings new challenges, alliances, and adversaries, pushing Harry beyond the familiar confines of Hogwarts.The film excels in its darker and more mature tone, reflecting the series' shift from a whimsical adventure to a more complex and perilous journey. The introduction of the Triwizard Tournament adds an exciting and suspenseful element, with visually stunning sequences and thrilling tasks that keep viewers on the edge of their seats.Performances by the cast remain strong, with Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson continuing to develop their characters with depth and nuance. The addition of new characters, such as the enigmatic Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson) and the charming Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson), enriches the story and adds fresh dynamics to the ensemble.While the film condenses J. K. Rowling's detailed novel, occasionally sacrificing depth for pacing, it successfully captures the essence of the book's pivotal moments. ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" balances magical wonder with growing tension, making it a compelling and crucial chapter in the beloved series.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A thriller Harry Potter movie,"It's not as good as the other Harry Potter movies but had an amazing story. In this movie, the Triwizard tournament is held at Hogwarts, and the three schools assemble there.Now any one student from each school is to participate in this tournament, but from Hogwarts two children have been. They are Harry Potter and Cedric Diggory. Now, this tournament states that all the children above the age of 17 can only participate and Harry is below the age. The tournament also states that only one child from each school would participate.People now that they know that Harry is a contestant, call him a liar. Ron, Harry's best friend also leaves Harry. People started wearing badges that stated ""Cedric rules. Harry stinks"". I liked that part a lot!The adventures were really amazing. they were - fighting a dragon, saving a precious friend and the maze.In the maze, Harry Potter and Cedric Diggory together meet Lord Voldemort, where he kills Cedric. The trophy turned out to be a port-key.Now to know what would Harry do, watch the movie!:)",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Beginning Half the Book is 5 Minutes of the Movie,"I must say that I was truly disappointed by this rendition of a Harry Potter book. I've read about half of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire before seeing the movie. When I saw the movie, I disappointed to see that I had read about 5 minutes of the book! They left out many characters and details, along with the absence of the opening scene with Dudley, Uncle Vernon, and Aunt Petunia. There is also a chapter about Dobby and other house-elves, which was also absent in the movie. With Michael Gambon playing as Dumbledore, Dumbledore seems more dark and ""mean"" if you will with his style of speaking. The music orchestration was also dry since John Williams wasn't the composer for it. The main Harry Potter theme is no where to be heard in this film. The only music by JW to be heard in the movie is Hedwig's Theme, who is seen in the movie for a good minute.The lighting for this movie was way to dark in the movie theater. It was hard at times to figure out what was going on because of this. Luckily, with my television, I could adjust the brightness of the screen. I believe that Mike Newell could have done better.Besides these flaws, the movie was a great addition to the Harry Potter movie collection. It was more fun and portrayed the book very well. Love played a major role in the book as well as the movie. Many of the scenes were well played out. The characters seem to grow up as well in this film. If you are a Harry Potter fan, this is a movie to see.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
What is the Magic of Harry Potter?,"J.K. Knowlings, author of the Potter series has created an unlikely hero. Harry Potter, an awkward boy with glasses who possesses a powerful spirit. He possesses courage, stamina, logic, sensibility, patience, love and wisdom. He also possesses hate caused by Lord Voldemort, the person responsible for the death of Harry's Parents when he was a baby. Our hero Harry Potter possesses one more trait: He is a Wizard.Harry Potter and The Goblet Of Fire is the Fourth installment of the Knowling series. The young wizards, Harry, Hermoine, and Ron are back for their fourth year at Hogwarts, the Wizard School located somewhere between time and dimension. The school is an incredible Castle on a mountainside surrounded by snowy peaks and green forests and a tranquil lake. Within Hogwarts interior we meet the familiar cast of Wizards, Witches, Creatures, and returning students. It is a colorful and entertaining cast.Harry finds himself selected by the Goblet Of Fire as an underage competitor in a dangerous multi-wizardry school competition known as the Tri Wizard Tournament in which student representatives from three different sorcery schools compete in a series of increasingly challenging contests. The tournament is to be held at Hogwarts. Harry must fend off accusations of tampering with the Goblet of Fire. The School's Top Wizards are concerned for Harry and suspicious of him as well. New characters emerge throughout the film including Alastor 'MadEye' Moody who is the new Professor of the Dark Arts.Harry, Ron, and Hermione are now 14 and experiencing the hormonal changes taking place. Puberty brings with it many dark forces that all teenagers must battle as they try to make it through school and life. The Goblet Of Fire has an allegorical tone of using the dark forces of Puberty. The Dragons that come at you during those confusing years are powerful but must be faced just as Harry battles his fire breather in one of the tournaments challenges.British Director Mike Newell (Four Weddings and A Funeral, Enchanted April, Donnie Brasco) takes on the Potter series and rises above the call of duty. He creates some beautiful visuals, including a silhouetted shot of the young wizards running along a hillside in the beginning of the film. It was a sure sign that the film was going to be a pleasure to watch.The entire cast flows from one to the other and seem comfortable in their roles. Daniel Radcliffe portrays Harry Potter a bit rigid and always wears the same look of wonder on his face whenever he enters anywhere new. He has been at Hogwarts for four years, one would think he would have developed a bit more culture. His character is still young and vulnerable but the Goblet of Fire has chosen Harry's name and he now must act.Albus Dumbledore, the Head Wizard of Hogwarts says to Harry: ""Dark and difficult times lie ahead, Harry. Soon we must all face the choice between what is right... and what is easy. ""The Magic Of Harry Potter is that he is you and I at our finest.Rated PG 13 for violence and mature themes.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Point of view of a non-fan (people with friends who are fans read it),"I am not a fan of Harry Potter, so you can trust me when I say this movie is quite good, very easy and fun to watch. Really, I am no Harry Potter fan, let me point my case so you'll believe me in case you're not fans and want to know if you're gonna enjoy your spent money or just throw it away to the garbage. I know the story because now it turns out that all of my friends are fans of the little mage. I saw the first movie since, as a movies fan, i wanted to know what the whole buzz was all about. I became disappointed, i was awfully bored, that was the problem, well that and all the silly situations,i believed none of them, i didn't buy them,i could forgive anything but watching a boring film, seeing a kid finding an invisible cloak is neither new nor fun for me. Of course I didn't watch the sequels, don't mention the books, but as i tell you, i seem to be the one that's wrong, now i have a girlfriend that craves everything that has to do with HP. So here i am, at the movie theater, one hour earlier to the show, i am psychologically preparing myself to watch more of the same unbelievable child tale I saw a long time ago, and they say the movie is about 2 hrs and a half long, damn. After a few silly situations the movie starts getting to a point, more important, it is fun, hey all i wanted was that from the beginning, the characters become somehow real, as real as an adventure movie can be, and the rhythm is perfect, of course, i kept laughing at some others situations, specially at the end, but hey, the overall experience was fine with me, the FX, some really nice photography, real fun characters (the twins despite being total jerks are quite fun), and lots of action, i'm telling you, this is not the ultimate adventure-action-fantasy film of all the time, but even if you don't have a son, girlfriend or friends begging u to go with them because Harry Potter is oh so fantastically marvelous and all way cool, you can seriously watch this film with no regrets, is a solid, agile action paced movie with fine FX and nice music and cinematography, truly fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Good movie, a bit different than the book","For fans of the books you will not be disappointed with gof, all of the most memorable and important moments of the book have made it into the film (although some scenes have been altered for the film which may anger purists). Unfortunately, almost everything else has been cut from the film. depending on your patience this is a good thing however as the film runs 2.5+ hours so there is already an awful lot of material here. the story is more mature than the previous (which you've probably already hear 100+ million times by now) but this is good. All of the scenes where the students struggle with the opposite sex are quite entertaining.The acting in this installment has been really stepped up from the younger members of the cast. i feel Rupert (Ron) and Emma (Hermione) out shined Dan (harry) in the acting department which is too bad as he is the protagonist but thats OK. The professors as always deliver excellent performances (i especially enjoyed Maggie smith as mcgonagel and mad eye moody (can't remember the actor)).The Special Effects in the film are breath taking. PERIOD.this movie is worth seeing for all fans and not fans of the potter series alike. The pace of the film is extremely quick (and in the beginning i found it was probably a little too quick). The acting in this outing is a cut above the previous films especially from the kids (or teens i guess i should say now). the film has a sense of humor that is more like that found in the books now, which is good in my opinion.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The flame in the goblet is slowly diminishing,"I am an avid reader of the Harry Potter books and love the movies despite certain well loved scenes being cut. J.K. Rowling said in an interview that she has always told directors to stay true to the spirit of Harry Potter if they couldn't do the movie exactly like the book.I feel that this is the biggest monstrosity to befall the spirit of Harry Potter.Why on earth does Dumbledore slam Harry up against a wall demanding to know if he put his name in the goblet? Is it not obvious that he loses his cool in almost every scene? This man is our inspiration in the Harry Potter books and Rowling consecutively portrays him as a man who does not need anger to solve situations. His humor and light heartedness has always seemed to give Harry a sense of hope. If we were to compare the past movies it would be obvious that this mishap is not one of the actor's own doing but that of the director.So many Harry Potter fans said that Richard Harris was the perfect Dumbledore and that it would be extremely hard to find someone to fill in his shoes. Well the new man on deck in Prisoner of Azkaban was hard to tell apart from Sir Richard. He was that true to the spirit of Dumbledore. His mannerisms, his spherical character were more than enough to ease audiences fears of what could have been a drastically bad choice.How could someone so perfect in the third, epic film change so suddenly in just a years time at Hogwarts? It is clear that the director of the film wanted every character to match the dark and ominous mood of Voldermort's return and in the headmaster he made a gargantuan mistake. Dumbledore is the only person He Who Must Not Be Named fears and there has always been great contrast in the two that make a child believe the angry and violent can be overpowered by the humble and wise.In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Voldermort and Dumbledore are one and the same and those who do not read the books can be extremely excited that the movies are turning into another Matrix film.There is no spirit of Harry Potter left when you take away the glimmer of hope that a truly good book can hold the same feeling in a movie.It's a lovely film for younger audiences who, of course, are only drawn to a film for more than ten minutes if something is fire breathing or adventurous, but I have to wonder whether or not the true spirit of Harry Potter that made the underdog children on the playground who were picked on feel they had something of worth has been lost in the glitz and glam of the Hollywood world we live in.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"I'm Going to watch this again, and again, and again and again and again and again and again and...","I loved this movie.Truth be told, i was a little afraid that this movie was going to be a creepy disappointment like it's predecessor The Prisoner of Azkaban. But I was more than impressed, i was awestruck. Every moment of magic seemed real, and every new character was well done and matched what i had imagined perfectly, especially everything to do with Beauxbaxtons and Durmstrang. The giant ship and flying house sized carriage were done perfectly.One major problem I had was the Quidditch World Cup, which takes up about a hundred pages in the book, and they only spend five minutes on it!A couple other things that I had major problems with were things that were just details, like they assign the name of a ""Girls Only"" school to Beauxbaxton, when in the book it is clearly stated a boy is the first to come out of the carriage. Another detail that sort of bothered me was the fact that Karakoff was younger than he was descripted in the book. But, if you don't obsess over details in books, you'll probably give this movie a 10/10",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Not what I Expected,"Harry Potter has always been my favorite books. But the movies are awful. The Chamber of Secrets and the Sorccers Stone those movies were OK not bad Chris Columbus did a fine job. But Alfonso Cuaron what was he drunk when he made that movie it sucked completely how stupid he screwed up everything it was stupid and confusing Harry got his broom at Christmas not at the end of the movie. And there were no shrunken heads either and the actors what happened to Tom the inn keeper it was very stupid in my opinion. The Goblet of Fire as not what I expected there were no house elves no Dursleys, not a lot of Severus Snape whom which is my favorite character and whom I love it was bad i guess Voldemort was good though Ralph Finness he played good.

Pulls thorugh,"After the horrible part-3 of the series, which was highly embarrassing, made no sense and pure garbage when compared to Part-1 and Part-2, the fourth film makes a sincere attempt to put the franchise back on its feet. While this film certainly views as too abridged when compared to the actual events that happened in the book, the overall effort was quite decent. The acting has certainly become worse in some areas here and there. Ralphe Fiennes does'nt really seem to be sincere as he looks unthreatening and pathetic when playing Voldemort. Not scary at all. Even so, the overall effect of this movie was very good. Although it must be said that Part-4 itself is nothing compared to Part 1 and 2.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Best one yet!,"This installment of the Harry Potter series is by far the best one yet. Now don't get me wrong, I'm a rather loyal fan of Chris Columbus'renditions but this one takes his work and matures it. The PG-13 rating is well earned and this movie is not for young children. Mike Newell's interpretation of J.K. Rowlings spectacular world is beautiful and logical. Unlike the last movie, Newell doesn't take the tried and true fans far from the original work. In fact, very little liberty was taken except to cut out what was not necessary. Also unlike the last movie, viewers who have not read the books will not find themselves confused by a lack of intelligible plot. One does not have to read the book to follow along this time. This movie has every aspect right and fans will not be disappointed. (That is, if you can take Daniel Radcliffe's mediocre acting.)",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Harry Potter,Wow! Got to see the movie on 11/14/05. It has by far been the best Potter movie to date. It's really neat to see these kids grow up right in front of you. The performances of all the main actors only get better with time as do the special effects. Although the film carries a PG-13 rating I would recommend not taking children under age 8. Reason being that some of the more frightening moments in the movie would absolutely scare a child. If you read the book you will know what I mean. There are heavier dark forces at work here so hence the scarier scenes but done very tastefully. Oh yea don't forget the movie is almost 3 hours long.,8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Best Yet,"OK OK, I know saying 'the best yet' isn't really saying much, but Harry Potter 4 has finally arrived and it was seriously enjoyable.Not only is The Goblet of Fire the first 12a Potter film, (exciting if you're 5, I suppose,) it actually scared me - an avid horror fan! (well, a bit...)TGoF starts off with the Weasleys, Harry and Hermoine trudging off to the Quidditch World Cup at daybreak. After a swirling, dizzying portkey journey, the Quidditch stadium is positively spectacular. Unimaginably high, it fulfils all of Rowling's descriptions, and then some! The movie even manages to condense Rowling's exciting, but nonetheless not-quite-as-cool-as-Hogwarts, World Cup section of the fourth book into a couple of minutes of screen time. Thumbs up! What is particularly frightening though, is the Death-Eaters march through the fleeing wizards after the Cup Final. Pointed hats, reminiscent of Ku-Klux Clan attire, pierce the dreamlike wonderworld that used to be Potter movies, and brings TGoF into a new, much scarier sphere. There is something actually chilling about the scenes of destruction that follow the glory and frivolity of the World Cup celebrations.Back at Hogwarts, Harry, Ron and Hermoine become real teenagers (moody, jealous, flirty) although, regrettably, not real actors (still sadly a bit too much gasping and a bit too little acting). Harry mysteriously gets entered into the Triwizard Tournament and the games begin with expected, but still very much appreciated, aplomb.The three other contestants; Cedric, Fleur and Viktor are perfect literalisations of their novel counterparts. Cedric is dashing, ethical and popular, Fleur is beautiful, blond and French and Viktor is rugged, forceful and intimidating. Special effects complete the package as they allow dragon-chasing, mermaid-bashing and maze-running to rival Hampton Court to exist on the Potter screen.And what we're all waiting for - Voldemort. Ralph Fiennes looking extremely worse-for-wear, does his usual superb spot of acting. He radiates evil and is pretty terrifying (especially for the little 5 year old who sat next to me in the cinema), although I think he could've done with a hood to be honest.Stellar casting has made Harry Potter movies receive a great deal of merit where perhaps they have deserved a great deal less. TGoF utilises Skinner, from Only Fools and Horses as Barty Crouch, as well as the usual ensemble of Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon, Gary Oldman (not in it for much though), Timothy Spall and of course Alan Rickman, who is quite amusing in this movie.Mike Newell, the director, obviously had to skim down on some of the books' finer details, and of course, the movies will never be as richly detailed as the books themselves, but Newell has added in a couple of factors that have been neglected in the Potter cinematic saga until now: 1) A real darkness. Not just some kiddy scare-tactics. TGoF is actually scary, eerie, tense and exciting. Not just a watered down version of all of the above. 2) Fred and George. Finally a director has remembered the hapless twins! Their comic potential has not been fully exploited yet, but at least they are slightly amusing in this movie, where in the previous films, they've been a couple of long-haired, overly-celebrated extras.Well done, finally a Potter film that's worth its salt. The lengthy run-time flew past as swiftly as a scarred bespectacled kid on a broom, narrowly escaping a particularly ferocious Hungarian Horntail.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Wish it was 2007 already!!!,"There is a saying that the books are always better than the films based on these books. I beg to differ. Only a few years ago, around the release of ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"", I got caught in the magic created by an amazing woman, J.K.Rowling. I wanted to read the book first before seeing the story on screen. After that, I knew I would be addicted for the rest of my life, though never experienced anything like that before. I suppose Lord of the Ring fans know what I'm talking about. I've read all the books, several times, seen all the films, several times, and just can't get enough of this wizard and his friends. Is there a difference between the books and the films? Of course, since these are two totally different media. It's almost impossible to film the whole book and therefore necessary to leave certain details out. The authenticity is however, thanks to the author herself, because of this, remarkable. If the first three were jewels, this one is a diamond. And diamonds are this girl's best friend. The film is a roller-coaster ride filled with excitement, humor (thank you Weasleys), tension, amazing acting performances, friendship, terror and even romance. If I had to describe the film in one word, it would be impossible. Although ""magical"" kind of sums it up.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"So Much Plot, So Little Time","The sheer size of the Harry Potter books begin to be a problem to the people determined to make them into films in this fourth installment.""Goblet of Fire"" moves at breakneck speed, clearly intent on squeezing in all the main plot elements without testing the attention span of its audience. But even to someone who hasn't read the book (I'm one of them), it's clear that much nuance and character development had to be left out, as well as several details that make the movie downright confusing if you have time to stop and think about them, which you don't until well after the movie's over.The big additions to the cast are Miranda Richardson, a hoot as gossip columnist Rita Skeeter, but who falls victim to the trimming of the screenplay and has far too little screen time; and Brendan Gleeson, wonderful as Mad Eye Moody.Grade: B",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Reliably Potter, but flawed all the same","Of all the Harry Potter films so far, this is the one with the worst problem: it is truly /the/ most poorly edited film I've ever seen. Usually, one pays little attention to editing in a good film. In a film where the plot is not well-known, the editing isn't as noticeable; this is never going to be the case with most well-known adaptations of fantasy stories like the Potter series. Familiarity with the plot points make the scene transitions seem more, not less, important. That's where this film loses me.The bad editing makes these transitions choppy and unrealistic; this becomes really obvious toward the end of the film, and almost unbearable during the climactic emotional ""ball"" scene. I could have cried as the film jumped from scene to scene, and completely lost continuity in some places. What a shame. The acting is, from the vignettes I /was/ able to enjoy, superb--especially that of Emma Watson (Hermione Granger) and Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) who gave such an emotional wallop to the romantic tension that it really hurt to watch.The length of this book probably had a lot to do with the jumpy transitions. There was an awful lot of material to cover, to be certain; however, rather than handling the excess as the first two books did, by alluding to it, this film attempts to *include* it, albeit in a really grossly truncated form, and ends up with a whole lot of bits and pieces that don't hang together! I was appalled at the opening--the horribly shortened and completely unexplainable World Quidditch Cup scenes. They teased the viewer with incredible special effects, then abruptly abandoned them in less than 10 minutes of film--and didn't look back! I was left wondering who pulled the rug out from under me. And that was only the beginning. The rest of the film followed suit, ruining what might have been a wonderful viewing experience. Even the actors looked confused. I wonder when this film is released on DVD how long the ""deleted scenes"" section will be--it /ought/ to be at least 45 minutes! Aside from this major (and truly ruinous) flaw, the film is reliably a Harry Potter film. The characters act as they ought, the special effects are fantastic (and why shouldn't they be?) and the way is paved for the next film, and the next. **sigh** Where is Alphonse Cuaron when you need him?",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Michael (shouty) Gambon didn't adopt the right tone that Harris began so well as Dumbledore.The narrative arch is disjointed and inexplicably long winded.Direction was dull and unimaginative.Production values are the only thing that save the film from being an unmitigated disaster.

The Goblet of Fire burns bright,"There was an old Mel Brooks film that I remember called The History of the World: Part I. The tag line suggested that ""from the dawn of man to the distant future, mankind's evolution (or lack thereof) is traced."" Of course, mankind's history cannot be touched in 92 minutes, and do not expect J.K. Rowling's work, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire to be given just weight in 2 hours and 37 minutes - it cannot be done. Forget the book and just sit back and enjoy what Mike Newell has prepared for your enjoyment.My anticipation was palpable: a Mike Newell film from a J.K. Rowling book. There is no film on the planet that is funnier or more touching than Four Weddings and a Funeral. Newell directed his greatest achievement there. With Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, he has taken a great leap forward and given us a movie that is enjoyable to lovers of the books and anyone else who just wants to see a great movie.I totally agree with reviewer Desson Thomson who states: Director Mike Newell and screenwriter Steve Kloves (who has written all the Potter films) know their primary responsibility: to create three-ring spectacles like the whiz-bang, airborne game of Quidditch, or Harry's mighty tussles with otherworldly creatures. But they also allow time for the characters to breathe. (WP) This film was the best of the bunch, I would not be surprised in the least to see this film exceed $100 million in it's first weekend. I was at the first showing at my local theater yesterday and it was full. I do not know what all those kids were doing out of school on Friday!If nothing else, you have to see Brendan Gleeson as the latest addition to the Hogwarts staff, Mad-Eye Moody.

"Slightly disappointing, but still good","I will not write a long winded review here, since everyone should know the book's plot by now. But of all the Harry Potter movies to come out so far, this is definitely not the best. The only problem with it is the sheer volume of information that is cut from the book. But yes, I do understand that a 750+/- would make a very long movie, I still thank that even another half hour of screen time would have made it better. You cannot imagine my sheer disappointment with the Quidditch World Cup. A lot of subplot/trivial info was cut as well, like Fleur Delacour being part Veela, the Dursleys, or Rita Skeeter pestering Harry, Ron and Hermione terribly, and Skeeter being an unlicensed Animagus. There was even extremely important stuff cut out, too. Like Professor Trelawney not prophesying that Voldemort would come again.As for the acting, I will still say that these kids are extremely impressive. The very embodiment of the series' heroes. But you already know that. The other actors in the movie are also great, with a great performance from Ralph Fiennes playing the newly resurrected Lord Voldemort. It's also unfortunate that Robert Pattinson won't be appearing any more, because his acting as Cedric Diggory was also quite strong. And I will also say that I am exceedingly happy that Cho Chang has finally entered into the Potter movie world, since she was nowhere to be seen in ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"". A lot of the movie's humor would have been lost without her.The movie has an accurate portrayal the main plot of J.K. Rowling's 4th novel. But unfortunately, the movie suffers because it doesn't really stray beyond that. But it is still a good movie, and definitely worth the ticket. (Which isn't always the case these days...)

However, Ralph Fiennes' portrayal of Voldemort is fantastic, bringing the Dark Lord to life in a chilling and unforgettable way.As with previous adaptations, some details from the book didn't make it into the movie. For instance, the subplot involving Hermione's Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare (S. P. E. W.) was omitted, as was the character of Winky, Barty Crouch Sr.'s house-elf. David Tennant, known for his role in *Doctor Who*, delivers a compelling performance as Barty Crouch Jr., and Brendan Gleeson deserves credit for his fantastic portrayal of Alastor 'Mad-Eye' Moody, bringing the character's eccentricity and toughness to life.The visual effects are impressive, especially in the Triwizard Tournament scenes. The dragons, including the Hungarian Horntail, and the underwater creatures like the Merpeople, are well-crafted and add to the film's immersive experience. The graphics throughout the movie are excellent and continue to elevate the series visually.The main cast continues to excel in their roles, with Michael Gambon bringing his unique energy to Dumbledore. The Yule Ball scene is a standout, with Emma Watson's Hermione shining on the dance floor in a way that truly transforms her character in this chapter.Overall, while *The Goblet of Fire* is a strong entry in the series, with great performances and stunning visuals, it didn't quite capture the magic I felt with *The Prisoner of Azkaban*. Still, it's a fantastic continuation of the story that I really enjoyed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Best of All the HP movies so far.,"I laughed, I cried, I was scared and I was thrilled. By far the best HP movie I have had the privilege of seeing.They did such a great job of nailing the characters as teenagers. Lots of teen angst and lots of teen humor.Harry has to face such great odds as everyone tortures him over something out of his control.Seeing Voldemort in real life was absolutely the coolest. The special effects and the way the creatures come to life is astonishing.I a sure everyone will love this movie and you should be careful taking the young children to see it. They WILL be scared. The dragon is a little more vicious than you would think.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
another fine installment,"In ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"" the fourth installment in the perennially popular series by J. K. Rowling, the young wizards seem to have a bit more on their minds than just flying around on broomsticks and casting spells. For along with puberty come activated hormones and a sudden burgeoning interest in the opposite sex. This brings a nice grown-up dimension to a series that continues to enchant young and old alike with its constantly renewing creativity and imagination.All, however, is not puppy love romance and fancy dress balls, for there is still the serious business of wizardry to be done at Hogwarts Academy. In this edition, Harry is compelled to take part in the Tri-Wizard Tournament, a sort of Olympic Games for magicians that is so intense that it has resulted in the deaths of a few of the participants in the past. In order to win the prize of the goblet of fire, the contestant must face three challenges - a battle with dragons, an underwater rescue of some kidnapped friends, and a trip through an elaborate maze, with the goal in each case being the capturing of a mysterious giant egg. At the base of the contest lies the evil Lord Voldemort (a creepy Ralph Fiennes), who is, as always, trying to eliminate young Mr. Potter by any means necessary.Although a bit long at two hours and thirty-six minutes, ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" still manages to breathe new life into a franchise that should by all rights be turning pretty stale by now. It does so partly through some really fine set pieces - i.e. the challenges - partly through the high flying imaginativeness of so much of the storyline, partly through the endearing relationships among the various characters, and partly through the performance of Daniel Radcliffe, who keeps Harry Potter lifelike, compelling and interesting as an everyman hero. The tone is also remarkably dark in the later stretches of the film, as is befitting the advancing ages of the characters, although very young children might find some of the scenes a trifle disturbing, so be forewarned.Filled with beautiful images and dazzling special effects, ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" is another worthy addition to a series that is fast becoming a modern day classic in its own right.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
This one was one of the best movies i have seen!!,"I just saw the harry potter and the goblet of fire, on the first day, thats today and first show for that matter:-). All i can say is that it was one of the most brilliant experiences of my life. The cast & crew have done an amazing job of creating the magic of the harry potter series. Everyone in the cast have done an amazing job of portraying their characters. The screenplay was excellent, considering there is a lot of magic involved with the triwizard tournament involved. I would not mind watching it a number of times continuously.The movie was just perfect. I am sure every one of you will enjoy it as much as i did. After seeing this awesome movie, i am already waiting for the next one to come out. Finally, I would like to applaud all involved in the making of this awesome magical movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Loved it,"Okay, lets start it off like this. So far, THIS is the best Potter movie! Amazingly done, Mike Newell has nailed the series! Comparing him to the other two Potter directors, Chris Columbus and Alfonso Cuaron, Mike seemed to be more familiar with the boarding school style, and has he ever done a fantasy movie before? What would you call two of his other films Donnie Brasco and Pushing Tin? Mike was pretty much a starter in this genre, and he sure pulled it off nice enough. What's amazing about this one, is that it does not focus on only ONE thing. In the previous 3 films (which weren't that bad, but still) the majority of scenes would end with Hermione saying something along the lines of ""Harry! I found another clue on why Sirius Black wants to kill you!"" No, this one added more on the maturing students, the Triwizard tournament, friendship conflicts and so on. The Radiohead guest appearance was amusing and funny to watch the Hogwarts kids partying like everyday teens. The only thing that bugged me about this was the amount of screen time for Sirius Black. He had more moments in the book, and technically you didn't see Gary Oldmans real face, all he had was a CGI face in the fireplace. A little disappointing, especially to the Gary Oldman fans. Well that pretty much covers the movie, 10/10!",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Charming but uneven Potter chapter.,"Director Mike Newell follows Cuaron's lead in pursuing darker tones and psychological under-currents for the newest Potter installment. It's just too bad that Newell's execution at dramatic points is not as good as Cuaron's. The acting is as good as ever with everyone in fine form especially Fiennes in a powerful part. Rowling's charming storytelling is still alive and well, but the characters have grown in this chapter. This causes more teenage hormones to come out, which plays against the dark, ominous fantasy. Newell does not combine the two well, so the two become uneven and lack balance. Newell gives a good effort, but he simply lacks the power of Cuaron's previous storytelling.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Best movie yet, but still could be better","I believe that this is the best adaption yet, but it still could have been better. There were too many holes at the beginning, and the producers assumed that viewers would know some things and didn't explain them (Snape questioning Harry about the Polyjuice potion came out of nowhere). I read the book just after the first movie came out, so it's been four years...I don't remember everything. I suppose some things have to be cut out when you have a long book, but you have to compensate for that. I also missed the Dursley's in this one. I hope they bring them back for Order of the Phoenix since Dudley is involved in a major scene at the beginning. Still...a good movie...worth the wait...9/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Welcome to Teenagers World,The movie is awkward.. Harry is definitely not a child anymore...,6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Not really faithful as an adaptation but good on it's own,"The book was one of the best and most intense in the series and while I think they left out too much the movie was still epic. Dumbledore bothered me the most. I mean, what? When did Dumbledore get so hyperactive? Where did that wise, calm Dumbledore go? But, about the ending, they totally nailed it! This ending is a big game-changer in the series and when you see why, you'll be shocked. After that, nothing is going to be the same again. It's gut-punching and also terrifying for children. But enough about the ending, you'll see it for yourself. CGI is great and now it really looks realistic. The dragon and underwater scenes were spectacular! And don't get me started on the maze. There are also some teen problems in this movie. Obviously, they are not kids anymore but it's really fun to see them grow up. The Yulle Ball part shows that the most. About the actors, I can only say something about the new ones because the others are great as usual (except Gambon who wasn't bad but over the top). Brendan Gleeson is great as Mad-Eye Moody. And David Tennat was scary in a good way. John Williams isn't the composer anymore but Patrick Doyle did such a great job in this one. While Williams' score was more magical, Doyle's was pure epicness and makes everything more intense. And Mike Newell, as a first British director in the franchise was great. While it could've been more faithful to the book (but then it would be really long) it's still awesome and epic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Great action and humour! But not much overall story development.,"This movie was all about Harry, Ron and Hermione. They got all the screen time. Which was good and funny at times, with Ron and Hermione having some awkward interactions. However this was at the expense of telling the overall story of good vs evil. Both in the book and in the movie the dark magic just comes in too late for me. This needs to be present in a much clearer way. Harry has the odd moment of his scar burning and his reocurring dream.But the movie seems to waste a lot of time being interested in the dynamics of the main trio. Snape gets hardly any time, Moody gets one scene teaching, Dumbledore is here and there. The champions of the tornament have literally one line each. Karkaroff has no part in it. It really is just Harry, Ron and Hermione, which is enjoyable, but limits the movie from being great!A shame to see Dobby and Hermione's scene with her wanting to help house elf's cut, alongside Harry falling on the trick step and nearly getting caught by Snape, until Moody comes along. The movie did Harry's scene with the dragon way better though, its pretty much a non-event in the book. Although they rush many parts of Harry's training and development, alongside his being coached by Sirius and just assume that Harry now knows how to do these new charms and spells from reading it with Hermione. But, the movie is already 2 1/2 hours long so something has to give right? (I'd say less of the trio and more development of the overall arc of good vs evil).Ron was great at the Yule Ball, the costume design was hilarious!Overall, its enjoyable, but not great.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Best movie of the Harry Potter series so far!,"I've only read the first book of the Harry Potter series so I believe I can say that I am not a huge fan nor an acid critic, and therefore my opinion is not biased. When the first Harry Potter movie came out I thought it was just OK. Movie number 2 was released but did not really impress me, in fact I found it a bit boring. Movie number 3 and then I really started to feel that I was on a fast moving train. Now, Harry and the Goblet of Fire is a lightning bolt! Best movie of the series so far. However, Emma Watson does not appear to improve her acting as much as everybody else. She appears way too melodramatic. Overall, an excellent movie however not recommended to younger audiences.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Enjoyable, dark but something missing","If common practice is to be observed, I should really mention Lord of the Rings and the Chronicles of Narnia for comparison when starting this review. However, I will refrain. Director Mike Newell has said that he viewed the fourth outing for Harry Potter as a suspense thriller and the starting scene certainly falls into this category. I got a genuine creepy feeling as Frank Bryce climbed the stairs of the house (and I knew what was coming!) The whole film however doesn't manage to maintain this suspense. My main criticism with the film versions of the Harry Potter books is that they are a series of (very enjoyable) set pieces. Snapshots of the books strung together with a bit of plot. I can't complain too much though. Goblet of Fire is an exciting and enjoyable two and a half hours and does move the series on. The acting from the main characters is better than before, although I'm still not that convinced by Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. The next two books in the series deal with more uncomfortable situations and issues which could make for a really great viewing experience. It will also be interesting to see how the next film compares now that Steve Kloves is not writing it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Good Movie, but I am not happy","I had really high hopes when it came to seeing HP4, but I wasn't happy with the end result.

The story went by incredibly fast, first task, ball, second task, third task.Here are a few of the things I wish had made it:The first half of the book!!!!!!!!! The letter from the Weasley's, the floo powder fascia, and the World Cup!!!!Molly Weasley, there is a great part there at the end where she comforts Harry and he feels like it is the first time someone has held him like a mother.More Rita Skeeter.Well I have had my rant, go and watch the movie and enjoy it, I did and will again just frustrated about a few things.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Great - Almost,"I think that the movie with the special effects and the way that they captured the teenage attitude was excellent. HOWEVER, I have never known Dumbeldor to be that aggressive toward Harry. I was sadly disappointed that there were several variations from the book. I was also disappointed with Snapes character in this movie. He didn't seem as menacing as in the past movies. I am also not thrilled with the actor who plays Dumbledor- definitely not as good as the original. My husband who has yet to read any of the books, loved the movie. But even he feels that he missed out on some key elements that would explain more had he read the book. I saw it twice this weekend. Definitely a great movie but not as great as the original (THE BOOK).",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
To Date the Best in the Series,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) finds himself entered into a dangerous tournament where he's not only underage but also doesn't yet have the powers to really compete. He begins the deadly game and soon finally comes face to face with Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes).I was rather disappointed in the third film in the series but this fourth film manages to be the best of the series to date. I say that because I was frankly quite shocked to see how well-made and wonderfully entertaining this film was even though it clocks in at 157 minutes. The movie is visually quite exciting but it also manages to have a wonderfully entertaining story that grabs your attention and holds it throughout the running time.What was so entertaining about this entry is that we're really cranking up the energy, the magic and of course the action. It's worth noting that this episode is a lot darker than previous entries, which is probably why this one was rated PG-13. There are some wonderfully creative action scenes on display including the three games that are played. There's a terrific underwater sequence that is full of imaginative charm and then there's the maze sequence, which turns into a terrific meeting with Voldemort.Another thing that works extremely well are the performances with Radcliffe turning in his best performance to date. This Harry Potter is the same that we saw in previous films as there's a lot more drama and a lot more character development. Even the stuff dealing with girl issues was wonderfully done. Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Miranda Richardson and even Robert Pattinson are all good in their parts. It's Brendan Gleeson although who steals the picture with his crazy eyed Moody character. The actor really brought this role to life and added so much fun to the picture.HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE is a major step up from the previous movie but also takes what made the first two so good and improves on them.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
What happened?,"OK...now i would like to say congrats to the actors because they done a wonderful job...except for the new Dumbledor...He ain't even close to Richard Harris...This movie would be least liking out the of them all so far...because they had rushed too many things such has...they had not introduced Winky, they only showed the Qudditch cup champs come in...and only showed Harry Potters dragon instead of watching the other players dragons. Plus...What happened to all of Hagrids monsters in the maze...what monsters? oh yeah...they're weren't. Come on Director... This movie mostly based on the love affairs between them...and that is not the important part in this series!

The new level of Hype,"Mike Newell is a great director and some of his movies really made me think good of him, but The Goblet of Fire is not one of them. He is the only little flaw of this movie, because he never loved Harry Potter as much as the other directors. He never read the books and it feels like he did not enjoy making The Goblet of Fire. Because of his directing, this movie made some major mistakes that triggered many fans who read the books. Still, basically every other element of the movie is a masterpiece, equally as the rest of the series. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is generally one of the best plots in the whole franchise, and the movie is made so good that it holds you focused the whole time. I enjoyed every single second of this masterpiece and I got impressed by the improvement of the acting of our main characters.

There was definitely a lack of character development everything was like event event event and just kind of lost its magic for me in the process.

Brilliant!,"Absolutely brilliantly done movie. Despite the absence of a few plot lines from the book (which had to be removed for film length requirements), the movie flows well and very, very quickly through the storyline of the book. Though Newell won't be directing the 5th movie (the directors are starting to look like the Defence Against the Dark Arts teachers in their shifting frequency) because he didn't want to deal with wrapping the 4th while starting pre-production on the 5th, I certainly hope he'll find time in his schedule for the 6th.I liked Cuaron's redirection with the 3rd movie, but I loved Newell's work with the 4th.If you're a fan of the series, I doubt you'll be disappointed...all of these actors have grown into their roles and are much more comfortable with the characters now. The new additions for the fourth film were natural, possibly due to the fact that they didn't have much in the way of speaking parts...",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

The final film infused with the childish nature of the Harry Potter universe,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005) directed by Mike Newel is a great film. Not only, as it introduces the embodiment of the great villain, Voldemort in convincing fashion, but because it - as the final film, in my opinion - was able to grasp the childish nature of Harry, Ron, and Hermione.It is very well- directed and well-paced, and contains quite a bit of action compared to many of the other films.

"Solid, entertaining movie","I think that this Harry Potter installment was a solid movie. It built off of number 3 by integrating the previous architecture and design. In this Harry Potter, the landscape plays less of a role and the director turns the viewer's attention back to the magic and fantasy of the wizarding world. The music was also well done and didn't detract from any aspects of the movie.The director is playing on the fact that most viewers will have read the book. There are some elements that have not been explained as in-depth as in the books, but that is to be expected-- there is a lot to cover. He did a really good job of the climactic scenes and in juxtaposing a lot of different elements.The only problem that I could see with this Harry Potter was the depiction of Dumbledore. The actor interpreted Dumbledore as a more aggressive and high-strung character than in the books and previous movies. I don't feel that this interpretation does justice to the core character and this interpretation needs to change for the following movies.All in all, I loved it!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

4 ... just like the first,"The fourth story stands up just as strong as the first one. Harry is put up to a challenge for which he is outmatched. Nonetheless, with the help of his friends, he manages to overcome evil's attempt to destroy him and all he knows as good.Ms. Rowling has a gift to keep the story moving, just as the producers and director have a gift for keeping the movie on the same high standard as the original. If they keep this up much longer it will go down in history breaking all records at the box office.The unfortunate thing about this series, and perhaps especially this one installment, is that they are trying to sell you the idea that ""magic works."" How unfortunate. All I can say is that I hope God opens your eyes so that you too may have the hope of faith in Christ.Excellent entertaining movie just like the first.-Zafoid PS: I saw this on cable and then got to see ""Movies that Pop"" which shows explanations and ""backstage"" information about the exciting scenes.

This is the most poorly-directed of the Potter films so far.,"Don't get me wrong. I like the Harry Potter books, and have them all. I have enjoyed the prior films immensely. This film needed to be done in two parts, or made longer with an intermission. There were entirely too many important parts left out to carry the plot. My wife, who hasn't read the book, commented that the film jumped too rapidly for her to keep up with the plot development and I very much concur.I hope that when the DVD is released it will have about an hour of ""deleted scenes"" ala Lord of the Rings.

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire- the best one yet!,"It was more ""to the book"" than the third movie, and was very funny- mainly because of Rupert Grint, James Phelps, and Oliver Phelps. Although the Ron-Hermione relationship was not highlighted as much in this movie, the movie was still great. Each member of the trio has become a better actor. There were only a few unnecessary moments that were inappropriate for younger children. Although the movie is about two hours and forty- five minutes, the length is not noticeable, especially to a true Harry Potter fan.

Felt like i was watching some 80s or 90s high school movie,"Harry Potter is the fourth movie of the Harry Potter franchise and this time Harry Potter must survive three dangerous tasks after his name gets put in the Triward Tournament. For what its worth this movie isn't actually that bad when I watched it, but there are some improvements that it could've made. Harry Potter and his friends are now teenagers then they were in the previous three films so now that they're older that means the danger and destruction has increased as we see Voldemort making his comeback and sending a message. However, I couldn't help but notice that they focused on that a lot as if I was watching some 80s or 90s high school movie. And we do get that, but it takes a really long time to get there. I feel like the writers for were split into two teams. One team creating the action and tension building and the other for creating humor, however the humor falls flat to the point where it falls flat. I know that this is supposed to be a kids movie and that you have to add some humor to the franchise so it's not one hundred percent dark and gritty, but come on at least don't try so hard. I felt that they didn't focus enough on the Triwizrd Tournament as it did deliver the danger, but they could've at least cranked it up just a little bit. I remember the book describing the Triwizard Tournament and adding details here and there that we didn't see in the movie.

Most exciting but so much out of books left out.,This one is by far the most exciting movies of the bunch.The acting is getting so much better as the movies progress which is really nice to see. They put all the main parts of the book in the movie but they left so much stuff out that it seemed like it was just jumping from scene to scene in no time the book was much better.This movie is about Harry Potter who goes back to Hogwarts where a competition is underway. three competitors from schools around the world compete in very dangerous challenges. There is only aloud 3 contestants but of course for some reason Harry Potter just has to sneak his way in there.This is the best one so far and most exciting but they leave more and more out of these movies as they go.

I have not even mentioned the most stunning part of the film. The special effects were magnificent.

Not really the best Potter-film so far,"I loved the previous films and even more I loved Joanne K. Rowlings marvelous, funny, witty novels...

Some of the best scenes were missing and a lot of the jokes were cut out. Especially the scenes during the Quidditch Championship were horribly adapted... But still the beauty of the images and the great performance of some of the cast is worth watching the film. Especially Ralph Fiennes truly outstanding performance as Lord Voldemort, which could possibly not have been adapted better, makes this film a good one.

A Movie That All Should See,"First, I must say, that Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was an exceptional movie that will be enjoyed by any fan of the series. Also, it has to be understood that in a two and a half hour film, it is quite impossible to cram in the side-stories and the tiny details that made us smile in the original novel. In my personal opinion, the Harry Potter movies shouldn't just stand alone, but the viewer must have read the book as well to understand exactly what is going on. With all of that said, let me begin.Overall, I found this film to be a huge improvement from the Prisoner of Azkaban. The acting was far better, it was still visually stunning and they were able to get across that these children that we have grown up with over the past four years aren't children anymore, they're teenagers. They're teenagers about to enter into a terribly dark world where Voldemort will stop at nothing but to regain his control over the wizarding world. Just simple things, like Hermione and Harry laughing at Hermione's ""misuse"" of words while she tried to describe the relationship between her and Viktor or Ron being absolutely mortified when having to dance with Professor McGonnagal. The adults did a good job as well. Mad-Eye's sick humor was perfect. McGonnagal was flawless as always, and I think Professor Snape, even if he said probably a total of five lines, was still a joy to see on screen. The directing, on the other hand, was a bit awkward from time to time. During the Quidditch World Cup Raid in the beginning, I was constantly going ""what?"" because it was just so awkward. Also, Neville's scene on the staircase, ending with the stained glass window, was so cheesy, even Wisconsin would've said it came from its state.One thing about this film that I'm sure nobody will disagree with me about is that it was rushed. As all fans of the book will know, that saying that there is a ton of content in the book would be an understatement. I constantly found myself trying to catch up with what's going on. The lovely transitions from fall to winter or winter to spring that gave you a chance to think about what happened are gone. They go from one event to the next immediately. I personally didn't mind it, because I have read the books and knew what was going on, but I couldn't help but feel for the rest of the audience who never even cracked a Harry Potter book, wondering if they knew that Wormtail was Peter Pettigrew (which they never explained in the last movie) and if they're going to understand a couple things in the future movies, because those issues weren't addressed in the past movies. Really, I think it's to each his own on this issue. I didn't mind how quick they went from one event to the other in a heartbeat, but to others I guess it could be terribly annoying.This is definitely what I would title a PG-13 movie. If you have a child under the age of eight years, save it until it comes out onto DVD when you're able to view it in your own home and edit it at your own pleasure. While some of the content might go over their heads, you cannot deny the fact that the idea of the most ultimate form of evil in Harry's world is back and in a very human-like form would terrify a child of four.In the end, I found this movie to be quite enjoyable. Keep the toddlers out of the theater and save it for home. The acting is quite enjoyable, but the directing is another story. Even if the movie was a bit rushed and you're an avid Harry Potter fan, go, see it and more than likely you'll love it. If you're not, more than likely you'll still love it, just make sure that you can accept that this is just an adaptation of the book and you're probably not going to understand everything immediately.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Truly fantastic plot, excellent special effects, characters seem more real...bravo!!!","From the time I sat down at the theater until the time the lights came back on and I was exiting the theater, I was riveted to the screen. And so were both of my children, ages 4 and 7. We are huge Harry Potter fans, and this was quite an engaging movie for us. I loved the addition of characters, and the wonderful action. This movie seemed more real, with more down to earth characters. I would recommend this movie to anyone, no matter the age. It was an all around excellent way to spend a Saturday. Exceptional quality, and it was very nice to see a movie where children actually paid attention, and you did not hear anyone talking. Everyone was riveted to the screen. We are looking forward to the next installment of this wonderful series!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
did the director read the whole book?,"There have been some films that have done the books justice. Top of my head, The Green Mile and Shawshank Redemption were turned into great films. And while Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire isn't a complete waste of a movie, as an avid fan of the books, I have to say I was disappointed.The film begins with Harry having a nightmare which I wont go into detail about here, as it is a key scene in the movie. Harry and Hermione are staying with the Weasleys, as they are going to watch the final of the Quidditch World Cup between Ireland and Bulgaria. It is at the final where the first significant part of the movie takes place, with those attending the match attacked by death eaters and Voldermorts symbol, 'The Dark Mark', appearing in the sky.So, with the wizard world in a state of panic over the appearance of the symbol, Harry, Hermione and Ron return to Hogwarts for their third year. Upon their arrival they are met with the announcement that Hogwarts has been chosen to host the Triwizards Tournament, and that pupils form two other schools, Drumstang and Beuxbaton, will also be taking part.The tournament involves three dangerous tasks, and despite not entering the competition, Harry is chosen as one of the competitors. All three tasks test Harry to the limit, not least the final task, which leads to a shocking conclusion.A good film overall, but a lot was left out from the book which I felt would have made the film even better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
character development,"This is a great movie for those who are looking for a mixture of humor and fantasy, and of a somewhat darkness. However, for a movie like this, you need great character development. Despite all of the excellent acting, i didn't quite FEEL for any of the characters,maybe a little bit, but it didn't quite hit the spot for me, especially harry potter. Unlike the book, there wasn't much of a build up of the relationship between Harry and Dumbledore, Harry and Sirius.They could've added 2 more minutes of dialogue from the book that are extremely vital to the series, and 20 more minutes of scene's to build on harry's relationship with characters other than his two best friends, Ron and Hermione. Also a lot of the scenes were a bit rushed, and some scenes didn't connect with each other. Readers of harry potter books, such as me, would be really disappointed due to the fact of how a lot of the book wasn't followed. On top of that, a few key characters were left out. i understand that David Yates had to shorten this but there are ways to add 20-30 minutes to cover some really important stuff. Don't get me wrong, this is a great movie in a non-reader's, (of the book), view but i think David Yates could've added 20-30 more minutes to satisfy the larger portion of viewers, who consist of ppl who have read the book. There's a major difference between the viewers of the movie, there are those who have read the book and those who haven't, so i'll give this movie two different rating in my rating system. As a reader of the book, let's say 3 and a half out of 5, great movie, just short of excellent, not near solid. In a person who hasn't read the book 4 out of 5, excellent movie, just missed being a solid movie!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Almost perfect,"First of all, a pat on the back is due to everyone involved in making this movie because there is no doubt that it would have been a huge task and it was quite well done. In this movie the students of Hogwarts have discovered the joys of puberty and the complete embarrassment and grief that it can bring you. Young Harry is faced with the looming Tri Wizard tournament and the dangers it could and most likely will bring. Harry Potter fans will notice a few main characters missing and the story slightly altered, but it's all for the good of the cinema..right?That being said, there were some things that bothered me about Goblet of Fire. Emma Watson (Hermione) was very dramatic this time around and most of the time it was very unnecessary. Rather than conveying an emotion, most of the time she just came across as a sulky pubescent teen. Also the film has a very disjointed feel to it. Scenes felt unfinished and short and the transitions between scenes just felt too choppy.Okay enough with the criticisms, I did enjoy the movie apart from what's mentioned above, and the director made sure that it was action packed as possible. I have to say I was pretty tense during the first task even though I knew what was going to happen. A massive amount of credit is due toThe movie looks beautiful and the cinematography is breath taking. All in all, ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" is a well scripted, finely acted (mostly) and beautiful looking movie. I recommend it to Harry Potter fans as it contains all the thrills and excitement you expect from one of these movies, despite a few let downs, it's definitely worthwhile watching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Could have been better,"A very entertaining film, but my feeling is that it fails to bring all the threads together in the end. There are several glaring omissions in the storyline, which will be readily apparent if you have read the book. I thought that it was a complete waste of time introducing the character of Rita Skeeter (Richardson), with whom very little was done. Dumbledore (who should really be called Bumblebore by this time) is very superficial throughout, leading me to wonder if it's directing or just Gambon's performance. I know the book is very extensive, but in all fairness to the film, in order to sell the story, maybe Warner Bros. should not be so afraid of giving it the Peter Jackson treatment and stretching it to over 3 hours instead of 2.5. I was left wanting more in the end, feeling a bit dissatisfied.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Probably the best Harry Potter movie so far,"I've read the first five Harry Potter books and I liked probably the most this 4th one. First I thought that this movie can't be good, because the book is so long and a guy like Mike Newell was supposed to direct it. I personally hadn't any objections against him, but I was prepared to the worst after having read these forums.Now, when I have seen the movie, I can say that this one is definitely the best Harry Potter movie. Steven Kloves did a great job again in screenplay, Mike Newell succeeded to make probably the best direction of Harry Potter movies so far (I hope you get the point) and the main actors (Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Rupert Grint as Ron, Emma Watson as Hermione, Bonnie Wright as Ginny and Matthew Lewis as Neville) have become pretty talented actors. Of course the interest of the plot affects to my opinion about this film also.Newell had collected the movie very wisely. All the most important scenes had been included to the movie and they had been made in more entertaining and interesting way than in the early Potter movies. The side actors had been chosen very well also. Katie Leung as Cho is as beautiful as I had imagined, and Stanislav Ianevski and Robert Pattinson are almost made to act Victor Krum and Cedric Diggory. Now I'm just waiting for the DVD release with a massive collection of deleted scenes and some other documentaries.So even though you didn't like the early Potter movies very much but you liked the books you should see this movie. I think it's pity that Mike Newell won't direct the following Harry Potter movies, but I hope that David Yates would make The Order of the Phoenix as good as this became or even better.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Very Enjoyable,"I am a HUGE fan of the books, which can either be a good or bad thing when it comes to the movies.Now, I am going to be a bit critical, but not because it's a bad movie. Just expressing some of my frustrations with it.It is always very interesting to see a movie of a book you have read, just to see how each scene and character is adapted and see it played out as it did in your head. That is the fun part. But it can also be frustrating when the movie leaves out a lot of the plot. In this particular movie, some big plot points and even a few characters that have crucial parts in the books are left out.That said, it was still a wonderful movie. I think people could enjoy this whether they have read the book or not. It explains everything it needs to in order for the viewer to understand what is going on and has a fast pace. This is also much more engaging than the last ones, some of the scenes are just fantastic.The acting is great and it is so fun to see all of the characters grow up.But just a few points of the movie that weren't my favorite: 1) It seemed a little ""dark"" to me. Not the story, because I know the story is supposed to be dark, but actually just the lighting and the filming. Sometimes it was just to hard to see stuff, and was kind of depressing.2) I didn't like that they don't develop the character of Harry as much as they do in the book. I wish they could have a way of showing what he is thinking. To me, it kind of seemed like he was just this happy-go-lucky guy for most of the movie, just smiling and having some fun. But this isn't how it is in the book at all. Harry is a very troubled character, and I wish they could show this in the movie better.3) Dumbledore is not at all how he is in the book. In the book Dumbledore is a very calm wizard and never raises his voice or anything, but several times in the movie he yells and even grabs and shakes Harry. It is just so completely opposite of the character in the book.But really, despite my frustrations it is an amazing movie and certainly worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
I just saw the movie and...,"...this is by far my favourite of the four movies! Not only of the Harry Potter series, but it's my favourite film of all time!!! The third film was great too, but this one was perfect!!! The music was fantastic, I prefer John Williams's soundtrack, but this films one didn't disappoint me in any way. All of the actors acting is brilliant!! The film was also scary, so younger kids beware. The parts that were left out of the book were cleverly weaved around to make the plot workable. My favourite part of the movie was possibly the first task. The dragon chase was scary and amazing. I highly recommend this movie to all!!! The films seem to get better and better with each film. By the seventh film, my life will probably be complete.Enjoy!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A job well done,I was interested to see how on earth any writer & director was going to manage to condense such a large novel into 2 1/2 hours of film. I think they did a sterling job. They did the only thing possible and eliminated almost all of the sub plots paring the story down to its bare bones. I disagree that any who had not read the book would be left adrift. My son hasn't read it and found no fault with the continuity and enjoyed the film very much. As the story gets 'darker' in content with each new book I was not surprised at the 12a (UK) rating and wondered if the last one will have to be an 18! :) I have no complaints to make as there is no way that you can ever do a completely faithful version of a book. How can you when you are dealing with a completely different medium? Well done to all the cast and crew for a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Can't wait for the next one!,8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
OK for the fans and non readers but directorial decisions may leave the avid fan a bit disappointed.,"In a word TERRIFIC as far as special effects go but in a word Disappointing in terms of direction. The best to date as far as big screen wow-wow and while that may leave the non-reader pleased the real fan may find the film lacking in certain areas.There are lots of changes as is to be expected when a nearly 700 page novel is transformed into film, some secondary characters are even left out, however, for the most part the changes are sensitive to the book and in the spirit of the story. The real difficulties lie in the handling of certain characters, Dumbledore in particular and the pacing of certain scenes.The acting has come a long way, improving as it does in every movie but Rupert Grint and Daniel Radcliffe have reached a greater level of maturation as actors are giving us the ""real deal"" in this one.Most of the new characters do an adequate job in support, particularly the adults (Mirand Richardson as Rita Skeeter stands out). Stanislav Ivaneski as Krum and Predrag Bjelac as Karkaroff bring life to their stock characters. Roger Lloyd Pack is good as Barty Crouch, more nervous and weird than in the book book but a lot of fun never the less.However, Clemence Poesey is miscast as Fleur Delacour. While Poesy is a beautiful girl and fine actress she just does not generate the necessary heat for a part Veela who is supposed to be able to stop men in their tracks and cause them to act the fool with a bat of her lashes. Clemence seems a bit too serious an actress for this comic relief role. A young lady of talent but a bit more curvy and with a young Angelina Jolie type facial feature would have been a better choice.The massive speculation as to ""What is Voldemort going to look like?"" is resolved and there is absolutely no room for disappointment here, his transformed self is PERFECT!!! Fiennes is brilliant and an inspired choice for the player. However, the pacing of the final scene and the blocking does not leave Fiennes much to work with, it is almost as if he is dancing about at times. The whole thing seems rushed.To the writers credit the horror aspect is given fullest reign, more so than in any other movie and true to the book because JK is bringing the reader into a time of torture, murder and doubt with a villain that will go down in history with Dracula as one of the most evil of all time, brought to life in a classic set piece of terror.Where the film runs into trouble is in the way certain characters are portrayed. As happens with so many projects, director Mike Newell seems more concerned with big screen bombast than showing a keen understanding of his material, especially the characters within. Which is rather glaring since characterization is Rowling's strongest aspect as a writer.Nowhere is this more apparent than with Dumbledore. In the film, calm, controlled, wise and confident Dumbledore comes across as a shrill, panicky, cantankerous old fart which is a shame because Michael Gambon did a more than adequate job replacing Richard Harris (who is still, however, the better Dumbledore) in the third film. Therefore I feel it is the direction more than the actor that has to be blamed for the lack of a consistent Dumbledore performance in Goblet.Frances De La Tour is OK as Madame Maxime although she is neither very comely or olive skinned as she is described in the book. Frances delivers a very motivated performance and things are fine until she eats the bug (or whatever it is) that she picks off the front of Hagrid's shirt. Hagrid and Madame Maxime are supposed to be misunderstood outsiders, not revolting freaks! The dealing with outsiders, their place in the world and their struggles to fit in is a main point of HP and to fall down in this area is something a good director/writer should strive to avoid when rendering this type of fiction for the screen.And this tongue thing they had David Tennent doing as Barty Jr., what was up with that??? Yes, I get it that they needed a recognizable facial tick to provide a give away so that Barty Sr. can see through his son's disguise. But the snake tongue thing almost made me laugh. An eye gesture or any number of other things would have served the plot better. This father-son conflict is supposed to be tragic but came across as rather silly and was wholly underdeveloped.One last thing and it is a small point but in a film where the special effects are particularly excellent for the most part it grated. What was the deal with the sleeping kids in the underwater scene??!!? Totally fake looking or what??!!? Next time Newell needs to pick out a better rubber dummy supplier. One really expected Harry to start stretching Ron or Hermione's face, jabbing Cho's cheeks or whatever. I am wondering if any of the actors had a good time punching these silly things between takes.My daughter and myself are huge fans and have read the books many times and find the film a worth while experience. Our Mom/Wife has not read the books but thought the movie outstanding. Those who want to quibble about changes and cannot accept that to turn an hours long reading experience into a movie some things must change/go will be left out. Which is unfortunate because it is a worthy watch even with some of its more rankling aspects.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Very good movie, but Not really based on the book.","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was a great book but it seems that this movie was based off of a cliff notes of a cliff notes of the book. Many important characters and scenes found in the book are missing and more importantly never mentioned.I understand that the producers can not have every part of the book but they left out several key bits of information vital to the next installment to the series.If you go into this movie with an open mind or if you have not ready the Goblet of Fire you will probably enjoy it quite a bit. The special effects in many scenes are outstanding. I think the director managed to convey the feelings of the characters well, and their interactions and chemistry are very good.I am giving this movie five out of ten because I am a real fan of the books and I was disappointed in the way the movie followed the book.Overall a good movie taken individually but not really for fans of J.K.

I went to The Goblet of Fire not expecting to like it. Boy, was I wrong! It was by far the best movie of the 4 AND the one that followed the book most closely.

"Was impressive, Best Yet","I loved all! The trio is just getting better by the movie. I love how Emma Granger is aging. She is turning into such a beautiful young women, and that really shows in the movies. Rupert Grint is also improving. His acting gets more animated, more ridiculous, and more personal in every movie. And Danial. Where to begin? His character has turned from a cute little boy, to a complex and amazing character, and he has done more than just keep up with the change. The new characters were just as good, though. There were two I was particularly pleased with, and many I still enjoyed seeing. The special effects were amazing. In a movie with three bit CGI sequences, passable is not an option. I especially loved the first talk, but I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet. I would have liked to see more sub-plot from books, for instance SPEW, and the half-giant crisis. Also more Rita articles. But the movie is still excellent. One more thing- I think the ending was too long and climax too short, but you might have different opinions. Overall, I loved it, and it was the best yet.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"not the best of the 'Potter' movies, but it's got some captivating sights and even extraordinary scenes","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire pushes the franchise into the PG-13 level, and for good reason: Lord Voldermort, played to a chillingly Gothic T by Ralph Fiennes, is much more present not just as an ominous, unnamed presence, but as a vindictive, murderous threat from the grave. He's the Nosferatu of the ""Potter"" series, but with a further sense of dread that is the unwavering sense of pure evil in such a world of wizards and magic. But Goblet of Fire isn't just about the evil, or just put-on evil by way of a curse or other dark forces at work, though it's in this that the film works usually at its strongest and most surreal points. There's a whole section dedicated to a new form of competition: get the dragon's egg in the Triwizard tournament. Some of this is compelling, mostly involving the actual under-water part of the tournament, where the suspense level isn't very high but it's highly watchable for its interesting look. How does one see ""magic"" happen underwater?If there perhaps is any significant problem, or perhaps just big gripe, to have with Goblet of Fire it's that as an emotional experience of the conventional kind it works much better on a first viewing, in the theater, where the big crescendo happens (murder is a key factor here, of a character I won't mention), and one gets caught up in the first truly significant tragedy in the series, if not the film. But on a repeat viewing, somehow, this is lessened in impact, and if anything there's certain flaws in some of the performances (a father's wailing cries, to not spoil too much for those who haven't seen the movie or read the book, are pretty poorly delivered), and even what seemed like really riveting scenes of competition- and some of the quasi-teen drama developments involving Harry's friends- seem a little more contrived or just not as interesting as before. But on the other hand, director Mike Newell finds ways to make his entry in the franchise watchable in many tight areas. Brendan Gleeson was a great choice for Professor ""Mad-Eye"" Moody, who has a look about him where, as with Rickman's Snape, you can't totally be sure what his intentions or alliances side. And there's some moments of levity thrown in in good levels of measure.But, if for nothing else, the aspect of the strange, violent and, as far as a series like this can go at this point as the mid-way movie, incredibly dark presence of Voldemort, with Fiennes's physical prowess going past the fact that he's under lots of make-up (or CGI) and pitting to the most effective villains in contemporary big-budget big-studio movie-making. To put it another way, if the last half hour or so pops up again on TV, I'll be sure to watch it all the way to the end. 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
There's a few things wrong with the film and other things,"There are a ton of things that the film cut from the book such as the full Quidditch match at the World Cup, Ludo Bagman, and a few other things. Another thing that makes me have a little hate on the film was the director (Mike Newell), he complained about the book in every interview saying it's so thick and so long, I wouldn't want a director who complains about the book. He's great with the kids and everything but he originally planned for Harry to go into the Forbidden Forest during the first task and have the dragon burn it down after it got loose of its chains, even a 7 year old heck even a person with half a brain would know this is the worst idea ever since it's Rowling's favorite part of the Hogwarts grounds and there are too many magical creatures to count. Although it is a good film I'm not saying it's complete garbage but there are a few things that make it seem like the type of movie to have some more hate than the rest. Sorry if I sound too rude but this is all just my opinion and If you have a different opinion that mine, that's ok!

Goblet makes me want to vomit with rage!!!,"Mike Newell should replace Voldemort as the Dark Lord.What's up with the 'Goblet'? In the tradition of Thanksgiving, Warner Bros. has served up a huge turkey for audiences to feast.The screenplay is AWFUL! But don't blame Kloves, who has heretofore delivered consistently good adaptations of the Potter books. What's different? Director Mike Newell.I think the term ""ham-fisted"" would be adequate in describing the translation of ""Goblet of Fire"" from book to movie. How many plot threads and important pieces of information were left out? What was up with the sudden 15-minute ""Dawson's Creek"" episode aka the Yule Ball? Where did all the slapsitck Mr. Filch and Snape stuff come from? And come on... that stupid licking tick with Barty Crouch? It had all the subtlety of a bull in a china shop. The target audience is beyond the ""Teletubbies"" and ""Dragon Tales"" stage. Additionally, there are a lot of unexplained story lines- the complete destruction of 1,000's of tents at the Quiddich Cup, Ron's anger at Harry, Harry's sulkiness at the Ball, Neville's response to the cruciatus curse, Hermione's interest in Krum, Priori Incantatem...the list is too long to continue- questions dealt with succinctly in the book- in the movie, left to the audience to decipher.People are saying this is darker and grittier- but I didn't see that. Who else was disturbed by the upbeat and cheery ending? Harry saw an innocent person die... I get the feeling that Newell, like Ron Weasley ""missed the point entirely"". The goriest and most disturbing parts in the graveyard are glossed over and trivialized. So why the PG-13 rating? Partial stained-glass-mermaid nudity?Newell also failed to pull great or even acceptable performances from most of the cast- and it's not as if he doesn't have talent to work with. You can't blame the actors- all of whom have turned in good performances previously- again, it's up to Newell to pull the great from the bad- I was often reminded of SNL's ""Master Thespian"" in scenes involving high drama. Oh yeah, I also hated seeing Michael Gambon's violent turn as Dumbledore- dude, you suck!!!Speaking of sucking- what happened to the music- If John Williams is engaged on another flick, get him back- or at least call him so he can hum a few tunes on the phone! Patrick Doyle's quasi British brass band music was weak and pathetic compared to Williams' knack for melodies and motivic development.The film also appears to have a lower budget than the previous HP movies. From the lame mer-people and the obviously fake doll-like floating Cho, Ron, and friends to the lack of moving subjects in the paintings, lack of exterior shots.. and didn't everything seem like it was on a small set- the common room, owlery, great hall, etc? Suddenly all more claustrophobic... And who could forget the deflating graveyard scenery? I've seen better mock-ups on old episodes of ""Wagontrain"". I guess they couldn't afford Winky or Dobby- maybe they should have saved a little money from the god-awful Yule Ball and dragon scenes.I guess it's Dumbledore who sums it up best- in times when you have to choose between what's right and what's easy- remember what happened to a book that was good, and whole, and interesting- that strayed into the hands of a hack director and a studio that turned movies like ""Batman"" into ""Batman & Robin""... Remember the REAL Harry Potter & The Goblet of Fire.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A Great Spectacle,"It's the Goblet of Fire with a very competent director and a fine cast. The result is a terrific movie -- fast-paced, gripping, scary, even occasionally heart-rending. After the first two dismal Chris Columbus efforts, and the good-but-not-great Prisoner, Harry Potter has finally come into his own on film. I mean this generically about the movie -- the actor, Daniel Radcliffe, continues to serve largely as the straight man for the wonderful characters and scenes around him. Whether or not he's capable of more remains unknown, as Director Newell has shrewdly kept him within his normal, passive range and thus made more of the outlandish, magical, unpredictable, sometimes terrifying world he inhabits. A note of caution, however, there are scenes that could frighten young children.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
best potter film so far,"This movie was so incredible it is hard to even know where to start. First the adaptation of this book was so wonderfully done, everything that was important or worth knowing from the book was mentioned. The actors are growing and so are their talents, making anyone fall so deeply involved with these characters. The visual effects, well spectacular is the only word that comes to mind when describing anyone of the marvelous scenes. Mermaids, dragons, enchantment all around, only some of the few wonderful things one can expect to see in this film. The suspense that exists in this film, more than any of the other films grabs at your attention through the whole movie and never lets go even to the end. The sarcasm and wit of the film stands out so much, it makes the film enjoyable for the adult as well as the child. Mike Newell kept right along with the dark theme that one saw in the previous Harry Potter film, but takes it to much greater depths. This film had every emotion ranging from humor, to fear, then jealously, and sadness, and most of all satisfaction at the terrific job done to this film. I will definitely see it a few more times because it was so far the most memorable movie I have seen all year.

Too Many Scenes Missed Out But Good Special Effects,I'm a big fan of all the Harry Potter books so far and I thought the first book to the third book were all successes as films and the new director has definitely captured a darker side of the book and i think it has improved the book. However I was slightly disappointed with his film. I loved all the special effects and the Triqwizard tournaments but I think they missed far too many scenes. For example I was really looking forward to seeing the sphinx who riddled Harry but instead Harry and Cedric simply ran through and grabbed the cup. I'm really disappointed with the new Dumbledore as he lacks the wise and respectful approach that the old Dumbledore had (excuse me i cant remember actors names)I didn't think Malfoy was shown enough or Snape and the idea of quidditch seems to have slowly gone out of the window. I'm especially looking forward to the 5th and 6th films. I've given it a 7 because it still has that magical Harry Potter feel to it :),7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Potter always great, but its just not Azkaban","Well, the wait is over. The fourth release in the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, directed by Mike Newell arrived at the big screen November 18.This year Harry (Daniel Radcliff), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) are now 14 years old and find themselves not only exploring magic, but dating as well.As the movie begins, Harry is having nightmares about devious meetings that are causing his scar to bother him more than ever before. He attempts to brush off these premonitions as they begin their fourth year at Hogwarts.Upon returning to their beloved school, the head master announces the Triwizard Tournament and introduces the additional schools that will be participating.However, due to the life-threatening and grueling tasks to be performed during the tournament, only those 17 years and older are allowed to be considered  technically this excludes Potter.The tournament turns out to be more than the school and its participants bargained for with ancient beasts, underwater demons and magical mazes. Of course, like all Harry Potters before, nothing is as it seems.Along with the Triwizard Tournament Hogwarts is hosting, also comes a Triwizard ball. This proves a difficult task for all three as they struggle with whom to bring as dates.First of all, when it comes to rating this movie, it's Harry Potter so it just can't be bad. However, this particular one just did not measure up to its predecessors.The very first two hours of the movie was great with all of the magic and conflicts you can expect from the series, but the end fell sort of flat.A few major issues that have been lingering since the Sorcerer's Stone, as well as new prominent issues, did not get the recognition they deserved. I would like to explain myself a little better, but I don't want to give away major plot points in the movie. I only hope these issues are addressed further in the 2007 release of Harry Potter and the order of the Phoenix.Overall the movie was pretty good and deserves eight out of ten stars. It's not as good as Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban or the Sorcerer's Stone, but the kids, families and Harry Potter fanatics alike will enjoy this present day classic. It's definitely one to add to the DVD collection  like all the rest.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Intense action but no sense of wonder,"Given the reviewer hype, this is a very disappointing effort: video arcade action with virtually no dialog; poor direction (new-to-the-series director Mike Newall) with characters sporadically departing from previously established personae; rife with discontinuities, insufficient context (there is a misplaced reliance on viewers having memorized the book) and bad editing; Michael Gambon's inability to comprehend the concept that Headmaster Dumbledore is supposed to be an old man, not an angry young man wearing a beard (I do so miss Richard Harris's characterization); and, not least, much of the sense of wonder engendered by the prior films has not survived.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
I'm both surprised and impressed.,"Although the previous 3 Harry Potter movies were good as entertainment, I probably never was the biggest fan of the movie franchise. The previous movies all had their flaws, mainly with the pace and character treatment. However ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" seems to do everything right, what the previous did wrong. I was surprised as well as impressed with this fourth Harry Potter establishment.The main characters in ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" are maturing and luckily so is the movie and its story. Harry Potter and friend face beside the usual problems (Voldemort, the Malfoy's, some evil school teachers) also a whole new different sort of problem; puberty. Hermione has her occasional mood swings and easily gets agitated and Ron seems to be more interested in the girls at school (especially the French) than in brewing potions. It all gives the main characters a totally humane face and suddenly makes us look differently at them and we realize that they're growing up fast now. It makes the movie a whole lot more realistic and it's easier for the viewer as well to identify with the main characters.There were several problems with the previous three Harry Potter movies. One was occasionally the pace. It was offbeat at times and there were some unnecessary characters and subplots in them. The pace in ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" however is fantastic. It doesn't waste any time and everything happens very quick and the movie feels very consistent. ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" had the problem that it took itself far too serious. It was a good movie but there was little fun and things to enjoy in it. ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" however is far more humor filled and in fact is the Harry Potter movie with the most humor in it as of yet. It are not childish jokes but instead consist out of very well constructed and realistic comical situations and dialogs. It makes the movie very entertaining and pleasant to watch, even though the movie itself is just as dark, if not darker, as ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"".Yes, this really is a PG-13 rating movie. There are some scary moments in it and finally also Lord Voldemort transforms into a far more threatening, convincing and scary, almost horror-like looking villain. He also is perfectly scary and villainous portrayed by actor Ralph Fiennes.There was always a big difference between the adult cast and young cast. Both seemed like a different separated class and they never really felt completely as a whole. This time however the young cast perfectly blends in with the adults, which is I think mainly due to the way of directing by Mike Newell. I have the feeling that previous Harry Potter directors tried to impress the viewers with the big well known adult cast that had many well known names in them. ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" however focuses more on the three young main characters and Harry Potter himself in particular in this case. The adult cast this time really play nothing more than the sidekicks of the movie and that's also the way it should be I think. The Harry Potter movies are all about the three main characters and it makes a whole lot more sense of the movie to focus mainly just on them. The screen time with the adult cast has surprisingly cut down, compared to all the previous two movies. Some people might be disappointed by this but I'm of opinion that this was the right step for the story and also the entire movie franchise in particular.But yes, of course the adult cast is still impressive to watch, they just had been given lesser chance to shine this time. I'm especially glad Alan Rickman and Jason Isaacs returned and reprized their roles. But the movie also has some fresh new names in it, such as; Miranda Richardson, Brendan Gleeson and the earlier mentioned Ralph Fiennes. They are a welcome addition to the already impressive cast list.The story itself is exciting, mysterious and fun as well to watch. The movie is perfectly constructed and also has some fine looking special effects, consumes and sets. It's a fine adventurous and more serious movie to watch for both young ones and adults, even though the movie occasionally gets to scary and serious for the very young ones probably.It does all the little thing the previous three movies did wrong, right this time. It makes ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" so far the best, most realistic, most thrilling and exciting Harry Potter movie yet.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Excellent Film,"Out of the previous three Potter films, this was the film I was looking foreword to the most as Goblet of Fire is one of my favourite Potter books. The pictures and trailers made this film seem fantastically brilliant and the film lived up to the hype.What I really noticed is the improvement of acting from the young cast. Daniel Radcliffe greatly improved on the dramatic scenes, his crying was cringe worthy in PoA and I was very happy with his performance in the graveyard and the aftermath of it. Rupert Grint has once again managed to take his character to where Ron needed to be. For the other three films Ron was the comical best friend, but in Goblet of Fire Ron matures and becomes more angry, and Rupert performed this act flawlessly and he still managed to remain humorous and sarcastic. I was most disappointed with Emma Watson's performance with Hermione, her acting is slipping and she sounded as if she was going to burst into tears even when there was an extremely happy moment and was nothing to cry about.The new actors were fantastic. Robert Pattinson as Cedric Diggory was spot on brilliant, although we didn't see much of Mr. Diggory but when we did see him Robert portrayed Cedric flawlessly and was a real joy to watch until his tragic demise. Stanislav Ianevski was pretty good, it would have been nice to see more of his acting skills, but from the little bit I saw he seems to be a decent actor and I hope to see him in other things after Potter. Same with Clemence Posey, I've seen her in other things and it was a treat to see her portray Fleur Delacour, she's not only beautiful but she can act.I did have some things I was a bit upset with. A lot of the book was cut, and I knew somethings had to be cut for the sake of timing, but the film was very choppy and it seemed to leave some gapes that should have been filled. Barty Crouch Jr. was played by the brilliant David Tennent, but his character had a lot of holes and his whole purpose was un-explained.I give this film a 9 out of 10, Watson's acting and some of the missing parts made this film a bit enjoyable, but overall this is the best Potter film yet, I laughed, I cried and nearly screamed at some parts. Hope film five keeps the Potter legacy alive.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
This is the best  Harry Potter movie yet.,"It's a very good movie in which the special effects are great and the actors seem really in touch whit their characters.Although the ending was a bit unusual because i thought that Harry will remain with Cho, Ron will remain with Hermoine and Lord Voldemort will be stopped but even so this is the best Harry Potter movie out of all the other three movies.I think that in comparison with Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Askaban this is a lot better and without a doubt a very larger success than it's other three predecessors.Now I can't wait to see what Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix will bring because i wanna see what happens with Harry and Cho,Ron and Hermoine and what happens to Lord Voldemort.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Harry Potter and The Goblet Of Fire:The Doc's Review,"I liked this film and went to go see it even though i hated the book and wow good movie.More mature and darker story lines are involved in this amazing Harry Potter film.The special effects are wonderful,the acting is fantastic,and the storyline is superb.It's been long awaited ever since the first film was released and boy does it ever live up to it's hype.This topped off my weekend and was definitely worth seeing.I'll be checking my computer daily for any DVD information because this is a worthy addition.My only problem is that Malfoy i wanna smack that jerk in the face.Anyways The Goblet Of Fire is ranked #2 on my favorite Potter flicks slightly behind The Chamber Of Secrets.Worth watching.Harry Potter hasn't gotten stale as rumours of this being the first Potter flop are completely 100% false.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Okay,"All those Harry Potter movies were just okay. The books were funny enough, and all the movie adaptations were decent and satisfying. I'm not a big fan of those book, but I liked them. Daniel Radcliffe was a very good choice as Harry Potter, he is very handsome and talented. The performances, the script and the special effects were good enough, not as good as better films as ""Avatar"" and ""Watchmen"", but were good. My only problem with all the Harry Potter films is that all of those movies are pretty long. Since those book and movies are aimed to children they should be shorter, I guess. All the Harry Potter films are good, but I still prefer ""Avatar"", because ""Avatar"" has aliens, and I love aliens.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Brilliant but Fast Paced,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is my favorite book in the franchise. For that reason, am I a little bit hard on this film? Probably.There is a lot of subject material to get through in this movie (37 chapters compared to 17, 18 and 22 in the first three films respectively) and it shows. The film is incredibly fast paced and a little jumpy. While the Triwizard Tournament is exciting, the quiet moments with the core 3 are lacking.That being said, this is still a Harry Potter movie, and I could watch these films on a loop. The story is full of misdirection, exhilarating stakes and one of the best finales in the franchise. I find myself bawling my eyes out during/after the graveyard every time.This movie raises the stakes and brings the world of Harry Potter to the next level. I love Harry's response to Hermione's question, ""Everything's going to change now, isn't it?"" He, like the audience, knows that there is no turning back now.Best Character: Fred and George Weasley
Best Scene: The Graveyard
Best Quote: ""Dark and difficult times lie ahead. Soon we must all face the choice between what is right and what is easy."" - Albus Dumbledore
Best Piece of Score: Harry in WinterAdditional Note: Dumbledore is so frustrating in this movie. He is aggressive, brash and not the calming force that he is supposed to be. He finally calms down in the dormitory scene, but for the most part, I found myself missing Richard Harris.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
disappointing,"The director of 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' taking over the Harry Potter series? One would expect some of the humor and good-feeling atmosphere of his previous movies to find somehow place in the teen-Gothic series based on Rowlings nooks. What is happening is quite the contrary and to a somehow a disappointing result.The good things to be said about this fourth installment in the series are about the effects, masterly integrated into the movie, serving well the overall atmosphere and color. I should rather say lack of color, because the world of 'Gobblet of Fire' is much darker and less exuberant than the one in the previous series. The principal characters matured, and the world is much less a universe of childhood masterly taken over by good and bad witches, but starts to look like the threatening world of adults where the destiny of any child is to arrive. Acting is good, the original casting proves itself and the three main actors do not disappoint, but age is doing its work, and we are already in pain believing that the heroes are only 14. Interesting to see how this will be solved in the next series, re-casting may become inevitable.The main problem of 'Gobblet' is the story itself, which fails to interest and lacks continuity. It may be that if we say the previous film one week ago we would remember better what the villains are about and how menacing they really are. It's however two or three years later now, and the result is that we do not really remember why the bad guys are bad, what is Harry's family story, the mature seem too much like a parody, and the terrible things that are supposed to happen on screen look cartoonish and fail to involve the viewer. In the balance between the teenagers angst and the dragons-witch stories it is the teen story that paradoxically looks more interesting, but then, that much money put in a teenage growing story seems to be an excessive expense.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Disappointing,"I really think the recent Harry Potter movie was very disappointing. I went with a die hard HP fan and he actually hated it, I give it a lil more credit. The formula for the movie seems to the same for the HP movies. It's the same sequence in the events, the events just change. I especially noticed that in this, the movie felt rushed and choppy. This may be due to the 800 pages or so, they had to squish into a 2.5 hr movie, which seemed very long. The special effects seemed just OK, like the other ones. The acting was also very mellow dramatic. I really like the third one, because of the contrast of greys and blacks, and interesting light. It was also very dark, which it should be. This was just a comerical dive with one point: get the point across, and impress the viewers. When did movie making become like that. It should be about breaking new grounds.Some things i did like include the were the light jokes, and the underwater scene, and not to mention and unbelievably hot Emma Watson (take it from a teenager). So kinda let down :/",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Richly imaginative, darker and scarier than most of the other Potter films...","DANIEL RADCLIFFE and his company of wizards are having the scariest ride of all in this dark, dangerous and yet fun-filled thriller with absolutely stupefying special effects and some slam bang cinematography that is nothing short of dazzling.Readers of the novel may quip at all the material that couldn't be included, but the movie is extremely well-paced with a fair amount of humor to liven up even the scariest moments. The story is a lot less complex to follow than some of the others and lets you concentrate on the rich assortment of characters with almost Dickensian names.MIRANDA RICHARDSON does a nifty job as an overly exuberant journalist who exaggerates her tabloid material (by the name of Rita Skeeter), and Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson do their usual superb jobs in their by now familiar roles.RALPH FIENNES does a chilling job as Voldemort for the final maze sequence which makes it questionable whether parents should let the very young watch this without fair warning. He's the meanest, darkest villain yet in all these Potter stories and does a brilliant job of being villainous.For Potter fans, this should come as a welcome chapter in this series, extremely well directed and acted thanks to a superb cast and crew. Patrick Doyle's music is a good background score without being too obtrusive.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
It was definitely worth waiting for!,"Well I might over-reacted with the voting but, it is due to the fact that I am such a big fan, and also under the strength of the impressions of just returning from the movies, after taking the whole exposure to magic.I can not say that the Goblet of fire is the best book of the series, it somehow lacks the strength and the activity of the characters of the Order of the Phoenix, but still exposes to the best of light my favorite two characters. The first one of course being Harry Potter and the second as always, and for me naturally, Minerva McGonagall. Having the three previous movie adaptations of the books for hundreds of times, since I have the DVDs at home, I can say that I consider this as the best, although there were somethings that I lacked.The first two films were necessarily adapted to suite to the children, as they were considered as the primary audience, and they were, but as the characters grow and develop the audience changes and the actual happenings in the story develop to a different level more likely followed with the film as such.As of the very beginning up to the very end I enjoyed this film (Mike Newel brought something more adequate for the story - British, and finally he turned it to the stream it should have taken instead of the one that Cuaron wanted to lead it to). The first two, although a bit to much adapted to the younger audience and with more innocent approach, were definitely better in the sense of adaptation, since the third brought it to much into modern times and left the all British issues like school robes, rules and discipline that the students are supposed to have in a school such as Hogwarts being a proper English boarding school. There is an extreme quantity of effects that were conceded although the film was not made darker in any sense as it was with the previous one. The scene with the dragon was according to my taste a bit to exaggerated and thus made less attractive, unlike the second task which was offered to the viewers as reality. However I lack the difficulties and the dangers of the third task since the film offered us no more then the maze it self.The actors on the adult side were more or less up to the challenge, of course, knowing that we speak of the most talented bunch of British actors that we have seen, while the strangers were very bad. Pedja Bjelac, I am sorry to say, was to stiff, and was like reading the lines from a card and speaking them in front of camera, while Stanislav Ianevski, although from the youngsters, with the three words said into the film does not deserve the efforts by the producers to go casting in Bulgaria. All the praise goes to Maggie Smith since she was the best in picturing the character of McGonagall as she really is described in the books. We saw Alan Rickman and Michel Gambon, possibly in bringing to us the worst of Dumbledore and Snape, but if this is a school then we should definitely see some more professors. Gleason looked to me like some oaf and although got the character right I think that Moody should be played by someone more agile who could prove to be up to the job of dark-wizard catcher not only by his magic abilities but by appearance to.The younger cast are improving by the minute, but in this movie I so somethings which I shouldn't have like Ginny with no words at all, and Nevile at the most marvelous of his. Dan is the best and acts as a sponge by acquiring the most of positive experience from the grown-ups.Nevertheless, the film did lose some points on a few issues. First, the Dursleys and the arriving of the Weasleys. The accommodation in the boxes during the Quidditch finals, and the finals themselves, if they were supposed to be omitted then they should have been omitted fully, and finally Molly Weasley should not have, I repeat, should not have been omitted since she plays a vital role for the emotional part of the movie and the upbringing of Harry. Her presence on the final task should have been most awarding for this side of the film. I personally being a cry baby at films, was on the verge of crying but there was a simple lack of emotions and a person dies, or worst was killed.I do recommend to every movie lover to see it, in all the artistic senses it is worth seeing it, it is not just a part of the series. For the book lovers as I am I recommend that they accept the ""film"", not necessarily the adaptation.Finally, thanks to the whole team for the Christmas present.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Espresso cup of flicker,"As a major fan of the Harry Potter books and the first two movies, I have to say that this, like Azkaban disappoints. This movie lacks the energy and enthusiasm of its predecessors.Enormous chunks were cut out of the book, including major characters, sub-plots and parts of the main plot. The bare bones of the book plot were left in and even then there was quite a lot of disconnection. A few new story threads were added to make some sense of the overall story post its radical surgery. There was no understanding of time and pacing through the movie; for example the Quidditch World Cup being held in the summer holidays; the fact that the Triwizard champions were supposed to have one task per term. Other characters were cut back to a cameo at best: Sirius, Snape to name but two. I appreciate that a novel needs editing to take it to the big screen - I loved the treatment of the first two movies - but this seemed like butchery.My other criticisms: 1. what was going on with Dumbledore's (Michael Gambon's) accent? One minute he was from South East England, the next from Yorkshire, the next from Ireland. At one point I thought he was trying to impersonate Richard Harris! 2. Daniel Radcliffe really needs acting lessons. He is getting worse with each movie. He seems to struggle with expressing any subtleties of emotionThings I enjoyed: 1. The special effects are superlative, especially the scenes with the dragon. Harry's interaction with the dragon was excellent: very creative and entertaining. 2. Rupert Grint is getting better and better as Ron, managing more subtle humour with his very expressive face. 3. Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort and the whole scene in the graveyard. I felt that this was very true to the spirit of the book and the portrayal was suitably sinister.If you are an avid Potter fan, you still *have* to see this movie.

Wonderful...but I was still Disappointed,"OK, I am a HUGE harry potter fan - I go to the parties, I stay up for the new books/movies, I've read all the books over 40 times, I had a HP themed party for my 25 birthday...and I have always enjoyed myself. That didn't change with this movie - for the most part.I was completely enthralled with almost every aspect of this film. The acting improves every time, the special effects were amazing, and - even knowing what was going to happen - I was on the edge of my seat for half of it. This movie is - to me - more than just worth seeing...it is one of the MUST SEE movies of the year (a comment that I don't say often). OK, that being said - I want to express some disappointments.First off, I know that book four is huge, and as such it was almost impossible to fit everything in; but, even still, they cut some intricate parts that have me wondering how they are going to be able to tie together the fifth movie. There were no house elves, no SPEW, there was a huge hole with the whole Ron/Hermione/Victor issue - in fact, it seemed that she would go for Harry throughout the movie - and, on top of all that, Barty Crouch was just randomly dead...no explanation, no story line, nothing, we just saw him dead in a field - that was it. And those are just a few of the things they left out. My biggest objection however, was Gambon. I have mode always said that I didn't like Sir Gambon as DD, I never have - he just doesn't do it for me. But in this movie he was angry - almost violently so with Harry for most of the movie. That just ISN'T the DD that those of us who have read the books have come to know and love, and you end up losing some of the movie just trying to figure out why he is behaving that way.However, all of that aside, whether you are a die hard HP fan like myself, or if you are just beginning to get into the books/movies, you must go see this movie! You won't be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Not bad but...,"Overall, I liked the film but just couldn't get over the feeling that they cut too much from the book. There were a lot of characters who didn't appear. For new characters that were included, they didn't seem to have much depth. In fact, even some of the main characters other than Harry lacked depth. This book in the series is supposed to show a major transition in the adolescent development of students, but aside from the fact that they're obviously older, so much was either minimized or left out entirely. This was inevitable given the length of the book, but even so, I felt that there was just way too much missing. I hope that they'll do an extended version with a lot more scenes added.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Both, best and worst of the series","This time i was surprised with the result that WB gave me. And again, i say that i don't care how much was cut out of the original book. I am taking this as a film, not as an adaptation. Yes, this one definitely is darker and more adult, bet are they going to say that before every HP movie? Of course, but with time it will stop working, and HP will be making barely 300 000 000 dollars, because this film was already PG-13, which is pretty silly, because HP is already a kids classic, and now it is stolen by an attempt to attract more people to the theaters. I would call that a brutal attempt to make extra $$$. But, dammit, it works! Now, i will tell you why this film could disappointing for those, who also take this as a film - first of all, the acting. It's not really terrible, but it's not convincing. And how D. Radkliff got to one of the top spots of the IMDb ""Best And Worst Polls of 2005"" as best actor, is beyond my understanding. It is just impossible for 16 year old to play a 14 year old! YOU CANNOT FAKE PUBIRTY!!! Radkliff should have understood it. The same goes to the other actors. And now we come to the special effects. Same old, same old, one year CGI, which will seem really crappy after a few years or so.

Growing Up Hogwarts-Style,"The Harry Potter film franchise takes off with another wizardly tale of growing up at Hogwarts with all of its interpersonal banter and dark underpinnings.Watching the young actors age on the screen is probably becoming one of the more satisfying things for me. It makes it seem more ""real"" even though this is just a fantastic fantasy.Coming back to the wizard school this time, we see that Ron, Hermione and Harry have hit their growth (and hormone) spurts. Dancing, love, friendship, and danger are now forever linked as we're introduced to the Goblet of Fire TriWizard competition. Normally set as a triad competition (between three individuals of different schools) this time there will be four contestants, obviously including Harry. Angst and anger are the melange of the day as Harry has to deal with his lack of knowledge about the competition and grapple with his growing affection for girls his own age. Oh yes, and he's still be chased by the evil Lord Voldemort (the wizard responsible for his parents' death and the unusual scar forever emblazoned on Harry's forehead).Harry's not old enough to compete in the competition and his fellow Hogwartians aren't happy with the fact that Harry seems to be outgrowing his own shoes. Is he too cocky? Harry never entered the competition and doesn't know how his name got picked but his fellow classmates don't believe him.As the Goblet of Fire contest continues, we see Harry battling dragons, saving one friend but unable to rescue another, and then meeting face-to-face with true evil.Perhaps it's the dark qualities of these latest Potter films that drags me in, or perhaps I'm just a fan of the genre (junky?), but whatever it is, I find the dangers and limited successes of Harry and his friends comforting and realistic (not overly done with a ""Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes"" attitude). This one's rated PG-13, too, so keep an eye on the kiddies.Like the Prizoner of Azkaban, this one has very dark over and undertones. And clocking in at two-and-a-half hours, it's one of the longer in the series but well worth the sitting time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Truthfully enjoyable!,"When I was about to see it I was worried, very worried. I had read on beforehand of what was gone, and I was prepared, but as the title came I could not breathe (my leg couldn't stop shaking either).Well, truth be told I enjoyed the movie immensely, and there were no dull moments. The music was fine, but I did enjoy the Yule Ball music the best. Every scene was used to full effect, and I enjoyed especially the fact that we saw several places used in the third movie.There was much more humor in difference to the third, that was especially dark, but this one managed to blend in all. It was rather quick paced at some time, but it managed to capture you even so. Each task where presented very nicely, and I felt that many of the characters were more used here. In this one we could enjoy Fred and George's humor, which has been sorely missed by myself. So watch it, it is worth your time!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Wow!,"You may never quite see a movie quite like this one. The constant worrying of how well Mike Newell will do on this movie is now over. Mike Newell took his own route on this movie, though still building off what Cauron and Columbus did, yet improving it. All book readers will still be surprised by what this movie has in store for them since it separates the books from the movies.The movie starts with the necessary Voldemort/Wormtail scene and quickly changes to the amazing and breath taking look at the Quidditch World Cup. It quickly shifts to the main story of Hogwarts and the Triwizard tournament.All aspects of the teenage life are shown throughout the movie from love, quarreling, and schoolwork. This gives the movie a more realistic feeling and shows that these wizards are normal people, but with magical powers.Characters such as Mad-Eye Moody, Fleur Delacour, and Rita Skeeter were cast perfectly to the parts.All the action scenes were amazing and actually thrilling with top rate special effects. All three magical tasks are exciting and believable. The graveyard scene was all that it should be and quite frightening which made this movie earn it's PG 13 rating.My only words of criticism is this. More time should have been spent on the Quidditch World Cup and the three tasks instead of having all the unnecessary time spent on all the Yule Ball.

Who cares what the reviewer said?,"This movie was amazing. It was the best by far. Also, unlike Prisoner of Azakaban, it actually included most of the important parts. The length was just perfect, it could actually go longer.There are only two things that i do not like about this movie.They are 1) Dumbledore- he just isn't as regal and stately as the first two movies Dumbledore. He is more of a hippie that is trying to act dignified instead of being that way. But, then again, i complained about that after the last movie.2) Mad-Eye Moody- It wasn't the actor nor the acting. That was great. It was how they made him look. The eye annoyed me. It wasn't supposed to look like that.Other than that, it was amazing and all the teenage girls (including me) in the theater swooned when Daniel Radcliffe is in the bath. He's Been WORKING OUT!!!!! Also, Cedric is looking fine!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Short and to the point. (the comment, not the movie)","I'm not going to blather on like so many other reviews seem to, I'll try to keep this short.Goblet of Fire was a good movie that could have been great. Too many people forget that movies are not books. It's my opinion that Prizoner of Azkaban is the best Potter movie, simply because they stripped the book down to the essence of the story. When things needed to be changed to make the movie better, they did.I'm all for boiling things down to their core, changing necessary bits around a little if it helps the adaptation be a better movie. Something Alfonso Cuarón did a superb job of when making HP III. However, in IV it seemed as if they went back to cramming in everything they could into the script, despite leaving out half of the book (including the character driving parts of the story). This cut and paste effect was reminiscent of movies I and II, but even more so, as book IV is longer than books I and II combined.As for the one major thing they did change from book to movie, it not only didn't help, but in my opinion hurt the plot, pacing and, I feel, made things fizzle out by the end, though part of that is J.K. Rowling's fault in the chronology of the original story. That plus an unsatisfactory denouement force me to give it a six out of ten.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Better read the book first...,"I am a little disappointed by this installation of the Harry Potter series. I have not read any of the Harry Potter books, but I completely enjoyed the first three movies. With ""Goblet of Fire"", I found myself confused, especially towards the end of the movie, because I did not know the significance of everything that was going on. I have had to seek out my nephew who knows all the books by heart to explain why something happened. I still enjoyed the movie, and I liked the darker tone of the film compared to the other 3 movies. I will have to either read the book or wait for the next movie to fill in some of the gaps. Maybe the fact that the book had a lot of subplots that needed to be cut out to fit into one movie took away from the cohesiveness of the film. So as a non-reader of the books (that is my loss), I give the movie a lower score.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Get Over It,"This movie was killer. I know that there are people out there that get all agitated because certain things get cut out and whatnot. But that doesn't make the movie any more or less good. This movie was the best on thus far. In fact, they only get better with each one. The first two were good, but they were very kiddie-friendly. With the characters becoming teenagers, the stories have matured and become darker. Yes, there are things that are cut out, but this will always be so. If you've read the book, forget all about it while watching the film. Just view the film as if you had never heard it before. You will find that it is a remarkable film. The characters are as dimensional as they need to be. The story is told well. And who really cares if Dumbledore shakes Harry. It's not in my character to shake people, but if it were me, I would have beat Harry down. Yes, it's out of character, but it's not out of the question. This film is great. Go see it if you haven't already. If you have, go see it again. If you have read the book and keep comparing it to he book, go back and see it over and over until you can view it without comparing it to the book at all. You will find that this is one of the best films of 2005. Now I can't wait for OotP.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

It was awesome!,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was an awesome movie. Daniel Radcliffe portrayed Harry extremely well. He conveyed the anger, stress, frustration, confusion, joy, and all the other emotions Harry feels throughout the movie and book. Emma Watson and Rupert Grint also did a fabulous job as Ron and Hermione. The chemistry between the three of them was completely realistic. The rest of the cast are equally talented.

"A must-see, a you're-crazy-not-to-watch-this for the book's readers","The movie is about Harry Potter's fourth year in Hogwarts and that means we're going to see more troubles. It's so nice to see the kids growing up, especially the Weasley twins. They are the clown of the show and their appearances on screen are awaited. This year's highlight is the occurrence of the Triwizard Tournament held in Harry's school. Students from other wizarding schools came to compete. When Harry became one of the contestant, people's reactions varied from envy to worry. He had to work his way on this without the usual help from his pals. Meanwhile, he was also haunted by his recurring nightmare about Lord Voldemort.What stands out from this movie was its intenseness. You barely had time to blink. I got a little nervous waiting for this movie because Alfonso Cuaron did a great job with the third movie and I was wondering whether or not this one will live to the expectation. But this movie turned out to be so much better, because without further ado it just moved on a high speed presenting the story of the amazing things that happen in Harry's magical world that we loved. These include the Quidditch World Cup that was so exciting to see.We know that Harry's life at this point is more difficult than it's ever been and the story itself has been developed into a more serious phase, but somehow Mike Newell managed to deliver the funny scenes brilliantly. It was wonderful of him to put that amount of fun in this supposed-to-be-darker Harry Potter movie and still finding ways to make the movie as dark and scary as it supposed to be. Even though, due to the movie's speed, sometimes the nuance of one scene was so different than the next and when I wasn't ready for the change yet, it got me a little confused emotionally.As for Ralph Fiennes, all I can say is, on the scene where Voldemort met Harry, I, indeed forgot that Harry's even there, maybe it's the charisma that did it, whether it's Fiennes' or Voldemort's. And I personally think that, the shots the camera took several times on Radcliffe (who was only squirming) while Fiennes was delivering Voldemort's words to other characters were simply to remind us that Harry was there and important to this scene as much as the villain was. But on the other hand, if the situation was created on purpose, and audiences were supposed to forget about Harry at that moment, the job's marvelously done, big thanks to Fiennes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
I felt as if I'd already seen it,"When I saw this film with my family last night, I couldn't help feeling that I had already seen it. Unlike many film sequels, it doesn't leave me with the feeling that I've been handed a grab-bag of leftovers. It was well acted, with excellent special effects, and even having a horde of middle-schoolers wielding cell phones and darting back and forth to talk to one another in front of us didn't keep me from enjoying myself. I've just seen it already.Emma Watson is, as always, excellent, and Rupert Grint's eternally astonishing face is a gem. Daniel Radcliffe, as always, has the unenviable job of being the unwilling and not-particularly-distinguished hero, and acquitted himself well. The directing was good.

Better than expected,"I consider myself one of the harshest critics of the Harry Potter films - unlike everyone else who seemed to adore the third one, I myself was left uninspired - but I think that this was very good considering how material they had to fit in, and was the best of the lot.Daniel Radcliffe has improved (much better crying than his emo rant in PoA), and Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are also very good. Newcomer Brendan Gleeson as Mad-Eye Moody also fits in well. However, I still haven't warmed to Michael Gambon as Dumbledore - he acts completely unlike the Dumbledore in the book, and never gives off an aura of being particularly wise or of being the most powerful wizard in the world.Of course, cramming all of the story into a 2 and a half hour film is quite a considerable task, but I think they did it better than in PoA - it followed a much more structured storyline, and while the pace did leave you feeling a bit ""... Huh?"" at times, it didn't seem to just be showing the main plot points, like in film 3. Some of my friends were sad they cut out SPEW and most of Rita Skeeter, but I agree that while they're great in the book, they don't really have much point in the film.The Yule Ball is incredible, and deals with their teenage emotions properly without making it seem like an episode of 'Saved by the bell', and, as expected, each of the Triwizard Tasks are spectacular. And the final dramatic confrontation, while not quite how I imagined it in the book, was actually surprisingly creepy and a little disturbing - not good for little kids.The only thing I'd say about it was its lack of subtlety. I know they have to fit in a lot of plot points, but did they have to make some of them QUITE so obvious?? Even the weather seems to be trying to alert the trio that evil is afoot.All in all, I liked it, and I'd definitely recommend it to HP fans (though they'll hardly need my encouragement) and even to those who didn't like the last three films - this is in an entirely different tone, probably thanks to the director Mike Newell, who not only being British and understanding our school life but also predominantly a romantic comedy director, managed to inject some much-needed humour into what is otherwise the darkest of the four yet.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Mostly GREAT!,"Okay, I'm a HUGE Harry Potter fan. I loved this movie, BUT there were some key points that I felt missed the mark. First and foremost, I truly think that Michael Gambon is not capturing the true essence of Dumbledore. Gambon's emotional performance (too much so at times) lacks the strength and compassion that Richard Harris so effortlessly exhibited. Also, the way they chose to create Sirius's image in the fire is definitely not how it is described in the book. That along with the lack of his presence in this movie, was a big disappointment. I also would have liked to have had someone comment in more detail about Neville's parents, and the pain he's gone through. It seems as if those who have not read the book will not have the same connection with Neville's character and vulnerabilities. The last subplot that I feel was sorely missed was that of the triwizard tournament winnings (the money) and Harry's choice of where to spend it (or give it). This is a subplot that leads to so many other important connections, that if they are all eliminated for the next movie, we fans will be greatly disappointed. They SHOULD present the next movie in two parts. It's just too much good fun to cut out!!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Too condensed,"This movie was the only Potter movie to disappoint so far. It's not that the directing wasn't great. It's just that, in order to cram that big book into a Hollywood time frame, too much had to be dropped. Moreover, the background scenes in the beginning had a choppy look to them--it almost felt like they were going through with a razor blade and shaving off frames at the end of it to make their time. The overall effect was far too choppy to quite enjoy as much as I have the last few. Even the climactic scenes just felt like they never quite resolved. The director should have just split them up into two movies like he was originally intending. Besides, that way they'd make twice as much money.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
what a disappointment,"I find it quite surprising how such a visual book can be so poorly made into a film.Prisoner of azkaban in my opinion was the best so far and I guess it all comes down to a good screenplay and of coarse the director.Which is another surprise for me;mike Newell has made really good movies,what happened with harry potter???

Not bad at all,"I give the movie seven stars. It did what it was supposed to do, and it did it well. The third movie was spectacular AS A MOVIE, but this was simply a well done adaptation.From the very beginning, I thought, ""Oh my goodness. This is not John Williams."" This was unfortunate as the score lacked the cohesion with which the first three films were blessed.Moving on. The acting is fine, but I felt at times both the script and the direction were a little off. Some dialogue just didn't fit together like it should. Hermione would say something, and I'd just feel awkward about it. To be fair though, all three of the teenage trio had some absolutely phenomenal moments.The pace at the beginning was enough to make anyone dizzy. So much was happening and so quickly, I felt as though the film makers were being too careful to include EVERYTHING in the book and at the expense of the cinematic effect. I felt like I was watching a book and not a movie. What's more, the middle of the movie, the dance that is, actually began to drag! I can appreciate exploring adolescent awkwardness, but it felt as though the one stupid dance took up a third of the movie's running time.As much as I can criticize the movie, the final climactic scene was near perfect. Ralph and Rupert stole the show. I was terrified and mesmerized. Still Harry was pried from Cedric's body the confused pace continued.Enjoyable? Yes. As good as Azkaban?

"Good, but could/should have been better.","The Goblet of Fire was one of my favorite books in the series, but the movie does not capture the magic of the book. My feeling was that the film was rushed, and very brief. They failed to elaborate on the characters and the plot The first 150 pages in the book are compacted into 10 minutes of film, and the yule ball(which is not an essential to the plot)was drawn out and boring. Snape, McGonagall, Hagrid,Malfoy and Dumbledore all have small roles, and they give the best performances out of the whole cast. Moody was well portrayed, and so was Voldemort(although he looked like something from Men in Black). Some characters were completely cut out of the story, such as Dobby the house elf, and Ludo Bagman. Finally, I think that Harry, Ron, Fred, and George should all get haircuts because they look doofy with that hair.

I mean don't get me wrong, it was a good movie, but it just flat out didn't live up to the book. I loved the special effects with the dragons and the mermaids though, also the scene with Voltemort in the graveyard was pretty decent. I was just disappointed on how many details were left out about many key creatures and characters that come on later on in the series and what make the book so magical and entertaining, such as the sirens, as they never mentioned. The maze was very poorly done I would say too, all it was was a harmless maze with a bunch of attacking bushes and branches. Where were the creatures like the blasted-ended srewts and the boggart? The most disappointing thing I would have to say though was the conclusion. in the book it set up a great cliff-hanger, the movie didn't.

Its very Greek Drama,You really need to have read the books to understand this movie.

Its like Greek drama in this fashion - Greek theatre goers knew the beginning middle end and continuation of every comedy and drama that they watched - just like the majority of the people who went to see this film. Its a great visual expression of the book and it particularly captures the stumbling panic that Harry felt competing in the Goblet of Fire with everyone pushing at him from every angle (better even than the book did). The SFX are awesome and i loved the Hungarian horntail. They removed the exact right elements to translate the book and make it work on the big screen.

He was always afraid never seemed to be confident. Hermione was less ecstatic in this movie and her role was very much minimized. New characters have added spice to the movie with fresh talent. Too much hype was created before the movie was released. But it failed to sustain the hype. If it had been any other ordinary movie from Hollywood, i would have rated 10/10.

Harry Potter Flies High,"Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire book has won millions of hearts with its great storyline and imagination. J.K Rowling has done her part well as an author, creating such beautiful imagination with one thing in her mind: Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived. And thus creating more books on Harry and his adventures which Christopher Columbus chose to helm this book series to the big screen. Though he has chose not to film the 3rd book, Alfonso Cuaron took the director seat and made it the worst of the trilogy(only had 3 HP films at that time.) I'm so glad that Mike Newell took the 4th book and portrayed real good on screen.It is Harry's 4th year at Hogwarts and this year is special because Hogwarts is about the hold the Triwizard Tournament with other two magic schools, Beauxbatons and Durmstrang. Whoever wins gets the Triwizard cup. Only 3 champions are chosen in the competition but Harry turns out to be the 4th champion. Harry nearly died in all three tasks. In the end, it turns out that all of these events are planned by an evil wizard.Actors were excellent in their roles. Really superb. Newcomers like Robert Pattinson(Cedric Diggory), Stanislav Ianevski(Viktor Krum), Katie Leung(Cho Chang), Clémence Poésy(Fleur Delacour) were great but the director didn't gave much time to the audiences to generate the characters of the other 3 champions and Harry's crush. Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson acting's were great and Rupert Grint's Ron was the eye candy actor of the film. Most of his scenes were filled with humour. Alastor Moody, Brendan Gleeson, was also great. Ralph Fiennes as the evil Voldermort is convincingly fantastic.The setting of the film were also great. The Great Hall, the Prefects Bathroom and Castle of Hogwarts(outside). I have only one thing to say: WOW! Dragons, big and small, were terribly great! They actually built a 40 foot long ""Hungarian Horntail"". The soundtrack were also fabulous.One flaw of the film was that some of the parts weren't explain in the end. It's like you ask a question and that question was never answered in the end. It's frustrating for the people who never read the books.There's only one thing to say to those who haven't watch this exciting film: Go and catch this film!",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
While a great fan of the books; I consider myself almost an enemy of the movies.,"Well I cannot hide it. The movie was extraordinarily horrific. Not only have they chosen to cut out 70% of the book (I am not a mathematician so don't get anal about that figure), but they have also chosen to change, even omit, certain details when adapting the book.Firstly there is the opening sequence with Frank Bryce being murdered in the Riddle-mansion. According to the book only Wormtail, Nagini and Voldemort are present apart from Bryce. But Barty Crouch Jr. is for no real apparent reason also in the room with them. This removes an entire storyline. It is no longer possible for us to discover how Barty Crouch Sr. has staged his own sons's death, it removes Winky from the story and also the episode at the Quidditch World Cup. Which reminds me, what happened there? The match wasn't shown, Ludo Bagman doesn't appear ( and his wager with the twins disappears as well ) we are not introduced to the Veela and so we cannot find any reasonable explanation as to why Fleur has such a great effect on Ron. The other Weasly brothers are not shown ( Charlie should have been there to take care of the dragons ), Amos Diggory is not given a chance to talk so much about how good his son was against Harry in Quidditch ( and Cedric at first seems somewhat arrogant and not at all like he is depicted in the book )and believe me I could go on. I never understood why they were not in the 'fancy' box at the World Cup, and why O' why were we not allowed to see Narcissa Malfoy?As for the acting I still think the first two were the best in this respect with the first one as a clear number one. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson carry out their roles in a manner above acceptable. Daniel Radcliffe should be sacked and thrown off the set. I do not wish to resort to mudslinging but he is dreadful in this movie. He was good in the first two, halfway decent in the third, but in this his acting is downright poor. He delivers his lines with almost an air of indifference, pay close attention to his reaction when he returns from the encounter with Voldemort, he is supposed to cry but he is not convincing. His performance makes Steven Seagal seem a right Lawrence Olivier in comparison. Michael Gambon is normally a highly regarded actor but it pains me to say that he has no business playing Dumbledore. Richard Harris made that character come to life. He acted the part so brilliantly that I truly believe that they should have stopped after his death. Michael Gambon does not portray Dumbledore as well as Harris. Sometimes he seems even weak, off balanced and not in control. In essence he does not portray Dumbledore but someone posing as Dumbledore. (That's the way it seems). The other actors perform adequately but nothing more.I was also surprised at the absence of communication with Sirius and equally surprised at his physical absence at the end of the movie (as he should have been there according to the book).There are numerous other flaws, mistakes, changes, omissions, etc. but I will not bore you with them all here. Bottom line is that this movie is right insult to the books. The story is much too quickly paced, the storyline of the movie leaves one wanting to know more (the things one wants to know were actually revealed in the book), and the story is generally uninteresting. As a whole the movie is not worth watching and by the Force, do I wish I hadn't. Biggest disappointment was, however, Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort. I have no words for this atrocity they call acting. Fiennes is generally a brilliant actor but his performance in this movie should be forbidden by law.In fact, the creators of this movie should sit down and say: ""Crap! We naused it up, lads. Let's call it a do-over.""I give it 1 out of 10 but only because there is no lower grade. This is possibly the worst movie of the last decade. And yes, I saw Deep Impact.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Best of the HP movies so far,"The Goblet of Fire was the worst of the Harry Potter books but it has been made into the Best of the Harry Potter movies by a large margin. Maybe the simplicity of the underlying story in the book (despite the book's inordinate length) has made the transition to screen easier.The movie has an excellent balance of special effects and character development. For the first time Daniel Radcliffe actually shows he can act the part and the other characters are all on the right notes both teen and adult alike (Mad-eye Moody and Rita Skeeter are perfect).This is the only one of the HP movies that I would be happy to see again. HP 3 (Prisoner of Azkaban) did have the right tone (particularly with Lupin and the Dementors) but Radcliffe still couldn't act and the difficult final scene was far from satisfying. HP 2 (Chamber of Secrets) was a loud mess of special effects that had me and my kids fidgeting with boredom with about 30 minutes still to go (although Dobby was well done and Kenneth Branagh was good as Gilderoy Lockhart). HP 1 (Sorcerer's Stone) got some things seriously wrong in addition to Radcliffe's weak acting, most noticeably a lack of whimsy and a far too sinister take on Harry's first encounters with wizarding at Hogwarts; John Williams soundtrack was particular inappropriate and overblown in those scenes. Richard Harris seemed far too weak as Dumbledore, too, even in HP 1. (Maybe it was his health.)

What is more disconcerting was the centrality of that relationship to the movie and the changes that they are experiencing and the relative superficiality with which that was covered.For example, the stress between Ron and Harry and Ron and Hermoine were only treated in the blowups between them but no depth was ever given.

The biggest issue for me was the change in Dumbledore's character. I think Michael Gambon is a great actor and I do like him as Dumbledore (although I miss Richard Harris). I understand that Mr. Gambon is acted the part as written, but felt the character is far removed from the one in the books.

I felt permanently detached from everything, I even started to count the Carpet tiles on the Celing. So much was wrong with this film!!! A real let down!! For anyone not acquainted with the Harry Potter Book series may find this film very disorientating and jumpy, those book fans out there will realise that they have chopped and changed the story around, and, as you will all be glad to hear, left all the good parts out.

Somewhat Of A Dissatisfied Fan,"After watching Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire, I was somewhat disappointed. I expected there to be much more. The Quidditch World Cup wasn't even shown. One second, the game is starting, and the next second, it's already over. I found the movie to be fast-paced and somewhat of a disappointment due to how much was taken out of the movie. In some parts of the movie, a scene that took up 20 pages in the book only took 5 minutes in the movie. Before watching this film, I had thought that this would have been my most favorite Harry Potter film made yet. But sadly, I rather enjoy the previous film. Don't get me wrong though, it's very well put together and is a must-see film for all Harry Potter fans. I just expected more from it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"No Surprises, Unfortunatel","At 41, am baffled to be so intrigued by a set of ""children's books."" I mean, my tastes run from Shakespeare to Raymond Carver. Right now, I am reading ""Les Miserables."" These books are truly amazing.Unfortunately, despite the gee-wiz(ard) effects, the movie is sorely lacking in almost all the elements that made the book impossible to set down. (I remember when it was released. I read it in almost one sitting). There is all the action, of course, but none of the drama. Where is Harry's frustration? It's as if the story were so big and unwieldy to convert to film, that all the major elements were only ""paid homage"" to. For instance, Cedric and Cho Chang. What happened to them? We see her crying at the end of the movie, but after a couple of hours, there wasn't enough story to make me care!OK. To be fair: as a movie, it does work. It is highly entertaining, action packed and because of the previous movies, they don't have to work too hard to get us to care for the main characters.

Good but could have been better...,"Saw the movie last night (18 hrs ago) and was pleasantly surprised by the relative maturity of the movie.

Maybe the quality of the movie hall wasn't so great but the movie appeared to have got a dark touch to it.Overall, still not great but much better than the earlier ones.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Why oh why?,Spoiler alert This is probably the worst to date of the adaptations. Though visually astounding I mean did they had to devote almost 15 minutes to the ball when in the book was briefly described I mean even the after party. The movie loses the feeling of the book The other 3 champions were the best of the best of their respective schools truth be told the only reason Harry passed most of the tests was because Voldemort wanted to take him out of Hogwarts and fake Moody was helping him in the book he clearly reflect that he had to be out of his mind to compete against older already OWL certified wizard. In the picture the other champions as depicted as fools almost as clueless as Harry.

Unggoy for life.,"Harry Potter seems that he cannot be defeated in anything. And this movie proves such an ideal. Potter/Radcliffe is entered into a tournament for wizards of a certain age. However, Radcliffe is not of that age, but is allowed to do it anyway.You get to see Radcliffe having to battle through the ""Triwizard Tournament"". Its a decathlon-type of match spaced out over several days. And Potter, despite being at a disadvantage, is able to score special points here and there and able to go to the final round. That comes of no surprise. After all, its Radcliffe. He can always win.Voldemort, the main antagonist of the film series, is for the first time seen with a full body to fight against Radcliffe. And while the battle is 1-on-1, Radcliffe doesn't seem a match for him. Thus you, as the viewer, are not surprised Radcliffe wins the tournament.Its another OK film to watch in the Harry Potter series. You have descent acting, average script, and good visual effects. Seems to be the formula for success. ""C+""",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Fun Teen Drama,"This particular installment of Harry Potter is fun to watch but expect a lot of teenage drama. I like the idea behind it - instead of the 3 main characters (Harry, Ron and Hermione) had some bad blood between them for awhile - made it more realistic. Despite enjoying the tension between the characters I feel this one is missing somethings - one of them being a better story.The story: Someone has put Harry Potter's name in the Goblet of Fire - not only does he participate in the Triwizard's Tournament but he must find out who and why they did it to him.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

The following aspects of this movie are very wrong: 1. the story, a person who hasn't read the book can't follow and a person who has thinks the movie's worthless. 2.

One book-One movie. Good idea?,"Don't get me wrong. I liked the movie. But there is just too much in Book 4 to cover. On the contrary, there isn't much in book 5, or it is possible to cut out more from Book 5. Book 4 has more commercial movie making material. I remember the plot had not gone *anywhere* for the first 150 pages or so in Book 5.Frankly, I would have preferred Book 4 spilling into the next movie for about a 3rd of the movie. Movie4 could end at Task 1 with Harry's Dragon fight as the finale. In spite of some comments here, I liked that part. You need not follow the book to every last sentence. You can take some creative freedom.They could have released the movies within 7-8 months of each other, that would have kept people interested.

"Exciting, but missing a lot from the book","This movie is exciting with great special effects and acting. For someone who has not read the books, it is a great flick with lots of action.For anyone who has read and loves the books, a lot of things are missing or changed. Some of that is to be expected, given the length of the book. Unfortunately, some of the things left out, although not important to Goblet of Fire, are important to the continued story line that goes on in Order of the Phoenix. Dumbledore is also not true to character when he reacts violently to Harry's entrance into the Triwizard tournament.I love the books and did enjoy this movie, but some things could have been better. Perhaps this should have been done in two parts or as an extra long movie with an intermission built in to allow for more of the things left out to be included.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
One wonders,"One has to wonder for whom this film was made. Certainly not for fans of the book, who were disappointed to see how badly it was adapted. As for the rest of us, well, since we don't tend to be HARRY POTTER fans in the first place, this choppily edited, disjointed, CGI-heavy kiddie adventure tends to leave a very unsatisfying taste in the mouth. I honestly am not sure who would want to see this. Whatever money it makes, it presumably makes off of those who read the book, and few others. And those who read the book are not likely to recommend it to others, nor be repeat viewers. I predict the studio is going to experience a dramatic downturn in the box office take on the final three movies. (An easy prediction, actually, as I am a former film reviewer.) Also, the leads are becoming less appealing as they grow older. And it doesn't help that the replacement (Michael Gambon) for Dumbledore, the school chancellor (Richard Harris, who died right after the second film was shot), is an absolute dud.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
An Impossible Task?,"Rowling's book, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, carried the series into a whole new dimension - that dimension being the thickness of the volumes. Almost twice the length of its predecessor this mega-tome was always going to be problematic to condense into a watchable movie. For my money, Mike Newell's result is a valiant, but predictably rushed and uneven affair that will leave fans of the series disappointed at what was left out, but that will also leave newcomers (if there are any people still in this category out there!) bewildered as to what on earth is happening. The movie felt exactly like the edited highlights of a much longer movie that had been roughly pasted together. As a side effect of having to race through the story, there is no time to develop any real depth in the characters, which is unfortunate. (In most cases, anyway: with each new episode I grow ever more irritated with Daniel Radcliffe's wide-eyed and mumbling performance as Harry.) Interestingly, the one character who displays any real passion is Voldemort, played by Ralf Fiennes, and I look forward to seeing more of him.In summary, not the best of the series so far (that honor surely goes to Cuaron's Prisoner of Azkaban), but not a bad effort given the challenges imposed by the book. I'm hopeful that a decent movie can be made out of the next book, which although it's even longer, has in many ways a more straightforward storyline (and more things that can be cut). 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Like a fine wine, the series is aging gracefully.","Oh, God, where do I begin? Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the fourth installment from the J.K. Rowling series and this one is the payoff. Not only does each of the series keep getting better by installments, but they also get darker as well. As I mention in my review of Prisoner of Azkaban, the first two installments were ways of getting gawky eyed teenage girls to the big screen; with Azkaban, it was a movie where EVERYBODY, fans and non fans, to see this flick. With Goblet of Fire, the results are more promising than ever.Daniel Radcliffe returns to his role as Harry Potter, a little older this time, and having nightmares about Lord Voldermort A.K.A. ""You Know Who"", as the scar on his forehead is getting worse as he can see what his happening around Voldermort and his cronies.Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are also back as Harry's friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, in which time the three characters are hitting the stages of puberty where the guys don't have a clue on how to pick up girls, while a student from another school asks Hermione to the ball on Christmas Eve. Not only does puberty hit them, but also at the same time the relationships start to hit a conflict where Harry can't count on neither one anymore.The premise of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is that every year there is a tournament called ""The Tri-Wizard Tournament"" where a student from Hogwarts and two other students from different schools (Beauxbatons Academy and Durmstrang Institute) compete for the Tri-Wizard Cup, which will lead the winner eternal glory. The contestants have to be over seventeen to compete in the tournament, which involves retrieving a golden egg from a dragon, saving a loved one from the black lake, and the last part of the competition is going to an endless maze where somebody gets the Tri-Wizard Cup. The way the student is chosen is if somebody writes the name of the contestant on a piece of paper and sends it to the Goblet of Fire where the names will be drawn. Three have already been chosen, even a student from Hogwarts; but now a fourth contestant is revealedHarry Potter. Part of the clause on the contract reveals that no matter what, if the name is drawn, the player must go through all the levels, even if they die.As far from directing, Mike Newell of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""Mona Lisa Smile"" is the first British director in the movie series where as a Britain, he understands everything about a boarding school, even a scene where Prof. Snape (Alan Rickman) starts to hit Harry and Ron upside the head for not doing their work. Yet, so funny and realistic that he does an outstanding job making this film.Goblet of Fire also draws strong supporting roles; there's Michael Gambon reprising his role as Dumbledor; Maggie Smith as McGonagall (more of an extended role than Azkaban), Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, Miranda Richardson as the slimy Rita Skeeter and Brendan Gleason as ""Mad-Eyed"" Moody, who is the fourth teacher in the dark arts after the three other teachers left (Prof. Quarrel was Voldermort's apprentice in the 1st movie; the fop Gilderoy Lockhart in the second movie; and the eccentric Prof. Lupin in the 3rd installment).Harry does meet his match with Lord Voldermort (Ralph Finnees) before the end of the movie which is quite a surprise, because after the first three films, the first two were apprentices in the body of Voldermort; in the third film, it was revealed that another apprentice ""Worm-Tail"" Peter Pettigrew (Timothy Spall) was responsible for the death of James and Lily Potter; and now the monster is met, incomplete, with the face of the mechanical droid from the movie ""I, Robot"" where Voldermort's eyes are small, his nose small and his body very alive.This is the first Harry Potter movie to be Rated PG-13, because of dark elements and scary violence. It does a job of staying true to what it means. Not to mention coming along with a storyline that people can follow. Overall, this is one hell of a movie, and as Hermione says to Ron and Harry, ""Everything is going to change.""Indeed, for the better.Acting: A+ Plot:A+ Directing:A+This is a must see for every wizard and muggle.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The best Potter yet.,"Everyone, this is the best Harry Potter yet. Everything you want, there's more of. You have to be focused to understand some of the narrative, but it all pays off. The Goblet of Fire is easily the most intense and most involving of all the films yet and I, personally, do not envy the director of the next film. What makes this film greater than the others is that Harry tackles everything in this film. From his friends, to relationships, and to his greatest fears, Harry's screwed at from all sides. I would be surprised if you, as a Harry Potter fan, did not enjoy this excellent film.We begin at the Weasley's home, where Harry and his adopted family go to the World Cup of Qudditch where everyone's greatest fears are soon to be realized.From the beginning, you notice this film is much more British than the rest of the series. I love how they handled the World Cup, the Tri-Wizard Tounament, the Yule Ball and the return of Harry's greatest foe. Everything is realistic and near exceptional. Excellent job on the parts of 'MadEye' Moody and Voldemort. After four films, the series has not had one let-down yet. By all means, you must watch this movie.

"Wow, what a let down.","Let me just start by stating, I love all the potter movies... all except this one. That out of the way, here's my synopsis: Acting and character portrayal -- Decent. Most of the movie seemed like it was done on take one. The actors seemed rushed in their parts to finish lines, but overall not too bad for a harry potter movie. (although much different from the previous movies.) Casting -- Some of the new characters looked way out of place, but i guess there wasn't really anything wrong here..Plot line -- Wow. This was a problem. Most of the book was left out. that would be OK i suppose, if the plot remained the same. the other movies were different from the book and i didn't have a problem with them. this one somehow really just didn't work. It seemed like most of the plot was left on the cutting room floor, or maybe just wasn't filmed at all... which brings me to:Directing -- Honestly, this is the reason I gave this movie a 2. The director obviously didn't want to film the kind of movie that the harry potter movies are and should be. Instead, this one was really mostly a comedy, and I'm not sure how he accomplished it. Most of the good bits were rushed or skipped completely, and NOTHING was explained properly, if at all. The only reason I knew what was going on (or what was suppose to be going on) is because i have previously read the book, and even then i was confused a little. I was sure to remember the name of this director, and believe me, I'l never pay to see another of his movies.In closing, I'll say this: The book is not at all an action novel. It was not meant to be so. If you want to direct a pure action movie, Mike Newell, please do it with the appropriate material. I really feel awful abou this series now. There's 1, 2, and 3, getting better as they go, and hopefully 5, 6, and 7 will do the same. Then there's 4 stuck right in the middle with no continuity and no point.

Purchase the Books after this one,First let me say that I have seen all four of these movies. and By far this was the best Film out of the four. I was not much of a Harry Potter Fan till I saw the first two But this one turn me into a believer. I love it so much that I bought the hardcover 6 pack. After reading the Book I see a few things were missing but overall it was still a very Good adaption. Though the Dragon Scene plays out better in the Movie then it was written in the book. And the Maze scene is not as exciting as it written in the book. There are some key elements missing from the books that is explain in the dialog of the movie so you have to listen carefully to everything that is said But overall it is still a 12 for those who have not read the books.

Although I do think that they did leave out a few very important parts and changed a few parts in ways they shouldn't have. But for the sake of not spoiling the movie for others I wont reveal parts that they should not have changed or parts they did.All in all to summarize I would say its a movies worth getting on DVD and seeing in theaters at least once.

Sometimes not knowing is better....,"I've never written a review (or anything like it), nor have I ever written a comment about a movie, so bear with me a moment. I feel I have a point to make, and it may change how you see this movie, and yes, it all depends on if you've read the books or not. I'll be honest, I only read the first book, didn't really feel an overwhelming need to read the second. Good story, good premise, just no desire. To tell you the honest truth, I am very grateful that I stopped at the first. Why? Because by reading the book, perhaps I would not have liked this movie as much as I did. You know the fans, you hear them all the time, they are not happy with the adaptation. They read the book, and are mad that a few things were left out, or this didn't get enough time, and you can't blame them. They fell in love with a story that gave precise details. What I fear has happened is that although they know the story inside and out, it has made it so they could not fully enjoy a truly masterful film. You know what I speak of, during the dragon trail, the book readers all remember what happened in the book, and it put a filter on how much they can enjoy what is on screen. It could never be done good enough. However, I did not read the book, and as I said, I am forever grateful of this. If I had, it would have taken away from the unknowingness I had going in. This movie is unbelievably tense, dark and full of poignant themes. It shows what true evil can be, it takes us back to when we were slightly younger and it lets us actually feel for the main character by ourselves. What I mean by that is, we know the characters so well, we understand them, we no longer need to have it explained. And we finally understand that by the end of this series, Harry will need to lean on those around him, because no matter how great he may be, he is nothing without those that care. I feel bad for those who come home from this picture and can't help but be disappointed. It's really not their fault; one's adaptation is another's disappointment. Yet believe me on this, this is a great film. As I put before, this is the Potter film that makes you want to see the next movie, right away. The true dark tone is finally here, the evil has finally come, and the characters are reaching the breaking point. And if you let it, this film will make you care.

Gambon didn't do his homework.,"It was great to watch magical universe which I drew in my head while reading the book visualized on the screen, AND it is more magical, more imaginative, more colorful, and more dynamic than my imagination. However, 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' feels like a collection of short clips. Each sequence seems disconnected, not fully developed, ended abruptly, and moved to next sequence so hastily. I understand it's more than difficult to have all the stories in the book, but connecting each story can be smoother. Michael Gambon as Albus Dumbledore is the worst. He did not read the book for sure. Adaptation from novels can change the story based on director's convenience and preference. Totally acceptable. However, changing the character's characteristics without any justification is no-no. Dumbledore should be calm among anything. He is a father figure in the book, but he is a worked-up Tournament referee and narrator in the film. Gambon's Dumbledore is angry, loud, and maniac all the time. He almost ruined the entire work.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"worst of the potter movies, severe disappointment","OK it wasn't a bad movie just as a movie. My bias of being a huge Potter fan (especially of the books) lead me to the feeling that this movie was a train wreck. The Goblet of Fire was perhaps the best book of all of Rowlings. In my opinion it was the most suspenseful and throughout the story it was full of action, romance, humor, suspense and MOST IMPORTANTLY a mystery. Yes the best part about the story is the mystery surrounding the man who put Harry's name into the Goblet and what the motivations were behind it. Which no one knows until the end when imposter Moody is revealed.THAT is where my biggest disappointment is. they almost entirely butchered the Crouch storyline and it was left unexplained. The story as it goes on becomes a more suspenseful mystery as clues are thrown out that could lead you to the conclusion that Moody isn't actually the real Moody, he is a fake and that he put Harry's name into the Goblet. The most important part of the books was about the mystery. The movie it was mostly about Harry's tri-wizard adventure, romance and as much humor as they could put in.Look I wont complain about the triwizard tasks although the first task was severely dramatized(in a good way in terms of the casual audience perhaps), the third task was completely messed up. In the book it had everything it was an amazing chapter in the book and in the movie it was a bunch of ATTACKING branches.Next up....Voldemorts return. Horribly rushed. If they had put in more to that scene and less to the stupid Yule Ball then it would have been terrific. The graveyard scene was so rushed but not as much as the shrieking shack scene in PoA.LOOK, it wasn't THAT bad from a casual viewers opinion, actually pretty good. But from a huge fan of the books it was a mess in my opinion and it really hurt to watch again. The best book in the series is matched by the worst movie of the series.

The best Harry Potter film and one of the best of the year,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is one of the best films of the year and the best Harry Potter movie. As I fan of the books, I knew I had high hopes that this movie would great despite all the changes. I was not disappointed. Newell and Kloves do an excellent job translating the 734 page novel into a two and a half hour movie. The theme, despite being the darkest yet, has some humorous parts that balance the movie well. The performances by the three young leads Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson was amazing and captured the teen angst of the movie, as were the performances of the other young actors. The adult performances were done well, especially Brenden Gleeson who was amazing as Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Mad Eye Moody. As great as the performances were, the special effects are equally amazing. The three tasks and the epic climax will leave people in awe at not only how well done they are, but for fans of the book, how well they are translated. If there was one disappointment in the movie, if you could call it a disappointment, was the music. Patrick Doyle's score was good, but it was no John Williams. All in all, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was an amazing movie that is a contender for best film of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Below my Expectations,"Now I will start this off by saying that the movie was without a doubt good, but for reasons I will name later on you will realize why it is that I gave this movie the score you see above.Going into the theater to see this movie I was expecting 2 and a half hours worth footage of a movie based on one of the best books I have ever read'. I feel I didn't get this, or anything near it. The movie started off great giving me the feeling that there will be a very dark feel to it throughout the entire two and a half hours, but later on I discovered that this was not the case.I think much of the movie was wasted to show what was happening with Harry and Cho Chang and other small parts in the book, rather then spending the time on more important parts such as the fight at the end, or the quidditch world cup at the beginning. The set for the quidditch cup was great and just when I was expecting a good action-packed part of the movie the scene switched to everyone celebrating and that was a huge disappointment. The whole movie after that I feel was made up of ""incomplete"" parts put together to form what was a very rushed movie and even taking in consideration that if they were to make this movie better it would have to be a lot longer I am still convinced that they could have improved it in many ways and still have it less then three hours long.Overall I give this movie a 6/10.

It has been a mammoth task for Mike Newell and his crew to put together a 500 page book into a 2.5 hrs long movie. And he performed the task admirably. Whereas the first movie, was pretty good, the second disastrous, the third being a good once but kept the hardcore book fans wanting for more, this one would surely fulfill everyone's needs. All the important parts including some well invited comic relief is included.This movie is likewise, the third, where it is set in a much serious tone. Plus, it is much dark and for the first time we see Lord Voldemort, the nemesis of Harry Potter. It sets off just like in the books, and Mike Newell very subtly clips some unnecessary portions of the books. Although the hardest of the hardcore fans may complain that the quidditch World Cup could have lingered a bit more, but for your information fellas, the quidditch world cup was cut from the original script, just because it caused a massive uproar, Steve Kloves decided to put it in for a few minutes. Also the maze wasn't quite up to the mark, there wasn't any fanciful/dangerous creatures that Dumbledore (Gambon) warns the champions about.The special effects is state of the art, so is the camera direction. As I stated previously, the acting is way better, particularly because it is a much mature movie, now that all the guys are 16. The music, and score was good, but frankly Harry potter scores aren't the same without John Williams.Overall 9/10, a must see for all Potter fans...",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Another potter classic,"After watching this on its UK opening weekend, I have to say that the special effects team have done one of the best jobs I have ever seen. Its no wonder it took 18 months to tick all the boxes. The film was great although for me didn't get past an eight simply cos of the length of the film. I know to some, this represents value for money, but any film that lasts longer than it takes to fill your bladder is a definite no-no for me on the big screen, simply cos you are going to miss something and whats the point of that. Short of being dehydrated and drinking nothing for the best part of three hours you will need a bathroom break. Will be a superb film just like the others on DVD, this is cos there's a pause button at home if only there was one for the big screen lol! The bit that sticks in my mind, is during the first challenge when harry falls off his wand broom and the dragon claws its way across the castle roof, absolutely stunning graphics and a great all round film. Just don't watch it at 11pm like we did, didn't phone a taxi till 2am, a bit of a killer!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
after reading the book BEFORE watching it.,"Well, I will have my complaints in this, and will have my praises. Let me start by complaining.They did in fact leave a lot out of the plot of people like Crouch, Bagman (who isn't even in the movie, but I suppose could have done without), and the thing that really got me that they missed was the part of Snape being a Death Eater. That was completely crucial to the plot, and it really bummed me out that it wasn't there.Secondly, whatever happened to that scene of Harry sneaking around in the invisibility cloak, and him nearly getting caught by Snape and Crouch, but Moody saves him. That would have been cool to see, but that's just me. So would them finding out that skeeter was an Animagus.Overall, I'm not much of a book fan, and I suppose I just read these things to get a sense of what is going on. I liked it when I read Azkaban AFTER seeing the movie, because that way I could fully enjoy the movie without critiquing it too much. After reading the book and watching it again, then I guess I had a few more complaints, because they kind of messed up with azkaban, even though I thought the movie was brilliant as a MOVIE. If you put every little thing from a book into a movie, then you'll have a 6-7 hour movie, and you will fall asleep by the end. If they had tried to make this one a little bit longer, then they might have been able to do better with it, but I still loved Goblet better than Azkaban.Last complaints. WHERE IN THE BLOODY HELL WAS SIRIUS? HE""S THE MOST IMPORTANT SUPPORTING CHARACTER IN THE ENTIRE BOOK, QUITE LITERALLY. THEY COMPLETELY BUTCHERED THAT! Also WHERE THE HELL DID QUIDITTCH GO, they just used that whole World Cup scene to introduce Krum. there were so many interesting parts of the Quidditch Cup in the book. all we get is a bloody talent show, and then we don't even see a match. The sorry excuse for a match in Azkaban would have been like a Quidditch Globetrotters game compared to the crap Quidditch we got here.OK, now for the good stuff.I liked how they got the main plot of Harry in the Goblet of Fire, and Voldemort returning pretty dead on. The other thing that I liked that Newell did was how the small stuff was paid closer attention to, but in a very subtle way in some areas, and a huge part in others. there were some very interesting things that could have been put into the movie from the book that were very little and insignificant, but would have worked on film. The stuff they did cut out, some of it was worth it, some of it just screams ""why the heck did they leave that out?"" For example, I personally am getting a little tired of the Dursleys in the beginning of every movie now. The cut was bound to happen if you ask me. Harry's dream is much more interesting, plus it took forever in the books to actually get to the Quidditch world cup.The whole save the elves thing in the book could have been done subtly but I wouldn't have been too interested in that. Those elves were annoying if you ask me, and I'm a wee bit thankful for their cut.As for Hagrid's whole giant-allowed-to-teach-at-Hogwarts dilemma, could have been done, but wasn't. Again, another thing that took forever to solve in the book when it wasn't moving along the main plot at all.As for the Tri wizard tournament scenes. Brilliance scenes, especially in the Dragon scenes. The Yule Ball was well done, and it was key to the movie, so I'm glad they got that in there. There was enough of the Indian twins as well as Cho Chang, and I'm glad they stayed true to the books with those subtle details. The Voldemort return was kind of quick at first, but as it went along, it became more interesting to watch. The ending where Harry broke down after Diggory died was major kudos on Radcliffe's's part. The ending with Moody was a good end to all the peril in the movie. I think they could have done more with the Trio at the end, but hey, it's the movies. They always butcher something from a book or game.I guess I'm saying that they can't do every single thing in the books, and they often leave out wonderful parts that would work well on screen. I felt somewhat gypped from the books, but I guess that is my punishment for reading the books first. Cinematically, it's a fantastic film to watch, as for being faithful to the books, the first and second one do it the best, but it gets a little boring if you follow every detail again. I think in order to absolutely defend this movie's future, I can say that I think they cut out some of the subtle things to avoid repeating themselves in the movies as far as goes events that have already happened in a similar way. My two main disappoints are the ones in capital letters, but all in all, it's entertainment, and it's Hollywood, and this is what we get. I know I'm waiting 'till after Phoenix comes out to read that book.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Could have been better,"It would have been better if Dumbledore was played by Max Von Sydow, and if Fleur was played by Heather Burns. They would have done much better in the roles, as they could easily play the part the way it was written in the book. I think Max Von Sydow has the perfect speech, and look to make Dumbledore come alive. Richard Harris had it down pat, but I don't think this guy can play it right. Other than that, it was great...the guy who played Mad Eye Moody was perfect....he really brought the role to life. Also the guy who played Krum did an excellent job. The special effects were very good too.I wish they would have stayed closer to the book, but I guess somethings get sacrificed due to time. I think everyone who loves Harry Potter would sit through a 4-5 hour movie. I hope they bring out extended versions on DVD like Lord of the Rings did. I would happily buy them.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The fire grows dim,"This is the fourth film in the Harry Potter series, and the franchise seems to be running out of steam. Not as fresh as the others, this one seems repetitive in its story line and almost tedious. At a running time of over two and a half hours, it drags at times.The threesome of Harry, Hermione, and Weasley are now in their mid-teens and beginning to show interest in the opposite sex. The story line about Harry facing up to the dark forces that killed his parents is advanced some, though a final resolution is obviously being left for a future film. Some well-done computer imaging almost makes up for the lack of a good plot.The supporting cast is pretty amazing. The best actors in British film play a variety of roles. Ralph Fiennes shows up near the end as the evil one, Lord Voldemort. Miranda Richardson plays a ditzy gossip columnist, Rita Skeeter. Brendan Gleeson is introduced as a crazy one-eyed professor. Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon, Gary Oldman, and Jason Isaacs all return in roles played in previous Potter films.I think the director tried to cram too much into the film, but overall, it's good entertainment. Future films will certainly deal with the confrontation with Voldemort and the question of any love interest between Harry and Hermione, but I hope the next director eases off on the special effects and gets a good scriptwriter instead.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Amazing!!!!!!,"Harry Potter's 4th year at hogwarts is about to begin unbeknown to him this will be his hardest to date with the tri-wizard tournament coming to hogwarts where two schools visit the school and a champion is chosen to compete from each of the three schools by the goblet of fire. All three of the champions must compete in a series of magical contests each as deadly and as demanding as the next.Everything is fine until harry's name comes out of the goblet of fire as the mysterious 4th competitor at the age of 14 when the entry age is 17.Its certain that something is going on as harry competes and has the most eventful and hardest year of his life...This is the best of the series so far without a doubt.I loved all of the others previous to this Harry Potter.But G.O.F is without a doubt the darkest,most exciting,most breathtaking and best directed of them all.I've been keenly anticipating this since the end credits of P.O.A all the acting has been improved the trio have all matured well in their roles as Harry,Hermione & Ron(Rupert Grint- still brilliant as ever) death eaters were genuinely scary.Beauxbatons and Durmstrang entrance to the great hall was excellent although i wish that Hagrid(Robert Coltraine)had a bit more dialog as he is brilliant in all the movies.The yule ball was visually amazing.Duel with Voldemort at the end was excellent.Voldemort who was played by Ralph Fiennes was excellent and Ralph Fiennes sucked everything he could out of the character.Expect only aces in special effects and action in this 4th installment of J.k. Rowling's magnificent series of books.I give this 10/10 absolutely brilliant!!!! Go see this movie this is the best movie of 2005 along with star wars episode III and king Kong.Its true that a lot of material was cut from this book but that will always happen when someone is asked to adapt a 500 or so page book into a movie that keeps you entertained and watching.If everything from the book was put in we would be watching a sixteen hour long movie.I think the books are brilliant but the movies are different from the books its a fact so to all those die hard Potter fans who will nit pick at every detail and say its an awful movie just accept it for what it is an enjoyable,exciting,action packed adaption of a marvellous book. This is my opinion please go and watch it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Good enough movie, but all action, no intrigue","First off, I will say I enjoyed goblet of fire. If I wasn't a fan of the books I'd probably give this and easy 8 or nine as the movie moves along nicely, the plot is fun and entertaining, the special effects are exciting and splendid in a few places, all in all an exciting and enjoyable film.What really disappointed me was that in the process of paring down a nearly 800 page novel into a manageable film the director and screenwriter left us with all plot and no intrigue. No suspense. No mystery. These aspects are what make Harry Potter special, and especially in this book as we are constantly wondering -who is the culprit?This movie never gives us time to stop and wonder, just keeps shoving the plot along, full speed ahead. The movie opens with Harry and Ron asleep in their beds at the Weasly's, groggy and disoriented as Hermione wakes them. They are rushed out of bed to go who knows where to do who knows what. That is exactly how this movie left me feeling. The audience is grabbed by the scruff of the neck and thrust head first through a portkey. While the navel-jerking, head spinning ride through space-time that magic allows can be exhilarating, it leaves one breathless and at a loss for one's surroundings. Not exactly the mark of good film making, in my opinion.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Action without characters,"I just came home from watching this movie, and I have to say I'm disappointed. After seeing the ""The Prizoner of Azkaban"", I was really hopeful about the direction in which the movies were going. Sadly, it's going the wrong way again.The movie feels like chapters being cut from the book and then simply put together. My sister, who hasn't read the books, had a hard time following from time to time, and I don't blame her. The beginning went incredibly fast but without any explanations to things happening. They just happened, and that was that. The rest of the movie followed the same pattern. One action scene is followed by another without a trace of character development.On the plus-side, the actors get better for each movie (with the exception of Radcliff who still needs to learn proper face expressions). The movie also looks incredibly nice.As I said before a whole lot of material is cut from the book. Entire characters are lost. This confuses me as to who the movie is meant for. It can't be people who hasn't read the books, because they can't follow it. Neither do I think it's a movie for the hard-core fans. To much of the stuff the fans love have been taken away. What did you think when you let this pass through Rowling?My reason for my high vote is that the movie is still capturing. I don't regret paying to see it. I'm simply hoping that for the next movie the tempo is cut down, and character development is brought forward. The books deserve that.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Why no John Williams?,"Greatly enjoyed the film but could not at first understand why the quality of the music was so poor. I assumed that John Williams had been suffering from Potter overload, so unimaginative and repetitive was the score, until eventually the credits revealed the explanation, he didn't actually write the music for this episode of the saga, although a Williams theme from previous episodes was used endlessly and, apart from moving it into a minor key, almost without variation. For me, so much of the special impact made by the screen images and action in the first three films was enhanced and intensified by Williams' magical (literally) melodies and scoring, that the lack of those vital elements in the Goblet of Fire were deeply and disappointedly missed. Does anyone know why he didn't work on this latest film?",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
