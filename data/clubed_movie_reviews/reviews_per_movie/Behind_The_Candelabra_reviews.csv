Master Class,"By sheer coincidence, just two nights prior to the debut of 'Behind the Candelabra', I had the pleasure of viewing one of my favorite films, 1965's 'The Loved One', in which Liberace played 'Mr.Starker', a casket salesman. So it was with Liberace's voice, image and mannerisms fresh in my mind that I encountered Michael Douglas' portrayal of the man and boy, did he nail it.The story itself is pretty much by the numbers with the kind of shorthand one expects from a TV movie bio; it's the performances that bring this to a certain level of greatness. Douglas all but disappears into the role, right from the start. It's truly an amazing thing to watch, and considering the subject, a brave and unapologetic performance. Matt Damon is equally impressive and while I have no idea if he does the real Scott Thorson justice, his transformation from an eager and innocent young man to a jaded, coked-up and surgically altered paranoid boy-toy is stark and convincing. Add to these chameleon-like performances an unrecognizable Debbie Reynolds and a truly unnerving Rob Lowe and you have two hours of truly compelling, master-class performances.Highly recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
They have no idea he's gay.,"The big studios passed on this film despite the fact that it is directed by Steven Soderbergh (Ocean's Eleven, Twelve, and Thirteen, Traffic), and would star Matt Damon and Michael Douglas. They thought is would be ""too gay.""Well, thank goodness for HBO, as they jumped in and green-lighted the film, which is in competition for the Palme d'Or at Cannes.All the action took place in the seventies and eighties. Liberace was about 40 years older than his new lover, Scott. Michael Douglas was fantastic as Liberace, and Matt Damon was also brilliant in the role of Scott.Rob Lowe and Dan Ackroyd supplied outstanding support to the story.Just the right amount of music; maybe there could have been a little more. This was a fascinating story about a man who was in love with himself far more than he could have been with Scott or anyone else.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Damon and Douglas are superbly good,"For a film about a gay relationship - I had my doubts when I discovered the two male leads were to be played by straight men, but I couldn't be more convinced by their on-screen personas.The kitch was eye-wateringly OTT, Douglas superbly needy yet controlling and Damon sucked into the whole charade. Rob Lowe's performance had me recoiling with his creepiness/plastic surgery face and it couldn't be farther from his more mainstream performances. For a role that appeared for only a few minutes - it stuck with me long after the film was over.All in all, a very solid biopic film that unfortunately won't be Oscared as its been shown as TV movie in the USA. A great shame - Douglas and Damon deserve nominations - their *chemistry* is totally believable.Final point - either Douglas is a superb pianist or the CGI of his hands on the keyboard is first rate!",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Liberace the Legend is served well,"The film is based on the autobiographical novel of the same name by Scott Thorson (with Alex Thorleifson) adapted for the screen by Richard LaGravenese about the tempestuous 6- year relationship between Liberace and his much younger lover Scott Thorson. This film along with SIDE EFFECTS are purported to be Steven Soderbergh's last films he will direct.The cast is very solid. Matt Damon embodies the role of Scott Thorson well - a young apparently bisexual man who has been tossed from foster home to foster home while he does odd jobs (he is 17 years old) tending to animals. In a gay bar he meets Bob Black (Scott Bakula) who takes Scott to a Liberace concert (his first exposure to the mega-star) and to meet Liberace afterwards. There is tension in the air with Liberace's current paramour and performing partner Billy Leatherwood (Cheyenne Jackson) and we soon discover that Liberace (impeccably played by Michael Douglas) only keeps his 'boys' around for a while before his manager Seymour (Dan Ackroyd) gets rid of them with a check. Liberace and Scott find common ground in being needy people without confidants and soon Scott becomes Liberace's next lover. All goes swimmingly until Liberace sees himself on a TV show and sees how aged he has become. He engages plastic surgeon Dr. Jack Startz (Rob Lowe in a very fine performance) to perform a youthful face lift and at the same time convinces Scott to undergo plastic surgery to make him look more like Liberace! And here begins the downfall: Dr. Startz prescribes pain meds to Scott who becomes addicted and moves into heavier drugs, and his behavior, along with Liberace's need for a 'new face' (Boyd Holbrook), signals the breakup of a 6 year relationship - the best relationship either has ever had.There are excellent cameos by Debbie Reynolds as Liberace's mother, Paul Reiser as Scott's lawyer, and others, but the star of the film is in all ways the flamboyant showman Liberace in some of the most interesting outfits ever created. The on screen relationship between Michael Douglas and Matt Damon is entirely credible and neither of these fine actors has a problem with being sexually physical without seeming to be a parody. There are moments that could have been cut, but as Liberace says, less is more and more is wonderful.Grady Harp",,Anonymous,Music
Finally a film that suits Soderbergh's voyeuristic and clinical style.,"It's starting to look like 2013 is Soderbergh's year. Side Effects and Behind The Candelabra seem to be my favourite of his career so far, though that's only relatively, as I'm not a big fan of him. I do have Out Of Sight on my to see list coming up soon and I do need to give Traffic another watch before I make any final assessment on him. Although Soderbergh is frequently the director, cinematography and editor on his projects, he may be efficient but he's far too clinical, pushing the audience as an observer that it's difficult to feel emotionally involved in his films. I can't get excited for his half-baked premises that most likely haven't been fulfilled to their potential. However, Behind The Candelabra may be the first film I've seen of his that suits his style ideally. His style is still distant and voyeuristic, but in this bizarre world where Liberace adopts his lover for a son and pays for plastic surgery to make him look like himself, it feels more deliberate to keep us at a distance.Instead, the scenes of dramatic conflict, decision and choice are played off for jokes and it's really effective, always earning belly laughs with its brilliant one-liners without feeling like it's silly. Perhaps its nervous laughter but it makes for an entertaining and interesting film. Michael Douglas is terrific as Liberace. I've never seen him take a character on like this. He's nearly up there with Sean Penn's Milk. It feels like it's been a while since Matt Damon has been in films I've wanted to watch and with this and Elysium, I've forgotten how reliable a lead he is. The characters inhabit a flashy world, but its kept on the costumes and sets which are incidental more than anything and the style of the film is kept subtle, besides a great choice of swooping cameras. It does have its flaws with nearly soap opera-esque structure and conflict but my expectations were very low so this is a pleasant surprise. I think I even prefer it to Side Effects.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Music
The enigma is overpowering me,"I would not want to be the person shopping around a serious script in Hollywood about the life of the famous pianist Liberace. It would be the toughest of sells to a culture that would likely feel the material is too dry and the demand too little. A slightly campier script, with luxurious set design and intimate portrayals of characters the public wouldn't likely know about is what I'd like to get my hands on. The story of Liberace is stranger than fiction and dryer, more serious material could've corrupted its overall goals and ambitions.The film with the campier script, luxurious set designs, and intimate portrayals is Steven Soderbergh's Behind the Candelabra, a wonderful, limitless look at the life of Liberace, an enigma in every sense of the word. In addition to playing many sold-out shows, the man had a lovelife like no other at the time, meeting and becoming fast friends with Scott Thorson, an aspiring veterinarian who was quickly made his lover. Thorson seemed to have a genuine understanding of the loneliness and lack of friendship Liberace had and provided him with great talks, great compassion, and great sex.The relationship, however, resulted in drug addiction, intense plastic surgery, lies, mistrust, and ended with a lawsuit. Soderbergh and writer Richard LaGravenese don't hesitate to explore this and make it one of the deepest focuses in the picture. The relationships the men had had the highest of highs and the lowest of lows. The scenes when they are together in a hot tub are human and romantic. The scenes when they are fighting are heartbreaking because you realize that these men haven't just come so far to make their relationship work but losing each other after so long would be detrimental to their self-esteems and egos. They complete each other and that's where the magic is at its strongest.Liberace is played by Michael Douglas in one of the bravest roles of his career. So brave and powerful that it's unfortunate that because of the film's TV movie status it is ineligible for an Academy Award nomination. Douglas is an actor who is never conventional with his role choice. The same man who played a common-man pushed off a cliff of sanity, an executive victim to a consuming, real-life game, and a worried father of a drug-addicted daughter is the same man playing a middle-aged, flamboyant pianist with a love for wonder, music, and men. The diversity in role choice is stunning.Matt Damon appears at his youngest as Liberace's lover Scott, in an equally conflicted, complex performance. Damon fills the shoes of the role beautifully and effectively, giving off much in the way of creative energy and heart as he shows just how stressed and torn Thorson must've been in a relationship with someone who truly loved and understood him but wanted to manipulate him. Supporting performances from Rob Lowe as Liberace's doctor, prescribing medicines to both him and Thorson and Dan Aykroyd as his manager are terrific and often are seen providing strong comic relief.For a TV movie to have the cinematography and atmosphere that Behind the Candelabra does is truly a feature worth nothing. It may not be as excessive as Baz Luhrmann's Great Gatsby - I don't expect anything of the next two years to be on par with that film - but rarely has a TV movie achieved such phenomenally vibrant and luscious standards. The only thing that could make it better is Soderbergh proving he knows how to work with it and he most certainly does.HBO seems to be the go-to network for biographical films about figures that wouldn't likely make appropriate return in the theaters (Behind the Candelabra especially considering the summer movie season has already hit the ground running). David Mamet, just a few months ago, directed the delightful and shockingly unbiased Phil Spector, with actors like Al Pacino and Helen Mirren receiving top-billing. Seeing as a Liberace biopic is directed by none other than Soderbergh, I wouldn't be surprised at seeing a slew of films about eclectic media figures being made and released on HBO in the next few years. Networks that have the drive and willingness to air these kinds of films are a necessity to the success of film.Starring: Michael Douglas, Matt Damon, Rob Lowe, and Dan Aykroyd. Directed by: Steven Soderbergh.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Unexpectedly great performances!,"I decided to watch this film on HBO because I thought it would be a hoot - one of those catastrophic and pretentious productions which are so laughable. Within 20 minutes I realized that the film was rather important. Michael Douglas captures the late Liberace's mannerisms and voice with astonishing ease. He is quite stellar in his performance, and I see him now in a new light. Matt Damon is excellent as Scott, his protégé. The personages involved are deeply complex, even if one is only familiar with the contemporary ""National Enquirer"" reports one realizes their is something one can not quite understand about ""Lee & Scott's"" relationship. Douglas and Damon are brilliant in delving into these characters. They are unrecognizable, at times, from the familiar roles we all know of them. I think the film well worth watching. As a bonus, Matt Damon shows his bum on several occasions, for those who are interested; if not, one cannot help but be interested in the wonderful performances from two of Hollywood's great stars! A courageous undertaking well done indeed!!!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"With all the talents, can't quite live up to expectations","It's 1977. Scott Thorson (Matt Damon) is a young animal trainer for the movies. He meets producer Bob Black (Scott Bakula) in a gay bar who introduces him to Liberace (Michael Douglas). After treating Liberace's dog, he takes Thorson under his wing. Thorson is entranced by the opulence and an offer of a job. The older Liberace takes over the young Thorson's life including changing his face by Dr. Jack Startz (Rob Lowe).This movie has Steven Soderbergh behind the camera and some great acting talents in front of the camera. I know it's a TV movie but with that kind of talent, I was expecting a whole lot more. Maybe I expected too much. The story is a pretty simple one about a naive newcomer falling into a sugar daddy. It's a lot of flash and Liberace provides all the outrageousness that any filmmaker could ever hope for. But the story just doesn't have any surprises. The acting is good. Everybody has a lot of fun playing gay. Matt Damon may be playing innocent a little too much at the beginning. The movie looks fine but there isn't any chance to pump up the excitement. This isn't all that compelling.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A triumph,"This is a first-rate piece of work by Mr Soderbergh and his team (kudos to Ellen Mirojnick's flamboyant costumes and Howard Cummings' outrageous interiors). The otherwise excellent screenplay by Richard LaGravanese loses a little steam around two-thirds of the way through, but recovers to give a genuinely touching conclusion.Nominally this is a biopic. In fact, it uses the biopic format to examine a particular relationship in depth. The narrative focus is on the dynamic between two people rather than the inner turmoil of one. This, as well as the director's good taste, has kept at bay the sprawling pretentiousness and sentimentality which usually infest the genre, regardless of how good the central performances are: films as diverse as LA VIE EN ROSE and MILK have been scuppered in this way. Not so BEHIND THE CANDELABRA, which is an altogether more sophisticated affair.The acting is dazzling. Michael Douglas, in a beautifully-written role, communicates the complexity of a real human being, not just a two-dimensional celebrity. At the same time, he gives full value to Liberace's famous showmanship. A star performance, sure - the subject demands it - but also much, much more.Matt Damon is a revelation. For me, up till now, he has represented the worst kind of dead-behind-the-eyes, don't-dare-express-anything movie acting. The nearest I came to thinking any different was his turn as the scout in the Coen Brothers' remake of TRUE GRIT. In BEHIND THE CANDELABRA he displays a range I never thought he had in him. The character moves from naivety through rage to despair and on to quiet understanding. Really, really terrific.The two leads create a totally believable relationship between their characters, in all its aspects. A triumph.The icing on the cake is the supporting cast, led by Dan Aykroyd and Scott Bakula, and spangled with cameos from Rob Lowe, Debbie Reynolds, Bruce Ramsay, Cheyenne Jackson and Paul Reiser.Here in England we're fortunate to see this film on big screens. As is well known, it was financed by a TV company (HBO) and will not be released theatrically in the USA. That tells a sad story about the American movie industry, from which an independent-minded artist like Mr Soderbergh is wise to walk away.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Liberace's story based on Scott Thorsen's book,"I've seen ""Behind the Candelabra"" from 2013 and ""Behind the Music"" from 1988. Behind the Candelabra was an expensive HBO production starring Michael Douglas, Matt Damon, Rob Lowe, Debbie Reynolds, and Scott Bakula.This particular film goes into more detail about Liberace's private life and his efforts to hide his homosexuality. It seems incredible now, given that he was such a flamboyant showman. Interestingly, this flamboyance can be a trait of the ""twinless twin"" where a twin dies at birth.Elvis Presley and Diego Rivera are two other twinless twins, as were Thorton Wilder and science fiction writer Philip Dick. Each of these artists and also many twinless twins have demonstrated an unusual ability and drive - the twinning motif.Their careers are dominated by a compulsion to bring together different strands of creativity, and render something completely new. By doing this, they are attempting - for a lifetime to seek a more fuller understanding of why they lived while their twin died.The Liberace shown to us by Scott Thorsen is much different from that shown in the 1988 movie, a much more honest look at Liberace's lifestyle and sexuality. It's a much richer script.Here we see a man in his big fur walking around an audience, showing his flashy ring and saying, I worked hard for these rocks! In his private life, he was never alone but lonely and had relationships with several young men. Was he looking for someone to help him feel young, or someone to recreate his younger self? We see with Thorsen and Thorsen's plastic surgery that Liberace wanted a mini-younger me.As far as the performances, they were all excellent with the exception of Michael Douglas. As far as I'm concerned, he just put on a wig. His performance can't compare with Victor Garber's, who had less than great material.Marni Nixon, the great singer who dubbed Deborah Kerr, Natalie Wood, and Audrey Hepburn in films, worked with Liberace and toured with him. She obviously loved him. He comes across as warm and generous, and someone who enjoyed spending lots of money, calling his gifts ""happy happys.""Internally, however, he lived in the wrong time and was obsessive with hiding his identity as a gay man. It's a shame. He had a wonderful talent to entertain, and a vivid imagination he was able to share with his audience with his over-the-top clothing, shows, and his personality.A final note: I visited the Liberace Museum in Los Angeles. Liberace had a set of china made in the mold of the royal family's - and after Liberace's, the mold was broken. That was true of him too. When they made him, they broke the mold.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
a disappointment,"a missed opportunity for a film. the true story is that a 57 year old man takes a 17 year old boy to bed, takes him into his home, well his mansion, no less, introduces him to drugs, bullies him into plastic surgery to make him look like himself, and soderbergh decides to give us this piece of fluffy nonsense! its extraordinary. the material is the stuff of horror and this light hearted puff of hum dee hah is the result. is no one else more outraged by the abuse of a 17 year old boy? has the world truly lost its moral compass to such an extent? the idea that a 42 year matt damon should play scott as a 17 year old and fail to tell the real story is wrong. am i really the only person amazed by this? i give this 4 because the film carries a story and it is well acted, it just isn't the film that it should be.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
"Good, but difficult","I was born in the 50's. The honest truth is I have never liked Liberace. I always, even as a child, found him creepy and smarmy.I understand that as the writer Scott Thorson would paint himself into a somewhat sympathetic light and that is to be expected. Some of the things portrayed would be needed to be taken with a grain of salt. The fact is that Liberace did have plastic surgery on Thorson trying to clone himself.To me that lends credence to everything else.Michael Douglas's portrayal is spot on. Matt Damn is also very good.I could not watch this in one sitting but did it in two. The creep and yuck factor just would not allow me to do it.As a gay man I have known many wealthy gay men who flatter, control, use then toss out younger men. It is very sad. That Liberace in the end did not plan anything for Thorson is sad. He tells him ""he was the love of his life"" but still did nothing.Liberace died with an estate of $115 million dollars with very little family.So that in itself says alot.I feel bad that Thorson has had the troubles in his life that he has had to endure. Turned into a drug addict by the plastic surgeon and living a life ruined. Not even left with a face he can call his own.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Fabulous, darling!","Whether you're into classical music or not, there surely are few people unfamiliar with the name Liberace. Wladziu Valentino Liberace was a child prodigy, who became one of the wealthiest entertainers of his time - flamboyant and controversial.Interestingly enough, despite his flamboyance, audiences never realized Liberace was gay. 'Behind the Candelabra' so effectively depicts the life of this enigmatic entertainer. Michael Douglas is well cast as Liberace (who would have thought Michael Douglas would portray a homosexual?) His lover, Scott Thorson, is portrayed by Matt Damon. With the film being based on a book written by Thorson himself, one can assume the events in the film to be pretty accurate.The film is fast-paced and captivating. It features incredible costumes and the make-up is stunningly well done. I also loved the production design. Oh, the opulence! Although a drama, the film is also quite funny. (It does get a bit depressing towards the end, but then again, this is based on fact and tells the story as it happened).Whether you're interested in the real-life icon or not, 'Behind the Candelabra' makes for an entertaining watch. You don't have to like classical music to enjoy the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"A Thin, Inconsequential Movie","The movie is uninspired. Structurally it's solid but from a story telling point of view it's bland. It's so thin that I spent most of my time wondering how far Douglas and Damon were willing to go on the gay thing. It seemed more like they wanted to simply add 'a gay character' to their CV's - neither of them was particularly convincing, nor interesting. Soderbergh might be more the blame though. He knows how to storyboard and block but he hasn't a clue how to empathize with characters and plot.However, Rob Lowe breaks away from everyone. He gives an inspired performance - it's sinister and funny - but it's too short to save the movie.Don't bother with this one, it's not worth the two hour run time. If you want to see an actor imitate a star watch My Week with Marilyn, close your eyes and listen to Branagh imitate Olivier, it's remarkable. Then go back and watch Douglas stumble around Liberace - just for the laugh.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Michael Douglas And Matt Damon As You Never Thought You'd See Them,"I can't honestly say that I know very much about Liberace. I was a teenager in the 70's - Liberace really wasn't my cup of tea. Still, I know about him. His flashiness, his sexuality, his ability with the piano - and I'm familiar with the ""palimony"" suit launched against him by his much younger lover, Scott Thorson. ""Behind the Candelabra"" is the movie adaptation of Thorson's book about the relationship, so it needs to be viewed with a grain of salt; it's hardly unbiased. But unbiased or not, it is a fascinating look into the glitzy, showy, and sometimes degenerate world inhabited by Liberace and Thorson, who was almost 50 years younger than Liberace when the relationship began.The ""world"" is fabulously portrayed. The costumes and sets seem very authentic, and - with the above note about bias being kept in mind - the basic story of the relationship is believable enough. Liberace and Thorson were together for four years, and in those four years, things got weird. Liberace supposedly promised to adopt Thorson; and Thorson was given a part in Liberace's show. The movie portrays the relationship's breakup (due to Liberace's infidelities) and the final reunion between the two, as Thorson visits Liberace on his deathbed. It all seems very realistic, and provides an almost voyeuristic experience into the relationship between the two.The highlight of the movie, though, has to be the performances offered by Matt Damon (as Thorson) and - especially - Michael Douglas as Liberace. Both were brilliant and totally believable in the parts. These must have been difficult roles. Two guys - both obviously straight - playing these parts in a movie which includes a lot of very passionate scenes between them could have come across as awkward, but credit goes to both of them for the fact that it never seemed awkward. They came across as natural together in what must (at times) have been very uncomfortable roles for them. I gained a new appreciation of the talents of both from this movie.It's very enjoyable and it certainly offers a glimpse into a world that the vast majority of us will never see - and that the vast majority of us probably wouldn't want to see.

HBO Is The Hero Here,"Congrats to HBO for having the guts to produce a script which mainstream studios refused to consider. ""Behind The Candelabra"" gives us a story about Liberace's personal life, from the POV of his one time lover, ""blond Adonis"" Scott Thorson. The plot spans some ten years, from 1977 to Liberace's death in 1987.Aside from his public persona, Liberace (Michael Douglas) comes across as egotistical, daring, self-absorbed, and to some extent old-fashioned in his values and beliefs. Scott Thorson (Matt Damon) comes across as passive, a tad lazy, and lacking in foresight and intellect. The plot's first half presents us with a love story. In the second half, reality sets in. One gets the feeling that though there may have been love between the two, Scott is just one more object for Liberace to collect, which was easy for him given his wealth. That kind of material relationship speaks poorly of both men.This film has a big cast, and some well-known names. Rob Lowe is terrific as a humorously bizarre plastic surgeon. Debbie Reynolds, as Lee's elderly mother, is so good that she is unrecognizable. Nearly all of the actors give fine performances. Michael Douglas especially deserves credit given that Liberace's mannerisms and image are so well known.Lavish custom costumes, detailed and elaborate production design, tons of subtle and not-so-subtle makeup all combine to add enormously to the story's credibility, as does the cinematography. Interior lighting makes Liberace's on-stage performances come alive. Music is, not unexpectedly, what Liberace liked, to some extent stuffy and old-fashioned.I was never a Liberace fan. But he was a much-beloved entertainer and talented pianist, who had a long show business career. That the Hollywood studios turned this script down tells us a great deal about Hollywood. The real hero in this film is not a character so much as it is HBO. Maybe there is hope that quality films can still be made, despite cowardly industry insiders.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Behind the Candelabra,"Steven Soderbergh's tentative final film is a biography of Liberace, with the cast of Michael Douglas (his post-cancer comeback) and Matt Damon, it still fails to secure a cinema release in USA, which comes across as a bummer since after BROKENBACK MOUNTAIN (2005, 10/10) and MILK (2008, 8/10), in the mainstream media, gay films haven't yet progressed much thanks to the conservative top brass in the Hollywood. Anyway, trends will change eventually, nothing can stop it, USA made a great advancement several days ago and the rest of the world will follow.Michael Douglas stuns with his effeminate mimicry (on stage is the lilting rendition) in the film as the world-known pianist, a flamboyant closeted-man, a selfish control-freak obsesses with his complexion and his tabloid news, but he is also a genius player, an apt entertainer, although the taste he denotes is tawdry and grandiose, he is a nouveau-riche would make the rest of the world grudge. Though hobbled by my ignorance of Liberace, Douglas' incarnation is a self- challenging ambition and now an Emmy award is low-hanging fruit for him, and the make-up team too is awesome, both the face-lifting and AIDS-afflicting guises are eyeball-grabbing.Matt Damon is his Adonis baby-boy Scott Thorson, albeit both him and Douglas are two- decades older than their characters in real age, it is a long-delayed meaty role for Matt, in lieu of the film is based on Scott's own version of the story, he hogs an ever longer screen time than Liberace, one might find him in lack of a sense of queerness in his rough-edginess (by comparison, Boyd Holbrock is more accurate in presenting his allure as another young flesh for Liberace), but the choice itself flouts the stereotype, and Damon runs the gamut of emotions from a naive boy falls for an elder man to a meds-addicted fop cannot get over with his philandering significant other, his best performance so far!Two highlights from the supporting group, Rob Lowe, whose face undergoes an extreme elevation, plays deadpan humor at its best as the plastic surgeon; the legendary Debbie Reynolds, also stands out as Liberace's mother whose exotic accent and childish playfulness leave a strong impression from her brief stint in the film.Out of my wayward obstinacy, I put Damon ahead of Douglas regarding the performance, but the film is a well-orchestrated drama, Soderbergh steers clear of any offshoots and centers on the troubled relationship which is tedious but typical in a mundane world. We sneer it on the screen whilst in reality we tread the same water again and again.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Everything I like about a movie,"Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of Steven Soderbergh as I find a lot of his films quite boring. But this film really blew me away.It has everything I want to see in a movie: great performances, true stories, same sex love, a little bit of nudity, but not too much, truthfulness, warmth, minimum amount of violence and good cinematography.I have a newfound respect for Michael Douglas, who becomes completely unrecognizable (with a little help of good make up) , gives it all in his performance as Liberace, and yet only just beat cancer a year earlier.10 out of 10**",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Mother love,"It seems bizarre that many people thought Liberace was camp but did not think he was gay.As a young child when his television specials were shown I was aware that there was something effeminate about him even though I had no idea what homosexuality was. He even would have a female companion in these shows, a wink at the audience that he might be straight.Behind the Candelabra is a film from Steven Soderbergh with Michael Douglas playing the entertainer as a reptilian predator of young men. Preening, vain, bejewelled, promiscuous and yet empty. A bit like the top of his head when he took off his toupee.Matt Damon plays his teenage lover Scott Thorson, who is taken by a friend to see Liberace's Las Vegas show and then backstage is bemused by the attention lavished on him by the older star who showers him with gifts and love and eventually ejects him with little dignity as a newer, younger model enters the scene.Of course the film is based on the book by Thorson whose own veracity has been questioned and whose account might be self serving. It is not helped that although Damon looks buff in the disco infused late 1970s era, at the age of 43 when this film was made, he was frankly too old to be playing the teenage Scott Thorson.Douglas who for a period was a sex symbol with sex thrillers such as Fatal Attraction and Basic Instinct is having a hoot camping it up as Liberace, not afraid to show his vulnerable side. Ultimately the only person he had a real relationship with was his mother played here by Debbie Reynolds.I found the whole drama too shallow and maybe even too safe. After all there is nothing here we have not seen here before. It is just that the gold digger would normally be a young woman who is the plaything of a successful older man.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Great Performances! 7/10,"Review: This is a great movie which is based around the love story between Liberace and Scott Thorson. The acting is superb and very believable, which gives you an insight into the weird and flamboyant world of Liberace. It's hard to to imagine that people actually lived in a world like this but after watching the documentary on the DVD, it does bring the movie more to life. It's based around the book by Scott Thorson, so a lot of the storyline is true, and the events really did happen. I have always been a big fan of biopics, and this one is definitely one that I would recommend because of the great performances and direction. Enjoyable!Round-Up: Whilst watching this movie it's hard to remember that you are watching actors who have played Bourne and Gecko because of how well they play gay men. The movie really brings the best out of Matt Damon and Michael Douglas who deserve an Academy award for there performances. Even Dan Akroyd, who plays Liberace manager, and Rob Lowe are great in the movie, along with Scott Bakula who is famous for Quantum Leap. The film does make you want to find out more about Liberace because of the world that he created from his amazing talent as a pianist.Budget: N/A Worldwide Gross: $2.6millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there biopics which are based around the world of Liberace and his relationship with Scott Thorson. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Majestically Carved! Genuine Depiction! ♦ 82%,"So what if it is a gay movie and was shown on HBO before the theaters? Steven Soderbergh, I salute you for having moxie to show the world what to make films about. Matt Damon is so enchanting as Scott Thorson, I should admit, he is the star and not Michael Douglas, of this lovely movie.You probably know the story but here... the screenplay will amuse you, the music will enthrall your ears, the performances will enrapture your mind, the ideologies will ravish your mindset and the glitterati will dumbfound you to heavens. The intensity of gayness is very strong and that is what makes this a wonderful watch because it doesn't hesitate to decipher. I can't figure out the hate involved with multiplex owners not allowing it to be showcased? Too bad. Or did I hear a rumor?All the shining wardrobes, the lights, the piano melodies... and what- not... there is so much than meets the eye. I truly relished it because it is genuine and full of life. You may even learn a lesson or two. The pleasure of clearly watching the down & fall of characters is rife. 8.2/10.BOTTOM LINE: Shun the negation, go & dissolve yourself into the world of Liberace & Scott & their exploits.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

Mr Showmanship ... and Scott,"Greetings again from the darkness. According to director Steven Soderbergh, this is his farewell to film. He is taking his eye and camera and will concentrate on specialty projects ... at least until he figures out that movie directors make more money (yes, I'm skeptical). This one has been ""in the works"" for years and is based on Scott Thorson's autobiography.If you don't recognize the name Scott Thorson, you surely recognize his opponent in his 1982 palimony suit ... Liberace. The story recounts how a 17 year old Scott fell under the spell of Mr Showmanship, and didn't leave until 1982. To understand what occurred during those years requires an understanding of the times. The gay culture had not worked its way into mainstream America. Despite his over-the-top flamboyance (on and off stage), Liberace's fans refused to believe he was gay ... or more accurately, refused to even entertain the idea.Although their actual ages are way out of whack for the story, Matt Damon and Michael Douglas are both exceptional as Scott and Liberace, respectively. Much of this story focuses on Scott, but Douglas' performance is what makes this work. He walks the fine line between predator and protector, lover and louse. When he tells a young Scott that he wants to be his ""Brother, Father, Lover, Friend"", we are nauseated as viewers, while Scott is captivated.Supporting work comes from Dan Akyroyd as Seymour Heller, Liberace's fixer and handler; an exceptional Rob Lowe as plastic surgeon Dr. Startz; Scott Bakula as one of Scott's first and the one who introduces him to LL; Paul Reiser; Nicky Katt; and Debbie Reynolds ... yes THAT Debbie Reynolds ... who plays Liberace's controlling and creepy mother.Scott Thorson is really not a very interesting character, though there is no doubt that he and Liberace were exceptionally close for almost six years. The movies have shown us many ""kept"" women over the years, so it's a twist to see a studly young man in the role. The slow spiral into drug addiction and paranoia is not fun to watch, and luckily the movie ends with Liberace's passing due to complications from AIDS. Since then, Mr. Thorson testified against gangster Eddie Nash in the Wonderland murders, and was placed in the Federal Witness Protection program. Of course, his taste of fame would not allow him to live a quiet life and he has since been shot and arrested ... even giving interviews from the Reno jail just one month before the premiere of this movie.Definitely worth watching thanks to the Michael Douglas performance, but also as a reminder of just how much innocence society has lost in the last thirty years. Soderbergh says that no studio would distribute the film because it was ""too gay"". Maybe we haven't progressed so much after all. Luckily HBO picked it up, though that prevents Douglas from being an Oscar contender. Brace yourself for the ""creep factor"". Liberace even tried to legally adopt Scott ... a move that eclipses the wildness of even his costumes, pianos and cars.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Yes, gay movie... the best I've seen!","I just watched this movie and I felt immediately compelled to write a review. Michael Douglas carries the movie amazingly well. I have seen him in many movies but after seeing him playing Liberace tonight I have only respect for him. Matt Damon did a good job too but certainly not near as great as the job Douglas did. I am amazed that no studio wanted to do this movie. I liked Brokeback Mountain but I never connected with the gay relationship it portrayed. Here, the relationship feels sincere, much more natural. Douglas never looks like a caricature, a path that could have been easily to go for, He looks like a real person (I never saw Liberace perform). Great job Mr. Douglas, you have won a fan!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Hilarious,"This film is not a statement on gay people or celebrities. I mean lets face it, Liberace was way out there on everything.I laughed all through this. What a cast of characters.

Behind the Candelabra is a fascinating peek into the secret life of a legend,"Liberace: virtuoso pianist, outrageous entertainer and flamboyant star of stage and television. A name synonymous with showmanship, extravagance and candelabras, he was a world-renowned performer with a flair that endeared him to his audiences and created a loyal fan base spanning his 40-year career. Liberace lived lavishly and embraced a lifestyle of excess both on and off stage. In summer 1977, handsome young stranger Scott Thorson walked into his dressing room and, despite their age difference and seemingly different worlds, the two embarked on a secretive five-year love affair. BEHIND THE CANDELABRA takes a behind-the-scenes look at their tempestuous relationship - from their first meeting backstage at the Las Vegas Hilton to their bitter and public break-up.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Ivory Tower,"This uncompromising backstage dramatisation of the turbulent relationship between celebrity pianist Liberace and his much younger lover Scott Thorson was a compelling watch. As I watched it, it took a little time for me to get over the sight of Michael Douglas and Matt Damon, two celebrated uber-masculine action heroes playing such camp characters plus their over-familiarity as stars if anything detracts from identification with their parts here but the fact that both absolutely throw themselves into their roles saw them convince me in the end.Liberace in real-life conducted himself as a family favourite, particularly with his female audience, playing popular piano pieces in cabaret and projecting a debonair if very camp image, on and off-stage, owning the inevitable L.A. mansion, with a grand piano in every room, innumerable fancy cars and of course his elaborate rhinestone-heavy stage costumes. Behind this facade however was a ruthless businessman, determined to preserve his self-image (woe betide the publication which levelled charges of homosexuality at him), in addition a controlling and sexually voracious individual who attended male-only brothels, watched hard-core gay porn and groomed young male wannabes into becoming his latest playmate. Douglas is excellent at portraying his character's at the same time compelling but repellant nature, flaunting his squeaky-clean image in public while living a life of decadent sleaze after hours.Into his orbit comes a young blonde bisexual country boy called Scott Thorson who very soon supersedes Liberace's then live-in boyfriend, attracted by the older man's charm, riches and power until too late he realises that he's being made over in his lover-employer's image and developing a drug addiction in the process.The power struggle between the two is fascinating to watch even if it is of course heavily slanted in Liberace's favour. The question here really is did Liberace corrupt and waste a young innocent's life or was Thorson a willing participant in the gravy train, happy to go along with it from the start.Director Siderburgh I think tends to the former viewpoint, although it's clear that Thorson is no angel himself. On the other hand, Liberace too is no one-dimensional character and it is the older man who calls up the younger as he nears his end from AIDS, fondly remembering their earlier happy times.I like this ambivalence, allowing the viewer to come to their own judgement on this particular lifestyle of the rich and famous. No corner is cut in exhibiting the pianist's excessive lifestyle although I was grateful that the love scenes between the two, although not ignored, was toned down somewhat for easier consumption. The acting is excellent, especially by the two big-name leads while Rob Lowe steals his scenes with a centre- parting like the Red Sea as a creepy plastic surgeon.I'm not surprised this film received so many Emmy plaudits and commend the director and cast for taking on a tricky subject and delivering such compelling viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Could Have Used A Bit More Camp Humour,"Ah a bio-pic on the flamboyant self styled ""Mister Showmanship"" and rabid heterosexual Liberace""Eh hold on Theo . You do realise Liberace was gay don't you""Really ? I do remember British tabloid rag The Daily Mirror in the 1950s implied Liberace was gay . They didn't come out and say it in so many words but merely implied it and this led to them losing a libel case . Likewise an American publication from around the same time did the same thing that resulted in the same outcome and Mr Showmanship cried all the way to the bank to cash those cheques . In other words he was an utter hypocrite who spent much of his life living a massive lie . How'd he get away with it ? I'm reminded of a BBC documentary from many years ago called REPUTATIONS where Bob Monkhouse told of a time where he revisited an ATV studio after a gap of four years and remembered everyone by name and asked how they and their relatives were . He remembered each and everyones name and the names of their relatives . As Monkhouse stated ""There wasn't a single person in the studio who didn't gasp wow what a guy"" . Liberace had that sort of cheesy charm that propelled him to if not superstardom then at least to showman fame . He understood who and what his audience was and made the most of itBEHIND THE CANDELABRA was many years in the making but kept being delayed because director Steven Soderberg couldn't decide how to tell the story . I'm afraid in my opinion it shows to an extent . It's not an affectionate love letter to its subject but at the same time it's not the schlocky campfest that it hints it might become . You want someone playing Liberace then who better to play him than Michael Douglas in what must be the most challenging role of his career . And get him to play the role by wearing a wig that wouldn't look out of place perched on top of Gary Glitter's bald head . Douglas has a whale of time playing the role and while he's not exactly channeling the dead spirit of Liberace it does capture the opulent over the top camp nature of Mister Showmanship and one did hope at this point the film would just throw its hand in and have the rest of the film continue in the same way . Unfortunately the story uses Scott Thorson's book as its source material and when Damon - equally cast against type - the film has a rather serious tone that's maybe a bit too respectful . It's a tragic story but one might have hoped for a bit more tragic-comedy",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A bio-pic that is worth seeing and I thought was good but the performance by Douglas was great. Watch for him. I say B,"""I want to be everything to you Scott. I want to be father, brother, lover, best friend."" This is the true story of Scott Thorson (Damon) and his relationship with the one and only Liberace (Douglas). Scott was a normal easy going gay man with a dream to become a vet. That all changed when he met Liberace. The small town boy became a drug addicted, paranoid, and revenge obsessed man. I wasn't totally sure what to expect from this movie. I knew very little about the real Liberace and nothing about this story at all. The movie shows the rise and fall Scott and the extreme things he goes through for the man he loves. The story is pretty interesting but the real reason to watch is the performance of Michael Douglas. He is great in this and turns himself completely into the character that he makes you forget you are watching a famous actor like Michael Douglas. Overall, a pretty interesting bio-pic that I thought was pretty good but the performance by Douglas is great. I give it a B.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Not a movie that everyone will be able to handle.,"Liberace was way before my time, and even if I've heard the name before, I knew nothing about him, not even that he was a piano player. Definitely not that he was on of the first mega pop stars, before the term pop star was even invented. Nor that he was as gay as you can be and that he managed to hide this from the public through out his life.Micheal Douglas does a performance here that is none other the Oscar worthy. Portraying Liberace as a man more gay than gayness itself, a flaming queen. And a man completely in love with himself. Obsessed over material excess. And addicted to be having sex with young men.The film is about the relationship between Liberace and one of these young men, named Scott Thorson (Matt Damon). Scott Thorson, the very man that later wrote the book this film is based upon. Was perhaps the one Liberace was closest to, of all his lovers. They're were practically a married couple without being married. And their relationship was a secret to the public.There are no real sex scenes in this movie but heavily implied. This movie is not for someone who can't handle a bit of ""gay stuff"" because it's absolutely everywhere. Some would probably even see it as a horrifying freak show. Even gay men will cringe I would assume, since it's sex between a much older man with a much younger one, which can be both morally and tastefully questionable. And the relationship is also besides that, in many other ways, all other then normal. Actually, this movie is above everything else, a story about people living extraordinarily different lives, from the normal.It's very hard to believe that Liberace was able to pass as straight to the public, back then. Because, it's hard to be more gay then he was, I even watched some real clips of him after seeing this movie. But in those days, people were much more unaware, I have to assume. His career would have been over if it got out, so he had to hide it. He even wrote a autobiography were he changed the male names of all his lovers to female ones.It's a fascinating story, and really funny too, or at least this movie is very funny. But not really a comedy, it just is funny. While the story is actually very real and shockingly intimate to these peoples life. And it's definitely not only about a gay people being gay. It's a bit of a character study on both Liberace and Scott Thorson.Liberace was a narcissist and extremely superficially minded. A person who can't get enough out of life and with the position to get all he wants. But to me, it also seemed like he was a loving man, even if he was more in love with himself than anyone or anything else, he still cared for people, he was never out to hurt anyone, he just wanted all the fun out of life for himself. He worshiped himself. That's at least how he is portrayed here, a person full of life, a person that enjoys life, while at the same time being an complete superficial narcissist. Scott Thorson is a much more sadder character, that has no real talant and rely solely on his looks, a person that's probably very empty inside.If you have the stomach for it, this is a very good movie. And Douglas performance is just fantastic. Very brave performance also, it has to be mentioned, from both Douglas and Damon. To be honest, I found this movie hilarious, but I don't even know if it was meant to be that. It's actually a kind of dramatic story but I was laughing myself to tears instead. On top of that, it's both a fascinating and interesting true life story. And a very intimat view into these people strange life. But you should know what you're getting into before watching it. It's very gay.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Bourne with gender identities,"It's hard to imagine super-spy Jason Bourne in a sparkly thong, throwing a hissy-fit at his older male lover. Perhaps that's why Matt Damon's performance has got him quite a lot of praise for his portrayal of the young man (Scott Thorson) who lived (and loved) Hollywood icon Liberace. Michael Douglas too is on fine form as the man himself, displaying the voice and the mannerisms of the flamboyant entertainer to a tee.It's a 'rise and fall' tale of love that was probably doomed from the start. It's based on the 'kiss and tell' book that Thorson wrote once Liberace had died, so we only have his word on it that this is the 'truth.' But, truth or not, it's an entertaining piece of tragic drama that allows both him and Douglas to put in some stellar performances.It probably isn't for everyone. If you look at internet message boards, you'll see a fair few people who found it 'overly gay' in subject matter. However, if that sort of thing offends you, you really shouldn't even be considering watching a semi-biopic about a gay couple's life.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Hiding in plain sight,"The persecution of gay people in the 20th century had some strange side-effects. Take the career of Liberace, the celebrity pianist, who styled himself according to the most outre social conventions of the gay community, but sued anyone who mentioned his sexuality. Liberace also had a series of semi-contractual relationships with much younger men, which one can see as the sort of thing a certain type of rich person might chose to do, but which surely seemed more natural in a world where a more orthodox relationship was socially prohibited. Steven Sodebergh's film shows us scenes from Liberace's life, but also portrays a very odd person and it doesn't really manage to make us feel sympathetic at a personal level, however much one acknowleges the potentially hostile world he had to navigate. Perhaps a full biopic, showing how he became the man we see in this movie, would have been more revealing.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Driven actors, glittery characters, and a slice of very weird Las Vegas life","Behind the Candelabra (2013)Well, there's the story of Liberace, which is astonishing in its own way. Then here is Michael Douglas being Liberace in a true bravado performance.So first things first—see this. It's just a hoot, and a well done biopic. Throw in Matt Damon's first rate performance, and some other secondary believable parts, and you realize there is some serious discipline involved. Most of all it is Douglas who manages to not overplay the part of a man who overplayed his public life to an outlandish extreme.If you don't know who Liberace is, you'll find out, but it helps to have a clue (and I have some memories of people liking him, and run across old records of his at junk shops all the time). He was a kind of piano force who decided not to be a serious concertizer but to simply entertain. He wanted to make people happy, and that pretty much sums up his life.Liberace also seemed to lack some kind of long term empathy that would see the damage he might cause young men who got sucked into his influence—and bedroom. It really didn't quite matter, and in his superficial way you can see why. It was a trade off of one kind of oversized entertainer for a more compassionate and giving person—or something like that. It's hard to sum up here but in fact, the big point somewhere, is people of all stripes were playing immediate pleasures against deeper commitment.There is ultimately something thin here as a movie, and it only filled in a bit by watching some Youtube filler on my own afterwards. You might do the same. Comparing fact and representation is pretty amazing.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Not for str8 people,"This movie could be interesting only to two types of people: gay men and fans of Matt Damon and Michael Douglas. Despite the fact that Liberace had an extraordinary life, it seems that it still is not extraordinary enough to be filmed. Steven Soderbergh didn't think so for sure. However, I had reasonable amount of fun during the movie thanks to a couple of gay jokes, and because I could compare my experience and lives of my gay friends with a few moments in the movie. But if I were straight, I probably would stop watching it after 20 minutes. The whole plot is about an old and very successful gay man from showbiz who rents a company of young and not so smart guy who is keen for wealth and luxuries. They had a six-years long relationship followed by problems which are quite ordinary for any gay couple (at some points for straight couples as well). Everything is presented superficial, and the director certainly has failed in intention to show deeper emotions and complexity which that kind of relationship just had to posses. Normally, I would rank this sort of movie with four or five stars, but because of magnificent performance of the two leading actors - Matt Damon and Michael Douglas - I rated it with six stars. Their acting was so superb that I, after only a few first minutes, completely forgot who they actually are, and I continued to watch them as truly gay people who might be a real couple. This aspect of the movie is the only thing that is worth watching.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Another mediocre biopic,"A true story doesn't always equal success and this umpteenth biopic that is Behind The Candelabra proves it once again.If you put aside the extravagant aspect of Liberace and the huge age difference between him and Scott who was only 17 (!) when they met — an important detail that almost goes unnoticed —, what remains is an almost banal love story, with its ups and downs, struggling to convince. The viewer ends up enduring laborious scenes, sometimes very linear, often little constructive, and of more than debatable interest.One could also question the veracity and partiality of the story given that the script is based on the memoirs of Scott Thorson.Anyway, Steven Soderbergh can be thankful to the cast in general and Michael Douglas in particular for their very good performances, because if it wasn't for them, the movie would be a flop.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
"Like watching a rhinestone encrusted episode of ""Jerry Springer"" - I just could not look away!","A film accounting for some of the real-life events which Scott Thorson encountered while courting glitter encrusted pianist Liberace. While directed by Steven Soderbergh, it was adapted for screen by Richard LaGravenese, based on a book written by the aforementioned Scott Thorson, and Alex Thorleifson. Thorson's account spans a period of 6 years, from meeting Liberace, to the pianist's death. Matt Damon plays Thorson and the film also stars Scott Bakula as Thorson's friend Bob Black, Dan Aykroyd as agent/lawyer Seymour Heller, an almost unrecognisable Rob Lowe as the special doctor, and Michael Douglas as Liberace.This film took me by surprise. It was on a terrestrial channel one night and I did not have anything else I was planning to watch. I became fascinated and then it hooked me - I felt compelled to watch it and see it through to find out how things ended. Things happened in the film that I just could not believe, and then morbid fascination really kicked in; the way lovers were introduced and the old ones were basically thrown out with a cheque; the extreme plastic surgery that Scott agrees to; the depths of addiction that both seem to have, albeit in different forms (Scott, eventually with drugs, and Liberace, addicted to himself more than he could be with anything else). The cast in this do a stellar job - when the credits appeared, I chuckled about Douglas being in the film - surely, he could not be Liberace. After 10mins of seeing him I metaphorically ate my own hat. Douglas was brilliant. From his mannerisms to the changes that take place in the film, and his eventual portrayal of the ill and dying entertainer. As far away as anything I have previously seen Douglas in, credit to him for this. Damon too does a fantastic job, he gives depth to Scott who suffers early on from moving from foster home to foster home, and then later begrudgingly goes through with everything that Liberace puts in front of him. Damon does quiet and impressionable well early on, and then does great with his drug addled anger and confusion later. I thought that there might be more music in the film, knowing what Liberace is famed for, but there wasn't an excessive amount - enough to cement the story, but not enough to suggest that film is a musical rather than a semi-autobiographical account. I have to say semi-autobiographical, I know that Scott Thorson is a subject matter in the film, and he wrote the book for which the screenplay is based on, but it's a one-sided account of events, it can't fully be corroborated by all parties. With so much written about the performer, by people he'd met and the media, it really is difficult to know what is true, and what is a construct of the enigma.I enjoyed this film a lot more than I thought I would. I do not think it would have been the kind of film I would have normally planned to watch, but having bumped into it, I am glad I did. I found it to be fun but also morbidly fascinated - it was like watching a rhinestone encrusted episode of ""Jerry Springer"" - I just could not look away, no matter how bad things got. This may not be for everyone, and it possibly is not all based on facts, nor might it tell a full and accurate story - but as a vehicle for entertainment, I enjoyed the film. This is not something I would recommend watching with family, it's absolutely not for younger audiences due to the graphic nature - drugs, sex, language etc. All in all, though, I am happy to give this a 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Well acted but sordid,"There is no doubt that this was well-acted and directed. Michael Douglas and Matt Damon produced brilliant performances that are believable. The problem for me was sitting through a film about two unlike-able characters. I looked at my watch a few times as the hollowness of Liberace and the idiocy of Scott Thorsen gradually unfolded. Meanwhile in the background the manager and the plastic surgeon exploited them. In end I was glad it was all over. The film may well have been accurate, but it was unbearably sordid. My rating is based on how much I enjoyed rather than the technical excellence of the production. (Why doesn't Michael Douglas feature in the cast list on this site?)",6.0,Anonymous,Music
wow...worth watching for Douglas,"Michael Douglas deserves credit for his part in this rather bizarre supposed documentary. Other than passing factoids and news blurbs, I am not familiar with Liberace, other than the obvious media stories and a few appearances he had on Johnny Carson back in the day.Liberace's sometime friend, Scott Thorson, while in real life is apparently a sordid character (We ARE in Hollywood, no one gets a free lunch). Anyway while Damon can be annoying in 'wholesome' type characters, he does okay here. Although I believe that for real facts one may want to research more.At any rate the lifestyle of Liberace is explored, the sumptuous, over the top decor, the dogs, the hangers on, the users, the creepy plastic surgeon (well played by a nearly unrecognizable Rob Lowe).Michael Douglas and his visual effects are quite stunning: the make up here is on the mark. It is something you may find yourself re-watching in disbelief. His effeminate characteristics are also similar to Liberace, the relationship with his mother, and how he actually was relieved once she passed away.Douglas really does seem to be the bilious, blatant and attention seeking persona of Liberace, quite a contrast in performance to Wall street raider Gordon Gecko. Here Douglas transforms into a caricature, believable, humorous, or creepy at times.The pastiche here probably doesn't follow reality, and clearly Liberace had many unsavory experiences, and so the tales we hear now may not all be true. The film makes Thorson a sympathetic jilted boy toy, but perhaps the real story is quite different. He certainly overcame the relationship quick enough to sue the Estate of Liberace for six figures.Audiences not interested in this subject matte may be surprised, and Douglas' performance alone is well worth watching. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Glitzy, but drab","Let's get the good bits out there first. I thought Matt Damon and Michael Douglas were both very good in their roles, Douglas especially going against type. That was impressive. It was well filmed, and the sets were every bit as striking as you'd expect given the subject matter.But despite all the glitz of what I was looking at, the overall was rather drab and workaday. At first I was thinking that was perhaps a reflection on the fact that the rich and famous also live fundamentally normal lives, the same stories played out in terms of relationships and human weaknesses, so the mundane nature of their experience can't really be hidden by the shiny baubles and jewellery, but in the end I feel that there was something else missing from this.A bit like Liberace himself perhaps, this is a film that depends more on style than substance. 'It looks fabulous, so maybe no-one will notice how thin and meagre the rest of the work is' appears to be the underlying ethos for the film, and that's disappointing given the personnel involved.I can't quite get my head round why that is. It could be that the source material is not the full picture given how one sided the account really is (I only found that out after seeing it and that struck me as a possible issue straight away.) Perhaps the fact that it was supported by HBO rather than a more experienced film studio gives it a more televisual, functional feel than might have been achieved elsewhere, but I don't really know why that should be the case, other than the fact that I don't watch any TV any more, partly because it leaves me feeling like what I watch lacks something vital, similar to the way this film makes me feel.I was looking forward to the film, and am glad I've seen it now, but it didn't live up to my expectations.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Why BTC Excels,"Its not very clear from the huge advertisements circling the world around us and the internet, but Behind the Candelabra is a very graphic film. The director, Steven Soderbergh, is very ignorant to the traditional men of values and pushes the intimacy and the unravels the unknown mystery of who is Liberace.Matt Damon is an orphan, abandoned by an untrustworthy mother, who never feels at home with his foster home despite his appreciation for what they have done for him. He finds solace with the great piano player Liberace and they start a gay love affair.One may try to relate this film to another successful homosexual hit Brokeback Mountain, but the very message of hidden secrets, fame and possessions all spin off into a completely new horizon. Though one must not compare these two movies as they are rarely alike.Matt Damon brings across an excellent portrayal of a bisexual behind-the-scenes aficionado for Liberace who in return acts as a father to him. Despite the intense love affair, there is clearly a sort of sixth-sense father-son bond binding these two together.Some scenes triumphed for emotional intensity but this isn't a film about love between two gay men. This is a movie about two men who use each other to fill a void left in them from temporarily places in their histories.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A great movie of a Fifties icon!,"Douglas must at least be nominated for an Academy award for this one because he, at least to Diane and I, slipped seamlessly into his character as Liberace, the masterful entertainer that filled the TV screens during those early days of TV in the Fifties. Hollywood really got it right when they decided to take the book written by Daemon's character and converted his insights into the life of this great entertainer into what became this masterful look into Liberace's life. Thorson, the author as well as the second character in the movie, wrote what seems to be a very fair portrait of himself and Liberace, warts and all.I remember listening to Liberace's TV shows as a kid during the Fifties and not really caring for much of anything about him: his demeanor, his dress nor his music. He did not need me in his audience though; obviously the blue rinse set were his fans and he was exceptionally good at giving them what they wanted, glitz and talented piano playing.Isn't it interesting that certain very talented people appear on the scene at critical times and had it happened later or earlier that talent would have gone unrecognized?

Depressing but well done,"This movie about Liberace's relationship with Thorson is wonderfully acted by Douglas and Damon, effectively filmed, well written, and, for me, not especially enjoyable. I found Damon's powerlessness in the relationship depressing, and while Douglas makes Liberace seem pretty likable, his actions are insufferably egocentric and inconsiderate. Since the book this was based on was written by a jilted lover, it may or may not reflect much truth, but it's still a depressing story.It's hard to know how real any of this is. The plastic surgeon is so disturbing looking that it's hard to believe anyone would go under his knife (the single image I could find of him through google did not look nearly as freakish) and even though Douglas does a great job of nuancing Liberace into a real person in spite of his quirky voice and mannerisms, parts of the movie seem rather cartoonish.It's nice we've reached a point where major Hollywood actors will take a chance on material like this; it's a movie that doesn't shy away from sex the way earlier movies about gay people did. But I just never could get into it.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
incredible performances by Damon and Douglas,"I had no idea about this film before seeing it, although of course I had heard of Liberace and knew a little about his life/death. I cannot believe that people didn't know he was gay. This film, you find out, is the autobiography of Scott Thorson, Liberace's lover and it seems, the love of his life, who was played by Matt Damon. I think that everything Damon does is totally incredible and one of the best actors out there and he played the role convincingly, dedicatedly and with great courage. It was an exposing and difficult role, as was Michael Douglas' and both of them were superb. Douglas seemed to inhabit Liberace and gave the role 100%. Support actors Rob Lowe, Dan Aykroyd, Scott Bakula, and Debbie Reynolds were all superb. I barely recognised Aykroyd and Rob Lowe as the Plastic Surgeon looked ridiculous but was committed with all the facial taping and prostheses he must have been wearing, Matt Damon too post surgery. I don't know how Michael Douglas' facial effects were done but they were amazing. Damon's prosthetics were a little more obvious but still amazingly convincing. The costumes and sets were something spectacular but then there was a lot to work with given the eccentric flamboyance of Liberace himself.The film covers some intimacies of Liberace and Thorson's life but it was remarkably discrete with regards to the sexuality of the two, and I was impressed by that. There is some bad language and sexual reference that is quite gratuitous and drug use but it could have been a lot more overt. Damon and Douglas clearly were very professional and worked well together to be so discrete, covering their mouths for kisses (ie showing the passion and sexuality of a kiss but without the actors presumably having to do it, and the censor-certification for TV only release in the US) and decent camera angles etc.There was much to enjoy in the film, some comedy and happy moments seeing the burgeoning relationship and love between the two main characters, but also a lot of emotional scenes, sadness and feelings of sympathy seeing Thorson's descent into drug problems and their relationship failing. I felt for the characters such was the investment created by the superior acting. It is an exposé film, eye-opening and as a biopic it is a grand and rather ostentatious success.Bottom line, Damon and Douglas were superb and carried a film with rather difficult subject matter that I wouldn't recommend to everyone.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
More interested in what went on under the sheets than on them,"Behind the Candelabra accounts the final ten years of Liberace's life, as seen through the eyes of a disgruntled ex-lover. It's a borderline caricatured, well-acted and quite funny movie in which a superb Michael Douglas conjures up the old virtuoso in all his glory. Director Steven Soderbergh is more interested in what went on under the sheets than on them, but I guess that's just a sign of our sensationalistic times. The film will be meaningful and enjoyable for anyone who isn't inclined to feel that it has an agenda. With an incredibly young-looking Matt Damon as the lover Scott Thorson (whose book the film is based upon) and a hilarious Rob Lowe as the couple's joint plastic surgeon.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Unflinching Showcase,"Liberace relentlessly tried to hide his Homosexuality, its hard to imagine, that even then, anyone with an ounce of Cultural perception could be unaware of Liberace's Sexual Preference.So the enjoyment of this Bio will be a tough swallow for most Straights. The Movie is an unflinching showcase for the lifestyle with all its clichéd customs. The two Lead Performances are bright and never border on parody and it is this and the lavish Production Style that makes this a package of glitz and gloss, Kitch and kookiness dreamy to watch, but may be uncomfortable and difficult to bare.The Director whose best work is done when he puts out a little instead of being matter of fact and calm, does a good job by letting the Performances, Costumes, and outrageousness of the Subject Matter take things to a level of Showbizz Stage primping, and then adds as much loving and concern out of the Bedroom as in.There is also a great Supporting Cast and overall this is a slick, but sometimes sticky Show that is watchable in a tabloid kind of way, but there is really nothing here that Modern Audiences will find insightful.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
GREAT movie!,"I really enjoyed this movie. I thought the storyline was wonderful and the actors, did a great job! There was never a boring moment in the entire film. It rolled along at a perfect clip! I highly recommend watching this! I have always liked Liberace, but watching this movie, made me like him even more. He seemed REALLY down to earth ~ like a nice guy! I loved the outfits he wore. I've always loved sequins. This is a fabulous movie.This was not a super long movie.

"Solid, interesting, but unspectacular","An HBO-originated made for TV movie that received a deserved cinema release, this Steven Soderbergh directed film tells the story of Liberace's long affair with the much younger Scott Thorson, right up to and beyond the eventual death of the pianist. Even viewed on TV, as I did, it doesn't come off like a TV movie; Steven Sodebergh's efficient and composed direction marks this out as worth attention.However it doesn't really go to the depths worthy of the film's outstanding central performances (Michael Douglas as Liberace, Matt Damon as the lover). Liberace is pretty much as you expect the celebrity to be in this sort of story - initially attractive and engaging, then increasingly unpredictable and selfish. Scott Thorson is also as you expect the lover to be: star-struck, naive, enjoying the material benefits of his affair and eventually bitter, angry but still harbouring tender feelings. The narrative never feels quite engaging enough to grip or move; it's more of a genre piece, really - of rich prince and commoner lover lifted above his station. I was never really moved by it - fascinated, maybe; informed, potentially. However without a real interest in Liberace as an individual or artist, it didn't move above average.To say it's not a TV movie isn't a value judgement; it's a substance statement, describing the nature of the beast we're watching. What we're watching is a decent, but unspectacular glimpse into the faded glories of the over-privileged and under-loved.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A very good biopic,"Terrific.First and foremost, I have to admit I knew nothing about Liberace - other than his name - before viewing this, therefore I don't know how much of it is accurate, made-up, exaggerated etc. That didn't stop me enjoying it, though.Michael Douglas (Liberace) and Matt Damon (Scott) do do a lot of the heavy lifting, both of them give tremendous performances - especially Douglas. They actually worked very well together, perfect casting. I found Rob Lowe amusing in this, not sure if I was supposed to but I did - not in a negative way in regards to Lowe, just the character of Dr. Jack Startz. Debbie Reynolds (Frances) and Dan Aykroyd (Seymour) also appear, two well-known people playing relatively small roles.The film looks great, it perhaps lasts a little too long when all is said and done but it didn't hamper my enjoyment all that much. 'Behind the Candelabra' is a very good biopic.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"I liked it,",Purportedly true story of the stormy 6 year relationship between Liberace (Michael Douglas ) and his much younger lover Scott Thorson (Matt Damon). OK--Douglas looks nothing like Liberace but sounds just like him and got the mannerisms down pat. Damon is far too old to be playing Thorson--Damon is in his 40s and looks it--Thorson was about 20 when he met Liberace. But if u can ignore those leaps of logic u might like this.Personally I don't like Liberace. It's not because he's gay (I am too) but he was WAY too flamboyant and ugly. He was a talented pianist though. Still I found the movie interesting. It shows a realistic gay relationship and doesn't shy back from sex and nudity. Also Douglas was great in the role. I've never thought Damon was a good actor and this movie doesn't change my mind. Still he has his moments and u gotta give him credit for wearing some VERY revealing outfits throughout the movie and doing a few nude scenes (back view only). Also in the movie very briefly are Rob Lowe (as a doctor) and Dan Aykroyd (as Liberace's lawyer) but they hardly matter. Scott Bakula and Debbie Reynolds pop up too both looking unrecognizable as a friend of Thorson's and Liberace's mother.,8.0,Anonymous,Music
Over-hyped,"I wish as a culture we had matured to being over homophobia so that the mere choice to play a gay man wasn't seen as ""brave"" or ""out of comfort zone"" or remarkable but just as another role. Then we could judge this movie and the acting jobs on their merits, and not through the lens of either homophobia or defensiveness.I wish, too, that the filmmakers had put more thought into the nature of hangers-on to celebrities, to the why of that beyond a facile pop psychology explanation, and to the benefits to each party of such arrangements. (Though perhaps this would make them look too closely at their own marriages and friendships and failures, so maybe that's too much for me to wish.) Without more than a surface examination of those issues, what we get here is a pretty faithful version of the jilted boy toy's story (based on his rather whiny book of maybe truth and maybe lies), and so a frustratingly shallow presentation of this one story and the phenomenon of hangers on, groupies, and entourages of our de facto royalty here in the U.S: show biz people.What's quite good here is production design, props, costume and make-up and the choice to introduce Liberace in a high-energy performance. (He really could play the piano, but the awfulness of his costumes and staging made him hard to watch and take seriously.) The supporting performances of Lowe as the creepy groupie-doctor-dealer to the stars and Reynolds as Lee's mom were both terrific, and Reynolds (speaking of plastic surgery) being willing to look that old and dowdy was likely as brave a choice as the hip grinding between the two leads. I honestly finished the film thinking ""huh, I thought Debbie Reynolds was in this"" and then it dawned on me who she had played. This always seems a sign to me of good acting, when the actor disappears into the role.Overall, I was disappointed at this slight effort and expected more because of the hype and awards. I'm glad I got it from my library rather than paying a dollar to rent it.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
creepy casting adds to underground atmosphere,"Such tacky taste in the decor is enormously entertaining and kitschy. Douglas and Matt ""Demon"" are sincere and believable. Yes, this would have brought Douglas into Oscar territory had it been a theatrical feature. The constant catty conflicts and jealousies of all characters make for a campy excursion and sordid exploration of a strange seventies world. I understand Zsa Zsa Gabor was contractually ordered to stay in her bedroom and never come out during shooting at her house. That's classic campy weirdness right there. Sort of like how they shot Cuckoo's Nest in an actual working mental hospital. (Douglas produced that, too, another connection.)I loved the underground atmosphere with the seamy, seedy casting of Lowe and of course, Ackroyd (Belushi's pal, wink wink).Wait. I can't blink.",,Anonymous,Music
Behind The Candelabra is as flamboyant as Liberace's glossy wardrobe.,"The final film before Soderbergh's retirement...oh wait, he's still making more films? Retirement spent well! Hollywood initially rejected this due to the content ""being too gay for mainstream audiences"" and so Soderbergh released this to TV stations instead. I for one am glad he went ahead and completed the project. Depicting the lavish lifestyle of Liberace, he recruits a younger fellow named Scott and illustrates the idolising yet spiky relationship between the two of them. If you didn't know who Liberace was, well where have you been hiding? Arguably the most famous entertainer of the late 70's having sold out a multitude of shows with his extraordinary piano playing skills. This biopic depicts the last ten years of his life and the illusory world of fame. Soderbergh consistently focused on both the physically and emotional relationship between these two men and how it rapidly deteriorates from boredom. Liberace wanted to see multiple younger guys and Scott succumbed to drug abuse, thus conveying the exertion of energy that was required to maintain this relationship. There's also themes of vanity, pride and jealousy throughout which come together to create a balanced perspective into Liberace's life. Douglas gives probably his best performance of his career as the central character. He absolutely nailed the campy mannerisms of Liberace and remained fearless during the more sexual scenes. Damon also gives a terrific performance as a young man falling for his idol and willing to do anything for him. It came across as helpless rather than obsessive which indicates the strength of his love for him. My major issue is with the tone. The flamboyancy of this production detracts from the emotional involvement of these characters. I felt disconnected and didn't really feel much during the more emotionally powerful scenes. The glossy veil was just too thick which prevented me from looking through it. Also the runtime felt abit extensive at two hours. However, it's certainly a gay ol' time.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

One of Soderbergh's best films.,"Supposedly no studio wanted to touch this because it was ""too gay"" (an aspect of film trivia that will probably be looked back upon 50 years from now with incredulity), but, like Brokeback Mountain, this is not a ""Gay Movie"" (if there even is such a thing). This is a tragic romance with two superb performances, stellar direction and a great script.I am not always Matt Damon's biggest fan, I think he's quite hit or miss, but when he hits he often hits it out of the park, and that's what he does here. Whether playing a young man surprisingly well or playing the drug-addled version of the same man years later, this is one of his most honest, believable performances.Michael Douglas is phenomenal as Liberace. Watch this movie, then go on YouTube and look up Liberace interviews. If you close your eyes you'll be hard-pressed to find any differences in the cadence of his voice. If this film had been released theatrically he would have almost definitely won an Oscar nomination.I'm not always Soderbergh's biggest fan either, but lately he's been impressing me, as he's moved further away from the mainstream stuff that distracted him for a few years. He directs this film with pure class, and the ending is perfect.This is one of the better films I've seen in years.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Reasonable film spun out of not much,"My wife, who finds homosexuality repulsive, insisted on seeing this film, probably as a result of childhood memories of seeing Liberace on the TV. I knew very little about him, my impression was a kind of Benny Hill without the laughs, not that I am a fan of Benny Hill.The cinema was quite full, entirely of hetero couples like ourselves old enough to remember Liberace, or at least his name. I don't think anyone walked out, though my wife says she nearly did in the early part.I must commend the scriptwriter for drawing a coherent and mostly engaging script out of lives that were lived from moment to moment with little or no regard to thematic content. Like many successful artists, Liberace seems to have lived mainly for his art, if you will pardon the expression, and the pleasures that money can buy. This is not promising material, and if it were not for the Scott Thorson story element the film could not have been made. As it is, much use is made of anecdotal events to pad out the rather thin drama.Michael Douglas does give depth to a character who appeared two dimensional in the filmed performances I have seen, it deserves an award of some kind, and he can be proud of it. Matt Damon is impressive as Scott Thorson, a young man utterly swept away in a tide of glitz, away from the life he had hoped for as a veterinarian. These two actors do manage to let us care what happens to their characters, when it would have been so easy to fall into cliché.The direction is good, unostentatious craftsmanship, the atmosphere becomes increasingly claustrophobic as the tensions rise, and the wonky plot lines are neatly traversed. To me the end feels tacked on, but I don't think they had much option. As the film drew on I began to thirst for a female face, and towards the end when some girl dancers appeared, out of focus, behind Liberace, I drank them in like a camel in the desert. The constant close-ups of men you wouldn't buy a used car from gets a bit wearing, but this, I presume, is what Mr Soderbergh intended. The net impression is of lives and talents squandered. The audiences are next to invisible, and only now and then audible. Liberace was, maybe, his own audience.Not a film I would have chosen to see, but not time entirely wasted.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
The Years With Lee,"With same sex marriage now becoming a reality in many areas it's a good thing to examine some of the relationships that were and still are considered the norm in the gay world. Such a relationship involved Liberace and Scott Thorson played with extraordinary verisimilitude by Michael Douglas and Matt Damon in Behind The Candelabra. This film directed by Steven Soderbergh should have received a big screen release.There's a whole generation of people who have grown up and another one growing who have no knowledge of Liberace the entertainer. Now with so many show business celebrities never even entering the closet let alone emerging it almost seems quaint how Liberace took such pains to hide who and what he was as if such a flamboyant personality ever could.With the kind of wealth he amassed Liberace could get just about anyone he wanted and on his own terms. So when young Scott Thorson came back stage one fine afternoon and Liberace took one look at him it was lust at first sight. His current flame went and Scott was ensconced in the palatial estate in Las Vegas which he lived in luxury as a kept boy toy.These relationships are always dangerous. Scott may have the attractiveness, but Liberace had the money and the power. Years ago when I worked at New York State Crime Victims Board I had a case where a man in his 60s was killed and left a surviving partner in his 40s and they had been together for about 20 years. It was a relationship like Liberace and Thorson had. The older man was a business executive and the younger did nothing but keep house. Because there was no same sex marriage when the older man died, the younger inherited nothing that was not in his name. But worse than that he had no job or trade he could fall back on, he was completely dependent on the older for support. Scott Thorson wanted to be a veterinarian when he met Liberace. I'm sure he's sorry he didn't learn some kind of job to fall back on. The palimony suit that he brought against Liberace was out of sheer necessity.Douglas and Damon bring both men alive for a younger generation, more importantly a younger generation of LGBT young people who can see what it was like in the bad old days which aren't quite over. The two truly dominate the film, but Debbie Reynolds as Liberace venerated mother and Dan Aykroyd as business manager Seymour Heller and most of all Rob Lowe as a quack doctor who hooks Damon on diet pills are quite memorable. Matt Damon who is getting on should have done this project in the 90s. But his skill pulls off the part where he's clearly too old.I recommend this film highly for young gay audiences.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Fully fleshed out biopic and character study,"If this is indeed Steven Soderbergh's last film (as he's gone on record saying) then that'll just be a darn shame because he's one of the few working directors that can turn out films of this standard at a rate of twice a year.Behind the Candelabra focuses on the life of Liberace (Michael Douglas) for the six years that he spent with his lover Scott Thurston played by Matt Damon. With the exception of the scenes of Liberace performing in Vegas the film isn't too showy and instead uses extended bouts of dialogue and relationship troubles between the characters to propel the film. This works to a degree as Douglas is doing some fantastic work here and the way Matt Damon evolves throughout the film is a testament to how good of an actor he really is. That being said there are moments where the film sags and its episodic nature grows a tad grating throughout the run time.I can see why the film had to be this long however as it aims to track how the relationship grew out of one based on power and control on the part of Liberace and began to fester after years of this dynamic, but surely there could have been a scene of drug taking or plastic surgery that could have been cut.As someone who wasn't at all familiar with the story of Liberace I found this film to entertain and enlighten on the subject of the Las Vegas entertainment industry and the closeted homosexuality of public figures during this time. So if you're in the mood for a slow burn character study of some larger than life figures while also witnessing the swansong of Soderbergh (for the time being) check it out.I still don't know what a candelabra is.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Solid performances in a serviceable but lacking film.,"After struggling to find a home to find a home for several years, Steven Soderbergh's long-talked about Liberace has finally graced our screens after a wonderful reception at the Cannes Film Festival, only this time it was brought directly to our small screens in the form of HBO. Soderbergh claimed that studio executives chose not to finance the film because they deemed it ""too gay"". Its a shame that such a thing would occur in this day and age. Instead of the possible Academy Award recognition the film could have received, it will now compete amongst television. Though that's better than nothing.Any awards consideration this film would have been for its acting, which is the most appealing feature of the film. Behind the Candelabra is a well made film that follows Scott Thorson (Matt Damon) and how his life changes after he engages in a complicated relationship with famous musician Liberace (Michael Douglas). The film does a wonderful job at education those who are unaware of who Liberace actually was, thanks to Michael Douglas's terrific performance. Every once in a while, we see an actor we are this familiar with completely disappear into a role. Douglas brings Liberace to life and is fully convincing in the role. While watching him, we get a great sense of how Douglas actually understands the man, that there is heart and reason behind the physicality of it all.The film, although about Liberace, is not a biopic. It merely follows Liberace the same way that Scott Thorson does and from that time period only. Damon plays Scott as a complicated and misguided young man. He maintains throughout the film that he is bisexual and not completely gay, yet we have to decide for ourselves just how much he loves Liberace, if he loves him at all. When they first meet, Scott's eyes are wide open and he absorbs everything that the man is. Clearly he is fascinated with him, but it's easy to determine that Scott is quite confused, and not just with his sexuality. As he befriends, and slowly but surely starts dating Liberace, we wonder if this is what Scott truly wants as much as he wonders it.The relationship between the two main characters is bizarre to say the least. Liberace wishes to not only be with Scott and have a sexual relationship with him, he decides he wants to legally adopt him. He wants to be his father, his brother, his best friend, and his lover. He wants Scott to get surgery to look more like him. Exactly what makes Liberace desire this? The film doesn't explore any territory that Scott doesn't get exposed to and it uses him as a means of trying to understand Liberace. However the audience starts to lose sight of Scott when he gets dragged in to the 'California' lifestyle.The film holds your attention throughout but never attempts to dazzle the viewer. The story almost steps aside and lets the acting take command of the screen, and the film does not disappoint in that aspect. However, relying on acting alone to completely engage the audience is not an easy task. Even with actors as wonderful as Douglas and Damon, its hard to not watch a film such as this and wish it just had a little something more to make it more memorable. Soderbergh claims that this will be his last film in quite some time, although he has claimed that before. I hope one day he returns and reminds us that he's the same director who brought us Traffic.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
The sex life of an aging Liberace...why did anyone wish to explore this?,"Atrocious cable-film which garnered critical praise, awards and--most importantly--high ratings upon its debut on HBO. Michael Douglas never begins to suggest piano-playing showman Liberace in this adaptation of Scott Thorson's book, despite the costumes and make-up and wigs. This was something of a comeback for Douglas after a real-life bout with cancer, but there's nothing here for the actor to play (it's all externals). Matt Damon fares a bit better in the role of Thorson, Liberace's sneaky, snarky young lover; however, the surrounding milieu, the show-biz razzle-dazzle and atmospherics fail to come off. A major disappointment from the estimable Steven Soderbergh, who certainly got no assistance from Richard LaGravenese's flimsy, turgid teleplay. Liberace deserved better, big numbers or not.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Fun to watch Douglas trying to impersonate Liberace,"I was never a Liberace fan (although I never disliked him), and I strongly dislike both Michael Douglas and Matt Damon. I would never willingly see anything with either of those two actors in it. So why on earth did I watch this? I don't know, but I enjoyed it!Neither of them is really a good actor. They obviously thought (and millions seem to agree) that they were breaking brave new ground and showcasing their immense talents in these roles, but they were just playing the same characters they (and all other Hollywood A-listers) always play: themselves, with enough makeup and choreography and voice coaching to vary the monotony enough to satisfy the mindless masses who pay to see them on screen.The best I can say about Damon is that most of the time he's easy to ignore in this movie, at least when he has clothes on; his body is so weird that it hurts my eyes, but there's nearly always something interesting to look away at. His barely-suppressed homophobia (Damon's, not the character's) comes shining through in the interview on the DVD, and it comes in handy when he gets to repulse a request Douglas makes in one of their many sex scenes. That's only one of many reasons Damon has always given me the creeps: homosexuality gives HIM the creeps.But Douglas... Ahhhh! He's nothing like Liberace, but I had a ball watching him just being little Michael Douglas speaking with a funny voice, moving in a funny way, and sporting killer makeup and killer duds. There's something fascinating about him despite my intense dislike of him as both a person and an actor.Enjoying this movie won't turn me into a fan, but it was fun for the couple of hours it lasted. Not great fun, but fun enough not to turn off, which is quite a feat for a big-budget Hollywood movie.One complaint: it was stupid to have Douglas recite rather than sing ""The Impossible Dream"" in his last scene. Liberace was a competent singer, and since Douglas evidently can't sing it was dumb not to have a singer dub his voice then. It could have been done seamlessly so the audience never suspected it wasn't him singing. His plodding recitation of the song's silly lyrics ruined what might otherwise have been a fabulous scene. It doesn't matter that Liberace recited it himself; it should have been sung in that scene.",,Anonymous,Music
Decent but far from great,"Steven Soderbergh has been a prolific director, making many films the Oceans films, Traffic, Erin Brockovich, Contagion, etc Behind the Candelabra is set to be last film (watch this space), a bio-pic about the pianist Liberace and his relationship with a much younger man, Scott Thorson. Despite being nominated for the Palme d'Or at Cannes and earning a theatrical release in Europe, Behind the Candelabra was considered 'too gay' by Hollywood and was only a TV film in America.Scott (Matt Damon) is a young bisexual man who wants to become a vet. His friend introduces him to Liberace (Michael Douglas) after a concert and Liberace is a man who gets what he wants. Liberace hires Scott as his personal helper and the two embark on a relationship. But Scott falls for Liberace's manipulations and falls into a world of drugs as the relationship soars.The best aspect of Behind the Candelabra is cast. The film has a great cast, as well as Damon and Douglas there are there are top actors such as Dan Aykroyd, Scott Bakula and Rob Lowe in supporting roles and there were all strong. But it is the Damon and Douglas show as Damon plays a young man who has a decent personality and gets corrupted by Liberace into a world of drugs and Liberace is made out to be a creepy, manipulative figure during his courting of Scott.Behind the Candelabra is a thematic film exploring a few ideas. One of them is the corruption of Scott's character from a decent caring man who degrades from his ambition to someone who falls into a world of glamour, drugs and dependence on diet pills. Whilst Liberace is creepy in the way he wheels Scott into his world and the film explore the idea on whether he was looking for a lover or a son/clone/successor: he actually tries physically alter Scott into himself via plastic surgery and Liberace's previous partner who dressed just like him. Liberace is made out to be a very controlling figure, who wants a puppet and if they show any resistance Liberace will ditch them want he finds someone else. Another theme is about Liberace who despite his highly camp persona seems to be very ashamed of his sexuality, hiding it from the public and hiding Scott from the majority of people.Behind the Candelabra was made with the intend of being a cinematic release, but it did look and feel like a TV film, which is disappointing considering that Soderbergh directed. Soderbergh and his team do try to make a Boogie Nights style film with its frank look at sex, its time period and Scott going through a rise and fall (though he is a smarter character): but there is no flair that Soderbergh is known for and this is film crying out for it. There are some nice little camera movements but on the whole this is a film that plays it very safe with its visuals. Even worst is the slow pace pacing, especially at the end where the film feels like it is going on and on.Tonally the film starts off a fairly light hearted comic tone with some decent jokes that should raise a smile and chuckle. But as the film processes it turns darker and more serious as we explore this relationship, how Liberace uses Scott and how Scott falls into drug taking. It is a fine procession with the film having its sinister underbelly and gets explored gradually exposed.As you would expect from a film about Liberace the music is excellent and Marvin Hamlisch does supply an great score to compliment the film.At the time of this review Behind the Candelabra has a 93% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. But the 7.1/10 rating on IMDb is much more actuate because the film is decent and no more then that.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Filled with bad homosexual stereotypes!,"'BEHIND THE CANDELABRA': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Supposedly director Steven Soderbergh's last film is this made-for-TV biopic about the last ten years of Liberace's life and his six-year affair with Scott Thorson. Michael Douglas stars as Liberace and Matt Damon also stars as Thorson. Richard LaGravenese wrote the screenplay, which is based on the autobiographical book ('Behind the Candelabra: My Life with Liberace') by Thorson and Alex Thorleifson. The performances are great and the makeup is really impressive but the movie as a whole is too dark and depressing.The film begins in 1977 when Scott Thorson (Damon) was just 17. He had grown up in multiple foster homes and was then working as an animal trainer for films. He meets a producer named Bob Black (Scott Bakula), at a gay bar, and Black then introduces him to the famous pianist Liberace (Douglas), backstage at one of his shows. Liberace was a sex obsessed (but closeted) homosexual who was immediately attracted to the young Thorson (who was bisexual). He throws his current lover (and musical protégé), Billy Leatherwood (Cheyenne Jackson), out on the streets and seduces Scott, while also offering him a job. Scott leaves his adoptive parents and moves in with Liberace, who totally begins controlling his life (including altering his face, through plastic surgery, to look like him).I'm not a fan of biopics (although the ones I've seen recently, before this one, have been better than those of years past) and I didn't enjoy this film for that reason (as well as many others). I found the Liberace character to be way too unlikeable and the film itself to be way too disturbing and sad. The way Liberace preyed on a teen, Scott Thorson, and ruined his life is just devastating. If it's true to life than I understand the filmmakers' intentions but I don't think the movie offers anything of emotional or inspirational value. It's just a very dark and gloomy look at life in the celebrity world (it's also filled with a lot of bad homosexual stereotypes). Douglas and Damon are outstanding in their roles (like I said), the makeup is amazing and Soderbergh's directing is once again topnotch but I didn't care for the characters or story at all.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOD_FVRPTm4",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Spot on portrayals of of Lee & Scott,"Liberace was a brilliantly gifted Maestro who never disappointed his fans despite the most viciously mean spirited and relentless attacks against Liberace's art, craft & personal life's flaw's. Critics misrepresenting themselves as knowledgeable in music, on any, level, only succeeded in showing their gross ignorance about Liberace's, or anybody's music career. Behind The Candelabra brought Liberace to life again, and humanized him again for his millions of fans who continue to appreciate the Maestro's brilliance in his art & craft. The lifelong dedication Liberace held for his art & craft fearlessly tore down barriers against high art in his quest to bring high art to the masses. Others before him, Chopin, Beethoven, Debussy, Mozart also were persecuted and very misunderstood nor appreciated for their cultural contributions to their art & craft. Mercifully what is most interesting to Liberace's fans here,is not what his critics think & say, that never ceases, as on these very pages here. Dostoyevsky put it best when he wrote in great detail how the masses most despise the art's, they pretend to revere. Maybe Liberace might never be truly recognized as the rosetta stone for piano music, he is. But, if it is not about art, surely it is a love story, and though shallow a love story, let's be honest, its very appropriate since it's not Liberace's point of view, But Scott Thorson's point of view that this story is all about. Also what is not said, is Scott Thorson's predatory penchant for stooping however low necessary to support his lifelong penchant as a dope addict. If were truly honest about pointing fingers then, though Liberace was deeply flawed, so was Scott and in the end the one cancels out the other and were left with a very tragic love story.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Great Fun, Sad Lives","The New York music critic, Lewis Funke, described Liberace's piano playing as 'sentimental as possibleall showmanship topped by whipped cream and cherries.'To the critics and discerning musical audiences,Liberace was little short of the Anti-Christ – a sort of talented André Rieu. But like Rieu, Liberace was unfazed by the vitriol that came his way. He gave a large swathe of the public – mainly blue rinse women of a certain age - exactly what they wanted, made no apology for it, and profited handsomely. Famously he responded that, upset at the criticism, 'I cried all the way to the bank.' He later amended this to say he went on to buy the bank.More serious for him was any implied suggestion that he might be 'a fruit' as homosexuals were then often disparagingly called. In 1959, Cassandra in the British Daily Mirror,described Liberace as being ""...the summit of sex - the pinnacle of masculine, feminine, and neuter. Everything that he, she, and it can ever want...a deadly, winking, sniggering, snuggling, chromium-plated,scent-impregnated, luminous, quivering, giggling, fruit-flavoured,mincing, ice-covered heap of mother love."" Liberace sued for the implication and won the case, perjuring himself in the London High Court by denying his sexuality.It seems incredible now that anyone could have been in doubt as to Liberace's sexuality. Times were different then and by the mores of that era, Liberace had to ensure that his loyal fan base was deceived. Were the truth to have emerged, his career would have been ruined and he liable for criminal prosecution.Behind the Candelabra, as the title suggests, looks at Liberace's rather seedy and debauched private life from the 1970s when he was in his late 50s. His career had long since peaked but he could still command massive fees and audiences for his Las Vegas shows full of chintz, glitz and glamour. The film follows a standard, slightly old-fashioned, biopic formula not so different from The Glenn Miller Story of nearly sixty years hence. It details Liberace's relationship with a much younger man who he inveigles into his life as chauffeur, secretary, companion and lover, eventually and inevitably boring of him and moving onto someone new and younger.Neither of the main protagonists, Liberace (Michael Douglas) or his young lover Scott Thorson (Matt Damon), present as sympathetic figures –Liberace is portrayed as a manipulative ogre, petulant and spoilt in a manner unique to someone to whom nobody ever says no. Thorson is a chancer and user, happy to live a useless, lazy lifestyle as the toy-boy of a wealthy golden daddy, stealing from him as his drug habit spirals out of control. What raises the film above the ordinary is an ensemble cast whose acting and delivery without exception is supreme.Michael Douglas gives a pitch perfect portrayal as the ageing lothario. In the few scenes showing Liberace performing, he radiates the man's stage presence and charisma, contrasting his far from edifying off-stage persona. Douglas's miming of piano playing is also good though not always well synchronised.It is unfortunate that the film was not released to theatres in the United States, showing only on television, thus precluding Douglas from receiving an Oscar nomination which would be well deserved.Matt Damon, although far older than Scott Thorson at the time of his relationship, matches Douglas nicely as he moves from youthful naïvety to embittered and worthless gigolo. I've been less than kind about Damon's acting in the past when he did little more than recite lines. But he now seems incapable of putting in anything other than a strong showing.Though the film concentrates on Douglas and Damon, there is still plenty of opportunity for great cameos from a few well known faces. Dan Ackroyd has fun as Liberace's manager; the veteran Debbie Reynolds likewise as the devoted mother. Funnier still is Rob Lowe as plastic surgeon to the stars, Dr Jack Startz. Lowe's face is pinched, taut and lifeless resembling an Afghan Hound,personifying the specious vanity in trying to hold back the years.If Steven Soderbergh is to be believed, this is his last film after a 25 year career as a director. Should it be that he has lost the passion and has nothing more to contribute, then so be it. But I hope that proves not to be the case. Soderbergh has made some great films since his debut with Sex, Lies and Videotape; earlier this year his thriller Side Effects was a fine example of that genre. Let's hope he has a nice sabbatical and returns refreshed. Hollywood can ill afford to lose his talent.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

My candle-lighting pop style sows happiness around (Signed) Sincerely Yours,"Being a fan of biopics is, of course, a state of mind and an indication of probable empathy with the biographed celebrity, according to their identity. Not liking biopics, I think it's less a prejudice than a post-concept. Personally, I got tired of listening to Liberace as a child because my father owned several of his records, including-my favorite-the one that introduced me to an excerpt from Liszt's Concerto #2 for piano and orchestra. What fascinates me in this biopic is the cast largely unrecognizable thanks to the excellence of the makeup artists. Michael Douglas, Dan Aykroyd, Rob Lowe and especially Debbie Reynolds are - in the best sense of the phrase - irreproachably beyond recognition. Like Tom & Viv, like Coco & Igor, like Capote & Harper Lee, like Freud & Jung, and like several other recent biopics that have transcended the format in order to examine in depth very particular types of relationships, this one relives an particular period of the last century (1977-1981) that people remember, sometimes with sadness, sometimes with nostalgia, sometimes with... shall I call it Kitsch-phobia?",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Good Performances!,"'Behind the Candelabra' offers Good Performances by Two Terrific Actors -- Michael Douglas & Matt Damon. Enacting Liberace & his lover Scott Thorson respectively, Douglas & Damon are uninhibited & fearless in their portrayals. Its their sheer work here that outdoes everything else!'Behind the Candelabra' is Based on the tempestuous, yet troubled, 6-year relationship between Liberace & his (much younger) lover, Scott Thorson.Steven Soderbergh Directs 'Behind the Candelabra' with confidence, but the Adapted Screenplay Written by Richard LaGravenese is half-baked & monotonous. While the relationship between Liberace & Scott Thorson is well-developed, the sequences, after a while, get so repetitive, that I was getting restless. The Final Act is depressing, but Soderbergh handles it with enough patience. I wasn't disappointed by Soderbergh's Direction at all, but the Adapted Screenplay did underwhelm me.Performance-Wise: Michael Douglas as Liberace & Matt Damon as Scott Thorson, are fearless & uninhibited. Their on-screen chemistry, also, is pitch-perfect. Rob Lowe, in a smaller part, is earnest. Dan Aykroyd is adequate.On the whole, 'Behind the Candelabra' works due to its strong leading performances.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Great Performance in a Good Movie,"His performance as Liberace is amazing first of all, he is really good and pulls off the drama and emotions very well but is also very believable and funny. The movie is very entertaining and so is his character. I did not honestly believe he would pull off this part so well but he did great and I hope he goes on to win even more awards than just the Emmy he just picked up. I'm not sure how real the story is or if the 'based on a true story' facts are actually true to life or how much so but he is great, the supporting cast is OK and the movie over all is good so it is definitely worth checking out if you have not seen it yet.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Luckily this film did not qualify for Oscar's as they would have had to saw the Best Actor in half for Damon and Douglas.,"A film a about Liberace, especially a 'TV movie' would have held no attraction for me to watch. But on hearing it was directed by Soderburgh caught my attention. My jaw dropped with the casting. Michael Douglas as Liberace? What? Really??? Matt Damon as his 'friend'??? Rob Low as the plastic surgeon???? My first thoughts on awareness from this movie, I live in England, was TV movie about Liberace was why would I like trash movies made for cable. Or satellite. Whichever. Not a studio film a HBO movie. All the possibilities just swirled around my mind of a film made about an artist I had little interest in. But the talent involved in cast and crew just kind of nailed it for me. It was a must see. I did not expect much from it because it being a possible disaster actually started to perturb me. Such talent together HAD to make a decent movie. It would be on their filmography forever. Then I watched it. Then I watched it again. And as of now four times this is why. NO SPOILERS.Michael Douglas was stunning. I was again anxious of him getting the part wrong to become offensive. There was nothing offensive in his role. I was dragged in to the part he was playing not as some people feel how good his acting out of his normal role and this Is Michael Douglas playing this role as I understand some viewers may be distracted by understandably. For me HE WAS Liberace and I was divulged in interest in his life rather than the lurid and offensive things written about his very strange life. The Matt Damon role role and how he would pull off a character he does not normally play from the start opening scenes went very quickly from worry to who is and how the characters life unfolds. Rob Lowe, yes Rob Lowe!, was engrossing as a plastic surgeon to make for the first time from being engrossed to stand back and think is this role deliberately comedic or frightening. Sank in quickly it was both.The story moves on I think quite slowly for some and I understand that. Personally I was just so engulfed in such complicated lifestyles. With things unspoken or spoken brutally between characters. Things wanted and not received. Love wanted and sometimes hidden, given, retracted and back and jumbled so much you can feel the complexity of life and what we should hide, show, be frightened to show and pushing away the ones we love.For me it was a rollercoaster of emotion which at times was painful to watch. It made me laugh. But it also made me cry. Both more than once.Some viewers may be unsettled by explicit sex scenes in movies. If so dont watch. I dont find myself sex scenes offensive, of any sexuality, if in the context of the movie. But we are all different and I would not accuse anyone of being homophobic. But if you watch it you should expect what is shown in the film and not watch it in the first place. I have refrained from looking at other reviews here in case they are homophobic but I know IMDB does not accept such things anyway. I am straight. But live and live. But the point of the movie is not about some big reveal about the sexuality of Liberace. I am still stunned people would watch him live and not be unaware of it??? But again live and let live for them.In final, yes I know that was long, the film is about life, love, incredible talent and living life under mask of who you really are in the fear of losing your life. And, and I dont call this a spoiler, the effects on your life because of fear, showmanship, grief, loss and unfortunate unknown at that time consequenes.My only regret of this movie, as in the title of review if you have read this far, it did not qualify for Oscar's. It appears to be becoming a forgotten and hidden gem now. And last regret is I could not give it 11 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A Missed Opportunity,"THE GOOD: The cast has many stars including Douglas, Damon, Akroyd, Bakula and Debbie Reynolds. The costumes are excessive and fun. The film gives us a salacious look into Liberace's private life. THE BAD: The acting is two dimensional, despite the cast, which says something bad about the script. The story is not very interesting. The main characters are a gay man who came of age in the 1950's and another gay man who came of age in the 1970's. The characters could have showed us the challenges and scars that came with having to be closeted or suffering discrimination, and how their experiences differed. Also, the opportunity to dramatize the deadliest medical scourge since the plague, i.e. AIDS, was not mined for much plot at all. All the characters were superficial. I would have been disappointed or even agitated had I spent $10 to see this movie. I Red Boxed it for a buck. I can't recommend it it even for a dollar.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Son of Liberace,"The film ""Behind the Candelabra"" covers the last ten years in the life of the great piano playing Valentino Liberace, Michael Douglas, or known as just plain Lee to his friends who at the time was pushing 60 and looking for some new companionship in his life. Liberace found it with 18 year old veterinarian assailant Scott Thorson played by an almost unrecognizable with his hair bleached blond and puffed up cheeks, ""like Marlon Brando in The Godfather"", Matt Damon. It was in fact Scott curing Liberace's pet dog ""Baby Boy"" that really turned him on to Scott who was flattered by the, what he was known at the time and all throughout his adult life, Worlds Greatest Entertainer's personal attention.Rplacing Lee's two top houseboys Billy Leatherwood and Carlucci, Cheyenne Jackson & Bruce Ramsey, Scott now became his bosses Liberace or Leiber-Archie as his step mom Rose Carracappa, Jane Morris, called him main man in the Liberace household. Things were going great for a while for both Scott and Lee until Liberace like some crazed 1930's and 1940's movie mad scientist decide to make Scott, through cosmetic surgery, into his own image. Liberace hires quack doctor Jack Stantz, Rob Lowe, to work on the very reluctant Scott who was very satisfied with his already God-given good looks to make him look more like himself. The crazy Doc Stantz in fact got Scott addicted on drugs, legal & illegal, that tuned him almost overnight into a street corner drug addict.Liberace who refused to take responsibility in what he turned his #1 houseboy Scott Thorson into soon got tied of him and the hot and heavy, in and out of bed, relationship between the two started to cool of. After a five year live-in relationship Scott now on the brink of becoming homeless sued his former boss and lover Liberace for 113 million dollars, just a drop in the bucket in Liberace far flung assets, in a ground breaking palimony suite. As things sadly turned out for Scott he ended up getting a meager $95,000.00 together with two beat up cars and two of Liberace's pet dogs in an out of court settlement instead.It's later when Liberace came down with the deadly AIDS virus that the two former lovers got together for the last time and kissed and made up with Scott promising the dying Liberace that he'll keep his some five year relationship with him secret and out of the public eye. From what I got from all this is that either Liberace was too ill or Scott too hooked on drugs to realize that if the two came to some financial understanding, like having taken care of Scott's money needs, that book written about Liberace's secret lifestyle ""Behind the Candelabra"" by an almost destitute money strapped and drug addicted Scott Thorton, which the film is based on, would have never been written in the first place!P.S Liberace's fame never wavered even for a moment with his both old and new fans alike. Even in the last year of his life in Liberace having sold out to standing room only every show, some 50 of them, that he did in the fall of 1986 just months before his death. As for his using a candelabra as a prop on his piano that became synonymous with the great Liberace he got that idea from watching the 1945 movie, when he was at the time a completely unknown, ""A Song to Remember"" with Paul Muni Merle Oberon & Cornel Wilde. In fact it was Liberace not the movie that inspired him to put it into his act that made the Candelabra famous!",,Anonymous,Music

Bravely Honest Performances,"From the opening blast of Donna Summer's ""I Feel Love"" to the closing riffs on ""The Impossible Dream,"" you know you are in for a real treat, especially thanks to excellent performances all around. Michael Douglas and Matt Damon are revelations here--these two performances, I think, rank among their very best, not only for being pitch-perfect, and often quite funny, but for being brave, honest, no-holds-barred, and most of all, faithful--personality flaws and all--to their characters, which stay with you long after the final curtain drops. Both actors deserve Emmy Awards for these performances. Sensitive direction raises the story from the merely sordid and tawdry to the realm of tragedy. Bravo to all involved.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Unfortunately, it is boring, very boring","The only good news is that nothing stands in the way of making a good movie about Liberace. Because this one isn't it. Truly, it even fails as entertainment. The problem? A bad script.The acting is acceptable, even good, if one ignores that homosexuality is cruelly caricatured. This can be done since, after all, the delusional life of Liberace (as depicted) probably would make caricatures of us all, gay, straight, or else. However, the differentiation is not made entirely clear so, meh, on the job of cast.Liberace led an incredible life and was an incredible man. Yet, we supposed to sit through the crashing of a run-of-the-mill relationship because it is set in glitter. If at least this were a love story...Unfortunately, it is boring, very boring.",,Anonymous,Music
Glorious and glitzy yet intimate and interesting,"I can't stand Michael Douglas as an actor. His mere presence is enough to put me off a movie from the outset. So hearing that he was the star of Behind the Candelabra, playing Liberace, made my heart sink. Then the reviews started coming in, gushing about how good he, and the movie, were, how thoughtful and reflective his performance was, how Matt Damon worked as a his foil.So I knew that I had to overcome my Douglas-phobia and venture forth boldly to my local cinema to see what all the fuss was about. And I have to say, the gushing reviews weren't wrong and Michael Douglas in particular nails a fantastic performance as Lee, resisting the temptation to play his role for cheap laughs or high camp and instead delivering a tender, human, thoroughly convincing portrayal of a man who combined complexity and simplicity it would appear as key character traits.Matt Damon similarly inhabits his role as Scott, the slightly confused and bedazzled young lover, who learns the pain of the real world in a slowly creeping and shabby way. Their relationship is the key to this film, to the point that it almost struck me that what you're seeing is some kind of glamorous kitchen sink drama at heart, with an increasingly angry young man railing against the unfairness of everything, without having the ability to see how he is an architect of his own misfortune.Support performances are all strong, even though they are also incidental to what's at the heart of the story in many ways. Rob Lowe in particular as the plastic surgeon shines and impresses with his bizarre visage. The look of the 70's is spot on, the script bowls along at a good pace, and the tender way that proceedings are wrapped up bought a tear to my eye and a lump to my throat. A beautiful heartfelt warm movie that will make you smile and lets you sneak behind the sequins to a real human show.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A must see,"From the very beginning of the film I knew this was going to be a rock solid drama. The trailer is completely accurately gives you a sneak peak into a great film that has all you want; believable acting, costumes, setting, musical performance and surprisingly comedy.There are sex scenes to those you might be ambiguous about seeing this movie. They are quite tolerable as you don't see any penetration or anything too vulgar. There is one scene with Matt Damon onto top of Michael Douglas that is quick and not graphic. Most of the sex is discussed or occurs of screen.Mostly surprisingly as I mentioned before is the comedy element. It is not obvious if it was intentional or a result of us now knowing what these well dressed men were up to. Either way Rob Lowe's stiff facial expressions are poignantly funny.If you have any interest in seeing this film I highly recommend that you do see it. Films like these don't come along that often; it gives shows us Liberace's lifestyle, his showmanship, the nature of gay relationships in the 70's & 80's, and has a respectfully emotional ending.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Great acting, but the movie is so-so","Although I thought all the acting was great, I was not really enthused about this movie. It shows Liberace - who we all know was gay - in a relationship that ended similarly to others before it had. There was no great revelation or interesting point to key on. Liberace dies and the movie pretty much ends. I'm wondering why this movie was made. And I support gay rights. One of my good friends is gay. So this doesn't have to do with discrimination. It's really just that there was nothing of any real depth here. I think this was based on the book by Scott Thorson and if the movie is any indication, it was just written (and the movie was just filmed) to make some cash. There is nothing that truly contributes to understanding Liberace at anything other than a superficial level.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Fine Film on Lee's Final Years,"It was initially disappointing to hear the difficulty encountered in trying to find a Hollywood studio to take on this project. When HBO finally signed on, thanks to Jerry Weintraub, and to be a made-for-TV movie, expectations for its success dropped a bit.However, as it turned out, this was just the right sponsorship for a candid dramatization of the final decade of a great entertainer's life and career. Steven Soderbergh's direction is sharp and honest. Michael Douglas outdoes himself as Liberace, creating a full blooded character, never a caricature. This is a difficult acting feat, since the subject was such an ostentatious showman.Matt Damon likewise does a fine job as Scorr Thorson, and Debbie Reynolds is virtually unrecognizable as Lee's mother. The production values are excellent, and the film emerges as a genuine success..The film rightly won the Critic Choice TV Award, TCA Award and numerous Emmys, all in keeping with the project's commendable quality production.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
88 keys to the magic kingdom,"This seriously funny and quite heartbreaking biography of Liberace works so completely well that you actually forget what the real Liberace looked like. The fearless performances of both Douglas and Damon with astonishing support from a hilariously well cast Rob Lowe make this film one of the best of 2013. Unfortunately nobody will win an Oscar for any thing to do here because it was a TV movie in the 'States. Internationally it was released successfully in cinemas. With excellent and humorous production values, a lot also filmed in the Liberace museum and home and with some key scenes lifted directly from his awful 1955 romantic drama SINCERELY YOURS, Soderberg's terrific and emotional film literally 'hits all the right notes' for me and ends up being quite a moving experience. Ghastly behavior, petty jealousies and a wry eye for the outrageous, BEHIND THE CANDELABRA would have been a serious Oscar winner had it made the cinemas and not cable. What Damon and Douglas agreed to do nude in this film is as astonishing as the story itself. It is hilariously explicit and with jaw-dropping costumes they clearly enjoyed making this film. Imagine LA CAGE AUX FOLLES in Palm Springs with grand pianos. Great to also see Debbie Reynolds aged 80 on screen still as Momma, hamming it up and celebrating over 50 years as a headline actress.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
The story of a dumb talentless person invited in a life of luxury by a manipulative selfish monster,"I liked this film at first not knowing anything about Liberace going in, and I enjoyed it. It is a behind the scenes portrait of Liberace as a gay icon and interesting drama between a famous star and a naïve nobody.The immediate problem is that the drama is not as interesting as it appears to be. The underlying tension of this love-story is that they are gay at a time where it is taboo. Yet there is not much else. Liberace appears as a cynical, materialistic, narcissistic, toxic, controlling being. Scott Thorson is vapid, ignorant, naïve and stupid. It is almost a joke to say that they are made for each other. Except they really are not, and once you step out of the film, you realise it is the story of two terrible people being awful to each other. It is not a love story. It is not really a nice story. It is a story of a relationship with someone who is richer. The fact they are gay is incidental.I initially felt that this film was above average. Then I stumbled on the documentary/home-film ""the World of Liberace"" and I had to revise my appreciation of this film as merely average. Given how it completely misses Liberace as a persona.I was flabbergasted to discover Liberace, the performer but also the public figure. I discovered a talented pianist who had an incredible onstage charisma. Even if this movie's premise is that there is a contradiction between Liberace as a persona and him as a regular person, the movie never explores this. It is a shame because that is really interesting, more so than Scott Thornson's botched surgery chronicles. Which is this film's major focus. In any case, Liberace was a complete caricature. Yet he came across witty and wholesome. It was tacky but there was something clever, a subtle wink. There was self-awareness. He was in on the joke.That is why Liberace's performances worked and were fun to watch. Real Liberace feels instantly likeable despite the excess and the eccentricity. Michael Douglas' interpretation makes him despicable. In his act, he showed off his diamond encrusted watch to the audience. He actually did it for real. Yet, it is part of the spectacle, it is part of the persona, the joke is that it is so extravagant and over the top. He would invite the audience to marvel in the excess and participate in it. ""You paid for it"" he would say to include the audience in it. The Douglas version brags about the watch to inform them how better he is than the poor schmucks that come to watch his shows. It reeks of disdain.It is very reminiscent of Magic Mike, which is obvious since it is the same director. However, even if both films are about a rather straightforward romance in a an unusual setting, it feels like Magic Mike had that little something this film lacks, which is heart.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Broken Candelabra,"Or just plain ""Liberace"" as it is called in Germany. I wasn't aware of much of his life as it is, but one things is obvious from the moment he steps on screen. And by ""he"" I mean Michael Douglas as Liberace: He is into men! And Michael Douglas who is famous for being overly sexual with women playing that role is a big risk. Or one could think it is. But watching this, you could say this was a master plan.Matt Damon is of course the character we as viewers should feel attached to. And it makes sense (if you are not too homophobic), his actions and what he is doing in the movie. There are not too many erotic scenes in the movie, which the movie does need anyway and might help it with a straight audience too. Acting wise this is great, although I heard this was meant to be a TV production, it did play in theaters in the UK and Germany.Rob Lowe is back too and he has a phenomenal performance even though he is just a bit player.

virtuosity behind and in front of the camera,"Soderbergh is a genius; the skill shown in this film is pure magic. Any director in the world can watch this and learn.

This vision is entirely focused on opening the viewers eyes onto the world he conjures up.Michael Douglas gives his best performance here, no mean feat, he seems to be wonderfully liberated from his usual persona (pretty obviously, as a gay character, but also in the emotional register) he makes the gift of a part wonderfully deep and moving.Damon is fearless and captivating as the toyboy, brilliant acting.This is a masterful film, behind the homosexual subject matter, which is potentially marginalizing for some, a classic love story, a transcendent work of art.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Well made, moving dramatisation of a very famous man","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningScott Thorsen (Matt Damon) was a young, naive farm boy who worked on movie sets, before he was introduced one night to entertainment giant Liberace (Michael Douglas) after a show, and became his lover, spending the late 70's and early 80's in his life before he was tumultuously thrown out, only to get his own back with a tell all book about their time together, before a brief reconciliation before Liberace's death in 1987.Steven Soderbergh's latest high profile biopic, which essentially serves as a temporary resurrection of a man who was once as big as Elvis or Sinatra, has managed to prove controversial for any number of reasons, not least of which was the casting of Matt Damon as a young man of eighteen, despite being 42 years of age himself. The first high point the movie strikes is pulling off the incredible feat of genuinely managing to make Damon look this age, a real masterstroke from the make up/lighting department. All the same, in a still largely conservative America, the film was deemed ""too gay"" for mainstream cinema goers, despite it's massive Oscar potential, and only managed to make it as a HBO TV movie, and doesn't manage to hide it's production values quite so convincingly. Some of the greatest sadness's are caused by a nonsense, since it's ridiculous to think most Americans wouldn't be forward thinking enough to enjoy this lavish, touching and highly impressive true life story.In the main roles, Douglas and Damon very bravely cast aside their tough guy personas to portray the original Elton John and David Furnish, only in a day and age where this kind of relationship had to be kept completely behind the scenes rather than plastered all over the front page of OK! Magazine, and it's testament that they manage to play them so well. As Liberace, Douglas captures the gay mannerisms and styles perfectly, showcasing a flamboyant character it seems inconceivable anyone could doubt was gay nowadays. He evokes a gentle innocence and dislike of confrontation, juxtaposed with a thin line between whether he has genuine love for Scott or a filthy, perverted lust. Meanwhile, Damon is explosive as the emotionally volatile, needy, unworldly wise Scott, who is never completely able to lose his affection for Liberace despite the worst treatment. Like a dog, the worse he's treated, the more he loves, though with this in mind it still doesn't take away from a deeply tender and heart-breaking ending.This isn't the type of movie I'd go out my way to see, but with nothing else on and being quite a fan of the lead star, I gave it a go and think I spent my time well. If the lead stars don't provide enough dramatic dynamism for you, there's still a lively supporting cast including Rob Lowe, Dan Ackroyd and Scott Bakula to ensure the characters working in the background for the main characters also get their less pivotal, but still highly relevant, inclusion. ****",9.0,Anonymous,Music
repellent,"This is truly a repulsive piece of film making.

Everyone knows that Liberace was gay. This movie certainly tells us about his sex life, or at least the version of his sex life as told by his paramour Scott Thorson in his tell-all book. There are always two sides to any story about a relationship, and here we never get to hear Liberace's. The fact that by all accounts Liberace was a generous contributor to charitable causes, encouraged rising talent, and was a congenial and loyal companion to his many show business friends - all of this is absent from this shockfest, or maybe shlockfest. As far as the acting, I was curious to see how Michael Douglas, whose work I admire, would handle the role. He turns in nothing more than a simmering, mincing, lisping, one-dimensional caricature. Evidently movie makers will sink to any depths to make a buck, and this is Exhibit A. Avoid this disgusting piece of trash at all costs.",1.0,Anonymous,Music

Not a Negative Claim to Make,"Being forcefully persuaded into seeing a film when you have no interest or knowledge of it is one thing; but to then be pleasantly surprised at your own delight and enjoyment of that very same film is certainly another. Behind the Candelabra follows the contextually tragic moments in the life of the musical entertainer Liberace, and unfortunately is likely to remain somewhat of a hidden treasure due to its limited release. The cinephiles that are fortunate enough to discover it beneath the grains of less humorous, less glamorous and less genuine cinematic offerings (which all still garner abundantly more popularity) will hopefully have discovered a truly refreshing gem of a drama film.Behind the Candelabra is a HBO Films production that has been reserved to a US television release as well as a limited European exhibition, due to its thematic content being ""too gay"" as director Steven Soderbergh articulated. This devastating justification from the Hollywood studios for not picking up the film is as tragic as Liberace's own fear for the economic impact and public reputation that he believed he would see diminish if his personal life were to be known. Sadly, as the majority of fans probably never knew of Liberace's true personality, today's majority will not have the pleasure of witnessing this pure and remarkably emotional biographical film.Despite the film itself being projected on screen, Soderbergh's true intentions are for the emotion of the film to be directed and projected onto us: the audience. Behind the Candelabra is truly enjoyed and experienced as a collective group with every other cinemagoer in the room, though you yourself will forget there is another soul in the theatre due to the emotionally investing 118 minute feature in front of your eyes that takes you away from your own reality and places you in an interpretation of Liberace's.Michael Douglas' magical performance as the once internationally renowned entertainer captivates your consciousness with his electric charm, fabulously worn costumes and overall tremendous acting ability. Douglas' performance however only constitutes 50% of the relationship that the film revolves around, and is irrelevant without Matt Damon's pivotal and magnificent portrayal of Liberace's other half, Scott Thornson. The relationship they share, IS the film. Without the two talents to confidently and charismatically carry Thornson and Liberace into the 21st century, the film would certainly fall apart and lack the sense of purity that the two actors manage to organically create as they collaborate. It is a great sadness to see the relationship stumble over avoidable hurdles, and conversely a thing of beauty to see the non- fictional characters high jump over obstacles to sustain their romance.Other features of the film greatly supplement the focal relationship and characters to a quite notable degree. While Douglas and Damon certainly carry the film, Soderbergh piles other cinematic elements atop of the actors' hands which make for a visually and audibly delightful experience. The costumes, sets, locations and most emphatically the soundtrack are powerfully incorporated to give Soderbergh's film an enjoyable charm, and while only supplementary to the core relationship, they are distinctly memorable due to their grandeur through both sight and sound.The only thing lacking in Behind the Candelabra is that there is nothing negative to criticise about the film. This is a rare feature of any motion picture, and it is the result of great filmmaking. Behind the Candelabra is consistently purposeful from one scene to the next. It is subtly humorous when appropriate, tragically emotional on cue and ultimately continuously engaging throughout. While it may not receive the attention it deserves, Behind the Candelabra remains amongst the best of the opening half of this year's film releases that I have seen, and particularly is the most genuine and purposeful.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
REALLY?  Good Reviews? Liberace?  LOL!,Liberace was a douche. He's even worse on film. Only the 70-80s lax era protected him. Liberace was every reason that idiot Christian crazies deny REALITY. Liberace embarrassed the LGBT community with his predator behavior. Liberace was not a mean man but he was a complete DOUCHE that bought @SS. I'm completely shocked that no one capped his @ss in Vegas. Separate the sexuality. He was a douche that thought $$$ bought him the right to use people. He was a maggot.,2.0,Anonymous,Music
Stunning and Tragic,"Seems strange to me that huge studios would pass up on a film like this considering its big line-up of A-list male screen actors; but I guess I'm more open minded than most of the motion picture viewing audiences. This film wasn't anymore gay than ""ShowGirls"" was misogynist, objectifying and offensive, and it had far more depth and was way more interesting.Michael Douglas and Matt Damon, Dan Ackroyd, and Rob Lowe give absolutely stunning and brilliant performances in this movie. I mean wow...what talent...Until this film, I hadn't realized what incredible range Michael Douglas.What may be surprising to most is that being so wealthy and not all that good looking really, Liberace had no shortage of boy toys at his disposal. Not all of them were prostitutes.The film dramatically chronicles the dramatic twists, nightmares and pleasures he ran into when he got into a relationship with a 16 year old known by the name of Scott Thorson. The film does not spend that much time talking about the LIberace's grueling lucrative career and famous persona",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Excellent Bio Pic,"Beyond the CandelabraWith a subject as over the top as Liberace, one would expect an element of caricature to be unavoidable in a film about any part of his life, let alone the last years that received so much publicity throughout the world. Instead, this film gives the viewer a fully realized human being flaws as well as fine points. Liberace is fully formed in the beginning of the film. Still growing is Liberace's companion, Scott who transforms from the somewhat naive rube into a man who has become accustomed to the extravagances of wealth commingled with tinges of fame. The actors responsible for these two men's portrayals are simply amazing. Michael Douglas allows himself to be changed chameleon-like into the aging, smothering, sometimes disingenuous, and always entertaining Liberace. Matt Damon brings vulnerability, acquiescence, and disenchantment to the role of Scott Thorson. This film, while giving the viewer enormous excess in so many areas costumes, interior design, personal adornment, sexual encounters. creates a genuine world, no matter how flawed and filled with intrigue, that is inhabited by real people. The film does not let up. The film does not shy away from the impolite or trashy. Innuendo has no place here. The reality of these lives and their lifestyles simmer with humanity, shortsightedness, and betrayal. Michael Douglas, known from The Jewel of the Nile through Fatal Attraction to Wall Street, completely transforms himself into the persona of Liberace. He is magnetic in both directions he attracts and then he repulses. He welcomes and then he rejects. He proclaims a Catholic spirituality and a sexual baseness with the same intensity and cinematic truth. His Liberace is sometimes hard to take, but always fascinating; his love for Scott is at once stifling and one sided and yet compelling and understandable. His larger than life public image is contrasted neatly with his sometimes small minded attention to the details of daily living. The one overriding aspect of this film is the depiction of the time: open, rebellious, and exploratory but colored by Liberace's attempt to deny his very being for the sake of the primitive attitudes of his conservative fan base. The film in some respects is as much about the man Liberace as it is about the social mores of that era. This film at some points is hard to take, but its refined grittiness never lags, and the viewer is continually pulled forward in this extravagant, sumptuous, and intense production.24 Aug 2014",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Garbage,"Michael Douglas looks and sounds absolutely nothing like Liberace, not to mention that he is too thin for the role. In any case he is too old for the part as he was actually older at the time of filming than Liberace was when he died. However far worse is the ridiculous miscasting of a 42-year-old Matt Damon as his teenage lover! Damon cannot pass for any younger than mid-30s so it doesn't make sense that he is still supposed to be living with his foster parents in the film. They should have cast an actor in his mid-20s and then it might have been believable. Scott was only 23 when his relationship with Liberace ended, yet they cast an actor two decades older which doesn't make any sense and completely changes the dynamics of the relationship.The whole production is tacky and low-budget. I'm amazed this got a cinema release in the UK, it should have been shown on television like in the US.0/10.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
I was blown away by this film!,"This film is about the relationship between the famous and flamboyant piano player and his young male friend.""Behind the Candelabra"" tells a fascinating story of Liberace and his lover Scott. Right from the first few minutes of the film, we are already taken into a world beyond imagination. The set depicting Liberace's residence is lavish beyond belief, and the costumes are dazzlingly amazing as well.Michael Douglas is very good as the piano star, as he portrays a very wide variety of states. He can be camp, authoritative, confident, loving and in despair all in the same movie. Everything about his performance as Liberace exudes a confident pink flavour. He is so natural and so into the role, that makes me have even more respect for him The make up artists deserve a special mention, as they transform Michael Douglas and Matt Damon with their superb make up skill. Whether it is an older, younger, debilitated or post plastic surgery look, they always look perfect.Two hours flew by as the story was very engaging. I feel sad for Liberace for him not being able to establish a lasting relationship. How he had to disguise a break up as a termination of employment was rather sad as well.""Behind the Candelabra"" is an excellent biographical film. I was completely blown away by it.",,Anonymous,Music
Great movie with great actors,"Behind the Candelbra is great fiesta of great actors. Script emphasizes brilliantly 70's and 80's zeitgeist when homosexuality was still forbidden and illegitimate. Michael Douglas sparkles as aging Liberace and Matt Damon is ingenious as young boy who falls in love with Liberace. Movie underlines finely how sinfulness show business is at the time period when artist should surely determine his career if telling to be homosexual. Movie tells sophisticated love story where Liberace can buy everything with his money, even love. Liberace fulfill his life loneliness with shopping everything he can, even young men. Matt Damon acts elegantly young man who falls in love for rich and famous older guy. Money, sex alcohol and drugs finally ends poor boys fairy tell from rags to riches. Movie doesn't underline Liberaces rich and luxury life who can buy everything with his money, even a love but tells a vulnerable love story. Even they love story ends belligerent divorce it is still nice to see that Scott was Liberaces true love. At his deathbed Liberace tells to Scott that he was his only true love.

Super !!,"Wow where can I start ? This is one of the best movies I've ever watched ( and I've watched many movies ). It has everything from a story line, to amazing actors to costumes etc. Michael Douglas and Matt Damon have done it and sealed the deal. This is the kind of movie that should win many awards especially Oscars. Its too bad the judges focus on other types of movies. I mean the chemistry Douglas and Damon had in this movie is unbeatable. This is what i call real acting skills. Michael Douglas got into the role so well ( with the smallest details ) that it gave me chills watching it. On a last note, Hollywood producers should do more movies like Behind the Candelabra and drop a lot of movie genres.This movie is a must watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
This is a trashy movie -- waste of time,"The content of this movie proved to be disgusting. So once again Hollywood is hard at work trying to tarnish and destroy a famous celebrity from days gone by. They seem to feel no sense of consciousness in displaying scene after scene of lurid and promiscuous details of Liberace's personal life. Yes he was a homosexual and probably did engage in dangerous sexual behavior, for which he paid the ultimate price. Seriously, does the general public need to know about his vanity and preoccupation with looking young? Also please leave out the bedroom love-making scenes between Michael Douglas and Matt Damon. Maybe I am in the minority, but watching men kissing each other, etc was revolting and actually turned my stomach. It saddens me that many great actors have chosen to waste their talent on this film. Dan Akroyd and Rob Lowe what were you thinking to pick this movie? I am not too surprised in Michael Douglas since he goes for shocking, violent films, such as Basic Instinct. I am very shocked to see Matt Damon playing this role. He was definitely the wrong choice being 40, since Scott was only 17 when their relationship started.Probably the younger audience (under 40) does not remember Liberace anyway. Still whatever good name he once had, has been totally shattered. I am of the older generation, who are still offended by this kind of morally degenerate portrayal of a star. I have read other reviews and some young viewers seem to accept this as status quo. So where do we draw the line on what is acceptable and what is not? Today the R-rated movies show every form of love-making and profanity. Nudity is generally accepted. Subjects which were taboo only 20 years ago are now widely included, such as homosexual love-making on the set. Frontal nudity was once excluded, but now we see it all the time. It really scares me to think what will come next. Hopefully, I will not be here anymore to find out.This is probably the worst review I have ever written. I try hard to find some redeeming light or feature which will help me be fair, but this time there is none to be found.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
"imperfect, but for what it achieves it's absorbing","Michael Douglas gets into this character - whether he IS Liberace, well, he is still a character in a movie ultimately, however true he may be to real life - is remarkable. Douglas has been playing characters for decades that have been like the 'Lover Man' types, the leading man with swagger and presence who you believe would have women flocking to him (Glenn Close, Sharon Stone in his prime, I'm sure there's more). Now he's in his 60's, but he's playing Liberace without missing a beat or stopping to go for broke, which is what Steven Soderbergh as director and Richard LaGravanese as writer goes for. This is a dark, flamboyant character with more layers and depth than it would appear on the surface. You might just look at Liberace and see a control freak (or just a freak in general), a megalomaniac, and an egotist, and that's in the first half. But it's his relationship with this guy Scott, played by Matt Damon, that makes it a full-blown character study and, in fact, a failed tale of romance and fame.Soderbergh captures the glitz and glamour, and the horror of this world too. Scott, as played by Matt Damon in a, frankly, slightly miscast role. Maybe ten years ago, when this film was planned, it would have worked, but Damon is now in his 40's, and he doesn't look or act quite young enough, much as he might try and it's sad to say as it's the only time he hasn't fully worked with this filmmaker. And yet, the writing and storytelling helps a bit, and when it comes time for Scott, who becomes Liberace's intense lover and confidant (for the most part) and almost his second in command at times, there's one last thing: he has to look... better for his old musical genius of a lover. So, plastic surgery.This was one of the things that stuck with me the most, how a person can change so drastically in such a landscape as in show-business - especially that around Las Vegas in the 70's and Liberace and that whole ball of wax - and change their look like THAT. Oh, and lest not forget Rob Lowe, who is so incredibly funny and horrifying at the same time to LOOK at. There's more cringe-comedy following the surgery, and the peaks and valleys of this relationship of this May/December romance. Soderbergh seems to be not shying away from the gaudy spectacle that was this world that Liberace had set up - and, ultimately, ended in tragedy for him, not altogether one he didn't bring on himself - but he shoots it with a level of class and sophistication; it's not too gaudy (though the color orange and red and yellow fix their way into the palette of the director's cinematography).In other words, the movie looks really good, the finale, especially if this had been Soderbergh's 'final' movie, is quite a way to go out, and the acting delivers on the sordid details making them feel palpable and, for as much as this kind of lurid and tempestuous narrative goes, real and full of hurt. Even as Damon, as I mentioned, doesn't totally work, he still tries to give it his all and it matters still. Douglas, after all, can't be as good as he is without some support, and at the least he's bringing his A game here. I don't know where it rests in this director's filmography, but it's up there as one of his toughest dramas and darkest comedies in one package. Oh, and get ready to SING! No, not really, but there's music a plenty here, and some of it, as kitschy as it is... it kind of works for how Soderbergh shoots it.Or, to put it another way - if a character from an 'Ocean's' movie took a left turn in the 70s, they could wind up in the dark corridor of... a Las Vegas concert room. So it goes.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Not too much insight but plenty of energy and color in this broad and professionally-mounted film,"Although it got very good reviews I didn't watch this film when it was released (as indeed it was in the UK, where it got a cinema release). I really didn't know much more about Liberace than his name and reputation, and to be honest didn't see any reason to really know more. I still felt that way before and after the film but despite this I did think ti was a really well crafted film that is worth seeing. Based on the autobiography of one of the two main characters, Candelabra follows the relation of Liberace and his young lover Scott Thorson. In doing so we see what type of person we have and generally how things went.I say generally because it is never a film that really gets inside the characters and explores them so much as it explores the events and broad flamboyant strokes. On that level it doesn't have much going for it but in the broad strokes it is quite excellent. The basic narrative is full of color and is engaging throughout as we see Scott go down the well- worn path that it was obvious he always good. Seeing this journey and then the added conclusions of Liberace is what makes the film work and it has a lot going on, with a sense of the flamboyant and comical throughout.Stylistically the film embraces the period and the lifestyle, with great sets, costumes, characters and sequences. The cast equally latch onto this. Douglas is great; really good energy and presence, and he is able at least to find a person in there that the script doesn't do as much to help him with. Likewise Damon is very good despite the person getting lost in the broad strokes. Support is mostly equally fun – particularly a turn from Rob Lowe, but the cast is deep in names and faces with Bakula, Aykroyd, Koechner, Reiser and others all getting the tone of the film.There may not be a lot of insight in here, but it is a film that has a great broad stroke and delivers it well, from the design of the film through to the performances. Well worth a look for what it does well, even if it is limited in certain areas.",,Anonymous,Music
shoo-in for a sweep of the raspberry awards.,"Hands downs the worst movie in memory. 2 or 3 notches below the worst soap operas. How could anyone give this a positive review? Matt Damon is 42 years old and played a 17 year old with a two dollar Halloween wig. Even Phil Spector would have been embarrassed to wear it. I really like Matt Damon but this has put a black mark on his resume. I only saw a sickly looking Mike Douglas in his cartoonish portrayal of Liberace. I know Liberace was sort of like a human cartoon himself but really this was either awful or the highest form of camp. If it was camp, it wasn't funny. Every other scene in this movie made me cringe or laugh. Mostly cringe. For a infinitely better portrayal of a gay man see Sean Penn in Milk.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
spectacular,"not only for mixture of kitsch and opulence, costumes and careful recreation of atmosphere. but for the art of Michael Douglas to recreate the isolation, selfishness, vulnerability of Liberace. for the admirable job of Matt Damon, victim in fascinating spider web. for the musical moments and for the gay air. and, sure, as parable about glory and the fall. a great show. this is its basic virtue. and the heart of a splendid story about a meeting, a trip and a love story who has all the ingredients of soap opera and little more. the good point - realistic picture of a career who seems be eccentric and fake and strange today but who defines the taste of public more than the life of Liberace.",,Anonymous,Music
Uncomfortable? Yes. Astounding? Absolutely.,"Okay, I want you to put yourself in the place of the actors in this film. If there were scenes in this movie that made you squirm and look away from the screen, imagine how it felt for Douglas and Damon. Those two gave their all for this picture and did an outstanding job. Is it the best movie ever made? No, but those two pulled it off without a flinch and made their way through scenes that surely made them uncomfortable and embarrassed. The story line flowed very well and gave us an in-depth look into the life of Liberace, which was flamboyant, disturbed and tragic. Douglas and Damon each deserved an Academy Award for their performances in this film. It's not really the film itself that rates 10 stars, but the performances alone elevated it to that level for me.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Pass the Popcorn Review,"Although it seemed that Steven Soderbergh would retire from film-making after finishing this year's Side Effects, he made another movie, Behind the Candelabra, and then stated he would just take a sabbatical. He might be just indecisive or he might be fooling us and doing it for the publicity, but after watching his last two movies I have to say it would be a shame to lose such an interesting and good director – and brave, I would add, since Behind the Candelabra was rejected by Hollywood movie studios because the story was considered ""too gay"", so he made it as a TV movie.This movie is based on the autobiographical novel 'Behind the Candelabra: My Life With Liberace' by Liberace's former lover Scott Thorson. Thorson (played by Matt Damon) and Liberace (Michael Douglas) met when the former was 17 and the latter 57. They started a sexual relationship and Thorson was also incorporated in Liberace's Las Vegas shows. He underwent plastic surgery to look more like Liberace, at the musician's request, and lived at his expenses. Their five-year relationship started to fall apart because of Liberace's promiscuity and Thorson's drug addiction.Behind the Candelabra is not just a simple biographic movie. It focuses mainly on the characters' relationship and growth as people, so it could be said that not much happens. Most of the scenes are shot indoors, and no character apart from Liberace and Thorson is really relevant. Thorson's evolution keeps the story going: in the beginning he's a healthy young man who wants to be a veterinarian, and then we watch him disappear, lose himself, becoming unable to control his life or his lover. When he tries to rebel, he is rejected and replaced. Liberace remains the same throughout the movie, but only in the end we realize that – he always grew tired of all his relationships.Douglas and Damon both deliver amazing, touching performances. Liberace's stage costumes, his and Thorson's outfits and the furniture in their houses are all over the top, but fit Liberace's persona perfectly, and Thorson's too, after he becomes sort of a clone of the famous musician. It is a truly great movie, but it might have been better had it concentrated more on Liberace's career and showman skills. In this version, it risks being seen as just another movie about bad relationships.Rating: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Music

The loneliness behind the glitz.....,"As a child I remember Liberace popping up from time to time on TV. Somehow even back then there was something ""unsettling"" about the man. It had nothing to do with his sexuality, as I child that mean't little to me. What I do remember is thinking the facade the man presented to the world hid something rather sad and empty.Behind the Candelabra, offers up an image of Liberace as a man who appears to have everything but, in fact, has nothing. Liberace as he admits himself, is a marketing product, Lee as he prefers to be called, worked very hard to create.There is too, no denying the man's musical talent or his intellect. His sharp humour and insight can not easily be dismissed. That said, for all his material success, his glitzy shows, expensive cars, overstated mansions and young paramours, Liberace was a lonely, isolated figure.Liberace is a victim of his own success and the times he lived in. He can not openly admit his sexual preferences for fear of losing his career and he can not be sure who his friends are and who is simply out to take advantage of his considerable wealth (for the large part of his time in show business he was the highest paid entertainer in the world).The result as this film ably shows, is a man who leads a strained, sad, rather superficial existence. Surrounded for the most part by quislings and hanger on's. A man so worried about his outward appearance he resorts to plastic surgery that leaves him sleeping with his eyes partly open. Indeed, even his partner Scott Thornson, is compelled to have surgery to look more like Liberace. It seems the only person Liberace can really trust in and have any measure of love for, is himself.Its a sad tale, with beautiful sets and a very camp feel to it. Michael Douglas hands in a excellent, if slightly overstated, performance as Liberace. Personally, I felt Matt Daemon was somewhat more convincing, as Liberace's partner, Scott Thorson.All in all this is an excellent, very interesting film, that explores the unglamorous reality that lurks behind the glitzy veneer of the US entertainment industry. Eight out of ten from me.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Carry on camping,"Wow! Camp overdrive. Camp overkill!You have to remember that Lee Liberace was the most flamboyantly gay entertainer showbiz has ever seen - even though he sued a British newspaper for hinting that he was a tad effeminate and went to his grave protesting his innocence from homosexuality.The part is a gift to an actor and Michael Douglas sinks his teeth into it with relish. He also sinks his teeth into Matt Damon (who wouldn't!) as Scott Thorsen, Lee's toyboy for six years who even underwent plastic surgery to make him look more like his new ""daddy"". Liberace was an egomaniac, vain, needy, voraciously sexual and vicious when he didn't get his own way. Thorsen (on whose biography the movie is based) tries to portray himself as both less and more than just a gold-digging opportunist. The screenplay suggests that this mismatched pair may - for a time anyway - have loved each other. Hell had no fury like Lee scorned and Thorsen, like his many predecessors, was moved on as briskly as he was moved in - and with a lot less in 'palimony' than he would get today; Liberace was outlandishly generous but he could also be stingy.All the kitsch of Mr Showmanship's life is here: the ludicrously furnished homes (Michael Jackson had the same hideous taste); the extravagantly costumed performances. His skill on the piano, however technically accomplished, always seemed like the keyboard equivalent of a drag show - every piece of music as over-decorated as his houses. Michael Douglas captures not just the style, but the very essence of this preening onstage/offstage monster; it seems unfair that because the movie has gone straight to cable TV in the US he will not be eligible for an Oscar.Matt Damon also clearly enjoys playing against his usual type and is very persuasive as a cocky young man enjoying the luxury of his new life but at the same time stifled by it. Rob Lowe goes gloriously camp as the plastic surgeon to the stars, with hair modelled on Lauren Bacall. Debbie Reynolds is unrecognisable in a cameo as Lee's money-grubbing momma - they should have built her part up more.This is the cruelest as well as the campest biopic since MOMMIE DEAREST. If this is director Steven Soderbergh's 'swansong', as he has promised, he's going out on a high. Everybody involved in this production pays pitch-perfect 'homage' to the over-the-top phenomenon that was Lee Liberace. Freddie Mercury and Elton John don't come close, though perhaps Quentin Crisp did. Liberace managed to be a gay version of both Frankenstein and the Creature!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Good, great performances","I've never really known anything about the events that happen during the course of the film, or anything about Liberace in fact. But I had definitely heard all of the praise it got at Cannes, and I do think it's a good film, just not a particularly great one. I don't think there's anything that makes it stand out in any way, and the only truly fantastic aspect of it is Douglas' performance. I have no idea how the real Liberace acts, but that doesn't really matter. Douglas created a fully- living character. Damon starts off not particularly anything, but he gets better and better as the film goes along, and both him and Douglas make some of the rough patches in the script work.Again, despite being based on real events, the arc here is pretty much a common one. I do think this is very much a worthy entry, and Douglas deserves accolades for his role here.",,Anonymous,Music
Wonderful Study of an Ill-Starred Love Affair,"BEHIND THE CANDELABRA looks at the man behind the myth of Liberace - entertainer, pianist extraordinaire and promiscuous homosexual. Michael Douglas is just wonderful in the role; he has the voice intonations absolutely right, as well as the body-language. His Liberace is so in love with his self-created myth that he cannot see beyond it; to say that he is massively self-centered is no understatement. At the same time Douglas portrays him as vulnerable; however much of a star he might have been, he needed young men to lean on as well as to take to bed. Matt Damon is equally wonderful as Liberace's much younger lover Scott Thorson; at first rather bemused that the celebrity should take such an interest in him, and then falling hopelessly and yet eternally in love. Steven Soderbergh's film begins quite humorously, with Douglas and Damon indulging in an elaborate courtship; but the tone soon changes as the film examines the lives of the ill-matched yet inseparable couple.

I guess, but I cant really laugh about it either, I rather feel a bit embarrassed watching it.Dont get me wrong, I usually love Matt Damon and Michael Douglas as actors, but I truly believe they failed at performing credible characters this time around.Suited for who? Liberace fans? Perhaps. But perhaps Liberace fans would be insulted by this movie? I dont know, cause I dont care for this Liberace figure to begin with, but the depiction of Liberace is done in a rather ridiculous way.I look upon this movie as another one of those experimental movies director Soderbergh likes to make now and then.

Matt Damon & Michael Douglas as you've never seen them before,"Michael Douglas stars as Liberace and Matt Damon as his young lover Scott. This story is about their relationship from the latter's point of view and is in parts drama, dark comedy and horror. The drama is in the pathetic and inevitable cycle of their relationship with the tragedy of addiction and aids on the side. The comedy is scattered through out and is provided by the grotesque entourage. The predatory nature of their relationship is quite horrific especially the intimate moments.Watching these actors stretch their acting abilities is quite amazing. Matt Damon gives an intense dramatic performance. He looks younger than of late even if a bit older than the character he is playing. Michael Douglas usually doesn't do biopics so it's fascinating to see him act as someone else instead of a fictional character. He does a good job suggesting Liberace without overacting getting his voice and mannerisms while not being too campy. Watch out for the supporting cast too especially an unrecognizable Debbie Reynolds as Liberace's mother and Rob Lowe - hilarious as an amphetamine pushing doctor from hell.The makeup is good transforming them into the characters and through their weight and plastic surgery changes. The mansions, cars, pianos and flamboyant shows are all there. Impressive for a TV movie. Well done Sodebergh. Deserves an Emmy or Golden Globe.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

one word...WOW!!!!,"There is one word that describes Behind the Candelabra and that is amazing! When I first heard about this HBO film I was very skeptical for many reasons the main one being that I knew little, if anything, about Liberace. This film changed that. It was very well done, Matt Damon was excellent, possibly his best role, and Michael Douglas was wonderful as usual in another example of him being one of the elite actors in cinematic history.Definitely shocking the first time you see how sexually graphic this movie is and it can be a shot to the system the first couple times you see Douglas and Damon kiss and...do other things...but please don't see them Michael Douglas and Matt Damon see them as Liberace and Scott Thorson. The best HBO movie ever without a doubt.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A fun celebrity story,"""Behind the Candelabra"" is a 2013 biographical drama directed by Steven Soderbergh (Traffic, Ocean's Eleven).It tells the story of Scott Thorson (Matt Damon), a young man working in a movie, who with the help of a producer gets to know Liberace (Michael Douglas), a famous pianist. Once they find out that they both share the same loneliness the two begin a secret relationship.The movie really exceeded my expectations, it would've been nice to see this in theaters, it might have even been very successful. It was pretty fun for a biographical movie, I was expecting something more serious and dramatic, but instead its an incredibly entertaining movie.About Soderbergh, I have become very interested in his career, I really hope he doesn't retire, he's one of the few directors who approach his work with passion. By the way, how nice of him to wait for Michael Douglas to finish his treatment for throat cancer to begin filming, which regarding his performance, was definitely worth it. Matt Damon is great in it too. They both made the romance believable and they both had their funny moments.I'd recommend it to people who liked ""Goodfellas"", ""The Intouchables"", ""The Social Network"", or ""Monster"".",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Geeky Randy's summary,"Drama about the secret affair Liberace (played terrifically by Douglas despite being a little too old and thin) had with a Scott Thorson (played by Damon, who is terrific as well, but is also too old for the role), a man nearly 40-years his junior. Based on Thorson's memoir of the same name (but subtitled ""My Life with Liberace""), lending itself to be a story inevitably driven more by perspective than fact. Screened theatrically overseas, but Hollywood dubbed it ""too gay"" for its native USA so HBO aired it instead. Outside of the serious scenes, the film is an otherwise lighthearted portrayal of the lavish life Liberace pursued with a companion that he was forced to pretend was his adopted son instead of his partner or husband. Really good film for the masses; but at the end of the day, it's still another gay-movie made by straight people—it didn't work when white people were writing sitcoms about black families, why do straight people think they can properly execute a meaningful story about gay people? Let the many talented gay people in the business take a shot at making a film about their culture and history that will appeal to people of all sexual preferences. Perhaps we're not ready for it yet... it's obvious Hollywood isn't.★★★ (out of four stars)",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A Compelling Story,"I really wanted to see Behind the Candelabra but was a bit unsure. I like films to be conventional dramas and thought this movie could get a bit weird. I was completely wrong. It was a fascinating bio pic about the relationship of evanescent Liberace (played by Michael Douglas) and what was a teenage Scott Thorson (played ironically by 40 year old Matt Damon). It is a compelling drama as you watch the shifting levels of power between the two men. Both characters, while flawed seem genuinely nice people and have a real affection for each other, something that surprised me a great deal. Douglas and Damon have been nominated for Golden Globes. Although this is for television which also surprised me since it screened in cinemas in Australia. I guess some stories remain taboo for a long time. It is an interesting and well directed piece and well worth the two hours it takes to watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Sweet and Superbly Acted,","Behind the Candelabra is a terrific movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding cast. Capturing the life of world renowned musician Liberace at a certain phase of his career and personal life, the film manages to find a lovely balance between these two without making it feel overstuffed or putting too much focus on one aspect. Huge credit deservedly goes to director Steven Soderbergh in bringing this all to life, between the camera work, set and costumes, this world is brought to our very eyes marvelously.The only issue I would have that is worth mentioning is that there was very little scope put in to any character bar Liberace and Scott Thorson. Of course, I understand that the film revolves around their story and relationship, but I felt we could have gotten a bit more development from other characters that also served a huge importance to this plot, but unfortunately come across as two dimensional.Michael Douglas and Matt Damon are absolutely outstanding in their respective roles, both going against the grain of what we had come to expect from them as performers. Douglas knocks it out of the park as Liberace, bringing this larger than life, animated being to life in a way that never comes across as mimicry, but genuinely authenticity, while Damon really grounds the story with a part that is much more tame and human.Riveting and enjoyable. Spellbinding performances and superb direction, Behind the Candelabra is most certainly worth the watch for anyone looking for a good biography film.Chronicles the six year relationship between superstar Liberace and his young lover.Best Performance: Michael Douglas",8.0,Anonymous,Music
To much of a good thing is never bad! Michael Douglas shines as the legendary gay figure!,"I always wanted to know the story of Liberace I remember as a young kid when he died of AIDS, I must say that this HBO original movie from Steven Soderbergh captures the life story almost perfect. The film called ""Behind the Candelabra"" is based some on the autobiographical novel of the 6 year relationship between the yours truly and the much younger lover Scott Thorson. Starting in 1977 at the height of Liberace's fame and popularity a young ranch and farm hand in Northern California a young bisexual man named Scott Thorson(Matt Damon)is able to meet Liberace in Las Vegas thru one of his gay connections. And soon after attending more and more of the legendary pianist concerts and events young Scott is taken under the wings and seduction spell of the fabulous and flamboyant pianist called the one and only Liberace(in a beautiful and shining performance from Michael Douglas). This love affair would last nearly 6 years the relationship comes to it's highest points in Liberace's Las Vegas mansion. Going all the way thru the couple's rocky times when Liberace cheated on Scott with a younger man till the legendary musician's death of AIDS in early 1987 this is one autobiographical film that can't be missed as it goes behind the scenes of a legendary gay relationship it's a historical shine.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
The failures of Matt DAMON,"Just have seen on Netflix discs two films by Damon, both of which he should wish destroyed for good. In Behind the Candelabra he plays a gay or partly gay young man attracted to ugly Liberace, well played by Michael Douglas. Hard to believe relationship. Then I saw Suburbicon, about the Damon character having his wife killed to marry his sister in law, while the neighbors make life miserable for the black couple with boy who moved into the white suburb. Everyone dies except the ones who are innocent. Damon here also should be ashamed. Does he need the money so much?",1.0,Anonymous,Music
I wasn't hooked by the plot,"""I love to give the people a good time.""Behind the Candelabra is Steven Soderbergh's latest film based on the autobiographical novel written by Scot Thorson (Liberace's former lover). It is an HBO original movie, but it didn't feel like a TV movie considering Soderbergh was at the helm of this project. The film does a great job of recreating the flamboyant excess of Liberace's life and his hidden love affair with Thorson. The performances from Matt Damon and Michael Douglas were very powerful and I believed their characters. I loved the look of the film and the 70's hairstyles is what kind of stood out above everything else. Damon and Douglas go through some physical changes, and the makeup was done really well. I never felt it was false. Despite the look of the fim and the great performances I didn't feel there was anything special about the story. I felt it was very formulaic and pretty much similar to any other romantic biopic I've seen before. There was nothing groundbreaking here. I was bored throughout several moments and have to admit I got distracted and didn't pay too much attention to the story during the midway point. I didn't know anything about Liberace, but fans of the famous artist might enjoy this film which delves inside his private life.Scott Thorson's (Matt Damon) life changes dramatically when an acquaintance of his named Bob (Scott Bakula) who he met at a bar, introduces him to the star of the moment: Liberace (Michael Douglas). Liberace, who is in his mature years of stardom, has a liking for this young man and asks Scott to come work with him and live in Las Vegas. Scott accepts and they soon begin to have a relationship. Scott begins to enjoy the luxurious life that Liberace offers him, but soon the life of excess begins to take its toll on Scott after he is introduced to some drugs by Liberace's plastic surgeon, Dr. Jack Startz (Rob Lowe). Scott also begins to feel suffocated inside the big mansion because Liberace doesn't let him leave the house much. All these elements begin to take a toll on their relationship and what began as a promising life begins to affect him. Dan Aykroyd also has a supporting performance here as Liberace's manager.Rob Lowe and Dan Aykroyd's characters give the film some lighter and comedic moments, while Michael Douglas and Matt Damon have an interesting and believable chemistry together. They both went out of their comfort zone and took some roles we had never seen them play before. I had no issue with their performances or the overall look of the film, but I wasn't too hooked on the plot. I felt the story dragged at some points and I began to lose interest on the relationship between the two lead men. This isn't a film for everyone, but Soderbergh knows his craft and does a great job at setting the tone of the film.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Great film - and why is Michael Douglas not mentioned prominently in the credits?,"Who decides what actors are credited with ""Stars""? I'm appalled to see Michael Douglas' name mentioned 7th down the list - he plays the leading role, for goodness sake - and very well at that!I didn't know whether I would enjoy this film but was pleasantly surprised. Given the subject matter, the film was honest without being smutty and was an unbiased and balanced portrayal of the characters.I remember reading about Scott in the '80s and much of the press painted him as being quite greedy and nasty. This film shows that life with the super rich and glamorous is not all one imagines it to be and that there is a down side to everything. It left me feeling sympathy towards Liberace and Scott - and yes, I shed a tear at the end.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
some things you just have to accept,"I had heard some about Liberace before seeing Steven Soderbergh's ""Behind the Candelabra"", namely about his tendency to dress flamboyantly and his eventual death from AIDS. The movie shows him to be a more complex character than that, the type who simply would find young men, and then proverbially chew them up and spit them out.Michael Douglas, Matt Damon, and the rest all do a fine job in their roles. Although Liberace never came out as gay, I figure that most people probably suspected it; he was certainly the flasher. Without a doubt, this was one of Soderbergh's best movies. Definitely see it. Also starring are Debbie Reynolds (in her final role), Dan Aykroyd, Scott Bakula and Rob Lowe.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Mildly interesting,"Mildly interesting biopic/relationship-drama.

Passions in the world of kitsch and shallowness,"Many wealthy and/or famous people are factually incredulous and lonely as they are often unsure who their real friends and like-minders are (many will never find out as wealth or fame is maintained until the end). But when entertainment field and hidden sexuality come into question, then all inside and outside is boosted, resulting with ""drama queendom"", various ups and downs, occasional tragic events. Such were the last decades in the life of Liberace, an innovative entertainer who was almost unknown to me. Thanks to Behind the Candelabra, I can judge and assess the reasons of his enormous popularity and look into the glamorous life in L.A. during the years when AIDS hit most.The cast is brilliant, particularly the stars Michael Douglas as Liberace and Matt Damon as Scott Thorson - I believe they both deserve an Oscar, as it is not easy for straight actors to perform gay characters in such an ""open"" manner, with some nudity and sex scenes included... Moreover, Dan Aykroyd as Seymour Heller and Rob Lowe as Dr. Jack Startz are interesting roles, rather different from their usual ones.All in all, the movie is definitely for you if you like strong realistic dramas and have no ugh! views on gay lifestyle.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Kitsch extraordinaire plonks onto the small screen,"This years Cannes Film Festival main competition nominee is somewhat of a rarity, as the Steven Soderbergh biopic was an HBO sponsored television movie. To some extent this shows a growing trend for top directors to opt out of the Hollywood model and experiment with TV, often with great results.Based on the autobiographical book by Scott Thorson (portrayed in the movie by Matt Damon), the movie treads crystal, glitter and champagne-deep into the wild and wonderful world of kitsch extraordinaire Liberace (gleefully played out by Michael Douglas). Presented from the perspective of Liberace's most recognisable lover, Soderbergh delves into the extravagantly absurdly luscious lifestyle of Liberace together with his crazed mindset and restrictive destructive influence. Despite serving somewhat as to ridicule the famed artiste, Soderbergh does also present the more fragile, unfulfilled side of the spectacularly wealthy Las Vegas piano player, who attempted to live his life as if it was one of his on-stage spectacles. Thorson himself becomes intoxicated with the lifestyle, slowly supplanting his self-worth for a drug-like dependency on Liberace to the extent that he agrees for a plastic surgery, that would make the pair look related.""Behind the Candelabra"" was aptly heralded for the flawless portrayal of the flamboyant Liberace in what could well be Michael Douglas's best role and undoubtedly his most adventurous, posting him way outside his comfort zone. Coupled with a deliciously androgen Matt Damon and some superb bit part roles (especially by Rob Lowe as the otherworldly Dr. Jack Startz), Soderbergh excels in one department: character creation. Nonetheless once the characters waver on their initial freshness, even the sublime acting on hand fails to gloss over the lagging storytelling, which lacks both in emotion as well as in laughter, making it neither dramatic nor comedic, instead an amalgamate of unfulfilled potential. Much to my chagrin this TV docudrama (unfortunately it always possesses the characteristic TV feel to it) on the delightful life and times of Liberace and his consorts, dangles a big fish in front of the audience, but soon tasks patience falling into a monotone rhythm, which directs us towards the inevitable conclusion.The mundanity of everyday life does serve to push the point, that despite all the effort Liberace places on lavish and opulent surroundings, human life tends to fold back into the ordinary, where in turn the joys of life truly lie. Here however the focus on the exterior causes the inside to ring hollow, as Thorsten receives no true fulfilment in his decision to live with Liberace, his de facto sugar daddy, while Liberace gets so lost in the self-creation myth, that he fails to attach true meaning to those closest to him.""Behind the Candelabra"" does shine at times, much like the artist in question, but the overwhelming banality that drags the plot and lingers throughout the movie, coupled with the luscious extravagant performances, just might not fit the bill for many viewers, even if the initial delight of seeing Douglas's restrained mimicry and grins makes it a movie truly worth at least the effort of watching.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Absolutely Fabulosa!,"Brilliant biopic of the life and times of Lee and Scott, one of whom just happens to be a fantastically rich and famous showman. Camp and clever with a great sense of humour, all the actors are on perfect pitch: Matt Damon with his petulant stomping around the mansion in rhinestone budgie-smugglers; Michael Douglas with his cloying, snaky smiles; the territorial houseboy and the soon-to-be-replaced Billy Leatherwood. Watch out for Rob Lowe's scene stealing, darkly comic turn as the cosmetic surgeon spruiking the California Diet, which really is the icing on the cake.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A great film if Kenneth Russell had made it!,"An enjoyable film with knock-out performances by Michael Douglas and Matt Damon, but in the end it is a little dull and empty because it is simply yet another relationship film. It could be When Harry Met Sally - albeit gay and with a somewhat unhappy ending. It strikes me that by focussing purely on relationships an enormous chance has been missed: Liberace was an astonishing phenomenon in his day, there must be more tell and show about his motivation, his talents (which obviously extended way beyond just tickling the ivories), his background, his mother, etc etc. Imagine doing the same to James Brown, say, or David Bowie, you know, giving maybe five minutes of them on stage and the rest about their mundane love lives? Does it make sense? What a shame Kenneth Russell wasn't still around to knock this potentially amazing material into real shape. Then the film would have earned nine stars at least!",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Douglas is a revelation in this role,"Wladziu Valentino Liberace, known to the world simply by his Italian surname, by friends as Lee and by his family as Walter, was a genuinely talented and immensely flamboyant entertainer whose trademark was a candelabra on his grand piano but, behind his public persona, he was a rampant homosexual who seduced a series of younger men who became ornaments in his homes of ""palatial kitsch"". Director Steven Soderbergh has insisted that this bio-pic of Liberace is his final act, but is it a television movie or a theatrical film? The answer is both. Soderbergh claims that no Hollywood studio would finance such a revelatory and intimate portrait and therefore he made the work for America's HBO television network but, outside the United States, it has been shown in cinemas.One can perhaps understand, if not excuse, Hollywood's sensitivities since this is a remarkably frank, if generally sympathetic, portrayal, not least sexually (although little is actually seen). It is based on a memoir written by Scott Thorsen who met Liberace when the entertainer was 58 and spent five years in a relationship with him before a bitter break-up and the pianist's death from AIDS aged 67. Michael Douglas is brilliant as Liberace, utterly convincing as a man with all the riches he could want but desperate for true companionship and love. Matt Damon is impressive in the difficult support role and there are cameos from some surprising and barely recognisable stars: Rob Lowe, Dan Ackroyd and Debbie Reynolds.Liberace's love for Thorson was a strange and suffocating affair in which the performer required his young companion to undergo facial surgery to make him look like an earlier version of himself and take drugs to keep him slim, all the while confined to a gilded cage which required him to give all of his space, time, and dignity. So this is ultimately a profoundly sad work, not necessarily recommended for a New Year's Eve iTunes download (which is how we viewed it with friends) by definitely well worth seeing.",,Anonymous,Music
Almost too good to be true ... Ten Stars!,"PLAYING KETCHUP. WITH Hollywood FLIXX. MISSED IN L.A.Behind The Candelabra was viewed in Budapest on August 20, 2013. At long last, the Liberace Story, starring Mike Douglas as Lee-Berace and a bleached blonde Matt Damon as his younger lover, with Debbie Reynolds as Liberace's mother, also Rob Lowe as a sleazy pretty-boy dietary and beauty adviser looking too young to believe. A lush-plush Weinstein production that was surprisingly good. Viewed at the Pushkin Mozi in Budapest in a nice intimate 77 seat theater. This is the best work Douglas has done since Wall Street - kind of an amazing comeback for an actor who was on the ropes both career-wise and physically with cancer only two years ago. Douglas is spot-on as Liberace all the way and Damon is a sufficiently convincing bi-sexual lover. -- 180% removed from his usual Action Hero screen persona. The film was probably rejected by many people who just couldn't see ordinarily macho heroes like Douglas and Damon on screen as gay lovers, but director Sonderbergh makes the most of this counter to expectation casting. Damon also played a non action character in Sonderbergh's last film about fragging ...so it looks like Matt is now trying to be accepted as an actor, not just a star.There is plenty in this pic for the gay audience to chew on but aside from that this is a slam-bang biopic of one of the most flamboyant and popular entertainers of the mid XX century -- now perhaps largely forgotten because sexual gaieté has become so mundane that many may have forgotten how outrageous it was was for a figure so much in the public eye as Liberace was to flaunt it back then. Today this would be a story about gay marriage -- back then the issues were much more complicated.The pic only deals with the late career of this amazing showman from 1977 to 1985 when he died of AIDS. A newspaper headline announcing the early death of macho actor Rock Hudson Is seen momentarily to underline the fact that LIberace's demise from AIDS marked a turning point in public perception of this plague - especially in the entertainment world.Douglas is simply excellent -- arguably his best film ever!--but I would attribute Damon's success in portraying a gay to Sonderbergh's direction. The whole picture has class, while it could easily have been a cheap portrayal of a screaming drag queen catering to the Gay&Les crowd, which it most certainly is not! Some of the nude in bed scenes, man to man kissing scenes and the discussions between the actors of who gets to do whom and why in masculine love making may make some male viewers cringe, but this is one of the many things that makes this picture so true to life -- too true in fact for it to have been the box office smash it should have been. Also, the reconstruction of Liberace's on stage performances in Vegas with some amazing keyboard pyrotechnics is alone ""worth the price of admission"" and Douglas shines in all of these scenes -- to the point where you forget that this is the actor Mike Douglas! Bottom Line: One of then best pictures of the year, and Mike Douglas deserves the Best Actor Oscar without a doubt. If he doesn't get it somebody ought to eat their shoe ...",,Anonymous,Music

Brilliant,"In a fine performance, Michael Douglas is Liberace, not just playing him. His finest performance in many years the impersonation of the late renowned fine artist was impeccable.The film was a joy but with poignancy. We enter behind the scenes and closed doors for c lose look in what was out of bounds as long as he was alive. For the most part we like what we saw; a very wealthy and successful man who remained simple and humble, treating others very well. At the same time, he was lonely and under the impression love was something that could be bought in the form of young attractive men.Were there elements of kitsch? Yes there most certainly were, but this not a fault of the film but side effect of Liberace's opulent life, that the film brought to screen.Enjoyable, emotional and a roller-coaster of moods; Douglas ought to get an Oscar nomination!",,Anonymous,Music
