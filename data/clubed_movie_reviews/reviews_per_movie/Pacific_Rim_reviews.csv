A mindless must-see.,"I usually don't watch action films. They just aren't my sort of thing. However, my daughter insisted that I watch ""Pacific Rim"" and I was feeling absolutely horrible when I watched the film, as I had just gone through some painful surgery that morning. So, to take my mind off my aches, I gave it a try. And, thankfully, it turned out to be exactly the sort of tonic I needed--entertaining and crazy fun. While I didn't see it in the theater (the best way to see this type of movie), I did see it on a very large screen at home and watching it on a small screen is practically a waste of time. For once, I loved that a film has eye- popping visuals, explosions and action--and it manages to deliver an entertaining experience without leaving you feeling dumb for having enjoyed it--a problem too often associated with movie of this style. Well worth your time.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The drift is strong with this one,"Pacific Rim really surprised me when it was first released in 2013. My initial thought was that this was just gunna end up being another movie about Colossal sized monsters similar to Cloverfield or Godzilla only with a Hollywood big budget and while it shares some similarities to Godzilla it does stand out on it's own with it's unique monsters and awsome robots plus with the movie being directed by Guillermo del Toro it has a unique style to it that only Guillermo del Toro can bring to a movie.Pacific Rims story isn't a particularly complicated one but it's certainly got some interesting ideas. When the world is invaded by Colossal sized creatures known as Kaijus mankind bands together creating a defence against the Kaiju in the form of Colossal sized battle robots known as Jaegers each unique in style and armed to the teeth which are each piloted by two pilots who control the robot via neural interfaces the only problem is both pilots must be drift compatible meaning they have to be to link minds and create a stable neural link to be able to control the Jaeger during this both pilots share each other's memorys, feelings and thoughts. The Kaiju begin appearing faster than Jaegers can be assembled so with time running out before there are more Kaijus than Jaegers to fight them the last few remaining pilots prepare for a final assault on the portal the Kaijus are coming from.The movie is like a mix between Godzilla and Power Rangers only a lot more adult and with much better effects. The Jaeger robots look amazing especially when fighting against the Kaiju monsters. There's plenty of cool action scenes which show the Kaiju monsters being shot, blown up, punched by robot rocket fists and even decapitations.The characters are likable and interesting my favourite characters personally are the two mad scientists who dissect and study the Kaijus while they are meant to be the kind of comic relief of the movie they are very funny and likable both arguing over scientific theories and trying to prove each over wrong.I highly recommend watching this movie if your a fan of movies that feature Colossal sized monsters crashing through city's while fighting with Colosal sized robots with swords, guns and rocket fists. This isn't a movie intended for kids in case your wondering this movie is definitely for a more mature audience even though the synopsis for the movie sounds like it was made for kids who watch Transformers cartoons.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fun popcorn flick from a reliable director,"PACIFIC RIM is Guillermo del Toro's tribute to the kaiju and Japanese sci-fi movies of his youth; you know, the ones involving giant monsters trashing cities and huge robots sent out to protect mankind. I had an inkling he wanted to make this movie after the giant plant creature in HELLBOY 2; well, now he has.And this is a lot of fun, a decent popcorn flick for a change and a film that's well made enough to erase memories of the disappointing TRANSFORMERS movies. It's a great Hollywood tribute to Japanese cinema, filled with all of the wonderful effects and super-sized action that you'd hope for. Del Toro is one of those directors who hasn't made a bad film yet; you can always rely on him for entertainment.Sure, the stuff with the human characters isn't as interesting as the giant stuff. But at least we get plenty of British actors in the cast (Burn Gorman, Idris Elba, Rob Kazinsky, Charlie Hunnam) which keeps it fresh and interesting. The CGI effects are excellent, as you'd expect, and while the storyline is very predictable, that's not the point. The point is to deliver huge bouts of destructive action, and that's what del Toro does. And it's a lot of fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
You Have To Be In The Mood!,"Sometimes when I sit down and watch a movie I just want to be swept away and be dazzled with both sight and sound. The movies don't have to be dramatically perfect just capable of blowing all my sensors.Battleship and Pacific Rim are 2 of those movies.Pacific Rim takes a cool concept for a story, Monsters vs Machines and entwines a human element (the pilots) to result in a really fun extravaganza. The movie is not deep but has enough story to piece together the fighting sequences.Sit down, hit the lights, pump the volume, disengage brain and have a blast :)",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Do you remember what entertainment is?,"Entertainment is not just a story. It is not just drama or social commentary. It is not something that can be measured by terms like ""latest and greatest"" or ""cutting edge"". This movie is not Man of Steel or Star Trek into Darkness where there is a child-like obsession with being ""taken seriously"" by adding grotesque violence or depressing overtones. This is not Transformers 3 or the Hobbit where special effects and action scenes are a cluttered mess of ADD rave parties that try to up the excitement with jumpy editing. THIS IS A SINCERE MOVIE.Sure it has lack luster actors, but they are mixed with some fine ones as well. Yes this has giant robots and that is the main reason to see the film, but they are not just jingling keys in front of us. These action scenes have atmosphere. The fights are exciting because of anticipation and build up. This movie (while very flawed) should be a model example of popcorn entertainment. I came in, saw some good fights, and got a happy ending without bullshit. This was the kind of fun I remember as a kid.This is a movie (strangely enough like John Carter) that should just be enjoy. They may not have had the best plots or most original stories, but they had substance that can honestly be felt. Genuine love for what they are doing in the film and real effort in making us as the audience part of that fun. They can be dumb or dull, but it feels more like a circumstance of a rushed schedule or odd-ball casting. It feels like Hollywood at its best since they just want us to have a good time.I not only hope for a sequel, I hope for loving imitators who don't aspire to pretentious greatness (Rise of the Guardians), don't have something to immaturely prove (Man of Steel), and actually have their own story to tell even if its derivative (Star Trek into Darkness is not only a Rip-off of Wrath of con, but it is practically a sequel that is DEPENDANT on it).This is not the degradation of film, this is the much needed laxative in a world of fast edited adaptations, sequels, and reboots with emo endings.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Beats from beginning to end,"Lately movies that claim to be monsters and action have proved a complete failure, and, to be honest I thought this was not going to be the exception.Any change to see a real action movie with almost unstoppable battles monsters, and a dose of special effects so amazing you just leave you with your mouth open.Of course, not everything is good, but entertaining plot is somewhat similar to that of other films: The hero gets a big pain that leaves the battle, then when the world needs the triumphant return finds the love of his life between the two due to the bad, the nearly died, and finally live happily ever after (like a soap opera).We must clarify that thanks to special effects, battles, and good performances, the plot is not uncomfortable. I really think it's worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Epic in every proportion,"This film starts of with a monologue that explains in twenty seconds how big monsters start appearing from the sea and destroying everything. The only defence against them is to kick their heads in with massive robots. Cool! Starting so quickly out the blocks I expected this to be a fast paced action movie.It really isn't. About every film element ever used, runs its course before the inevitable big battle. You get a fall from grace, a rivalry, a training period, a love story, forgiveness, reconciliation, etc. etc.The battle sequences are epic, the monsters and robots are amazing, Kids especially will love them, and the action goes on and on.The dialogue is cheesier and hammier than a 60 foot pizza monsters, and coupled with the extended scope of this film can make watching it gruelling if you are not instantly gripped.This will keep any kids gripped for hours (nearly three of them) but if sci-fi isn't your thing get comfy and bring a pillow.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Enjoyable monster movie that doesn't pretend to be anything else,"Part of the reason I have started completely sitting out the summer blockbuster season is that I just got fed up going to crowded noisy cinemas to be disappointed by films that promised much but deliver just basic effects and little else. With Pacific Rim though, it is hard to feel this way because it is a film that has never pretended to be anything other than a Japanese inspired monster movie where big robots hit big aliens in a way that pretty much never makes much sense when you think about it. The plot is explained very quickly at the start of the film and we then jump into the future where the war we just learned about is reaching a peak. From here we have some doubt, some lessons to learn, barriers to overcome but really what we have are big special effects punching each other. And it works.It is easy to wring one's hands and say that blockbusters are the death of film, but all things have a place as long as they are done well and this is at least an honest and fun film. I say honest because it has no pretension to it – it is plain and simple a monster movie with a very big budget behind it. The effects are good, with good monster design and generally a sense of fun and energy to the deliver. Of course it is just effects hitting other effects but it works for what it is and at least does this well – unlike other films that would aspire to more but yet can't even do this with any skill. The action sequences are large and fun throughout and the soapy drama doesn't get in the way at all. The film is loaded with references which I mostly got – the voice of GLaDOS being my favorite one.The cast are not particularly famous but it doesn't matter since the effects are the stars here. That said I thought they did a good job, in particular I enjoyed seeing Elba, Day, Collins, Kikuchi and others in their various roles. Del Toro continues his love of all things geeky with this film and in terms of direction it looks good, with plenty going on but never not being clear and engaging.It isn't a brilliant film by any means but it is a straightforward one that is honest with the viewer. Robots punching monsters – that is all that is promised and on that it very much delivers. If this sounds like your thing then this will hit the spot no problem.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Not bad, not great","Unlike some, I had no problem with the high concept of the piece: Transformers vs Godzilla. It had a lot of potential. And when the movie concentrates on what we are all here to see (giant creatures and robots beating on each others with oil tankers and smashing through skyscrapers) it is very successful. But when things get quiet... less so. Too much time spent on ""Top Gun"" like fighter pilot shenanigans. Not enough nuance in the characterizations. An ultra linear plot with few attempts to confound expectations. The acting isn't bad - and isn't required to be great in this sort of film - but it is nothing special either. Sort of universally ""meh"". Good for a Blu Ray rental.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Loved this movie,"For the first time in many, many years with this movie I was taken away from the problems in my life and went to a place where those things didn't register anymore. It was almost magical. I had to keep reminding myself about the bad things in real life, but then a new robot vs monster battle happened and all the sudden that didn't matter any more. Total escapism done with excellent design attention and detail. Thank you GDT. You have to be an artist and a science fiction geek to appreciate this. I came out of the movie and realized all my problems were still there but I was also hearing the theme music in my head. Got the DVD now and I escape that way.

"Pacific Rim goes berserk with a great sense of wonder, camp and old-school action.","We all carry a great sense of wonder. It seems to hide away as we get older, but was always strong and persistent when we were children. We could sit down and really make something out of nothing physical, or tip our toy-box all over the floor and just go mad. Pacific Rim is Guillermo Del Toro at his most unleashed. He's been given the toys for his sandpit and has gone completely bonkers, but he has also created a sense of wonder from completely nothing.The plot is simple. Kaiju (monsters) from another dimension break through to ours and wage war on the planet and us humans must do what we can to stop them. So we build giant machines called Jaegers. General audiences are doing the worst thing by comparing this to Transformers or Battleship simply because of some simple image traits. Well I'm here to tell you that you're way off and also working comparisons in the wrong league. Del Toro has crafted an insane amalgamation of Sci-Fi, old-school thrills, special effects and brilliantly entertaining set pieces that all meld together in beautiful harmony, with just enough satisfying human moments and arcs that carry a nice balance of emotion and camp. It all blends well with the loopiness of it all. Its Guillermo Del Toro's trademarks turned up to 11, all while going nuts and having fun with his toys.There's just so much to love, that not even some minor pacing problems or a couple of sub-par performances can destroy the experience. Mainly its in the lesser background characters, but for me I'd say that Charlie Hunnam doesn't quite shine in the lead. He's certainly more than commendable, but he just doesn't break out here. Idris Elba steals the spotlight with a look and a bellowed delivery and its amusing to watch and Rinko Kikuchi has such an incredible skill with her mannerism and in her eyes, that's its a shock that she isn't in more films. Ron Perlman comes and goes and works his usual incredible moments.Pacific Rim is triumphant above the rest of the blockbuster herd. It knows what is missing from the norm and just goes crazy with it. Its a big, giant load of awesome fun. Prepare your jaw muscles, because you'll be smiling throughout.(Hint: Stay a couple of minutes into the end credits for an awesome additional scene)",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A breathtaking and colorful film with marvellous FX and well directed by Guillermo del Toro.,"This spectacular movies is well-suited to its subject , concerning a diverse team of scientists, soldiers united to destroy an alien race and igniting the ultimate battle between man and beasts. When monstrous creatures, the Kaiju, begin to emerge from the sea, humanity has no choice but to fight them with a special weapon, the Jaegers. Huge robots that are controlled by two pilots whose minds are connected through a neural bridge. A former pilot (Charlie Hunnan) and a trainee (Rinko Kikuchi) -under command of Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba)- are paired up to drive a seemingly obsolete special weapon in a desperate effort to save the world from the apocalypse. Go big or go extinct !. To fight monsters we created monsters !. Rise up !. The bigger they come, the harder we fight !. A new generation will rise up !.Impressive and overwhelming adventure in which a motley crew formed by scientists, pilots and soldiers embark on an incredible feat to defeat gigantic and powerful creatures. Guillermo Del Toro writes and directs the script for this science fiction blockbuster that delves unapologetically into the universe of Japanese monsters 'kaijus', the genre whose protagonists are usually great beasts like Godzilla or King Kong, and mixing with sub-genre of 'Giant robots' like Mazinger Z from Japanese manga and anime. Dealing with a wonderful team to drive a legendary but seemingly obsolete Jaeger from the past, together, they stand as mankind's last hope against the mounting apocalypse.This nail-biting movie contains noisy action , thrills , emotion and a lot of breathtaking battles including gigantic fights among monsters and robots crashing on ground and sea. The great robots and beasts themselves are really the big stars of the amazing show , delivering the necessary goods to surprise and wonder us .The film shows how the Jaegers are defenseless and on the verge of defeat against the invincible Kaiju. Therefore, the forces that defend humanity are forced to turn to unusual heroes: a former pilot and an inexperienced rookie who will control a legendary and obsolete Jaeger. Together they will represent the last final hope against the human apocalypse.This ¨Pacific Rim¨retools the original Japanese iconic components through the hyper-evolved wonder of 21st century CGI . With spectacular FX, nominated for a BAFTA and an Oscar, the film manages to turn a story that draws on the B-movie imagery into a grandiose and enormous spectacle full of action and adventure.This pleasant and attractive film was competently directed by Guillermo del Toro in his usual style. The film was acclaimed and praised by both audiences and critics. Toro is a good writer, producer and director with a special predilection for fantasy, horror and strange stories. Del Toro often photographs insects or takes images of them, as well as archangels, symbols and other religious elements. Guillermo is a film buff who usually shows dark atmospheres and sinister events in his films. Guillermo has made a lot of successful movies, such as: ""The shape of water, Cronos, Devil Backbone, Pan Labyrinth, Mímic, Hellboy I y II, Blade II, Pacific Rim, and Crimson Peak¨. Del Toro is also a prolific producer, his production works include blockbusters and acclaimed films, such as: ¨The Orphanage, Julia's Eyes, Biutiful, Kung Fu Panda 2, Mama, Puss in Boots¨, among others. Rating 7/10. Better than the ordinary average, although it is a bit long. The film will appeal to Guillermo del Toro enthusiasts. Being essential and indispensable observation. Followed by a similar but inferior sequel: ""Pacific Rim: Uprising"" (2018) by Steven S. DeKnight with John Boyega, Scott Eastwood , Cailee Spaeny, Burn Gorman, Charlie Day.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Robots, Monsters, and a lot of heart and soul and creative design","It was a curious thing being on line for certain Hollywood programmers in summer 2013, mediocre stuff like 2 Guns or White House Down that neither impressed nor offended too much, and then the split in hearing some other folks talking about Pacific Rim and how awful it looked.Perhaps I came to it with a small chip on the shoulder – this is THE Guillermo mother-flipping del Toro, after all, a man who has created dark, supremely designed imaginations with Pan's Labyrinth and the Hellboy movies, and here he is getting to take on stuff he loves in a completely B-movie landscape: gnarly monsters, giant robots, comic-book stakes, and action with some substance. And Pacific Rim, for what it set out to accomplish as a sensational blockbuster, reached its aims for what I wanted. When taken in total, it may not have much more or less action than a Man of Steel, but it is much smarter, or just more creative and skilled and knowing of its audience, in layering out its action set pieces, and even in the broad strokes it takes as, basically, a B-level Saturday matinée flick. Del Toro cares about these characters, or at least tries to, deep down, and can show some of that like with the Asian pilot Mako Maori.Is any of this deep? I'm still not sure. Does it need to be an artistic meditation on the cancelling of the apocalypse? Maybe another watch or two of five - because there will always be a part of me that can keep a hold on to an inner 13 year old - will bring that into focus. And aside from the monsters-and-robot work, which contains such good sights to behold, weight and depth to the designs, and the know-how to pace the action and to let us see it – in 2D, anyway, I didn't bother with 3D so I can't speak to that experience – there's some just good fun dialog (Charlie Day! Ron Perlman!!) and a sense that, 'Yes, this is a Godzilla experience, but we can still make it EXCITING'. So much of what I wanted this summer and only got in smaller doses (look at the end of the article for a bit on that) was in full-bloom in this production, which had a 190 million budget and the money looked like it was up on the screen, and not just in the CG but in the big sets and technology, and a story told by a Big Kid that would only hope the rest of the audience can genuinely feel like Big Kids if they aren't young already.In other words, the director accomplished what Michael Bay has, over and over again, failed to do: inspire wonder, and put some basic thought into the process itself, in story and craft, and without a large dollop of cynicism.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Monsters vs. Mechanical Monsters,"""Pacific Rim"" is a highly explosive, exhilarating, exuberant, energetic, and exciting hell of a ride. When I saw the trailers, I knew the action sequences would be massive in scale, but the film just blew me away because the scale was just incredibly enormous. Every action sequence in this film was just mind-blowing.Unlike ""Transformers"", this movie has a real sensible plot. Giant monsters (known as Kaijus) are the extraterrestrial beings that are currently ravaging Earth. However, they don't come from above the atmosphere, instead they come from beneath us. A portal in the bottom of the ocean serves as the method of transport these Kaijus use to reach us. These Kaijus are arriving one by one, and as they do, they increase in size. They're so massive in size (I reckon they're bigger than Godzilla) and the amount of destruction they cause is just indescribable.But the humans don't stand around doing nothing. They build their own monsters, gigantic robots known as Jaegars, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked by a neural bridge. This allows them to synchronize their movements. However, despite these mighty Jaegers, the seemingly bright future for the humans turn dim as they begin to lose the war against the Kaijus. All of this was clearly covered in the prologue, quickly but properly.Now that seems like a basic plot, but I can tell you that there's actually more than that and the story is deeper than it looks from the outside. ""Pacific Rim"" provides sensible explanations for the phenomenons that occurred in the film. Now I'm not a genius or a scientist, but the explanation is logical.The characters. Our protagonist is Raleigh Becket. He's had a bad time after his partner and older brother Yancy died in a battle against a Kaiju before. But he's recruited by Marshal Stacker Pentecost to pilot one of the four remaining Jaegers. His new partner is Mako Mori, a Japanese girl who wants to be a pilot to avenge the death of her family. Becket's and Mori's Jaeger is the American-made Gypsy Heart.The cast behind the characters were great too. Charlie Hunnam was terrific as Raleigh. Idris Elba gave a commanding performance as Stacker. Rinko Kikuchi rocked as Mako Mori. The chemistry between Hunnam and Kikuchi was excellent too. But I have to give special credit to Ron Perlman (who previously played in del Toro's ""Hellboy"" films) as the black marketeer Hannibal Chau who makes a living by dealing with Kaiju organs. He has style and charisma. I also loved Burn Gorman and Charlie Day as Dr. Hermann Gottlieb and Dr. Newton Geizler, respectively. Their chemistry was absolutely perfect and these two were just amazing.The visual effects were undoubtedly incredible. Everything was mind-blowing and the gigantic scale of the action sequences allows you to be fully immersed into the scene. And the sets were extremely magnificent and glorious. I did not feel any sense of boredom when I was watching this film. Even the drama scenes were enjoyable too. The scenes where explanations were uncovered were exciting too and the music is a prominent part of this.Guillermo del Toro also did a great job in his directing because I gradually became supportive of the Jaegers and every time they fought, I rooted for them to win. I became immersed into the movie. Every time a Jaeger was in trouble, I was rooting for them to get back up and fight back again. I wanted them to smash the Kaijus to pieces.""Pacific Rim"" is just simply awesome. Now, it may not be for everyone, but if you love action, giant monsters, and giant robots, you'll definitely love this. Or if you're just trying to have some fun, watch this. It's got both brains and brawn.Rating: 9/10Final Verdict: ""Pacific Rim"" is an amazing and explosive ride that is plenty of fun to watch, accompanied with dazzling visuals and a coherent plot.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Middle of the road.,"My two cents. I didn't love it and I didn't hate it. It was somewhere middle of the road for me. The good: Set Design, The effects(The best I have ever seen), 3D, Idris Elba, Ron Perlman. The Bad: The Script, Bad Casting.Charlie Hunnam is great on SOA, but he is pretty much a one note actor. He has no charisma at all in the film and is boring to watch. Rinko Kikuchi while pretty to look at, comes across as a Asian stereotype. Her and Hunnam have no chemistry together at all. For two people that are suppose to be link they sure don't act like it at all. Charlie Day good god, I guess he was suppose to be the comic relief. But he comes off annoying and most of his scenes could have been cut and would have improved the film.To be honest I found it over long and just OK. Which is a shame because I love Del Toro and really wanted this to be a huge hit for him. I think It really comes down to casting, as bland as the script is some actors with chemistry and charisma would have gone along way it make it a lot more enjoyable.So there you have it.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Darn Good Time at the Movies,"Within the opening 15 or so minutes Charlie Hunnam's voice-over establishes the reality of a future where monsters (the Kaiju) repeatedly invade earth, to stem this humans have created giant robots (Jaegers) to combat them in increasingly badass iterations. This opening does a great job in conveying the scope of a film which is big, not just regular big, but like, Jason Biggs in 1999 bigg. entering the cinema from a world where these events rarely occur is initially a lot to throw at the audience, but it's handled so effectively and without tongue in cheek that it quickly becomes a world I had a blast experiencing. Maybe it was the incredible effects shots of robot related destruction used as a throwaway shots, but what I think really sold the opening sequence and the film as a whole is the enthusiasm Del Toro clearly has for the story he's telling.The cast is essentially a rogues gallery of TV's better dramas playing variations on roles they've nailed in the past (see: Elba, Hunnam and Klattenhoff) and some inspired casting of It's Always Sunny's Charlie Day who, as should be expected provides some effective comedic relief. Added onto this the score comes courtesy of Ramin Djawadi who's masterful use of themes on Game of Thrones is carried over to this film for some great emotional cues and many a rad motif courtesy of Tom Morello on guitar.It's appropriate Del Toro has a Frankenstein adaptation lined up as a follow up project as Pacific Rim can at times can feel stitched together from all the sources of inspiration the film has. This comes from many areas such as Japanese manga, the personalities of the actors from previous films and the imagery of robots destroying buildings which transformers ran into the ground. But Del Toro succeeds time and time again at allowing these disparate elements to fit together believably by way of some very confident filmmaking. I could easily take issue with the oft hammy dialogue and macho relationships but where the film succeeds in other areas and revels in creativity trumps the dissatisfaction one could take from these scenes. I also found Hunnams character a tad lacking in charisma and internal conflict but whatever, it's not the end of the world. Oh wait, yes it is hahahahaThe films successes go beyond its imagery and continued invention within battle scenes as the script is very economical when it comes to pacing. The films battle scenes are so engaging and exciting due to clearly established stakes present which left me devoid of the ""action fatigue"" transformers loves to throw my way. And although the Kaiju battles seem to never be in short supply, the film essentially follows the rule of three when it comes to battle sequences and left me oh so satisfied.In conclusion, I give it points for being one of the funner summer blockbusters in recent memory, for being an original property and for its sheer tenacity to exist which all amount to what is just a darn good time at the movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Very Pleasant Surprise,"Let's be honest, lately we've seen so much ridiculously horrible alien invaders movies that even Independence Day is like a golden classic now. Battle L.A., Battleship, last Transformers movie (was it the 9th? 11th? I forgot!), District 9 (yes, it was horrible too) etc..So when I've heard about Pacific Rim I thought ""oh no, not another one"" and ignored it. Then, I saw the ratings and some reviews here on IMDb. OK another confession now, IMDb also let me down lately because people were voting like they've never seen a good movie or good script. Go look at Dark Knight Rising's IMDb rating, for God's sake! (my right eye began to twitch involuntary when I thought of Dark Knight Rising again.. aaarrrgghh)But then one day destiny did the job for me, here I was having nothing to do with spare time and an imax cinema with Pacific Rim. I looked at other movies, Wolverine - check, I've already been to, good movie. Red 2, check - it was great fun. World War Z, unfortunately check, waste of time. Pacific Rim? OK, why not? After 2,5 hours the lights were on again and I was sitting with a big grin on my face apologizing from everyone who worked for this movie.This is really amazing folks. This is old skool fun! This is really better than last 5 years' alien invasion movies all together! This just popped out from 80's with 2010's technology. Do not miss it! And try to catch it on imax 3D!

A film slightly better than what I expected,"Before watching PACIFIC RIM I noticed it had a lot of critics really hammered down on it and truth be told it really wasn't that bad. Then again I stopped listening to critics a long time ago. Although many would agree it could be somewhat overblown with special effects but it did have a decent plot. The acting wasn't the best but also not the worst. All the effects were very nicely done and the fight sequences were very engaging partly because the film established what was at stake before them.All in all, PACIFIC RIM isn't as bad as critics say it is in fact I think they might have been too harsh. The best way to see PACIFIC RIM is probably without expecting to much and to judge for yourself if you like it or not. For me it was good and better than expected and I would recommend it as a better alternative to a lot of other films out there.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"If I had seen this as a child, I would have messed myself because of the excitement","There were certain things I enjoyed as a child. One was giant monster movies such as Godzilla and another were giant robots. So this movie would have been right up my alley. It still is something I wanted to see as it is also very anime like in the way it plays out. It has an anime inspired look and also add the Guillermo Del Toro factor and you end up with one very cool action movie featuring giant mechanized robots fighting huge monsters that were even given the name they have in Japan, Kaiju. Granted, it was not perfect as the look of the film was spectacular and the action grand, the story just was a bit to by the numbers and the acting at time serviceable and at other times a bit like they were not being directed to do nothing more than to open and close their mouths. Still, Del Toro is more of a visual director in my view as I enjoy the first two Blade films equally, liking the first one's story better, but liking the overall style and look of the second better (Del Toro's).The story has the earth under assault. Some sort of rift has appeared in the Pacific Ocean and huge beasts are coming through causing havoc. At first, it is believed to be an isolated incident, but it turns out that these things keep coming. The earth reacts by building huge robots called Jaegers to combat this monsters. The Jaegers turn the tide momentarily, but the monsters that come through keep getting bigger and adapt their fighting style. A man who used to partner with his brother, piloting a Jaeger called the Gypsy Danger is working on a wall that is being erected to stop the Kaiju as the Jaegers and their pilots are being killed at an ever increasing rate. This man lost his brother and now is asked to team up and pilot the Gypsy Danger for one more mission to close the rift and stop the Kaiju from entering our world.Like I said, the film has great visuals and that is the star of the piece. So much so that I still give the film a nine despite the many flaws with the story. The robots look good and the monster pretty cool too as one of the monsters near the end even sprouts wings and resembles the Gamera nemesis Gyaos. However, I wish they did a bit more to make the monsters look a bit more distinct as the robots look all different, but the monsters tended to resemble one another. Still, there are some great fights and as I said with a Del Toro film it is usually the visuals that are the highlight and they do not disappoint here.So a fun movie to watch, at one point the pilot of the Gypsy Danger activates a rocket on the arm to make the robot punch harder and I was thinking ""Rocket Punch!"" from an anime I had seen as a kid. If they could have added a bit more humor to the film it would have been a near perfect film for me. The ending was a bit to predictable too. Overall, the experience was satisfying and I am a bit sad to see this film not doing better at the box office here as I would love to see a sequel mainly due to curiosity in how it would play out.

"Lying flat on my bed while watching, I really fell asleep","I can recite the lines in the trailer; that's how much I looked forward to this movie. But I fell asleep while watching it, literally. So disappointed. The comments made by people around me always start with ""horrible story"" and end up with ""perfect special effects though"". Truth to be told, I can totally foresee that, for nearly all action movies follow this trend. But I was wrong. There is no single twist surprising and the actress really can't act! What's wrong with her face?! She does not know how to smile, does she? Then the robots. Come on. These huge machines are unable to leave deep impression on audience. The fighting scenes are of great chaos-sea water, buildings, robots and monsters mix with each other so that I could only tell that something is moving in the screen. The finale eventually adds the last awful stroke. The only thing of this movie worth keeping is the theme song, boosting work efficiency.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Visually amazing, otherwise disappointing.","Decided to go see after reading so many user reviews of 8, 9 and 10. Absolutely love movies in this genre as well other movies that Del Toro has directed (e.g. Pan's Labyrinth, the Devils Backbone, Hellboy) I was expecting to be blown away - and yet, at one point during movie husband and I contemplated leaving. I don't understand how so much money can be spent and effort not made to create coherent script with believable characters. I can accept campiness if its done well - but the two scientists for example were just ridiculous.The amazing visual effects were what kept us in the theater - but just barley. Could clearly see Del Toro's mastery in the creation of the aliens and Jaegers.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
garbage,"Pacific Rim is a movie for people who get distracted by shiny objects.There is no plot, no suspense, no drama, no humour, no attempt at characterisation . All there is, is a big pile of CGI and a script that looks like it was written by a four year old.There is LOTS of cgi. Its not very good CGI and it completely fails to disguise the fact that the movie is idiotic and lazy, with nothing to offer anyone except the completely undiscerning viewer. The film even has much of the action taking place in poorly lit environments to attempt to describe the lameness of the effects.The actors do their best, but even Idris Elba, whose work I normally enjoy, is completely wasted in this trash.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Something Slightly Different,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect after watching the trailer for pacific rim. Was this another transformers? Godzilla MK2? Well, it was actually a pleasant surprise in many many ways.Narrative: Nothing to fault here. The story line is solid and cuts strait to what's important instead of burying us in years of back-story and needless contextual rubbish. Its a pretty strait forward affair with not may surprises it must be said, but the beauty really does lie in the simplicity with which the story is both crafted and told.Effects: This is my only gripe. I predominately wanted to see this film for the effects, and don't get me wrong they are utterly beautiful at times, but stylistically, its like someone has taken cyberpunk, steam punk, a little bit of blade runner, star wars and some minority report, scattered all that on a table and picked little bits blindfolded to recycle. There are moments of utter utter genius in the concept design that I think we will see cropping up in many a sci-fi from now on, but as a whole, it has no governing style which visually, i found both confusing and a little annoying...Cast and characters: Not much to say here really. There's not going to be any Oscar nominations but neither are there any terrible scenes. At times some of the main characters feel a little wooden and under-developed, but in a film predominately based on action, its not a huge issue and anything it lacks it soon makes up for elsewhere.Conclusion: Its worth your money at the cinema, and judging by the press not many have been parting with hard earned cash to see this, which is a real shame. This film has some real intelligence to it which I think earns it a viewing and better press. Imagine everything you hated about transformers, well this is an antidote. From start to finish it is very entertaining and deals with a disaster scenario in a very refreshing manner. If you going to watch anything besides Elysium, I would suggest this. I've given it seven stars, but if this turns out to be the classic it very well could be, I'd imagine most will be giving it 8.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great movie for robots vs monsters anime fans,"I just watched Pacific Rim on the first day/time slot of premiere in 3D. Yes, I am a geek. But that is not the whole point. If you had the excitement of watching anime movies of robots vs monsters in childhood, this is perfect movie for you. The Kaiju monsters design reminds me of Godzilla's villain monsters combined with Cloverfield monster, xenomorph (Aliens), and TRON. As for the Jeager robots, I'll let you to decide whether they are good or very good. :)To watch this movie I needed to change my mindset to be like a 10 ten year old robot geek child, like 29 years ago. Because if not, you will feel a lot of question marks and disappointment through this movie. The story is quite predictable. The plot and pace are simple enough for children to understand. And the nerd and geek professor appearances are a bit annoying for me. But hey, that what is all about: to celebrate the childhood memory of robots vs monsters.Overall, the movie is great for robot vs monsters anime fans. It's not even close to that horrible Michael Bay's Transformers.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Beyond a Mindless Action Movie,"'Pacific Rim' looked to me like a mindless action movie in the trailer. I thought I was going to the theater to seeing two hours and eleven minutes of giant robots piloted by humans fighting giant aliens. Just about the first hour of this movie makes it more than a mindless action movie. This movie focused on the backgrounds of characters for a while and used character development to make us care about them more. That worked for some of the characters.The acting in this movie as about average. Some of the performances were better than others. Some aspects of actors' performances were better than others. Charlie Hunnam was more of a lower quality performance. In some parts of the movie, I wasn't convinced he was really Raleigh Becket (his character in the movie), because he wouldn't say some of the dialog with feeling. It was like he was just reading lines some of the time. He had a bit of a British accent in the movie, but it seemed like it was only in affect in a small number of scenes in the movie. I don't think that anyone has a British accent in only a few parts of their life, so that makes it a bad thing. That bring up another performance: Idris Elba's. He had a better British accent than Hunnam, but it still only seemed to be in affect some of the time. Also, his acting performance was good, but he wasn't able to put enough stress on words at times. When Stacker Pentecost (his character) was supposed to put deep feeling into his words, Idris Elba wouldn't be able to put enough feeling into the words. Other than those things, his performance was fine, though. Rinko Kikuchi, who played Mako Mori, had the best performance out of the all of the actors I can think of. She didn't have any accent problems, she was able to put enough stress on words, and I was convinced she was Mako Mori. Her performance was good.I couldn't find any problems with the writing in this movie. I didn't look for any problems in the writing, but it seemed realistic. In some parts, it seemed it little far fetched, though.The CGI in this movie was great. It really didn't seem like nothing was there. All of the images blended in with the aspects of the scene. When there was almost nothing but CGI, it seemed like they (the images) were real. The only time I would really tell if there was CGI (if I didn't already know) if it was compared to an actual image.Now, for the things I went to the movie to see: the action sequences. The action sequences were just CGI's fighting each other. I thought the sequences were great. They were very exciting and exhilarating. The sequences also didn't happen as much as I thought they would, but more would've been less, I think. It might have been like 'Man of Steel', where the action took a long time to get old. Here, the sequences never got old and they stayed exciting. The action was even better than I thought it was going to be in this movie. There's a clear reason for almost everything which causes less thinking during the scenes. Several points to the film for the acting sequences and events.About the first forty five minutes of this movie after the title came up were character background and development. It did introduce characters and tell their purpose in the story, too. It was interesting at first, but it got old after a while. There was some drama, but it was just slow. I don't know why this movie wanted to be slow in the beginning. Some action movies have been slow in the beginning, but it just didn't work in this one. For the mood of this movie, the logical thing wouldn't be to be slow in the beginning. Being like this almost only takes points away from the movie. Knowing so much about the characters did imply different tones of the movie later on when things would reflect on the character's past. The slowness of the beginning of the movie didn't only consist of character background buildup. Only about half of it consisted of that.'Pacific Rim' has great images and scenery, barely-below-average acting, average writing, amazing acting sequences, very deep characters, and is well done, but has some bad performances and some boring parts. It was very exciting, had explainable events and aspects, and had a good story. I very much recommend this movie and might buy this movie on DVD when it comes out. My 8/10 rating means 'Pacific Rim' is really good.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

What did you expect?,"Overall a good watch, switch off brain and get the pop corn and the beers in. This is a typical American 'we can save the world don't worry' action film. And yes the effects are spectacular and yes it is 'Godzilla fighting Transformers' so should be every kid born before the 1990s dream film. if you like that sort of thing fill your boots. However there are a few minor niggles that confused me a little, such as why do they stop building these giant machines and then build a wall? You have just seen these alien monsters walk through several very large steel buildings without breaking stride and then someone says lets build a wall to stop them, no weapons are added to this wall its just a big wall..... That seems very stupid if you ask me and I am proved correct when a wall is breached within 2 minutes. Also where do they get all this steel, titanium etc from? And why do the heads of the machines have to drop onto the body in such a spectacular way......",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A movie made for the big screen,"Before I throw my opinion, I just want to say that I was excited for this movie. I'm a huge fan of the anime series Gundam Wing & Big O, so the robots versus aliens had me hooked. I really did enjoy this movie.I think people didn't give the story aspect enough credit. I thought the setup in the beginning set the stage for the story, and the main plot, though predictable at points, kept the movie from being more than just a CGI fight fest. Charlie Hunnam did a good job as the lead, but I thought Idris Elba & Rinko Kikucho did fantastic. Charlie Day & Burn Gorman, as scientist working with the main cast, did a good job with the comic relief and Ron Perlman was still good as his role as a black market merchant. Major kudos to child actress Mana Ashida, who played a younger version of Rinko Kikucho's character in a flashback sequence, as she was amazing.The real treat was the action packed battles with the robots (called Jaegers) and the monsters (called Kaijus). This was the kind of movie that needed to be experienced on the big screen and it didn't disappoint. Could I recommend this to anyone....probably not. But if you are a fan of Godzilla type monster movies or mobile suit anime shows mentioned above, I think you will enjoy this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Whilst overambitious, trying to fit a mammoth plot into only two hours, Pacific Rim still delivers.","I was so excited to finally see Pacific Rim. An ambitious idea, carried with big-budget effects, brought to you by master director Guillermo del Toro. I was pumped. I was hoping for brilliance, something to truly give other blockbusters a run for their money. The result, as I had to expect, was not that of a game changing event. Instead, it was more or less, directly in between Greatness and Disappointment. There's a lot to love about Pacific Rim, but where it suffers seems to be mostly through a lack of confidence in it's own premise.Like last years Les Miserables, Rim makes the unfortunate error of trying to fit in 3-4 hours worth of storytelling into just over 2. Which is unfortunate considering Pacific Rim's all round story is it's strongest element. Though taken from many sources, (and by no means, anything that original) it shapes a very well-throughout premise with detail and conviction. In it's execution of this however, is where the film stumbles. Mainly, the plot feels rushed. Condensing years of devastation and development, into one short montage (the first five minutes of the film covers the entire ark which Pacific Rim is built on: the first encounters of the Kaiju, the initial attempts to stop them and finally, the culmination of the Jaguar program) which contains enough story to fill an entire other movie. The intro then concludes with the untimely destruction of one of, what seemed to be, the human race's final salvation. From there is where the movie actually begins.Now while that's an interesting (somewhat ballsy) approach, this structure causes Rim to feel much smaller in scope than what it actually is. This story is HUGE as a concept and it should have translated that way. Unfortunately what is shown is both giant in scale and unjustly short. The film is set over a small amount of time, considering the attacks have been going on for years and though it covers many key events in the Kaiju war, it never really feels like you've been delivered the full picture.Now, on the positive side, if you focus your attention to what is on display, Pacific Rim excels. It flows with both confidence and conviction. Expecting a lot from the maker of Pan's Labyrinth and Hellboy 2, del Toro delivers with a lot of what made him great (even if you're mostly getting del Toro, the action director). The design of both Jeagar and Kaiju are brutal and majestic. The world in which Rim exists is one where any previous del Toro film could fit in with comfortably. Beautiful design. As well as that, being this is del Toro's first real entry into mega blockbuster territory (Hellboy 2 was big, but nothing close to this) there was initial concerns that maybe he would be out of his depths in bringing the all-out-brawls to the big screen. Luckily, he delivers there too.The Jaguar vs. Kaiju assaults are stellar, even if they're not the defining assault on your senses you were hoping for. When the standoffs begin, you are returned to your childhood, reminded of why you loved seeing things go bomb in the first place. It's big, it's exciting, it's unpredictable (well, some what) and it's just so must fun. Delivered, also, with a sense of peril for the characters, which is arguably the most important thing when creating great action. Which, for that, requires a group of characters to which you need to feel like giving a damn about.Though things have been said about the people of Rim, I found them to be well-rounded and developed. Though not reaching the arks of previous big-screen franchises (The Avengers, The Dark Knight), everyone is given enough to go with, to at least earn the right for us to care about them. The standout being Mako Mori played by Rinko Kikuchi who holds the stand-out scene of the movie, when she first steps foot inside the cockpit and co-pilots the Gypsy Danger...While on the other side of the hemisphere, Charlie Hunnam, taking leading position, brings the usual tough guy, stands-for-everything-right solider, with a delicacy that makes it feel more realistic than movie realistic. Supporting casts deliver also, with the always great Idris Elba doing well with a small role, while Charlie Day is much less annoying than what you may have previously anticipated and is convincing as the fumbling, genius scientist. And of course the always fun to watch Ron Perlman as shady, black market dealer Hannibal Chau.If you take Pacific Rim as a great action/adventure story you will find much to appreciate in it's delivery. Though, were it to have the self-confidence to deliver it's premise with more conviction and pacing, it could have been the best action film of the year. For what is on display however, there is very little to hate. Guillermo del Toro has done an exceptional job at bringing this mammoth concept to the big screen and delivering in, close to the way I had hoped. In the end, what you're left with is a great, thrilling experience that confirms that big robots fighting big monsters is actually a great idea for a movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Digi-geeks wet day dream,"Pacific Rim takes summer block buster movie to it's new level. After a short and vigorous beginning the movie grows bigger than ever seen digital effect rumble. With the length of over two hours the movie is simply eye candy. Guillermo Del Toro holds the story just enough interesting that you can handle all that effect rumble. When all the Transformer movies are just empty digital effect after digital effect Guillermo Del Toro's apocalyptic world is just enough interesting to keep it watchable. Too bad that the story here is so cheesy and it has told so many times in so many different ways. But anyway this turbo loaded effect rumble is quite beautiful to watch. Many times you can see almost see a raindrop to fall from the neck metallic monster. 3D looks great even it hasn't use in every way it could have used. Movie is typical popcorn movie but the trouble here is that it can be too much to most of the viewers. You have to be geek enough to like it. For me there is no trouble to like it and it really is worth of movie ticket price. This movie is a digi-geeks wet daydream, but if you want a good story instead of effect rumble you better to avoid this movie.***1/2",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Larger Than Life,"Pacific Rim takes inspiration from the elements of any material that involves giant creatures and robots. It shows a simple concept about piloted robots, Jaegers, fighting against sea aliens, Kaijus. This idea alone would already make a fantastic blockbuster. The surprise we get is it features more than just endless explosions. There are plenty of innovations to root for which it can almost be a new popular classic. The only less intriguing parts however are the clichés that are too known in many big sci-fi action movies. Despite of that, it kept the promise of being gigantically awesome. It's not completely groundbreaking, but it's still quite an experience.Aside from the large scale battles, the film amazingly creates an innovating futuristic alternate universe. It tells the origins of the Kaijus and how the Jaegers work, shows what society and the media have become, and throw some satires of the genre. The exploration of the vision is so absorbing, it feels like you went to it as a trip. But what somewhat halts this from being larger than life is when it takes the generic elements of any typical blockbuster, like the hero's motivations, the main robot is somehow an underdog in one scene, there's an arrogant team member, sacrifices, and so on. It's hard to not notice them since they are the central points of the story. The intriguing stuff about the Jaegers and Kaijus still took over the experience. At least it embraces its own fantasy tastes without being ""dark"" and emo like today's blockbuster trend.Charlie Hunnam's performance is fitting to a graphic novel based movie, which is kind of appropriate as his role. In the battle scenes, he gives genuine human emotions as he punches and fall. Idris Elba remarkably brings heart to the picture while being awesome at the same time. Rinko Kikuchi makes her character more than just a partner of Raleigh. Charlie Day and Burn Gorman delightfully serves more energy to the story, while Ron Perlman appears in a short screen time but satisfying enough.Now the real highlight of the picture, the visuals are overall shiny and snazzy. The designs of the creatures and robots are palpably marvelous. As the special effects move these heavy giants, the action did something better than just blowing up stuff. Although explosions and loud noises are not actually flaws(It's about giant robots, c'mon!), but a real good set piece needs a decent and genuine fortitude. In the midst of the noises, you will always get the sense of danger to the Jaegers, mostly because there are human pilots beneath the ravaging machines. It effectively made those sequences electrifying and the monsters terrifying than you would expect.Pacific Rim will have its own fans. It feels like a self-indulged blockbuster that people will end up loving. Besides, this film is said to be Guillermo del Toro's dream come true coming from his childhood. And seeing all that, there's plenty of things to explore and to be intrigued. If only the plot can break some points from the mainstream storytelling, it would have been less predictable and much extraordinary. But physically, it is extraordinary. It's both big and eye candy which is the snazziest merit you will see. Also in the action scenes where it's more into the thrills than the fireworks, because it's all about iron fists hitting on monsters' face. Again, the story may be familiar, but the setting and the action keeps everything looks fresh and amazing.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Waste of money & time,"Took a chance on this actually stupid movie whereby you would have to be stupid to believe any of it.The premise that if you build a giant robot to fight a giant monster and then punch the monster like it was a title bout is ridiculous, and an insult to your mind set. why spend billions to build these robots only to fire cannons at them from close range. the thought that you would power this giant robot with the thoughts of two separates minds is staggering.I found it to not be worth a tenth of the money spent to see the hype. I would call it ""Godzilla vs Transformers "" for a Saturday morning kid show . but to cough up $50.00 for 2 adults and 2 kids to see this movie,is just not worth it.My opinion was not the only, my wife and kids hated it too.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Best movie of the summer,"This movie is one of the best I have seen in a long time. Everything I can think of is incredible in this movie. From the incredible CGI effects to even the awesome soundtrack this movie does no wrong. The only negative thing about the movie is the length, but with the amount of information and depth they put into the movie, one is amazed by how short the movie is compared to what it could be. Not once did I look at my watch and think ""When will this be over?"", like I do with most movies over 2 hours long. The fight scenes are very well done in this movie. You expect a fight scene between a 250 foot robot and a 300 foot monster to be cheesy and in your face but they aren't. All of the technology is explained very well and the camera angles are ones that allow you to see everything going on. I highly recommend that everyone on this site go see this movie now.

Now that's good entertainment.,"I'll keep it short because i just stepped out of the theater and i want to jot down my thoughts quickly. I loved almost everything about this movie. The acting was good, the CGI was incredible as was the scale of the Jaegars and Kaiju and the fight scenes were extraordinary, I loved the director's decision to start the movie in the middle of the war rather than the beginning, the script was good. The film does a great way of explaining important things, such as why the Jaegers need two pilots or why the Kaiju attack in the first place. I think my favorite part is the two scientists. However, there were one or two subplots that seemed clichéd such as the relationship between Mako and the lead guy whose name escapes me. It seems almost reminiscent of a buddy cop drama/comedy. That being said, it's executed very well and the chemistry of the two is wonderful. The music was exhilarating but really that's all it does, as far as i can tell it just seems to be generic electronic action music. Entertaining, but not really something that stands out.All in all, an excellent movie from Guillermo Del Toro. Think of it as Transformer's more intelligent brother.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I just wanted to get out of the theater and salvage what was left of my day.I yearn for a return to some truly excellent science fiction. This isn't it. We seem to be stuck in a rut where impractical machines with as many moving parts as you can possibly render aim to keep our minds distracted rather than engaged and immersed as science fiction should be.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pacific Rim Christmas came early....,"How do you make the perfect summer movie? I'm not just talking about the best action movie, or the best summer comedy, just the perfect summer movie. Some would say lots of explosions, while others may say a good love story will always do the trick. Every year all the studios aim to release a movie that you will want to see, their idea of that great summer movie. Well I think Guillermo del Toro has figured it out, Robots Vs. Monsters.I know it can't be that simple, since we already had a Cowboys and Aliens that didn't live up to expectations, but for me ""Pacific Rim"" really is. We have always looked to the stars for where we thought visitors might arrive on our planet one day. But, what if they come from deep within our oceans? That is the question ""Pacific Rim"" poses. Creatures called ""Kaiju"" have attacked the coastal cities in the Pacific. They start in San Francisco, and then attack cities like Manila, and Cabo. After conventional weapons have little effect, the world's governments decide the only way to fight monsters, is to build monsters of their own. The ""Jaeger Program"" is born, where giant robots are built to fight for mankind. Each Jaeger is controlled by two pilots, who control each hemisphere in the Jaeger. The Jaegers become mankind's best weapon against the ""Kaiju"" and their only way to save the planet.This is what ""Transformers"" could have been, if del Toro had been at the helm instead of Michael Bay. While Bay has always been a visual director, he just does not have the complete package like del Toro. This movie has something for everyone, but above all it is just fun to watch. It is a big and loud, and one of those movies that are made to be seen on the biggest screen you can find. For everything that is wrong with summer movies like ""After Earth"" and ""The Lone Ranger"" this movie gets it right. This is not a movie that is going to get praised for its great story, even though it has a decent one. The main selling point is ""come see this movie and you get to see giant robots and monsters beat the crap out of each other."" I mean really after that what more do you need? I went in expecting to see one of the best movies of the summer and walked out not thinking any different. The performances for the most part are not anything special, except for every time Idris Elba is on the screen. Given the best dialogue, including a speech any football coach would love, Elba just commands your attention. In a world where sequels rule, we should embrace originally. I mean didn't we say all we needed to say with the original ""Grown Ups""? Do we really need another? I say this weekend when you go to the movies see ""Pacific Rim"". It's like sequels are the ""Kaiju"" and this is your chance to command a Jaeger and to tell the world you are tired of all the ""Kaiju"". And if you can, see it 'IMAX' big, because this movie doesn't do anything small.Brian Taylorhttp://the2cinemen.blogspot.com/",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
(not) Hit & Sunk,"I was surprised that this movie didn't do well at the Box Office. Not only because it is done by Del Toro, but mainly because it is really good. And it seems people like it generally too (see rating here on IMDb, currently ranking at 7.6). So why didn't it perform? Tough to say, but seems like people didn't want to watch it at that time, so maybe the release date was off.You can't tell with those things though, so I'm pretty sure this will do much better once it hits the video stores/markets and sells/rents like crazy. The movie deserves that. And not because it is a great movie, but because it is very entertaining. Predictable and filled with clichés, Idris Elbas performance alone is worth the money!

It's far from perfect but the action makes it a pretty enjoyable blockbuster,"I've grown tired of summer blockbusters. I love action movies but with all the Transformer movies, comic book adaptations, among others things, it gets a bit much after a while. Pacific Rim is typically overlong but I can't deny how enjoyable it is. The middle is a bit slow at times. I thought it got a bit too talky at times, and my interest began to wane. I did love the final 40/50 minutes. The final 40/50 minutes is absolutely packed with non-stop carnage and destruction. It's loaded with CGI; don't get me wrong, it just didn't bother me. The production design is extremely impressive, and it's amazing visually. The destruction on the cities, the robots, the monsters all looked fantastic. My only problem as I explained above is that when you aren't being amazed by all of that stuff, it does tend to be a little mundane at certain points, but it has a lot more good than bad. The performances can be a little bland at times. Charlie Hunnam isn't the most exciting lead. He's OK at best. I never really got into his emotional plight. Since the movie is over two hours long, he didn't have nearly enough charisma to maintain my interest. Thankfully, the fantastic action tends to bail him out a lot of the time, but I wasn't all that impressed by him. Idris Elba is excellent as per usual. He's by far the most interesting character in this movie. His gruff, yet caring character was a blast to watch. Rinko Kikuchi is rather uninteresting as Mako. She has moments where she does good work. I just think she seemed a little uncomfortable during some of the meatier moments. Charlie Day is alternately funny and annoying as a scientist.Final Thoughts: Aside from the mediocre performances, the rather boring middle section, I thought this was well above average for a blockbuster movie. It sets out to entertain the masses. It does that extremely well. Considering I had low expectations going in, I was pleasantly surprised. It's a little overlong but if you kick your brain to the curb, sit back, relax, and enjoy the abundance of destruction7.6/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Just a 10 year old boy's sugar rush.,"As Marvin the Paranoid Android might say ""I saw it. It was AWFUL"".Nothing about this mess hangs together.

CRASH! Wham! Etc.There is not a single cliché-free relationship in this film and, if the robots are made of steel, the characters are made of cardboard. In fact. the Jaegers have more personality than the actors, which isn't saying much, and the whole experience is like a huge sugar and popcorn rush in a kiddies matinée.I can't believe this cynical pile of Kaiju excrement came from the director of PAN'S LABYRINTH or the HELLBOY films.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Worth the wait, time and money...Brilliant!","I have been following this movie for a while now. Largely because of the two main actors Charlie Hunnam and Idris Elba and I have to say I was not disappointed at all.

It was a visual feast.Action was on point. The story flowed well (this is a blockbuster after all, we aren't going to compare it to an art house film). For me the actors embraced their roles very well and the visuals were magnificent (thank god once again for the 3D). Everything just felt right!Being familiar with Guillermo's past work I would say this is his best yet. His imagination is wicked. So if you are looking for great entertainment and a little something to wow you, this is the movie for you.Bravo. Two thumbs up.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Turn off your brain and enjoy,"The premise of this movie makes absolutely no sense but in this case it is not as big of a problem as it sounds. Watching giant monsters and robots duke it out in the coolest possible way to the great soundtrack by Ramin Djawadi is just tons of fun. And while this movie certainly banks heavily on great special effects, the characters aren't that bad either and the director did take his time for those quiet, emotional moments. In addition the world building is surprisingly rich for this kind of film.All in all Pacific Rim is put together so well that it almost makes you forget how stupid it is but not quite. And this is what is ultimately holding it back from true greatness.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great Throwback to Giant Monster Films,"Pacific Rim (2013)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Guillermo del Toro's latest is a grand throwback to the days when Godzilla and other large monsters stalked the screens. Set in the future, the Earth comes under attack by giant sea monsters so they create giant robots controlled by two pilots so that they can be destroyed. It doesn't take long for the monsters to recapture the upper hand and as time on Earth is running out the humans must come up with a new plan of attack. PACIFIC RIM isn't a masterpiece but it's about as good as a film like this can get. While there are a couple flaws to be found along the way, there's still no way to deny that this here is pure entertainment from start to finish. Obviously del Toro knows his genre so fans will see all sorts of winks to earlier movies but the director takes it to the next level and really delivers something that is a lot of fun and full of wonderful action. I'm one who usually speaks against CGI not because of the technique but because so many directors don't know how to properly use it. That's certainly not the case here because the monsters, the robots and the broken down and destroyed cities all look real. This here is very important because it allows one to really connect with everything that's going on on the screen. Another major plus here is that the action scenes are full of wonderful imagination. The battle sequences are usually long, very destructive and oh so much fun and this includes a rather amazing sequence at the end that's underwater. The performances are also quite good with Charlie Hunnam, Diego Klattenhoff and especially Idris Elba all fitting their roles nicely. Ron Perlman also has a nice supporting bit. As I said, I think there were a couple flaws with one being the running time, which I felt was a bit too long as ten or fifteen-minutes off would have helped things. There were also a few too many shots that were extremely close to the action to the point where you can't get the full view of all the destruction going on. Still, PACIFIC RIM is a great throwback to the early monster films and it's fun from the word go.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Plot holes, but otherwise it's 2hrs of sci-fi eye-candy","Why on earth would you go from being a top-tier pilot for the military, to being a construction worker? That just makes no sense... I know that they did it so that the character that Charlie Hunnam plays would seem like an 'everyman's man', but it simply doesn't make sense.Another thing that doesn't make sense: Why are all the Jaegers (robots) melee? That makes very little sense in reality... why engage with melee Kaiju (monsters) in melee? Why not just build Jaegers that have a crap tonne of missiles and lazer weapons, and blast the Kaiju into another dimension from far away? I know the movie would be drastically different if that were the case, but it would also be much cooler imo, because everyone knows big guns are better than big swords. I just think it's a huge plot hole.But other than the gaping plot-holes that this movie has, the movie is a 2hr trip filled with good CGI and a tonne of sci-fi and action fans will love it. For once though, I'd like to see the main actor+actress NOT end up kissing... it's a completely played-out trope that needs to be put on ice for a few years, honestly.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pleasantly Surprising,"As a war between humankind and monstrous sea creatures wages on, a former pilot and a trainee are paired up to drive a seemingly obsolete special weapon in a desperate effort to save the world from the apocalypse.I resisted seeing this film for a while... I was under the impression it was going to be a lot of CGI robots and monsters bashing each other, which I really have no interest in. There is still some of that, but director Guillermo Del Toro made sure that things went a bit deeper than that, with some decent human characters.Really, the casting is to be praised. Del Toro regular Ron Perlman plays one of his best characters yet, and the choice of Charlie Day as a scientist was brilliant. I wasn't sure if he'd be the right sort of person for the story, but he was beyond perfect... that Charlie humor we love, with just a twinge of madness.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Cgi-tastic!,"The thing about a movie like this is, we all want to see the big robots fight the big monsters. Simple as that. The downside is, you have to suffer all the boring drama bits between the action to get there.I've never understood why it is so many directors feel they have to have some tedious love interest in action flicks, it just totally takes the edge of the tension. Then we have the really nerdy and half crazy scientist types who, while portrayed as seemingly brilliant in their field, come across as almost insane. Has anyone ever seen a scientist behave like this? I mean in the real world? Nope, me neither, but it seems movieland feels that's how we should see them all. It's bloody irritating if you ask me. And Pacific Rim has its very own who really bugged me while on screen. Please can we have some normal scientists in these kind of movies please? Although given the plots are so outrageous maybe that just wouldn't work so well.Anyway, getting to the action. It's good. It's really good, although sometimes it's a little hard to make out what's going on during the close-up fighting. Among horror fans, CGI is hated, as we love the day's of olde with lashings of fake blood and latex, but without the runaway developments of CGI it would be impossible to make a film like this. I reckon Pacific Rim is the ultimate demonstration of the top end of where we are right now in computer based effects. What you see on screen is truly stunning, moreso the big manmade battle machines than the monsters I must say.I enjoyed the movie a lot. It's maybe a little over-long with those slow drama scenes, but the onslaught of the mega battles certainly makes up for that. Good stuff then, for something so big and hollywoodesque.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A pile of pants, but fun.","Having been told I had to go and see the new one I thought I'd better catch up on the original, to know what is going on at least. Having watched it that clarity isn't exactly clear, as I didn't know what was going on. If I'm honest I didn't care much, as plot wasn't exactly the focus, it certainly was action packed, didn't drag, and very much started off as it continued.It's of course intensely over the top, I expected the man made robots to be high fiving and woop wooing as they took down the monsters, what do you expect?Some fun performances, some dodgy ones, I'll let you decide on which is which. Luther himself looked totally out of place, in a role he obviously did for the cash, Elba did nothing here to enhance his acting credibility, but his charisma is obvious.Like I say it's a pile of pants, it's uber trashy, but somehow it's an exciting sci fi romp. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Outstanding,"I was drawn to this film with a bit of apprehension, based on the trailers and the thought of sitting through one more predictable Hollywood summer sci-fi blockbuster. It was Guillermo del Toro's previous work that got me over the threshold (Cronos, Pan's Labyrinth). What I got was a feast for the eyes and ears that draws from inspiration from virtually every popular international genre, from Hong Kong martial arts movies to Gothic horror and Japanese Anime and then adds the unique sensibilities of a director with a unique vision who knows how to bring it across in a BIG way. He knows how to stretch our credibility beyond the limits and make it work using a great cast of character actors adding to the strong chemistry between his three leads, Hunnam, Elba and Rinko Kikuchi (in a very strong performance).Remember all those Japanese monster pictures where huge beasts come out of the sea and smash up Tokyo? Remember ""Cloverfield?"" (this movie explains that one) Roll all of these up with today's effects and Guillermo del Toro's weird design sensibility and then tell yourself, ""Let's take this one TOTALLY over the top"" and you've got ""Pacific Rim."" As an action flick, from the first shot it never stops or even slows down. The scenes with the little girl in Hong Kong (i think) are particularly chilling and uniquely part of del Toro's signature - (he understands children and terror). This film makes ""The Avengers"" look sedate.Besides being an extremely entertaining, good old fashioned monster flick, ""Pacific Rim"" is a tribute to the strength of international cinema, involving artists and production teams from every part of the globe. I imagine this will be a HUGE international hit.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Disappointment,"It has a good score here on IMDb, but again it proved to be highly overrated. I gave it a 5 because it would have been much better, and contains no serious logical mistakes. It looks like the creators wanted some easy money, so they mixed everything together: robots, some fightings, aliens, etc... But. The story is poorly written, and basically follows a well known, and unbelievingly boring, and predictable path. No surprises at all. It's like nowadays no one really cares to write a good and exciting story, they concentrate only on the CGI effects, and they think the rest is not important. They copy-paste it from other movies and that's it. Apparently it looks working, sadly...",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Derivative schlock,"Pacific Rim is an exercise in unoriginality. By the end, I desperately hoped that the filmmakers had intended some cynical meta-theme about the poor state of Hollywood films today, but I gave up hope upon reading the pretentious boasts by Del Toro and his cronies who apparently took this boring popcorn flick dead seriously.The plot is paper thin and not very interesting, mainly because the film is too scared to go anywhere remotely clever or deep with its characters, message or general story. Del Toro has said the message is meant to be the simple ""we all should work together."" Even though this statement is cheesy and borderline meaningless, it could theoretically work with enough wit & creativity. Instead, all the characters are annoying stereotypes, and the film's ""message"" is conveyed in the laziest way possible. Most of the so-called ""character arcs"" are basically ""2 characters fight like whiny teens, eventually 1 of them does something helpful or useful, the other guy immediately pulls a 180 and decides they're friends.""I couldn't stand the 1-dimensional, boring characters. Even the central protagonist we spend the most time with never amounts to anything more than an annoyingly smug, whitebread hero whose ""generic action hero"" screaming voice will have you rolling your eyes throughout the 2nd half of the film. The female lead is so flat and bland that she constantly waffles between the extremes of an ""impressive talented spunky chick"" stereotype or an ""unreliable weak woman"" stereotype. Whatever the case, the filmmakers clearly thought audiences were too stupid to understand any characters who act like nuanced, 3-dimensional human beings. The lack of any worthwhile story, message or characters is a huge insult to the audience up-front.Without a decent story or characters, what else is there? The special effects are widely praised, but every time the monsters or robots were on screen, I was acutely aware I was watching a special effect. The big CGI fights are trite and predictable with no distinct personality; they're the kind of thing Hollywood has done countless times before and will bore you to tears if you're older than 12. It feels as if the effects crew made a generic CGI effects showcase and the rest of the film was written around those hackneyed action scenes!Even the soundtrack is typical & unoriginal. Most of the time you don't notice it there, but in the ""dramatic"" moments you might notice the incredibly cheesy and corny ""scary"" or ""triumphant"" cues, again completely bland and generic.There are so many elements that serve NO purpose in this movie other than to be as derivative and unoriginal as possible. For instance, the pilots feel pain when their robot gets hit. Why? This adds nothing to the plot or message, but Evangelion did it so Pacific Rim needs to steal the idea. The computer voice is distractingly Glados from the Portal video games. Why? There's no clever reason or hidden meaning; it just adds to the vibe that this film is a patchwork of borrowed ideas for one meaningless mishmash. You could no doubt write a shot-by-shot analysis of all the influences and sources this flick rips off, and I'm sure that all the original sources this film steals from would be way more entertaining and worth your while than this bloated pastiche.I won't even bother touching on the glaring plot holes and inconsistencies. The internet already has a LOT of material about the ludicrous flaws that pepper the film's already flimsy script. Personally I could forgive the countless illogical concepts surrounding the plot if it were a story worth telling, but Pacific Rim never even comes close.If you want a film with any respect for its audience, skip Pacific Rim. This film seeks only to make easy cash by giving people the same things they've seen before, except without any cleverness or depth that might make them interesting.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Tarantino, take note: I you're going to pay homage to old film genres, do it right.","Pacific Rim is largely an action epic, and a good one at that. The narrative itself is based on Japanese monster (kaiju) films, and - while paying homage to the classic 'style' - manages to be very modern and fairly grounded in reality. Pacing is good and the story has a set of well-placed twists, accompanied by some interesting character development. The casting, on the other hand, is not great, but does not detract from the experience.In contrast, the direction is fantastic. Guillermo del Toro does a great job of making the large and scary feel huge and terrifying, without making a mess on-screen. Several great touches add to the 'epic' feel of the film, such as the detail on the hide of the kaiju and the fantastic sound effects. Coupled with a great musical score, this film would be one of the best this year. Sadly, there is a small problem that stops this film being fantastic, but great instead: the scientist sub-plot.Two scientists are in the process of finding a new way to stop the kaiju, and they manage to be fairly useless and rather annoying. They have a fair number of cheesy lines, which left me wishing that their sub-plot had been left out of the film. Nevertheless, Pacific Rim is still very good, and definitely worth watching.

What Transformers Should Have Been,"Rating: 4/5 stars Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Not since ""Jurassic Park"" have I had the utmost pleasure of witnessing such a great monster sci-fi mash-up. Like ""Jurassic Park"", ""Them"", ""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms"", and other classics of the genre, ""Pacific Rim"" too intersperses the plot and back-story succinctly well as the action unfolds. The characters and their journey are given adequate footage as the monsters v/s robots action. More importantly, as the action unfolds, every single shot, each and every sequence is beautifully captured like a ballet reaching its crescendo.Unlike most gigantic FX laden pseudo sci-fi blockbusters like the ""Transformers"" franchise and ""Iron Man 3"", this films pays immense detail to certain laws of physics and plain simple logic. The action unfolds in a grand spectacle and straps you in for a roller-coaster ride. But it also pays respect to your senses and enables you to minutely follow each aspect of how the fight scenes are choreographed. Wish all gargantuan CGI driven films were like this.The film stays true to classic monster movies and also to its anime roots. Fans of both, anime and monster movies will be able to detect many subtle references to past classics and popular culture. In the end, ""Pacific Rim"" is summer blockbuster entertainment at its best and you'll be craving for a second viewing once the experience soaks in.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Robots and Monsters....OH MY!,"One of summer's most anticipated movies is finally here, Del toro's Pacific Rim. This is a movie little boys imagine when they are young, playing in their sandbox. It's quite easy to see why Del Toro was attracted to such a film. It clearly shows in this film and I don't think many directors could handle a film such as this with such love and dedication to their craft. Del Toro really knows what audiences want. So is Pacific Rim his best film? No defiantly not, not even close. Is it at least a great film? No it's not. Pacific Rim however is entertainment at it's finest. It's difficult for me to rate a film like this . Pacific Rim has flaws. The human characters are pretty much awful, and the movie is cheesy as hell. I must also say 3 characters in this movie were probably some of the worst characters I have ever seen in a film. The main female, and the two scientists were just awful. However the real star of this film is the giant robots and the evil monsters. Del Toro knows how to entertain an audience and by god does he do it here. The action is fantastic and does not get to crazy like some Transformers movies do. This is the type of movie where you need to have your brain off and just be entertained. If you hate movies like this, then don't even bother checking this out, but if you have watched similar films and enjoyed them, then you will be all over this. Pacific Rim manages to be original and familiar at the same time. However because of Del Toro's fantastic direction and storytelling it's easy to overlook Pacific Rim's failures. This one redeems the mediocre summer films. Rating: on a film reviewers scale i would say 7.5 out of 10. However it's Del Toro i'm biased and above all rounding up to a solid 8 out of 10. Final Rating: 8 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Furious Excellence.,"""Pacific Rim"", directed by Guillermo del Toro, is a science fiction film that takes a long dormant genre, the Japanese Kaiju monster films of the 1950s and 1960s. They featured such creatures as Godzilla and a variety of others, del Toro not so much reinventing it but bringing it right back up to date. George Lucas' special effects company, Industrial Light & Magic, has created a world that is in the near-future but feels like tomorrow, the textures of the both the giant ""jaegers"" and monsters so realistic that even without 3D, you can feel that you can even touch them. The effects are simply put, outstanding and so far the best this year.Yet del Toro, who directed the acclaimed Oscar-winning ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and the pair of ""Hellboy"" films, and his scriptwriter Travis Beacham, know that for the film to be more than merely ""mecha vs. monsters"", real characters need to be created and invested with real emotions. In interviews, del Toro said ""We cannot pretend this is Ibsen"", so the characters like Becket, Pentecost and Mori are strongly defined people who, through the equally powerful performances from Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba and Rinko Kikunchi give us a film where we care what happens and mean the final climactic sacrifices are actually poignant, as opposed to manufactured drama with little thought behind it.Charlie Day and Burn Gorman, who play a pair of bantering scientists along with Ron Perlman, who is a black marketer in Hong Kong dealing in kaiju organs, are vividly sketched supporting characters who provide an antidote to the seriousness of the main plot. The humour isn't cynical or used to self-consciously comment on the film, but instead springs naturally from the characters. For a film with such a potentially risible concept and execution, it's a pleasant surprise to discover it to be so well written.The art direction and design of the mechs and monsters is superb, as is the envisioning of Hong Kong, a strangely beautiful world of iridescent lights of all colours, like a pop art version of ""Blade Runner"". The cinematography of the Oscar winning Guillermo Navarro is excellent too, capturing the nuances of the oily, technical world the film lives in while also bringing out the colours for the maximum dramatic effect. The editing by Peter Amundson and John Gilroy in collaboration with del Toro wisely chooses to go for slower cuts, in particular in the many and frequent action scenes, so as to render them intelligible and to allow the audience not only to understand what is going on but also so that they know the geography of the situation.The major flaw, apart from Ramin Djawadi's blandly generic score, is perhaps the action scenes themselves. Taken individually, each one is shot and edited very well, but by the end, there is a slight, creeping sense of audience fatigue. This is compounded by the fact that the film's most memorable scene is Kikuchi's flashback, which deals with the impact and aftermath of the monsters, rather than a long, extensive battle scene.Despite this, taken as a whole, ""Pacific Rim"" is a whole lot of fun and easily the best summer blockbuster of the year. Oh, and stay through the credits: there is a nice little post-credits scene that deals with the fate of a certain character.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One giant and poorly acted cliché,"In one line: the monster from Cloverfield meets a dumbed down Sons of Anarchy.The point of this movie is solely a way to show the action scenes, the rest is just pointless and aggravating filler. Tired clichés and one liners make up the majority of the dialog, I found it incredibly aggravating. The acting was simply terrible, bar Ron Perlman whom always fits his roles well. Whilst Charlie Hunman's typecast acting style fits SoA, it doesn't make well on the big screen. He overacts in an aggressive manner to compensate for his lack of all other emotions. It's just a bit too boring and reminds me of the kind of acting you get on TV dramas - look hard and sound always annoyed.The action scenes were OK, nothing I hadn't seen before in Transformers, although the city destruction scenes were pretty amazing. If the director hadn't gone down the route of cheese and action cliché, but instead taken his job seriously this could have been a semi decent film. If you like giant robots, Japanese style monsters, and are 12 years old or younger go see this movie, (chances are you will still hate it).",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Quite a fair rate by now,"7.2 out of 10 by now with one fifth million users it is a predictable rate for this movie.Unfortunately this movie didn't earn their budget back leaving a nearly 10 million deficit. It is also foreseeable as using the similar technique as Transformer but as awesome fighting scenes as its, the only consequence is paying back in box. The plot is quite simple fighting the monsters which is quite like a Japanese series used to be seen in childhood, in other words, maybe only children like it and only people want to relax without thinking too munch of movies would like pick this one. Obviously it has some plots aiming to touch the audience but it seems the effects are not very impressive.In terms of the good aspects, at least it gives a happy ending. The giant robots maybe satisfy the geeks. Also I like the perform Rinko did in this film it is definitely a Japanese performing which is very cute. She can be very serious very tough but behind that she is fragile needing a shoulder to rely on. That is also the reason why Japanese girls are good wives they are melt LOL.In conclusion it is fit for children but not for the ones too small maybe 10 years old and above.

"High in spectacle, production value and style, a little lacking however in the substance and depth","Wasn't sure whether to check out 'Pacific Rim'. Reviews were mixed, and those who disliked it (some of vehement) were particularly vocal.This said, being someone who has found much to like about some of Guillermo Del Toro's previous films, especially the brilliant 'Pan's Labyrinth' and who cannot go wrong with actors like Idris Elba and Ron Perlman in the cast, I watched it anyway. Admittedly there are flaws here and they are quite large, but at the same time 'Pacific Rim' also does a good deal right.Starting with what 'Pacific Rim' excelled with, it is an incredible-looking film. The cinematography is immaculate, the editing slick, the set/production design audacious and with a suitable amount of grit, but the star visually is the special effects on the robots, which are mind-blowing and some of the best in recent memory. The action and spectacle is exhilarating stuff and keeps one glued to the edge of their seat, they're big and over-the-top but that was what the film was going for and it succeeds wonderfully. The music score fits very well and has several energetic and haunting moments, though occasionally some intrusive ones.Del Toro does a fine job directing in the action and succeeds in maintaining the silly fun that the film was aiming for (being apparently a homage to the old Godzillas). The film does know what it's trying to be, often has some efficient pacing and target audience is never questioned, which puts it above a fair few similar blockbusters. Not all the acting is great, but there are good performances from a commanding and coolly macho Idris Elba, a expressively understated Rinko Kikuchi and an always reliable if underused Ron Perlman.Charlie Hunnam is rather bland though in the lead, while of the failure that is the comedy double act of Charlie Day and Burn Gorman Charlie Day in particular is incredibly irritating and there are some very off Australian accents (especially from Robert Kazinsky, which keeps coming and going, often speaking in his own accent). 'Pacific Rim' also has some cringe-worthy and vomit-inducingly inane dialogue and paper thin stereotypical characterisation where not much is done to develop the characters and make one properly care for them. Unfortunately, while this reviewer is not afraid to admit that she had a fun time watching the film the story does get bogged down in the non-action scenes in derivative macho drama and over-silliness, the main culprit as aforementioned being the unfunny comedy double act, and the pacing sometimes loses tightness.All in all, kind of a mixed view on this one. Fun and very well made, but not immune to flaws. 6/10 Bethany Cox All in all,",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Get ready to become a 11 year old again,"Pacific Rim is a movie that could possibly lower your IQ as well as anger people expecting the next Pan's Labryinth from Guillermo Del Toro. However it's an entertaining film that hasn't been the disappointment that some of the other blockbusters have been this year. Pacific Rim is essentially a mixture of Transformers, Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots and Godzilla movies. The basic plot for the movie is that giant monsters called Kaiju have come from another dimension deep in the earth's core. As a result humans build giant robots called Jaegers to stop the Kaiju attack. As you can see the story is paper thin with very little character development or background to the film. It is also filled with clichéd characters and more action than Transformers or the Avengers had. If you can get past this you will be transported to the mind of a 11 year old excited at the prospect of seeing giant robots and aliens fighting it out. The action and the CGI are the main reasons and the best parts about the movie. There isn't a lot of shaky cam in the fight sequences which is a good thing. The CGI is incredibly detailed with you actually seeing parts of the Jaegar's body flying off its body. The Kaiju also look very realistic. Despite the weak character development the actors do a good job with what they're giving. Charlie Hunnam(from Sons of Anarchy) and Rinko Kikuchi do a fine job as our main hero's. Charlie Day( from It's always Sunny in Philadelphia) and Burn Gorman do good jobs as the comedic relief for the movie. Ron Perlman and Idris Elba are the two stand out performances just because these two guys are the biggest bad asses in the whole of the movie( with the exception of the giant robots. Overall the movie is good despite its weak character development and paper thin story. It makes you feel like an 11 year old again and it will probably be the most entertaining action film of the whole summer.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Pacific Rim Is a Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Thrill Ride,"Director Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth) has always had a fascination with fantasy and science fiction stories populated with unusual, colorful characters amid macabre settings. Originally set to direct The Hobbit films, he has, instead, switched gears and created a new film populated with mega monsters and super robotic warriors in an exciting, action spectacle, Pacific Rim. What sets this apart from most apocalyptic battles is its well developed characters and relationships. While its subject matter may not be for all tastes, it should satisfy most action and comic fans to the hilt.Set in the not too distant future, a growing threat emerges from an ocean breach in the form of enormous monsters (think Godzilla types) called Kaijus which ravage world cities. To combat these powerful creatures, world leaders construct giant war machines dubbed Jaegers which are controlled from within by a set of mind linked co-pilots. But the threat increases, and the creatures, who have remarkable, adaptive powers, duel with an ever dwindling number of outmatched Jaegers. While mentally linked, the copilots share each other's thoughts and memories. Ace pilot Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) has traumatic memories of loss from an earlier battle and must learn to overcome this while the prospect of a new co-pilot in the form of Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) brings her own horrible past. As relationships are revealed and challenged, the monstrous Kaijus must be met in a last stand not only on land but at its mysterious source beneath the sea.While there is undeniable sexual tension between Becket and Mori, the filmmakers do not settle for clichéd romantic scenes, which a nice change of pace. The film deals primarily with facing and conquering one's own demons. Themes of loyalty, duty and sacrifice crop up. There are super mind melds and a nice dash of samurai mentality in the training and battle scenes, and there are elements of other action films like The Matrix and Top Gun especially towards the end.These Jaegers have some awesome, cool weaponry, and the high tech hardware is detailed and impressive yet well used and realistic. Movies such as The Transformers and the recent super hero films have raised the stakes of massive battle sequences in an urban setting, but Pacific Rim enlarges the playing field even more. And these monsters have tricks up their sleeve that would make even Godzilla envious. Although the scale of the film is breathtaking, del Toro always keeps things grounded in reality and honest emotions. These characters have a camaraderie that evolves throughout the storyline. Just like Peter Jackson in The Lord of the Rings films, del Toro demonstrates an impressive ability to marshal large set pieces while throwing in minute details or intimate moments. These things add to the texture of the story and its players; you begin to care for them.Idris Elba is fast becoming the actor of choice (from his start on TV's The Wire through the recent Prometheus). His role as the leader of the Jaegers, is critical to the storyline, and he even gets to have his own Independence Day/Henry V rallying speech. Charlie Day and Burn Gorman are a riot as rival scientists who bicker while trying to find solutions to the crises. Long time del Toro repertory stalwart Ron Perlman has an amusing supporting role as a black marketeer.Production credits are outstanding on all facets. Special effects are through the roof, and the score by Ramin Djawadi is appropriately heroic and pulsating. Do stay for the initial end credits for an amusing bonus scene.If this is not your cup of tea, it is best avoided. It is true there are perhaps too many climactic battles of these titans (Del Toro even displays a hint of shoe fetish). Yet for those who are game, it is a fun ride and a cut above typical sci-fi fare. For fans and geeks, it is nirvana.If you're going to make a film about giant war machines fighting larger-than-life evil to save the earth and instill the requisite human element, this is a textbook example of how to do it right. Imagine that: a sci-fi blockbuster that moves you! Boy, they are going to sell a lot of toys with this one!",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
well now....that was rubbish wasn't it!,"Just terrible. Really, truthfully, I promise you – terrible. I had to consider if 1/10 was too harsh but thinking the film through i genuinely can't justify giving it a 2! We know that special effects exist and they can pretty much do anything these days – so, big deal. (I didn't even think they were that special to be honest)I was squirming in my seat, anxious – waiting for it to end (it wasn't a quick death either, I can tell you).This is a B-movie in 2 years.

Unique film that could have been a 10,"This was everything that a summer action film should be. Stunning graphics, a unique story line, solid plot, solid acting (though this was likely the weak point) and a very well paced movie. I found myself in sheer awe of many of the CGI scenes. They were really, really well done. Stunning in fact.This movie could have actually been a 9 or 10 with better acting and tweaks to the script. That said, this was an absolutely entertaining film that is sure to be added to my personal video library. It will be a great ""demo Blu Ray"" for any home theater enthusiast.BTW, Idris Elba was the stand out of the actors. He did an excellent job. A couple of the others were also solid, but no one rose t Idris' level. Had they hired better actors, this could have been even better.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pretty excellent!,"I didn't have any expectations going into this and also didn't have much knowledge about it aside from Del Toro being the director. In a short description- it was excellent! A ton of fun, great characters, amazing visual effects, a story that doesn't fall under clichés. That's basically it in a nutshell, and the actual story stands-out from all of these seemingly formulaic and predictable blockbusters. I was hesitant about Charlie Hunman (although I remember him from Undeclared, much skinnier back then though) but he was a pretty great leading man and I have high hopes for his future. Del Toro nailed it with this, and hope he continues to give us more mainstream-fare.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It's not art and it's barely entertainment,"I thought to myself ""giant monsters beaming themselves into the pacific, fighting giant robots, what could be wrong with that?"" And the answer is, quite a bit...quite....a....bit.I'll start with what del Toro has done well here, he's created some incredible sets, I mean these sets are enormous, and he's used CGI to make these hangers and workshops every bit as jaw dropping as you'd hope if the world had really pooled its resources in such a way. If only your favorite nerd sci fi TV show had this budget. There are some great scenes, great stills. And for the effort here, and for the balls to make such a movie, I'm giving this a pass. 5 out of 10.From about the 2 minute mark, or very early on at least, the movie pretty much tells you what kind of movie you are are about to watch, for the next 2.4 hours of your life. Firstly it's a movie with no real people in it. The authorities in this world must be incredibly stupid for a start, who are wanting to abandon the fighting machine project in favor of building sea walls. After 25 seconds of this movie we know that his insane, and that here we are dealing with a 12 year old world in which the authorities are pretty much no smarter than your stupid parents. The good guys, the warriors, are unfortunately no smarter, despite all the cool things they've surrounded them selves with, and have the emotional intelligence of wookies. These characters are so clichéd and predictable you want to slap them all every time you see them. A movie like Starship Troopers is Hamlet compared to this screenplay.Beyond this, the only remotely interesting thing is watching the fight scenes and the monsters trash the cities. But I venture that despite the huge budget thrown at it, even this does not deliver. To make the monsters continually more scary del Toro relies more and mo on CGI throughout, and so they become less and less real. For all their size and fury, they are far far far less scary than the monster from Cloverrfield, to pick a random monster comparison. And the fight scenes, really start to get boring, and the end is merciful indeed.All in all, the question is ""how can a 170 million dollar budget result in something so unsatisfactory?"". This movie is terribly out of proportion, a movie from the mind of a child, and the budget of Apple, it isn't good, it's not art, it's barely entertainment.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great Movie Depending On What You're Looking For,"If you want some uber fantastic CGI, action packed, monster pounding, rockets blasting, loud booms and explosions then you'll love this movie because it does that VERY well. If you're expecting a deep and well crafted story, you'll be a bit disappointed. The strong point of this movie is the struggle of the human race against all odds. The courage, bravery, and comradery that everyone has to go through to make it together. It displays a lot of inspirational moments and makes you remember who you are as a human being, weak and fragile. We may not be much alone but together we can overcome anything. An inspirational action packed robots and aliens movie in summary. Not a romantic or a movie filled with plots and twists. Movie is obviously geared towards younger audiences.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Quick review,"Pacific Rim is a sci-fi, action packed summer blockbuster of 2013. The movies takes place when Earth is being invaded by gigantic aliens that none any already-existed weapons can sufficiently take down, the human creates the Jaegers which are gigantic piloted robots to counter and end the invasion.   To me, this is what summer movies should be. The movie has stunning visual effects. The robots are beautifully crafted and rendered. Action scenes are breath-taking. If you want an all-out, ass-kicking, robot-smashing, explosive goodness, this is the movie.   However, don't expect complex plots, well-developed characters WITH phenomenal action. Characters are predictable and simple. There are no sub-plots in the movie, just saving the Earth and kicking asses.   In my opinion, this is a great movie to watch but it could be better developed, both the fighting and the human characters.

Again being non American he's probably well aware that international audiences get a bit fed up watching hunky square jawed brave Americans saving mankind so he's brought a multinational twist to the story . The head of the military is black? Fair enough but why's he talking with a London accent worthy of Dick Van Dyke himself ? Who cares and we have American actors playing British characters complete with weird accents and no one in this film is capable of doing an Australian accent and it sums up the rest of the characters and the film itself where everything is camp , colourful and there's a constant wink to the audience that's constantly saying "" Look this is absolute B movie nonsense but come on you're enjoying every single silly minute of this aren't you ?""I know I enjoyed every single silly minute of this B movie nonsense .

Beneath Pacific rests our greatest enemy.,"A visual treat, I must say and a fairly good movie. Seriously I expected something bigger from the director who made me believe that fairy tales could be serious in Pan's Labyrinth. The movie certainly is bigger technically but falls behind novelty. Everybody has known transformers, battleship etc.., and not again with this combats. I've seen these animated combats way before in 1998 when I played metal fatigue game. Actors did a fair job sailing along the script and I disagree with the other reviewer who was telling that actors were bad. The first 10 minutes was excellent and I felt like 'm gonna see something like District 9 but the movie lost pace in the middle and got highly predictable (something like a lunch with a good soup and a bad main course). The bottom line is that the movie is visually appealing with nicely written dialogs to match but falls behind any new essence.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Just plain fun!,"While I wasn't completely blown away by this movie like some other reviewers I did enjoy this quite a bit. It's more than an action movie, it has a decent story to keep you entertained while there aren't battles going on.One comparison I've heard is that this is just like Transformers. These people couldn't be more wrong. Transformers is for pure entertainment and the story comes second. I feel like this movie was better at making sure the story was relative to the action that was taking place. I also think that when there was action, it was shot better. And what I mean by that is the camera doesn't seem to shake and you don't only get quick bits and pieces of the fight.What I would compare it too, would be the T.V. show, ""Power Rangers"". All of those episodes would usually end with a battle between an enlarged creature against the Power Rangers who combined their droids, zords, I can't remember. Anyway, think of that but with the action 100 times better! If you enjoy action, some funny one liners, and a decent story that brings it all together, definitely give this a shot!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This is how all Hollywood blockbusters should be.,"Despite a few too many Guillermo del Toro fantasy movies leaving me cold, particularly with the overrated Pan's Labyrinth, for some reason, I had hope that Pacific Rim would be my Summer hit of the year. It's felt too much like there's not been anything genuine to be excited about with Iron Man 3, Man Of Steel, World War Z and The Lone Ranger to name a few, not satisfying audiences. Although I'm not a fan of Transformers or the other monster movies that are obvious influences, I had hope that Del Toro's art-house sense of cinema would blend well with the Hollywood inevitable attributes, as the latter is the price to pay for a movie of this epic scale. I enjoyed Hellboy back in the day but sometimes it got a little too dark and serious to be fun whereas Pacific Rim looked like a ball from start to finish. And it most certainly is. While too many Summer movies of the last decade find themselves swallowed up by their paint-by- numbers plot with any random thing filling in the gaps, Pacific Rim finds a great balance between the plot and the characters' stories, helped by its talented cast plucked from TV, especially Charlie Hunnam and Charlie Day, my personal favourite.Its script is constantly surprising and intriguing, even if structurally predictable, and it sets up its world in a fascinating way in those first few minutes. Although it can be melodramatic, whenever it dragged it picked itself back up again and set the stakes back in motion. It's an absolute delight to have a movie with actual set-pieces to balance out with the all-CGI world too, I just love the inside the Jaeger set. However, admittedly, there are times when the action is frustratingly cluttered, it has awesome and truly involving moments that completely make up for those moments of confusion. A scale like this hasn't been touched since The Lord Of The Rings and here it's is utterly awe-spiring. But what makes it special is that the action always means something to the characters and the plot and is never there for the sake of banal excitement. It has a great sense of humour too though sometimes it can be a bit too campy but that seems to be the lashings of Del Toro's style. Nevertheless, Pacific Rim is one of the most entertaining blockbusters in a long, long time thanks to its characters, great writing and creative epic special effects. This is how it's done.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The worst movie I have ever seen by far,"I have no idea what kind of drugs people must have been taking to enjoy this film. I mean there is nothing good about the movie even the action scenes are slow and boring. The worst part of this movie was the terrible acting. The acting in this film was so over the top every word that Becket character said sounded forced and something action man might say, even in the dramatic scenes he would not alter his voice he showed no emotion during the whole film he just sounded like action man or something. It was just him every actor spoke like this and even the speech was ridiculous and had no soul or meaning to it everyone in this movie is bloody action man. I found myself constantly checking the time hoping this piece of dribble would end. I didn't even stay for the ending it was that cliché and obvious.

The most intelligent monster movie you'll ever see,"In the year 2020, a dimensional portal opens up in the Pacific Ocean, and our world is besieged by giant monsters called Kaiju (Japanese for 'strange creature'). In response, humanity created large robots called Jaegars (German for 'hunter') to fight these creatures. Unfortunately, the Kaiju are winning, and it's up to a washed-up former pilot and a rookie to save humanity from being annihilated. Pacific Rim is the brainchild of Guillermo Del Toro, visionary director of such visually striking films as Hellboy and Pan's Labyrinth. Pacific Rim isn't a remake or a movie 'based on anything' (aside from Del Toro's love of old-school monster movies), which is refreshing considering Hollywood's nauseating obsession with sequels, remakes, and superhero comic adaptions.First, and foremost, the CGI in Pacific Rim is some of the best you will ever see. The Jaegars and Kaiju look awesome, especially when they are beating the tar out of each other (and destroy cities in the process). It is definitely worth the 3D upcharge. Del Toro's film also features a well-developed and colorful cast that keeps the film from being 'all-style no-substance', like similar big-budget action films like Transformers and Battleship. A noteworthy performance comes from Dr. Newton Geiszler (played by Charlie Day of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia fame), a very enthusiastic and easily-excitable scientist that provides some big laughs and crucial insight into the Kaiju and how to defeat them. Ron Perlman has a memorable, but brief role as the Black Market Kaiju organ dealer Hannibal Chou (whose name comes from his favorite historical figure and his second-favorite Chinese restaurant). Details like how the robots operate, where the monsters come from and some of their biological facts (often provided animatedly by the aforementioned Doctor) are not only clever, but they give the world a certain degree of plausibility, another feature often absent from similar films. There is also a quick scene mid-credits which is worth sticking around for.Pacific Rim is not without flaws, though. At points, the dialogue was hard to hear, although this may have been the theater's fault. A few moments in the film will cause viewers to think ""Why didn't they just do that before?"" For example: towards the end of the second act, the Jaegar piloted by the two main heroes suddenly unveils a blade attachment that can slice a Kaiju with ease, clearly more effective than punching and throwing said beast for 10 minutes (though admittedly less exciting). The fight scenes in the second act are so thrilling and over-the-top that the third act feels short and weak in comparison. While the cast is strong and there are surprisingly few cliché/cheesy lines, the rookie and the washed-up pilot (the two main heroes) are not as well-developed as some of the other characters. All of the battle scenes are a treat to watch, but they take place either in the pouring rain or underwater. This doesn't deter from the enjoyment of the film, but to watch the two opposing forces duke it out on a sunny day (or even a cloudy one) would've be nice, so we could see them more clearly.The good far outweighs the bad when it comes to Pacific Rim, and you probably won't ever see a more fun or intelligent monster movie. 7 Robots out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Maybe Clunky in Parts, But Great as a Whole","I was so ready not to like ""Pacific Rim"". It seemed just like another one of those ""giant robot movies that are just all noise and nothing else. Fortunately though, it was a good thing that it was the only movie beginning when I got to the mall this morning. This is so much better than the ""Transformers"" clone I was afraid it would be.""Pacific Rim"" takes place in the year 2020 (not really in the very far future, isn't it?) and the world is under attack from gigantic monsters coming from ocean depths called Kaiju. As the tag line tells us, ""to fight the monsters, we created monsters of our own."" These are in the form of so-called giant mechanical fighting soldiers called Jaegers, controlled by the skills of human controllers.The human team dedicated to fighting these destructive creatures are based in Hong Kong. The soldiers were all hot-headed and macho heroic types, led by Stacker (Idris Elba). The scientists were portrayed as nerdy and caricature-ish comic relief, led by Dr. Newton (Charlie Day).The central character is Raleigh Becket, who previously retired from the Jaegers when his brother and partner died in battle. He was portrayed by Charlie Hunnam, who was not too familiar to me, just another generic blonde Hollywood hunk. The face could have been interchangeable with any of the other Caucasian fighters in there.The lead female character is Mako Mori, an aspiring Jaeger fighter, with a painful past. She is portrayed by Japanese actress Rinko Kikuchi, who we should remember was nominated for Best Supporting Actress back in 2006 for her role in ""Babel"". Here, she appeared to be confused on how to properly portray her role, so she did not come across too strongly as her character should have beenDespite these casting and characterization flaws though, the movie as a whole still turned out very well. Director Guillermo del Toro faced such a challenge to execute a script that dangerously flirted with disaster, deriving obvious comparisons with, not only ""Transformers,"" but also ""Godzilla"", ""Real Steel"", ""Armageddon"". He succeeded to create within this borrowed material enough heart to make audiences root for the good guys and care if they save the day or not.When I was watching as the movie went along, it did matter too much anymore that the acting was not too good, or that the scenes looked familiar, or that the lines get corny. The movie was actually engrossing and entertaining. The special effects were of epic proportions. The whole thing worked as a whole, and that is what matters in the end.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The action scenes are jaw-dropping and are so brilliantly choreographed, without ever going over the top.

The last 2 years of Summer Blockbusters has made me look at the justification of these films - I conclude that we could actual survive without them and instead of using these mega budgets on mega let downs - just give the cash to some charity that needs it - surely that will give us all something to remember unlike 'Pacific Rim'...........",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The monster movie genre is alive and well.,"This is a good movie. The question is: why? The movie is loaded up with special effects, has a lot of cheesy acting, tells a ridiculous story, and in some ways is a rip off of monster movies from the past. Based on that, this movie should qualify as a bomb. Yet it is not a bomb; this movie is good because it is unpretentious. It is what it is and is so without apology. Indeed, this movie glorifies the monster movie genre; it takes it to a higher, more sublime, level. Here the director lets out all the stops and lets the debris settle where it may. The movie conveys a positive message. It is about teamwork and about how humans are able to unite to solve problems. The monsters themselves are not especially surprising. Similar types can be found in many other monster movies. But what is different is how they are treated by the humans and how the humans respond to them. Unlike other monster movies which show humans in mass panic mode, this movie portrays humans as being stalwart and in control. You know they will beat the monsters; it's just a question of how. The monsters are another problem to be solved and the humans do a great job of solving it. This movie is worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

What would be cool was if they visited the Alien world some more.I think Cloverfield could fit into this series though, the monster/alien had similar look about it and would explain where the Cloverfield monster came from lol.I preferred the Godilla movies especially the latest ones where they build giant robot to fight the big monster....sound familiar? lol Overall I was entertained by Pacific Rim and it's worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

In fact, if I didn't know beforehand and I was given 10 other options, I would never bet this was by the Mexican director.The film recomposes itself and improves towards the end. The action is good and the special effects fantastic, but this plot is one of the most bloated that can exist. Bad characters can do nothing to hide a bad cast that doesn't work in many circumstances, including the main lead.The soundtrack is quite interesting and there are two or three actors trying to save the day and manage to grab the pieces, but nothing justifies that a movie about monsters and robots can be sometimes so boring.My least favourite Del Toro film.

Best Giant Monster Movie Ever,"Watching this movie revives the kid in me. When I really enjoy watching Ultraman, Power Rangers, Kamen Rider Series etc. This movie takes it to a whole other level. It's grandiose!!!I get why people don't give this movie high rating. Because the story is quite simple and straight forward. Giant monsters are attacking earth. Now we build giant robots to fight against them. With some drama sprinkled around the mighty action.While the writing is questionable, the action is the best. You wont bother for some medium level acting, plotholes, or underdeveloped character if you saw the fight here. The monsters are truly massive. The way they move and sound are terrifying. The robots (or the Jaeger in the movie) fight impressively. And to be honest, The Cancelling Apocalypse speech is one of the best speech I've ever heard in movie.This movie is something you should see in big screen and good sound system. Truly amazing.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Silly but engaging,"Pacific Rim will feel familiar to anyone who's seen Japanese ""mecha"" anime. Evangelion comes to mind. There are plenty of familiar tropes (competitive environment, the jerk-from-work, the humorless boss who's an ex-badass, underdog status, and many more). But the visuals are quite impressive. I especially liked the many shots of HEAVY equipment; large metal items that need to be tough are appropriately thick and industrial-looking. That's unusual for films of this type.The casting varies from acceptable to good. I especially enjoyed Rinko Kikuchi and her gorgeous eyes. Idris Elba does a fine job (as usual). Ron Perlman shows up in another oddball role (but glad he's getting work).The plot is silly; why weren't underwater nuclear torpedo-launchers stationed around the trench? Wouldn't that be quicker, cheaper, and more effective?I rate this at 6.5 stars, with a half-star penalty for logic fails. That's six (6) stars total.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
#1 problem with this move:  Boring.,"This movie showcased probably the most awe-inspiring, realistic Mecca special effects I have ever seen. Utterly amazing.Unfortunately, they have also succeeded in making the movie boring, boring, boring.

Despite the stunningly realistic special effects, this movie felt completely fake. Perhaps, many viewers can tolerate fake movies as long as there is compelling suspense and drive to hold one's interest. I am sad to say, this movie presented near zero suspense or drive. It's actually a mystery how the makers of this movie managed to kill off all fun and excitement given the awesome effects available to them.

The Vidiot Reviews,"Pacific RimOuch! I once had a fissure on my Pacific Rim.Oops, my mistake. This sci-fi movie is about a fissure in the ocean floor, not one's anus.Under attack from colossal sea-creatures, the military constructs Jaegars, large-scale automatons controlled by pilots, Raleigh (Charlie Hunnam) and Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff), to fight back.But overtime their armour becomes obsolete and other avenues are pursued.With months left in operation, Commander Stacker (Idris Elba) initiates a final mission to detonate a warhead in the monster's portico.Recruiting Raleigh and pairing him with an orphan (Rinko Kikuchi), Stacker has one last chance to destroy the ever-adapting enemy.Guillermo del Toro's ode to Godzilla and Gundam, Pacific Rim's best moments are its bombastic battles, while its worst are when the leads are outside their suits.Furthermore, if giant monsters are anything like us, can you imagine the kinky things they'd do with a life-sized robot?Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not del Toros' finest hour. Still, a fairly amusing time at the movies.","Humans must do battle with massive monsters known as Kaiju when a ""breach"" between dimensions opens deep within the ocean. To do this, the people of the world unite to create equally colossal fighting machines dubbed Jaegers (the German word for ""hunter""). In order to successfully operate a Jaeger, a bond, or ""Drift"", must exist between two pilots, a bond that is mental and spiritual as well as physical. The fate of humanity rests on the shoulders of Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam), who will go into battle with an eager to please rookie (Rinko Kikuchi) at his side.Here, acclaimed filmmaker Guillermo del Toro attempts to play in the same sort of sandbox popularized by movies like ""Independence Day"". Overall, it's more of a visual effects showcase than it is anything else, with a thin story and an over emphasis on spectacle. It comes off like a video game adaptation much of the time, with not too many human moments along the way. Granted, the movie is pleasing to look at sometimes, with a virtual candy store of futuristic images. The Jaegers are also imaginatively designed (at least, their interiors are), although the Kaiju are not particularly impressive.As could be expected, this is not the thing you want to watch if you're looking for truly great acting. Too many of the characters and performances are annoying, although Idris Elba, as Beckets' sombre commanding officer, has a typically solid presence. Hunnam is an underwhelming hero, with no real charisma at his disposal. Ron Perlman, whose working relationship with del Toro dates back to 1992 and the film ""Cronos"", hams his way through a brief role as a sleazebag who deals in Kaiju body parts on the black market. The true saving grace is the cute and appealing Kikuchi.Del Toro does his able best to keep his audience from being bored, but without the desire to consistently root for the heroes, it's hard to care a great deal for many of the characters here.Still, if you just want a gung ho popcorn flick, and aren't looking for substance, ""Pacific Rim"" is passable entertainment.Seven out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

An Offense to Storytelling,"We are told, through a horribly done voice-over, that monsters, known as Kaiju, rose from the sea.

After losing his twin brother and co-pilot, the narrator and main character must prepare to get back into battle before the war is lost.This is one of the most terribly written screenplays, with absolute pathetic attempts at acting, to ever be put to the big screen. This makes Transformers: Dark Of The Moon seem like an epic masterpiece. This is storytelling at it's laziest. For director Guillermo del Toro, this is embarrassing! This is the guy who directed Cronos, The Devil's Backbone and Pan's Labyrinth. Even having his name attached to such horrible horror films as Don't Be Afraid of the Dark and Mama, he did not direct the films, so we assumed he still rocked as a director.

A GOOD ONE-TIME WATCH !,"In Pacific Rim, director Guillermo Del Toro (Hellboy & Pan's Labyrinth) presents us a Godzilla meets Transformers flick of monumental proportions.In the not-too-distant future, a race of monstrous aliens called Kaiju (Japanese for monster) attack earth through an underwater portal in the depths of the Pacific ocean. They wreak havoc on several coastal cities across the globe laying persons & property to waste in the typical Hollywood style assited with a good dose of CGI. After finding that the conventional weapons are futile against these monsters which appear evolving into ever more dangerous creatures, humans respond by building their own combat force of monstrous robots called Jaegers (German for Hunters). Every Jagger is required to be piloted by two humans since a single human is incapable -mentally & physically - of controlling this colossal machine. The brains of the two pilots are connected through a technology called neutral drift which in turn operates as a singular command unit controlling the Jaeger.What follows is a series of visceral action set pieces in which the Jaegers take on the Kaijus on land, water and even air through traditional combat styles that includes fisticuffs, swords and some heavy duty artillery. The success of these movies depend a lot on the level of visual mastery which could make the viewer go WOW. The story and the characters are at best props that aid in unravelling the carefully planned action set-pieces though Del Toro does try valiantly to build certain emotional depth to each of the characters.While Del Toro is no Cameron or Whedon here, it helps that he is definitely not Michael Bay either. He definitely knows the quality of output that is required to engage the viewer without making a mere noisy mangled mess of the visual effects through stunts where one never knows who is fighting whom to what effect. The action here, while loud (which puts me off personally) is well designed, executed with panache and captured well which engages the viewer (especially in IMAX 3D). A rousing score accentuates the action on screen though, at times, it gets drowned in the melee of the wreckage around.It may not score big on the front of story or characters that touch your heart or a plot that engages your grey matter. It is designed to be and remains a delectable eye-candy for action junkies who prefer some well executed action setpieces on some CGI wizardry and to that extent, is very satisfying and fun watch. Guilty pleasure, if one may prefer to call it so ....",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

One-trick pony that goes on waaay too long,"""Pacific Rim"" is one thing and one thing only: giant robots punching giant monsters. This goes on for a shade over two hours.Look, I totally get that this is a homage to the monster movies of an earlier era (movies that I enjoy too). And all the right ingredients are here. However, the end result felt to me like a cold paint-by-numbers exercise with a vast visual effects budget.Fortunately, I don't think that del Toro ever fell into the trap of taking any of it seriously: there's a sense of sly fun that permeates the movie all the way through to a short scene embedded in the closing credits. However, this wasn't enough to save the movie for me, where a 25-minute, Saturday-morning-cartoon plot is expected to support a 130-minute feature film. To be honest, despite all the undeniably impressive visuals, I was horribly bored by the end.To some degree, I think the ultra-realistic visuals worked against the movie. The basic premise of choosing to combat giant sea monsters by building giant robots to engage them hand-to-hand is of course ridiculous. That's not something that should matter in this particular genre: plausibility is very definitely not part of the fun. However, for me at least, the realism of the presentation seemed to demand a more realistic premise. It just seemed very weird to have such nonsense presented so highly naturalistically.I mostly enjoyed ""Pacific Rim"" but was very glad when it was over.

The action scenes are amazing. I had to re-watch plenty of scenes just because I didn't see everything the first time. There is also some humor in it which is a nice break from the constant action.Is there something I didn't like? I felt there was a lack of imagination considering the fact that the action happened most of the time in the Ocean. More battle locations would have been great. I also didn't like the love story.

Style over substance and not in a good way,"Robots hit monsters. Am I meant to care? Guillermo del Toro's latest project involves humans controlling enormous robots and beating up Godzilla style monsters emerging from the ocean. It's very satisfying that this didn't actually do that well in America, because this is just total formula. We don't need movies like this. We've seen it all before. This action garbage has silver linings here and there. Visually, it's interesting and has plenty of awesome imagery. It's got a strong colour palette. Del Toro's direction is merely acceptable, but there is a sense of wonder in the movie, and the CGI genuinely looks great. In terms of style and visuals, the movie is quite strong and not everything can be deep and meaningful. Many will enjoy this, especially if they see it on a big screen. Pacific Rim frequently feels like a loving tribute to its genre and for some it will be a dream come true. At least it's a bit lighter and less serious than some other blockbusters these days. For some this could be a good antidote to Man Of Steel.I saw this on the small screen so maybe I'm biased. The thing which lets PR down is that it's not just robots hitting monsters. There is an hour between the first and second big robot battles and the film has the cheek to try and emotionally engage us with these pathetic, one dimensional characters. Seriously? The film may look great, but it's so cartoony and flat (While pretending it isn't flat by shoving loads of meaningless backstory down our throats) it's could have been some awful 2 hour cartoon on CBBC. The acting is pretty bad and even Idris Elba isn't that good. The movie just isn't original and since it's actually pretty boring much of the time (I don't care about what happened to the female protagonist when she was a kid!). Del Toro, who also made Pan's Labyrinth, another very overpraised film, is clearly popular because he's a bit different. Difference in modern films is a great things but there's only so long I can look at creatures, dark fantasy and loads of boring weirdness before I give up and watch Godzilla instead.4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Water, Ink","Yes, I do find this man more disappointing than your average action director. It isn't that his movies are any dumber than others. They aren't. It is a reverse prejudice based on two qualities.He has a powerful visual ability, in beings, environments and machines. It irks me to no end that he cannot turn this to visual storytelling. The visuals are engaging. The stories are dull and have no intrinsic connection to what we see.The other expectation is the Hispanic filmmaker's dilemma: so very many use a tradition inaptly called magical realism. Poetry invades physics and we can either have a story where the nature of the story bends the nature of the world, or we have a parallel world interwoven within ours for a while.I am so taken with this style of filmmaking that I would now perish without it. Even Rodreguez has it in his kiddie and troubling exploitation movies. That del Toro seems so oblivious to this richness, while excelling in others that matter....

Saw it twice and my opinion hasn't changed,"Guillermo del Toro has made some of my favorite movies. It seems like everything he touches no matter the genre is the best of it's kind. Although granted most are in the horror, supernatural, Sci-Fi, fantasy realm. All have full well-drawn characters and fascinating stories told with a delicate touch even if during an action or scary scene.But then he tries to out-Michael Bay a robot movie and the results are very disappointing. Typically for del Toro it was a beautiful movie but the characters and story were so cliched and stupid it was insulting. It was like he took a Transformers script and characters and added big monsters. The result was the same, except prettier.I could even deal with the stupid lines and characters as del Toro just playing with the genre and having fun if at every turn, the plot mechanisms as well the mechanisms in the movie itself weren't so boneheaded. I won't get into the hundreds of glaring examples of silliness except for one, the biggest one - Why, if for all the tech our future holds, did they decide to combat the creatures with oversized robots in an urban cage match? Then while the two 'pilots' are mind melded, why do they have to yell at each other during battle? And with everything drive-by-wire, including our own cars, do they have the pilots 'walking' on these giant mechanical shoe platforms?I can play along with monsters from another dimension coming from the earth's core, but the basic concepts of the robots are so stupid it's hard to get past.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The Kaiju shall rise again!,"For ""kaiju-eiga"" (Japanese monster movie) fan-boys, ""Pacific Rim"" has been one of the most eagerly anticipated summer blockbusters for several years now, and for good reason. Due to the passing of legendary special effects artist Ray Harryhausen earlier this year (the film is dedicated to his memory and that of famous Japanese movie director Ishiro Honda - who passed away 20 years ago in 1993), the failure of ""Godzilla"" in 1998, and the reasonable successes of the American found footage/monster flick ""Cloverfield"" in 2008 and South Korea's ""The Host"" in 2006, the monster-on-the-rampage genre has seen some increased relevancy, and legitimacy, in the last decade.As someone who grew up with, and idolized, Godzilla and other famed Japanese movie monsters - Ishiro Honda's ""Gojira"" (1954), Godzilla's dark, gloomy black & white debut, remains the greatest monster movie ever - ""Pacific Rim"" was the first movie I've seen in the movie theater this year, and it was a choice that was well-worth my hard-earned $7.50. I also belong to a Godzilla fan-boy group on Facebook. Upon the release of ""Pacific Rim"" on July 12, 2013, the page ignited with impassioned fan-boy discussions of what could easily be considered the greatest giant monster movie so far this millennium (if ever, but let's not get ahead of ourselves here - ""Gojira"" is still the best this genre has to offer). I'm inclined to agree.I greatly admired J. J. Abrams's take on the monster movie genre with ""Cloverfield,"" and I thought that ""The Host"" was a welcome surprise from one of the last places to pop up on the world cinema market. Now with ""Pacific Rim,"" famed Mexican director Guillermo del Toro's big-budget take on the genre (as well as serving as a delightful homage to his childhood fan-boy obsessions in comic books, Godzilla, Japanese Anime', pop culture, and fantasy) has arrived.Equal parts ""Avatar"" (2009), ""District 9"" (2009), 1998 ""Godzilla,"" Iron Man, ""Top Gun"" (1986), ""Transformers,"" and del Toro's own fervent imagination (together with co-screenwriter Travis Beacham), and featuring an epic score by Ramin Djawadi (which comes close to rivaling the best of the famous Japanese film composer Akira Ifukube), ""Pacific Rim"" begins sometime in the near-future, when mankind is at war with giant, other-worldly sea monsters called ""Kaiju"" (the Japanese word for ""monster"") bent on our destruction. To combat them, we have the Jaegers (the German word for ""hunter""), 250-foot-tall heavily armed, heavily armored giant robots that are piloted by two people who mind-meld to form a single unified consciousness - the better to operate them and fight the Kaiju, we're told.The film's strongest visual appeal comes from the giant monster-robot battles that dominate the film's loudest moments (and pretty much the entire second half of the picture). In today's times, special effects no longer serve to simply enhance movie scenery - as they did in time's past - but essentially to create them. There are some movies in recent years where special effects - namely CGI - are used to create an entire movie and actors seem almost like an after-thought. In recalling the movie, I found it to be a relief that there seems to be a more intricate balance between the battle sequences and the scenes with the flesh & blood human characters.And we get some truly likable, flesh & blood human characters in the form of a jaded former ace Jaeger pilot named Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam), who is called back into the line of duty to once again combat the Kaiju threat; also on-board is his former chief, the hard-nosed Stacker Pentecoast (Idris Elba), who lends the movie sex appeal and scenery-chewing military command presence; and lastly, there's the beautiful, ambitious Jaeger pilot-trainee Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi).Backing them up, is their loyal, wise-cracking systems administrator Tendo Choi (Clifton Collins, Jr.), and a pair of goofy, bumbling Jaeger research scientists - Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day) and Gottlieb (Burn Gorman) - who make several fundamental discoveries about the Kaiju that may just turn the tide of the war in favor of humanity. And, it'll be impossible to miss him, but del Toro's regular go-to guy Ron Perlman (best known from del Toro's earlier ""Hellboy"" superhero movies and ""Blade II"") also shows up as a leather-skinned, back-alley Hong Kong black marketer named Hannibal Chau.As a director and screenwriter, del Toro has always given his films rich character and thematic depth, and philosophical complexity (and not to mention a fine sense of humor, which many big-budget blockbusters these days often tend to lack); ""Pacific Rim"" does not rank up there with his most famous picture to date, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" (2006), but it's actually much closer to his aforementioned ""Hellboy"" films and ""Blade II"" (2002). It's a blockbuster movie, but one that is not without some degree of humanistic depth and merit. The film's core theme revolves around the benefits of working together - ""two heads are better than one,"" as they say - and this is taken to a somewhat literal degree here, in which empathy (the ability to understand another person's feelings) is seen as a bona-fide superpower in and of itself that is capable of allowing just two people to power towering robots to effectively battle an unspeakable threat to humanity.It is this purely humanistic touch that takes the spectacle away from the many dazzling special effects-driven action sequences that ""Pacific Rim"" has to offer and instead places it on the human characters at the center of it all. This is something that is purely at the center of much of Guillermo del Toro's best work.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A decent but forgettable popcorn movie,"Guillermo del Toro brings his unique creative sensibilities to a genre that's been pushed into the ground, and while the results are entertaining and cool to watch it still has this ""been-there-done-that"" feel. For one, this level of destruction has been done before in all of the Transformers movies, and while it's more competently filmed here you can't escape the feeling that you've seen most of this stuff before. A few quibbles about this: no attention is paid whatsoever to collateral damage, but then again, that's a problem with the violence in most PG-13 movies. Also, the decision to film most of the action at night and around the ocean results in it being a little hard to follow due to the poor lighting and the fact that the robots and kaiju take up most of the screen because of their immense size. Moving on, I thought that the comedic relief in the form of two bickering scientists was well written and played, although it didn't really serve the story too much until the end. In fact, the story as a whole wasn't really spectacular, and was filled with a lot of cliché moments and was very predictable. Despite all of these things, it was fun to watch and I had a good time. An entertaining, but ultimately forgettable, popcorn flick.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Awe-Inspiring, Visually Stunning","I loved watching this movie in 3D in the theater! This movie made me feel like a kid again, I was absorbed and entranced by the stunning, colorful action and visuals. It's the kind of movie that gives you something to daydream about. I loved watching and idea of these giant robot Mechs. Gives you that I-love-science-and-technology feeling.The entire movie has this quality I have never seen before, wherein the feel of it was bleak and gritty, but at the same time it was very colorful and futuristic and fantastic.These days in action movies often the action sequences are hard to follow because the director employs too many cuts and blurs, I assume to make it seem more exciting. But here I never had the thought, as I often do in other action movies, ""When is this action scene going to end... yawn... what is even going on?""I took off one star though because the movie isn't perfect. For instance, the main character is extremely forgettable, I could not even tell him apart from this other more minor character in the movie that looks similar. And then there was Elba's character and performance, there was something off about it. It's hard to put into words, the delivery of his lines was unconvincing at times: flat or the timing was off.I enjoyed the female lead. She's a gentle soft-spoken Japanese woman, and the movie does not apologize or overcompensate for it. Her character isn't the generic female lead who sneers at Mr. reckless rebellious protagonist at first and then gets won over and falls in love with him. Instead the male and female leads develop a hearty platonic friendship based on mutual understanding and shared experience.The movie had a rainbow of colorful characters, like the goofy scientists, the bleach-blonde rockstar-looking russians you see in the background, Ron Perlmen's character, they were all welcome comic relief to whole serious aliens-are-trying-to-wipeout-all-of-humanity situation.The movie is well done, but there is no denying it is completely formulaic. I instantly saw so many parallels between this movies and for example, Independence Day. The film is very much classic Hollywood, three-act, Joseph Campbell's-Hero's Journey stuff.And the whole premise of the movie doesn't make sense. If aliens were attacking earth, why would you build two-legged humanoid mechs to punch them and shoot at them at close range? Makes zero sense from an engineering standpoint. But all that is forgivable because after all... MECHS! But still worth pointing out... there are other things in the movie like that but I won't get into it.The special effects in the movie are amazing, and the director knew what he was doing with them. There were so many points in the movie where I was just in awe of how beautiful and well-put-together the action and special effects were. Moments where I appreciated watching something that felt absolutely PERFECT.If you are in the mood for a colorful action movie, run to the theaters now! I could see someone not liking it though if they need something deep or logical, this movie is a fun formulaic action movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Very Entertaining,"I remember really enjoying this film when I was younger, the idea of giant machines fighting Godzilla creatures was incredibly captivating. If you go into Pacific Rim hoping to view some large scale fight scenes you will certainly get what you want. However the smaller features of this film can drag it down to the level of Marvel films upon rewatch, although I would put this on a higher pedestal than most of those.My first problem is the film's pacing, we open up with an exhilarating fight scene which really sets the tone of what's to come. But then the rest of the first act really drags. We don't see any more fight scenes for a massive chunk of the film and then the last 30 minutes is just action. I wouldn't say I was ever bored watching Pacific Rim, it just had the tendency of straying away from what made the film stand out.Another problem I have is the lighting and colour grading. I think a lot of the fight scenes are way too dark and the character scenes have adopted this murky yellow/brown colouration. This could be intentional to create an industrial feel to these scenes however it doesn't excuse the film from looking ugly.One of the best aspects of this film is it's score/soundtrack which really lifts the action to another level.Overall I do think Pacific Rim is worth a watch but don't expect to be motivated to ever watch it more than once.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

two hours wasted,"Well that was two hours of my life which I will not recover. Fortunately I did not pay to see this absurd oeuvre, but borrowed the DVD from the local library. But this is what kids now spend their allowance on??Too many things to comment on, but among them are: how can only 8 helicopters lift one of these robots, when they weigh 2500 tons? Why don't the kaiju's attack en masse, rather than just one or two at a time? Why can't the robots be controlled remotely, rather than risking the lives of 'pilots'? Why not simply shoot a missile (using all those helicopters) down the kaiju's throat when it inevitably opens up to make a loud roar?",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Credit Dedication at  end of  film,"It was a nice touch of Del Toro to add a dedication at the end of the movie Pacific Rim for the 2 master monster makers RAY HARRYHAUSEN (BEAST FROM THE 20,000 FATHOMS 1953) & INOSHIRO HONDA (GODZILLA KING OF THE MONSTERS 1954)the start of the kaiju movies, It would be much better if you added some picture's from those 2 movies (with studio permission of course) and put them on the DVD or Blu-ray disk as extras when the movie PACIFIC RIM comes out to the public. Many people were not born during the 1950's and have no idea who those 2 people that are called master monster makers are, but are known to all science fiction film buffs.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Guillermo del Toro knows his stuff,"I'm always somewhat like a kid on Christmas eve when it comes to Guillermo del Toros movies. I don't expect the world or an eye-opening life-changing experience, but I do expect to be entertained. He has a combination of visual flair, and understanding of how you build an effective action scene (and in extension action movie) which makes a potent cocktail.The plot is pure nonsense, and is rushed by mostly through voice-over right from the start. Seemingly just to get it out of the way. ""Bla bla, giant monsters attack and we build robots to meet them in a boxing-match."" Honestly, most of the plot is not explained much further in the film than in the trailer. Acting ranges between bland and pretty lame, some of the actors are competent performers, but it's not like they are especially challenged in this movie.So, with that out of the way, let's talk essentials. I'm not a fan of the monsters, they look clumsy and lack elegance. Generally though, this movie is beautiful. del Toro knows how to get the adrenaline flowing with visuals and a suitably high-octane soundtrack. Everyone talks tough, walks tough and acts tough. It doesn't always work, and parts of the story feel tacked-on and just an interruption to the action. But mostly though, the movie delivers when it comes to action and excitement.I view this as a guilty pleasure. Something that should appeal mostly to 13-year-olds, and not men three times their age. But still, even though I can't say that I feel like seeing it again, it entertained me for most of the duration.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Shallow rip-off of Neon Genesis Evangelion,"Guillermo Del Toro has an amazing visual sense. His movies are beautiful to watch. However this was visually interesting but otherwise shallow and plot less. This felt like a live action version of Neon Genesis Evangelion. The character were all 1 dimensional archetypes. Other than fight scenes in CGI - which I didn't find that interesting, there's not much to the film. There was not even an interesting backstory on the Kaiju. Their dinosaur form and adaptation to battles was kind of interesting but wasn't explored. The entire plot and ending was completely obvious (you knew who would fall in love, who would nobly sacrifice themselves, who was going to die, etc.)",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Lot Better Than I Thought It Was Going To Be,"I remember entering the movie theater not expecting much and leaving the movie theater completely impressed. I wasn't expecting this movie to be bad, but I didn't expect it to be that great either.As we all know, the idea of humans piloting robots to fight monsters is nothing new. It's been used in several other movies, TV shows, and video games. However, this film took it to the next level with its engaging storyline, gripping action, and stellar special effects.While there are pros to this movie, there's bound to be some cons too. I didn't think the acting was that great, quite a few of the characters weren't very likable, and the writing was a bit hammy at times.But the pros outdo the cons because I still enjoyed this film.

A spectacularly mind-blowing movie that should go down in 3D film history,"Okay, don't get me wrong. This movie was a thousand times better than any of the Transformers movies. I'll tell you why: the story was better, the effects were fantastic, and to be honest, the Gypsy Danger and Cherno Alpha truly made me feel small compared to Optimus Prime and Bumblebee.The tagline of the movie sold me: To fight monsters we created monsters. If you don't know anything about the movie, just learning the tagline gives you a general idea.What makes this film truly amazing to me is the fact that it was mesmerizing like other of my favorite visual effect movies like Zack Snyder's Man of Steel and James Cameron's Avatar. The acting was also great. The graced performances of Idris Elba (Golden Globe winner, Luther), Rinko Kikuchi (Oscar Best Supporting Actress, Babel), Charlie Hunnam (Sons of Anarchy), and Ron Perlman (Golden Globe winner, Beauty and the Beast) were seen as clever and entertaining.Some before even seeing the film might have said that this movie was all visuals and has no real plot, but they were proved wrong. The story was solid and creative. And yes, the big robotic machines were awesome, but the story was too.Now seeing this movie in IMAX 3D is the only way you can have fun at the theaters. Seeing it regularly at the movies isn't as ""magical"" as IMAX 3D is. Not only did the effects look great, but the sound was too. The heart-pounding stomp of the Jaeger's (German for ""hunter"", the gigantic robots created by the humans) monstrous feet treading through a destroyed city made you feel like you were standing right in front of it. The roar of the colossal Kaiju (Japanese for ""strange creature"", the monsters of the movie)coming out of the water made you tremble in fear.What else is there to say? This was one of the best times I've had at the movie theater since seeing Man of Steel. When this comes out on Blu-ray, I am buying it and putting it in my favorite films collection.Now if this movie isn't nominated for at least ONE Oscar, I will truly be disappointed with the Academy...",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Kaiju wants the little dude!,"The first time I watched this, I didn't really like it. I checked out the second one though and I really liked it, so I thought I'd give this a second chance.This time I really enjoyed it, it's not perfect. The best scenes are the voice over ones that introduce everything and a flash back scene. Everything comes together seamlessly, it even brings the feels that the rest of the movie doesn't have. The Jaeger fights in this are alright, aside from the first one they're kind of alright nothing really happens until the end.The characters are pretty bland but interesting enough to keep you entertaining, just not much depth to them. Very similar to those in horror movies, they have their quirks but aside from that a bit flat. The stand out character is Charlie Day's Newt, he steals every scene he's in. He just chews up the scenery, he also bring a lot of rumor to quite a bleak movie. Ron Perlmanwas awesome as well, I did like the rest of the cast as well but they stood out the most.All in all it was pretty good, quality wise I'd say this movie is on par with Man of Steel and Godzilla King of the monsters.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

One hell of a movie,"I went into the cinema with a couple of friends expecting to be entertained for a few hours and have a laugh, but we came out more than shocked. Sitting through a couple of this year's blockbusters like Man of Steele, Fast and Furious amongst others, needless to say I was quite surprised when I came out immediately acknowledging this was the best movie I've seen all year, not just from this guy-genre type of film.Pacific Rim is over the top and a whole lot of fireworks, but what puts it aside from other run-of-the-mill action flicks is that it takes itself seriously. Aside from some cliché comic relief, that at the very least was enjoyable, you were rooting for the heroes in the movie all along. What's so curious about the movie is that it starts on a peak of excitement, and it never lets go. I'm sure many pseudo-intellects would argue, but if you allow yourself to indulge in the world, you're rewarded.. Shallowly. But hey, if you can't enjoy a bunch of giant robots shattering huge creeps you must have dropped your balls too hard, since they clearly left base and rolled away.Spurring you along with an exciting composition of music, you can't help but smile as these huge robots punches it out with impressive monstrosities. Much of the excitement stems from the fact that the overgrown antagonists actually pose a threat to our heroes, unlike so many other similar flicks.I swear, a tendril of drool was running down my lips in glee as we see the Gypsy Danger robot be assembled. The sound is well constructed, the machines well-designed, so you can practically feel the weight of these giant machines.. And that is the accomplishment. You're not perpetually faced with the question of ""Geez, couldn't they have animated this better"", as everything is done well, opposed to lackluster examples such as Transformers.In short, bring a group of guys together, go watch it and frollic. No girls allowed and no dull heads either.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

So don't get me wrong, this movie is 'fun.'If you were expecting an even remotely believable plot, characters with depth, serious tone, and Tom Hanks type acting ability that makes you feel the feels, then this is NOT the movie you want to see.Many of the acting scenes in this movie just made me cringe.

Del Torro I salute you,"I have been following this movie for a while now. Largely because I thought it would be like the transformers franchise. Watched it in 3D(I have always strayed away from 3D before because I just didn't think it was worth spending the extra cash) but this time I do not regret my choice at all. It was a visual feast and you cant imagine a movie better than this for visual effects/dialogue delivery.Now the real highlight of the picture, the visuals are overall shiny and snazzy. The designs of the creatures and robots are palpably marvelous. As the special effects move these heavy giants, the action did something better than just blowing up stuff. Although explosions and loud noises are not actually flaws(It's about giant robots, c'mon!), but a real good set piece needs a decent and genuine fortitude. In the midst of the noises, you will always get the sense of danger to the Jaegers, mostly because there are human pilots beneath the ravaging machines.

3D marvel and amazing film,"This week I watched Nelson Mandela pilot a giant robot in order to fight monsters in Guillermo del Toro's, Pacific Rim Okay, not quite.Pacific Rim is visually unparalleled in the kick-ass-destructive-giant-robots-meet-alien- monster-mash-up movie genre. It's one of the very few movies where the 3D was done with such an art that you can't help but marvel at how amazing and effective it is. You see, the problem with the 3D gimmick is that it normally takes your eyes at least as long as the opening scene to acclimatize to the 3D, which is a waste if you consider that you're watching a film at almost triple what it would normally cost you. Plus, you're wearing awkward plastic goggles on your face which only seem to dim the brightness of the screen.In Pacific Rim there are a number of devices implemented to re-enforce the 3D effect with intelligently placed objects that work to refresh the neutral depth–which basically means you don't have to take your glasses off every 20 minutes or so. Bottom line: the 3D in Pacific Rim is worth its price.If you thought you saw the entire film when you watched the trailer, you are very much mistaken. Apart from two clips, the trailer only covers the events in the first 25-minute opening sequence. Pacific Rim is a lot larger than what I expected! True to del Toro form, Pacific Rim has a lot of depth and isn't simply a film with a narrow backbone to carry a visual and action-filled spectacle. Guillermo del Toro has already voiced his plans for a sequel, and, after watching the first film, it looks like it's going to be on par with the best of them.Pacific Rim is a must-see film! It's more mature and polished than the Transformers franchise and easily the best film I've seen this year.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pacific Rim,"Del Toro's latest tentpole, watched in 3D format on IMAX screen, a substantial SFX Jarger Vs. Kaiju monolith which makes TRANSFORMER franchise pale in comparison. But the feeble storyline and unimaginative character-building drags the film into a scrape of torpor. especially after the seasonal actioners' drumfire (after WHITE HOUSE DOWN 2013, 6/10 and FAST AND FURIOUS 6 2013. 6/10), PACIFIC RIM is the most costly one, and its red-hot accomplishment in the Chinese box office suggests a belated chance to break even its tepid reception in the North American domain, with its Japan opening this coming weekend, an approximate $400,000,000 worldwide turnover may green-light a sequel for its ardent followers.The 3D effect surely doesn't improve at all thanks to the murky palette of the raining night combat and underwater location, under the 3D monopoly (even more absurd there are 4D version available in theaters) at least in China, we have no access to the plain 2D type, which rumor says its rendition is much better in an IMAX screen. Dedicated to Japanese Tokusatsu films, Del Toro and his crew's reconstruction and invention of genre is groundbreaking, an eye- opener with excellent technical scrupulousness, the bombarding sound effects are overwhelming as well as its awe-inspiring and heroic battle scenes.There are some hiccups keep bugging me, an obvious one is that why on earth there is no conventional weaponry assistance engaging in the doomsday battle, not even as the cannon fodder; another one is the last moment sword stunt, saving the best for the last may not work here, it is only for practicability, but an ill-considered one. Hunnam doesn't possess enough charisma to carry on the film on his shoulder and his platonic relation with Kikuchi hasn't been dug deep enough to steal the limelight. Other actors are standard equipments, Elba is the commander whose background story desperately needs a prequel. Day is the comic relief and Perlman is the egomaniac laughing-stock.Del Toro's Hollywood odyssey has been rougher than one had presumed, PACIFIC RIM is a qualified film in the sense of it is an updated product for the genre criterion (let's wait and see how GODZILLA will handle the challenge next year), but it doesn't live up to Del Toro's talent if one familiars with his earlier films, notably his homespun masterpiece PAN'S LABYRINTH (2006, 9/10), where mythology and reality have been miraculously criss-crossed and not only our eyes are being opened, our hearts are also being filled with passion and vibration.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pacific Grim.,"Going in with this expectation, you will not be disappointed, but if you think you will have an awe inspiring experience you might have a bad time. I just seen it in IMAX and I have to say that half of the time I couldn't tell what's going on during the fight sequences. I'm not the only one here complaining about this. It is clearly an editing defect and also a color grading defect since everything is too dark during the fights. I do not understand this new trend by splitting the movie in very long and stale sequences and then cut to endless fighting scenes which strain the eye and over-saturates the senses. Just intertwine them up into a more coherent story driven film. It is not rocket science. It's editing 101.The acting was exactly what you would expect from a robots vs monsters film. Nothing more nothing less; cardboard cutouts, stereotypical, without any arcs. There is only one female role (except few others extras) in the whole film which is totally out of balance with the social dynamic created within the narrative.The music is good and it works. It is funny that ""works"" today turned into a compliment though. It does a good job of embracing brutal fighting sequences and it also works on squeezing out that much needed gram of emotion. It feels really nice to hear thematic and fleshed out melodic material making a comeback in a world where soundtracks have become mostly sound design.CGI is well... CGI. The monsters sometimes look silly, not menacing enough and the giant robots seem very fragile and clunky. I know this is a form of a tribute to the golden age of cinematography where giant monsters were some guys dressed up in rubber suits walking around a set made out of cardboard, but a tribute should be a short and clear statement, not an entire two hours film. In my opinion, CGI should complement and augment good acting, good story telling, good character development, not to be the sole reason for the existence of a film. Yes, this is a robots vs monsters movie, but that doesn't justify disregarding the very foundation that makes up a cinematic experience. Popcorn and all, i saw at least three opportunities for the story to take an alternate route to a more complex and fulfilling end scenario.Like any other of my fellow sci-fi enthusiast, I can suspend my disbelief. I can even stretch it pretty far. But I cannot in good faith support the stupidity needed for a story to exist. Darwin winning prize minds thought it was better to build giant robots that work via an incredibly complicated and unexplainable mind meld of two people instead of arming strategic nuclear devices on the bottom of the Pacific and detonating them whenever one of the monsters emerge. I have games where I can operate giant robots using my keyboard and mouse only. There are surgeons who in extremely difficult operations are using robots that are capable of performing incredible and accurate tasks. There are guns today that can inflict unimaginable chaos and destruction on almost any kind of earthly scale. Yet in this film, we need giant clunky robots that perform ninja-like actions to wrestle and beat the monsters to a pulp, piloted by some people that are somehow compatible to mind meld in a black magic driven process. And let's put them right in the middle of the action, because you know, remote control is too futuristic. We see steel penetrating the monster's skin while F22 rockets are barely effective against it, because again, there's nothing better than a knife at a gunfight. This is Occam's razor violation at its finest. You want to justify giant robots fighting giant beasts? Then please make it so in a way not to sound so abysmal when the whole script is laid out on the table.Comic relief is a poor attempt to say the least. The only two ""bright minds"" available in the whole world act like Laurel and Hardy all throughout the film, reaching idiotic and blatantly obvious conclusions. They are nothing more than embarrassments for the scientific community and they are the perfect portrayal for how this movie treats its science.The film has its few moments to shine, but that's about it. They do not add up to something more. The story is too simple and it's told in an amateur way. Acting is bad not because actors fail to deliver a good performance, but because there is no performance for them to give. Directing is not good; fighting scenes are too pampered becoming over-saturated, and in other scenes it is almost absent. Music is the only redeemable quality of this title that I quite enjoyed. This is a high-budget triple A popcorn flick, but for me personally this film was a let-down. After all that hype and attention it received in media, I hoped at least that at the end of it I will get that smile, that u-mph that says ""Ok, this was a decent summer flick"", but alas, it did not happen.Even if you have low expectations like I had, you still might not enjoy this title, therefore I would recommend you not to go and see it, because you would only feed the hungry money making Hollywood machine and right now they need to realize that spewing out half baked films like this will not help them for the future. But that again what do I know? I'm just another random ticket-payer movie-goer, who wrote another review in a sea of endless reviews that are disregarded completely by the film industry.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Breathtakingly bad.,"I only have myself to blame. I saw the trailer and was seduced by the whole ""Giant Robots fight Giant Aliens"" concept, and Del Toro's record. But to say I was disappointed would be an understatement.I came very close to walking out. And the only other time I've done that is watching Adam Sandler's ""Don't Mess With The Zohan"". That's how bad it is.Visually, it's on a huge scale and is nothing you've seen before. It deserves some plaudits for that. Rinko Kikuchi put in a decent performance (at least when compared to her fellow cast members)But the poor acting, cringe-worthy dialogue, lazy characterisation, sad attempts at ""comic relief"", incoherent storyline and gaping plot holes do not make up for the cool effects. And to be honest, after the first 20 minutes or so, you kind of know what you're going to get for the rest of the movie.I know it's a big blockbusting summer popcorn movie, and I usually LOVE that stuff. But this was lazy. When 95% of your time is on the effects and 5% is on the rest, you're going to get a crappy film, and that's exactly what you get here.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great Special Effects But Little Else,"The problem with special effects films is that the special effects tend to dominate the story and the character development, but at the end of the day, it is story and character which make a film memorable. ""Pacific Rim"" is a classic case – great special effects overshadow a poorly developed story line and even weaker characters. One of the core problems in the film is that the main actor, Charlie Hunnam, who does such a great job on the TV series ""Sons of Anarchy"", just doesn't translate well to the big screen. It's not an uncommon problem (think David Caruso). His co-star, Rinko Kikuchi, seems completely lost, and most of the other characters don't have enough screen time for us to care one way or the other. Idris Elba, who usually turns in a good performance, can barely be understood, and Max Martini (""The Unit"", ""Redbelt""), another fine actor, seems to be sleepwalking.The comic relief, provided by Charlie Day, Ron Perlman, and Burn Gorman, are more ludicrous than funny.OTOH, the film does have some really impressive special effects, except for the ending, which appears to be shot in the pool of Director Guillermo del Toro. Del Toro directed the ""Hell boy"" (2004, 2008) films, which probably accounts for Ron Perlman's brief cameo. His best work has been ""Pam's Labyrinth"" (2006) which wasn't exactly an action adventure film, and his penchant for sci-fi and insect-like creatures can be seen as far back as ""Mimic"" (1997) which isn't remembered as a classic. Nonetheless he does a good job with the special effect sequences and they will keep you on the edge of the seat.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Brilliant homage to the kaiju and mecha genres, though lacking in some departments.","Cheesy, clichéd dialogue; bland, generic characters; bad acting on the parts of the lead Charlie Hunnam and supporting actor Idris Elba(the role would've been perfect for Samuel L. Jackson, like seriously); and a fairly predictable plot where gaps of logic abound; however, the movie is astounding when it's being what it's meant to be: an homage to Japanese Kaiju(think Godzilla) and giant mech films. While obviously a loving tribute to these genres by director Guillermo del Toro, it manages to be incredibly original with none of the monsters or mechs being clearly derived from any creations I've seen in the genres before(and each one having incredible and distinct designs, particularly on the part of the of the Jaegers). The action scenes are, as you can expect from a summer blockbuster, the main draw and are absolutely spectacular. Michael Bay, take notes, this is how you handle giant robot fights; not meaningless heaps of metal flying confusingly throughout the scene, but crisp, clear shots of brilliantly designed badass robots doing badass robot things. The monsters get plenty of credit here too, as they were absolutely spectacularly done. If you're looking for awe-inspiring, get-your-blood-pumping, edge-of-your-seat, hyphen-hyphen-hyphen, action, this is the movie for you. I will say, the few interesting characters got far too little screen time. Both Charlie Day and Ron Perlman had fantastic performances and I wish the two had more interactions, but it is what it is. Worst character award goes to Burn Gorman's character, but his portrayal his decent enough. Beyond the basic premise of ""Monsters attack earth, we build giant robots to fight them,"" the plot is fairly lacking. Some good character back story, and, again, Perlman and Day's subplot is absolutely lovely, but overall its predictable, uninspired, and has too many holes for my taste. But, again, the plot is second to the homage and action in this film, which is where the film truly does shine. Overall, I would strongly advise seeing this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Monster rise out of the pacific and are bent on destroying humanity. Humanity makes giant robots called Jaegers to fight of the monster threat before they destroy humanity.,"So I love this film, everything about it was awesome but I'm going to split it up into different areas, first I'll talk about the acting, then the story, then the fights and special effects!Acting: Overall it was good or really good, you have Charliee Hunnam as one of the main character: Raleigh Becket, to me he was like the guy from Tron Legacy but you actually felt for the guy, he had emotion and was believable in his role. Next you have Idris Elba who played Stacker Pentecost,and to me he carried this film, just the way he acted in every scene was brilliant! And the final main character is Mako Mori who is played by Rinko Kikuchi, I don't know her too well be she did a pretty good job in her role, and once again she was believable.Story: The story is going to be something you seen before minus the giant monsters and robots, A guy worked in a program bent on saving the world, he gets discontinued and then gets put back on the job years later. We've all seen something like that before, but what I thought was cool was the way the monsters come out of a portal in the Pacific Ocean, I've never seen anything like it. Overall the story is good.Action/Special Effects: So this is probably the main reason you've come to see this movie and man, does it deliver! Every action scene I was on the edge of my seat, with my jaw dropped in amazement! Watching these awesome CGI robots beating the crap out of giant monsters was a joy to watch! The destruction of this film is crazy, robots are punching through buildings, monsters are rushing through cities, destroying bridges and freeways. Every fight scene is awesome, and I like how each of the Jaegers had different weapons. For instance, one had a chainsaw sword, another had, like 4 arms with saw blades on each hand, another had rockets that came out of it's chest and shot missiles. Not to mention the special effects were top notch, everything looked so real! Del Toro really know how to make a good film, if you love his work or just love action films in general, this is definitely a must see!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Bad... Very bad.,"Bad... Very bad. Bad Acting, Bad Story, even the CGI effects which you would expect to be good seemed to consist of mainly badly modeled robots splashing about in a sea of Gray and blocks of concrete or cars flying about. I am guessing the effects were made to emphasize the 3D experience, unfortunately it only emphasized how bad it all was.As this is a mainly CGI driven film I have to compare the cgi with things like the transformer films which although not great films in their own right were nowhere near as bad as this turkey.I should point out I am an utter scifi/cgi fan but I watched the whole thing hoping that things would get better but they didn't, and sorry to say but this over hyped film really disappointed.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Exactly what you pay for, and then some.","When Guillermo del Toro set out to create Pacific Rim he drew inspiration from Francisco Goya's ""The Colossus"" and said that the he wanted to give the audience the same ""feel of awe"" in the battles between Kaiju and Jaeger. And he most certainly succeeded at that! This movie not only gives you some of the best action sequences any movie has offered up this year, it also delivers spectacularly in both the narrative structure, and characterization. The characterization is done primarily through ""the drift"" and it's inclusion is just a stroke of genius.In short, to pilot a Jaeger you need two pilots, since it is far to much neural interface for one brain to handle. These pilots need to be in ""synch"" so that their movements are matched. To get synced they literally have to meld their minds and then gain access to both the thoughts and memories of each other, and through great visual effects you learn a lot about your heroes simply by the movie showing it to you.Another thing that surprised me about this movie is just how well thought out most of it is. Kaiju priesthoods? Kaiju body parts marked? Science departments dedicated to the study of Kaiju? This movie has it all.With Pacific Rim, Guillermo del Toro not only gives you the best robot monster mash-up since, well, ever. He also shows just how much thought there has been put into this. Del Toro has made a concept that sounds stupid, into a clever movie. And in a well made universe, and with a believable structure. He also shows that a movie can still be simple, and clever at the same time. Pacific Rim is to me without a doubt the best summer movie of 2013, and i mean that not just as in entertainment value.This movie, is Awesome!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Waste,"I wish I could give this movie a lower rating. Everything is terrible, storyline, acting, cgi, everything.. Do not waste your time. I wish I had not. I do not believe there was any forethought into the technical aspects of the movie. Produced in an age of drones and wireless communication, why would there be a need for manual pilots that actually have to run in place driving huge mechanisms to control movement. Why would they 'feel' when the machines arm is ripped off. Why would this fight not be with nuclear weapons instead of trillion dollar bipedal robots. Why would you need to 'drift' two separate minds together to control one. Ever heard of Mechwarrior? Kids play that crap in their basements on a controller with two sticks and six buttons. What a damn waste of time and imagination. I wanted to like it, by the end I just wanted to say I finished it, and now that I have, I want my money back :(",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

You've most likely seen something very similar,"On the special effects side this film truly deserves a 10/10. Some of the fight/battle scenes are absolutely brilliant and they do make watching the film in a cinema worthwhile. The plot, however, is not that far from what you would expect from watching an episode of Power Rangers. The bad guys are coming; lets morph into some big ass robots and kick their asses. Not a *single* part of the plot surprised me a bit and I can truly say that this has to be one of the most predictable movies I've seen in quite some time. The acting isn't that great either but my girlfriend was quite pleased with two hours of Elba and Hunnam.To summarize: only watch this movie if you can be entertained by the special effects alone.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"The CGI was superb, pity the acting/story was awful!","I gave this movie 5/10 and that was basically for the CGI which was fantastic, best i've seen for a few years. It's hard to believe the story which was so simplistic and childlike at best was incorporated into a Guillermo Del Toro movie. A man whose imagination and direction are his genius clearly dried up for this release. Basically monsters from another dimension come through to earth and the world creates giant robots called Jaegers to fight them, yes folks that's it! The gaps in between the awesome fight scenes are filled by the most tedious dialogue and acting you could imagine. Charlie Hunnam who is English clearly has only one American Accent and OTT swagger and each scene he is involved in looks straight from Sons of Anarchy. Idris Elba got real plaudits from critics for this despite showing no screen presence or emotion throughout the movie. The most annoying character is Dr Newton (Charlie Day) whose high pitched screech of a voice provides constant ""nails on a chalkboard"" irritation in every scene he appears. It's clear Del Toro and team aimed this character as a crazy/funny genius but this fails miserably and he ruins every scene with his overacting screaming.Del Toro also had a brainwave that instead of having the English spoken Hansen duo (father and son) talk in their normal English accent for the movie he would have them speaking like Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins. Having saw both actors in other roles they don't speak like that in real life so much so as a Brit i could barely make out what they were saying. All of these problems wrapped around a poor script with no big name actor to carry the movie gave it a limited release 'B' movie feel. Had it not been for the truly awesome CGI, cityscapes and fight scenes popping up now and again this movie would have been a blot on Del Toro's resume. God only knows how they spent $180m on this.In a sentence, no superstar actor, 'C' class bit part actors managing to overact a poor script/story with the CGI saving it from total embarrassment.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Watched with mouth open,"Easily my most favorite movie in last few years. It's like Batman Begins of ""big fighting robots"" movies. Beats Michael Bay's Transformers trilogy on many levels. Actually it beats most of the latest ""invasion"" sci-fi movies on many levels. The movement of the giant robots feels very real thanks to the excellent visualization and sound mixing. The main music theme *is* present every-time when it's needed to build that feeling of justification and awesomeness and it's epic presence is appreciated by the little boy in me watching the monumental scenes with eyes glued to the cinema canvas. It's *maybe* not taking itself very seriously, and characterization is quite flat, but the ""threat"" still feels more serious than in movies with similar themes. I couldn't get rid of the wide *cheshire cat grin* on my face when I was driving back home. It was *that* good. Thank you Guillermo del Toro.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Warning- DO NOT under any circumstances, pay any extra money for this","Warning- DO NOT under any circumstances, pay any extra money for this movie. Not 7 dollars, not 3 dollars, not 1 dollar. But if it is free on demand, then you can pay for it. This movie is an absolute waste of good film stock that the producers made in order to ""make their nut"".There is no plot, no character development, no story and no rhyme or reason to it. The character which the black actor, Ilba plays, commander or the flight squadron, comes across as a handicapped idiot. The main 2 characters,Raleigh Becket and Mako Mori, appear to be in high school the way they relate to each other. I wouldn't even think this movie would be good for a fourth grader to watch. After all most fourth graders liked Star Wars, a movie which this film is far, far below. Maybe a first grader could watch this movie and take some benefit out of it.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Very entertaining,"When I see a movie I want to be entertained, that's it. Obviously it depends upon the material and type of movie, but lets get down to it, when you're going to see a good ol action flick, you just want to be entertained, see some good explosions and cool stuff and the goal is won.Now this movie? I've seen a lot of negative reviews and such and I'm struggling to find out where all the negativity stems from. Yes there are no famous characters in this flick, but it had a good story, good timing, awesome special effects and a great ending. BOOM!!! For the naysayers who say ""It's shallow"", or whatever, frak them... This movie is great and I think they are just defending something else that didn't quite make it.

Great special effects movie with a totally ridiculous story,"I have to say that I enjoyed this pure special effects movie quite a lot even though the plot is totally ridiculous. Clumsy giant robots beating at alien beasts with their fists should be better than modern tanks and airplanes with modern explosive and armor penetrating weapons? As I said, a ridiculous story. Well it does not really matter does it because the story gives an excuse for some real cool special effects loaded action. Giant robots and alien Godzillas in the same movie. Cool, simply cool.Once you have gotten past the silliness of the story it is a very entertaining roller-coaster ride of action. The scenes where the robots and aliens go head to head is visually very entertaining. Sometimes they make you laugh as well. For instance the scene where Gypsy Danger (the robot) drags a cargo ship after it to use as a club.Unfortunately a somewhat somber mood is set right from the start by the fact that the Jaeger program is discontinued. Not because they are really defenseless as the movie blurb states but because dumbass politicians wants to save money as usual.As much as the robot and alien action is tremendously enjoyable I think some of my favorite scenes are the ones with Ron Perlman as Hannibal Chau. I have always liked Ron Perlman and he is simply outrageously (as in funny) wacky as Hannibal Chau.The one thing I did not like with the movie is the ludicrous nonsense statements about the dinosaurs being the first attempt at an invasion. Whoever wrote that must be an idiot. Worse, the fact that it made it into the movie means that someone believes that the audience are idiots. When it then was followed by some green-religious crap that the atmosphere was not right but that we have now ""terraformed"" earth for them by our pollution it was at least a star off just for that. I hate it when they put crap like that in the movies. It is an insult to the audience.Anyway, despite the dinosaur nonsense I found it a very enjoyable movie. Without that it would have received a near top rating but as I said, it is at least a star off due to that crap.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Once the dazzling neon lights fades and the CGI effects are gone, there is nothing much left to call a movie...","I must admit that ""Pacific Rim"" was all that I expected it to be, but also all that I feared it to be. The movie is another ""Skyline""; all spectacular CGI visual effects and a shallow mockery of a storyline. Everything here just screams textbook step-by-step heroic story.The world is threatened by an extraterrestrial superior life form that comes to Earth through a rift in the depths of the Pacific Ocean. The nations of Earth put aside their differences and feeble politics to unite against this outer-wordly threat. And they build massive war machines that are driven by people to fight these gargantuan reptilian invaders.That was basically the entire storyline, and for some reason director Guillermo del Toro needed 131 minutes to tell a story that could have been told in one-third of the spent time.Right from the very beginning, you know the exact outcome of the movie, and there isn't a single surprise throughout the entire movie, which was sort of too much in a singular easy to be one step in front of the movie at all times. This was what the movie suffered from. Well, that and the appalling fact that the movie was a very weak excuse of a storyline.Which leads me on to the characters. The characters in the movie were actually more like caricatures than actual characters. They were wooden and had really awkward and often bad dialogue to work with. And the people behind these caricatures were doing alright jobs given the nature of the movie, but I can't really say that there was any one performance that stood out as being overly memorable compared to the others in the movie.That being said, then I will say that the CGI special effects in ""Pacific Rim"" is off the charts, and it looks nothing short of spectacular. The creatures were very realistic and moved about in a very believable way. Although they were a bit on the simplistic side in terms of creativity in the creature design. The war machines were nice as well, although I think the whole part about them needing two pilots to work in symbiosis was a little bit stupid.If you are looking for a Sci-Fi movie that requires absolutely nothing, and I mean absolutely nothing, from your brain, then ""Pacific Rim"" is a great way to spend 131 minutes in dazzling special effects, CGI galore and fluorescent neon lighting.I am rating ""Pacific Rim"" a 6 out of 10 stars, purely because of the CGI effects that is dazzling and a real treat for the eyes. This is indeed a movie suitable for a day where you are nurturing a hangover, feeling sick, or just need to lay on the couch with your brain sent away on holiday.

Easily one of the best for action this year!!!!!,"Well, Man of steel and star trek were quite big movies this year and I thought they would be the pinnacle of effects and storyline. Well DAMN!!!!!!! Pacific Rim has a well balanced story and Effects combo that carries you with it.The story takes it's time to build up but the movies starts straight in with action and grabs your attention straight away and you can't help keeping on watching to find out what the hell is going on. The comedy geeks were a good addition in my opinion deviating slightly from action and sad background stories.And the action sequences!!! Well they were pretty damn good to say the least. Picture a transformers fight where you can see every single move perfectly, a combination of wrestling and martial arts. If anyone remembers the power rangers zord mode, well the sync inside between the pilots looks the same but cooler and less cheesy.The acting was AMAZING!!!!! Idris Elba was perfectly cast to deliver those lines with a punch (couldn't help but think of him in Luther in some scenes!!)

It could be a sequel to a Godzilla movie never made (or, at least an ode to ""Destroy All Monsters""), and it thematically borrows from everything between Thunderbirds-Are-Go, Aliens, Transformers to Starship Troopers.The movie is an imaginative rock 'em sock 'em robots-versus-monsters amusement park ride: just enjoyable, dumb fun in an air-conditioned movie theatre for 2 hours - perfect for your inner 10 year-old.And it is pretty cool to see a robot punch a monster in the face.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
My heart rate was beating at like 150 beats/min from start to end,Such a refreshing action movie. Unlike many action movies nowadays that are based on well known comic books and books and we always know the story and the element of surprise is not really present. This movie however I went in with just seeing the trailer and omg hands down the best action movie I have seen in a long time. The story line was great it went into correct amount of depth and was not just action action action. It starts off with a great action scenes and then takes some time to build the plot. Then it goes into awesome action scenes and also had a great ending. Definitely worth watching in 3D. I know that this movie was filmed in 2D and converted to 3D for the theater. But because of all the large objects the 3D effect really made it seem like we were in the movie. Also the soundtrack was amazing for pumping you up.,10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A good robot/monster attack movie,"This is a bit of Transformers meets Alien meets Real Steel meets Godzilla meets Avatar. Aliens (who resemble the ones from Alien and Howard the Duck) emerge from beneath the ocean surface to attack coastal cities, and humans develop giant robots manned by two pilots to bring them down. After a defeat early on by our hero, played by Charlie Hunnam, this robot program faces elimination. And a rogue captain tracks down Hunnam (who's taken a civilian job) and attempts to save Hong Kong using the last of the robots. Hunnam wishes to team with a young Japanese woman, whom the captain cares for, but she has difficulty overcoming the emotions left over from the killing of her family during an alien attack.I saw this from the front row, and the 3D was excellent. I really felt as though I were going to get wet or hit with debris. The visual effects and look of the movie were excellent. Some of the charterization and script are problematic. The two scientists at the base are pencil necked, squeaky voiced comic relief characters and it's hard to tell if they're giving bad performances or the script just demanded that they act like cartoons. The soldiers, especially Hunnam, try so hard to be macho it's almost funny. He's concentrating so hard on looking butch, he forgets to act and his accent fades in and out. Nonetheless, I think if he becomes less self conscious about his acting, he could be a big star. He has a bit of a Brad Pitt look about him. The Japanese woman is a bit of a weak character. The audience is supposed to giggle as she coos around Charlie, and I suppose some people might think it's sexist that the only major woman in the movie is portrayed most of the time as being too emotional to be a pilot. Obviously, most people aren't going to a movie like this for the script and compelling characters. I compared it to Transformers above, but only because of the robots. One great thing is that I can always tell who's who, where the action is happening, and what the stakes are. In Transformers, action scenes go on for forty minutes and we aren't clear who's attacking who. There are some clichés during attack scenes, with bits of obvious humor thrown in. But generally I think this movie will win over most people. Definitely don't wait to see it on video. See it 3D in the theater if this title interests you at all.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Now I'm all for a bit of tongue-in-cheek action but unfortunately this movie attempted to deliver its paper-thin story all too seriously.The film actually features some good actors but the lines and plot they are forced to work with meant the whole thing felt like a series of low budget sitcom scenes spliced together with special effects fight sequences.In summary - I wouldn't waste your time.,1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I only recognized one actor so I saw some new people who were great, like Elba and Kikuchi.

An atrocious insult to my intelligence,"I would normally write an interesting and compelling review about a new movie that moved me enough to do so, but in complete honesty I must admit; this is actually the worst film I have ever seen. This film will always be the defining example of what happens when a production crew have a ton of money and technical skill, but no creativity or vision.Ten minutes into this movie, there are already enough plot holes and ridiculous and cheesy moments. The first issue arose when the narrator explained that to stop a threat which was previously dealt with by bomber planes, humans developed crazy technology, spend hundreds of billions of dollars, and trained thousands of people, in as a result, have a really big metal thing that they can hit the aliens in the face with. That's all.The biggest insult to my intelligence was when they insisted that because the robots are big, humans aren't capable of controlling them alone. It clearly did not occur to the writers of this film that this is simply ridiculous. These robots have the same number of controls and joints as real, modern day robots. The film continues with a never-ending list of nonsensical and dumb plot points with more holes than you can imagine.Previously, films of such low calibre have been underbudget too, but this atrocious waste of money that is Pacific Rim actually upsets me: those millions of dollars could have gone towards a programme to increase poverty in third world countries, and would still have been better spent.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great CGI-Fun.,"While lacking of a truly captivating story, Pacific Rim is a grandiose and impressive battle flick about giant robots fighting giant sea monsters in the style of Japanese Anime series that thankfully gets along (almost) without any pathos and exaggerated patriotism as it is often the case in Hollywood disaster movies of this sort (i.e. ""Independence Day"" or ""Armageddon""); since it never takes itself too seriously and yet refrains from being ridiculous or silly.This movie is especially made for the theaters, an experience of epic proportions that certainly must blow up the frame of your common flat screen TV at home. Therefore I highly recommend to see it at the cinema in 3D as long as it's still possible. The robots (Jaeger) are so big and heavy that, while walking, I had the impression that the floor, beneath my feet, was trembling with every step they made which of course came from the powerful stereo sound. The monsters (Kaiju) are simply huge and terrifying, you cannot tell where their bodies actually start like endless mountains of flesh. These two gigantic forces colliding with each other subsequently leads to (slightly overlong) battle scenes that are to be described as state-of the-art in terms of CGI effects and destructive frenzy being dirty, brute and swept with rain and pacific water; in its magnitude only surpassed by ""Transformers"" and ""The Avengers"" - a real ""Materialschlacht"" as we would say in Germany.With such a premise it's not surprising that the actual actors are more or less pushed into the background. Idris Elba has great charisma in front of the camera, but his role as the commanding officer is noticeably not very challenging due to a lack of diversity in character development which is maybe why he appears a bit stiff in his uniform. The same goes for the other actors who all appear somewhat pale with Charlie Day as a refreshing exception in his role as Dr. Newt adding much to the humor of the movie.The script itself seemingly paying homage to the Asian monster movies nevertheless missing their susceptibility to intransigence and craziness instead orientates itself too much on the usual Hollywood Blockbuster ingredients for success leaving you with the aftertaste that you have seen it all before one way or another (i.e. ""Cloverfield"", ""Godzilla"") thus being rather predictable.Guillermo Del Toro surely did better movies, however, with ""Pacific Rim"" he proved that he is able to maintain a certain standard which perfectly met my expectations albeit not surpassing them so that I cannot but give it a good 6 points out of ten.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"RIP Godzilla, RIP Transformers!!","Epic proportions, humongous creatures and larger than life CGI not new to Hollywood movies but Pacific Rim takes it to a notch above. I wanted to watch the movie for Del Toro whose Pan's Labyrinth was the one I watched recently which was brilliant. of course, this movie is at different scale altogether but still Del Toro manages to pull it of nicely considering how these mega movies can go easily wrong and lost in plot. The prologue is short and crisp which gives background and also more then the glimpse of these monster Kaijus and Jaegars. But you may think it plays spoiler if you expected dramatic entry of these creatures but it does not happen. Its definitely not the first of its kind movie, we have seen them before I wont say this is better scripted but yes, better visualized for sure as technology continues to make progress. As of performances, probably not too much was expected as it was not the focus but Edris Alba keeps it all together and kind of drives the entire movie. The two scientist characters though seem cheesy. The real heroes are the Kaijus and Jaegars which hog the limelight and the fights between them are well crafted and CGI is brilliant to go with the rather nice plot. At the end, as it happens in most of the sci-fi stuff, America saves the world and prove themselves as the guardians of the humanity!!

Failed cash grab by Guillermo del Toro,"I tried hard to like it, I hate being too critical of it, but even though it was an okay movie, its also easy to forget the next day. Unlike movies like ""Fast and Furious 6"", ""Pacific Rim"" gives nothing to talk about, no big action sequence or anything we haven't seen before. The movie is just scenes from other movies put together starting with the definition of Kaijus, kind of like the opening to ""Pulp Fiction"".Kaijus: Colossal alien beasts who rise from an interdimensional portal on the Pacific floor to devastate human cities.Thats all you need to know, there's not much to it apart from that, the movie is what you would expect. Transformers + Godzilla = Power Rangers... or in this case, Pacific Rim.I liked the cast, too bad they've wasted their efforts on making such a poor action film. Well, its actually not bad, but there's not much to it, it gave me the same feeling I got when watching Power Rangers as a little kid. I would watch it, then go run and play and forget I even saw it.Its also safe to say its definitely the loudest movie of the year, its just an average action movie that feels like a failed cash grab by Guillermo del Toro. It does have a few good moments though, like one unexpected death scene I don't want to spoil for anyone who hasn't seen it, but apart from that its just a wannabe Michael Bay movie.I'd recommend it to anyone who liked ""Top Gun"", ""Independence Day"", ""Pearl Harbor"", ""Transformers"", or ""Armageddon"".",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Coolant low,"I will keep this short: I was so surprised. I went expecting a cut above the usual action movie, but I was amazed at how terrific this was. The screen play seems to be a collection of virtually every war movie and monster movie cliché imaginable--all of which is obviously intended. It's like an intelligent and witty Transformers film, if you can imagine. The film does not try to be trendy and it avoids witty dialog, TG. The stock characters are given stock lines to say, and they do it perfectly. For example, the eve-of-battle speech.At first I was wondering if the director knew that the film was just one cliché, in-joke or film reference after another. There was no doubt that he knew, after I saw the ""Coolant Low"" warning.The 3-D and IMAX were distracting. When (not if) I see it again, it will be in 2-D, which is at least one dimension more than most summer action films lately.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The action is fun. The characters are bland.,"Guillermo del Toro aims straight for the big summer blockbuster with this giant robots vs. giant monsters (actually referred to as kaiju in the movie) flick. I have to admit, I find del Toro's films a little undercooked most of the time - I kind of wish he'd return to his earlier, simpler stuff like Cronos and The Devil's Backbone. Even Pan's Labyrinth, in my opinion, lacks personality. The big problem here is with the characters. The lead, Charlie Hunnam (the star of Sons of Anarchy), is about the dullest protagonist in recent memory. Idris Elba, who gave an all-time great television performance in The Wire, is quite boring. About the only two actors who register are Rinko Kikuchi - mostly because she's an adorable Japanese girl - and Charlie Day (of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, a show on which Guillermo del Toro once appeared as an actor), who brings the same manic energy he usually has, and perhaps comes off as a bit too much. Ron Perlman also has a nice little role, little more than a cameo. When there aren't giant monsters on screen, the film can drag. It mostly makes up for that, though, when the action starts. The good, old fashioned monster smashdown does not disappoint. I'd give it a slight recommendation.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Mediocre all the way!,"Just got back from seeing ""Pacific Rim"" and my worst fears about this movie have come to fruition! I was disappointed and underwhelmed! I wanted to like it, I really did and I really tried, but in the end I thought it was an O.K. movie that should have been and could have been great. While a cool concept and story, I thought the script was incredibly derivative and saw everything and every cliché coming a mile away. To me, the films biggest sins though are: THE MONSTERS – I thought the designs were bland, unimaginative, uninteresting and unmemorable. Can't remember what they looked like after I left the theater. THE ACTION – Every piece of action in this movie was shot and edited horribly! Horrendous stuffUnforgivable! More weasel on acid cam, more editing by a meth addict on speed, everything I have come to expect, hate and dread in the movies of the last 10 years. To spend most of your budget on special effects and not let your audience get a good look at things is wasteful and frustrating! You could have shot robot puppets on strings, whip panned all over the place and cut it like a coke fiend and saved 99 million bucks! I think that ""Robot Jox"" (Which was made for around 140 million less), was a much better and enjoyable giant robot flick, where you actually get to see what is going on!.

Must Watch Sci-Fi Action Adventure,Almost a great Movie-liked it really with the theme sets and the way soundtracks and directions fade in for the screenplay apart from the Monster and robot thing may seem to be childish to some still the way the movie theme in 2020 how Humans adapt to use technology wise as per the circumstances is well depicted. The way the action is choreographed is best even if its a robot fighting- The fights seems like more Human to a Monster and it was Stylish. Movie rating as per my thoughts is perfectly 8.5/10. The Storyline that makes the Human world to be almost responding to a catastrophe even though its strange from normal-the Movie is perfectly scripted. Sometimes have felt that instead of creating this as a sequel let this Movie remain as a legend or evergreen movie of all time and it perfectly deserves i guess.,10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Cheesy, annoyingly simple and utterly uninvolved. 2:2: Yet it fit the characters who were, cheesy, annoyingly simple minded and utterly void of any concern for any of them.3: In this world where every nation bonded together to use some seriously advanced tech to build these huge highly sophisticated jaeger (pronounced jagoff)fighting machines and the incredible tech needed to support,power, and operate them...everything else, and I do mean everything, is circa 1995. If you had an iPhone, people would bow to you as a tech god.4: Did I mention how annoying and cliché the characters are? Very, and I was thinking throughout the movie, ""why aren't they dying faster"".5: The various cause and effect used in this movie to ""move it along"" was some of the most dumbest I have ever witnessed on the big screen. The Government's conclusion and decision on the jaeger program, to set the stage of the movie, was beyond full retard, borderline obscene. I can't express how poorly the script, acting, directing and performance was. It was on the level of some action cartoon like pokemon or thundercats. GI Joe was a far better in every aspect.6: Instead of the world treating this as the apocalypse, just guessing since ""monsters from the sea"" are destroying cities and killing thousands and thousands...and it is just getting worse. The world treats it more of a WWE/MMA road to world championship. No, really...they do. Just ask the fishing industry.7: And seriously when you get down to it. Really big nasty monsters coming from the ocean to destroy mankind, and all we have is big bipedal robots that can't even swim or move, maneuver in the water?? Really? Not even an aquatic version to...you know...go out there in the deep ocean...where the monsters are coming from?",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Pacific Rim lacks intelligence, but makes up for it with eye candy and loud noises.","Be sure to check out my other reviews and entertainment posts on themovieboy77.comPacific Rim takes place in the not-so-distant future. Where Monsters (referred to as kaiju- Japanese for Monster) are mysteriously coming out of a portal in the ocean. The humans counter attack with huge robots (referred to as jaeger-German for hunter), run by two humans, by connecting their minds through deep secrets and memories so they could synchronize their attacks.The plot is pretty generic and the movie plays out like eye candy. It's easy on the eyes and very low on plot and emotion. You tend to not feel bad for the world because it just seems so easy for the monsters and the robots to destroy it. Obviously, millions are dying but who cares. We are basically watch huge robots and monsters fighting each other to the death ! What else is there that we should care about?I will not take away points from a mindless summer action movie just because it's all action and no depth but I just felt like I couldn't care for anything or anyone who was having bad things happen to them. There was no emotional involvement or enough of a back story for me to get involved emotionally.The actors seemed to be overacting at part and, at times, seemed to be very wooden. I'd feel worse for your character if you just showed me that you actually cared about what's going on. Charlie Day was fantastic as the comic relief. He plays a scientist who is an expert on the Kaiju. I believe Charlie Day is great in every movie he's in and his future is a bright one. You also have a very funny cameo from Ron Perlman, who you may know from Hellboy, who plays a black market Kaiju parts dealer. Rinko Kikuchi, the female lead, was also pretty bad ass. Although, through her intense emotional back story, you found it hard to care about what she went through. The characters don't react to it very well, which is disappointing because her story is the reason why she's involved in the project. Same goes for the lead, Charlie hunnam, who plays Raleigh Becket, who's emotional back story is the beginning to our story. After the beginning, you tend to forget what happens, as you are taken away through the epic battle scenes that take place.I must say, the action scenes were breathtaking and the CGI was just spectacular. I had chills every time a battle scene between the robots and the monsters was happening. Although, at times, it seemed very hard to follow as everything was happening so fast. I did see it in IMAX 3D, which made the experience enjoyable in terms of sounds and feeling, but didn't help the movie as the darker scenes were the scenes that were harder to follow, and more of the fighting scenes happened in the dark and in water. Rain and splashes from water seemed to have gotten in the way of the blows between enemies which made it hard for me to be completely blown away.Pacific Rim was your typical summer popcorn action flick. Lacking intelligence but making it up with visual eye candy and loud noises. Sometimes, that isn't always a bad thing. We expect this sometimes in summer movies. It's what we look forward to. For all of you thinking this is a Transformers rip-off, no need to worry. This is a smarter, darker take on mindless action. Not a lot of explosions or hot girls. Just something to have a little bit of fun with.Grade: B-",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Major flaws with the Kaiju,"Perhaps my feeble understanding of genetics and basic biology are at fault here, but I cannot overlook the contradictory logic behind the Kaiju. Shortly into the movie, thanks to Dr. Newton Geiszler (the Kaiju expert/groupie who had a ""neuro handshake"" with one of the monsters) discovers that all Kaiju have the exact same DNA; that the Kaiju are in fact all clones of each other, being created by other alien beings.If the Kaiju were clones with matching DNA, they would look exactly alike; however, no two Kaiju in the movie look alike. Secondly, if the Kaiju are essentially lab-created clones, a Kaiju pregnancy would not arise; however, this occurs in the movie as well.My last point: the Kaiju are amphibious ocean-dwellers, adapted with bioluminescence and crustaceous shells...so why would there be an overtly gorilla-esque Kaiju? If the Kaiju are so great at ""evolving,"" (which also contradicts the clone theory) how and why would there be an obese gorilla-crab? Even with my limited knowledge of biology and zoology, I know gorillas are not renowned for their swimming ability (and by that, I mean they don't swim...at all).",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Retro monster movie,"Guillermo Del Toro's ""Pacific Rim"" proves yet again that what was one generation's B-movie castoff is another generation's A-movie mainstay. It's a throwback to all those monster movies that played mainly in drive-ins in the 1950s - only here the budget is huge and the stop-motion and claymation techniques used back then have been replaced by the latest in CGI technology.In this 21st Century edition, giant creatures have broken through the earth's crust and are stomping all over many of the planet's largest coastal cities (see ""Godzilla,"" ""The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms,"" ""The Giant Gila Monster,"" etc. for the roots of these types of films). Humanity's response has been to create an army of giant metallic robots replete with two mind-melded human pilots at the controls (think of it as a WII version of a tank with arms and legs). Charles Hunnam, of ""Sons of Anarchy"" fame, is the hotshot pilot called out of self-imposed retirement - his co-pilot/brother was lost while on a previous mission - to help rescue the world. Rinko Kikuchi is his new partner with some unresolved issues of her own to deal with. Idris Elba, Charlie Day, Robert Kazinsky, Max Martini and Ron Perlman (I guess we know what the ""Anarchy"" boys were doing on their time off that year) round out the cast.The plotting is nothing to write home about, and there is way more jabbering, soul-searching and speechifying than is probably called for in a movie such as this - but the intense action scenes, bits of comic relief, and rally-round-the-flag-boys heroics help the popcorn go down smoothly.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Japanese pop art and American digital tech,"This is my first time to watch Guillermo del Torro's directions experience on high-digital movies. Watching Pacific Rim is like watching Japanese's robotic movies, despite of its technical performances. The origin story is quite original, coming from ideas of monsters coming under our world, human world and the emergence of a hero, very big hero, to destroy them. On the view of technical performances, nothing but big, huge, and robotics. I can't imagine how genius is Guillermo del Torro to manage his art team. But that's great job! Viewers can feel the feel of being a monster itself, being a big creature. That's why I can't recommend this film on DVD. My last review touches the story and actors. The story is smooth-shocking viewers, but the ending is romantic, as always :) On this movie, we find some new coming actors, but within them, there are several action actors, so we can also watch some actions as defined on our imagination. Thank you Guillermo del Torro!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Excellence, well done","At first,it makes feel it like the copycat of Japan Manga - Eva Evangellion: Zero.But at last i feel it had its own style to plot the movie. The director cleverly edited the ideas from Eva and make it become its own movie. It makes me unbreathable from the beginning of the fight against the kaiju. The visual effect of the movie is also well done. The kaiju seem nice and real.The story line is also well plotted. I feel Rei is alive when i see the role of Mori appears in the movie. The beginning and the ending of the movie is well established. I cant believe that I see Eva goes to the movie and no longer stay in the anime version. Finally, a well edited version of Eva Evangellion. Hope the second episode will even better than first. Great work, masterpiece of sci-fiction/ fantasy movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What summer blockbusters should be more like,"Pacific Rim is a film that doesn't try to hide what it is. An updating of Japanese giant monster movies that first were all the rage in the 1950s, Pacific Rim tells a similar story with the benefit of much higher-end visual effects than was possible on the lower budgeted events of eras past. However, Pacific Rim, unlike many Hollywood summer blockbusters, doesn't really skimp on other elements that make for a good film, with attention to character and story along the way. No one will mistake Pacific Rim as a masterpiece, but no one ever said being a blockbuster meant you had to be a bad film.Set in the near future, the Earth has been under constant attack by giant monsters, named Kaiju, that are emerging from a dimensional rift on the floor of the Pacific ocean. To combat the Kaiju, the governments of the world have built the Jaegers, giant, multi-story robots, controlled by two pilots who have melded their minds to prevent the mental strain of manning the Jaegers from turning their brains to mush. One Jaeger pilot, Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) gave up the program years earlier when his brother, who was his Jaeger co-pilot, had been killed in a confrontation with a Kaiju. However, since then, the Kaiju have become more dangerous, and the various world leaders have decided to put all their energy into building a giant wall to surround the coastlines of the Pacific from the Kaiju. Marshall Pentecost (Idris Elba) does not believe that will prevent the Kaiju from destroying the planet, so he and the four remaining Jaegers are assembled at Hong Kong to lead a final charge against the Kaiju to stop them once and for all. To man one of the Jaegers, Pentecost has brought Raleigh back into the fold, teaming him up with Mako (Rinko Kikuchi) to help lead the battle, but Raleigh's troubled past, and emotional scars of Mako's own, make the success of the mission seem dubious.Pacific Rim's screenplay written by Travis Beacham and the film's director, Guillermo del Toro, assembles elements that have been well worn in countless other movies. The earth under attack from menacing alien forces, the reluctant hero, the final desperate charge of a rag tag band of survivors, there isn't hardly any aspect that hasn't been lifted from somewhere else. So, while Pacific Rim won't get an A for originality, del Toro and Beacham do an impressive job of assembling the pieces into an entertaining, engaging whole. One key thing del Toro does right is to not transform Pacific Rim into an action orgy, like the recent Transformers films. While you can't accuse Pacific Rim of being without action, the film isn't a constant slog through an endless cycle of action sequences. There is attention given to setting up the plot, and also to establishing the characters and their relationships to one another. Pacific Rim's strongest example of this is the development of Raleigh and Mako's partnership, with more than a hint of romance lurking beneath. The two actors have a distinct chemistry, and that comes across in their scenes together. Like most good movies, Pacific Rim knows that without strong characters, everything else is just a lot of empty sound and images.When the film does provide its action sequences, Pacific Rim largely delivers. It's prime set piece is a large scene about half-way through set in Hong Kong and the surrounding bay. The action is exciting, well staged, and full of energy. del Toro crafts this sequence to maximum effect, getting the adrenaline pumping. Filmmakers that want to see how to stage large scale action should look no further than this major scene. Pacific Rim isn't exactly perfect, though. Two scientist characters, portrayed by Charlie Day and Burn Gorman, are intended to be comic relief, but their performances are so shrill and over the top, they quickly become annoying and off putting. del Toro also gives a small role to one of his regulars, Ron Perlman, as a Kaiju organ black marketeer, and while I always enjoy seeing Perlman pop up in anything, here he is largely filer, his character producing a smile at first, but, in the long run, not a very interesting role. Pacific Rim's ending is a bit underwhelming also, as the obvious parallels to other films robs the end of some of its energy. It doesn't ruin the movie, but a fresher conclusion would have been beneficial.Pacific Rim is the blockbuster Summer popcorn film that you generally wish more summer blockbusters would emulate rather than brain dead junk such as Transformers. By working in some nice character material, and allowing the film to breathe between action sequences, Pacific Rim manages to deliver a generally entertaining two hours at the movies. Its not groundbreaking or particularly deep, but for what it is, it delivers the goods.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
How was this awful movie made ??????,"I felt compelled to write a review on this movie, if only to save another human being from suffering through it.I find it almost unfathomable that someone or some studio fronted the makers of this movie almost $200,000,000. It could in my opinion have been put to much better use.It was a mish mash of every tired & clichéd hero vs villain movie ever made & I am more than surprised at Guillermo del toro for having anything to do with it.It is not surprising that not only has it failed to recoup the money pumped into it by the studios but that it is actually running at a significant loss.Don't get me wrong, I am a huge sci-fi fan but this trash is more fitting of the ""patriotic"" garbage that is churned out by Gerry bruckheimer & co.Save yourself the time, life is too short. I'm only sorry I can't give it a minus score.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Intense Sci-fi Action,"Pacific Rim has quite an interesting plot which was hardly seen in any previous Hollywood movies which involves a clash between huge creatures and robots controlled by humans. A viewer may experience few similarities between this movie and movies such as Transformers and Real Steel because of their inclusion of robots as focal characters in the movie.The cast behind the characters seem to be ideal especially the two main characters, Raleigh (Charlie Hunnam) and Mako Mori(Rinko Kikuchi), both in a mission of avenging the death of their family members, bring the movie alive to give an astonishing experience to the viewers.However the movie seem to lack punch at some crucial times including the end which is too mainstream as seen in many Hollywood movies these days.But, for lovers of action movies which include monsters and robots, Pacific Rim will be an all new, intense action pack which can keep the viewers at the edge of their seats for 130 minutes.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Entertaining but silly,"Sometimes I complain about critics butchering good and entertaining Movies saying it lacks this and that. I have Always pointed out that the goal of Movies is to entertain, but if you can convey a moral message or inspire someone to do something good...well that's fine too.Plot: skyscraper sized beasts of unknown origin attacks Earth forcing mankind to cooperate to overcome them. The result is mega sized robots controlled by a two man team.The storyline is so thin it is almost impossible to comprehend. Since I Watch loads of Movies I wouldn't say that story lines like this is super rare but Close enough.The acting is, well, not Oscar material if you get my drift and neither is the dialog. However, Idris Elba (Prometheus) is good as Always and it is nice to see Charlie Hunnam in something different from Sons of Anarchy.I had absolutely no expectations on this Movie and I thought it was just going to be pure Entertainment. And I was right too. But as Entertainment for the moment it works and the Entertainment is high class all the way, surprisingly so. I Thought the fighting scenes were pretty good and cool and it was what saved the Movie for me.What I would like to see more of in a separate Movie or wanted to have seen more of in the Movie is the theme of connecting to minds into one, I Think there is a good story for a Movie there.See this one if you like Transformers and Godzilla. Do not see this Movie if you are craving sophisticated Movies with depth or looking for a Movie to write an essay on.I give it 6 out 10 which is somewhat over the top, but the battle scenes and robots fighting beasts is pretty cool so...",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Stolen ideas from a lot of animes,"When i saw the cover of this movie i recognized similarities between robots from the anime ""Evangelion"" and the ones of this movie, i have to admit that was the reason of my interest in watching, but the more i watched more similarities from other animes i found.You can see the similarities on the anime ""attack on titans"" when you discover the kaijus are threatening the existence of mankind like the titans are, and also with the walls, in this anime the humans are refugees in big cities with big big walls. On ""bleach"" with the ""throat"", in this anime they have a portal that divides the two worlds called ""garganta"" it means throat in Spanish. On ""One piece"", the city where Franky come from is very similary with one on the movie, and finally, thats can be just a coincidence but, the name of the main character on attack on titans is Jaeger...The CGI's are really fabulous but removing the ideas that are stolen from the animes few it's left for the writers, and what they have done it's not the best one, the whole story it's just a bunch of clichés making the movie very predictable and sometimes boring.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Remake of Godzilla vs Mechatron (if such a film exists).,"Sometimes there are movies that pretty much have no plot but are still a blast to watch, and Pacific Rim is one of those movies. In a way Pacific Rim does what the remake of Godzilla pretty much failed to do, and that was to pay tribute to the original Japenese monster movies where huge creates come out of the ocean and begin wrecking havoc on major metropolitan regions (and Tokyo simply seemed to be a magnet for that). In a way if one could say that this movie was a remake then it would probably be a remake of Godzilla vs Mechatron (if such a movie exists).Basically huge monsters had been appearing out of the Pacific Ocean, and after wrecking havoc on a number of cities, humanity built giant mecha to do battle with them. However due to the fact that the human brain can not control a mecha by itself, they ended up designing them to have two pilots. At the beginning of the movie though one of the mecha messes us and they decided that they will scrap the program and instead build a massive wall around the Pacific Ocean.The problem is that the wall simply does not work, so they decide to go back to fighting the monsters with the mecha, and also looking for a way to block the hole in the Pacific Ocean from where these monsters come. Basically other than this there is really not that much deep to write about the film. Okay, there are the standard themes of the value of team work, and also the idea that somehow we can belay the apocalypse through some rather ingenious plans, or through good old fashioned self-sacrifice, but then one shouldn't really think too deeply about a film that is about mecha beating up monsters.Oh, yes, the film is set in Hong Kong, which is always a winner for me (as long as the film is a good film because there are plenty of films set in Hong Kong that are pretty ordinary, but this film isn't one of them) and it is pretty cool watching the mecha and the monster having a massive fight on Connaught Road in Central District (I love show off how I know the intricacies of Hong Kong). Oh, yes, I should mention that it is pretty slow going for the first half, but then when the monsters come out of Hong Kong harbour and the fight begins then, well, the gloves are off.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Terrible movie,"Poor script, even poorer acting and no sense of direction throughout! The problem with this film is that the characters just aren't believable and you need some credibility to pull off an action yarn like this. For all its faults, 'Cloverfield' held my attention much more than this tired effort. I watched it with my 17 year old son, who gave up on it about 1/3 of the way through. I must confess that I almost followed him as the first half has very little going for it as it tries desperately to make us care about the characters (and little else). The two scientists are the least believable of all and I got seriously annoyed with the both of them! It picks up a little in the second half but not enough to pull you back in. All in all, a tired, boring, noisy mess. I'm amazed that the film is so highly rated by others here. Oh, I almost forgot; the CGI is passable but only just. It's destined to be forgotten!",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great film.,"One of the best films I've seen this year. A unique blend of Japanese mecha and kaiju that pays homage to those films, Pacific Rim is a film that not only dazzles the senses, but it's also a human story at heart and that's the most important part of any film that has the fate of the world hanging in the balance with epic battles at the forefront. I found this film MUCH BETTER than the Transformers films. Though those films had epic action scenes, the big difference is that you can ACTUALLY see the action; no quick-style-MTV-ADD-riddled editing. The action flows organically along with the story, which is both exciting, fresh, and well-acted. Some of the characters were underdeveloped, but the leads are impressive with great performances throughout.Pacific Rim is one of those films that simply make you say, WOW!!! A really fun time at the movies and a nice change of pace from the gritty blockbusters in theaters now. I hope they get a sequel going because I'm really excited to see what their gonna come up with next.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Ignoring some annoying moments - extremely FUN to watch,"First of all, Pacific Rim is one of a few movies that is worth watching in a movie theater. Special effects were good, both the robots (a.k.a Jaegers) and the monsters (a.k.a Kaiju) were well polished and looked realistic. The action went on and on leaving me squeezing the chair waiting to see how it's going to end. So - special effects: check; action: check. These are most important things that an action movie must have for the viewers to have a good time.However, the biggest problem for me was the whole 3D thing. It just doesn't work for me as well as the old 2D. Just like in the Avengers it was ruining the movie for me to enjoy it at it's fullest. You simply can't notice little details that make the movie so wonderful. I must mention that the acting wasn't so remarkable either. The dialogs were short, but at some parts completely unnecessary. It wasn't very noticeable since it's an action movie so people came to see giant robots fighting giant monsters and how delightful it was for everyone to get what they wanted.I don't know what's wrong with adventure and/or action movie creators, but it seems like they can't leave out cheesy jokes out. And what a big deal they make out of it - the joke scene must be emphasized even if it's very short it can't be a minor. Of course one joke isn't enough, when I saw the first one, I smiled a little thinking - yeah, it was OK, after a while, the second joke was forced in the movie and... I don't know, I just facepalmed. Perhaps I'm just making this too much of a deal, but such little things sting me like a bee.Another small thing that made me frown was that a little bit more thought in underwater sound effects could have been put. I mean come on, creatures that can walk the surface and roar, can't just scream underwater. Also the plot is kind of predictable, but not all of it! At some point I decided to take sip of my drink, apparently it was very bad timing, because at the same moment an unexpected jump scare-like scene started and I spat the drink on my knees. My point is that you know what the characters must do, who lives and who dies, how the movie is going to end, but you don't know how they are going to do it. I hope that sentence made sense.So, Pacific Rim is worth watching in a movie theater simply because it's so beautiful and full of action with no secret puns - just robots vs monsters. Some moments are indeed annoying, but they were nothing compared to the excitement that I felt afterwards.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"So much action and still so very, very boring","I saw this with a couple of 12 year olds and they were apparently as bored as I was. Given the hyper story line and massive protagonists, you would think there would be some excitement. Think away, just imagine it and don't bother seeing the movie because the editing makes the action almost incomprehensible. That big thing hit that other big thing and oh my, the big thing there is going to come around fast....there you go, battle sequences described in almost as much detail as you see.Central characters you don't really care about, cardboard cutout scientists and two of the worst Australian accents in recent cinematic history also didn't make it very engaging. I mean really? No Australian actor could do the job botched up by those on screen? I don't believe it for one second.So, dull as dishwater, big and loud, not engaging for 12 year olds and those with a significant amount of years under their belt... not much more to say, except perhaps to say, again, save your money and don't bother.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The movie is corny for sure but it's an awesome kids movie; fanboys should be more than pleased!,"'PACIFIC RIM': FIVE STARS (OUT OF FIVE)Director Guillermo del Toro's sci-fi action film about a future where the world is taken over by giant sea creatures and humanity's last hope is to build giant robots to fight them. The robots are controlled by two pilots who must merge their minds together through a neural link in order to control them. Del Toro uses this theme as a metaphor for how we all must come together in life (accepting each other's flaws and differences and utilizing each other's strengths and empathy) in order to survive and live in peace and happiness. The movie is corny for sure but it's an awesome kids movie with a lot of heart and fanboys should be more than pleased.The story is set in the near future when a portal is opened, in a crevasse beneath the Pacific Ocean, which leads to another dimension. It unleashes giant monsters into our world, called 'Kaiju', which quickly wipe out millions of lives and destroy much of our resources. All the countries of the world unite together to fight the monsters and develop a technology they call 'Jaegers', which are giant humanoid robots controlled by two pilots. The pilots must link to the robots, through a neural bridge, in order to control them. This proved to be too much for a single pilot so two pilots are required to control the robots and must neurally link together, through a process called 'Drifting', in order to do so. 'Drifting' allows the pilots to see into each others minds, and learn the other's deepest and darkest fears, in order to better cooperate and control the giant machinery.The film focuses on one pilot, Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam), who loses his brother (Diego Klattenhoff) while 'drifting' (during a 'Jaeger' battle with an extremely powerful 'Kaiju'). The trauma of the event forces him to retire and the world continues to decay as the 'Jaegers' become less and less effective in battling the 'Kaiju'. The worlds governments eventually give up on the 'Jaeger' program and terminate it. The 'Jaeger' program's commanding officer, Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba), isn't ready to quit just yet. He comes up with a plan to end the war with the monsters once and for all but he needs Becket to help him carry it out. Becket reluctantly agrees and teams up with a test pilot, named Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi), to pilot his old 'Jaeger' (which is named 'Gipsy Danger' and one of only four remaining 'Jaegers'). Mako is very close to Pentecost and has a tragic past involving the 'Kaiju', which causes complications when 'drifting' with Becket. The two must overcome these problems and work together as the 'Kaiju' become an increasingly greater threat. A geek scientist, named Dr. Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day, of 'IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA' fame) also becomes intricate in Becket's plan to stop the apocalypse.Del Toro directed and co-wrote the film (with Travis Beacham, who conceived the story idea). Together they really have created an amazing world. I love all the detail and passion that went into creating it and think it really paid off well. Their $180 million budget really went to good use as the film looks spectacular. It's like a beautiful live action cartoon and you really can't go wrong with giant robots vs. monsters (the action scenes are unreal)! It's everything I loved about the movies when I was a kid (this movie would have blown me away). The acting is great (Elba is always too cool, Kikuchi gives a passionate and very strong performance and I could watch Day for hours in a role like this) but the star of this movie really is Guillermo del Toro. He's really outdone himself here. I love movies but I especially like the nostalgic ones that really bring out the kid in me. This is one of those movies and I can't give it high enough praise.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P84p-Ba6JbY",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
JaegerMeister,"I Love Guillermo Del Toro. the man has a twisted imagination, he makes some very incredibly scary Monsters. From Mimic to Hellboy II and Pan's Labyrinth, he's been scaring the Bejeezus out of us for over a decade. And we keep coming back for more.He even had a small hand in the creation of Peter Jackson's ""The Hobbit"" - And in a way I am glad that Guillermo did not direct that, as he said that making Pan's Labyrinth almost killed him, I think The Hobbit would have been too much for him.But Pacific Rim was not - And he did it, Del Toro did a GOOD JOB on Pacific Rim.I think what people do not realize is how much of himself Guillermo Del Toro puts into his movies. A Lot of work, and a Lot of Love.So when I first heard of this movie a few years ago, I was not sure I understood what it was to be about - And I was correct, you cannot easily quantify what kind of Movie Pacific Rim is. Is it a Monster Movie? Yes. Is it a movie about Giant Monsters? Yes. Is it like Robot Jox? YES.So what we get is a cross between Robot Jox and Robotech - Men Piloting Huge Mechanical Robots, which are Man's Only Tools to fight an enemy which puts man on the scale of an Insect under these enemies' Boots- Er, Claws, Er, Appendages.And so we get to see the level of destruction from the first frame of this film, and not only the use of Huge Robots, but we are told about ""The Drift"" - Two Minds merged together through the Machine, two men working as one, Is this a Love Story? In all ways, this is a Love story between Mako (Rinko Kikuchi) and Raleigh Beckett (Charlie Hunnam). But it is also a love story between Raleigh and his late brother Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff) - And also between Mako and her Surrogate Father Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba). And between the Father/Son Team of Herc Hansen (Max Martini) and Chuck Hansen (Robert Kazinsky) - And finally even love between the oddest of odd couples ever: Doctors Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day) and ""Gottleib"" (Burn Gorman).Why? Because all of these people have shared ""The Drift"" in some form or another.""The Drift"" is not only a technical solution which allows two Pilots to Merge into basically a single Brain, Left and Right hemispheres, for Piloting a Jaeger - It's also a Gimmick created by Guillermo Del Toro to help us understand the relationships between these people.And this gimmick works better for that than strictly as a means for two Pilots to drive a Jaeger.Through this Gimmick, we understand Raleigh's loss of Yancy. We understand the antagonism of the two ""Scientists"" Gottlieb and Geiszler, antagonism peppered with healthy respect. We understand Pentecost's protectiveness over Mako, as we see through her eyes how she perceived her Savior Pentecost when she sees him for the first time as a little girl holding one red shoe.It is Pentecost's Final Words to Mako which has a bittersweet ring to it: ""You can Always Find me, In the drift"".And when he says this, we KNOW, that he is not going to be dead, that he will always be there in Mako's Mind each time she relives that moment where she sees her Knight in Shining Armor arise from the Cockpit of a Jaeger.It is not just the digital imagery used to portray men fighting huge monsters, Digital Imagery which succeeds rather than fails on all kinds of levels - But it is the Imagery Guillermo has created- This WORLD he created and has given to us, to either live in, and enjoy with him, or to not bother- This fantastic Future Landscape which holds enough Future Shock to kill 1,000 Alvin Toffler's - THIS is what has been given to us with these images- And the way the Digital Images are blended with the practical Film effects, so we do not know where one ends and the other begins.In fact, one documentary I had read from, describes that the Kaijus were designed as if they were to be like the suits worn by Men in old Godzilla Movies- And in fact the way the Kaijus Move are very much like ""Men in Suits"" - Only that I have heard Guillermo talking about creating large monsters in other films, particularly in Hellboy - that he animated the ""Sammael"" daemons so that the movements were more like Animal Movements- He did MUCH the same here with the Kaiju Movements.But I am glad I bothered to watch this film - It has taken me a whole month to think about how I would write this review. It is because of the deep Humanity which this story shows us, love and respect, that I choose to respect it's director for.Because on top of all of these deep Human and Spiritual aspects of this story, Guillermo has given us a nonstop event filled with action, and when the Pilots get into their Jaegers, we get into the cockpit alongside them. And when Raleigh falls into the Rift with the carcass of the first Category-Five Kaiju, we fall down that rabbit hole with them, and when we see the Leader of the Invading Aliens, and the FEAR in his three or four Eyes, we can REALLY see that fear, and this makes that moment much more satisfying for us as viewers and participators in the story.Guillermo Del Toro is much different than other directors of today. Even here we can see his earlier efforts as influences - And one thing I know that Guillermo always carries around is his Notebook.Thank you Guillermo, and I'm still waiting for Hellboy Three!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Extremely fun, but it's noisy and already seen","Guillermo Del Toro is back. And I was thrilled. What's he up to now? A film about giant robots and monsters fighting each other? That's cool! But wait a minute. This doesn't even sounds like Guillermo. Let's check it out. The movie itself, is actually a mixture of anime inspired robots and monsters, Godzilla, ""Robot Jocks"" and ""Independence Day"". You put all that in one big oven, and you get this noisy thing. I think that film was mostly inspired by anime films just like Robotech, or Macross Saga, that kind of stuff. And really, action scenes, were high voltage, over the top and I was really impressed. The story is set in 2020, where, in the deepest parts of the Pacific ocean, a breach is opened and from it, a massive, extremely large aliens, called Kaiju merges out to take over a planet ( the part about taking over is very much like in the Independence Day). So, humankind develops a 'Jeager' program. The program consists of a piloting a colossal robots to defeat monsters. It really sounds cool from the first moment, but when you see the film that's everything you ever saw before in Japanese, or US monster film, only this have far more outstanding special effects.OK, let's start with the basic stuff CGI is excellent, no complaints here. Music score is good but, it's overused in the scenes, where the music is not even required and it's too dramatic at some points. Writing is a cliché the same story over and over, about a skilled pilot who lost his brother and he asked by the general to go back and help him the usual stuff. Good editing, good camera work, very well in fighting scenes. Well, this movie offers only good fight scenes. The props were good, the robot and monster design was badass, the interior design of robots and their robot base was good. The suits were very much like the one from ""Dead Space"" Isaac Clarke, anyone?Now, the actors. Charlie Hunnam well, this role was easy, so he didn't do much with his character. He is a typical hero that needs to face with his demons. Don't get me wrong, he is a solid actor but, he didn't do much here. Idris Elba is one of the best actors in the film, and he was good, but sometimes, he was from flat to explosive performance. And his character was pretty predictable. Rinko Kikuchi was new to me here, and she did a pretty good job. We got Clifton Collins Jr. he was OK, and we have Robert Kazinsky (best known as Warlow from True Blood), who plays an a-hole pilot with the cutest bulldog ever. And those two scientist my God, the worst characters in the film, they were just yelling at you and the camera, they were so annoying. And we have Ron Perlman, who obviously got stuck in his Hellboy performance, and his character was an a-hole not far from Hellboy Del Toro maybe wanted Perlman here to look like Hellboy, because he was wearing a red pimp-like suit and well, only the golden shoes were an exception.So, I do recommend this film, it's pretty enjoyable and it takes away those two and a half hours pretty fast, but don't have to much expectations because it's a déjà vu film and that makes it crappy.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Destroy all Monsters!,"It is my sincere hope that this movie proves to be a huge hit, because that will mean we'll get more live-action anime adaptations from Hollywood! Why do I say this? Because Pacific Rim isn't a direct adaption of any one particle anime series, but rather, a homage to the entire genre as a whole. And all of this from the man who brought Hellboy to the big screen, no less!That said, the Human element in this was a little weak, the romance felt a little forced, and some characters felt too large for life. Case in point, in a movie that features 300ft robots and monsters duking it out and wrecking entire cities in their wake, the only element that felt really too excessive was Charlie Day's performance as the science fellow. The whole effect, ultimately, was the feeling of a comic book, but then again, this is exactly what the director intended, and exactly what we, the viewer, should expect.As you may have guessed by now, I'm a huge geek for anime, manga, kaiju films, and Japanese culture in general, so this movie was everything I could have wanted, and then some! That is why I encourage you all to check it out! In the mean time, I'll be biding my time until another Japanese monster star makes a well-earned and highly anticipated return to the big screen next year. Until then, this is ugyenpeljor signing out.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"With nothing new to add, it does it's best.","From the intro titles of Pacific Rim that sweep in about ten minutes into the movie, the dance-style soundtrack shows just what kind of movie Pacific Rim is going to be.Or rather, what it ought to be.The film's action is spectacular, as it's battles between giant robots and Godzilla-like creatures are chaotic but clear and precise. It's nice to see a movie with clear fight scenes these days. The movie delivers entirely on the action front.On about everything else, it stumbles.The movie consistently fights with itself whether it is a serious action drama or a comic-booky cheese-fest. There are moments where it is obvious that Del Toro is winking at you but the very next scene contains attempts dramatic dialogue from a dreadfully written one of two main characters. One of the most regrettable pieces of dialog occurs when the main character says ""But Gypsy Danger is analog!"".Although I must admit that I am very partial to Charlie Day and the It's Always Sunny camp, the attempted comic relief relied entirely on the body movements of Charlie Day and Burn Gorman because of the weak script.Pacific Rim would have been much more successful and enjoyable if it solely stuck to being a cheesy comic-book film rather than become a predictable and weak attempt at drama.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The worst 'summer blockbuster' ever made,"I don't mind big budget summer blockbusters. These days I expect a brainless CGI fest. It's not like we can expect a classic like Jaws or Jurassic Park anymore, but I'll admit I was mildly entertained by the likes of Godzilla, Armageddon and Transformers.Pacific Rim on the hand is just awful. It's like watching Power Rangers. As good as the CGI was at one point I was convinced I was watching actors in rubber/metal suite fight over a miniature city. In fact it's like watching those old Japanese Godzilla movies, but nowhere near as good (and they were bad).It was painful watching this. The acting is horrendous. And just when you think it can't get any worse, it gets worse. I honestly can't even remember what any of the characters names were and I only watched it 1 hour ago.Honestly I feel sorry for kids if this is the future of Hollywood blockbusters. I can't believe we've gone from the likes of Jaws > Jurassic Park > Armageddon > Transformers > Pacific Rim. Talk about a downward spiral. How can it possibly get any worse? What's next?",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The best summer film!,"I had seen the trailer dozens of times and with each time I wanted to see the film more and more. It wasn't a let down! It's absolutely stunning, even the monsters are beautiful(in their own gruesome way). The director Guillermo del Toro did a fantastic job! The acting and the effects are amazing. I loved the details that were put into the film(rust on the Jaegers;chipped paint on their Jaeger suits,so on). My favourite Jaeger is Gypsy Danger(a bit too obvious,eh?). Another thing I love about the film is the unique way of showing aliens. The aliens are obviously from another planet but they come trough a portal that is deep into the ocean,they are intelligent despite how they look and above all they clone themselves and send clones to do the ""dirty"" work. They are truly unique. I strongly recommend it to anyone who loves robots and monsters and the everlasting battle between good and evil.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great special effects but infantile,"As ""science"" fiction this is infantile. Like the new Star Trek, and Terminator Salvation, Battleship, and many others, the special effects are great but the plot and the acting make this a ""real life"" comic. There is no effort at all to offer a plausible basis for the plot elements. The entire movie is an insult to the intelligence, but it looks good. I guess that's what it takes to rake in the big money these days.The characters are shallow, spoiled, egotists who try to be larger than life heroes but end up looking like reckless children let loose in a toy factory. If these are the best humanity has to put up against its enemies, it makes you want to root for its enemies.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Only children could survive this unrelenting barrage of clichés & embarrassing dialogue.,"Adults will find this movie quite unbearable. There is absolutely no effort put into story or character. Rather, what the film presents is an unrelenting sequence of horrible clichés & embarrassing dialogue...which briefly interrupt one boring robot-fight scene after another. It is absolute torture.Children, on the other hand, are inoculated. They don't have the experience or intelligence required to feel the pain this movie insists on bringing. They will be distracted enough by the visual stimulation - & appreciative enough of the strained obviousness of each scene.It has been a long time since a movie wilfully refused to bridge the gap between these two audiences.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Summer Sensation,"Don't judge a movie by other movies. That basically sums up what I have to say about Pacific Rim. In all honesty when I first heard about this movie I had no intention of seeing it. I immediately thought of a Michael Bay wannabe try to do what he does with a million explosions and no story. I thought giant robots mindlessly fighting Godzilla Cloverfield monsters were stupid. After actually seeing it I can gladly say I was wrong.Was Pacific Rim a mindless violent movie perfect for summer? Kind of, the action in this movie was state of the art. Let me get that out of the way. Seeing a giant robot punching a monster in the ocean was fun. The destruction wasn't over the top either. I was also concerned about the frequency of the action and surprisingly it mixed in well with the story. There was a very good balance between the fighting and the story with the humans and understanding the monsters. There were three of four real fight scenes with monsters and robots and the four scenes were so worth it. They were also really well placed and spread out. There wasn't action scene after action scene. There is one in the beginning, another smaller one or two in the middle, and then the incredible ending.The major concern was the story for me. The acting didn't have to be superb and it wasn't but it was better than I expected. Jax form Sons of Anarchy is the main character and he does a good job but I can't help but think he plays the same guy in everything. There was a scene or two where I saw Jax on screen and not the actual guy. The story itself if basic and is explained in a prologue in the first few minutes and that was probably the best part of the movie. I was glad the movie started in the middle of the war. It was a smart movie in my opinion because the beginning if the war wasn't as important. There was still enough time do dive into the characters and fall in love with them.Charlie Day is in this movie and although I don't think he fit the movie he was a strong addition. He plays an entertaining scientist who studies the monsters and trues to understand them. This was another interesting part of the story I found interesting. This was strength and the biggest weakness. The story was a lot better than I expected but it was rushed. His character and his story were really rushed. He does a few things and meets Ron Pearlman, and he is also awesome in this movie, then he does something else, and then he figures out the big question, thin the movie ends. I wish there was more time spent on the story but then again that would have taken away from the action that drew the audience in.The most interesting part of the story was the robots themselves. In the beginning we learn they were created solely to fight the monsters. The fact that all the world leaders came together and with the technology built these robots quickly. I didn't really buy that 100% but it was something I had to look past but these things are operated by two humans and their better the relationship between the two people, the better the robot it and the better it fights. Wow, awesome, did not see that coming and I loved that. If somebody tried to pilot the robot by themselves their mind basically explodes. It is too much to handle so touché to the movie, I enjoyed it. It adds complexity to these robots and it was awesome. This brought in the aspect of character relationships which is super important in any movie.The relationship between Jax and the Asian girl is strong and necessary. I wrote this review long after I saw the movie so I can't remember names. Anyway, their backstory is really cool something I enjoyed. The flashback with her as a little girl with the monsters attacking was emotional and impactful. The main relationship was between the girl and the general. The general is the best actor in this movie and he does the best job out of anybody. Every leader has a memorable speech before the final battle. I loved Bill Pullman's in Independence Day and in this movie it was good in the moment but by now I can't even remember what he said to make everybody cheer.Overall, Pacific Rim is a good movie with a fair balance of action and story. I saw this movie because people raved and were so excited for it so I had to give it a shot. I went in wanting anything but Transformers and I left with a big smile on my face. It is a great summer blockbuster and is a popcorn movie. It is a good way to spend the day. When it comes out on blu ray I will buy it and watch it with my friends and enjoy it. Other than that it will sit in my cabinet and be watched every now and then. The movie did its job so I give it the WillyT Honorable Mention.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Entertaining, but like most summer blockbusters, it rings hollow","Let me start this review by saying that I am in no way familiar with this genre of film. That being said, I am quite familiar with Guillermo del Toro, and I have always admired his ability to emotionally attach the audience to his characters. In his previous films, like Hellboy and Pan's Labrynth, the audience was equal parts captivated by the human elements of his characters and by his visionary approach to CGI. Walking in to Pacific Rim, I was expecting something along those lines; a movie with beautifully crafted special effects with delicate attention to story and character.Unfortunately, this film is much more traditional in its approach to being a summer blockbuster. As per the usual, it doesn't waste any time building suspense or developing characters. By the end of the first minute, we've already seen a massive Kaiju destroy a city. How this Kaiju came to be there is glossed over in a 30 second monologue. To me, I would've preferred a more detailed explanation of such things; already it seemed apparent that the story would take a backseat to the CGI.And that's pretty much how this movie went. The story and the characters within it are all flat and boring, and are portrayed by clearly uninspired actors. Not enough time is given to the story; all of the time (and budget) has clearly been allocated to the special effects.Now, I see several people fiercely defending this movie, and they are all saying that people shouldn't see movies about robots fighting aliens if they expect a top-notch story and some inspired acting. This defence just doesn't work for me.It might sound so far like I hated this movie, but I really didn't. It is an average summer blockbuster, nothing more, and the only reason I am disappointed is because arguably one of modern cinema's better directors is at the helm.That being said, this film does do one thing right. When the Jaegers and the Kaiju clash, the results are nothing less than spectacular. The scope of these fights is quite unlike anything I have seen in rival blockbusters, and was a real treat in 3D.The key to enjoying this film is to expect a simple blockbuster movie with some serious eye-candy. Don't make the mistake I did and expect anything more.RATING: 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Simply Scrumptious,"Pacific Rim recipe.Sieve a handful of Transformers into a bowl and stir in a dollop of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.

great,"This is an absolutely magnificent movie! I have seen hundreds of films and this movie is only the 6th that I have awarded a 10/10 to. All this year, I had been anticipating the release of Snyder's Man of Steel, with Pacific Rim coming in at a distant 2nd for my ""Most Anticipated of 2013"" list. Not only was this movie better than Man of Steel, but I am now prepared to say it is one of my favourite movies of all time! Not being impressed by Del Toro's Hellboy, I was a bit anxious when he was directing a movie about giant robots fighting aliens, but my fears were aside with an impressive first trailer. Ever since its release, I have always considered Transformers: Dark of the Moon to contain the best action in any movie (say what you will about Michael Bay), but that has now been figuratively shat on by Del Toro proving that there is a healthy middle- ground between heart-pumping ""mindless"" action and the making of a great movie. Giant robots fighting enormous aliens - it's not just for meth-heads anymore... Incredible film!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Mega details transcend the expectations and comparisons,"I rarely write a review by solely narrowing down significant elements that make the movie so special and stand out. But, as ""Pacific Rim"" which is subliminally forced to put in an unexpected competition for reviving childhood memories of those who grew up watching Godzilla or Transformer, when it is merely made to give us an entire new perspective about ""How to defeat Monsters if they really happen to attack earth."" So here it goes, it rocks harder than all the present monstrous movies because1. There are detailed and logical explanations for the origin of the monsters that let you not only experience immersive and inconceivable scenes but comprehend the story without being perplexed by sloppy settings.2. Massive details on robots aka Jaegers unleashes the magnificence of their luster, mechanical textures, and operational systems that were created by stunning Visual effects and efforts of stunts.3. Again, there are tremendous details on monsters aka Kaiju that not only it looks realistic but possesses jagged skin with frightening body structure that can easily threatens even a giant 250-feet tall robot.4. The movements and actions during the battles are wonderfully depicted without shifting too fast which often results us in confusion for ""Who hits who? or How does it that happen?"" You can vividly enjoy spectacular motions that occur in both city and ocean environments along with dynamic camera angles.5. Every character play the role with vehement passions. I agree with some of the lines and expressions being quite shallow and cheesy. However, if compared to emotional relationships and conflicts between characters that this film offers, the acting part can be forgiven as no other counterparts have as much scientific explanations and a compelling story as this one.It is so mega from the intro to the end.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pacific Rim: The Giant Monster Movie of 2013,"Preface: I will not spoil the movie for anyone interested in seeing it. I will provide my opinion on the overarching plot line and general scenario as well as the acting before giving the movie a rating and a recommendation.INTRO:Set in a slightly futuristic world, Pacific Rim in a ode to many of the giant monster movies of the past. For those that remember watching Godzilla versus Mothra, or any of the other hilariously metamorphosed creatures from the creative Japanese minds of the late 1950's and 60's, will feel drawn into the sci-fi world of Pacific Rim. The setting changes from various locations on the Pacific coastline during the film until a final stop at a base in Hong Kong where most of the film's action takes place.ACTING:Animation aside, the acting was surprising good for a film that was less plot and more fight scene. The cast was full of unknown names to me. The sole recognizable face was Charlie Day or Charlie from It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia. He plays a PhD biologist who isn't afraid to remind people he's a doctor and is interested in learning all he can about the Kaiju. His character is very spastic and full of energy, which reminds me very much of Charlie from Always Sunny. This obviously shows the role wasn't too much of a stretch for Day's acting chops.The lead male role is played by Charlie Hunnam (who upon further investigation stars in Sons of Anarchy, never seen it) who is one of the Jaegar pilots. Charlie's character Raleigh (yep like the city) is a gifted pilot, one of only two pilots to ever be able to operate a Jaegar by himself for any extended period. Charlie plays the role well, interjecting his positive attitude wherever possible (most of the time in the middle of a fight). Raleigh loves to fight and often acts without any idea of self worth when in battle. He is your typical hot shot, selfless hero.The female lead is played by Rinko Kikuchi (never heard of anything she's been in). Her character Mako Mori is also a Jaegar pilot. She goes through an internal, emotional struggle related to the Kaiju and her childhood throughout the film. Overall, her acting is good and she gives enough to have you buy into her character even though much of the plot and motivation of actions by and towards her are questionable. I'd give more about her character, but it would be revealing too much of the plot and ending of the movie.TAKEAWAYS:Overall, if you're walking into the movie to see a visually appealing, monster flick you're in for a treat. If you're looking for any logical plot line or strong character development go see none of the movies currently in theaters and pop in the Se7en DVD sitting in the stack next to the TV.This is a movie that if seen at all should be viewed in the theater. The visual experience of a home TV diminishes the major redeeming factor that Pacific Rim has: the ability to captivate and immerse an audience in a visually stimulating environment.The rating that follows take into consideration the entirety of the movie experience. I would recommend anyone moderately interested to go see Pacific Rim, but the rating reflect the movie in comparison to movies as a whole.RATING:The film gets 3/5 Chuck Norris thumbs ups.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Disappointing,Unfortunately I expected too much from this movie. Main reasons for my disappointment: The characters are too simple and easily psyched especially when it comes to the two professors (Dr. Newton Geiszler & Gottlieb). The enduring fights between them are flat and listless and become very tiring during the movie.In my opinion many of the actors could do a lot better. Best examples are Ron Perlman or Idris Elba who we know for better acting. Their roles are not deep enough for high performance acting anyway.The Story is weak and very predictable. There are too few surprises and no suspense at all. Good example is the story of Mako Mori. Viewers easily know what is going to happen and what her part in the movie will be.From my point of view they just stringed many special effects together to distract from the simpleminded storyboard. In total the movie seems to me like a cheap copy of transformers mixed with a cheap copy of Godzilla.I would not recommend it at all.,3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"THE Greatest C.G.I. Spectacle in years... The last time I was this impressed by Visual Effects was in 2009, AVATAR!","Oh boy... Oh boy... Oh boy... Where do I begin? The problem with having very high expectations for a movie is that the higher your expectations are, the greater the chances are of you being disappointed. When I saw the this movie's trailer for the first time, a few months ago, I was in awe, and by the time I walked into the theater the last night my expectations had only increased, multi-fold...So, did it live up to my expectations, was I impressed? Hell Yeah! As much as I will ever be... So much that, to me, this movie proves that Guillermo del Toro is the master of Epic (Visual Effects) Grandeur. The only other movie whose visual effects impressed me this much is 'Avatar'.The story is basic (but good nonetheless), the movie is of moderate duration, and the screenplay is precise... So there isn't a dull moment in the film. There isn't a weak link on the acting front either, Idris Elba stands out though. The background score by Ramin Djawadi deserves a special mention. But finally, as you can see from the trailers, this movie is all about epic, grandiose scale visual effects, the kind you've never experienced before.

Giant behemoths dealing punches, superimposed over general population, produces a feeling of wonder and awe that, I'm sure, del Toro captured unerringly. Adrenaline powered speeches and last minute heroics really made me feel like child again. I had the whole cinema cheer and boo at the screen on various occasions, and the demographic was from 3 to 93 years of age. Feeling is similar to Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" through out.

"Two loud hours packed with CG, rampage and fighting","... And that's pretty much it. In the first minutes of the movie the whole story is so quickly summed up that it makes you wonder if it was something the editor felt he should throw in a couple of hours before the first screening. And then there's little left of a story to tell after that, so the easy solution is, of course, a lengthy bombardment of intense monster-mash- robot-high-tech extravaganza. In addition to this, it doesn't really have much potential to be a movie that you remember for being very distinct (giant monsters trying to destroy the world, mankind desperately defending itself, etc). And as for what the characters goes, You hardly remember them by the time the credits are done. There's no time to bond with them in any way between all the fighting scenes. If you can't really bring yourself to care about whether the monsters or the humans win in the end, you know something has gone wrong.

Best Live Action/CGI Film,"I created an account on here solely because of some of the negative reviews that the movie had received in regards to the producer using this movie as his ""personal fanboy playground"". I find it hard to believe that anyone could not enjoy this spectacular movie, and find it disheartening to see that it's beaten in the office box.I didn't know what to expect when I walked into the theater today. I hadn't really watched the trailers with any particular interest, and the only reason I came to see it was because I'd heard that GLaDOS would be voicing the computers in this. I'd been slumped in my seat, expected to be bored (because of the title), but I was blown away the moment the movie began. I definitely did not expect to see what would carry on throughout the movie, a spectacular sight to behold.There's such a variety of aliens in terms of design, and it really brought me to the edge of my seat, squealing like a fangirl at all of it. The robots were great as well, bringing with it the fiery love I have for the Transformers movies. The human characters themselves, I came to like as well, despite my resilience for liking any human character in a live action film. I felt for them during scenes, and adored the portrayal that many of the actors/actresses nailed on the spot. They came off to me as people that I could see in real life (namely the two scientists).I didn't see any lull in the movie whatsoever. I was constantly drawn to the screen with things that I love. I saw/thought of many references throughout the film, which made it more pleasing to watch as I could relate back to those things. It's like a giant conglomeration/fanfiction crossover. Aliens, Transformers, Real Steel (though I haven't actually watched it yet), Evangelion, Godzilla, Hellboy, Portal (this is the most prominent one, and the one that drew me to the movie in the first place), 2012, and much more. I don't see why anyone would give this movie less than an A unless they were asking to be the bad cop in this reviewing scene.And I'm not stopping at one viewing. I can't wait to see it multiple times, both in normal and 3D, over the next two weeks. It's not a movie that you can see just once. There are so many things to see, and this glorious movie deserves all the attention it can get.Best live action/CGI movie I've seen since Transformers (I'm talking about the CGI on this one, because I don't care as much for the script). I'd say this is my new favorite movie, and I don't play favorites easily.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Monsters get ready,"Guillermo Del Toro goes 'Mecha-Anime' harking back to the Japanese Kaiju films. It's Godzilla monsters causing mayhem in an updated way.Less cheesy than the Transformers films, in fact maybe a little bit too po-faced here and there. Del Toro delivers enough action, mayhem and destruction in Pacific Rim.The plot is generic. The film is set in the 2020s, when Earth is at war with the Kaijus, colossal monsters from a dimensional portal on the floor of the Pacific Ocean.To combat the monsters, humanity created the Jaegers; gigantic humanoid mecha's each controlled by at least two pilots who have initial success but the monster keep on returning stronger than ever.Piloting the Jaegers we have standard characters such as a cocky operator, a plucky rookie and a burnt out maverick with bad memories of the past. They put the their differences behind them and learn to work together as the threat the planet face intensifies. Idris Elba is the one who is in charge of them all.There is comic relief from two bickering scientists and more zaniness when Ron Perlman turns up as a gangster.Del Toro provides some added cheese to go with the action and a little depth as well. A few plot holes but the film is still enjoyable fun.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
too stupid to watch,"This is a very stupid movie. Its based on a stupid idea that a stupid director stole and tried to sell to a stupid audience. Thankfully, the majority of the audience is not stupid enough to pay to watch it, so there won't be a sequel.This is one of those movies where actors spout garbage while standing in front of green screens. There is no character, no plot, no suspense and no humour.Of the element that was supposed to sell the movie- the fight scenes- they seem to take place in bad visibility, suggesting that the special effects weren't up to snuff.this is a movie for people who thought that the Green Lantern didn't have enough cgi and that the Seth Rogen version of the Green Hornet was too intellectual.

It could be so much better with some logic.,"Guillermo Del Toro is a good director, but he seems to be learning too much from Tim Burton instead of forging his own path. I really liked some of his films, especially ""Pan's Labyrinth"", but this film, despite its merits, has nothing to do with that and doesn't even seem to be from the same director.The best thing about this film is the extremely high production values. Visually, the film is amazing and it's really nice to watch. We've got great visuals, stunning cinematography, and an absolutely immersive dose of high-quality CGI. In addition, the film has very well-made sets and costumes, thought out in detail and indisputably expensive. The special effects department, despite all the computer graphics used, also had a series of good opportunities to show its value, and it never failed to do so. The editing is good, the cuts are barely felt and the pace of the film is extremely pleasant. All good reasons to see the film, which was a great blockbuster.Director Del Toro, I have no doubt, had the courage to take a risk on a film that looks like nothing I've seen of him. However, and as I said, he is good, he is creative, and he is a perfectionist in his work, assuring us of an impeccable job in this film. The cast has great actors, and all of them were at the best level. Idris Elba is, for me, the most notable and the best of them all, but I also appreciated the efforts of Rinko Kikuchi and Charlie Day. The worst performance came from Ron Perlman, but this is largely due to the poor conception of the character, who is a crude caricature of a common drug dealer with no taste. Charlie Hunnam, honestly, was an actor that I completely missed. I felt that not only did he lack the charisma and ability to hold the audience and be the protagonist, but he also lacked the skills for the task.I deliberately left the script for the end because, for me, this is where all (or almost) of the film's problems lie. The script is based on an alien invasion of Earth: coming from the bottom of the sea, aliens take the form of gigantic monsters, forcing the entire planet to unite and create metal monsters capable of breaking their faces. The first problem is the illogicality of these premises: how and when did aliens arrive in our world, and how could they penetrate the Earth's crust? This is not explained, nor how countries funded the construction and maintenance of such metallic machines, nor how they manage to walk and fight in an ocean as deep as the Pacific. How did they withstand the heat of the planet? How did they withstand the pressures on the ocean floor? The battles against the monsters almost always take place in the coastal area next to the big cities, threatened, in a clear allusion to films like ""Godzilla"" or ""Transformer's"". The dialogues also lack any kind of authenticity. The movie simply makes up for it all with tons of action.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pacific Rim Review 2013-08-04,"Worldwide Gross 3 weekends $293,361,000. Caught this awesomeness at the IMax @ World Golf Resort just north of St. Augustine:Unbelievably Incredibly Top Form for Guillermo del Toro. This flick blew my cerebellum thru the roof into the stratosphere. They story made the action scenes mainly concerning the Kaiju & Jaeger, in between scenes we learn that it takes at least 2 human souls in order to pilot a Jaeger so in between the immense action we get very well written characters each having a story I was interested in finding more details about. Well worth the trip to see this in IMax + 3D. The action sequences were shot in native 3d while the interactions and backstory scenes were all done in 2d so this also fits perfectly. Easily and seemingly effortlessly stands tall and above any and all action movies especially in the last 5 years. The effects implementation is characteristically above current top notch as del Toro is known for doing. The story and characters had me wanting more and thinking of how this could set up so many possibilities. The fact that the massive expansive environments which energized the all out action scenes are equally as interesting due to the handling of the characters expansive back stories and emotional facets elevates this wonderful result from the entire film crew involved really testifies to what a well crafted cinematic experience can be and the magic such a passionate creation may invoke.An adroitly conceived and executed work of cinematic artistic innovation. A new bar has been set and it's made by Jaeger!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Excellent.,"First off I want to start by saying that anyone who refuses to accept or challenges the concepts of mind melding and giant robots is purposely disregarding whatever story world the movie is set in.The technology used in this movies world is fan fiction for the lovers of Mecha Anime. Gundams, Evangelions, Laganns all relied on the pilots mind as well as skill which is fully represented in Pacific Rim.I can agree with people questioning the methods used to fight giant aliens and most people would assume large caliber weapons from distance rather than close combat but remember this is a world that invested trillions into a robot fighting force lets all pretend its a great idea...also remember it worked wonders for humanity until larger monsters started to break through.Character progression was rather dull the pilots generally don't all agree with one another. In a Hollywood film you're stuck on rails anyways so the love interest, father figure, jerk, and clueless scientist are all present and overall done well considering they are designed to be those characters not reinventing the wheel.The combat, Devastation and unique art style all gave this film an incredible environment. In full 1080 on a big screen surround sound you can start to think this is what a Gundam movie might look like if Americans embraced it.Sadly most people who watch this film will be turned off by the worlds technical settings and obvious attempts to recreate Japanese anime. Fact is North Americans are not exposed to that media and are not familiar personally I found this movie to be excellent. Forget about how a robot could stay submerged with hull breaches, forget the fact that the machine can get tossed around and the nuclear core doesn't blow, hell forget about the fact that the aliens didn't just open more rifts and send the whole army.Its an excellent experience if you want giant robots fighting giant aliens with huge explosions and flashing lights.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A Spoiler-Free Review of ""Pacific Rim""","As a kid growing up, a lot of the times during the Summer I would get bored with no one else around to hang out with. I mean, what else does a film obsessed kid do when he's bored in the Summer? Well, he makes a movie of course. However, what type of movies? There were no other kids around in my neighborhood to use as actors, so I made monster movies. Some of the times these movies starred our cat, but seeing as how living creatures were more difficult to work with, most of my monster movies starred a marionette creature or stuffed animals, with action figures playing the human roles. There were no scripts, just my imagination literally making everything up as I went along with our Hi-8 video camera in tow. All of this to say, I've always loved monster movies, and Pacific Rim may just be one of the best, if not the most original monster movies ever made.What makes Pacific Rim so original is that it mashes up two Japanese film genres, those of the giant monster and the giant robot, and creates a movie that is unlike anything that Western audiences have ever seen before. Pitting giant robots versus giant monsters was a genius idea that I wish I had come up with, and screenwriter Travis Beacham deserves huge kudos for coming up with the idea. The thing is though, this film wouldn't be worth watching if it didn't manage to have more going for it than just giant robots and giant monsters. Beacham and director Guillermo Del Toro go beyond that simple idea and actually have created likable characters and an involving story to go along with the awesome spectacle, and that's why Pacific Rim should be considered one of the best monster movies ever made.If you've ever seen any Godzilla movie or episode of Japanese animation (i.e. anime) featuring giant robots, then you will recognize all of the character types that exist in this movie. Pacific Rim is really like anime brought to life in live action, and if this movie can achieve such believable results, then can a live action Mobile Suit Gundam movie be far behind? One can only hope, but for right now, as a fan of anime and Japanese entertainment, Pacific Rim manages to introduce American audiences to all of the Japanese film and anime tropes that many of the kids in my generation have been in love with for our entire lives. However, I don't want anyone reading this who has never seen any anime or previous monster movies to think that this movie is not for them.Pacific Rim is really a movie for anyone who just loves a good time at the movies. It's fun, action packed, and is emotionally involving. Unlike so many Summer blockbusters that take themselves too seriously, Pacific Rim manages to balance the humor with the seriousness to create a lighthearted adventure film that still carries weight and consequence through the character's actions, but you're having a blast while the world is literally on the brink of destruction. Guillermo Del Toro treats this film as if it's like a propaganda film from the WWII days, where he's idolizing the pilots of these giant robots, trying to inspire humanity with hope and optimism to actually rise up and meet the monsters rather than getting crushed under their feet. Of course, I'll reiterate this point, had the characters not have worked, neither would have this movie. The characters and their relationships with one another are what gives this movie dramatic heft when it most matters, to where when we reach the action, it's not just mayhem for the sake of mayhem, it actually means something.In case you haven't noticed, I loved Pacific Rim. Few movies are this imaginative and this much fun, and that's the main thing to take away from this movie. From a design standpoint, this is one of the more meticulously crafted made up worlds I've seen in recent years, and that is a testament to Del Toro's gifted cinematic eye. The action is stand up and cheer awesome, thanks to amazing FX work from Industrial Light and Magic. As for the characters, none of them would work if the actors playing them weren't so likable, from Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, and Charlie Day, to the emotionally vulnerable performance from Rinko Kikuchi, they're the ones that actually make us care about the story. Bottom line, this isn't another Summer blockbuster trying to play off of post-9/11 fears and anxieties, it's literally a movie about the goodness of humanity and the power of the human spirit to work together when it's most needed, and who doesn't want to see that?I give Pacific Rim a 9 out of 10!",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
All Style No Substance,The Good: Some of the best special effects in recent memory. CGI effects are beautiful and seamlessly integrated with actual footage. Fight scenes are satisfying. The scale of the battles felt authentic.The Bad: Very thin plot elements. Characters are shallow and not developed well (despite the screenwriters obvious efforts). Nothing to make you care about the battles or their outcomes.Conclusion: This movie looks great but is easily forgettable. There is nothing of substance to make you really care about this film. It's worth seeing on the big screen but I would recommend the matinée price if available.,6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pathetic Power Ranger Movie,"This movie is bad. I do not know how could anybody rate this movie higher than 3. 3 is a good rating for this movie. So lets start: characters are pathetic, story is lame and full of inconsistencies, combat scenes is ridiculous. I will not mention CGI because nowadays anybody could do that. OK, if you are a 5 years old kid move could be great, but for all others (5+) is a insult for intelligence. Any episode of children series Power Rangers is better than this. I like SF so that is only reason i rated this movie so high as 3. There is many games, comics, cartoons with big robots and it is sad that no one could write good screenplay and make a decent movie. In a last decade only thing that matters is CGI, so make bad screenplay with a lot of CGI, make a good trailer and here you go. It is too bad that no one really cares about a story.

Really pretty bodge,"This could have been amazing, but there are too many plot holes and pointless detours for it to fulfill my (not very high) expectations.Not only does del Toro show no real understanding of what it means to be ""Pacific"" (culturally, geographically, in terms of the space or urban landscapes), he manages to conflate pretty much all of Asia into one gigantic stereotype - and those Australian accents were so bad I almost walked out!At the end of the day, there were a few passingly good action scenes, and a couple of almost- brilliant moments of apocalyptic doom, but the lack of believable (or interesting) characters (and the fact that 3 of the male leads looked almost identical), paired with the absence of any engaging settings (most of the battles are in the ocean), make this a fairly sub-par offering.And did I mention that accents were really, really terrible? With the lackluster performances from Martini and Kazinsky (a Brit and an American), you could have hired pretty much any Australian guy off the street to do better. And why are Aussie characters so often mean and have bull-dogs? Being stupid and having bull mastiffs would make more sense - or being stoners with an old collie or a cattle dog. But vengeful and competitive, with a British bull- dog? Nothing good to say about those two characters, at all. Waste of time.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
am I getting too old?,Maybe I am getting too old. This is absolute drivel. Had so many Hollywood movie clichés I was cringing through out the whole film. I would love to go into depth about what I mean but it gives away pretty much everything that happens in the film but if you have seen top gun its pretty much that. Also it has one of the biggest movie plot flaws right at the end of the film that I just cant get out of my mind. Hollywood also tends to either make a brit in the film a villain or a complete cretin. Point and case in the form of Burn Goman. He was great in Torchwood but in this he was a dithering fool that I can only assume was put in there as comic relief that never worked.Idris Elba though was the stand out performance for me with an outstanding scene were he put down the hero so it wasn't all bad. The fight scenes were also pretty good and not as much as a mess as the transformer films were you cant tell whats going on as one robot melds into another. There was none of that here. It was good old mech on Japanese creature porn. So if they release it on DVD just edited down to the fight scenes id buy it. but leave in the story which is just top gun sci fied up a bit and the terrible acting I wont be sad if every copy is burnt in a fiery blaze by Godzilla's cousin.,6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
'Pacific Rim' does what it promises with a great sense of fun,"At first glance, 'Pacific Rim' may seem like Guillermo Del Toro selling out – it's his first blockbuster with a budget shy of $200 million, featuring giant robot battles. However, this film is no sell-out; it is clearly a Guillermo Del Toro movie, maybe not as much as 'Pan's Labyrinth' or 'Hellboy' were, but a Guillermo Del Toro movie nonetheless. It is possibly his most personal – he said one of the reasons he made was ""to reconnect with his inner eleven year old"", being inspired by all the Kaiju movies he marvelled as a child.The film opens with a narration by the protagonist, Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) chronicling how giant monsters (Kaijus) emerged from a portal in the Pacific Ocean and began to destroy cities. In response, mankind developed giant robots (called Jaegers) piloted by two people to destroy them. Now, with the threat worse then ever, Jaeger commander Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) calls Raleigh back into action so that they can ""cancel the apocalypse"".'Pacific Rim' might not be as deep or nuanced as some of Del Toro's previous work, but as a giant monster movie it's faultless. You want giant robots hitting giant monsters? You got it. The action sequences here are some of, if not the best, the Mexican filmmaker has directed, they're easy to follow, beautifully staged, exciting and most importantly, great fun to watch. When hero Jaeger, Gypsy Danger, pummelled a Kaiju with a large ship, I couldn't help but smile. And that's one of the best things about the movie – it is pure fun from start to finish, making a nice change from the dark, brooding blockbusters that are around today. It has a light tone with some silly humour (courtesy of the zany scientist duo) and a lovely cameo from Del Toro regular Ron Perlman as Hannibal Chau (continuing the film's line of brilliantly-named characters).Sure, you could criticise the film for having one-dimensional characters, clunky dialogue and a thin plot, but when said film is so exuberantly fun, these things don't matter one bit. I was always engaged with the characters, rooting for them as they battled the Kaiju, despite the fact that they weren't exactly original creations. This is undoubtedly helped by the fact that performances are solid all-around, particularly Idris Elba who makes the often cheesy 'call-to-arms-speech' rousing. As pure entertainment, this is one of the best films of the year so far, it's a Kaiju movie that also looks and feels like a live- action anime film. Robots vs. monsters? 'Pacific Rim' does what it says on the tin and frankly, that's enough.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
THE robots killing aliens movie!,"This film will go down in history as ""that robots killing aliens movie"". It's just so epic. When I first went to the cinema I was really sceptic. I thought it's just a movie created to make lots of money, because of special effects.Turned out I was wrong. It wasn't about the effects, it wasn't about the fights, it was much more. It will be something you will remember after a few years. It will be something you will watch again and again.There is something for everyone. For the geeks - beautifully designed robots and the monsters were very interesting, unique and familiar at the same time. Epic battle scenes with much details, looking realistic.

"Basically a collage of clichés, full of shallow dialogues praising the need for union, overcoming and heroism, ""Pacific Rim"" impress and it's saved because the visual effects","Written by Del Toro himself in partnership with Travis Beacham (not coincidentally responsible for the script for the remake of ""Clash of the Titans""), the script already starts by throwing the viewer into the middle of the action by explaining that a mysterious rift created at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean it works like a portal that, from time to time, allows the passage of gigantic aliens who are responsible for destroying entire cities with incredible ease. To face the threat, the world unites to build giant robots that, controlled by pairs of soldiers mentally linked to each other, try to contain the growing threat. Commanded by Marshal Stacker (Idris Elba), these warriors include the valiant Raleigh (Charlie Hunnan), traumatized by his brother's death in combat, and the determined Mako (Rinko Kikuchi), who fights to earn the chance to guide one of the robots and avenge the death of his family.Guillermo Del Toro, who also worked on the script, doesn't waste much time detailing the origin of the monsters. Using a somewhat dull but necessary off-screen narrative, we hear Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam, from Sons of Anarchy) talking about the near-apocalypse and how the Jaeger saved the world. And with that, we're immediately thrown into the action, with Raleigh and his brother Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff) piloting Gipsy Danger against a monster. Arrogant and self-assured, the brothers are beaten like a thief and, along with the announced tragedy, comes the downfall of the Jaegers. The Mexican director pilots the film with the certainty of the Becket brothers, but completely without arrogance. He knows that the material is basically a collage of clichés, but he also knows that not every cliché needs to be worked on carelessly. Your exquisite attention to detail.It is, as is easy to see, a fanciful idea, but one that - thanks to Del Toro's intelligent and ambitious approach - even gains a certain dramatic weight by evoking the threat to the future of humanity represented by the invasion of monsters. Thus, while Michael Bay's Transformers sound like confusing and boring nonsense, ""Pacific Rim"" keeps the viewer always involved by creating long action sequences that, in addition to being understandable in their mise-en-scene (something that Bay seems incapable of create), differ from one another even through the setting of conflicts, which can occur at sea, in cities, in the air or at the bottom of the ocean, also involving different and growing strategies and risks. Benefiting from a spectacular production design (trademark of the director's productions), the feature already succeeds in portraying the robots as machines clearly worn out by use and time, showing stains, scratches and defects in their bodywork, which immediately gives them a surprising verisimilitude. Furthermore, while the Transformers (sorry, but the comparison is unavoidable) move excessively fast, denouncing their digital nature, the Jaeger (as the robots are called here) move heavy and slowly, which - even though created by computers - suggests mechanical and, consequently, more realistic effects. Meanwhile, the monsters surprise with their diverse appearances, which range from sharks to dinosaurs, often hinting at their alien natures through subtle details like fluorescent lines that run through their bodies or multiple eyes that exhibit an inexplicable glow.In the same way, ""Pair of Fire"" devotes immense attention to detail to the rest of its universe, from the gigantic complex that houses the troops and robots commanded by Marshal Stacker to the overpopulated, neon-laden Hong Kong that serves as the setting for much of the second act of the projection. Of course, here and there, the visual effects become more obvious - and the first time Raleigh enters the complex, for example, it's easy to tell from actor Charlie Hunnam's movements as he walks on a moving walkway in front of a green. Screen -, but these moments are relatively rare, since most of the time the film impresses with its scale and the competence of the effects. Meanwhile, Kate Hawley's costumes are adept at suggesting the characters' personalities subtly (Clifton Collins Jr.'s controller's conservative suspenders) or more cartoonishly (Ron Perlman's gold shoes and velvet suits), while whereas the photography by Guillermo Navarro, Del Toro's regular partner, well explores the dark mood of the night sequences, leaving to bring a bright and cloudless day only when it serves a clear narrative purpose.Incidentally, the drawings of gigantic beings and machines lend personality to elements of the cinematographic composition. What Del Toro does is what Shawn Levy did in ""Giant Steel"" in a way. We care as much about inanimate beings as we do about the huge monsters that populate our screens. We know their names; we twist and vibrate as if they were human characters. And the same goes for the soldiers, scientists and smugglers we see on the scene. They are all basically one-dimensional, with unique and specific functions within the plot, but even so, Del Toro works angles and cameras focused on their faces so that we live what they live. In a rough analysis, Raleigh would be just another bully who thinks he's invincible, but Del Toro, when casting Hunnam for the role, had one goal: to humanize the stereotype. The same goes for casting Idris Elba in the role of Marshal Stacker Pentecost. He poses, gestures and speeches straight out of cardboard characters, but the framing, emotion, intensity and shred of backstory and speeches (""Today, we will cancel the apocalypse!"") that Del Toro and Elba imprint on the character, end up taking it from the basics and turning it into something truly memorable.The pair of scientists, Dr. Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day) and Gottlieb (Burn Gorman), are comic reliefs that Del Toro uses to the limit of reason, perhaps going a little further. The two actors work well in their antagonistic roles, almost like two of the three Stooges, but in a film that no longer takes itself seriously, their presence could have been cut here and there, especially since the tip of the always great Ron Perlman, as the smuggler Hannibal Chau (another sensational name, isn't it?) is already worth all the comic relief the tape needs. Deserving credit for being a rare action film that does not hesitate to bring a strong female character - and whose gender is never pointed out by the companions, making her strength something even more natural -, the feature is populated by creatures that, although not exactly complex, are embodied with such commitment by the great cast that they become engaging and memorable figures. Rinko Kikuchi, introduced to international audiences in ""Babel"", lends strength and intensity to the brave Mako.An instant familiarity is established between the narrative and the spectator, like knowing that the Jiraiya ninja on TV will almost always defeat his opponents with a frontal or lateral sword, director Guillermo Del Toro knows what I need (because he remakes scene by scene this game of promise and delivery) and has the courtesy to respond to that desire with a festival of colors and sounds. If this game works, in good measure, it's because everything in the film encourages our suspension of disbelief. Although the plot takes place in real places in the Pacific, the world there is obviously saturated, like an R-rated rave, a cross between Evangelion and 2046 where the characters have fantasy names like those used in the chat room (Hannibal Chau? Stacker Pentecost?).""Pacific Rim"" advocates caricatured, painless destruction, at a time when documentary aesthetics strip disaster cinema of its level of escapism. Unlike blockbusters that end up hostage to the cause-and-effect relationships imposed in their ultra-detailed premises, ""Pacific Rim"" invents two or three far-fetched terms at the beginning - neural handshake! - but in the end, what matters is that there is a button in the robot's cockpit with a sword design, where it says ""sword"", and that activates an incredible sword.Exciting and fun in its sheer surrender to the playful fantasy of gigantic creatures clashing in our world, Pacific Rim still brings unexpected, almost nonsensical moments of humor (such as the one involving Newton's pendulum), although it also fails to often indulge in the obvious. - and any viewer who has already seen half a dozen works of this genre will easily anticipate the main events of the plot. To make matters worse, the fact that the initial voice-over narration ends up being discarded after fulfilling the function of facilitating the exposition ends up presenting itself as a primary and easily avoidable narrative incongruity. As if that were not enough, the project is still victimized by the need to reach a low-ranking indication, which forces it to ignore the consequences of the colossal destruction caused by the battles, which, although causing hundreds of thousands of deaths, do not leave any trace of blood. Or corpses, lessening the impact of events.With that, the film fails to forge any emotional connection with the spectator: we vibrate with the battles, we are carried away by the vitality and energy of the narrative, but we do not experience any feeling in relation to the fate of the characters, whether they were happy or tragic. Still, it's impossible for us to leave the screening room without a clear feeling of a warm return to childhood. Shallow dialogues praising the need for union, overcoming and heroism, contaminated by some voluntary humor, help to flatten the characters even more. Not even cheap sentimentality can make up for the lack of depth. In fact, it just undermines any consistent development. With all that, better relax in your chair and enjoy the action scenes - if you can.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An awful movie which bores before belief,"After seeing Pacific Rim yesterday on a whim because I thought The Lone Ranger was going to be Pirates of the Caribbean in the outback, I was sorely disappointing and felt quite ripped off for the experience.Knowing nothing of the back story, I have never been into a movie before where I checked my watch so many times to see when the pain would be over.It is really hard to believe this movie is rating so highly on IMDb, it is possibly because of the fan-boys of the movie getting in and voting; inflating the average, but I would say based on mainstream audiences, it would come in at about 2-5 / 10.The acting was terrible, the plot was non-existent, the movies run-time was too long, the scientist was very annoying, the black guy was always yelling when he spoke, the Asian did nothing to contribute, and the Aussie accents we're not real.There was no humor in this movie, lots and lots of padding with dogs, pathetic small talk love story, ego filled scenes, etc etc.. There was no rapport with the characters, and I just did not care if they died or not, it was a stale experience.I'm just glad the pain is over and I can purge this very bad movie from memory, one of the worst movies of all time.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Power Rangers vs Godzilla,"I'm not a fan of brainless movies. There are very few exceptions and I decided to give Pacific Rim a chance since it was made by an apparently desperate for work Guillermo del Toro playing well outside his comfort zone. His familiar insectoid imagery is briefly present, but for the most part this is new, and unsuitable, ground for him. I understand that he just had to get a big movie done after leaving the Hobbit and so many false starts for his adaptation of At the Mountains of Madness (a film that doesn't really need to exist as John Carpenter's The Thing is about as close as you can get to it) though Pacific Rim was the wrong script to choose.Set in the near future a portal between our universe and a universe filled with giant monsters opens up beneath the ocean and said monsters barge through and cause mass destruction. Yup, it's yet more 9/11 porn, a sub-genre that was already tiresome and overdone before this movie even came out.In order to fight the monsters the world government builds giant mechs to dish out a good old clobbering, sometimes with the help of a handy container ship just sitting nearby. The mechs are piloted mainly by twins or by close siblings who can symbiotically fight back using opposite hemispheres of the brain. As expected there is conflict between the pilots and disrespect for authority in between smash-ups.The actors are mainly cursory as without them the movie would be entirely CGI. The Japanese chick is hot, but Charlie Hunnam is neither good nor terrible, and I really don't understand the hype built around Idris Elba. The only ones I liked were Ron Perlman's black market dealer and Charlie Day as the excitable scientist.At 131 minutes the movie is overlong and there are a few small scenes that could have snipped. With a careless $190 million dollar budget Pacific Rim was lucky to not bomb as bad a predicted. This really, really is not intelligent sci-fi. It's braindead, candy-colored mayhem for angry teens with ADHD. I am so surprised that del Toro would make a movie like this, the material is beneath him.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Cocky Jocks Knock Kaiju Blocks,"Because Pacific Rim only had the insufficient clout of its pathetic PG-13 rating, all that this ""Transformers"" rip-off movie amounted to was just director Guillermo del Toro's infantile concept of a 13-year-old boy's wet-dream.I honestly swear that after the 2nd of what seemed like an endless stream of mind-numbing battle scenes, I had developed a serious case of brain-freeze. It's true.Predictable beyond belief, Pacific Rim was a mindless mess that held absolutely no surprises, whatsoever. The most damaging aspect of this film's story was that it clearly took itself way too seriously for its own good.As far as I'm concerned this film's story was just another variation on that old, stale theme of little boys who want bigger toys.Pacific Rim may have been a colossal $190 million production, but, to me, the overall return on its dollar value amounted to no more than one percent of that sum as far as its entertainment-factor stood.When it came to all of the cookie-cutter characters who prevailed in Pacific Rim, I really resented the emphasis that was placed on a bunch of cocky, self-centered jocks who were the ones intended to save the day. And the quirky repulsiveness of research scientists, Gottlieb & Newt, actually made me cringe every time these 2 despicable twits made an appearance on screen.At an overlong 2 hours and 10 minutes, Pacific Rim could've easily been edited down to 90 minutes and, believe me, in the long run, it wouldn't have made even the slightest difference to the final outcome of its truly nonsensical story.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Well done, Guillermo, well done","What can I say? This movie was, at the very least, a helluva good time. It did have it's issues; the biggest of which was some dialog that was less the amazing. The delivery and the writing prevented it from being something truly spectacular. That being said, this movie provides endless amounts of visual stimulation. The fight scenes were well choreographed and well shot. Guillermo Navarro outdid himself with this visual gem; it's easy to understand why Guillermo Del Toro has used him on most of his films. The story allows for a lot of imagination and doesn't feel the need to address all of the points of the world it created. I appreciate that in a film. The other portion of this film that I love is the ending. It lets the climax taper of naturally, a rare thing in modern cinema. Too many movies have to answer so many questions at the end that it gets drug out far too long. Not Pacific Rim, it wraps everything up in a neat package and sends us on our way. Will this movie be a historical masterpiece? Hell no, but what it will do is remind you of how to have fun at the movies.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Isn't it what we dreamed of when we were kids?,"Story?Did you call it a story?I think it is just an excuse for marvelous giant robots vs giant monsters battles.Pacific Rim isn't really telling a story,however,it's realizing our childhood dreams.When the Japanese monster movies were hot,many kids must had dreamed of giant monsters.Due to the limit of technology in the 90's,monsters were no more than plastic toys destroying model cities with dumb movements.But I remember that my childhood friends and I talked about monster movies each time we played together and the fun pretending to be monsters smashing things and got punished for that.I guess boys have inborn interests in monsters. After seeing Pacific Rim,I couldn't help crying. Isn't it what we dreamed of when we were kids?Giant monsters smashing a city to rubble,giant robots punching monsters with a fist bigger than a bus and hero saving the world again.All in one,all in almost realistic CG which gave me an illusion that monsters were alive and kicking.

"The most entertaining and fun popcorn flick this summer, the inner kid in me had a great time!","Guillermo del Toro's Pacific Rim was one of my most anticipated movies this summer. And boy did the movie deliver. I was grinning like an idiot for most of the movie. The movie is just so much damn fun and it had some of the most terrific fight sequences that I've ever seen. It also had great pacing, I wasn't bored at any point in the movie. The set up in the beginning is pretty much perfect as del Toro presents the Kaijus and how the world reacted to them. After that it's just almost non-stop action.Guillermo del Toro has really crafted a believable and expansive world that is full of detail. The visual look of the film was beautiful and full of color. You can just feel the joy and passion that del Toro had for the film through the screen. The art direction and the CGI effects in this movie are really impeccable. Guillermo Navarro also did a great job with the cinematography. The camera was always right where it should've been.The practical sets inside the robots were absolutely fantastic. If they'd done those in CGI, the movie would've definitely lost something substantial. I loved how it looked and how you got a great perspective into what it would be like to be inside of that robot. The practical sets that were used throughout the movie with the CGI really grounded the experience.The CGI Jaegers and Kaijus were done terrifically and they had a tremendous sense of weight to them. There was also enough differences between the Kaijus to keep the action interesting and the battles different. Every Jaeger also had a distinct theme to it and they were really well conceived. The sound design in this movie was also great and it really added to the intensity of the film. The great epic score by Ramin Djawadi really pumped me up during the fights.Despite the movie being a big spectacle it actually had good enough characters that I actually cared and rooted for them. I didn't like the scientists though, they were a bit too eccentric and over the top for my taste. Ron Perlman was funny though because he's just awesome as a person. I thought Charlie Hunnam made for a likable hero and Rinko Kikuchi does a great job as Mako. Idris Elba really nails his role as the tough commander with a heart. The drifting sequences were visually interesting and they were used well in conveying the backgrounds of the characters. The plot is what it is but it fits a spectacle movie like this pretty much perfectly. Approach this film with the right expectations and you'll have an enjoyable time.You have to see this in the cinema while it's still there, it really adds to the experience. It's an extremely enjoyable and fun pop corn flick, my favorite of the summer blockbusters so far.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I love giants robots fighting,"As a child of the 90s I loved TMNT, robots, ninjas, and more. Seeing a well funded and crafted film with giant robots fighting monsters is great. Had I been born 15-20 years later this film would be the greatest thing I'd have seen.As an adult I still enjoyed watching this. It did take me back, but it's difficult to enjoy it entirely without noticing it's flaws. It has a few but it doesn't stop one enjoyment. They just make you want to question the crew, e.g. why not use swords straight away. Forget the blood theories, the ease of using a sword makes complete sense when punching and pummelling a kaiju causes property destruction and increased chances of death for pilots.Aside from that and some ordinary acting in parts it's a fun film. See it if you have the chance but don't go out of your way.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not bad, after you Know what to expect","OK, so going in, I didn't know what this was aside from ""big robot fight"". After I heard the word ""kaiju"", I knew it was a Japanese manga-style tale. And it hit just about every single cliché from the ""Kaiju"" genre of anime and manga.Not that thats a bad thing, especially if you don't normally watch Japanese media.I can understand why so many if the American ""professional"" critics hated it. They don't understand the culture it comes from. Ironically, these same ideals used to dominate American media decades ago, when we weren't all emo about being a powerful nation.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"6/10 Not bad , but not great . .","I saw this on Tuesday and had little expectations. I suppose the best comparison I could make is the same expectations that I had with Battleship, except more depth (because it was directed by Del Toros).I found the characters clichéd and wafer thin. I found a lot of dialogue equally clichéd and corny. The special effects were superb, but a lot of the fight scenes were in the dark and (particularly in the sea) I found it hard to follow fights.I also found the humour a little bit thrown together (as opposed to being part of the story). In the original transformers movie, I think it had a charming humour that made it more fun then this movie.I didn't care for the characters (in fact, by far the best character only had a few mins on screen time) and the actor I really looked forward to didn't really have a character I enjoyed or cared about (and his speech about the apocalypse wasn't really that inspiring).I gave it 6/10 because despite these flaws it passed the time away and I didn't come out hating it. I just felt it could of been so much more. Its unfair to compare a directors previous movies that are completely different, but Del Toros can tell good stories, create brilliant worlds and have lovable characters. I felt this movie was really lacking in story and character.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Now THIS is how you do popcorn fun!,"Pacific Rim is a movie that knows exactly what it wants to be and delivers because everything put to screen is executed wonderfully. The performances are spot on and the actors really do make you care for the characters even with very little development or exposition. I liked the fact that the movie is its own sequel. Meaning, they cut through all the origin and set up of this world in the first 15 minutes. It's like a built in fast forward button. As it was unfolding, I kept thinking to myself that they are skipping over some pretty big and important stuff. Stuff we'd like to see and maybe should have seen. Yet, that wasn't really the case because what was left perfectly fit the story and certainly delivered the monster VS giant robot action everyone paid to see. The monsters are truly frightening and the CGI very well done. This film's budget has made news but at least it felt like they spent everything on screen.Overall, this was a very fun trip to the cinema.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A fun ""live action"" Anime.","I enjoyed this movie a great deal. It is a classic ""leave your brain at the door"" type of flick, but it is immensely fun. Being a fan of Anime, especially Anime centered around Mechas, I had a feeling that I would like this film, and I did, very much.Pluses: The special effects were phenomenal. The Mechas and monsters had real ""weight"" to them and moved naturally and fluidly. The camera-work in the action scenes was easily followable, and fluid as well, unlike the Transformers movies, which kind of give me a headache. The Story, although pretty basic and 'over the top' science, was right off the pages of a Manga, and the Japanese female character had great short hair with blue streaks and big 'ol Anime eyes. (pretty obvious that she was picked for her looks more so than her acting abilities) and all-in-all real cool. This movie also, because of the fast pace and good action (there are a few scenes that drug a little, but I'll be forgiving) makes for a lot of rewatchability, which, for me at least, A lot of movies like this, don't have.I do have a couple of negatives however; one being the acting wasn't too great, not painfully bad though, and honestly didn't detract from the fun of the film. The musical score by The RZA was pretty lame. It really didn't seem to fit with the movie, and in most scenes, kind of took the life out of the fight scenes a bit with it's funky groove. Dialogue, although had some amusing homages to many o' Sci-Fi flicks, was kind of listless and just seemed lacking, no real memorable lines from the whole film. And lastly, although they were pretty cool, I think they could have done better with the look of the Kaiju, they all just kind of looked like the 1999 ""Godzilla"" and the aliens from ""Independence Day"" had a love child, and it was a bit difficult to discern between them. 'THIS ONE IS A LEVEL FIVE!!!' ... And it looks pretty much just like all the others, so I can't really feel how bad ass it is. *shrug* That all being said, very fun, very enjoyable movie to waste a couple of hours, down right *must see* for Japanese Anime/Manga and monster flicks fans out there. A solid 7, above par, will watch again, but not anything mind blowing.Thanks for reading my review.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Pacific Rim is overall a fun/good time movie that will bring out the inner 9 year in ya. If you're going into Pacific Rim expecting an Oscar worthy performance & plot, well sorry...

Robotjox with giant Aliens thrown in,"My summary says it all. This movie is basically just like the 1989 movie ""robotjox"", but instead of the robots fighting each other, they fight giant aliens. The acting is just as cheesy and the overall feel to the movie feels just as unprofessional as Robotjox as well.The plot and the characters are a little cliché, but I have to admit, the special effects and action were very, very good. The movie wasn't a total bust. But this is coming from someone who even liked Robotjox just because it was so painfully bad, it somehow made it seem good to me, as if it was a parody of itself.

Plus Box Office fail really sad thing to say but this failed hard in the box office. Not one of the 10 best summer movies sadly. I would definitely put Iron Man 3, Man Of Steel in front of this , as I said not what I hoped for. Also my friend really hated the first 1,5 hours of the movie.

"Great, recommend watching it","Its a well rounded movie, it has great action, hints of humor at the right moments, and has a little bit of everything. Unlike most movies, I like the female main character's personality and how she is portrayed in the movie. I also like how she's Asian. They don't over sexualize Mako or the relationship between her and Raleigh, which I enjoyed a lot. I loved the relationship between the two, how deeply they connected and how their relationship developed. They don't over emphasize things in the movie, which I really liked. They give you just enough to be satisfactory and hint at the rest, they don't overwhelm you with certain aspects of the movie. This movie isn't mind blowing, life changing, or touches your heart and pulls at its strings, but overall it was enjoyable and entertaining.

Truly impressive moments and incredibly dull filler,"The visual effects and the scale of the monster/robots in this are really impressive. It looks phenomenal in 3D but the pacing is a total mess. It goes from great truly impressive moments to incredibly dull filler. And the reason why the filler is so dull? It's because of the terrible writing and acting of the characters. The characters were not one dimensional, they were zero dimensional solely consisting of shouting and bravado. You'd think someone would inject a bit of personality into this but no! The ones that try are just annoying as hell. Watch this for the effects only, I recommend watching in 3D and with heavy use of the 10 second skip forward button.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Acosmic bash,"This has a bit more personality and atmosphere than Bay's corporate burger joint next door, but in the kitchen it prepares basically the same greasy food. Taking a vague look, from afar, it repeats all the same clichés: hope is lost, regained, a rousing speech wires us for a last fight, scientists come up with a last-minute solution, then the noble sacrifice, the false death.However, if you can ignore the smell coming from the kitchen, you may appreciate a few nice things on the walls.There is a definitive style at work: colors, lights, movements. Some nice translucent environments. We also have a subjective eye in the fights, ordinary at this point but done well. Half the gamble here is to create visual comprehension: in order to visually grasp the fights we need to be placed, need something that creates human scale. It's why in the first fight there is the fishing boat, so that looking up from the deck we can acquire apparent size and distance.The other half is gravity in the eye. We have it here, some breathtaking occasions. Del Toro employed people who really understand their physics, how things ought to move and impact so that we inherit the blow. My favorite bits are during the flight to space, inside the cockpit the camera moves up as the fall begins as if our eye has actual gravity. That someone thought this the appropriate motion and not just any wobbling I think matters.So when all these things work in concert, in the best spots it achieves an operatic feel.But we still have a gravity of perception geared to simple physics. This is where the poor story reappears in another light. We do indeed need human scale in more ways than one: a human relationship as our anchor so that looking up from it we'll grasp a scale of meaning that creates emotional metaphysics, projecting a sense of world round the physical moment. (great filmmakers, like Malick, can bring more of that inner sense in the visual flow)Here they had a promising idea of this sort. In order to pilot the robots, two pilots are required in neural connection to each other, merging to one mind. They call the effect 'drifting', which is similar to terms I use to describe the same thing. The plot function is that a scientist 'drifts' with a monster brain, 'seeing' what they're planning to do which helps to save the day. Okay.Deeper, the metaphor stands for love at its purest, for shared drifting between souls as the world is torn. Bringing to the drift no memory or self, not holding onto anything, flowing in the river and you are neither the river nor separate as the Chinese muse. Beautiful and apt metaphor. Someone here obviously knows about meditation, which is exactly this drifting in the present moment, skiing on mind.Doesn't work when you also have to worry about giant toys. It's like wanting to understand quantum sense by looking at tectonic plates, different dynamics.I think the broader mistake here was that they assumed we'd need to know as much as possible about the film's world otherwise we'd be lost. So we have a bunch of stuff thrown together in the prologue and then nothing is expanded, we just segue from one fight to the next. They didn't let us 'drift' with the narrative, discovering as we go. It has no world as a result.(I think this is also why it didn't do well in the US, but did abroad. American audiences are being rewired to expect an ongoing world to inhabit for a few years, we all are but Americans are in the front of it —Nolan's Batman, the Marvel universe, Twilight, Potter and the recent crop of quality TV exemplify this in the most simple way. There may be nothing else noteworthy about this trend beyond setting up a viewing habit that I expect intelligent filmmakers to make much of. In Russia and China they are 20 years behind in cinematic terms, the sheer bulk of the thing still seems to work. Just a very rough guess.)",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
fun fun fun,"OK, so yes its a special effects extravaganza involving giant robots (called jaeger) fighting giant monster aliens (called kaiju) from another dimension. Which sounds a little worrying especially when the trailers make it look like a longer mighty morphing power rangers episode. It had so much potential to be awful. Guillermo Del Toro (science fiction/fantasy/horror storyteller extraordinaire) of course was not going to let that happen. It turns out to be very entertaining and fun.One important thing to mention to anyone not in the know is that this film is heavily indebted to the many Japanese films and TV series which tackle a similar giant robot/mecha suited subject. I think perhaps (not that I'm an expert) most notably the TV and film series Neon Genesis Evangelion. I imagine this is the sort of thing that inspired and influenced this film. Which of course is a great thing given how flipping good the first two film recaps have been. If you haven't seen any of this please go seek it out. Therefore it is a nice touch that one of the main characters in Pacific Rim is a Japanese women.Most of the action is set in Hong Kong but unfortunately, while there is a Chinese Jaeger team and also a Russian team, both have very little screen time or speaking parts. Apart from the main team in the story - Mako and Raleigh, the team with the 2nd most focus is given to the rather bland father and son (Australian? - the accents were hard to define) team. I found myself not caring too much about them to be honest. Felt more for the Chinese and Russians who had much less characterisation. Perhaps the film producers felt that they needed to have a larger white male presence in the film to reflect the films probable viewing demographic. Which I'm sorry to say is just dull, lazy and boring. I'm sure this sort of consideration is necessary for any big expensive film to be given the green light but its sort of disappointing all the same.The first few minutes of this film manage to do something quite impressive. In this very short time they manage to give a very accurate and believable summary of the first 7 years of the kaiju/human/jaegar war. 7 whole years told exceptionally skillfully in a couple of few minutes. This sets up the film beautifully.Yes i said believable! How did they manage to make it seem realistic that huge monsters could rampage around major cities a la Godzilla? Plus the fact that said monsters originate from an interdimensional portal on the bottom of the pacfic ocean? I don't know either but they did.The human interest stories are of course what make any film and the relationship between Mako and Stacker (Idris Elba's stern military leader) is quite compelling. A scene involving Mako's initial encounter with a Kaiju and then Stacker as a child is really quite poignant. The child actor plays the part so realistically (all strained breathing and crys) that you wonder if she thought it was actually happening.Of course there's a whole lot of fun stuff too. Did i mention the giant robots fighting giant alien monsters? Well, its done well, you can actually follow what's happening and the there is invention and creativity in the fights. The special effects are of course top notch. Charlie Day's scientist character is a good laugh throughout the film. The 'drifting' concept (2 humans must share the 'neural load' of piloting a Jaegar and drifting is kind of like a mind meld where they share each other's minds and therefore memories) is used to good effect.All in all this is as fun and intelligent a film can be considering its plot :) So go see!",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A colossal summer blockbuster that can rightfully be called ""epic""","After the masterpiece that was Pan's Labyrinth and the Hellboy installments, Guillermo Del Toro (who's one of the most capable filmmakers in the industry today) has launched his first mega- blockbuster that rivals the grandness and intensity of Michael Bay's Transformers franchise itself. Now, from hearing about it and viewing the trailers left and right, Pacific Rim seemed frighteningly similar to the Transformers films, and I began to doubt the quality that'd shape the movie. Thus, my expectations weren't particularly as high as they could be. On that note, I'm here judging Pacific Rim as a full-fledged action blockbuster and nothing else. I won't be comparing it to thought-provoking dramas or hilarity-ensuing comedies. No, I'll be comparing it to action flicks, especially the Transformers series and how it actually far excels the quality of those movies.First of all, Pacific Rim is epic in every sense of the word (though I've used that word far too excessively at this point). Its scale is colossal- beyond that of almost any summer blockbuster that has preceded it. The film promises intense and grandiose battles between gargantuan monsters and mechs/robots, and it absolutely delivers on that. Once you're engaged in one of these fights, you're able to witness the spectacular audio that erupts from the speakers as every hit taken booms in your ear as if the whole event is real. This is also meshed with the terrific soundtrack that complements the grandeur and ""larger-than-life"" feel of the movie.With that being said, above all the other ""pros"" of this movie, there's the breathtaking visuals that few summer blockbusters can actually compare to. Seeing the colorful streets of Hong Kong and then eyeing the water splashing as a lizard fights a gigantic mech nearby delivers such a visual spectacle that anyone would feel highly satisfied with. Of course, this experience is even more wonderful if you're watching it in IMAX 3D (the way I wisely chose to see it). At moments, it actually feels like you're underwater in the deep bowels of the ocean and whatnot. There is no doubt that the production value of Pacific Rim is incredible, and that'd just be an understatement.On top of that, there's the human aspect of the film (similar to that of the Transfomers films), which is filled with great acting, especially from Idris Elba who I must say steals the show. Everyone who's seen him on The Wire already knows what this exceptional actor is capable of. Anyways, there's a fair amount of comedy provided as well from the likes of Charlie Day and Ron Pearlman, and this time, it's actually funny. Ron Pearlman plays an arrogant tough guy by the name of Hannibal Chau, and he's just one of the other high points of the film. But then, there's the main character of the film, Travis Beckett (played by Charlie Hunnam), who's just kind of a bland individual with little personality, which is why it's easy to see how great the supporting characters are around him.As you can see, this is where I have a little bit of complaints to state about the film. Since this is another Hollywood blockbuster, you can't be too surprised when you witness the fair share of clichés that fill the movie with the generic bully fights and rescues, etc. This is what diminished the satisfaction received from the ending- it's that it ended the way you would expect it to end; yet another predictable Hollywood action flick. And as we all well know, the ending is one of the most important elements of a film, and when a film ends typically, it just doesn't leave a good taste in my mouth. Then, there's the pacing, which seems to suffer midway through the movie as you begin to notice that the film is dragging out a little, and some are probably checking the time at that point.Also, ignoring the special-effects audio, due to so many characters with accents in the film, it's often difficult to hear what those characters are even talking about, which messes up the story for me; at times, I felt confused as to what exactly is supposed to transpire. Furthermore, as an action movie and nothing more, Pacific Rim, without a doubt, delivers, but its not-too-memorable ending and abundant Hollywood clichés doesn't make it as decent as it could've been. Nonetheless, I highly advise anyone interested in action flicks (especially since the past year's blockbusters like Iron Man 3 and Man of Steel have been mediocre) to see the film in IMAX 3D, and only then will you appreciate it and understand what a proper action movie should truly be like.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
ohhhhh yeah!,"Before going to see Pacific Rim I had read quite a few mixed reviews. I really was sort of ambivalent about going to see it, even though I am quite fond of big action and monsters.We opted to see it in IMAX 3D, which got a thumbs down from me (3D films should be filmed in 3D to really pull it off. Conversions are just weird in my opinion) but others in my group thought it really enhanced the action so use your own discretion.After sitting through the movie, I have to ask... ""WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE??"" I can't for the life of me figure out how folks could have issues with the movie. I thought it was a brilliant homage to the Godzilla movies of yore with a healthy dash of the fun of Anime robots but beautifully filmed and well acted by everyone involved. This is precisely what a summer popcorn movie is supposed to be. Just all kinds of exciting.The action might be too much for the under 10 kiddos.

"Third rate screenplay, first rate production","When I first saw the trailer for ""Pacific Rim,"" I said to myself ""Rock'em, Sock'em Robots"". I mean, the idiot-level concept that the gigantic monsters would not be stopped by torpedoes, missiles or guns at sea or a submarine net rigged with explosives or electricity just seemed to stupid to endure. However, two things made me change my mind: 1) my wife wanted to see it and 2) the movie had a really beautiful ""look"" (thanks to topnotch production values and use of a RED camera (the same camera used for ""Step-up Revolution). Minutes into the movie, my other suspicions were confirmed: 1) this movie is marketed to an international cast, as the the three main characters are all of different races and nationalities; and 2) the storyline would be one cliché after another.Nonetheless, I rate ""Pacific Rim"" highly for the acting, direction, music and those aforementioned production values. Even the cliché plot lines seem fresh and original due to the fine acting; especially Idris Elba, who could impress reading a soup can. Also, always welcome, is Ron Perlman, who somehow always manages to class up the most ridiculous projects.With a cast of real actors, not stars, the most modest of romances and lots of violent action, this movie screams ""International (particularly Asian) project"". I certainly expected to see more Asian names among the technical credits. However, when one figures three-fourths of this movies grosses came from outside the US, it is clear Guillermo del Toro intended to make an international film, and he certainly made a handsome one.

A fun action movie that brings back fond childhood memories of monster movies of yore.,"I saw ""Pacific Rim"" with a friend of mine last night. He's a big fan of Del Torro and we're both monster-movie fans. So for us, watching this movie was a no-brainer. I'm no expert on CGI but at least to my untrained eye the special effects looked great. It was fun watching the mechanicals of the robots and the various weapons of the robots and the monsters. The fight scenes were exciting and the set designs were realistic. Movie-dom has come a long since the late fifties where men wearing Godzilla suits destroyed paper-mache' cities.Yes, the acting is far from first-rate and the dialogue is clichéd. But I didn't watch this movie to see Lawrence Olivier quality acting or Shakespearean dialogue, that would almost be out of place for an action movie like this. It would be like going to Ruby Tuesdays for a meal served on one-thousand dollar a plate china.As a side note, I'm surprised this movie isn't a bigger money-maker. At a 180 mil.+ budget they have to sell a lot of tickets. Maybe the rental and foreign markets can take up the slack. A movie like this should be a bonanza for marketing with toys, video games, t-shirts, lunch boxes, etc. I don't have TV but if the makers didn't have a tie-in to a fast-food restaurant chain with small action figures included with ""Happy-Meals"" then they missed a good opportunity to lure the kids and their parents to the local multi-plex. So I would be surprised if this movie doesn't turn a profit, at least eventually. Speaking of kids, this sixty-year old was a ten year old again bringing back fond memories of monster movies I watched back in the fifties and sixties.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
If you know what to expect it delivers,If you want to see an entertaining story and top notch acting you will be terribly disappointed. The story is as basic as it gets with tons of clichés and the acting is just plain horrible.BUT if you want to see huge amazing robots fighting huge amazing monsters this movie is just perfect. Colourful and clean imagery and entertaining badass fights. There are plenty of jaw dropping visual effects and I really liked how easy was to identify the robots and monsters (nulike in transformers).The whole thing just sucked me in and I never had the feeling I was watching a two hours long movie. The movie knows what it wants to be and is a refreshing addition to the robot/mecha genre.,7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Terrible Movie. Nothing but CGI.,"Just saw this movie in 3D - was expecting so much given the hype and the fact that Guillermo Del Toro was directing, but it was a total let down. Everyone I watched this movie with thought the same.This movie was a complete borefest and consisted of nothing but CGI?? Seriously - there was nothing else. The acting was wooden and mediocre and every moment was full of cheese. The script was non existent. Where was the story?? The whole movie was as if the entire CGI department was just vomiting everything they possibly could on screen. It is CGI overload. Don't get me wrong - The CGI is good - no problems there, however, there is literally no film or story here to watch. You didn't care about any of the characters and everything was totally predictable from start to finish. Everything was repetitive. As if all the above wasn't bad enough, the soundtrack for the film was abysmal - the tune was repetitive, amateur and majorly annoying. It was like a kid messing with his keyboard playing the same few keys - seriously, whoever did the music in this film should be out of a job.This film is for a seriously dumb audience without any intelligence - I'm amazed at how much money and CGI was thrown at this movie given the total lack of story and script. This is without doubt Guillermo's worst movie in history. He has messed up big time with this movie. He seems to have forgot the absolute basics in movie making. Have a story to tell at the very least. There is no story, no script, no decent acting or anything. The movie is full of brainless stereotyping too - it's embarrassing and like a child made this movie. There is nothing to keep you interested. CGI does not make a movie good - when will Hollywood learn this?? You will not see a better example of this fact than watching this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Godzillas vs Transformers,"I'm usually the one defending the blockbusters, I even liked Green Lantern (kind of) but man this film is a pile of crap. I was going into this having watched The Man of Steel and was thinking with lots of money you can make a good film out of anything these days. Well, I was wrong. Almost every scene with no kaiju in it is painfully bad. No characters, no dialogs, no ideas. Everything is so corny it's just pure irritation to watch. The characters are so unrelatable I could not care less for what was going on. A suicide to save the world? Whatever... And that part with a sword in space just blew my mind. They are fighting kaijus for 7 years now and haven't figured out by now how to use a sword which just slashes the poor beast in two? Oh go to hell. So overall unless you bet you life that you'll watch every blockbuster ever made, stay away from this.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Power Rangers,"Power Rangers.....This movie is something that you would have thought the super powers of the 90s Power Rangers would have evolved into. I do like the fact that the this being one of the hits for summer blockbuster that instead of the aliens coming from in the middle of the space they come from the pacific rim (hence the title) because this gives an alternate and more pressing need for the world to unite against a common enemy than other movies. I think this element gives the movie some credibility into how the world would actually revolve when something this disastrous would happen. All in all, if you liked power rangers back in the day, then you will like this movie!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What Did You Expect?,"I notice a lot of people pointing out the many flaws of this movie, of which there are, indeed many. But honestly, what did you expect going into the theatre? I sat down next to people who were discussing Gundam, Godzilla, anime etc. I myself had very few requirements of this movie for it to be good. I wanted to see giant robots fight giant monsters in a very large city. You know what I got? I got giant robots fighting giant monsters in a very large city. Surprise, surpriseIn the meantime I enjoyed seeing an homage to the classic genre of, what, giant things fighting each other, which I wanted. I grew up watching black and white VHS tapes of Godzilla vs fill in the blank so maybe I enjoyed it a little more than the average person and it had been quite some time since I'd seen something like that. Cloverfield was a unique take on it but it lacked the epicness of two titans facing off. This is quite possibly the most epic of the giant monster genre since it has them in abundance.What it boils down to is just that, expectation. I did NOT expect the acting to be quality and it wasn't. I did NOT expect the storyline to be interesting and maybe I had a little too low of expectation for that because it reached a point where even that became a little interesting as the movie drew me further and further in. My single regret is that I didn't see it on a bigger screen and didn't see it in 3D. I would pay to see it again just for that experience. I've always had an appreciation for epicness and it doesn't get much more epic than trying to protect the last of the human race from immeasurably large monsters with equally immeasurably large robots and all the contextual issues that come along with it.I give this a 9/10 because this movie is exactly what it was meant to be and nothing more. I would have given it a 10/10 only if the acting was better and the story was legitimately good but my opinion of what a good story is is pretty high.Thank you Guileermo Del Toro for giving me a nostalgic experience on the big screen.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Get ready for an action filled weekend.,"A movie of this nature would be regarded as a ""cheesy, plot less flick"" filled with just clumsy action scenes that really have no basis. However, after I got out of the cinema I could not get over how pumped I felt.In all honesty this movie makes for an action packed summer blockbuster that deserves appraisal and excels in an intricate plot line as well as pure fist-pumping thrill when it comes to Monsters vs. Machines. After all the majority of us miss out on movies that are on such a high scale proportion such as Godzilla and Jurassic Park and it seems that directors and producers shun these movies due to the fear that they may not achieve success. Big props to Guillermo del Toro for making the movie come to life as well as solid performances from the lead cast such as Idris Elba as well as Charlie Hunnam which really puts together a solid blockbuster that is worthwhile to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Did we all watch the same movie.....,"... or do I just have standards? Someone in the comment section said ""Is this the most stupid movie ever or what ...highly advanced alien civilization trying to invade earth using giant creatures that are cloned??? or give birth??? and much more stupid humans using giant robots to wrestle them""... and then he goes on to give some options and ask why it was done this way. I'll tell you why, original poster, because it is one way to get alien invaders, giant cloned creatures, and giant robots all into the same movie. This - and all big budget action pictures made today - are not about American audiences. They are about overseas audiences, where 75% of the money is made. Specifically, China and Russia. Thus you have minimal dialogue, big explosions, buxom scantily clad females, and muscular macho men who look like they came straight out of a porn movie with break-away clothing.How minimal is the dialogue? Well my husband watched this with one earphone on so he could hear the film, and one off so he could listen to me parodying the dialogue MST3K style by what I thought was going on just by the muted overacting. He stopped the film and took off the other headphone after awhile and said - ""to not be hearing anything that's being said you are remarkably spot on"". And this is exactly what the filmmakers are going for - something that you do not need to be an English speaker to follow.I did watch it later with dialogue or else I would not be able to write this review in good faith. I'm giving this a three just based on the work done on the sets. After all, production values wise, this is not an Ed Wood production. I shall now prepare to be pelted by eggs and tomatoes, most of them, I assume, coming from Russia and China.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fun visual spectacle with heart,"Pacific Rim is a fun visual spectacle with lots of heart and soul poured into it. Best movie of 2013. Guilermo Del Toro wrote a poem to our childhood awe at monsters and heroes. I'm sorry for anyone who didn't get it.Plot: It's the story of a world being threatened by powerful external forces and the human resilience rising to fight against it. Instead of the brain dead grim pessimism of the dark, gritty movies of today we finally get a story where we can see some hope humanity can rise above its own pettiness and become better.Characters: Its easy for characters to be engulfed and forgotten when larger than life events occur but in Pacific Rim their personalities rise against the tide and do not let themselves disappear. Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) and Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi/Mana Ashida) are great and powerful characters. Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day) steals the show, he's just amazing. Even the piloted robots have personality here.Effects: Just perfect. The Robots and monsters are completely convincing and visceral. They are beautiful and creative. The Robots' control room are very creative as is the concept of drifting.Overall this a work of love that deserves to be appreciated by anyone that still have a beating heart and a creative mind. It'll awe you.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Massive Clunker,"This film is unoriginal inside and out. This film is a whirlpool that has sucked so many ideas from its obvious precursors (Godzilla, Transformers) and related works (Hellboy, Matrix, Aliens, Starship Trooper, Iron Man, Inception, District 9, the list is endless) that one expects it to be drowned in writs.This film has a script that is as poor as you'd come to expect. It isn't horrendous, but it often arrests the cast.The plot problems are few but marked. Some would not escape a child.So why can I still remember the film after the popcorn is finished?There is enough humour to cover the dialogue shortcomings, enough detail to keep you appreciative and seen in IMAX the carnage is sumptuous. The cinematic and visual symbolism from Del Torro is a cut above the usual fare.There are a few political ideas that creep to the surface. The film effectively excludes Europe from the plot - a definite message about the future. One solution to the problem of monster terrorism is to build a large wall and tell people they will be safe behind it.But what makes this movie more than the sum of its parts is the focus on the robots. This film is a clean homage to so many of the ideas that came before it, but they are fully supported by the characters who are purely there to do battle with monsters in large robots. Very little screen time is given over to any concept that isn't related to FIGHTING MONSTERS IN VERY LARGE ROBOTS.And ultimately this enlarges the film, because the action sequences are the heart and sole, not sections of a script written just for the video game. There is no message to discern beyond FIGHTING MONSTERS IN VERY LARGE ROBOTS is a thing.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the most enjoyable film experiences in a while.,"I went into this film expecting a big, stupid monster vs mecha movie. I had no desire to see it as the trailers had failed to impress me. The very first scene however, took my breathe away. It had been so long since a film totally immersed me in its world. I felt a chill down my spine as the jeager and kaijus first took screen. The CGI is outstanding and undoubtedly deserves the Oscar for it.The action? My God, the action. Transformers, take notes. If you want to make a tense, exciting battle scene, actually show what's going on and make the enemy actually dangerous. These Kaiju meant business so every skirmish was a heart pounding experience for me. The fact that the CGI was so convincing only enhanced this.Let me get this out of the way. I do not think this film is as stupid or badly acted as many other people do. In fact, I quite liked the leads, especially Mako. I felt this film did a good job developing their characters and building their friendship. The story is of course not spectacular. I'm not saying the acting is stellar either, but it's by no means bad. But this movie has heart. It has heart in its characters, it has heart in its theme about teamwork, and it has heart in its battles. There are few films I can give such praise to.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

From then on the movie begins and I still don't know whether to think it is a good movie or notThe intro really hyped me up even while the trailer made it look like the movie was going to suck. I was really overwhelmed by the whole experience, the music, the special effects and the acting. The story started to progress and I liked it, just non-stop action, science fiction and epic robots fighting huge insane monsters.

From the first 5 minutes of the movie you can understand and comprehend the world the movie presents and inmediatly caughts your attention and never lets you go. The story is very simple but the actors, especially the supporting cast, are giving everything they got to the point I can actually remembera lot of them after months without watching the movie. The fight scenes are the highlights of the film, it has only a few, like 3 I think, but these fights are some of the best out there, making you feel excited at all time.

The answer is very simple: You make the movie for you, and not for the audience.

I am sure his preoccupation with Manga (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga) fueled this masturbatory CGI exercise.

"The tribute is there, but in the end Pacific Rim cannot stand out","I was very surprised to see that a movie with a concept like Pacific Rim where humans build giant robots to fight giant creatures that emerge from the ocean had such a positive reception, critics included. Seeing that it was directed by the brilliant Guillermo Del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth) this really could be a rare quality entertaining movie. Del Toro wanted to make a tribute to classic monster movies like the original Godzilla and the feel is all there, even with his neo-psychedelic signature we all subtly enjoy. But essentially the question is if these movies were even good to begin with. Unfortunately, the result is just average. The plot and its presentation are not original at all, feeling that we are watching an average 90's movie. The characters are stereotypes, etc, etc, so there really isn't much to see here. And Rinko Kikuchi is probably the worst and most annoying actress ever. What's good in here is that, although this is a traditional commercial movie, the fight scenes are really awesome and very fun to watch, plus the special effects are incredible. It's a pity we have such a long and sometimes boring build up before all the action. You will have a good time, but Pacific Rim is what it is: a standard summer blockbuster with some glimpses of quality that really can't stand out.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Modern Giant robots vs Godzillas?,"I can't believe this actually got financed and made. It's like a geek boy's dream and it has no big name actors. You basically have giant monster-beasts coming out through a dimensional breach in the Pacific Ocean (hence the title), trying to destroy a world that fights back by uniting and creating giant robots (or mecha) piloted by humans. The war seems to be mostly won because of these until new, more dangerous monsters start coming out years later at a faster frequency. At that time, only a few giant robots remain in fighting shape, the rest being destroyed or decommissioned, with less than a dozen pilots remaining. The end is near unless something drastic happens.So, most people will want to watch this because of the spectacular giant robots versus giant monsters fights, and it certainly delivers, but with some caveats. The monsters look great, even real, and not corny at all as in most Godzilla-type movies (no rubber suit here). However, near the end, they become harder to differentiate and I didn't always know who was who. They changed the red blood to some blue glow-in-the-dark blood. The monsters being alien, it makes sense and avoids making things too bloody. The monsters lack personality and are just portrayed as destructive beasts, but I won't hold that against the creators. The robots look cool and have an imposing physical presence despite the near-constant avoidance of showing them next to humans for scale. They didn't look that much computer-generated to me although I knew they were. The robots and monsters looked their size (massive) because of their ponderous, slower than real-life movements, as well as the sound effects that were excellent. The fights themselves were enjoyable and didn't overstay their welcome. I didn't suffer from action fatigue as when fights last too long without real stakes. However, because of close-ups, fast editing and lots of rain, it wasn't always clear what was going on, so the action could have been better. I did love it though.Story-wise, the creators do provide an explanation that makes some sense for this monster invasion. I would even quality the story as interesting although a bit predictable although the accents were sometimes difficult to understand. It's a shame most of the secondary characters were not really developed because they looked interesting. One of my most memorable moments involved a ""flashback"" involving a little girl running away from a giant monster (she acted so well). Acting was acceptable with the highlight being Idris Elba as the Marshall. Most emotional dramatic moments unfortunately did not really connect with me except for the stuff involving the Marshall and the Japanese woman. The b-story involving 2 eccentric scientists wasn't really great, nor was it particularly funny although it tried to. It was good for a change of pace though.For some realistic, amazing-looking ""live-action"" giant robot versus giant monsters that don't look fake, this is great stuff. It doesn't look cartoony, it's not corny and you don't need to be a total geek to enjoy it. Don't watch if you're allergic to the subject matter though. I'm a geek and I probably liked the movie more because it reminded me of some great mecha anime (such as Neon Genesis Evangelion) without really looking like it.Rating: 7.5 out of 10 (very good)",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great action. Characters... not so much,"Not a fan of blockbuster movies, I was dragged to see this by some friends. In the first part of the movie I was pleasantly surprised. The scenes were visually beautiful and the plot was interesting. It will still require lot of suspension of disbelief because the basic premise, that the most efficient method of killing giant animals is constructing giant robots to punch them, is ridiculous. If you can accept this, the movie will be very enjoyable......at least until the Hong Kong base part. We'll meet a lot of characters there who are best described as caricatures. They are single-dimensional and their interactions are forced and annoying. I hold two hysterical scientists and all the Jaeger pilots in this group. The altercations between the main character and another pilot, and between the main character and the general are grating. They can only appeal to 10-year olds in the audience and their idea of how Real Tough Men act like.Fortunately the female lead makes up for this by being an original and interesting character (unlike her male counterpart), and a knife-wielding Ron Perlman would be beneficial to any movie. They will help the transition to the final fight.In conclusion, not a masterpiece but a decent monster-robot blockbuster.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Good old-fashioned, explosive fun","I was giving up on the idea of ever looking forward to another big Hollywood summer movie ever again, but then Pacific Rim comes along with its charmingly simple plot, incredible special effects, an almost perfect tone, 3D that didn't destroy my eyes or make everything look dark and blurry, and, most importantly of all, a sense of fun. I felt happy and alive coming out of the theatre, and for once I felt as though not a cent had been wasted on my ridiculously expensive movie ticket. This is one you should all go and check out. Need more reasons to do so? Okay, here we go...Guillermo Del Toro. This guy knows how to make a movie. Pan's Labyrinth is an absolutely amazing film, and one of my all time favourites. Hellboy 1 was decent in my opinion, but the sequel I thought was really good. Pacific Rim I like a little more than the Hellboy films, but it's definitely not quite up there with Pan's Labyrinth. It lacks the emotion and the artistry of that film, but it's still a great movie, just in a different way. This movie is visually astonishing in almost every regard, and I think Del Toro himself can largely be thanked for that. The action scenes feature CGI so good you won't even feel like complaining about it, and are constructed in a coherent, satisfying manner. There's no irritating shaky-cam here, and thankfully the movie doesn't skimp on the violence either- no humans die graphic deaths of course, but a number of giant monsters get absolutely pummelled and ripped to shreds by the robots, and it's satisfying as hell to see this happen.Keeps the plot simple. There's no overly convoluted villain motivations, no absurd and annoying twists in the story, and no characters that are too complicated for their own good. This movie features giant monsters that want to take over Earth, and this causes the humans to build giant, controllable robots to fight the monsters. That's your plot. There are characters, and while they're almost all archetypal, the movie's aware of this, and somehow this makes it okay. We get enough character development to at least care for these people. This movie uses very traditional, standard characters in a way that's somehow not bothersome. The actors are all serviceable too, with Idris Elba probably coming the closest to standing out. So the dialogue, characters, and acting are all, for the most part, merely serviceable, but they really don't need to be anything more in this movie. The characters remain consistent, and aren't irritating (not even the comic relief scientist characters), and for me that was all they needed to be in a film like this.Crazy scale: The monsters and robots in this movie are absolutely gigantic, and this makes the fight scenes awe-inspiring. These are creatures that are literally the size of sky-scrapers, and there's something crazily entertaining about seeing such huge things do battle together. There's a real weight to the fight scenes as well- the booming sound and convincing CGI really makes you feel every single punch. It's all very forceful, intense, visceral, and convincing. And yeah, as mentioned before, the sheer scale of the movie never stops being impressive. You know these things are big when one robot wields a cargo ship and uses it as a melee weapon.The movie is actually fun: Not all movies have to be fun and entertaining. Hell, a lot of my favourite movies aren't particularly fun to watch (Requiem for a Dream anyone?), yet they might be really engaging at both an emotional and intellectual level, or they may provoke strong physical reactions do to the way they're constructed.. Big Hollywood blockbusters, however, should be fun. They shouldn't all try to be so ""deep"" and ""thought-provoking."" Big action scenes and personal character drama just don't really mix too well- maybe Christopher Nolan can pull it off, but he's the exception in this case. Leave the deep stuff to the independent and foreign film-makers. Big movies like Pacific Rim should just be a blast to watch, and, thankfully, Pacific Rim is an absolute blast to watch. It never stops being entertaining- I was giggling in glee throughout almost the entire film, and I left the theatre feeling almost euphoric. Yeah, I had a great time. And even better, the movie feels like it was made by people who were having fun as well. It's nice to watch a movie and get the sense that the people who worked on it enjoyed doing so. Maybe in reality they didn't, but it certainly doesn't feel like that based solely on just watching the movie they ended up making.So should you see this one? Yes. Definitely yes. Especially if you've come out of more than one big blockbuster film this year feeling like you haven't really enjoyed yourself. Pacific Rim is explosive, silly, and completely over-the-top, but the film-makers were aware of this, and as a result just had fun with the whole thing; you find yourself laughing with the film rather than at the film. It's a gleeful, somewhat tongue-in-cheek film that just wants to entertain its audience.According to the ever reliable Wikipedia, Del Toro envisioned Pacific Rim as an earnest, colourful adventure story, with an ""incredibly airy and light feel"", in contrast to the ""super-brooding, super-dark, cynical summer movie"". If this was indeed the case, he couldn't have succeeded more.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Now that is probably fine for many movie goers and if that's what you like, fine! I like substance, a well scripted movie that gets you completely involved. That is not this film. Another issue is why do these type of films have to be so long?

"Big, Loud and Lots of Fun.","Pacific Rim is one of those movies that doesn't come along often. A big, loud, monster movie. PR borrows heavily from the Godzilla movies. Monsters and giant robots duke it out. The plot is simple enough to work: An underwater 'tunnel' has created a link from the bottom of the ocean to another dimension, that dimension is full of monsters who want to conquer earth because why not? the monsters have apparently done this before throughout the Galaxy so to them it's like riding a bike. The world however, decides to fight back, so they build these giant iron man robots (i mean seriously, they look just like Iron Man)anyway, so these giant robots now have to kill these monsters and destroy the tunnel. In between these events you have some impressive battle scenes. Some battle/fights scene take place off the coast of China, Three-mile island, another one takes place in downtown Tokyo (which is so amazing, i rewound that part of the film to watch again) in the middle of the film is a 20-30 min fight sequence that is just action cgi porn.

"Great fun, action packed, one for the guys,ladies and gentleman PACIFIC RIM","After seeing pacific rim I have to say the visual effects were stunning, Idris Elba was awesome as he portrayed the steel plated commander 'Staker Pentecost' and was as strong and temperamental as he is in 'Luther'. The acting overall was up to scratch from the whole cast in particular Charlie Day as 'Dr. Newton Geiszler certainly offered the audience some comic relief from all the action. The Plot was of course was ridiculous but the visual effects and action throughout more than compensates. overall a fun action-packed movie for enjoyable watching.7.5",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Chix Chat on Film review: A true monster movie,"What I really want to do is write about Idris Elba (Stacker Pentacost) and how his walk is poetry in motion, and that I could stare at him for the 131 minutes running time of this film with his commanding presence while gracing us with confidence and style, but that would be unfair, since I should discuss Pacific Rim. This film reminded me of the old Godzilla monster movies akin to the likes of Godzilla versus Megalon. Those films always had the populous running for their lives while Tokyo was perpetually being destroyed, but the update to the tale is that the origin of the monster attacks does not come from nuclear fallout. This film was not as campy as the early Godzilla films, but there was a healthy level of cheesiness, although played very straight with Charlie Day (Dr. Newton Geiszler) as the only comic relief, which is somewhat odd since he plays a scientist. He actually looks the part, but if he ever wants to be taken seriously in a role he has to change his voice inflections and tone, which is very comedic. If all the English and Australian actors can do it I'm sure he can. This film was primarily driven by the special effects, since going in there was little doubt as to how the story would end. The last film that I saw that had a truly surprising end was Cabin in the Woods, I digress. The special effects were most noteworthy because the scale of the jaegers and the kaijus was strikingly convincing. With their movements, when the fights broke out and when buildings were destroyed, I simply marveled at the fact that these creations looked remarkably real. I'm not sure why the notion that a tall wall will keep anything out but it was yet again tested in this film, but again the scale was amazing. The kaiju unfortunately were never shown much clearer in the film than what was seen in the trailer, when they appeared it was either dark, raining, shown as a television broadcast or they were underwater all of which were distorting factors. We did get a nice variety though, with similarities to a turtle, gorilla, and a pterodactyl. This was a testosterone filled ride, there were only two females with any dialogue in the entire film and one of them was quite masculine. It seemed that the target audience was tween and teenaged young men who would get a kick out of the fight scenes, there was a miniscule love story but not enough to make this film a female fan favorite. It was entertaining so I give it an amber light.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Ludicrious but Completely  Awesome.,"Okay if you are a mark like me for a movie about Giant Robots battling Monsters from another Dimension, then you will love this movie. The number one thing you have to know is that this is a B movie. Its meant to be goofy, implausible, fun. Besides all that, though is that it tries to deliver those qualities in the best possible way. It fully owns up to what it is and delivers those qualities 100%. Cool looking monsters and Robots, definitely. Bad ass action scenes, check. A somewhat hokey plot that still sounds cool, double check. Basically you either buy into the concept and enjoy a well made movie or go watch something else.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Better then I expected but not WOW Great.,"PACIFIC RIM - From the first time I heard about this film many months ago. I thought nothing of it. Only recently with the word of mouth hype did I decide to go and see it. Special Effects were out of this world. The slow moving giants were perfect for 3D. The sound...amazing. The story...was a little better then alright. I didn't think there would be much of a story. Because without a story. Special Effects just become eye candy.I couldn't help but think of Independence Day meets Godzilla with a little bit of Starship Troopers. Except less actors...a lot less actors. Dated...but I enjoyed ID4 a lot more.No one even clapped at the end on opening night. The director still has it. But not like he use to. I enjoyed this as much as I enjoyed Hellboy 2. Just alright...better then most movies. Maybe I expected more because of the Hype. So I won't add to it.But just say what I feel in my opinion. The young kids will probably like it more. Say 6-7 and up. But not the BLOCKBUSTER movie I was looking forward to. My fun of the Summer is still with Star Trek Into The Darkness for many, many reasons.Want to see what I thought was a masterpiece of Guillermo del Toro's work. Treat yourself to the Spanish (Subtitles in English) film 'THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE...that should have gotten him an Oscar instead of PAN'S LABYRINTH.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Amazingly Fun Movie with Great Effects and Action Scenes,"Pacific Rim has everything I expect from a quality, smart action movie.The effects are perfect and the design of the Jaegers and Kaiju are creative and on par with previous Del Toro's visual feasts like Pan's Labyrinth.The characters are very likable with special mentions to the great performances of Idris Elba, Rinko Kikuchi and Charlie Hunnam.Rinko Kikuchi in particular is very talented as she makes her character adorable and bad-ass at the same time. Ron Perlman is perfect as Hannibal Chau.The fight scenes and accompanying music are adrenaline ridden and breathtaking. The scale of the battles between giants among a crumbling city is epic as it should be.And speaking of the soundtrack, it has one of the best music I've heard in recent years.A instant classic and a movie experience all movie lovers deserve to watch.Side note: I would throw all my money to watch a Pacific Rim x Godzilla Crossover.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Don't go see Pacific Rim in 3D,"My Son and I just went and saw PR in 3D and it was so hard to follow in 3D that we took the glasses off. I would recommend if you go see it, go see it in 2D. Not a bad movie but aside from the beginning which was short and the ending their was not much action in the middle of the movie. It began to drag on and the Character development was lacking and the plot was laughable. The beginning of the movie was where all the meat was contained as far as having a rich story, but Del Toro choose instead to skip over the most important part of the money as if it was just a side note. My Son became bored and dosed off in the middle of the movie as it became hard to follow. Hard to believe they would drop 185K and not have more to the movie. The best scenes were in the previews.

Rim delivers the goods,"It has been a long time since I saw a movie in a theater that actually exceeded my expectations, but Pacific Rim really did.Everything fits in this movie: the storytelling, character build - up and - oh man - the special effects. It's not easy to make a fight between a robot and a gigantic monster seem real and thrilling, but Guillermo does it. I was on the edge of my seat, heart throbbing during some of the battles.It's not just blunt action, hopping from one scene to another without a decent story behind it to back it up. This is something we see too often lately, but Pacific Rim makes a beautiful exception.Keep up the good work Guillermo, I hope this one gets a follow - up as it deserves. Can't wait to see that one.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"better watch it in 3D, not disappointing but it still has so many wasted potential","after watching Pacific Rim premiere in theatreactually the premise of the movie is pretty much the cliché one...a world apocalypse. what was made it different from another American film is the concept of ""giant robot"" with similar synchronization control with a certain famous japan robot animation and the Japanese concept of big monster vs big robot.the graphic, the robot , the action is in the top tier. i can't argue that this film is the orgasm drug for robot and machine hardcore fans and geek, it delivers the mean of showing you enjoyable action with giant robot who punch and got punched with big monster named ""Kaiju"".although it has a awesome CG action, and actually a good storyline....., but it's a shame that this film still has some wasted potential in it. the setting of the world, some characterization (especially at another pilot), tension building, useless character and, the prolonged flashback, and some wasted scene, are still in it and with a shame...this film get a ""C"" Point for the first, second and third factor.anyway it's the film which better watched with 3D for the impact, because the story didn't really have any twist and surprise in it...... and the tension in top of that.give it a score 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Big Robots Vs. Bigger Creatures= Winner: No Spoilers!!,"Short and Sweet This isn't Romeo & Juliet, War & Peace or any Epic piece of fiction like those. It is a big budget smack-down. The battles in the cities around the world are pretty cool, but i would have enjoyed a more international flavors to it. But that's just my opinion. Transformers/Godzilla mash up, with shadows of Japanese robot fighting stories. The Jeagers (Robots) themselves have plenty to look at on the big screen, in some shots you get a good, if quick look at the mechanics inside, Sort of like the brilliant work done on the First live action Transformers movie.Characters are light and not completely original but what is nowadays? Good special effects and plenty of action.... a few nice non action character scenes to remind you of the stakes. Music is alright but not rousing. I give it 8/10",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Neural connection did not work!,"This film is about the special forces of human controlled robot fighters who fight against giant sea creatures.At first I liked ""Pacific Rim"", but as the film progressed I found it boring, then I found it unbearably bad. First, the film is dark all the time, with grayish tint throughout. I got so tired of the monochromatic stimulation. More colour could easily be provided, such as changing the colour of the wall in the base camp. Second, the plot is just not engaging or exciting. There were several occasions when I thought the film was ending, but it continued. And dragged on. The film just did not know when to stop. The plot does not build up to an effective climax either. That motivational speech by Idris Elba ended up being laughable.Another thing that really killed my enjoyment was the bunker scene in Hong Kong. Despite the film being set in the 2020's, people in the bunker wore clothes in the 1920s. And they even spoke in Mandarin, which is not spoken in Hong Kong. The director sacrificed such important factual errors for cinematic clichés. And while I am on clichés, the first scene with Chinese people in the Hong Kong base shows the people from China playing basketball. My eyes rolled so much when I saw that scene! I wish I did not waste time on this film. The neural connection certainly did not work for me.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
CGI Porn,"This is a movie of extremes. When it is good it is great, and when it is bad it is abysmal, yet the balance is still positive.So, what were the hits and misses? Let's start with the bad:1) Actors: Granted, the dialogs are as camp as they come and this is not exactly a psychological thriller, yet none of them went above the ""completely forgettable"" level. Except for Rob Perlman, of course and even him seemed to struggle.2) Plot: this is CGI porn, and as in porn, the plot is merely an excuse to tie up some great CGI scenes. I love mindless action movies, and I usually do not have much trouble suspending my disbelief, but this time I found myself making too many efforts to dismiss some blatant plot holes.3) Pacing: for a movie with no plot, even as great looking as this one, 131 minutes is just too much. With characters lacking any depth, and speeches a la Independence Day, one ends up feeling that it would have been a great 90-100 minutes movie. Not looking forward to the extended cut.Now, the good:1) CGI: CGI is nowadays ubiquitous so when I read some review saying ""amazing digital effects!"" I take that with a pinch of salt. To be honest, not even the new Star Wars trilogy impressed me much. But this one is great. Not a matter of budget, but of taste.2) Great References: Godzilla? Mazinger Z? Anime? Sci Fi B movies of the 50s? Everything is there, but it's done with class, not a mere copy paste of random bits, but organically fused in a single piece. Many of the objections are more limitations of those genres than issues with this movie only. A wonderful homage to our childhood.3) Love: Guillermo del Toro loved what he was doing and it shows. It is not the perfect film, but is still enjoyable, despite it's bad spots.Hey, it's about having some mindless fun and that he achieves!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Falls just short of greatness,"With its neon cityscapes and giant robot battles, 'Pacific Rim' really does evoke the mecha genre of anime while also calling to mind every Godzilla movie you've ever seen to the tenth power. It's filled to bursting with great ideas, concepts and images, but a rather weak cast (besides Idris Elba, who owns in everything he's in) and poorly fleshed out characters didn't allow it to resonate like I hoped it would.Characters died, I shrugged. Cities were leveled, I shrugged. It's a dazzling film, but I never once laughed or teared up. It never made the hair on the back of my neck stand up or quicken my pulse. In short; I wasn't moved. For much of its 130 minute running time it felt like watching someone else playing a video game (though certainly playing it well). There's simply too much here that's good not to recommend, but for me the whole was less than the sum of its parts.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Gundam Movie Review,"""Pacific Rim"" is a spectacle for the eyes and ears. I mean this movie is a visual treat from well detailed robot and monster designs to high over the top, but well choreographed action sequences and massive collateral damage. The world that Guillermo del Toro creates is imaginative and his character designs are mesmerizing and complex. The sound design and the sheer force of the films score captivates you into a ride of sight and sound that pleases all your senses. From the metal grinding noise of the robots to the fleshy and almost beast like cry the monsters make, this film has you feeling like you are right there in the middle of the action.While the movie is mostly is a visual treat, it doesn't forget about its characters and there humanity. The film isn't all bells and whistles, it really does have some really nice character moments in its script, which are about overcoming fear, moving on and trust. These moments make us care for the events that are unfolding. However, the script isn't all serious business, it knows when to have fun. Some of these moments can be a bit too campy though and some of the emotional moments feel forced. The film sometimes even becomes contrived, mainly towards the end. However, director Guillermo del Toro balances things pretty well.The actors in this film do a pretty good job, but the only real standout is Idris Elba as Stacker Pentecost.This character is sort of the leader of the resistance and Elba commands attention every second on screen. Charlie Hunnam is pretty good as Raleigh Becket, a Jaeger pilot, who left the resistance after a traumatic incident. I wish they showed more of his inner battle, it would have invested us into the story more. Rinko Kikuchi as Mako Mori is really hit or miss. The scenes where she is more reserved are good, but when she tries to emote, it can be awkward at times. The rest of the cast is pretty solid and the supporting cast is pretty good, especially Charlie Day, who brings some of the lighter moments to the film.Overall ""Pacific Rim"" as a giant robot versus giant monster movie is pretty awesome. The visuals, sound, and well directed action are all top-notch. They provide a treat for the eyes like never before. Even the 3D is spectacular, the best I've seen since ""Avatar,"" it really absorbs you into del Toro's imaginative world. The story, mainly the human element, is a bit weaker as it can feel contrived at times. It keeps us involved, but never takes us to the next level of emotional satisfaction. I give it 4/5, a blockbuster with some of the coolest and most imaginative action that I have seen this year.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Absolutely blown away.,"I'm writing this because I lost a bet with a friend of mine. I said that if I like this film I'd write my first ever IMDb review. What can I say? I lost.Going in skeptical that this was going to be a CGI monstrosity with little plot, lots of explosions, and bad acting, I was beyond surprised when I found myself lost in the film. Charlie Hunnam's performance wasn't top notch acting but he pulled off his character well without overacting. The responses by other characters in the film seemed genuine and almost realistic. Idris Elba was perfectly chosen for his role. The Jaeger battles were shot, from what I perceived, as if someone were nearby watching the battle unfold. Another point I liked was the love story between Hunnam's character and Rinko Kikuchi's character, Mako. Well, I should say ""implied love story"". Only in one line of dialogue was it even referenced. Their relationship was merely implied to the audience and then left to simmer as to not take away from the rest of the story.The rest of the supporting cast did well, but I thought their roles were rather short. The Russian and Chinese pilots had very little screen time but once again it seemed the film was made to be more realistic with more real-world emotional responses. In that respect it was well done.Overall, I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would. 3D is the only way to see this film. I'm not a big fan of 3D but this is one film that really uses it well.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It's good but it not great,"I remember when this movie was first announced, as an anime/manga/kaiju/Del Toro fan I was hyped and excited. As the movie started to near release my excitement grew, seeing the robots and hints at the chaos in the Kaiju's wake were enough to make me feel like a little kid again watching my Godzilla movies. Even reviews were stellar for the movie and I thought it was to good to be true......and it was This movie is a good ride but it is NOT the great and awesome movie everyone is making it out to be. I understand supporting a film because it has a new fresh idea for Hollywood but that does not give a movie a free pass because this movie could have been allot better. Now if you liked the movie thats fine but I really wanted to love this movie and I only found my self just liking it.Sure the plot is as thin as nails but thats to be expected and I am not holding that against this movie. Many Kaiju films have horrible plots and the reason you watch those movies is to see giant monsters destroying cities. Now this movie has great visual effects and it looks amazing. The 3-D is the best I've seen since Avatar but the action scenes were missing something, in fact the whole movie seemed to be almost reaching the peak of amazement but never reached it, so for the whole movie I felt unfulfilled and the movie felt like it was missing something crucial.Now I did enjoy the movie it started out strong with an amazing opening sequence but as the movie reached the middle point it started to bog down. The action sequences didn't excite me or pump me up like when I saw Man of Steel or the Avengers. I wanted to leave the theatre wanting to run right back in to see it again. I found myself not really caring if I did see it again This has been a very strange summer, each big blockbuster has divided audiences and fans alike. Go see the movie for your self and see if you like it because allot of people were blown away. I just think the movie could have used allot more something in it because it was just a bland film in my eyes.I didn't hate Pacific Rim I did enjoy myself I just expected so much more I'll see it again when it comes out on bluray and I'll probably buy it when the price drops.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
i guess i'm a snob,"i apologize for some ""less than perfect"" word choices here but IMDb won't let me use certain applicable words to this genre!based on the attitudes i saw expressed by viewers and fans, i decided to attempt to lower my standards like most of you attested to doing beforehand. i've heard of this technique before and always thought it was akin to letting a bully spit on you every day instead of just taking a swing.i was able to overlook the acting, and the story, and the writing, and the casting, and everything else that makes a movie. because, hey, this is at best a pointless action movie full of eye candy and ""super tough"" ""giant robots"" doing the coolest stuff since robot ""jocks,"" right?but, to my dismay, i still failed. apparently, impressive cg of crazy stuff happening has absolutely no effect on me anymore. it's been happening a bunch and now i'm sure of it. it happened in iron man 3, into darkness, avengers, dark knight rises, hobbit - the list goes on in varying degrees back to the birth of cg. effects can not replace human content. that's it. i hate to say it, but the only time this rule isn't true, is when buffoons are watching the movie, and that makes up most of the USA so, as my title says, i guess i'm a snob.the appearance of my plight is akin to sexual impotence, insofar as my chemicals won't get pumping with presented with something physical meant for enjoyment. but it's not something i would want to treat like normal impotence, because this situation is tantamount to being expected to get it up and make love to a dead body or an unconscious woman. my brain overrides my body and thats it.so strip away the cg glory and they eye candy and what do you have left? well you got kick butt ""giant robot"" fighting going on, right? again, i wanted to enjoy this, as i too am an old ""battle tech and ""row bow"" tech and everything in between"" fan from around the way. i'm 31 and a lot of my existence is predicated on the jacking off to ""giant robots."" i'm a prime candidate for this movie.well the movie did not deliver on these lines either. the fighting basically stunk. i think with all their little tributes to japan, this movie could have wised-up and made their ""giant robots"" agile, y'know, while they were in there being completely unrealistic anyway. these things moved like glittery walking trash cans with Parkinson's. it's just not fun to look at or believable in the face of these beasts, who also moved way slower than their bodies implied. they had animal muscular structures and should have been a lot more fast and deadly.to make a good pure action movie, you actually need to still be quite an effective story teller. the story is told through the bodies being photographed. its a dance. this movie brought none of that idea to the table. there was an insufferable level of information-poor action going on. i spent much of the time utterly confused about what exactly was taking place on screen. i always thought this kind of presentation lent itself to movies trying to cover up poor choreography but that excuse doesn't hold when its all cg and you can do anything you want. when i could decipher the action, it always amounted to a clunky punch or ineffective ram and tumble of some kind. a sword was randomly brought out toward the end, and promised an improvement on the action if only by virtue of ""how can a sword not help this mess"" but it was sadly forsaken by the writers before and after that brief moment.the only other possible leg this movie had to stand on pure, unbridled, and blinding nostalgia. the very nature of allowing nostalgia to become criteria for enjoyment of a medium allows one to paint a quite distorted picture indeed. personally, i have an aversion to this practice because i have been disgusted with how it makes people act. if you got something out of this film using nostalgia, then i commend you, because i thought this movie failed at conjuring the best of anything i had ever loved in the past.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
HK Auteur Review - Pacific Rim,"As a war between humankind and monstrous sea creatures wages on, a former pilot and a trainee are paired up to drive a seemingly obsolete special weapon in a desperate effort to save the world from the apocalypse.The fights are the main attraction. You either go along with that premise or not, there's no two ways about it. In reality, it's probably more resourceful to bomb these giant monsters or shoot them with a very big cannon, instead of making giant robots to punch them to death. But where's the fun in that? Suffice to say, the fights are a tense visceral experience and the scale of everything delivers an epic sense of awe. They do everything to up the ante and surprise the audience. Special moves are only used in climatic moments and there's just something about a giant robot using a boat as a bat that's just hilarious and jaw-dropping. These fights run very dangerously to the cinematic equivalent of watching somebody play a video game. That's why I like the drifting mind meld concept, because it solves that problem by it properly adding both physical and emotional conflict to the pilots controlling the Jaegers as well. It focuses to how well these pilots are controlling the Jaegers as opposed to how the Jaegers are fighting the Kaijus.The fights are shot somewhat tightly but for a very good reason. Shooting the fights close holds the tension and injects the sense of jeopardy and stake into every exchange in the fight choreography. I imagine if the fights were covered entirely in long wide shots, it would lose that sense of scale and the fights would look silly. That said, I had no problem following what's going on because emotionally it felt right to be watching them that way. And personally, it was doubly fun that the film was set in Hong Kong.There's been a common complaint that the characters lacked development, I disagree. Basically these people all have baggage and they have to band together as a team or fall apart. The film spends time building arcs for its ensemble cast, and it's sufficient to justify the epic robot monster fights. That's it, so I don't understand that complaint. Adding neat little quirks or oddball idiosyncrasies to these characters would have been overkill.The dialogue is one of the film's weaker portions. However, depending on how well each actor was able to milk the lines, I was still able to have fun with it. I couldn't stop cackling at Charlie Day's fast-paced high-pitched deliveries, who rises above being ""Dr. Exposition"" and balances the film with comic relief. Day's exchange with the rival math-based scientist played by Burn Gorman is essentially a cartoon-level quarrel equivalent to Daffy Duck arguing with Bugs Bunny. The math Gorman's scientist applies is is grade-school at best. Ron Perlman facetiously entertains in flying colors as the Kaiju body parts black marketer Hannibal Chau, the most asshole character name ever created. Idris Elba also adds significant weight as the team leader. So for me, the side characters take the cake from the Charlie Hunnam and Rinko Kikuchi storyline, which was played very straight for story purposes.Guillermo del Toro is aware of current big-budget blockbuster tropes and differentiates himself from those trends in Pacific Rim. There are no homage or geek references to distract or alienate the audience. Rinko Kikuchi's Mako character is not sexualized or filmed through a salivating male gaze; she is a real human character with a story and treated as such. The film doesn't play like a military recruitment advertisement nor has any blatant nationalistic or jingoistic intentions. Perhaps one of my favorite things about Pacific Rim is it tonally divorces itself from post-9/11 sentimentality. The world has its own distinct fictional reality, where destruction is not linked by evoking imagery, memories or emotions from September 11th. Civilians evacuate from buildings, hide in shelters and the streets are clear for the Jaegers to bash the Kaijus. Most importantly, del Toro never dwells heavily on despair or hopelessness and the audience can enjoy the city-wide destruction guilt-free. All those things counted together, Pacific Rim is truly a breath of fresh air amidst current blockbuster aesthetics and a film made with the most earnest intentions.Without an A-list star, a love story or a recognizable established franchise (i.e. Godzilla or Transformers) , it's not hard to see why Pacific Rim didn't score at the box office. As Snakes On A Plane proved at its theatrical release, the geek fan base doesn't represent much of the core population. The geeks merely are just the most vocal. Perhaps other parts of the demographic are alienated just by the material itself, despite that del Toro is aiming to entertain everybody. If there's one underdog movie people should give a chance to this summer, let it be Pacific Rim. It's a passionate earnest film made by a director that loves the material and wants to deliver good clean fun with a positive message for everybody. His attention to every little detail exudes his excitement for the material; that passion rubbed off on me and elevated my enjoyment. It's the most fun I've had watching a movie this summer.

"A new experience for the sci-fi movie lover, or a bunch of action and nothing to surprising?","My girlfriend and I watched this movie at the cinemas. We paid a few extra bucks to watch it in 3D. That didn't change the fact that this movie was average. Idris Elba didn't fit quite well in his role, and the storyline is outdated and boring. A couple of sea monsters rising from the ocean now and then for no apparent reason. Then getting their buts kicked by two men in a giant robot. Great plot right? But don't get me wrong though, as n sci- fi, its average,but as something new that you've never seen before, then its fantastic. This isn't a movie for every alien movie lover, but it should suit most of you guys. If this movie was to be compared to let's say Battle L.A.and Battleship, pacific Rim will not fit those standards.

Do You Remember...,"Do you remember what it was like to experience wonder, as a child, at the flickering images on the screen. You didn't know that's what they were back then, or that the odd plot contrivance was just that and could mean the world (internet trolling didn't exist yet...). It was imperfect, but honest, immersive fun.This is the virtue of the nostalgic underdog film. A film that smells an untapped niche and goes on a joyful rampage through it. I think it's fair to say the original Indiana Jones did just that, revive childhood memories to create a roller-coaster devoid of cynicism. Gremlins did it. More recently, District 9 did it too.The Summer of 2013 gave us many examples of modern cinema at its worst: the cynical exploitation of childhood memories, evident in one sub-par reboot/remake after another. Action cinema as a whole has been aching from an emphasis on noise and scale rather than emotion and choreography (not just of action, but design and movement, both within and before the camera). It helps to have the new film of an earnest, geeky master to look forward to.Enter Guillermo Del Toro. Enter Pacific Rim. And here, hidden under a confused marketing campaign, is what we've been waiting for. A film that balances respectful nostalgia with irreverence (something Transformers and Man of Steel did all wrong in their respective extremes), a film that makes you remember what it was like to be a kid again. Rather than washed-out, fast-cut chaos, we get a neon-colored ballet of destruction through locations and between creatures and robots that scream the love of their creators in every frame.It's a silly film brilliantly made, and just when you wonder whether it isn't throwing certain tropes of its genre at you too literally - whether it be certain sub-stellar performances, mainly from leading man Charlie Hunman, a often predictable plot, etc. - it surprises you with a moment of sheer beauty.It makes you remember what it was like to be amazed, and it makes you hope. That the Kaiju genre is back for good. That people continue shoveling money at Guillermo Del Toro. That his Hellboy III and Mountains of Madness get made. That we see more of the great Idris Elba and Rinko Kikuchi, not to mention Mana Ashida (showcased here in a phenomenal flashback scene).A solid 9, no question about it.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Largely conventional, all action and little substance","I just saw this film in IMAX 3D and was glad to have done so. That is not to say that the film is amazing, because it is in fact riddled with flaws. The dialogue is wooden at best, and cheesy on more than one occasion. The relationships between the main characters were not developed well, and apart from the jaegar/kaiju fight scenes and the adventures of the mad scientist in Hong Kong, there wasn't much else that made the film stand out.However, the fight scenes were great, and it's worthy of being a summer blockbuster when compared to some of the other disasters that I've seen recently in theatres. The IMAX 3D experience complimented this aspect of the film.Overall, it deserves an 8/10 for the cinematography alone, but drops to a 7/10 because of the less-than-impressive dialogue and acting.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Best film of the year so far,"This is the best blockbuster movie of the year so far. Watched in 2d so cant comment on 3d version. Excellent story, simple and not too overcomplicated, with obvious major nods to manga/anime influence. Basically its all about monsters vs giant robots fighting and you get plenty of that! No slow build up, straight into the action. Characters typical clichéd bunch with tragic back stories, but reasonably well done so matches the story. And a few eccentric characters very typical of Del Toro. Very much like typical Michael Bay OTT film but Del Toro influence raises it above this. Only niggles is that some of the action shown very close up and dark so maybe not getting the best out of the fights, but that is the style of the film. And as with many blockbusters, the sound effects sometimes seem to swamp the dialogue. Also film feels bit rushed could actually do with another 20 mins. But all that is very minor. After a good year for sf films with iron Man 3, Star Trek and Man of Steel, and Elysium still to come, this is even better. See it in the cinema, this is the place to watch it! Simply perfect entertainment.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Bad acting but stunning visuals,"Bad, bad, I mean, BAD acting. There are times when the Asian chick Mako has some screen time, and honestly, it's very, very cringe worthy. Idris Alba does his best to be a good actor too, but the situation that he's placed in makes him especially impossible to make his acting shine competently (esp. the elevator scene. I'll say nothing more.). With that being sad, what really saves this film are the visuals. I mean wawaweewa. The movements of the jaegers. The way they move are so realistic that you feel their enormity, their crushing gravity within you as you watch this film. It's as if you're actually there, which is what makes this film so awesome (visually)! And then there's this one scene where... I won't say anything more because I won't give it away, but trust me. When you see the film, you'll never forget it. The image will stick with you to the grave. I'll just give you one clue: sunlight. Boom. That's it. Anyhow, there are times, however, when the film makes you feel that cheap props and super fake-as-hell stuff are being used. Maybe Hollywood was cutting corners OR Guillermo needs to find himself other artists who decorate his scenes, fabricate the non-cgi equipments, and so forth. Those annoying knick knacks really killed the film. But other than that, the visuals. For those alone, the film is worth 7 stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Wouldn't it just be more cost effective to fire tactical nuclear weapons at these creatures instead of building, well, 'buildings' to fight against them?

The amount of detail in the movements and in the scenery is a sight to see. I mean honestly, there isn't a clear use of military guns and tanks that we've all seen before; its all replaced with giant robot fighting that is pretty much new to us.The story?

But...I didn't really need much of a story because I was so glued to the screen.The idea of the whole movie is where I must applaud. Parts of this movie are so well thought out and original its not seen very often. The idea of using 2 pilots to command a robot, now that I think isn't that original...But the idea of neurology, the design of the whole movie, using weaponry different than some grenades and just some bullets....and the way everything looks in the end.I can say that this is going to be a movie I will be eagerly looking for online and on HBO, as this is literally the best giant robot, giant monster, military, fighting movie EVER MADE",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Release your inner child (and enjoy),"Okay, being a fully grown man, perhaps I should have grown out of enjoying watching big, over the top monsters smashing big, over the top robots to bits by now. Sadly, I haven't (which also probably explains why I'm single).If you're looking at Pacific Rim (a film where big, over the top monsters come out from a portal at the bottom of the ocean and start laying waste to our cities, therefore meaning Earth creates an army of big, over the top robots to stop them) on an action-only basis, then it's a sure fire winner. Yes, I loved the action - it was truly amazing special effects wise and I was instantly a twelve-year-old boy again.Sadly, I'm also a thirty-six year old adult, which means that my logical brain does demand some sort of cohesive plot to tie a two-hour film together. This is where Pacific Rim fell down. It seemed to take every action cliché from the last two decades and put them in here. A fair part of the story is told in a 'Lord of the Rings-style' monologue at the very beginning of the film, eliminating the need for any complex plots - it just tells us what's been going down. Then we have the need to recruit the burned-out ex robot pilot who's quit the service, but is the only hope we have now (a cliché so old it was lampooned in Hot Shots Part Deux), plus, when our hero does step up to the challenge, he's met with suspicion and downright hostility from the other pilots (think Team America of all films!). Then throw in the obligatory 'love interest' and dialogue that seems as if it's been completely lifted from Independence Day and you have a weird mish-mash of action films.However, all this may be cliché, but you still have the epic battles to fall back on. I forgave all this and just let my inner child enjoy itself. The only real downside were the (yes, clichéd) scientists. Seriously... they're 'uber-geeky' to such an extreme they wouldn't look out of place in a cartoon. In my opinion, if you're looking for a silly, over the top, all action film then you'll enjoy what's on offer here (I just fast-forwarded the scientists in the end - they could well be related to Jar Jar Binks - they're that bad!).http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not Your Average Robot Movie,"Pacific Rim was easily one of my most anticipated movies of the year. With a great director like Guillermo Del Toro, a fun cast with Idris Elba and Charlie Day, and monsters vs kaiju; hyped was an understatement. The movie almost lived up to its hype but unfortunately had its flaws.The movie is all about the human's war with the Kaiju (monsters from the ocean). To combat these monsters, society creates monsters of their own. The movie doesn't try and be anything more than that, a vehicle for monster vs monster combat.As expected, Del Toro delivers when it comes to one of the most stunning fight scenes I have ever seen. You could have put the middle fight scene from Pacific Rim into the middle of Batman and Robin and I'm still giving it a good score. I also enjoyed the performances by Idris Elba and Ron Perlman.Unfortunately, there were a few negatives. Firstly, the acting was just OK. Aside from Elba and Perlman, there weren't really any great performances. The scientists definitely overacted and the rest were just pedestrian. This wasn't a huge issue as I didn't come for the human interaction, I came for mecha carnage.The most disappointing thing with the movie was the ending. It's not that the final fight scene wasn't great in itself; it's just that it couldn't live up to the fight scene in the middle of the movie in the streets of Tokyo. The ending was a bit anti-climactic.If you are a fan of great action you can't go wrong with this movie. If you're a fan of mecha anime you can't go wrong with this movie. If you're a fan of Del Toro's you can't go wrong with this movie. Do yourself a favor and see it on the big screen, you won't regret it.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pacific Rim harks back to classic robots versus monsters blockbusters.,"Boom! This is what we all wanted. Colossal mechs punching the blue blood out of enormous beasts. Del Toro presented the sprawling action how he knows best, visual splendour and cinematic showmanship. Now, this is no means perfect in fact I would only say it's good, but I would be lying if I said I don't enjoy it. In the near future, Earth is rapidly becoming ravaged by Kaijus who are spawning from a mysterious teleporter in the depths of the Pacific Ocean. Humans retaliate by building and piloting gargantuan mechanised weapons known as Jaegers. And so we watch the enthralling action gripped to our seats as we shout ""Yeahhhh, punch it, slice it, rip its head off!!"". Del Toro has always been a visual director, and Pacific Rim is another great addition to his filmography. The neon lighting backdrop of Hong Kong where the ensuing battle rages on in the consistent downpour within the city's bay. The glowing venomous blue eyes of the Kaijus as they catastrophically cause chaos through animalistic means. Numerous characters sacrificing themselves and destructively being ripped apart as they attempt to save their world. The stakes are high, and so is the production value. Full marks for visuals, direction and sound editing. Charlie Hunnam may have the physicality as he boisterously waltzes around the Shatterdome as if he owns it, but his acting is as monotonous as a broken metronome. Rinko Kikuchi is just a total babe, and certainly underrated in everything she's in. Idris Elba gives the best speech since 'Independence Day' as he motivates his pilots in ""cancelling the apocalypse"". Everyone else? Functional. Charlie Day plays one of two irritating scientists and consistently annoys the heck out of me with his high pitch squealing. The story is fairly basic with limited surprises, but I'm sure you expected this. The first half is unquestionably slower than the second. However, you wanted titanic combat sequences, and you certainly got them! Monstrous popcorn entertainment, just lacks that extra punch.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Much better than anticipated,"We all saw the trailers early on and perceived this to be an adults version of power rangers. Whether that sounded good or not to you, it's still worth watching. Don't be put off by the lack of big name actors in this movie as this proves that the reputation of an actor does not men they will make the film good, also proved by The Lone Ranger.Pacific Rim's premise is that giant dinosaur like creatures called Kaijus are attacking the countries which surround the Pacific Rim, which contains a portal which leads to the Kaijus dimension. To combat this, the UN pooled their resources together to create giant robots known as Jaegers to fight them. The Kaijus begin to evolve and with the UN losing faith in the Jaegers, they make one last stitch attempt to permanently deal with the Kaijus.Starting as always with the positive points, everyone in the film provides an A plus performance. Maybe it's because we expect the acting to be mediocre due to the emphasis on CGI and the lack of big name actors. Maybe this would make us look at this and think it's much better than I thought it would be. But no it's just plain good. The CGI is marvellous, as are the fight scenes and both combined is just as colossally gorgeous as the monsters. Whilst the story isn't as engaging or stimulating we would expect, especially from Mr del Toro, the ending is still satisfying and leaves room for a possible sequel. As an added point i'd like to ask how the hell did Grown Ups 2 beat this movie at the box office? because basically that film is bloody awful.Overall, it's like this concept was purposely drawn up for Michael Bay just so that he can have a CGI vacation with this. However, the story is still engrossing ad the action and acting keeps the viewer in the moment and excited. If you're action fans, you will love it and if you are fans of a deep, twist filled storyline you will learn to appreciate it. Basically, if you are reading this, Go see this movie.

Godzilla updated,"This movie had lots of promise and has some fantastic well done elements. The look of the movie is great as has been noted by just about everyone. However at the same time it feels derivative. Like a great master craftsman making the same artifact over and over, each one better than the last but ultimately all being the same thing. We've seen this movie before, just not as polished.Idris Elba and Ron Perlman steal the show, their characters define the extremes of the human world better than any of the others and they chew scenery with the best of them. Elba especially managed to perfectly embody the anime archetype of the pained father figure general without making it ridiculous, I don't really know how he managed to do it even though I watched it happen. Perlman was just fun in every scene but his scenes worked best when his insecurity was on display rather than the Hellboy persona he channeled for other parts.The two scientist dweeb types while fun and entertaining still feel shoehorned in for stereotype. The main leads are frankly forgettable cookie cutter jock types that seem better suited to TV sitcoms or police procedural. The ""wacky"" secondary characters such as the other crew or mission ops guy we never really see enough of to care about.Plot? Well, not much of that going on here. Pretty standard alien invasion/giant monster fare with the we've-seen-it-a-million-times lone wolf character coming back for redemption. This is basically a good Godzilla movie wrapped in a live action Anime design.Still, as popcorn munching fun it was pretty good. If it were any other director/writer I'd give it a higher rating purely for glitzy cartoon style entertainment but I expected a little something deeper and cerebral, if only in passing, since Guillermo Del Toro was the creative driver. The theme of merging neural pathways of 2 or more people to drive a giant robot has rich possibilities but the movie never mines this idea beyond the surface.If they managed to make a sequel I'd go watch it but I'd temper my expectations.One good thing after watching this movie, I'm not as bummed as I was before that Del Toro doesn't get to make Lovecraft's Mountains of Madness.In the credits James Cameron is thanked (among others) and I think that can clue you into what this movie is, grand spectacle extremely well crafted but very linear predictable story.The movie is dedicated to Ray Harryhausen and Ishirō Honda which is another clue what this film is, a love letter to giant monster movies, and frankly that works for me.Recommended with some flaws.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A hundred million dollars buys a lot of computer generated imagery, but that seems to be all it bought. The dialogue is just plain dire, a string of clichés, including the required ""noooooo!"".

Monsters + Robots = Cool,"I was convinced to go watch this movie in the theatres when my partner said: ""There's this blockbuster about giant robots fighting giant monsters."" When someone tells you that and you're honest with yourself, you've got to see it, right.When I'd watched it, I thought it was a fun movie. I didn't get bored. It had a classic story with lots of the classic ingredients: traumatized main character, wicked scientists, etc. I really enjoyed it but it didn't really touch me and it didn't really 'stick' with me afterwards. But that's kind of what I was expecting. I don't see any deep and meaningful themes in it and I won't say it's artistic just because it's Guillermo del Toro's. I don't really think he had that intention anyway. I think he just wanted to make something cool this time. No more, no less. If his fans want to turn this movie into something like a far-fetched political statement disguised as an action movie, that's fine. But I won't. (Remember: he made Hellboy to.o) This was no more than a fun movie, temporary enjoyment. I would probably watch it again on TV but I wouldn't stay home for it, record it or buy it on blue-ray or something. I wouldn't call it awful and I wouldn't call it a masterpiece. I just thought it was a lot of fun.Never mind that lots of things in the movie were not really credible. And I don't mean 'realistic' by that. I'm a huge fantasy and sci-fi fan.

"""It's 2,500 tons of awesome!""","Pacific Rim is a sweet blend of several superb ingredients: the ambition and mass-destruction of kaiju films (such as Godzilla or Gamera), the premise and high-tech concepts of mecha anime (like Neon Genesis Evangelion), and the familiar style and imagination of Guillermo Del Toro (Hellboy I and II, Pan's Labyrinth, and more). It's especially noteworthy since there has never really been any major blockbuster films that portray giant robots and giant monsters on screen together; we've always had one or the other, but it's pretty common fare for mecha anime to slam them together and make them fight. A film like this seems long overdue.As expected, the action in Pacific Rim is very big and incredible. There are three major battles that pit towering machines against rampaging sea monsters from another world. Entire cities crumble within the film's prologue; in the fights that ensue, buildings get crushed, cars and trucks are thrown all over the place, and it truly seems like the world could get trampled at any moment. In between the battles, the film breathes pretty evenly, with the same playful energy that made the Hellboy movies so fun. Humor doesn't really play into it that much, but with the acting and colorful production design, this film is never all that serious or brooding; it's rather cheesy, lighthearted, over-the-top, and cartoonish. And it's fun that way.It's not all about the big fights and silliness though; the film has a solid focus on storytelling. It does take some effort though. The film introduces a plethora of clever concepts behind the premise of giant robots and monsters: terms like ""drifting"" and ""neural handshake"" become integral to the plot, and if you're not digging the concept, you might get lost (having already been familiar with even deeper concepts in the Evangelion saga, I couldn't help but to draw comparisons; in spite of that, I found Pacific Rim easy to follow). Aside from that, the plot is well-structured, and it's especially refreshing to see that every battle presents new problems and situations that make things unpredictable and more intense. Characters are given diligent attention; they are colorful, but they also show some decent depth and emotion.This film utilizes decent photography and editing. Acting has been criticized for being really silly, but it matches up really well with the film's overall tone and style; it even goes so far as to reinforcing the film as a live-action anime. This production uses some very big-scale and highly imaginative sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is really cool too.Pacific Rim, finally, an epic movie that shows giant machines and giant beasts brawling and wreaking havoc. It's got the elements of classic kaiju monster films, robot anime, and maybe even a little hint of HP Lovecraft in the mix. It is exceptional for its worldbuilding, and I found it very immersive and impressive. However, if you're not captivated by this world, then you might just shrug it off as something silly. If you're taken by this film's concepts, then it comes heartily recommended.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Some of the best big, dumb fun you are likely to see","The creative maestro behind such films as 'The Devil's Backbone' and the masterpiece 'Pan's Labrynth', it is fair to say Guilermo del Toro is no stranger to dark, deep stories with heart and soul, so it is a surprise to see 'Pacific Rim' actually comes off rather light and fun.To my surprise, the story of a future on Earth where mankind does regular battle with aliens, who attack from deep beneath the ocean via a bridge between their dimension and ours, lacks in development; the movie also falters with some awkward moments where the staging seems in need of a polish or a re-write. Performances are, for the most part pretty good, with a highlight being del Toro regular and fan favourite Ron Pearlman, his introduction clearly indicating how aware they are of how popular a casting choice he is. To the negative, most notable are, strangely, the male leads, who seem, at best going through motions, or at worst unbelievable.All that said, however, del Toro knows precisely the film he is making here and awards courting performances did not weigh too heavily on his mind, unlike the fantastic score, which actually should go up for an Oscar next year, being one of the best elements of the movie. It should also go without saying that it is visually spectacular, grand in scope and precise in detail. Despite its lightness in tone and the fact that it is ultimately little more than a huge summer blockbuster, del Toro directs with an assured hand, the likes of which Michael Bay can only dream he had.This is big, dumb fun, but really good, well designed big, dumb fun.

I still had fun and even was emotionally involved at some points. I don't really understand how some people expect some Oscar worthy plot or something like that. Yes, people are free to criticize. For me as a movie lover it matters if I had fun or not and let me tell you: the action and CGI delivers the fun I wanted from this movie. Acting wasn't that bad at all and I actually liked it. Don't have super high hopes and you will not get disappointed. It is that simple.The CGI in this movie is top notch and the movie is worth the time. Don't let the negative reviews get to you and see it for yourself. ;)",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Action is the name of the game for this enormous film.,"Giant robots versus giant alien sea monsters. What more could a geek ask for? Pacific Rim looked exciting right from the first trailer, aiming to unleash the action nerd in all of us. While there are some fumbles along the way, Pacific Rim succeeds in bringing larger-than-life action to the big screen.One of the first things you notice about Pacific Rim is the outstanding CGI. The visuals are at a top tier quality, some of the best I've ever seen in film. The fictional Kaiju race of aliens are brought to life along with their formidable foes, the human built Jaegers, through eye- popping CGI that really helps set the tone for what this movie is all about: gigantic action. Pacific Rim does not falter in delivering some of the biggest action scenes in recent time. The battles between the Jaegers and Kaiju just keep getting bigger, badder, and more epic as the movie goes on. The sheer scale of these monster battles is large enough to put even a movie like Transformers to shame. Mastermind Guillermo del Torro is in the directors chair for this film, and his vision to create a large-scale, CGI glorified action film is executed very well. The action sequences are gargantuan, and are highly entertaining to say the least.Where Pacific Rim thrives most is on the battlefield, focusing all of its attention on the clashes between the Jaegers and Kaiju. Where the movie falters is during the non-action scenes where it tries to tell an engaging story with characters you care about. Don't get me wrong, there is plenty of action in this film, but too often does the movie stray away from the epic battles and tries to tell a smaller story inside this massive conflict, and it at times slows the movie down, nearly to a screeching halt. The plot is pretty straightforward, and while it has its short comings and clichés, it's good enough to be entertaining and at the same time not complete non-sense. Again, this is an action heavy movie, and when Pacific Rim gets too far away from that, it starts to show some of its weaknesses.The cast does an OK job, with the better performances coming from Idris Elba and Charlie Hunnam as Stacker Pentecost and Raleigh Becket respectively. Charlie Day, one of my personal favorite actors, and best known for his work on It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia, provides comedic relief but doesn't quite fit the bill for this movie and his character seemed almost annoying at times. Rinko Kikuchi plays Mako Mori, and her performance was far and away the worst of any of the cast members, showing almost no emotion in her acting. Overall the cast was mediocre only adding a more human element to the sort of monster vs. monster theme.It won't keep you emotionally attached, it won't get you deep into its story, and it won't make you care for the small stories outside of the action. But what Pacific Rim will do, is provide exhilarating action sequences supplemented by stunning CGI and keep you largely entertained by the super-sized battles that only get bigger and better as the movie progresses.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Bad*ss action movie,"I really enjoyed this movie, it's pretty much all you could ask for from a movie like this. Cool action scenes, great robots and special effects and excellent monsters. When you're watching a movie like this... You don't really expect a deep story with really complex characters, right? This movie is just great at what it's trying to do, I watched it years ago in cinema on release but it was pretty memorable. One of the stupid things about this movie is that the robots have this bad*ss chain sword that can literally cut a monster in half with one slice but they could have used it more often, right? It makes the huge guns on the robots look like peashooters compared to it and it has perfect close-quarters capability against a similar monster. Otherwise it's a great movie and I would recommend it to anyone who likes great high budget action movies, it reminds me of the Michael Bay Transformers movie but better. Which I like, yeah, I really enjoyed the first three movies, fight me. 7/10!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not only a technological marvel, but a great movie","Pacific Rim is one of my favorite movies. It has a great value of rewatch ability, and the special effects and music are some of the best of all time. Uprising wasn't the worst movie, but it didn't do the series justice. What Del Toro established was loosely based off of a lot of Japanese's comics and cartoons, but executed in an ultra realistic way. Everything from the water the Jaegers waded through to the epic fight scenes. Ramin Djwadi did an absolutely fantastic job with the ost. You may recognize him from iron man and game of thrones. The actors also did a great job. The lead actor was the weakest in my opinion. All of the supporting actors did a spectacular, though. (Charlie Day, Ron Perlman) I give this movie a 10 out of 10 mainly to balance things out. I believe it should be at least a 7.5 or 8.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pacific Rim - Noodles Review,"The story is actually really simple, in which huge monsters rise up from an inter-dimensional portal in the Pacific Ocean. The movie drops you in the middle of it, in which it's been happening for awhile so we've created huge badass robots to fight the monsters. It's a decent enough premise to make the awesome concepts of battles between giant monsters & giant robots plausible. It's reason enough for us to get locked into this movie. The character development was alright, as was the acting. Charlie Hunnam plays the protagonist; and while I absolutely love him in Sons of Anarchy, he's not spectacular in the movie. He gets the job done and you root for him but you're gonna buy his action figure. Then there's Idris Elba. We already know he's awesome, because with every role he takes on, the film could be terrible but you know Elba is gonna perform greatly. However, not everyone comes to this movie for the characters. We came to watch giant robots battle giant monsters. And I'll tell you it's so awesome. The battles are so epic. The scale of these battles are humongous and it allows you to actually see the entire fight occur, as opposed to the Transformers movies where it's all in you face and you can't tell what's going most of the time other than the sound of clanking metal. No, with this movie you see it all, and it is absolutely awesome.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Worst movie i've ever seen ...,"I actually went out of my way to create an account here so i could voice my displeasure regarding this trash. I can't believe this movie has received a 7.2 rating. If this is the type of movie our society has come to appreciate then we live in a sad, sad world. The movie is full of illogical concepts and clichés. Why in the world would the military spend trillions of dollars on a mega bot to destroy something it could easily destroy with a nuke??Furthermore, some people are impressed with the CGI in this movie? The movie basically looks like a cartoon. The monsters aren't scary or even remotely believable. For effective, believable use of CGI, refer to Lord of the Rings, Star Trek or King Kong.Perhaps my nine year old would like this movie, which i may comprehend.

WWF smack down with Sea Monsters and Robots,"Director Guillermo Del Toro is a big fan of robots or more correctly Jaegers, colossal metal beings controlled by two pilots within the machine itself, locked in a ""neural bridge"".The Jaeger program was created in response to the arrival of Kaiju, gigantic sea monsters popping out of fissures in the ocean at regular intervals. Kaiju are bad, very bad, Godzilla on super steroids with added attitude, they will ruin everyone's day unless they can be stopped.Earth is not doing so well, Kaiju are winning more often than not and the Jaeger program is losing favour and political backing, with crews being killed and robots destroyed.Humanity decides that building walls to keep the invaders out is better option, which seems odd bearing in mind the ease with which walls seem to get breached.No matter, we get to meet Raleigh Beckett (Charlie Haufman), a washed up ex-pilot who lost his older brother in battle, despite their celebrity status during the good old days, when the war was going humanity's way.Of course, following the requisite ""Earth needs you"" speech from the commanding officer (Idris Elba), we are back in business. This time with rookie pilot Mako Mori (Kikuchi), whose only qualification appears to be appealing to particular demographic and loyal Asian fan base. Local dialogue, with English subtitles indicates the contribution overseas box office now represents. We also have a nod to China, Russia and Australia to cover all the bases, no pun intended.Various obstacles are thrown in the new teams path, before they are allowed to go into battle and there are very few surprises worked into the formulaic screenplay. Throw in a couple of scientists attempting to mind meld with the Kaiju and a barely bothering to act Ron Perlman as a bizarre collector of Kaiju parts and you realise the train marked reality left some time ago.So with only Elba troubling the ""A-List"" star wattage meter and with a story cobbled together from a thousand fevered Manga and Anime dreams, the special effects needed to be top notch.Here the film does not disappoint, making ""Transformers"" look like the toys they really are and with a scale that is simply breathtaking. Building size robots dragging cargo ships to use as clubs to beat the oversized lizards into submission.Subtle, the film is not.Is it fun, to a point yes. If the subject matter interests you, then there is plenty of spectacle here and the CGI is state of the art. Dialogue is risible, apart from one line which is likely to bring more giggles than any patriotic response.Add an extra star if you are under 30, have enjoyed alcohol and are watching with friends.SummaryProvided you are looking for a movie where giant robots and sea monsters engage in WWF smackdown bouts, there is much to enjoy.If you are looking for depth, story and believable human interaction, then move swiftly along.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Well, another Godzilla Movie","I did not expect too much when I went to see this movie. And it was true, it reminded me of the good old Godzillas from the 70s, with a updated technique and a better sound. Anyway, I was not amazed and I hoped the movie comes to an end after about 1:45, but the finale was just what had to come. The final sequences were something in between Gandalf and Innerspace. At least I did not fall asleep while watching the movie, but I was not very amused. --- While I understand the requirements for a review, I think it is too strict, because some movies don't justify writing a set of ten lines about it. So this review should maybe be seen as a notice to the moderator and a thought about the reviewing rules on this website.

Remember that Guillermo Del Toro isn't Michael Bay !,"Giant monster vs giant robot blockbuster movie? sounds that it will be somekind of a transformers movie. Wait... it's directed by Guillermo Del Toro? I should consider to watch this because this could be AWESOME. And my decision was right to watch this, money and time well spent, this movie is a lot of fun. The characters were good, the acting was also quite well done, and don't even ask about the action? It's Spectacular! Well actually to be honest some of the actors were kind of over the top, but that's actually quite make sense. The action was not like transformers, it's very much better. This comes from a director can actually frame the action up, unlike Michael Bay that just puts action and action and explosions and we don't even know what's happening in the movie because it's not well done. Don't even dare to compare this to Transformers, because comparing Pacific Rim to Transformers is like comparing Jurassic Park to Theodore Rex. One of the best things about the movie is it's not just action, the characters are also important and interesting in this movie. We do care about the characters. Only very few directors that can pull this kind of movie off, this just proves how good Guillermo Del Toro is, as a director.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
too much going on ...,"The movie is solid and a very entertaining action flick. But it falls short on characters, not because there is too little plot but because there is too much cramped into the whole thing. And considering they are planning a sequel, I question why they didn't go for a trilogy in the first place. The story arc is compelling and the character development could be intriguing if it got some room to play out. But like it is, everything feels rushed and half baked. It's pretty much like Ender's Game. For me a great movie has time to show action, tell a good story and let characters engage the viewers thru the relationships between them - if they can't do it in 1 movie than go ahead and make it 2 or 3 movies. But when you go for such a first part and then try to sell me a sequel, I feel short changed.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"It wasn't great, a little stupid, but it was the most fun I've had with a movie in awhile","There's not much else that I can say other than giant robots punching kaijus (Giant monsters). I've watched kaiju films since I was a kid, and really, all pacific rim is, is a special effects leap. A very large one. Though other than that, don't expect to actually take anything away from the plot, we're just here to watch giant things punch each other. However, none of the chars were un-like able to the point where they were annoying, and even though there was close to no development, it sort of felt like there was something to lose if some of the pilots died. My final point is the soundtrack, which just makes everything feel more massive, from the guitar to the sirens of the jaeger. Over all, not much plot or characters, but this movie, was probably one of the coolest things I've seen.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An Adolescent boy's wet dream!,"Guillermo Del Toro has, first and foremost, been a visual director. Be it Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy or Hellboy 2 his level of visual flair is unsurpassed. More than that as evident from Pan's Labyrinth, he's also equally skillful in storytelling. Believe me Pan's Labyrinth is as twisted a simple fairytale can get. But he's had his fair share of hit and misses as well *cough* Don't be Afraid of the Dark *cough*. You know he's a good director when Peter Jackson himself chose Guilermo for directing The Hobbit trilogy. Unfortunately The Hobbit landed back in the hands of its own foster father than a step-dad. Its been 5 years since Guilermo's directed a movie. People thought he'd make a comeback with Hellboy but what came a surprise was Pacific Rim. First Look at its previews made me think ""oh yea, another Transformers clone"" but I was direly wrong. Pacific Rim is more than Michael Bay's Transformers, more than just an homage to Robots Vs Monsters movies as well.Pacific Rim is a nothing but glorified Power Rangers for adults movie, but it nevertheless entertain you. Basically its human-built giant robots, Jaegars, against giant alien monsters, Kaiju. What ensures is a huge huge robot on monster action with some drama sprinkled over the top. Pacific Rim, as soon as it starts puts you in the thick of action and clocking in at 132 minutes there was never a boring sequence. The writing was exactly what you'd expect in this genre. The lines were forced and at times very very clichéd but admit it you were neither in for performances or a plotyou were in for giant monsters vs giant robots and u get served pretty damn well and hot. The Drift was an interesting mechanic that serves as the backbone for the movie. Was a bit let down when other Jaegars didn't get enough screen-time as Gypsy Danger. Would have died to see the Russian one go a bit more. Most of the Kaiju encounters takes place at night and watching the movie in 3D felt a bit tedious as it was super dark I would have loved it if there was at least one head to head Kaiju fight in broad daylight. Then again the fight sequences were insanely detailed much much more than Transformers where we could only see blurs and metal scraps. Here in Pacific Rim each punch, each blow the Kaiju and Jaegers delivered was felt with equal force.Pacific Rim doesn't have a star-studded cast and it doesn't need one when the the plot is focused on Jaegars and Kaijus. Idris Elba had always stood out be it whatever roles he was in. He plays Stacker Pentecost and his sheer flamboyance does an amazing job here as well. I was particularly impressed with his ""Do not let my calm demeanour fool you, ranger!"" line. Rinko Kikuchi, as Mako Mari was good. I'd loved her in The Brothers Bloom where she delivered a solid performance without uttering a word. Her backstory here was touching, have to give kudos to the kid who played little Mako as well. It struck to me as vaguely similar to the Kim Phuc photo during the Viatnamese War. Comic relief by Charlie Day and Burn Gorman were good, it sometimes felt as cheesy but it was integral in this genre of movies. Guilermo's favorite Ron Perlman does a short role by name Hannibal Chau serving some chuckles. I was disappointed with the inadequate performance from the lead, Charlie Hunnam. Of course I've heard people saying his resemblance with Tron Legacy's Sam Flynn but thats just where the resemblances end. I just couldn't buy into his performance.Of course the real stars of Pacific Rim were the Jaegars and Kaiju and both were exquisitely detailed. Guillermo was never a stranger to monster designs, evident from some of the Hellboy and Pan Labyrinth monsters designed by himself.The Kaiju felt like intimidating hulking beasts of pure destruction and chaos and most of them modeled on monsterized versions of a shark, a gorilla etc. Loved them.Ramin Djawadi's score is pure spellbinding. I need not give an example more than Game of Throne's booming score. He does his magic again here with Pacific Rim. His score with the awesome visuals is enough to induce goosebumps. It leaves us in awe and beckons to be heard again and again. Tracks like 'Pacific Rim' and 'Gipsy Danger' is pure awesomeness.Pacific Rim is undoubtedly flawed in writing, performances and plot but it what it lacks there, it makes up with style, action and thrills. Pacific Rim isn't even close to Guillermo's Pan's Labyrinth or Hellboy in terms of storytelling but it excites you and it does give you an adrenaline rush watching the action packed fights and its more than any fanboy could ask for.

Pure 10-Year Old Fun,"Guillermo Del Toro is one of my favourite directors of all time, and for good reason. His films always feel so imaginative, his world building and designs so impressive. He knows how to build everything to create his own vision. Pacific Rim sounds like a stupid concept at first, and while the movie is dumb, it knows how seriously to take itself. Unlike the transformers movies which need to convince the audience that the movie is dark and gritty, this movie has fun, with vibrant colours and fun characters. These characters are not original or very unique but their fun tropes, like Star Wars characters. In fact, I am surprised so many dislike these characters but then love Star Wars. It's probably due to the development of these characters, but I think everyone is fleshed out as much as they need to be.People consider this a modern Star Wars, and I would have to agree with it. It uses other sources and cliches mixed together to create its unique universe like Star Wars does. This universe doesn't sound so unique, I mean tecchnically theres just giant robots and kaijus now, but all the details Del Toro puts into the universe elevates this world.Guillermo Del Toro of course knows how to deal with special effects, but I was anticipating ths movie due to budget, as Del Toro doesn't typically get a big blockbuster budget, even in the Hellboy movies. This movie looks beautiful, with a wide variety of locations. Again, this is so colourful compared to most blockbusters. This colour makes the film interesting to look at. The inside of the Jaegers, the different Kaijus and the look of the Shatterdome, Hong Kong and the rift are beautiful,I haven't talked about the action, mostly because surpisingly there isn't a lot in the film, which is what I love. In fact, there are only 3 fights in the movie, the first one not really even counting as a fight, more as an introduction. The 2nd set piece, which I will not spoil to anyone, is by far the highlight of the film. One thing that sets this movie apart from others is the action itself. The Jaegers aren't fast Michael Bay robots, they are slow, and so are they Kaijus. This, combined with the water that is always in these action scenes as rain or waves, gives this feeling of impact by seeing the robots slowly smash water particles rather than zoom across the screen just to look cool. This feeling of scale is just awesome, established in each shot, always making sure the Jaegers feel huge.Pacific Rim is a movie unlike so many blockbusters these days which try to give off this fake seriousness that the movie doesn't need. I wish more movies were like this, and more directors were as talented as Guillermo Del Toro.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Great Transformers/Godzilla Alternative,"Those who think that Transformers movies are awful will most likely praise Pacific Rim as being better in every single way, because it is. The film is directed by Guillermo Del Toro, who is one of the most consistent directors working today, and has cast full of perfectly capable actors/actresses. It is obvious that Del Toro was making this film for fun, and not for the awards season, since Pacific Rim does not have the overall tightness and quality that some of his other films have. Some of the acting is a bit questionable, and the script is far from special, which is especially apparent when Idris Elba gets some screen time. He is meant to be an military leader type character, and is the most generic one sided version of that character. Overall, the film is okay, but an excellent addition to the monster movie genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Entertaining, but could of been so much more","So Pacific Rim has finally landed on our screens. The Transformers Versus Godzilla, X-Men Sentinels Versus Cloverfield and monster versus robot hybrid action epic from Guillermo Del Toro. This film draws influences, whether by design or story, from a variety of sources. Not only from the above mentioned films but also Power Rangers and Robocop. It's like a mash-up of fabulous old telly, sci-fi fantasy stuff and a teenage boy's wet dream.If you've missed any of the 100 trailers or TV spots then ill recap the films story. It's not complicated and unfortunately predictable. Enormous reptilian monsters have risen from the deep and are threatening the world's major seaboard cities. Only colossal Transformers-style robots can save humanity and they have to be operated by pairs of warriors attuned to each other's mental processes.This is not Del Toro's best work. His best work relies on creepy, almost weird story telling. It lacks the subtle magic of Pan's Labyrinth, the creepiness of Cronos or the humour of Hellboy. What it is though is an absolutely loud and entertaining fighting robotical alien invasion apocalyptical type movie. It sells itself as nothing more and delivers just that.In short the castings a bit ropey, the accents are a bit off and it's a little too long for what's on offer. There's too much human story when we really don't need it and the films humour scenes were wide of the mark. We need robots. We need aliens and we need them to fight. A lot. When what we want is delivered its fantastic – its everything that Transformers isn't.The film also sets a back story that is briefly explained and allows serious prequel consideration, as should the thought of a sequel. It could have been so much better than it is, but it missed its mark by a whisker. Its good fun, good entertainment but the very high hopes I had for it failed to materialise.You can read more reviews like this at fortressofsolitude.co.uk",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The special effects are definitely the high point of the 131 minutes you are going to lose in your life if you decide to watch it. In some parts of the movie it looks like the viewer went back in time and is watching ""Power Rangers"" again. And not to mention the pointless dialog that go along all the scenes. If you are looking for more than special effects I strongly recommend to do not watch this crap, but if you really like this in a film, just watch Transformers or Battleship.

Man vs monster at it's best,"In the future time, there's giant monster called ""Kaiju"" which has risen from beneath of Pacific ocean and ready to overtake earth. Some teams try to beat the monster by jet and tank but it takes many days to defeat it. To level the combat, special forces from around the world build robots named ""Jaegers"". ""Jaegers"" is operated by 2 pilots whom minds are locked into one so they could move the robot based on their movement.""Spectacular"" is the best word to describe 'Pacific Rim'. All of the action scene is captured really detail from the fight in the water, land or even on sky although it seems length of the movie is too short for massive problems like that. They tells first Kaiju's attack in fast way and just skip through the existing of ""Jaegers"". Also there's a little bit let down in storyline about human. It feels too boring and standard in storyline which is unusual for a high class director like Guilermo del Toro. And one of the most fatal mistake is there are no well-known actor here who could support this movie and make it more commercial. The actors don't act bad though, but in a summer big-budget movie, they should hire at least one popular actor as main role. Overall 'Pacific Rim' is one of the most satisfying movie at this summer season, it's big, fantastic and fun. Most credit should be given to the special effects members who create the combat between robot and monster look real. Also the IMAX 3D is incredible and worth to see.

"interesting monsters, boring people","Robots versus monsters is a very Japanese thing, but that didn't stop an Italian director from making an English language version of one. The result is unfortunately closer in spirit to those old Godzilla movies than to the anime take on the genre. That is, there is little psychology or philosophy, even though the concept of two people working as one would seem to suit such things, and it takes itself quite seriously, with only a tiny bit of humor from some minor characters.The thing that makes this movie worth watching is the action, with some really cool monsters having big, fairly entertaining battles with giant robots. Unfortunately, the movie drags whenever it gets back to the human beings who control those robots. The square-jawed hero, the eager newbie, the cocky jerk, the tough commander, all feel like characters you create when you're too lazy to think. Two weird scientists bring a little humor to their scenes, but only Ron Perlman manages to really stand out in a small but entertaining role.Perhaps Del Toro should stick to Hellboy movies and leave the robot/monster fights to the Japanese",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Very entertaining, if your prepared for it!","I had to wait a certain amount of time, till I was ready to give this movie a try.When I first heard about Del Toro doing a NGE styled movie I was hooked. After the movie hit the theaters, opinions where mixed. A lot of people (me included) expected more from him, maybe something deeper and more refined.Had I watched the movie right after the release, I had given it a score of 4-5. But as time went by, I still liked the concept and a lot of friends said the usual stuff like ""you have to turn off your brain and enjoy the ride"" and I responded with ""Oh, is it that bad?"". I watched to many bad movies to waste my time with another one. But then a friend got hold of the Blue-ray and I watched it. I knew what I could and could not expect and the most important part, I accepted this for myself.I have to admit I enjoyed watching this movie! Nothing brilliant, no surprises, but in the end more then I hoped for and over two hours of visual stunning action. This movie certainly isn't boring! Why did it work for me this time around? Because the movie never tried to be more than it was. It doesn't take itself seriously and feels more like a comic with its share of humorous moments.The more important part for me was the revelation, that you can't rate a movie once and for all. Your life changes, your behavior changes and also your thinking. How many things do you like, just because you where there when they got created? How many of those things would you experience in a completely different way, if you would encounter them now, for the first time?",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Because the aliens are huge (pre historic days and behave like a drunk King Kong), governments from across the globe united to create an elite team to combat these aliens in the form of engineered robots (Jaegers) with distinct fighting gears. The catch is its mostly a two man vessel connected to a neural bridge. Huh? Since its a large robot one person serves as the right brain while the other the left. Their memories are merged and their brains (not literally) as well to serve as one main CPU for their android. To cut the story short, they need to kill the monsters (Kaiju) to save human race. To make it long, to top that we have a melodramatic lead actor and his sidekick, a drama queen as well. Too many characters playing certain roles to extend the movie more than two hours. It has too much testosterone that it felt like watching 300. Their plot may fall short but Ill give them two thumbs up for technicalities and attention to detail. When the movie ended, I wanted to be a Jaeger because I got moves like jagger (now laugh). Overall, it's a visual effects feast and what's interesting is our annoying seatmate whose queries are due to his disconnection from the movie. If only he was not sleeping. 3 out of 5 popcorns",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Great idea, bad acting and too short","First of all it's very important to say that the idea of this movie is great!!!!!It's the first time I'm so happy to see a story like this about monsters and Robots.BUT I WAS DISAPPOINTED by the performing : the dialogues are too much.If I was 14 years old, it COULD be the best movie of the year but unfortunately I'm not and you know exactly HOW IT's GONNA BE AND YOU KNOW the end of the movie 45 MINUTES BEFORE THE END..I think an idea like THAT SHOULD BE SPLIT IN 3 PARTS, SO THAT WILL GIVE US MORE DETAILS/MORE SUSPENSE....So yes the visuals effects are goods and the battles are pretty nice but all the other aspects of the movie are a shame",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Better or Worse Than Sharknado?,"The similarities between Pacific Rim and Sharknado go far beyond their lithe, telegenic screenplays and nuanced character-driven plots. Practically Shakespearean in their world-views and intricate family dynamics, both movies will keep you on the edge of your seat as plot twists have you guessing right up until the end on the big ""who done it"" question. Oh certainly, first-rate special effects added to well-crafted acting with so many layers of emotional depth you'd think its respective sea creatures were pipe-lined straight from Citizen Kane, or perhaps The Godfather, or maybe a bit of both. Really, who's to say which picture will garner the most Golden Globes or Academy Awards this year. My bet's on ILM's splendorous work in Pacific Rim although I've got to say Sharknado's sharks really projected tremendous amounts of fear-inducing horror that weren't quite the equal of the more anime-inflected denizens of Pacific Rim. I suggest you see both films in a double feature and decide for yourself.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fun flick,"Del Toro knows how to turn campy genres into meaningful stories - Pan's Labyrinth, Shape of Water - and Pacific Rim takes steps in that direction. It doesn't fully achieve it - the action is expected, you care less about the characters - but it's still enjoyable and exceeded my expectations.Excited for Pacific Rim: Uprising!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Terrific Rim...at Times.,"""We always thought alien life would come from the stars, but it came from deep beneath the sea"". In fact, director Guillermo del Toro brought new life to the monster movie genre with the epic and undeniably entertaining Pacific Rim right here on land.Pacific Rim delivers just about what one might expect from seeing its trailers or even just hearing about it. Guillermo del Toro's vision is complex in its ambition and scale, but simple enough in its high-concept premise. When the Pacific Ocean receives an unwelcome portal between dimensions, alien life invites itself into our world and certainly doesn't wish to remain unnoticed as mass destruction of Earth's infrastructure ensues. In response, the Jaeger Project is born, creating monsters of our own to combat the deadly, in a sense, subterranean species. Del Toro immediately invites us into his multidimensional universe, with the cinema screen acting as the portal where for 131 minutes you are transported on a journey of majestic imagery.The initial 30 minutes in this new universe, (a universe which is only further enhanced by the third dimension and IMAX experience) is unfortunately spent telling us what we probably already know. There are certain films where you wish you had known less going in as surprises are spoiled by your anticipation and natural assumptions. Pacific Rim differs in no way and in fact could have benefited from more constructive and ambiguous pre-released material as its opening half- hour is more or less an extended version of the trailers. As with most stories however, judgment should really be reserved until its middle and end have executed their purpose.Pacific Rim is effortlessly enjoyable, tie-in toyable, with monsters and robots readily deployable into battle sequences so convincing and grand, that you look up to the screen as you would these monsters in real life and this makes Del Toro rightly employable.While the action has you synchronised unbreakably with Del Toro's vision due to the prowess of the CGI, which just feels like I alone, you cannot help but wish for the camera to take a giant step backwards. Although obviously done intentionally, Del Toro leaves the camera awkwardly in between the action at times, and the result is perplexing. With films such as Jaws (1975) and Cloverfield (2008), the devastating creatures are purposefully obscure visually and shown infrequently to heighten the sense of danger and fear of the unknown. Meanwhile, with Jurassic Park (1993) and other similar creature features, we are monstrously engaged and aesthetically informed by being able to see the action and nonhuman characters clearly afar when necessary. Pacific Rim is uncomfortably framed in between this spectrum at times and this unfortunately lessens the visual value and experience of the film overall.While the battle sequences are the most anticipated, decorated and appropriately stated highlights of Pacific Rim, they are only setpieces to the much bigger war. The primary point of interest away and even importantly within the action is the film's central theme of unification. Seeing the abandonment of international conflicts, petty feuds and meaningless separation between Earth's people holds a great deal of truth to it when faced with a common enemy. Del Toro maintains this theme consistently throughout the feature, with the giant Jaeger robots even requiring a coalition between two pilots emotionally and cerebrally to function capably.While puny individual Earthlings are thrown in for purposes of making the film grounded and recognisable, it's really the robots and aliens you came to see. Nonetheless, Idris Elba and the brief yet excellent performance of child actress Mana Ashida stand out chiefly even when facing the immeasurable monsters at their doors.Pacific Rim is quite literally a groundbreaking feat in cinematic excellence because Guillermo del Toro immerses his audience into his world, his galaxy, his universe with relative ease, and the goal to please, which he achieves. While it has its flaws and calculates its fair share of question marks for itself, Pacific Rim is difficult to deny as anything but entertainment. It's simple, it's smashing, its scale is felt with incredible zealous. It's Pacific Rim.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A less exciting story wrapped in immensely exciting CGI,"The film begins with the introduction of a species of monstrous creatures from another universal dimension which did not really feel like a proper background introduction to the plot which basically is the fact that the origin of the story is quite messy.

action packed,"This movie was like another version of Transformers, this time with alien/sea monsters doing the attacking. The aliens, aka Kaiju, have come from the ocean instead of the sky; There is a breach that leads to another dimension. And for some reason, the Kaiju only come 1 by 1 and months apart instead of sending in a whole bunch at one time. How does that make sense? You attack with numbers. And ways as you can see this movie requires the viewer to suspend a lot of common sense in order to enjoy.Humans have built giant ""Transformers"", aka Jaeger, to battle the aliens. It takes 2 people to operate the Jaeger. So our hero, Becket, has lost his brother in battle and gets recruited again for one last attempt to stop the Kaiju. He goes to Hong Kong where there are only 4 Jaeger left. Some Kaiju show up and we get another big battle. The general has a plan to end it all by blowing up the breach.Overall, it was a good action flick if you overlook the loop holes in the story and all reality. The special effects were really good, which is what made the film.FINAL VERDICT: a good choice for a popcorn flick",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Power rangers on crack (cracks in plot and logic too),"Yah! Amazing show of visual effects and editing artistry, and cool booklike story, and i wish i saw this in the movies with better sound ""oomph"" effects, with also better picture quality, but still... The plot has plenty holes and logic faults, even in the jaeger designs which i didnt like.This could had been a great 9/10 movie, but the storypath and plot thinking failed a lot.Personally i feel this would had been much better if Makos childhood story was introduced straight in the beginning. And then the brothers.Also most of the kaijus have been closed combat creatures able to swim well... So why werent ALL jaeger designs made to have mostly underwater fighting design? And also barely any of them have melee combat advantage, only the chinese brothers jaeger had the circular saws and the older unit swords but...Theres SO MANY strong closed combat weapons in our history that could had been used on the jaegers design or copied our planets animals weaponry to use on the robots melee weaponry. And clearly kaijus could had been all killed essily at their entrance hole just by using nukes underwater nukes?Imagination should had been used more freely in this world where apparently resources to build these robots and giant walls is not very demanding.Oh and what bothered me most in the dna reading ending, was that wasnt it supposed to be reading every pass through the ""gate""?Just alot of logic faults.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Overview of Awesomeness,"Jaegers: enormous metallic giants with missiles, mega-swords, and nuclear engines. Kaiju: even more enormous scaly monsters that rise from the ocean floor and do battle with Jaegers. What more do you need to know? That Guillermo del Toro is the director? That seeing 50 story robots using boats as weapons is pure adrenaline?The soundtrack is an amazing mix of old and new, lending it's self to classic Japanese monster movies and to modern action classics at the same time. Guillermo is an artist and a painting is what he has made with this movie. Just like a painting you bring to it your own set of interpretations and prejudices. For me this movie represented all the things I watched growing up and more, It was the summation of every giant Robo/monster flick ever made.Plot? Plenty to go around and if it was a bit cliché? As I said, this painting allows you to bring your own set of preconceptions to it. I saw it for what it was, an homage to those that went before and those that will be able to take the torch and carry it on. This is not your Power Rangers or Voltron and it sets the bar so high I doubt even Godzilla can survive without taking some points away from this piece of art.Art?

Perfunctory over-sophistication with clichés,"As we know, Guillermo del Toro is fond of fantasy and visual effects, and state-of-the-art technology enables him to provide more flashing scenes and fights - regretfully at the expense of pithiness and novelty. Similar monsters, equipment, fights, reasonings, types of characters (politically correct approach of different races and ages) etc. have been visible in dozens of movies - so is the ending, typical to Hollywood blockbusters. Bearing in mind the development of technology in recent decades, it is still odd why there are still so many Godzilla and transformer figures in movies! And you can easily guess which characters survive and who lose their lives... As for the cast, only Idris Elba and Ron Perlman give decent performances, the rest is gray zone, no catchy moments, just trivial solutions of trivial types...A kind of entertainment appraised likely by video gamers, but without offering new elements to the history of cinema.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Michael Bay, Please Watch This Movie!","So the story is aliens have invaded earth, in monster form, and humans have built gigantic robots for defending themselves and fighting the aliens (kaiju). Once again, del Toro doesn't disappoint in visual effects at all, I think his sound department also has done a great job. The action scenes, they look awesome, you get engaged in them quickly and get excited for them, it's actually how the movie starts and then the title comes after 17 minutes (which I really liked that, because it set up the tone of the movie before anything officially gets started). However, series of denial decisions happen by different characters that none of them makes sense at all; in fact it creates some frustration. Besides that, the two scientists are just too cartoonish, which I guess they're meant to be there to create some humor, but in my opinion it makes the movie cheesy. About being cheesy, the ending should have been better (maybe I should blame it on the studio?), however what I like about the story is, it's not a commercial movie for national guard, army, navy, air force or anything like that, it's not USA saving the world, and I really dig that. The performances are decent, Idris Elba absolutely owned this movie, he definitely doesn't seem to be a supporting role, Charlie Hunnam whom I had seen for the first in Green Street Hooligans is great as well, but Charlie Day to is a little annoying here, I can't really blame it on his performance, again his role is just too cartoonish. Also regarding the soundtrack, it's decent and good enough for the movie, however my expectations from Ramin Djawadi has been raised since Game of Throne's latest season soundtrack was just amazing.Overall, if you're going to this movie for the battle scenes, you'll enjoy the feck out of it, in that case the movie would get slow at some points, and if you expect some amazing story here, you'd be disappointed. Even that, the movie is still entertaining; I give it 7.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Predictable, cluttered CGI spectacular","Monsters (""kaiju"") are rising from the ocean floor and mankind's only hope are giant fighting robots (""jaegers""). Formulaic from beginning to end ""Pacific Rim"" is a tour-de-force visual extravaganza backgrounding a predictable, cliché'd story. Much of the imagery moves so quickly that it is difficult to tell what is happening (other than yet another big fight is underway). The ""kaiju"" were sufficiently similar looking and hard to scale that you had to be constantly told that the next one was bigger and badder (and they all looked like they had recently gargled with glowstick liquid). The big mechas were more interesting, with imagery reflecting the pop-culture that popularised the term 'kaiju' (I had 'Voltron' flashbacks), but the constant glare made them difficult to appreciate. The film contains lots of filler (training fights, a side trip to find a kaiju brain, etc) buttressing a minimal story and the script is mostly tough guy posturing, especially at the end, when every character seems to heroically say 'goodbye' several times. As is not uncommon in the genre, the story seemed to be written around the imagery rather than vice-versa, but generally, the state-of-the-art CGI was sufficiently impressive to keep me watching (and rewatching).",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Pacific Rim Review,"Guillermo Del Toro's Pacific Rim is a movie that the 10 year old in all of us wants to see. The film is action packed and what makes this movie even more awesome is that a majority of the fight scenes are between giant robots and giant aliens. While the acting wasn't the greatest in Pacific Rim, the special effects and originality of the story overcome the bad acting to make an awesome film that is fun for all ages.Before getting into these intense action scenes, the film first develops a backstory that explains to the audience what is happening. There are these gigantic monsters that are known as Kaiju (Japanese for ""monster"") and they are invading Earth via a portal that is located deep in the Pacific Ocean (hence the name of the film). In order to combat these the nations of the world work together to build giant robots known as Jaegers (German for ""hunter"") and these are piloted by two people (three in one robot) whose minds are melded in ""the Drift"". With the Jaegers the Kaiju are becoming less of a threat, so much so that they are turned into toys. It isn't until the Kaiju become stronger and appear more frequently that the real story begins.The film suffered a bit from the acting. While the performances from Idris Elba, Ron Perlman, Charlie Day, and to some extent Burn Gorman, were phenomenal, many others were not. Idris Elba's acting really stands out in the film. Many of the other performances, especially Charlie Hunnam, were pretty bad and almost cringe-worthy. Many of the lines that come out of Charlie Hunnam's mouth are just terrible, not only in terms of the actual lines, but also the way that he says them. Two of his lines that come up immediately in the film, ""Tendo. What's happening my man?"" and ""You're gonna get your ass kicked"" are not only lame lines, but the way that he says them is very monotonous and it's impossible to infer any emotion from them. He's about to go out and fight a Kaiju and it's impossible to tell how the character is feeling. Even his facial expressions are bland, I couldn't tell whether what he was feeling at any point during the movie. Fortunately, not all of the acting is as bad as Hunnam's. Idris Elba is probably the film's best actor and it really shows in his character Stacker Pentecost. Right before the major battle in the film, when Elba gives his ""canceling the Apocalypse"" speech not only does he sound inspiring, but you can even see the emotion in his facial expressions. During that speech I couldn't help but get pumped to kick some alien butt.The entire film relies on the look of the Kaiju and Jaegers; fortunately, Del Toro spared no expense on the special effects and this is where the film really shines. It becomes evident in the first 10 minutes of the film that the special effects are outstanding. Unlike other movies that rely heavily on special effects (see Transformers) the special effects in ""Pacific Rim"" are perfect. Even in the dark rainy fight sequences it is still possible to understand what is going on and who is fighting who. While the fight sequences in ""ransformers were confusing and overfilled with explosions, the fight scenes in Pacific Rim are intense, but easy to comprehend.Pacific Rim, although it isn't going to win any Oscars, it still is an extremely enjoyable movie. The acting and script aren't extraordinary by any means, but that wasn't to be expected seeing what the movie is about. What really makes the movie are the special effects. By going into it expecting to see intense fight scenes between giant robots and aliens one can't but be impressed by the film.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Big Badass Blockbuster in your face!,"I watched this because it looked badass; I'll be honest.First off, let me say that this movie has some of the best graphics and visuals of any film in history to date. The fight scenes in this, during 2013, are like when you watched Jurassic Park in the mid 90s. It's just so good, so amazing, on a godlike scale, that it gets at least an 8/10 fresh out the gate.The story is pretty cool, but the family angle is played at a little bit, so some cheesy stuff is in the mix (girl like boy, boy has a bully rival, boy fight rival for girl, boy get girl). But it actually is badass how the overall story is made somehow acceptable. It is like Avatar - super far fetched, but everything is logical and in order, so you completely buy it.Everything was amazing, you have to see it if you like any movies at all. Only reason I didn't give it a 10, was because the writing could perhaps have been a little better. There was a scene with a 5-10 minute hand to hand battle between a giant alien monster, and one of the human guided Voltrons. Blow for blow, it is like a Mike Tyson fight. And then literally, when Voltron is about to lose the fight, one of the Voltron pilots says something like ""Oh yea, we have this giant sword that can pop out of the arm"".... and it does, and they kill the alien with one swing... Things like that, are not necessary evils that blockbusters with simple plot lines must lug around - that's what they want us to think. Good writing can always tie a fictional story together.But you can get past that - and you will, because it still is so far beyond 99% of all movies ever made, that you will permanently see life differently after watching it.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The Cool Bots and Action Could Only Help So Much,"With Pacific Rim Uprising about to be released I felt compelled to watch its predecessor if I'm going to watch the Uprising.Pacific Rim reminds me a lot of Robotech, a cartoon I used to watch a bit as a kid. At its core, Pacific Rim is an alien invasion movie not too unlike Independence Day. Earth is being serially attacked by these humongous creatures from another dimension coined Kaiju (which is Japanese for Monster). The world forces pooled their resources to create machinery to combat these Kaiju and they coined these mega machines Jaegers (German for giant). The Jaegers, operated by human pilots, dutifully protect the planet until the Kaiju become too much to handle. That's when they need real heroes.If it weren't for the action this movie would be a total waste because the story and the dialog is extremely unimaginative. The script and the acting even is sophomoric and has no real depth. Fortunately they had extra cool robots to take our attention away from the story. But even the action got to be overdone. It became destruction porn. Large cities being easily ripped apart by giant aliens and their pursuers--that gets old. How many movies with mega-beings or super-beings are going to lay waste to cities? I can only stand to see so many buildings destroyed before it all looks the same.The robots were nice, the creatures were nice but everything else was mediocre at best; the characters, the drama, the acting. This could've been a short film and been more effective.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Shouldn't be as enjoyable as it ultimately is.,"There's this niggling yet unshakeable sense that 'Pacific Rim (2013)' shouldn't be as enjoyable as it ultimately is, seeing as though the dialogue (along with most acting) is eye-rollingly ham-fisted, in a corny kind of way, and the set-up itself is cringe-inducingly clichéd. Yet the picture picks itself up around half-way through and comes barrelling in to be an ultimate guilty-pleasure. The expertly rendered robot-suits battle it out in the cities and seas to usually eye-pleasing results, and it's actually a pretty fun ride even though you know it's stupid, and perhaps it even knows it itself. Not quite 'turn your brain off', but definitely 'ignore that whiny voice of cinematic reason'. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Skip all the dialog and I'd give it a 10,"Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, Brian Cranston, and freakin' Guillermo del Torro. How can you possibly say no to a team like that?It was probably names like these, combined with the gritty, neon- mecha aesthetic, that made you decide to watch this movie. That being said, the movies writers, producers, and even lead actors were almost completely useless. The characters are forced, the plot is stupid, and none of it will inspire a single interesting thought. If I could, I would have literally cut every scene without Godzilla, Kaiju, or Jaegers. But the fight scenes... Sweet Zombie Jesus, those beautiful fight scenes. If anything, this movie is a testament to what a visionary director can do with a ton of good CGI.As del Toro admits in behind-the-scenes footage, almost all of the film's basic concepts are ripped off of mecha anime. That being said, the details of the fight scenes are breath-takingly original. Every light reflecting off Godzilla's reptilian body, every nuclear- powered Jaeger footstep, every building that explodes into millions of virtual pieces, every volcanic glow behind leathery Kaiju wings. It is all meticulously designed to maximize visual pleasure. This is eye-candy that hasn't been seen by cinema thus far.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
