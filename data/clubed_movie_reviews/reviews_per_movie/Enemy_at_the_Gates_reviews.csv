Historially accurate? No. Entertaining? Absolutely!,"If you go into this film hoping for an historically accurate portrayal of the battle of Stalingrad then go watch a documentary, if you are however looking to be entertained by an action packed and gritty WW2 movie set in the city of Stalingrad, then go ahead and pick this up because it's nothing if not entertaining.The movie is about the real life sniper Vasily Zaitsev played by Jude Law and his exploits during the famous battle, the beginning of the movie is complete chaos as our main hero is sent to the front and we see the besieged and infamous city for the first time. It's honestly worth watching this movie just for the opening scene alone which is just incredibly well done in all aspects and portrays some of the horrors that the soviet troops would have witnessed when arriving there.Overall this is a highly entertaining war movie, fantastic CGI for the time, everything is well shot, the set pieces are gorgeous and even the acting and characters are well done.All that said this is of course a Hollywood production, don't expect much in the way of historical accuracy and definitely expect a silly love story (though not the worst) and everyone speaking English with poor Russian and German accents.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A fascinating film about the strategy of two great snipers,"In ""Enemy at the Gates,"" the future of the greatest battle of World War II, would be decided between a young Russian sniper and an aristocratic sharpshooter from Germany sent to kill him Jude Law and Ed Harris sit for hours waiting for the right moment It was a duel set in the siege of Stalingrad Stalingrad was one of the biggest and bloodiest battles of World War II, and in the midst of this huge battle, these two soldiers were hunting each other downThe film opens with the harrowing transport of thousand of Russian soldiers across the Volga River to Stalingrad The recruits were packed onto steamers, barges, whatever they could find to ferry them across the river All that under a deluge of shells, bombs and explosionsBy the time Vassili arrives to Stalingrad, the Nazis have a distinct edge, and Soviet morale is at an all-time lowLeading the Russians in their seemingly futile defense is Nikita Kruschev, played by Bob Hoskins The Germans, at that time, were overrunning the place and the Russians were in an appalling state It was the most awful battle of the warJoseph Fiennes plays Danilov, an idealistic Russian officer who passionately speaks about his belief in getting the troops to turn the grave situation in Stalingrad around He finds the perfect inspiration in VassiliRachel Weisz plays a young woman who volunteers to help in the war effort She's literally protecting the people she grew up with When she meets Vassili, he just has a natural intelligence, a natural instinctJude Law is remarkable as the young sharpshooter Vassili Zaitsev who conveyed both humanity and intensity There's such a fierce intelligence and liveliness in his eyes He can also be very quiet and internal Vassili found the complexity within the silence and stillness In fact to be a sniper is very much about a man of action through stillness Vassili represented the ultimate hero, the symbol of someone who could instill hope and belief in victory amongst the troops, because his skills as a sniper were unparalleledEd Harris played Major Konig, the German sharpshooter sent to hunt down Vassili He knows that Vassili was picking off German officers with some regularity, and was becoming a folk hero for the Russian soldiers as well as the Russian populace... He decided to eliminate himThe casting of Ed Harris opposite Jude Law resulted in a striking visual link between their characters They both have these unbelievably penetrating blue eyes And director Jean-Jacques Annaud began to see the duel through their eyes And one of the first shots of Ed Harris was a close-up of his blue eyesAnnaud painted the tensions very clearly and concentrated purely on the eyes of the Jude Law and Harris and, of course, on their rifles and how they were hidden and what they were doing Basically, the core of his camera is the duel of their eyes, duel of men, duel of snipers, therefore a confrontation of people that scan the surrounding buildings, and try to decipher what they see",8.0,Anonymous,History
Easily the best thing that has come out all year...,"It would be all too easy to dismiss Enemy At The Gates as being an attempt to cash in on Saving Private Ryan's success, but in my opinion, it is a very worthy competitor. In fact, it is a better film. I say that primarily because I am sick to death of Americans using World War II as a basis for films that generally amount to little more than propaganda. Of course, Enemy At The Gates comes off as being somewhat fantastic due to its attempt to balance entertainment with historical fact, and it came as a surprise to me to learn that Sergeant Vassili Zaitsev was a real person (whose sniper rifle is still an exhibit in a Russian museum), but this makes it all the more entertaining to watch.A lot of historians have it that the battle of Stalingrad was the most unpleasant one fought during the second World War, and this film's set design and cinematography capture that impeccably. When the Russians are battling the Nazis, you get the idea that if the Nazis didn't kill them, malnutrition, tetanus, scurvy, bubonic plague, or a million other things would. Jude Law and Joseph Fiennes lend authenticity to their roles that makes it even easier to follow them on their personal journey through hell, and Ed Harris is scarily convincing as a high-ranking Nazi. The real surprise here, however, is Rachel Weisz as Sergeant Tania Chernova, and the very heart and soul of the film. When she describes the reasons why she decided to take up a gun and battle the Germans, it all makes so much sense that you just want to buy the poor girl a beer and give her a good warm embrace. Not that such things would erase the scars that her character bears, but one would feel obligated to try.Writer/Director Jean-Jacques Annaud, writer Alain Goddard, and cinematographer Robert Fraisse treat the subject matter with great care towards authenticity and entertainment value. It's very tricky to get these two things in proper sync, but they more than manage here. They also don't rely on any hokey photographic effects to tell the story, simply letting you see everything as clearly as possible, letting your imagination do the rest. Anyone who's read anything credible about the inhuman suffering the Russian soldiers endured during this battle will have no trouble filling in the gaps that the narrative leaves about their living conditions. The blood and gore shown during the battles is also very conducive to the atmosphere. Rather than just expecting you to believe that a solider gets his stomach spread all over half a kilometer of pavement by enemy bullets, they show you so you can get a feel for how bloodthirsty both sides in the confrontation were. Even the sex scene doesn't look out of place here.To make a long story short, this is the first film I've seen in a long, long time that I haven't been able to come up with a list of criticisms for. It is simply excellent, and the 7.1 rating it is currently stuck with does not do it justice. It is easily superior to the likes of Platoon, the equal of more esoteric war films such as Three Kings, and it is miles above the likes of Saving Private Ryan and Pearl Harbour. Vassili Zaitsev would be very happy that his struggle has inspired such a commendable piece of art - it is exactly the sort of thing he and millions of others like him (on both sides of the planet) were fighting for.",10.0,Anonymous,History
brilliantly flawed ... is still brilliant,"In the grand tradition of Old Hollywood, this international co-production seeks to frame the key battle of WW2 (the REAL key battle, not the ones from the John Wayne movies) as a morality tale involving a love triangle.It is a bold idea, and beautifully executed.In fact an argument could be made -- and I will make it -- that any flaws in the execution (it lags a bit here and there) are the result of the film-makers' ""reach exceeding their grasp"" and they attempted too much, more than one film could ever accomplish.But what a film it is! You viewer feel as though you are there, making history. The four stars involved have, each of them, never given a bad performance in their careers and they surely maintain their records here.Ed Harris in particular -- although he has less screen time -- will always to this reviewer seem a vastly under-rated actor. (This review written in 2017 where an older Harris still uses his charisma in a defining role for HBOs Westworld .... and nails it.) Recommended? Absolutely! In the Metacritic data that IMDb so helpfully provides I could not help but notice one reviewer commenting that, well, it sure isn't in the same class as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.Which is the irony of doing film reviews. I have never not once thought of wanting to see SAVING PRIVATE RYAN again, but this film is one I like to revisit every few years. Magnificent.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"A Taut, Gritty War Movie Screaming to Come Out of a Drekky Melodrama","I went to see ""Enemy at the Gates"" with my husband, as I knew it was about his favorite battle of his favorite war that he watched continually on the Military Channel. After having to endure a harangue the whole way to the screen about how we would be seeing the real battle that won the war, not that inconsequential D-Day that ""Saving Private Ryan"" made such a big deal about as the U.S. didn't come in until the Russians already had turned the tide, I asked could he please be quiet during the movie and refrain from commenting on inaccuracies, etc. until after.But other than the clarification I needed between the Battle of Leningrad and the Siege of Stalingrad which I always mix up (whoops, I think I just did it again), and Hitler's and Stalin's fallacies as military leaders in relation to the symbolic importance of the Volga (and the movie could have used more strategic explanations), he and I pretty much agreed about the movie.There's a taut, gritty war movie screaming to come out of a drekky melodrama. The best parts are the battles, of troops and individuals. The opening sequence of soldiers thrown from trains to boats to the front line is terrific and frightening.The one-on-one between Ed Harris's Nazi sharpshooter and Jude Law's hunter (though he doesn't do working class too convincingly) is exciting.The most captivating surprising is Bob Hoskins as Krushchev. He completely inhabits the character and brings him completely to blood and guts life - showing just what it takes to survive as a top man to Stalin.There was also more potential in Joseph Fiennes' political officer as insight into propaganda that is only occasionally effective (after all, ""Ryan"" was similarly about a PR stunt).I thankfully dozed off during most of the ridiculous sub-plot of the love triangle. There appears to be only a couple of women living in this city, and they sure do get in the way, as these few can themselves provide multi-lingual translations, sex, food, lousy child care and brave sharpshooting.The music by James Horner is atrociously bombastic, wincibly so.(originally written 3/31/2001)",6.0,Anonymous,History
compelling war movie,"It's the fall of 1942. Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law) grew up hunting with his father in the woods. He, Tania (Rachel Weisz) and countless other untrained recruits are brought up to the front at Stalingrad. He and Commisar Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) survive a suicidal charge. Vassili kills 5 Germans in the aftermath and Danilov writes about him. Nikita Khrushchev (Bob Hoskins) seizes the opportunity to make him a star. Opposing him is the aristocratic German sniper Major König (Ed Harris).The opening is an amazing opera of mass destruction. Then it's a matter of a chess game. It's a fascinating cat and mouse game in the ruins of the city. I'm glad that nobody decided to talk in a fake Russian accent. That would be too distracting. This is a rare good American war movie not about Americans.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Takes a few wrong turns, but ends up effective for people in which it sounds interesting. Good performances. *** (out of four)","ENEMY AT THE GATES / (2001) *** (out of four)By Blake French:""Enemy At The Gates"" takes place in 1942 and details a cat and mouse chase between two snipers. The mouse is a young Russian named Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law), who arrives on the shores of the Volga River to defend Stalingrad, an important city in which the German's are attempting to capture. Zaitsev soon finds himself befriending a political officer named Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), who is impressed by the soldiers quick skills and decides to glorify him through the local press. Zaitsev becomes a political icon for the locals, giving them encouragement and increasing their hope for victory.The cat is an opposing sniper named Major Koenig (Ed Harris), a famous sharpshooter called upon to kill Zaitsev. Koulikov (Ron Perlman), another talented sniper, is assigned to help Zaitsev in killing Koenig before the Major takes a victory shot. To further complicate matters, Zaitsev falls in love with another soldier, Tania (Rachel Weisz), whose parents were killed by the enemies, and wants to redeem their honor.""Enemy At The Gates"" certainly paints a vivid, graphic depiction of war. The atmosphere is unsettling and bleak, the characters are almost always dirty and sleepless, the fighting scenes consist of brief, short, instantaneous shots, but the sequences are fast-paced, genuine, and disturbing. The city looks battered and tormented. The dialogue goes hand and hand with the character's actions; the plot is challenging and the movie is focused, about something solid. In the sequences where Koenig and Zaitsev challenge one another, the tension is very effective. The movie tends to realize that, and concentrates a great deal of effort in making those scenes suspenseful and taut.Joseph Fiennes plays a meek, nervous character and does a good job at bringing him to life believably. Jude Law, whose last work in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" provides a tough act to follow, accomplishes great things with a determined and assiduous character. Ed Harris is the standout actor here, in a harrowing, steadfast, juicy performance. Rachel Weisz cannot do a whole lot with her character, however. She often feels strained and contrived.""Enemy At The Gates"" tries hard to express the subject of the media's influence in our culture. If the film, co-written and directed by Jean-Jaques Annaud  (""Seven Years in Tibet""), would have stayed on that concept, it would have been a whole lot better. The romance between Zaitsev and Tania is kind of unnecessary, and I am not sure if the sex scene is obligatory or advances their relationship. This love side story lacks passion; a lot of it feels mechanical and routine. ""Enemy At The Gates"" is still a consistently intriguing war film-rare because it does not involve Americans. While we are never really concerned about the outcome of the actual war, nor do we entirely care about several aspects of the main characters, there are many good scenes of suspense, and the overall mood of the movie is effective. ""Enemy at the Gates"" is worth seeing if it sounds interesting to you.",7.0,Anonymous,History
An extrordinary work of raw skill and imagination.,"A gut-wrenching and impressive hide-and-seek thriller that uses the bloody battle of Stalingrad (during the second World War) as the clever disguise here for a real battle of courage and determination.  The film follows a young and highly talented Russian sniper from the Urals, Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law - ""eXistenZ"", ""The Talented Mr. Ripley""), who gains national fame from the help of Danilov (Joesph Fiennes - ""Shakespeare in Love""), a propoganda officer and his true love and fellow sniper, Tania (Rachael Weisz), who is also flirting with Danilov.However, the Germans have an ace sniper of their own in Erwin Koning (Ed Harris - ""Pollock""), a seasoned and out-spoken Major who comes to Stalingrad only to pick off Vassili.  And before Koning leaves, his superior officer asks how he'll find Vassili.  Koning says, "" I'll fix it so he finds me.""The love triangle that director Jean-Jacques Annaud and co-writer Alain Godard put in the story shows that the pair took a chance and I'll give them credit for doing it.  Plus, the love scene that Law and Weisz have is one of the strangest (no offense to either one) that I've seen.The film's best moments come when Vassili tries to catch Koning off guard, but the problem is Koning is aware of what Vassili is capable of.   I won't say how it's done, but the final confrontation is a genuine nail-bitter.All of the performances here are powerhouse and that includes Bob Hoskins as Nikita Kruschev, a snarling and impatient man and Ron Perlman, who portrays Koulikov, a lieutenant whose teeth are all metal and serves as a guide for Vassili.Robert Frassie (""Ronin"") handles the movie's photography with care and the appearrence of Stalingrad itself reminded me heavily of the war-torn cities shown in Spielsburg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" and Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"".  Also, James Horner conducts a tender and extremely mournful score that leaves a quiet yet important reminder of how awful war is.""ENEMY AT THE GATES"" is an extrodinary work of raw skill and imagination.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Should Have Been Much Better,"This was a pretty solid World War II story but wasn'tas good as I hoped. It's still definitely worth a look and worth collecting if you like Word War II movies. Speaking of looks, this film got panned for its cinematography by some national reviewers because it was ""too bland,"" but that was deliberate. It's a bland topography and a somber story.To me, it was refreshing to see a modern-day war movie with little profanity. It was supposed to be a true-life account of a Russian and German sniper going after each other. With that premise, it sounded like a taut thriller.Something was missing with this film, even though it had it's tense moments. Most of the story, not just the scenery, is drab and it takes a toll on the viewer after awhile. Perhaps it's the believability of the characters. There was no attempt by the filmmakers to have their actors sound plausible. For instance, Jude Law, Joseph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz all play Russians.....with a British accent! Ed Harris plays a German with an American accent! Come on! Everyone sounded so phony it took away from the story.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Opening the gates of my mind,"At first glance I must admit I thought ""Oh no!"" not another war movie trying to cash in on the success that Saving Private Ryan had. However when I viewed this film it turned out to be a great surprise in my mind. Its the story of a man brought to fame in a form of propaganda to help the disintegrating Russian forces keep faith. The boy (Law) was obviously talented however nearly lost his own faith when poised against his greatest challenge, the prized German sniper. The story line throughout kept me glued to the screen leading up to a wonderful climax.The wonder of friendship and love also have a great deal in the plot and realistically portrays both in those times of chaos and death. I urge any reader who is doubting this films credentials to swallow their pride and sit down to watch this film. You will not be disapointed in the least.In saying this I would like to just add that I feel there could have been improvement in the accents as sometimes I was finding it hard to grasp that the Germans were fighting the Russians and not the English, but otherwise 10 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Good Film But No Classic Epic,"I liked ENEMY AT THE GATES , but its flaws are very obvious . First of all is Rachel Weisz who makes a very unconvincing Soviet heroine with a very distracting upper class English accent , I guess this is to make the film more marketable to a potential female audience along with the inclusion of a love triangle which is slightly unnecessary and underdeveloped ( Witness the scene where it looks like Danilov is going to have the hero arrested as an enemy of the state and this is never followed up ? ) and did we really need to have the inclusion of a sex scene ? These small problems  spoil the film somewhat and stops it becoming a classic epicNot to be negative I really did like this film for two reasons . First up is the portrayal of snipers . Once upon a time snipers were considered as being amongst an army`s bravest most competant warriors . This is still true today of course but media attention via such conflicts in Northern Ireland , the Balkans and the middle east and even recent events in America means "" Sniper "" is a word people associate with cold hearted murdering thugs and EATG rightly dispells this modern day myth. Secondly EATG shows us all something that is rarely seen to a western audience and that is the horror of the Eastern front during the Second world war . Hollywood would have us believe America won the second world war single handed but it was mainly the courage and sacrifice of the citizens of the USSR that was the major factor in the defeat of Hitler . The Soviet Union lost 30 million people during the war ( One in six of its citizens ) and just as many died through Stalin as through Hitler , something that is not forgotten by this film.All in all a good film but one that is inferior to CROSS OF IRON a film that I absolutely adore and consider to be the best film to feature the second world war as its backdrop",7.0,Anonymous,History
Tense war drama that centers the viewer in the German invasion of Stalingrad,"I simply want to weigh in with a very positive response to Enemy at the Gates. Taken as a historical drama rather than an attempt to flawlessly depict an historical incident, this is topnotch entertainment. ""Enemy"" portrays the conflict between a young Russian sniper played by Law and the German sniper (Harris) who is sent to kill him during the German attack on Stalingrad during WWII. Apart from a scene which awkwardly caricatures the Russian field commanders and the occasionally distracting accents, the film successfully immerses the viewer in this tense war drama. Appreciate it it for its tight focus, uncompromising realism, and fine characterizations by the main actors. Research the historical accuracy later, if you must, but don't let it spoil the film.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"The futility of war, and what causes it.","I really loved this film.  It is one of the best movies about war - what it is like, and what causes it.  I know some people find the love story hard to take, but it is there to illustrate how jealousy and envy can lead to irrational acts, hate, and even war.At a time when the world is racing toward armed conflict yet again, this film is a timely reminder of the ultimate futility of war.  The opening sequence is one of the most horrific I have ever seen - comparable to that incredible opening scene in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.  But unlike ""Ryan"", this film does not become a flag-waving one-sided analysis of war.  Instead we get an in depth, and very moving, look at the reality of being human in a war situation - whether male or female, German or Russian.  And Jude Law, Joseph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz and Ed Harris all give superb performances.  I was a bit hard-pressed, though, to believe Bob Hoskins as Krushchev.Jean-Jacques Annaud is a remarkable director, with a strong visual style, and deserves to be recognised as one of the contemporary masters of cinema.

Tried to be too much.,"This wasn't a bad movie.  I enjoyed much of it.  I thought it captured some of war's grit and horror and the performances by Jude Law and Ed Harris were good.  Bob Hoskins was great.  I thought Rachel Weisz was also good but the rather sappy love story placed inside of this movie slowed the action and disrupted the flow.  The story for me was about the duel between the two snipers.  The love interest could have been introduced and used as in a minor way, such as giving Vassili a reason to want to live, but it took up too much of the screen time thus confusing the main point of the movie.  Was it a war movie or a love story?  It tried to be both and failed to gel into a whole movie.  Still it was worth watching.  War movie fans will have to suffer through the sap while love story fans have to endure the gore.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Hugely efficient war movie, with thorough authenticity","This effective movie has a great, epic background over which to play the story - the battle of Stalingrad in World War II, which left the city in smouldering ruins and hundreds of soldiers (on both sides) dead. Like with most modern blockbusters, the budget is big (the biggest in Europe, it has been said), and there are plenty of authentic bombing raids and gun battles in this action-packed movie which only slightly drags towards the end. CGI fighters spit bombs down on to the ruined streets and the smoke from dozens of explosions fills the sky to great effect in some truly breath-taking battle sequences. The film doesn't shy away from the violence either, preferring to show in graphic detail the sight of bullets erupting through bodies and exploding heads, blood everywhere, particularly in a disturbingly realistic scene showing enemy fire peppering a group of soldiers huddled together on a boat.Over this intense background plays a story that is in parts a thriller, a tragedy, and a romance. The various plot strands are mingled perfectly to make one smooth-running film as a whole with well-drawn characters you can really care about. In particular, Jude Law gives a convincing portrayal of an innocent farmer boy, initially terrified out of his life when he is thrown headlong into battle, and gradually turning into a war hero through the propaganda of his friend Danilov (an understated and effective turn from Joseph Fiennes).The initial sequence in which Law proves his worth as a sniper is an excellently-shot piece of action. Into the story comes Rachel Weisz, as the love interest, a female Russian soldier, and there's even a love triangle thrown in there too for good measure between her, Law and Fiennes. However, most scenes are stolen by Ed Harris (looking very much like Anton Diffring) as Major Konig, a German war hero and top-notch sniper who engages in some tense and suspenseful cat-and-mouse games in the rubble of Stalingrad, sequences which are the best in the movie. Good support comes from a near-unrecognisable Bob Hoskins as Khrushchev, and Ron Perlman as a fellow sniper with a mouth full of metal teeth.ENEMY AT THE GATES is a well-made and intelligent blockbuster, convincingly portraying the realism of the war, peppered with many memorable scenes such as the macabre image of a young boy hanging from ruins on the horizon. Although the outcome is to be expected, the journey there is an eventful and often surprising one and never less than watchable. A shame that all modern blockbusters aren't often as intelligently scripted or acted as this film is.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Come for the Action, Not Historical Accuracy","Upon my first viewing of this film after many years as an older adult, all I could do in the opening scenes was marvel at the way the French writer-directors demonise the Soviet higher-ups by making them into cold-blooded killers of their own men.I had forgotten how historically inaccurate this film was, in that respect.I'm not saying that it was nice being in the Soviet army at this point, but the Russians wouldn't have been a key element to Allied victory if they'd treated their soldiers as badly as they are depicted here. Heck, I'm the first 15 minutes, it looks like it's a lot better to be a German soldier.So, if you can put the aside that aspect of the film and accept that you're getting a very biased view of the protagonists of this film, then you can probably stomach the rest of it.Because the truth of the this film is simple. It's one for effect.Everything from the love at first sight meeting of the lady to the battle scenes to the overly dramatic score, it's all about evoking emotion first and historical accuracy much, much later.Once you accept that, you're good to go. And maybe you'll be able to stop yourself chuckling at the glaring falsified aspects of the Soviets.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Should be taught in film class.,"Imagine the pitch:A game of cat-and-mouse = great! A game of cat-and-mouse between two snipers = even better! Make it a true story = whoa! Make it a war story = WHOA! Shoot it on rarely seen actual locations = hubba hubba! Cast it with an international A-list = excellent! Include perennial Academy-Award nominee Ed Harris = superb! Make the antagonist a Nazi = should be no problem for an audience to want to see HIS comeuppance!And now ... make the protagonists a Communist sniper and a Communist propaganda officer (Law and Fiennes, respectively)!This is exactly the task that director Jean-Jacques Annaud faced with ENEMY AT THE GATES.  How does one make a movie where the GOOD guys work for Stalin, one of the most hideous human beings ever to walk the earth?Answer:  Start with the script.  By making the decision to give Mr. Fiennes and Mr. Law's characters dimensionality through love and friendships, the script is creating characters the audience can relate to.  By the simple act of withholding the same information about Mr. Harris' Nazi, the script makes him a more dangerous antagonist who is already cold hearted and cunning (he uses a child to his advantage in a much more effective way than your standard movie villain).  Throw in a woman who is unwilling to sit on the sidelines as war threatens to determine her fate (Weisz), and you have four compelling characters to lead your story.Next comes casting.  Casting an actor that the audience inherently has come to trust over the years - Ed Harris - as a Nazi sniper antagonist, adds dimension to the film.  All of a sudden, the audience is asked to take sides, not merely shoved one way or the other.Next comes the setting.  By choosing to set the film in a place that is cold, unforgiving, and unrelenting on its best days (not to mention war) adds necessary tension and desperation.  Then throw in utterly graphic and realistic war violence.  Take all this and wrap it around a true story and you have a combination that should make an audience's stomach tie itself in to knots.Finally, hire a director.  Who better for this hard-to-sell story than a man who has made a career out of untellable stories such as THE BEAR and QUEST FOR FIRE?Finally, then ... an undeservingly overlooked film that is certainly better than most everything else on the shelves of your local video store.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Well executed war film with an insane flaw.,"Enemy at the Gates is a war movie full of suspense and grittiness.Ed Harris really nails his role as a German master sniper. He steals every scene he is in.The cat and mouse game with the Russian and German sniper is depicted really well.But there is a glaring flaw that is so utterly obvious it broke my immersion and feeling of suspense massively.Stalingrad was a city litterally crawling with hundreds of thousands of German and Russian soldiers.Every house, every room and every little crack in a wall was guarded by soldiers along the front line in the city.But the film makers dedicate whole streets and house blocks to the fight of two snipers. They don't do this all the time but it's a massive and gross mistake nonetheless.Hollywood often treats its audiences like they are stupid and sadly this film is no exception.This ruins an otherwise brilliant film for me.",6.0,Anonymous,History
The best war movie I've ever watched!,"All future war films that I watch will be forced through the sieve of Enemy at the Gates and I will be surprised if anything from America will even remotely touch the power of this film.I freely admit that I know nothing about the production except that it could not possibly have been made with American money-too many foreigners acting, too few swipes at the Russians and far too many positive comments about the hated Soviets.The opening war shots of the barges across the river ferrying fresh troops to the besieged Stalingrad was as harrowing as any war sequence that I've ever seen and to think that the reality of the Stalingrad meat grinder was vastly worse gives you chills-the landing on the shore with its inevitable battles shows reasons for the revolvers that officers carry.The second, but major section of the script, with the development of the mini-war between the German sent to Stallingrad to kill the now famous young Russian sniper provides as good a background for the remainder of the film as is possible to see in a cinema.  The drama of the characters trying to play out some semblance of reality against the horrors of Stalingrad would tax the best of the best and the entire cast and crew deserve the highest accolades for their success in bringing this amazing story to the cinema.If you, as I did, miss this movie in the theatre then make every effort to rent it on video-it is brilliant!",10.0,Anonymous,History
The bloody battle of Stalingrado between two nations became a conflict between two men well played by Jude Law and Ed Harris,"The film is a love story and death set in 1942-1943 during the Battle of Stalingrad, into the six month battle that caused nearly 2,000,000 total casualties (wounded, killed, captured) for the two opponents, including hundreds of thousands of Russian civilians. Nikita Khrushchev (Bob Hoskins) arrives in Stalingrad to coordinate defense of the city and demands ideas from his subordinates on how to improve morale. Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) , a senior lieutenant, suggests that the people need ""an example, but an example to follow"" and give them hope.Danilov recommends Zaitzev. Soon after, Danilov begins publishing tales of Vasily's exploits in the army's newspaper that paint him as a national hero and propaganda icon. Vasily (Jude Law) is transferred to the sniper division and becomes friends with Danilov.

The story follows soldiers from both sides as they fight to survive while saving the lives of their loves, and struggle with retaining their humanity in the face of certain death and the unspeakable horrors of war. It displays a good cast giving nice interpretations , including Jude Law as Zaytsev, Rachel Weisz as Tania Chernova, and Ed Harris as König, with Joseph Fiennes, Bob Hoskins, Ron Perlman, Eva Mattes, Gabriel Marshall Thomson, and Matthias Habich .The screenwriter studied diaries of the participants of the Battle of Stalingrad and also used museum archives, documents and recorded stories of its participants. It contains a rousing and evocative musical score by James Horner . It packs a colorful and adequate cinematograhy by Robert Fraisse whose shooting took place in Germany and the crossing of the Volga River was done on the Altdöberner See, a man-made lake near the village of Pritzen, in the south of Brandenburg. A derelict factory in the village of Rüdersdorf was used to recreate the ruins of Stalingrad's tractor factory. The massive outdoor set of Stalingrad's Red Square was built at Krampnitz, near Potsdam. The film was well directed, co-written and produced by Jean-Jacques Annaud, based on William Craig's 1973 non-fiction book Enemy at the Gates: The Battle for Stalingrad.The magnificent filmmaker Annaud creates yet another picture excellently directed and stunningly produced . Annaud directed particular films with almost no human dialogue such as ¨Quest for fire¨ and was an expert on animal movies as proved in ¨The bear¨ , ¨Running Free¨ about horses and ¨Two brothers¨ dealing with tigers . His most successful pictures were ¨The lover¨ , ¨Enemy of the gates¨,¨Seven years in Tibet¨ and of course ¨The name of the rose¨.Other films about this battle are as follows : Stalingrad: Dogs, Do You Want to Live Forever? a 1959 West German film, directed by Frank Wisbar with Joachim Hansen as Wisse , Wilhelm Borchert as Friedrich Paulus , Wolfgang Preiss as Linkmann , Carl Lange as General von Seydlitz , Horst Frank as Feldwebel Böse , Peter Carsten as Obergefreiter and Sonja Ziemann .Stalingrad (1993) by Director Joseph Vilsmaier with Dominique Horwitz as Obergefreiter Fritz Reiser , Thomas Kretschmann as Leutnant Hans von Witzland , Jochen Nickel as Unteroffizier Manfred ""Rollo"" Rohleder , Sebastian Rudolph .Stalingrad (2013) with Pyotr Fyodorov as Capt.

Sniper Warfare at its finest,"An exercise in the brutality within the bloody ruins of Stalingrad, Enemy at the Gates is a taut and highly atmospheric game of cat and mouse between Major König and legendary sniper, Vasily Zaitsev. Gripping from the get-go with its barbaric depiction of its opposing armies coming to blows, with not one step back, Director Jean-Jacques Annaud delivers a film that simultaneously has you squirming in your seat and right on the edge. The handheld and sweeping camera motions only help to heighten the sense of fear and scale Stalingrad itself possess, with James Horner's hauntingly unnerving and beautiful score to compliment it. All this with the addition of a great cast consisting of Jude Law, Ed Harris, Bob Hoskins and a criminally underused Ron Perlman, Enemy at the Gates is a top-notch depiction of sniper warfare and the power of propaganda. You just have to forgive a few historical inaccuracies, British-speaking Soviets, American-speaking Nazis and the pointless addition of a Hollywood love triangle that really drag the picture down.",8.0,Anonymous,History

"ENEMA AT THE DOOR:  an Foreigner Will Not Notice, a Russian Will Not Forgive","I got to see the widely publicized in the West movie ""Enemy at the Gates"", directed by Jean Jaques Annaud. After ""Saving Private Ryan"", which had left an overall good impression, I hoped that this Hollywood product would turn out to be on the same level. But contrary to my expectations... Well, let's start from the beginning.From the first moments I was struck by the rosy, well-fed faces of the Russian soldiers going to the front. Of course, I understand that life in the West is nice and sweet, but where were the makeup artists? All Soviet soldiers wore brand new greatcoats. Throughout the entire movie I only saw well-fed, not to say fat, faces, and even Danilov's three day stubble (incidentally, why does he walk around unshaven in the army?) badly masks his well-groomed face. I think the director never even considered the fact that life on the Soviet home front in 1942 wasn't sweet, McDonalds restaurants just weren't there, and sausages didn't get buttered. I was also amused about how people riding inside the freight rail cars were standing. I think the director has never even tried to imagine how it felt to ride in such a car, how it shakes you from side to side, and far from anyone would manage to stay on his feet.Meanwhile, the train arrives at some station, all the civilians are unloaded, soldiers are herded inside, and... some men started locking the cars! That's right! It turns out that Soviet soldiers had to be padlocked. Why? I don't know. Probably, the director believes that our grandfathers fought only from fear, that if it was up to them, they would've ran away, and nobody would've been left to fight the valiant German army.Meantime, the train arrives at the Stalingrad station, the padlocks are unlocked, and evil officers start dragging the soldiers out of the cars! And another political officer stands nearby (probably, the chief one, and a big boss above the other political officers), waves a red flag, and yells into a tin megaphone. I don't know how our Western comrades see this picture, but it sent me into a spasm of laughter. I haven't seen such a silly scene even in the comedy series ""Fitil'"" (Fuse). But speaking seriously, this is already an insult, and it's more serious than it could seem in the beginning. Russian soldiers are shown as dumb cattle, led by the evil devils-political officers. And incidentally, political officers were different. Sh*t can occur anywhere, not just among the political officers, that's why depicting them in such perverted manner looks extremely insulting. And that is exactly how they are depicted! I specifically made several screen shots so that you could see that people with the most disgusting faces were selected for the roles of political officers. I don't know, why Jaques Annaud feels personally slighted by the political officers, maybe they stole his money or a cow, but his bitter hatred for our grandfathers literally oozes from the screen!The scene where the soldiers were unloaded from the train reminded me of a mass escape from a psychiatric hospital, but not the Red Army. I don't know, perhaps the US Army troops unload in just such a manner?The scene of an attack. I was simply shocked by the fact that the attack began at the whistle of a mad officer! Who proposed this nonsense to the director? Or did he think really hard, and then couldn't come up with anything better? Probably it's what they call ""artistic license"". The attack itself follows the best traditions of the Western idea of how could the Russians attack. In other words - complete rubbish. Soldiers simply run as fast as they can at the machine guns, like a herd of cattle! Machine guns fire long bursts at them. This insulting stupidity, under the name of ""Human Waves"", was invented in the West during the times of the Cold War, and Jaques Annaud simply faithfully portrayed that fairy tale on the big screen.",1.0,Anonymous,History
"Uh, guys, there's a war on","No doubt the title is an indication of what the film would LIKE to be about. The Germans forces were indeed ""at the gates"" - they are on the verge of capturing Stalingrad, they would lay siege to Leningrad, and at one point even Moscow appeared to be in danger.  The situation was desperate.  But after we're told all this, the position of the German army turns out to have no more to do with the story than the position of the sun in the zodiac. After a bitter, violent battle over - well, we're never told - nothing of a military nature happens again.  Not even offstage.  (Until the end, when, after a brief ""offensive"" of unfathomable significance, an epilogue tells us that the Germans were repelled from after all.)  All the action in Stalingrad freezes so that we can watch a protracted duel between a Russian and a German sniper.Now I'm prepared to believe that snipers played a valuable role in this kind of warfare - I wouldn't know - but Vassili's primary value, we must assume in the absence of information to the contrary, is as propaganda - a means of keeping up the morale of the local troops.  But there's something circular here.  The snipers are the only people we see doing any actual fighting, and by the end of the film they seem to be devoting all their efforts to shooting a German sniper who is in turn doing nothing but trying to shoot Vassili.  What does ANY of this have to do with, you know, the invasion?The fact that the troops of a hostile foreign power are on Russian soil (they haven't yet been defeated, and it looks to be only a matter of time before even Moscow would be overrun) doesn't seem to motivate the characters to do much.  Nobody makes a single decision for the good of the war effort as a whole.  Danilov builds up the Vassili legend because of personal feelings and is ready to tear it down later for other personal reasons; Tania wants to kill Germans - kill them herself, by hand, rather than help her fellow soldiers as best she can by working in intelligence - because they killed her parents; Danilov tries to transfer her to a safer job not because that's where she should be (it's a mere coincidence that that IS where she should be), but because he's hitting on to her; Vassili's heart isn't in the duel with the German sniper until he has a casual acquaintance's death to avenge.  When Sacha's mother is told that her son is a traitor (now serving the forces who have bombed the city she grew up in to rubble), her only reaction is, ""Perhaps he'll be safer with them than with us.""  Wherever we look, we see dreary personal concerns.  Did any of these people notice that the enemy IS at the gates?If Anaud was trying to make his characters more plausible by making them pettier, he failed.  When Sacha tells a third party what we supposedly already know - that Tania is in love with Vassili - it came as news to me. I hadn't seen any insipient love anywhere.  I suppose I ought to have worked it out, by assuming that the single female character must be there to fall in love with someone and using a process of elimination to work out who it was (she plainly didn't care for one of the two candidates, therefore she must be head over heels with the other one), but really, even in a movie as dull as this, I have better things to do.",,Anonymous,History

Those scenes made the movie for me! It's pretty neat that it's based on a true story too!

One of the best movie experiences of my life,"Already from the promos, one could see how different, unique and original this movie is among the usual ""goo"" coming out of Hollywood in the last few years. There is much to be said on this movie. But briefly - it is a wondrous experience, with a superb movie making skills - from the captivating screenplay and direction of Jean-Jacques Annaud to the memorable acting of Jude Law, Joseph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz. Jude Law conveys a truly one of a kind hero/Human character, and manages to color every scene with the most extreme emotions - from fear to desire, from love to hatred. Joseph Fiennes, who already proved his acting skills in ""Shakespeare in love"", pours the content of the the script into action. Ed Harris, who already proved to be true to his acting and not to his ""Hollywood standards"", makes one doubt the villain/human conflict as one finds it more than difficult to despise this character. The movie has some unforgettable scenes. From the very beginning the movie brings us into the war from the perspective of the soldiers, who were literally thrown in and are stunned by the sights as we are. One of the most admirable features of this film is how non presumptuous it is. The film deals with sensitive issues like the Communism ideology in an authentic matter. It depicts the Russians in a human way, and criticizes the Communism idea, not per se, but its ""mutation"" to Stalin's Soviet Union. Several scenes in the movie are truly magnificent, from the entrance of Nikita Krushchev, played by talented Bob Hoskins, to one of the best scenes in Film history - the love making of Vassili and Tanya. This scene can in itself characterize how different this film is from the rest of Hollywood films. In impossible environment and without actually showing anything, Annaud manages to convey passion, love and desire among the opposite feelings of probably the worst period in Human history. I can only hope that this movie will deserve its respect among next year's Oscars, as even though it is such a dark film taking place in WWII, it is truly a colorful film which conveys emotions in an authentic way - love, revenge, regret, envy, passion and hatred. If you love cinema or not, if you prefer war movies, if you prefer romantic movies... if you are human - go see this movie. You won't regret it!",10.0,Anonymous,History

NOT a classic,"This is a reasonable movie, worth watching once, but by no means the masterpiece that some here have described it as. Visually, the recreation of Stalingrad is impressive. The battle scenes are well executed, but lack the impact and realism of Private Ryan. It is the overly romantic script and wooden acting by Jude Law and the smaller supporting roles that really let this movie down. Vassili's cheerful attitude after a good days shooting really negates any gritty realism that may have been achieved on the battle field. Ed Harris's Major König is a far more believable character.As a WWII epic this pales in comparison to Private Ryan, Thin Red Line and Band of Brothers. The sniper scenes are poorly done when compared with `Sniper' starring Tom Berenger.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Often overlooked WW2 film,"Enemy at the Gates with a strong cast of Joseph Fiennes, Jude Law, Rachel Weisz, Bob Hoskins and Ed Harris was released in 2001 after a resurgence in interest in war movies following the success of 'Saving Private Ryan'. Filmed with a similar budget, 'Enemy at the Gates' was though nowhere near as successful upon its release.This is not a bad movie, the story of the competing snipers of the two sides battling it out while the bigger events of the Battle for Stalingrad wages destructively around them, is compelling. Obviously the cast is strong, though none giving career high performances, no one really stands out.It is hard to pinpoint why it is not better. The opening scenes of the destruction and barbarity of war, though not matching those of Saving Private Ryan are still powerful and well shot. The movie lags a bit in the mid section and the tone seems slightly off with the characters not really acknowledging or portraying the awfulness or futility of what is going on around them. Also the topic of the accents has to be mentioned. Yes, all the actors not attempting to speak English in a Russian accent is maybe commendable, but then you get everyone speaking in bland 'Middle English' accents which is more distracting even. Jude Law being the worst offender.Good but not great WW2 movie, still well worth a watch for the underlying sniper story alone.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Who's Worse.  Hitler or Stalin?,"This is about the most awful results of war. There could be no more gut level fighting than that which took place between the Russians and the Nazis. This film is quite striking just for its war scenes. The Russians have so much resolve and they truly wore down the German machine. I'm sure that given a place at the Russian front terrified most German soldiers. Krueschev comes off ass despicable. Like most in authority, he is fine with sending wave after wave to be cannon fodder and then spends his time intimidating those who haven't' made that sacrifice. The boss, Stalin's, presence is in every scene. Jude Law's sniper is just a cog. Heroism really counts for nothing. The only result is getting the German's out of Stalingrad and turning the tide. Imagine the dehumanizing of this man. It makes the point again what a waste of lives, property, and human spirit war is. It sets back humanity every time.",8.0,Anonymous,History

I took the road lessed traveled and actually liked this movie,"Unlike the abundance of people who've commented on this movie, I loved it. Yes, it did have historical inaccuracies but what movie doesn't?  It's called HISTORICAL FICTION not a historical documentary.  The movie was very entertaining.  From the beginning, I was sucked into the plot and seemed to feel every emotion every character was feeling.  Joseph Fiennes once again does a great job in playing a very complicated, confused character.  I thought Jude Law did an excellent job playing Vassili especially since he's usually seen portraying spoiled little rich boys.  It was a great move for him by expanding his horizons and not being a one-role man (such as Michael Douglas or Richard Gere).  I loved being able to see a different aspect in the war.  It was cool being able to see a war movie without America being involved in it at all.  It was also interesting to see Russia's war tactics at the beginning of the movie and how'd they kill their own men if they retreated at all.  Working fear into fear i guess.  I also liked looking through the eyes of a sniper in WWII.  Seeing how they work was very interesting to me.  Once again, this movie made me realize how stupid and unnecessary war is in the world.  Yes, I must admit, it's entertaining with the gore and special effects, but in real life it's ten times worse than in the movies and they're REAL people being killed.  I liked how they added in Bob Hoskins (one of the most underrated actors of all time) into the cast. He added a little comedic relief and it was a pleasure to see him again. Anyways, I fell in love with this movie from the getgo and although most of the commentators hate this movie, it's still rated high (7.5 out of 10) on the users' rating which means most of the people liked it anyway so I'm not alone I guess.  I've been recommending this to all my family friends and will continue to see all the movies made with Law and Fiennes in them since they are the biggest up and coming actors of our time and it's fun to see them grow in experience.  So overall I liked this movie although the love scene could have been omitted but the love triangle furthered the plot and made it more interesting to me. 9 out of 10 *'s",10.0,Anonymous,History

Americans crack me up.,"I love hearing comments about things the average American knows next to nothing about.A) The movie was loosely based on a short segment of the novel ""Enemy at the Gates"" (which referred to the Wermacht approaching the city) by William Craig, in which the duel between Vaili Zaitsev and the German Uber sniper is played out in the course of a page and a half.B) The truly epic proportions and consequences of The Battle for Stalingrad are under-appreciated by most non-Europeans. At one point, the Wermacht had the Red army backed up to the Volga in a stretch of land a mere 100 meters wide and less than a mile long. Had the Wermacht been able to drive the Russians from their beach head (the boat landing)and into the river, that would have been it. The Volga had always been the final objective of Hitler's war machine in the East. When Bob Hoskins said ""If this city falls the whole country will collapse"", he was not exaggerating. Therefore, due to the 'heroic' example of Vasili Zaitsez, which agruably could have been an inspiriation point for the embattled Soviets and their Red army, it could have caused them to take pride in their country and Army and defeat the battle-hardened 6th army (the line between fact and Party propaganda has always been blurry, so it is possible Vasili Zaitsev could have never existed). If the Red army had not launched Operation Uranus, which slashed through the less-than-reliable German allies guarding the city's flanks (the Italins, Rumanians and other axis lesser powers) and cut off the the 6th, Stalingrad would have fallen and at that point, the Wermacht would have been able to regroup its forces and smash the Red army and we would be living in an entirely different world. Until the fall of Communism, the exact death count in Stalingrad was a forbiden subject and it has since been estimated to be over a million KIA russians. The average survival time for a fresh Russian private in Stalingrad was less than 24 hours.C) In response to the statement that the scope of the Battle for Stalingrad was not evident in the movie, you have to consider that by the time Zaitsev had been elevated to master sniper, the worst of the battle had already occured and it had devolved into small-unit level street fighting. The prescence of snipers on both sides was a constant concern and your life could have been snuffed out in an instant. The scope of the battle was constantly demonstrated throughout the movie by the level of devestation inflicted on the once beautiful and modern city. Keep in mind that prior to the 6th army's advance INTO the city, it had undergone the largest artillery and air bombardment of the war to date.C) I want Americans to understand 1 thing. In WW2, the approximate loss of American fightng men was 500,000. A half a million. Sounds like alot. About the population of a medium sized US city(Mesa, Arizona boasts a population of 330,000 in season). On the Russian side, losses numbered closer to 16,000,000 civilian and military. Think about that. For every GI, marine, airman or sailor the US lost in WW2, the soviets lost approximatley 32 men, women, or children. 16 million, thats about the combined total of both NYC and LA. Incredible, huh?? Also, the Red army, which came back from what would be intolerable losses to Americans, at the outset of the war, was able to turn its fortunes around and push  the finest army of it's day from the Volga to Berlin...back over 1,000 miles!!! So, next time an American says ""We won the war"" think to yourself that all we did was take enough heat off the russians to help THEM win the war. Chew on that.D) The love triangle portrayed between Zaitsev and Tatiyana was an obvious attempt to draw women into the theatre. However, it is a well known fact that women fought in the Red Army alongside their male counter-parts and ANYWHERE you put men and women into extraordinary situations such as this, love/sex/romance is gonna happenOverall, I felt that Enemy at the Gates was an excellent movie despite its oversights in editing, (on more than one occasion the same 'extra' was seen falling from the same wound). I also belive that it would have been more appropriatley entitled ""War of the Rats"" (Rattenkrieg in german)a novel released in '99 (or '97 not sure) which was exclusively about the sniper duel in question. I went to see this movie expecting an epic story about Stalingrad. Initially, I was disapointed to see a movie about a small number of people in the most epic battle in modern history. However, upon buying the VHS and watching it again, I appreciated the movie for what it was. An excellent story of an epic struggle between 2 marksman.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Enemy at the gates is an entertaining edge of the seat adventure that never gets boring.  Go to the cinema to enjoy yourself in an exciting action packed movie.  However don't expect a history lesson.  Despite its grand scale battles the movie is very inaccurate. Excluding the fact that annoyingly all the actors have either American or British accents there are many other goofs such as the fact that the Russian soldiers sing the Soviet anthem...when that had been written until AFTER the Second World War.  You would think that with so much money spent on this movie the producers would have realized such a gaping error! The amateur script also lets down the experience a tad...with Jude Law limited to some really terrible lines which sound even worse with his very British accent. Nevertheless despite these cons there are enough pros in the movie to make this a damn fine flick! Ed Harris is superb as the Nazi sniper sent into kill Law, Rachel Weisz is stunning as the love interest, the music (although rejects from Apollo 13) is very moving and the action scenes are superbly recreated.

Stalingrad action pic only,"Not a bad war film - but only if you know nothing about the actual battle. The film makers are entitled to take artistic license, and although some historical characters are present in the film, it never even comes close to portraying the battle as it was. Much of the fighting lacks reality and the computer generated Stuka dive bombers attacking reinforcements crossing the Volga are totally unrealistic.The film takes a quick peek at several themes of the actual battle but explores none - including the character of Zaitsev himself, whose role in the battle was quite different from Law's character. It is worth mentioning that several other Russian snipers, in Stalingrad and elsewhere, killed many more Germans than Zaitsev.

Fascinating biopic of an actual person,"(2001) Enemy At The Gates
BIO- WAR DRAMACo-produced, co-written and directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud with the war scenes are somewhat inspired by ""Saving Private Ryan"" because of the realism but with one small difference, is that this story is based on an actual sharp shooter who used to be a soldier under Stalin rule. Starring Jude Law as Vassili Zaitsev championed as a hero and used as an inspiration for sharp shooting many Nazi invaders. This film chronicles Vassili Zaitsev's life very well from the time he was young and to the time he was automatically drafted into the Russian army. Joseph Fiennes also co-stars as Commisar Danilov a Russian press who's job is to encourage other people to rise up against the Nazis but happens to fall in love with the same nurse, Tania (Rachael Weiss). And Ed Harris was also memorable as one of Nazis best sharp shooters, pitting him against Zaitsev. Footnote: A friend of mine who I consider to be a war historian was very intrigued by this person and did some further checking on him since the film didn't really provide any of his future existence in terms of whether he's still living or not, and he informed me that as a result of the recognition Vassili Zaitsev was receiving after WWII, Stalin's officials sent him away to another country which I think he was sent to Siberia.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Story of war, love, sacrifice - delicately balanced, delivers explosively","Most of the reviews I've read for this movie refer to the misplaced love story that dilutes the otherwise strong plot and minimalizes the omnipresent tragedy and horror that is war.Quite honestly, I feel that the love story is what truly solidified this film and took it from the ranks of the great war movies to the category of great cinema.The film is technically engrossing, and dramatically enthralling. All of the performances are solid and emotionally involving.This is definitely the finest movie I've seen this year.The sniper battles were very well portrayed and suspenseful.  The love triangle, though seemingly out of place, was quite realistic, and added a new element to an already fascinating story.  Both sides of the larger battle were portrayed fairly and for the most part accurately (as opposed to, say, Saving Private Ryan).  The film succeeded in all the ways a wonderful film should, in my opinion.I simply cannot say how much I love this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The only thing that can stop a good guy with a gun...,"If you'd heard that a movie from back in 2001 starred Jude Law, Rachel Weisz and Joseph Fiennes, you might think it was about a throuple of merchant bankers running wild in Tony Blair's London. But add Ed Harris, Bob Hoskins and especially Ron Perlman, and you've got the kind of movie the Hollywood Ten were turning out for the studios after the Hitler-Stalin Pact went kaputt in 1941. The opening scene--a Bizarro World version of the D-Day landing in ""Private Ryan""--really gets your attention: fresh troops are ferried across the Volga, issued rifles (one for every two men in expectation of horrendous casualties) and herded toward the German lines by pistol-packin' commissars. Anyone who wavers or retreats is gunned down by better equipped NKVD men... (Seat-of-the-pants fact check: I've read about such things happening on the Russian Front, but this version may be a little OTT.)JL plays Vassili Zaitsev, a legendary sharpshooter and a real-life Hero of the Soviet Union, JF's the Party propagandist who turns him into the poster boy for dead-shot Russian marksmanship*, RW's the German-lit major who spends her days and nights typing up field-telephone intercepts but yearns to get back to the action. Both men are attracted to her, of course, but only Vassily gets to spoon with her in a bunker full of snoring comrades (a surprisingly sexy scene). Ed Harris is the (fictional) German sniper, Major König, who stalks Vassili through an urban hellscape reminiscent of the sets for The Last of Us... hold the fungus. (The names ""Vassili"" and ""König"" derive from the resp. Greek and German words for ""king,"" FWIW.)TL;dr: What my bro and I used to call ""the love stuff,"" the perfunctory flashback-origin story and the rear-echelon intrigue are predictable but watchable enough; the sharpshooters' duel--pitched by Joseph Fiennes's propaganda as ""the Bavarian nobleman who hunts wild boars"" vs. ""the shepherd boy from the Urals,"" a textbook example of class struggle--is genuinely suspenseful. ""Enemy at the Gates"" turns up on cable from time to time. If you like this sort of thing, why not give it a look?* Disappointing that a reviewer of the original release beat me to the obligatory ""Marxmanship"" joke by 20+ years.",8.0,Anonymous,History
American & Brit actors play Soviets & Germans. Duh!,"Excellent production talent provides a gritty war-torn backdrop reminiscent of ""Saving Private Ryan"" for this weak story and poor historical account of the Battle for Stalingrad, a pivotal fight in the WWII European theater. The film tells of a Soviet war hero and sniper (Law) who squares off against a dogged adversary and top German sniper (Harris) providing the suspense and intrigue. The love story is played out like a clumsy after-thought and the use of big name stars for box office bucks when many good European actors could have added realism to the film was a typically self-serving Hollywood decision. Hoskins playing Khrushchev with his limey accent was laughable not to mention Harris as a German or Law as a Soviet and no attempt to fake an accent by anyone. A typical could-have-been-better flick which will entertain the masses and make the money mongers of filmdom happy while movie purists grumble.",7.0,Anonymous,History
All Quite on the Russian Front,"It's 1942, and the Russians are brutalized by the Nazi Army at Stalingrad. Still, the Russian resisters proclaim, ""Never will the enemy put his foot on the soil of Stalingrad!"" Sharp-shooting soldier Jude Law (as Vassili Zaitsev) meets, and bonds with, commissar comrade Joseph Fiennes (as Danilov). Mr. Fiennes, who survives massacre by playing possum, is very impressed with Mr. Law's sniper fire. Law had been firing between the eyes since his days as a shepherd boy. After losing several Germans to Law's bullets, the Nazis send their own Major sharpshooter, Ed Harris (as König), out to bag Law. Meanwhile, Law and Fiennes form the obligatory ""love triangle"" with fetching Rachel Weisz (as Tania).Jean-Jacques Annaud directs big production values well enough, and the story's setting is a refreshing change from the usual western-fronted World War II epics. But, the whole thing collapses under its unnecessary, and startlingly ordinary ""love triangle"". Law and Ms. Weisz are the main lovey-dovey duo. Their love-making scene may remind you about... well, not waking up the roommate. Duplicitous chocolate-loving young Gabriel Thomson (as Sasha) and Mr. Harris portray somewhat more interesting supporting characters.****** Enemy at the Gates (2001) ~ Jude Law, Joseph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz",6.0,Anonymous,History
I Like Watching Nazis Die,"The opening scenes of this movie, that depict a peasant boy being taught to kill wolves, intercut with a scene of Soviet soldiers being mowed down by Nazi automatic fire, were very hard for this viewer to watch.I'm not inured to cinematic violence. I wanted to give up on this movie for that reason. But, I had other reasons for watching it, so I continued.The violence is very well crafted. I felt as if I were watching real men being mowed down by real Nazis. I cried.The speeches commanders were giving their men -- reading letters from Russian mothers adjuring their boys to sacrifice for the motherland; informing men that deserters would be shot; the command, ""The one who has the rifle shoots. The one who doesn't have the rifle follows him. When the one with the rifle gets shot, the one without the rifle, takes the rifle, and shoots,"" are movie lines I don't think I'll soon forget.The performances are brilliant. Everyone, except, maybe, Bob Hoskins, who is depicted as simply older than Krushchev was at this time -- other than that, though Hoskins is good -- but everyone else is superb.Rachel Weisz, without a touch of make-up, her eyebrows untweezed, is so beautiful, inside and out, you can see why two men are in love with her.Jude Law is convincing as a Russian peasant who grew up to be a WW II sniper. This guy really is so much more than a pretty face. I think if he were not so good looking his deftness as an actor would be much more widely commented upon.Joseph Fiennes brings great conviction, intelligence, craftiness and fire to his part as a Communist propagandist.""Minor"" roles are similarly knocked out of the park -- Eva Mattes as besieged housewife, Gebrial Marshall-Thomson as a little boy taking on the job of a very big man, Ron Perlman as a man who sees through Communism, Sophie Rois as a female sniper, add depth and texture.Ed Harris as Major Konig really hypnotized me here. It was like watching a cobra in human form.It's a good thing that a mainstream, big budget movie addressed the Soviet contribution to the war.It's also a good thing that this movie is not any more romantic than it needs to be about what Soviet Communism was really all about, behind the slogans. At one point, a key character delivers a speech that is one of the best deconstructions of communism that I've ever heard.I ask myself, ""Would I watch this again? Why or why not?"" I don't think I could ever watch this again -- it was just too hard, too unrelieved. Mud, death, corpses, killing. Yeah, that's war. Why the sensible among us don't like war.I have another reservation about this movie. As hard as the opening scene was to watch, I watched it twice, at least partly because I knew it would be capped off with Zaitsev (Jude Law) the Russian sniper, swiftly picking off a handful of Nazi soldiers.Again, I try to avoid violent entertainment, because I agree with research that shows that violent entertainment changes us in ways I'd rather not be changed.When a movie makes me want to watch men die, I am fearful of what that movie is doing to me.I did want to see those Nazis die. I enjoyed watching Zaitsev pick them off.Part of the message of this movie is: lone, righteous man with gun solves problems by shooting bullets into other men's heads.That gives me pause.PS: James Horner's score may sound familiar to you. In fact, he is using bits of Prokofiev's score for the film ""Alexander Nevsky."" Nevsky, of course, depicts medieval battles with the (Germanic) Teutonic Knights, and was meant to be analagous with the Soviet struggle with Nazism. So, Horner's score's quotes from Prokofiev brings those motifs full circle.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Best Described as an Insult. Used better as firewood.,"When my American friends told me about this Movie I thought I might enjoy it. After 5 minutes I did not know whether to be angry or disgusted. The battle of Stalingrad(Leningrad is modern St. Petersburg up north, Stalingrad is Volgograd in Russia's south) has never before been so knowingly destroyed and revised to demonize and smear the country that won the war in Europe, and helped to fight and defeat Japan before it attacked the US in 1938-39.My family, hometown, and countrymen have never been so insulted in their fight for survival.The movie better describes a WW1 situation on the Eastern Front, not WW2, the USSR had become the largest industrialized entity on the planet by 1941. Blockaded Leningrad managed to produce its own version of an SMG even though it was mostly cut off.Germany invaded on June 22nd 1941, not 1942 as some who saw the film think. They 1st lost at Moscow and were pushed back. Hitler intended to cut off the South from the North by taking the Volga, and capture the oil rich Caucasus.He failed in all objectives, and not just in Stalingrad.True up to October 1941 Germans only suffered 1/3 the casualties of the USSR, about 300,000 compared to 850,000(plus up to 1 million people taken prisoner for their ties to the Communist Party and Army), still the greatest loss of German life since WW1. At Moscow all the Axis Nations suffered a humiliating defeat that over 4 months caused 500,000 dead/wounded/captured on the Axis Allies.""Enemy at the Gates"" was not interested in history.I never knew General Chuikov committed suicide, I was under the impression he lead the 62nd Army to victory. And it was not the Bureaucrat, Khruschev, who took command of the Soviet Army, but Veteran General Giorgi Zhukov, who employed massed ARTILLERY and AIRCRAFT on enemy positions. Actual Frontal Assaults never took place in the city.It was not human waves that won the battle. But Assault Squads organized for best efficiency in House to House fighting.The Germans had company. At the end of the battle an Army Group(B) of some 6 different Armies of Germans, Italians, Romanians, Hungarians, and Bulgarians surrendered.If young Russians take this movie seriously, then it is true that the Russian Educational System has fallen behind. Considering the footage of WW2 and the documentaries of it on Russian TV.",1.0,Anonymous,History
"A joke, from both a historical and a cinematic points of view","First of all, I think it was a mistake for the screenwriters to pick and choose such a big event in the history of WWII, a turning point so to speak, only to have it placed as a background, to something so much less significant, a duel between two snipers. If one has never read anything historical or seen any chronological movies about battle of Stalingrad, or any other battle for that matter before seeing this movie, one might even wonder, how did Russians win the war at all? With one rifle per four hands? Against tanks? And aircraft? And heavy artillery? You know there's only so much even a drunken Russian can do with his ½ of a rifle. I see all these peoples' comments complaining that the main characters' accents were too British or too American and that that spoiled the true Russian Character, however the Hollywood makers portray that to be. But, being Russian myself, I saw nothing in the movie, at least on the Russian side, that resembled any truth to even how people spoke to each other, how they interacted with each other. They just didn't seem Russian to me, and it didn't matter what accents they used. These characters were biased cardboard characters, speaking cardboard character lines, and acting, well, cardboard-like. In the opening scenes of the movie they show a bunch of unarmed people thrown into battle only to be massacred by well armed Germans. That's a crock of sh*t, pardon my Russian. Basically by 1942, Hitler's army was fighting on two fronts, and it was very, very tired. Both sides were. Both sides were running out of people and supplies. Mostly, Battle of Stalingrad was a two-steps-forward-one-step-back kind of war. People charging and taking over some useless strategic point and then being thrown back, and then charging again. It was a battle to see who had a bigger stamina, because both sides were low in numbers. But it was also a battle involving tanks, artillery, and planes on BOTH sides. In the movie they omitted that, showing us diving Stukas, and yet surprisingly, no anti-aircraft guns firing at them, no Russian planes in the sky, just two soldiers armed with one rifle. Bullsh*t. No number of Vasiliy Zaycevs or Tatyana Whoevers would be able to stand off, and more even, reverse the tide of war against Germans, without having, basically an equally, if not better, equipped army at their side. If you look at the numbers, about 250,000 German and about 100,000 Russian soldiers lost their lives over Stalingrad. Well from the movie it might seem the opposite. Plus the whole mood of the movie. Russian soldiers, seemed no different from prisoners, defending Stalingrad only because of the muzzles pointed at their backs. But actually, believe it or not, many of these people were defending their motherland, their wives, daughters, sons, etc. and they were doing it not because they were to be shot otherwise, but because they loved their country and believed in its future.  True, there were special NKVD units that were ordered to fire on retreating soldiers. But there was no other way, at that point. If Stalingrad would've fallen, that would greatly demoralize an entire Red Army, and cause an even greater loss of life. But by no means were soldiers thrown into battle, half-armed into their certain death. That would just be pointless, even for ruthless Russian Generals. Plus when they showed Kruschev commanding the front, I fell off my seat laughing. I can go on and on, and this would be a never-ending story, except that I don't want it to be as boring and as never-ending as the script for Enemy at the gates. Advice for people who like a little reality in their movies, don't see it. It sucks. I try to picture Private Ryan done by the same director. It just wouldn't be Private Ryan, but some stupid unrealistic war flick, sort of like U-571.",,Anonymous,History
Ups and downs: Enemy at the Gates.,"""The job of a sniper is too wait for the right time, just because the sniper sees you and you don't, doesn't mean they will shoot.""Ups....
Never expected too see the coach from the movie ""Radio""(Ed Harris) to be an elite Nazi sniper, but he fits well as an bad guy. The tension behind some of the sniper fights scenes was very engaging. I really liked the music score, it does feel like something that you would listen to while being in a city that has been destroyed beyond belief, and being hunted down by a sniper. I know the movie is dramatized beyond belief, but you have to remember, the legendary Soviet sniper was a real guy.Downs....
Good lord do some part feel cliche.

"Very Surprised, Actually not really","I've always enjoyed this movie, perhaps I enjoyed it because I never took it too seriously, how often does a Hollywood movie accurately represent anything, almost never, that's how often. I say this after reading a number of reviews here that absolutely despise this film, now given the fact that I'm not Russian I can never relate to how Russian people feel about this film, but let's just get this out of the way now, war no matter who is involved is a terrible thing so honestly you could tell the story as accurately as you want but at the end of the day it's still war. All countries/Governments tell lies so let's stop acting like our Governments are better than one another's, that's the whole damn problem that creates WAR in the first place, Lies, Greed, and Pride which all nations are guilty of. The Russians who are so greatly offended by this movie answer me this, if a movie 30 years from now is made about Russia's invasion of Ukraine, will you be offended by the brutal honesty that will be depicted in such a film? As an American I'm ashamed of the things my country has done to others around the globe and I have no problem admitting that. Everyone should have pride for their country and nationality but we all should be mindful that, for the most part, there is no innocent nation, we all play a part in being inhumane, instead of being prideful of how accurate our war efforts are being portrayed perhaps we should all be striving towards understanding that we're all human beings because as a whole we're all failing miserably at being humane to one another. It's time to change the way we've been living because the old ways aren't working, there should be only one race, the human race, I'll be the first to admit that my country, America has done terrible things to other nations, people like to say ""typical Americans, they're all greedy and don't care about anyone but themselves"", we'll I resent that because I care about all people, and for all people to have freedom and opportunities, no matter your race, country, gender, or religion. So how about it people, can we all learn to live together and make this a better planet for all to succeed, that's one thing that I believe is great about America, when it comes down to it America is a blend of all nations, that's why I laugh when people say they hate Americans, I get it because it's directed at the choices of our Government and not necessarily each individual, I know it sounds corny but I'd like to live in a world where we didn't have any differences that we hold against one another, a world where we're all pulling in the right direction, the direction of good, the direction of looking out for one another, the old way isn't working, it's time to try something new, how about it my fellow humans. If extraterrestrials were to invade OUR planet and waged war against us, I'll guarantee that we'd all get along pretty quickly, at least I hope that's what would happen.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A story well told,"Contrary to some reviews, I don't particularly care if the script took liberties with the real story. This is NOT a documentary but a perfectly good narrative that focuses on three main characters and some equally important secondary ones, who happens to collide during the battle for Stalingrad, in the terrible winter of 1941-42.Vassili is a sniper, Danilov a politic commissar spinning propaganda to keep the troops' moral high and Tania the girl they both fall for. After a shocking opening sequence, the whole film takes place in the devastated city, were everything is in ruin, and no colour is visible expect the brown and gray of mud and crumbling buildings. You definitely get a feeling of the desperate situation these people are facing.When Danilov's stories about Vassili's many killings of Nazi officers attract way too much attention, a top German sniper and high-ranking officer is sent to Stalingrad and from then on it will be a deadly cat and mouse game until the bitter end.Vasilli is an interesting character, a killer with a soft heart, played very well by a Jude Law in his most attractive prime; Weisz is the tough fighter who can manage to look vulnerably attractive even without any makeup and looking realistically disheveled.",7.0,Anonymous,History
simply awesome war movie - one trying to capture the human emotions,"I must have watched this movie more than 10 times and every time I have started liking it even more. First half hour of the movie is as stunning (or horrifying) as can be for a war movie, with young soldiers just out of their teens, moving towards an unknown destination, unaware of their fate/destiny, most of the times even unaware of the cause they are fighting for, forced to fight an enemy with superior arms.The way the human emotion has been portrayed is simply amazing - Danilov's liking (or lust) for Tania, for the same reason his envy and jealousy towards Vassili who was once his best friend, Sacha's believe in Vassili's victory, König's one eyed focus to get rid of Vassili.Generally, war movies lack in the thing that they show just story of one side. This movie prominently deals with the story of Russians, but there is a genuine effort to tell about Germans too. Definitely, this is a story of real people (and heroes) in a real war.An amazing performance by all the actors - Jude Law, Ed Harris, Joseph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz and young Gabriel Thomson - and above all by director Jean-Jacques Annaud.

Vasily Zaitsev...,"""Enemy at the Gates"" is a War - History movie in which we watch a young Russian sniper trying to protect territories of his country during the Battle of Stalingrad. At the same time a German sniper was sent to Stalingrad to take care of him because his reputation and his accomplishments create problems to the Germans.I liked this movie because it is based on true events and in the life of Vasily Zaitsev. The plot was very interesting and the direction which was made by Jean-Jacques Annaud was very good. Since its plot is based on true events makes it even more interesting while we watch what was happening in Stalingrad during World War II. The interpretations of both Jude Law who played as Vasily Zaitsev and Ed Harris who played as Major König were simply outstanding. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Joseph Fiennes' who played as Commisar Danilov and Rachel Weisz's who played as Tania Chernova. To sum up, I have to say that ""Enemy at the Gates"" is a nice, interesting movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it because I am sure that you will enjoy it even if you are not a fan of war movies.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Enemy of the mediocre lineup that is in Australian theatres right now...,"As of July 27, 2001, the films available for viewing in the local theatre are Bridget Jones' Diary (note the proper spelling, publicists!), Doctor Dolittle 2, Evolution, Final Fantasy, Heartbreakers, Moulin Rouge, Shrek, Someone Like You, Swordfish, and Tomb Raider. Then there is Enemy At The Gates. It could be all too easy to dismiss Enemy At The Gates as being an attempt to cash in on Saving Private Ryan's success, but in my opinion, it is a very worthy competitor. I'm sure the Russians who fought in the battle of Stalingrad would feel that at least someone painted a realistic portrait of the hell on Earth that they endured. Of course, the film comes of as being somewhat fantastic, and it came as a surprise to me to learn that                                      Sergeant Vassili Zaitsev was actually a real person (whose sniper rifle is still an exhibit in a Russian museum), but this makes it very entertaining to watch.A lot of historians have it that the battle of Stalingrad was the most unpleasant one fought during the second World War, and this film's set design and cinematography capture that impeccably. When the Russians are battling the Nazis, you get the idea that if the Nazis didn't kill them, malnutrition, tetanus, scurvy, bubonic plague, or a million other things would. Jude Law and Joseph Fiennes lend authenticity to their roles that makes it even easier to follow them on their personal journey through hell, and Ed Harris is scarily convincing as a high-ranking Nazi. The real surprise here, however, is Rachel Weisz as Sergeant Tania Chernova, and the very heart and soul of the film. When she describes the reasons why she decided to take up a gun and battle the Germans, it all makes so much sense that you just want to buy the poor girl a beer and give her a good warm embrace. Not that such things would erase the scars that her character bears, but one would feel obligated to try.Writer/Director Jean-Jacques Annaud, writer Alain Goddard, and cinematographer Robert Fraisse treat the subject matter with great care towards authenticity and entertainment value. It's very tricky to get these two things in proper sync, but they more than manage here. They also don't rely on any hokey photographic effects to tell the story, simply letting you see everything as clearly as possible, letting your imagination do the rest. Anyone who's read anything credible about the inhuman suffering the Russian soldiers endured during this battle will have no trouble filling in the gaps that the narrative leaves about their living conditions. The blood and gore shown during the battles is also very conducive to the atmosphere. Rather than just expecting you to believe that a solider gets his stomach spread all over half a kilometer of pavement by enemy bullets, they show you so you can get a feel for how bloodthirsty both sides in the confrontation were. Even the sex scene doesn't look out of place here.To make a long story short, this is the first film I've seen in a long, long time that I haven't been able to come up with a list of criticisms for. It is simply excellent, and the 7.1 rating it is currently stuck with does not do it justice. It is easily superior to the likes of Platoon, the equal of more esoteric war films such as Three Kings, and even the equal of Saving Private Ryan. Vassili Zaitsev would be very happy that his struggle has inspired such a commendable piece of art - it is exactly the sort of thing he and millions of others like him (on both sides of the German Reich) were fighting for.",10.0,Anonymous,History

"A ""real"" war for those who never saw one","Being a russian I want to say that many russians are offended by this movie. Though it has some real stuff in it, many things are stupid and even abusive. Like russian soldiers being brought to the front line in the sealed cars with barred windows like criminals or some sort of cattle. Or soviet officers only drinking vodka and shouting around. How did they win the war only doing that?A Hollywood director sitting in his cozy chair can't even imagine what was that war like. And I think he doesn't want to. In Russia, we've been taught a little about the war. Stalingrad had a long battle in the middle of a coldest winter of the century. People were starving and freezing to death. And a red-cheeked boy walking around in shorts (at -40!!!) looks like a stupid joke. So does a soldier woman with long painted nails putting on her make-up before the attack. So does the slogan in Russian on the wall ""Long live the socialism"". Does the director really think the Russians were such maniacs to write on the walls how they loved the socialism? ""We will win!"" That's a real slogan from that time.This movie has a lot more inaccuracies but I can't and don't want to enumerate them all.

Open these gates and let people in,"After watching such films as ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Patton;"" I have come to appreciate war films. For this reason, I decided to see the latest war film, ""Enemy At The Gates.""""Enemy At The Gates"" may be one of the best war films I have seen since ""Saving Private Ryan"" because it is executed perfectly. With incredible performances, script and the impact I felt; ""Enemy At The Gates"" sets the tone as the first great war film of the 22nd century. This film can be served as the appetizer to the main course coming out soon, ""Pearl Harbor.""Jude Law, Joseph Feinnes, Rachel Weisz, Ed Harris and Bob Hoskins come together to re-visit the Battle of Stalingrad in 1942. The best thing about seeing each one of the actors perform was they all gave 100 percent effort to make the film as real as possible; they did an excellent job. Fiennes, Weisz and Hoskins were the icing to a cake that was delicious from the start.The highlights of ""Enemy At The Gates"" always came when Law and Harris were on screen because they played excellent psychological mind games with one another to win; furthermore, it was like watching master chess players playing for the grand prize. It was also enjoyable to see the strategies and tactics each would use to out-maneuver the other.""Enemy At The Gates"" drew me with its many action sequences similar to those in ""Saving Priate Ryan.""  Also, the love triangle between the three main leads was interesting to watch and see how it would unfold. I felt like I was in the movie because the writer did an excellent job at making me feel exactly what they felt and experience what they were going through.There is no rule that states dialogue is needed for a successful film. While ""Enemy At The Gates"" has dialogue, the scenes that have none stand out in my mind the most because we see close-ups of both snipers and the expressions on their faces. This is incredible to me because the intensity shown on their faces speaks volumes about what the movie is really about.This may not be the best war film ever made but with two of the brightest young stars on the rise, an actress that is here to stay and a veteran that continues to turn in knock-out performances, ""Enemy At The Gates"" will be remembered for a long time.",,Anonymous,History

A  very good war film set in a battle not  familiar with many people.,"In the of winter 1942 inside a Russian city called Stalingrad the biggest land battle of history was taking place,This is the setting for the film ""Enamy at the gates"".""Enemy at the gates""tells the story of a young freshly enlisted red army solider called Vasili Zaitsev played by Jude Law. From the start we follow the young Russian's journey across southern Russia to the burned out city of Stalingrad,now partly occuiped by the advancing German army wanting to take over Russia.There awaiting him and his fellow comrades are red army officers eager to get him killed on one side and the German army on the other lying in wait to kill him,(These poor lad's didn't stand a chance!).As it turns out Vasili is a crack shot with a rifle and with the help of his new found friend Danilov who is a army political officer Vasili is transfered to snipper division and his name and how many German officers he pick's off day by day is printed then expanded throughout Russia for propaganda purposes.Danilov play's Zaitsev up as a national hero bringing some much needed hope into the heart's of the Russian people.Understandably the German high command are a bit p*s*ed off with this young talented Russian and his snipper division picking off their officers so they decided to send in their own crack shot a man by the name of major Konig to hunt and kill Vasili and his snipper platoon. So what we get is a cat and mouse chase through a devastated Stalingrad.In this nightmare setting Vasili falls in love and vis-versa with a young female solider callled Tania played by Rachel Weisz,concurrently so does Danilov which cause's tension between the boy's,Danilov wanting Vasili out of the way sends him on more and more suicide mission's ,All this lead to a grand finale between Zaitsev and Konig. The battle scene's are very gritty and authentic plus they are shown true to the battle as a no win situation's for both side's.The director use's lots of close up shots in the duals between the snippers capturing the tension and nerve that is with them as they lie in wait for the next kill,Theirs an excellent scene in the film were the snippers are trapped in a building under target from each other and at the same trying to survive a aerial bombardment from the German bombers.The cast which unglued Ed Harris as Major Konig,Josegh Fiennes as Danilov and a very resembling with the help of make-up Bob Hoskins as Nikita Khrushev.All of them including Jude,Rachel and the support cast give applauseable poformance's in their role's and bring the characters to life.This is a well made picture and a breath of fresh air to audience's in the west used to seeing WW2 movie from an American or British point of view,Although it doesn't totally capture the true horror of what the Germans and Russians went through in the east(no film could)it does a pretty decent job never the less and credit must go to the film makers and film company for being brave enough to make and finance a war movie(including a love story as well)that doesn't involve the US marine's.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Awesome head popping action...lol,"When i first heard the story line for this movie i wasn't that enthralled. two snipers duking it out wasn't really my cup of tea. i my self am more use to the ""run right up to people and plug them with a .45 thompson, but when i watched it was really good. you wouldn't think that two people who can bare each other would be much interest but you'd be surprised. you have to feel sorry for the russians at stalingrad, given bullets without a gun, poor bastards. good movie and if you are a fan of Rachel Weiz and\or WW2 then i really suggest you see it.

Good war movie,"I definitely recommend Enemy at the Gates.  It is an epic (my favorite type of movie) with the Battle of Stalingrad as the backdrop.  Its focus is on the battle between two snipers, the Russian played by Jude Law and the German played by Ed Harris.  Two supporting characters are a Soviet political officer played by Joseph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz as the love interest.  Bob Hoskins is also very good as Nikita Khrushchev. Although it is shown mostly from the Russian perspective, it shows the flaws and cruelty of both the Soviets and Nazis.  As a person who is a history buff, I appreciate the large-scale portrayal on the big screen of a historical event that did not involve Americans.Regarding the controversy over the accents used, I personally agree with the decision to not have the actors use Russian and German accents.  The most authentic way to present this event is to have the movie done in Russian and German.  If you think about it, having these historical dramas done in the English language is not completely ""realistic"". Obviously, they are done so to make them accessible to the American audience (and the increasingly English speaking international community) and hence more profitable.  If there are no English speaking characters in the event being shown, forcing actors to speak English with accents does not make it more real.Back to the movie, kudos to the producers for making a tense, gripping, war drama.",7.0,Anonymous,History
The horror of war,"Recently this film was shown on BBC3 I agree with the comments made earlier.This film in quality surpasses Private Ryan in showing the horror of war. Two evil dictators, in this case Hitler and Stalin move their armies in hopeless hideous combat. The earl scenes capturing the horror of Red Army soldiers urged to charge impossibly most being unarmed those who were having little ammunition and then shot at by NKVD for retreating. Ghastly, evil on both sides. The drama and suspense is excellent, the imagery very good. One point though, the leading female actress seemed on occasion too neat for the scenes.Here we see a cruel Kruschev the Stalinist before his dramatic conversion in 1956. The scenes concerning Major König and Zaitsev were excellent.This has to be one of the best war films ever.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Steady hands.,"'Enemy At The Gates (2001)' is set during WWII and depicts the deadly cat-and-mouse game that erupts when an accomplished Russian sniper is elevated to the status of hero by his government's propaganda regime and the Nazis decide it's time to take him off the board for good by sending in an expert of their own. Based on true events that occurred around the Battle Of Stalingrad, the piece initially starts off almost as a 'Soviet Saving Private Ryan (1998)', throwing you (and its protagonist) almost headfirst into a chaotic and crushing skirmish that leaves dozens of Russian troops lying dead on the cold concrete. Soon after, though, it peels away from being an intense, battle-based affair and instead focuses on a series of smaller standoffs that deal primarily in suspense. With solid lead performances and some accomplished direction, the piece depicts its story with a quiet confidence that allows it to remain engaging for its majority. However, it is a bit too long for its own good and suffers slightly from the repetitive nature of its story. Plus, the love triangle at its core comes across as heavily Hollywoodised (even though some accounts imply it has a basis in reality). It's a strained effort, designed to get you more invested in its characters' survival, that ultimately dulls the experience by slowing it down and making it more generic. Still, this is a fairly compelling effort overall that convincingly captures the bleak aesthetic of its war-torn European setting and features a few properly tense tête-a-têtes between its two long-range hunters.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Enemy at the Gates is no enemy of mine.,"If you're a war-movie buff like me, you've seen just about all of them: Saving Private Ryan, Hart's War, Windtalkers, Men of Honor, A Few Good Men, We Were Soldiers, U-571--for time and interest' sake, I'll stop there, even though I could rattle titles off for pages and pages to come.Enemy at the Gates has joined the ranks of these unforgettable war films, which set themselves apart from other films in the genre because men in spit-polished shoes at shoot- 'em-ups is not all that is required. A compelling story has to be the very foundation of the film, there has to be at least a meager amount of activity going on outside of the battle, to serve as a distraction from the chaotic and war-torn events. Enemy at the Gates has the upper-hand to begin with, boasting a powerful concoction of your better actors--Jude Law (The Aviator), Ed Harris (A History of Violence), Joseph Fiennes (The Great Raid), Rachel Weisz (The Constant Gardener) and Bob Hoskins (Mrs. Henderson Presents). Its nail biting twists and turns will arrest your attention throughout this solidly-written script by Jean-Jacques Annaud (Seven Years in Tibet) and Alain Godard (Two Brothers), with more than a few unexpected surprises. To keep the ladies immersed until the end of the 131-minute movie, it even has a little romantic sub-plot, which potentially turns out to be the bewitching undoing of the lead character.The battle takes place during World War II in Stalingrad, Russia, with sharpshooter Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law) almost single-handedly bagging the bodies as promptly as they arrive, though things start to look grim for the Russian troops when the Germans move inward, and Commander Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) devise a ""brilliant"" plan to boost the hope of the civilians with propaganda-laden newspapers. Let the publicity began!Day after day, the underground newspaper reports on the finest soldiers and their number of kills, with the poster-boy Vassili's mug shot on the front page. But it wasn't all work and no play for Vassili. He drudged on like any soldier at war, and even had a little time for a sweet romance with a neighboring soldier, Tania (Rachel Weisz)--though the citizens of the Iron Curtain weren't the only ones reading the tabloid. The German army had been following the heroic efforts of the Russians and had a hero of their own to trumpet, courtesy of Major Koenig (Ed Harris), a highly-focused soldier who obviously worked his way to the top by being the best at what he did as a marksman. He was sent in to counter the efforts of Russia's finest, whatever the cost, and pulled every trick out of his arsenal to ensure Vassili's defeat, which quickly turns into a game of cat-and-mouse.The performances in this motion picture were stunning to watch. Jude Law's character starts to develop early on in the film and continues until the curtain comes down and the lights go up, it'll linger with you. And veteran Ed Harris as Major Koenig dazzles with mystique, and an almost expressionless face that speaks loudly (not to mention how charming he looks in a uniform). The location wasn't too shabby either; the scenic mood feeling raw with muted colors, taking you back half a century with the help of Cinematographer Robert Fraisse (Hotel Rwanda).Enemy at the Gates is no enemy of mine. It'll shake you loose of the slop-stitch handiwork that you have become accustomed to, and raise the bar for craftsmanship in quality movie- making.",10.0,Anonymous,History
pure crap,"What most fascinates me here is the different tastes people have; I simply can't believe it when people praise this film. It must be a joke! It has to be...This movie had nothing good in it except the WWII setting, which I hope would be exploited more. The characters were shallow and acted idiotic, emotional outbursts just came out of clear blue sky and ended in a few cheering words like 'it'll be OK..' It was like watching a cheap soap opera.Acting was terrible (apart from Ed Harris, who, BTW. didn't come across as a character who'd hang a little boy. Why did they have to put that there, wasn't there any other way of getting people interested in the outcome of the duel??? Why doesn't hollywood let us take our own sides instead of pushing us to a situation where there are no longer any options?). Jude Law, who I used to think as a good actor, landed on his butt in this one. He's SOOOO British, that it's kind of hard to accept him as a shepherd from the Urals!All in all, if you liked this movie then a) you're hot for either one of the lead actors and can not think clearly b) have a limited capability of understanding quality or c) you must be joking, which is probably the case.",3.0,Anonymous,History
A good cat and mouse game.,"Ed Harris (the Nazi) and Jude Law (the Russian) are matched against each other as World War II snipers serving their countries.  Joseph Fiennes is also good in a pivotal role as is Bob Hoskins as Nikita Khrushchev and Rachel Weisz as a strong female character.  This is a compelling look at the constantly needed reminder that simply, war is terrible and the innocent victims that suffer is even more tragic.  Director Jean-Jacques Annaud's still framed direction has always lacked a depth of character development but he still makes admirable films for the high end lovers of film art.",,Anonymous,History
Great movie about the Battle of Stalingrad 1942 World War II,"Incredible cinematography!!, High level acting!! and excellent directing!! really good war and historical film!.In this film i found an incredible representation of the Battle of Stalingrad, maybe the bloodiest battle in human history; with so touching scenes that will make you feel highly impressed about this war. The heroic acts of Vassili Zaitzev, are pretty well represented bye Jude Law; the cruelty of the war and its tactical movements are well shown here; with scenes that freeze me, like the killing of the soldiers that cowardly and scared retired from battle; and the air attack to the Russian boats.The movie is about Vassili Zaitzev (Jude Law), a great Russian sniper in the Battle of Stalingrad against the Nazi Germans, and who maintained a sniper's duel with a great German Nazi sniper, Major Konig (Ed Harris), Vassili make a friendship with political officer Danilov, that publish constantly his killings and gave hope to a country that was being invaded by a Nazi empire!About the acting: Jude Law, simply, the best actor in the movie, showing a deep and very human side of a great soldier. Joseph Fiennes, really good as political and intelligent Russian reporter and publisher. Ed Harris, impacting and cold as his character, Rachel Weisz, good acting as a strong and passionate woman. Bob Hoskins and Ron Perlman are good too.Jean-Jaques Arnaud makes it excellent again! 8/10!",8.0,Anonymous,History

Sniper duel stumbles at the gate,"I wanted to like this movie.  The cast and director are accomplished, and the World War II setting is a powerful backdrop to explore poignant themes and flex some technical muscle.After a schlocky flashback showing Vassili (Law) learning to use a rifle under his grandfather's tutelage, we learn of Fascism's spreading blight over Europe in a fantastic newsreel-style animation, then are thrown into a horrific battle sequence.  Red Army troops are sent headlong onto the frontline of the German siege of Stalingrad.  The Soviet troops are dispatched by Nazi infantry, artillery, and air strikes.  Those trying to flee the onslaught are sickeningly mowed down by their own officers.  The city lies in ruin, and in these early sequences Annaud captures the sweeping scale of the siege impressively.Then the movie stumbles.  Vassili meets Danilov (Fiennes), and the duo gain renown and become a touchstone of hope for the Soviets:  the former for his heroic sniping skill, the latter for his bleating about it.  Enter the girl, Tanja (Wiesz); both men immediately begin vying for her once they meet in a palatial 'hovel' maintained by Filipov.The ensuing love triangle continually distracts us from the heart of the movie:  a sniper duel between a Ural peasant and a German aristocrat, Koenig.  The duel is a metaphor for the war raging between Stalin and Hitler, and also one of class struggle.I had not appreciated the startling skills of snipers until I saw Barry Pepper's portrayal in Saving Private Ryan.  Enemy at the Gates does well to display their extraordinary abilities too.  However, their duel is played out over months against the backdrop of an implausible romance, inconspicuous siege, and imperceptible winter.In the end, the technical merit of the production was spotty, with flashes of brilliance as vivid as the sprays of blood it depicts.  I must credit Harris' Koenig for being immediately despicable (it only takes seconds for you to hate him), and Hoskins' ruthless and engaging Khrushchev.  Law, who had just played Dickie Greenleaf in The Talented Mr Ripley prior to this film, demonstrates unexpected range and intensity in this role.6 of 10",6.0,Anonymous,History
A human story in a harsh battle environment. Superb!,"Enemy At The Gates is a film that I have gone to see, not because I have heard rumours about its budget, not because I was bombarded in the media about how it is filmed, how many great co-stars and stars were in it, but simply because I happened to go see it with my friends and it was on the Battle of Stalingrad, with no great expectations. I knew Jean-Jacques Annaud was a good director but I didn't know how he could manage to make a war film, as all his previous stuff were human stories (yes, even L'Ours was) and didn't involve too much action; I mean, Name of the Rose is hardly in the same league as your average Steven Segal film, is it? When I walked out of the theatre, though, I was stunned. I was so absorbed in the film that I didn't even notice how the time passed. I felt the Battle of Stalingrad, I was there, I shared the terror in the faces of the army recruits when they see the battle for the first time when they open the train cart's gate, I felt the Soviet soldiers' dilemma when they were either killed by the Nazis if they went ahead or by their own commanders if they returned. It was the best film set in war that I've seen in a long time, and is surely in the same level as with Tora, Tora, Tora. Besides, I was sort of right, as Annaud had made a war film based heavily on a human story which made it even stronger. The Enemy at the Gates may be compared to the first 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan, but while that film then becomes a classic Spielberg film in the latter stages, this one remains that tense for the whole length of the film. The acting of Jude Law and Gabriel Marshall-Thompson (the informer kid), Bob Hoskins, and of Rachel Weisz are very neat and makes you be part of the story, but it is Ed Harris that makes the greatest impact. Harris has charisma leaking down his trousers, something that can be equalled only by the likes of Sir Sean Connery, Bob DeNiro, and Jack Nicholson. Besides, the script is very well-written and very well-fitting, plausible, and convincing. This film which shows us how to do a film that represents the war is heads and shoulders above the $270m flop Pearl Harbor and surely is one of the best films of the year, along with Hannibal and Shrek who lead, to my opinion, their own genres in the past season. 	Anyone who is interested in World War II, or in films that show the human condition, must watch this film. It's a must-see. Really!",10.0,Anonymous,History
More educational than entertaining,"The pluses of ""Enemy at the Gates"" much outweigh the minuses. In all, the movie was an effective display of brutality in war, and of some of the nonsense that goes on not only in war, but in the world, that leads to bloodshed. Often what makes a film is great acting from all the minor characters. In this movie, the minor characters outshine the stars in every instance. I think of it more a warning than a spoiler to state that Perlman, whose character the viewer knows will die, is killed almost as soon as he is introduced. People expecting to see more from him should expect to see what amounts to a large cameo instead. However, he does dominate while on screen, and does have the major line of the movie, about the sickle and the hammer. The three Russian leads are drawn with some compassion and humanity, but they don't stir a lot of interest, and the actors playing these roles are the worst at enunciating and expressing their words. You basically have to guess at what they are saying, and that is unforgivable. It is more important to convey the message and characters than to simply speak with thick accents. Indeed, it is Sacha and his mother who dominate the story, although they don't appear that much. And it is the quest of the mother in the end that draws the viewer instead of the quest of the lead character. Gabriel Thomson gives an incredible performance as the tyke, Sacha, and Eva Mattes is downplayed as the mother, but does admirably in her small screen time. The plot is probably one of the weak points here. Its hard to make excitement out of ""cat and mouse"", and the story takes heavy theatrical license. The director makes the mistake of showing whole scale carnage that can't be escaped early in the film, yet tries to persuade the viewer to believe the lead character and the German sniper can only be killed by each other. Of course, younger viewers will appreciate the larger than life characters and accept this, but mature viewers will be puzzled by the directing, which means they're paying more attention to the method than the story, a bad sign for an entertainer. Still, there are more truths than fallacies to the story, and it is enlightening. The directing and film editing look splotched. Sacha, for example, just magically appears in the presence of the German sniper. There are other examples. But the director redeems himself overall. The last sequence involving Ed Harris and Gabriel Thomson is extremely effective. Looks more like a classroom educational film with marginal entertainment value than a blockbuster, but overall a film with more pluses than minuses.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Yet another fine movie ruined by a love story.,"""Enemy at the Gates"" really looked like a promising movie when it came out in 2001. The end result didn't disappointed me but it's still a shame when you think about it how much better the movie could had been.Loose the love story for starters! A love story on the background of a heavy historical battle simply is out of place and takes away the pace and make the movie less believable. The whole love triangle thing really gets even annoying after a while and the weak 'Hollywood' ending also didn't do much good to the movie.The best scene's were most certainly the sniper scene's. Also the battle's were filmed with lot's of profession and visual style. The sets and costumes also added to the historical feeling of the movie and still make this movie a good one to watch.Jude Law and Joseph Fiennes did a good acting job as the two main characters. Ron Perlman also shows up in a (too) small role. I really got interest in him after seeing this movie back in 2001 and I'm glad to see his career is doing well at the moment.Certainly not the best war movie ever made but still enough stuff to excite the WW II buffs.

Fantasy Stalingrad has no relation to history,"Enemy at the Gates completely misrepresents the history of the battle and slanders the brave sacrifice of the Soviet people to defeat Nazism. I strongly recommend reading the book 'Enemy at the Gates' to see how little of the movie is true.The story of the sniper is one small story in the book that was complied from hundreds of interviews with veterans from both sides. The story of the sniper was significantly changed for the film from the true story which is much more compelling.All the Generals who actually led the battle are ignored in the film except Kruschev. Kruschev was Political Commissar at the Front level and was involved in the overall planning of the defensive battle and the encirclement of the German 6th army at Stalingrad. He did not command the 62th army in Stalingrad, this was General Chuikov, a true hero. The entire battle was commanded by Marshal Zhukov ( the general who never lost a battle ) in close collaboration with Stalin. After the death of Stalin, Kruschev had his role inflated and Zhukov, Stalin and Chuikov ignored.There is no sense of the battle in the film either at the unit level or overall. The Red Army used firegroups of 25 men armed with bags of grenades and sub machine guns to fight the Germans house to house in the rubble. There was little of the human wave tactics portrayed in the film. Building were fought over room by room and floor by floor. No one went in the open as this was certain death to either side.The battle consisted of the Red army holding on to a tiny corner of the city while the German forces were ground down. When the Germans were weakened, Soviet reserves north and south of the city broke through the weakened flanks off the Nazi forces and surrounded the entire 6th Army and part of the 4th Panzer Army.The 6th Army was Germany's greatest strike force, the same one that conquered France so quickly. At least 330,000 German soldiers from its elite force were killed or captured. Only about 10,000 survived to return to German after the war.Germany never recovered from this loss and it marked to start of their defeat.Please read the book Enemy at the Gates and forget this terrible film",3.0,Anonymous,History
Another prime example of why I hate Hollywood.,"""Enemy at the Gates"" may be seen by your average historian as a good war movie.  Things like ""based on a true story"" heighten it to some level of importance and integrity.  The reality of it, and many films like it, is that it's just another cliched, contrived piece of Hollywood claptrap that is neither interesting nor inspiring.  Put aside all of the hollywoodishness of the story structure and style of the movie, it fails on a geometric level to even maintain the casual viewer's interest with entertainment value. Whether this was made by a huge corporation which recycles film formulas or not, ""Enemy at the Gates"" is quite tedious.  The ""love story"" is hackneyed and unengaging because of it's own cliche.  The set-ups are never paid off with satisfactory conclusions.  The characters are uninteresting because they wallow in their own cardboard cut-outness.  This isn't even a good Hollywood movie.  In terms of style, one can sense the ""Private Ryan"" rip-offs running amok.  Huge explosions and gunshots are filmed at a similarly fast frame rate as the battle sequences in ""Saving Private Ryan"". Now, despite all of the cliches and imperfections of ""Private Ryan"", that film DID break new ground with it's style and vivid battle sequences which linger with the viewer long after the closing images.  ""Enemy at the Gates"" is just a boring, uninteresting retread of war movies and pointless love-triangles that is as much a failure to innovate as it is to captivate and entertain.  It's just another example of why I hate Hollywood and avoid it as much as I can.",,Anonymous,History
9/10,"Ordinarily I don't watch war movies because they are usually dank, dirty, depressing, bloody, full of casualties, and sometimes hopeless. I see and read enough about war to want to watch it as entertainment. I am, however, a fan of historical films and the historical nature (however inaccurate) of ""Enemy at the Gates"" intrigued me. Although the movie didn't go into the entire history of WWII it took two individuals that had pivotal roles in that war in the battle of Stalingrad.I liked the performances of Ed Woods and Jude Law as two snipers on opposite sides. Watching the two trying to outsmart the other was like watching a chess match except with shooting. Their individual battle within the overall war had enough appeal to keep me entirely engrossed in the movie waiting to see the next move. And the ending did not disappoint. In fact, the ending could not have been any better. This was truly an excellent movie.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A vivid portrayal of an aspect of WW2  rarely seen in western movies,"This move is not for the squeamish. It portrays the horrors of war very explicitly. It is in my experience quite a rare one too. I've never seen a WW2 film from the Russian side before and was worth watching for that alone. One is left with the distinct impression that Russian soldiers were just as likely to be killed by their own army as the Germans. It is well known that the Soviet army suffered the heaviest losses in WW2 but in seeing this movie, especially the opening scenes, one cannot wonder at it when you see unarmed infantry being sent into enemy fire under orders to pick up a weapon when an armed comrade is killed. For them it must have been worse than 'going over the top' in WW1! The sheer callousness of the Stalin regime is brought out very strongly in this film. Mosty of the film of course was about the snipers. That was very vividly portrayed with lots of tension without losing pace even though it included a story of love and jealousy between two of the key characters. On the whole it was an excellent film that held me to my seat more so than anything I've seen in a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Enemy At The Gates is a welcome breath of fresh air.,"Enemy At The Gates:      THEATER SEE RATING!This movie, unlike Saving Private Ryan, is a movie for the thinking  movie goer. Not that Saving Private Ryan is at all a bad movie, because my review of it is nothing but nice, but everything in that movie is S-P-E-L-L-E-D out for you. Some of the critiques I have read on `Enemy' actually say that they should have built(S-P-E-L-L-E-D) the characters more in this movie for it to be compared to and as good as S.P.R. WHAT?! They're people with `class' differences in a war! Pretty Easy! I don't want the movie to deal with character building that I can figure out on my own.(also it makes an already long movie, too long) So actually Enemy At The Gates is a welcome breath of fresh air. Not only do I like it for the symbolisms and messages (possibly hidden to the layman movie goer) , but it has lots of action and twists(both physical and mental.),and finally because it has a `real Feeling' to it. First lets cover the messages and/or symbolism, hidden or maybe not so hidden as long as you can... think. I don't want to give it away but one of the `hidden' features has to do with the fact that some people that saw this movie and then see my review will say `What does he mean, he likes the `real feeling' of the movie? They don't even have German or Russian accents!!' BINGO For those of you who say this, you are a `As long as its entertaining' moviegoer(layman) and although you will also think this is an excellent movie, guess what ? You didn't get it!! Or maybe you didn't understand the use of, or think it was right to use women and children in this movie, well all I can say is `strike two. Do you want to go for strike three?' This is just 1 example of a hidden message that is present throughout the movie.( not even the major one) So anyone reading this, like a friend said to me `Al, You don't go to a movie just to watch it, do you?'  I will say to you, `neither should you!! And if you do, shame on you.' Now as I stated before the action and twists will have the layman moviegoer enjoying this movie as much as I did. You know how you turn to someone your with and say this is going to happen and that is going to happen and then boast `how do I know? because I wrote the script. Ha Ha' well you'll end up with egg on your face like I did! Even the part with the boy, which becomes semi-predictable, is at first hard to figure out.(At first I thought he was going to do what they tell the mother he does at the end)  Yes that's right, just when you think the movie will end one way or another, it doesn't. There is also lots of shooting and shells blowing up and bodies everywhere (in fact the beginning is very similar and comparable to `Ryan' , which is of course important in a war movie. But remember girls this is not just a `war' movie so please don't miss it. But truthfully ladies this also is NOT A ROMANCE as I have sometimes seen it wrongly billed. I am not a critic that likes to tell you the movie while critiquing it(DON'T READ this next line if you don't want to know one part of the movie) but the relationship between Jude, Fiennes and Weisz is another symbol of the class struggle going on throughout the movie(oops gave up 1 of those `thinking' aspects of the movie) and is NOT A ROMANTIC ONE, ie, the part where Jude is writing letters back to his `fans' and is being corrected his misspellings by Fiennes as we find out Weisz is an ex university student and owns hundreds of books.(where will she fall? On the side of the proletariat/fascist(Fiennes,Harris,Hoskins) or with the bourgeois(Law). It is a great war movie that has symbolism and meaning which happens to put you through a lot of emotions, and  therefore, is for one and all. And as for the part earlier where I said this movie has a `real feeling' to it, due to not wanting to give away any more of the symbolisms of this excellent movie, I wont elaborate on the reality of war.(hint, hint)In fact the only criticism I have for this movie is that there could have been a better script(only for dialogue sake) written.

A Generation of Soldiers Lost to the Hell of War,"There might well be minor historical inaccuracies in this rare film, showing the Bravery & contributions of the Red Army in WWII, but as a Personal Witness to the aftermath while traveling through the old Soviet Union less than two decades after the event....being dumbstruck at the almost total absence of a generation of Males (not to mention the thousands of Russian women who fought alongside and gave their lives) in the 1941-1945 battle with a German Army to which Stalin had mistakenly given free reign in the belief that Hitler would be Honorable....this tale tells the turning-point of the horrendous Battle of Stalingrad as a small corps of Snipers led by Vassily Zaitsev (who's rifle I witnessed prominently displayed in the Kremlin Museum) gave their fellow countrymen Hope by their stealth in picking off, particularly Wehrmacht Officers in the Ruined City, eventually leading to the loss of a million German soldiers....who otherwise might well have been at Normandy in what might well have crippled our own efforts to successfully engage our troops in Continental Europe.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Great Sniper Action,"One of the better more underrated war movies of our time. This one was better than alot of movies made. It was robbed of the number one spot by Exit Wounds which i thought was a very lousy movie. I like Jude Law. He is an awesome actor. He has a lot of potential to be great one day. Rachel Weisz is beautiful in this movie. I totally fell in love with her in this movie. Bob Hoskins plays a general. He does great! You cant even tell its really him underneath his big beard. Ed Harris plays the most outstanding role as a cold hearted, patient yet sadistic sniper. I have never seen anyone get the sniper role down like he does. The smirk and craftiness he carries shows a slight arrogance. His focus is great and his skills with the rifle are unhuman. I believe never to see anyone convince me the way Harris did as a sniper. If youre into the whole sniper bit i recommend this movie to you. The war sequence isnt bad either but it mainly focuses on the two snipers.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Smashing good movie,"There is something odd about Russian peasants talking in articulate, middle-class British accents, but it works. I'm not sure why. Something symbolic about the nobility of the common man?Ed Harris doesn't bother with accents either. In fact, nobody does. It's probably for the best.This is a pretty gripping movie, as is any movie where the lives of all the characters can end with the mere squeeze of an index finger from some unseen place.Watch this movie. Despite what you might read here, it's a lot better than rubbish like Saving Private Ryan.

Watch at you Own Risk,"The movie was okay, lots of blood.  I wonder if the snipers only shot on the head, or could the shot to another vital organ like the heart or the neck? Anyway, everything is casual; acting, plot, make-up.  The only thing that I found really well was the location, but not the special effects that they did on it.  Also Ed Harris did a great performance, one of the best characters in the film.  Besides all this, the movie is okay, but they could have done a lot better.  So if you have the opportunity don't take it, see something else.  In my opinion, calling this film the best of 2001 is a little over the top.  The movie is not bad, but is not good either, its just okay nothing great and nothing worst.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Serious inaccuracies,"This film has about as much relationship to the actual history of the Battle of Stalingrad as the ""Sound of Music"" has to the real von Trapp family. About the only accurate portrayal is that yes, there really was a Vasilii Zaitsev who really was one of the hero snipers of Stalingrad.Of all the errors the one I find most egregious is the complete omission of one of the true heroes of Stalingrad: Vasilii Ivanovich Chuikov, the general who took command of Stalingrad in Sept 1942. The man who declared ""We will hold the city or die here; there is no land beyond the Volga!"" Gen. Chuikov, whose tactics and use of ""storm groups"" and snipers held the desperately beleaguered city through not only house to house battles but floor to floor in the same building. To omit Chuikov from a film on Stalingrad is like omitting Patton from a film on the Allied advance across France.This is not simply Hollywood license; this is a distortion of history. It speaks to the contempt that the film's producers hold for the American viewing public that they had to use Khruschev because his name might be recognized rather than present historical fact.",3.0,Anonymous,History
"Trite, predictable, awful","A heinous waste of time.  Other than a few very brief scenes they manage to make the Battle of Stalingrad, often described as the most horrific episode in the history of the world, seem ""lovably rustic.""  For the middle 8/10 of the film you have no sense that people are starving, thousands are being slaughtered, the very existence of the Russian nation is at stake.   They pay lip service to these facts, but all you see is the unspeakably juvenile love triangle between the three leads.  If they want to show us ""the human face of war"" the least they can do is make the relationships slightly more complex than an episode of Blind Date.  And the only civilians shown live in a wonderful little cellar that's spacious and comfortable enough to make most Manhattan residents jealous. Want an example of how bad and predictable the action sequences are? A:""Stay down.""  B:""Oh no, the planes are coming."" A:""Don't move, the sniper will shoot you!""  B:  ""We have to run, the planes are coming!""  A:""Don't move!  The Sniper!""  B: ""I must run!""  If you don't see that B is going to get a bullet in the head at the end of this, then maybe you'll find this a gripping suspense film. The worst sin of the movie?  Instead of showing us the struggle of two opposing soldiers set against the backdrop of a sweeping historical event, they make the historical event ALL about the two men, even saying (over and over and over) ""Whichever sniper wins, that will decide the war!""   Talk about delusions of grandeur, the struggle of tens of millions of people mean nothing against the fates of two men who have such rugged good looks and great agents.",,Anonymous,History
Russians loved it!,"I didn't know that movie was coming. So when I just saw Jude Law interview and movie shots from ""Enemy of the Gates"" - I wanted to see it desperately as I like war dramas, actors involved - Jude was great in ""Talented Mr. Ripley"", when I found out that Rachel Weisz was also there - that was just WOW! And well, I'm Russian. How could I miss that one? Luckily it was in Russian movie theaters at the beginning of April. Beginning of the movie, introduction of the characters was great. Jude looked as believable Russian soldier. Rachel Weisz was incredible, I can't stop admiring her beauty, and yes - she looked very Russian as well. As it was said here, finally there was given some credit to Russians for beating fascism. The movie is superb. It's romance, suspense, war drama. You care a lot about characters. The plot got some nice twists and wasn't banal for a minute. Love scene was amazing. The acting is great, Jude and Rachel were awesome. Hoskins, Pearlman did a great job. About Vassily Zaitsev - I'm 20 and many people of my age don't know him here in Russia. So he is not that well-known hero now, that movie will remind of him and other millions sacrificing their lives, struggling for future of their wives and children, not comrade Stalin. The truth about NKVD and penal battalions was never revealed during Soviet regime, it was not in any history books until USSR collapse. That was never showed in war dramas of Soviet period. It was interesting to see the historical moments live with the help of sound and visual effects. I can tell that there were no laughs about portraying Russians by Americans in this movie like it was in Armageddon, etc. I read a lot here about British accent, but I watched it dubbed in Russian. It was good. I'll check later on DVD how was the original dialogue. The spelling in letters seemed to be correct (comparing to other movies like Virus, Saint, etc. - I can't stop wondering why American movie makers can't hire some immigrants who talk and spell Russian, but no - they literally translate some stuff which sounds so stupid, and yes - fake Russian sounds funny for us). It would be interesting to find out impressions of Soviet veterans about the movie. People applauded when Hoskins introduced himself as Krushchev, he acted great. By the way he played communist leader Beria already in some movie about Stalin regime few years ago. At the end just want to say that many friends of mine loved the movie and acclaimed it as superb.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent,"If you enjoy WW2 films as much as i do, then this will be for you. It is not your classic war film like Bridge On The River Kwai or The Guns Of Navarone which have classic war film actors like Alec Guiness or Gregory Peck but has Jude Law as the hero and Joseph Fiennes as friend and senior to Jude Law. The film is set in Stalingrad in 1942 during the German invasion of Russia and focuses on a real life hero Vasili Zaitsevf (Jude Law) who has grown up in the Urals. Zaitsev becomes a sniper and takes out many of the German officers forcing the German leaders to send in a professional-Major Konig- to kill him.

Not so bad,"First of all, read the book, The War of the Rats if you want to know what really happened during the battle of Statlingrad. Obviously, this film is not the most historically accurate, thought it does have some outstanding tactical examples of small unit fighting.I could have done without the love story. What made this film good was the duel between Ed Harris and Jude Law. Rachael Weisz had a pointless role and I certainly would rather have seen more historical evidence in place of the love affair.I think the filmmakers would have done better to make the viewer understand how awful a battle this truly was. If there was a turning point on the Eastern Front in WWII, it had to be the Battle of Stalingrad. It had nothing to do with the exploits of one soldier and his girlfriend. In place of some of the overly-dramatic scenes between Russian soldier and commissar, how about showing the audience more background on things such as the German Wehrmahct's tactical supremacy over the Red Army, or the Soviet leadership's inability to lead.Still, this was more entertaining than it was good, and I found my viewing to be enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Not as great as I thought it would be,"I don't know what I expected in this movie. I suppose that's why I waited so long to see it. I had noticed that a lot of people had watched it, and many liked it, quite a bit. What finally got me to see it was that I heard, and mistakenly so, that Rachel Weisz was nude in it. She is not, though you barely see the top of her butt. VERY disappointing. The story was okay, and the actors did fine. Joseph Fiennes and Ed Harris are always great (though I do NOT recommend seeing Pollack) as World War II Sniper guys trying to ""off"" each other. Rachel was not as beautiful, except for MAYBE that partial nude scene. If I were you, I would not waste my time.

Better than Private Ryan,"The first 30 minutes of Saving Private Ryan may have been the best war footage ever shot. The first 30 minutes of Enemy at the Gates is at least as good. And the rest of this remarkable feeling is better -- for its clear-eyed view of the war on the Eastern Front, the story Hollywood never tells. The struggle between two totalitarian leaders, Hitler and Stalin, was the most bestial and ferocious battle in history. The film opens with an unbearably horrifying tableau in Stalingrad. The Russian conscripts, without enough rifles to go around, are sent armed and unarmed to charge a well-entrenched German position. They are slaughtered by machine gun fire. As they run back to their own lines, their own officers open fire on them, shouting ""deserters will be shot."" From this shocking beginning, we are offered a vision of war in which there are no winners, no right side and wrong side, in which all but the leaders are victims. Enemy at the Gates is perhaps the most honest film ever made about war. It has subtle, trenchant observations about the nature of propaganda and of genuine heroism, and its depiction of Stalingrad (now Volgograd) is as compelling and realistic as anything put on film. There are a number of exceptional performances. Three young English actors -- Joseph Fiennes, Jude Law and Rachel Weisz -- offer a superb ensemble performance. They make their unglamorous characters utterly and compellingly human. Yet they are overshadowed in a career-best performance by the American actor Ed Harris, who in his maturity is emerging as one of the finest American actors of the century. There is a strong resonance of Burt Lancaster in his prime in Harris's nuanced, brilliant performance, where every gesture and every facial expression is invested with meaning and depth. Bob Hoskins is terrifying as the calculating and brutal Nikita Sergeyevich Khruschev, who made his name as a political commissar at Stalingrad and later succeeded Stalin as dictator of the Soviet Union. There is a superb cameo as well from the rarely-used American actor Everett McGill, who had the starring non-speaking role in the director Jean-Jacques Annaud's film Quest for Fire. Yet it is the central performances of the three young people that carries the film and gives it emotional weight. Annaud weaves their performances into an intimate glimpse of what it is like to fight for rulers in whom you have no faith, against an implacable enemy, all the while trying to retain a vestige of your humanity. Fiennes as the disillusioned propagandist Danilov -- a Jew who becomes a political commissar to escape persecution -- is very good; as is Weisz. Yet it is young Jude Law, in a performance even more impressive than his role in The Talented Mr. Ripley, who fills the screen nearly as well as Harris. If Law continues to be this good, he could very well grow up to be the next Michael Caine. A first-class film all around, and the only ""must see"" movie of the year. Far better than Pearl Harbour (which I rather liked, despite its old=fashioned sentimentality), Enemy at the Gates is war at its most elemental -- a raw struggle to defend all you have and are.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Good but not great,"There is a lot to recommend about this film that is essentially the story of the duel between a Russian and German sniper set against the backdrop of the Battle for Stalingrad in the Second World War. This is a well made movie that benefits from European direction and seems less bombastic than American made Second World War efforts and is all the better for it. There are good performances her as well especially by Rachel Weisz as the female lead Tania and Bob Hoskins is a fantastic supporting role as Kruschev. Joseph Fiennes is also very good as Danilov. My major problem with the movie is Jude Law. I just do not get the appeal of this actor. He seems to deliver the same performances in every movie I have seen him in, and for me this only worked in AI. This resulted in me not being able to invest in the lead character and I felt it also led to Ed Harris completely dominating there duel from an acting perspective (does he ever deliver a bad performance). This is a shame because the rest of the movie is excellent. Though I am not sure how much weight can be given to the historical accuracy (not that much from what I red on IMDb). In the end I enjoyed this film but Law puts me off wanting to watch this movie again unless there really was nothing else to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Epic fight sequences ruined w/pointless love story.,"This could have been a great film and it had a lot of potential...too bad it's ruined w/meddling love story.

This could have been a good flick about Stalingrad, but that seems to be secondary to the completely forced love story/jealousy garbage which is a shame.

Real Zaitsev before Stalingrad was head of financial department and during the battle wrote two books to prepare snipers!Hrushev. This man was shown only because Western spectators may heard something about him (being one of USSR bonzes in 1960s). The real hero of this battle - General Chuykov - was not even mention.Political correctness...Jewish girlfriend (despite real Zaitsev's Russian wife), homosexuals kissing in Russian army 'night party' before battle... this don't deserve being mentioned.Summary: even although the movie was made by French team, it is as far from truth in showing the battle and characters of Zaitsev and Russian soldiers, as it was made by a Marsian team.Vote: 2/10 for great visual effects.",2.0,Anonymous,History

Not great but Still a Must See,"What was the Battle of Stalingrad like? Probably nobody knows exactly, even if they survived it. We can guess -- house to house, floor-to-floor, and room-to-room killing in the bombed remnants of stone and concrete shells of buildings, basements, sewers, and wreckage, throughout a large, destroyed city, hundreds of thousands of men intent on killing each other, all this going on month after month for how long -- it had to be a hellish pandemonium that defies imagination.This film tries to bring us into that pandemonium. To an amazing degree, it succeeds. Maybe not everything shown is accurate. But many scenes ring true enough. More than one source has claimed that Russian Army punishment was severe for retreating soldiers, and that families were threatened if their son got captured, or surrendered. We know some of the Volga crossings were bloodbaths, as were clashes throughout the ruined downtown. The bombings, the shelling, the snipers, the civilian and military life driven into and under the rubble, we know these things happened. This movie brings us there, in so much detail, you can't get it all in one viewing. The sets are simply amazing.Along with all that great stuff, Jude Law is cute, and same for Rachel Weisz (somehow she defied the odds and grew even more beautiful 11 years later in the Bourne Legacy).So what's missing? Well, the writing could be better. Jean-Jacques Annaud made his first (and apparently only) try at feature screen writing in this film. Why they let him do that, who knows. What couldn't a real writer do with this material? Stalingrad was the the mother of hell on earth! The Nazis were in a mortal drive to the Caspian oil fields. And the legendary Russian snipers! The film brings us Vassily Zaitsev, a real life legendary shooter. Why stop with him? Some of the best Russian WWII snipers were beautiful young women! The lovely, 19-year-old Ludmilla Pavilchenko (over 300 kills) was honored -- while the war was raging -- in London and Washington, even receiving gifts of a 1911 Colt and a Winchester rifle at the White House, before she returned to the war. Another sweet young killer, Roza Shanina, had 54 confirmed kills. It gets even more perfect: Vassily perfected a system of snipers working in threes. You want a story, maybe with a love triangle? The drama practically writes itself. Annaud does put one young woman sniper in the action (played by the lovely Austrian Sophie Rois), but her role is horrible, and short -- she knows how to work her trade in a bombed-out rubble of a department store, but when a wave of German bombers flies over, she panics and runs out into the Nazi shooting gallery.The story: a love triangle. Smart guy makes a good try, but loses pretty brilliant girl to honest farm boy. But it doesn't hold interest, with the exception of a great love scene. Subplot 11-year old becomes a double agent, somehow passing from the German-occupied rubble mounds to the Russian-held sewers and basements pretty much every day, never even getting very dirty! The final shootout seems tacked on without much thought.Back to those incredible sets. If you get pay per view, make sure there's a rewind option for this one.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Controversial,"As a Russian - This film is good in the sense that it can bring some attention to the battles Russians fought against Nazis. I guess it is the only English title on this topic, while this front was the biggest, hardest and bloodiest one. From the other side it is full of myths, ""western"" myths about Red Army in WWII. There were no ""zagradotryad""s in the city of Stalingrad, beside that ""zagradotryad""s were never deployed right behind attacking forces, shooting their backs. Instead there were behind front lines catching deserters (some were shot, but most of them were sent back) The river crossing at day light under Nazis shells and bombers do happen - but only ONCE, and it was HIGHLY critical for holding the city at that moment. Russian soldiers were not taken as sheeps into Stalingrad, they fight for their motherland, and everybody knew about significance of this citadel. And much much more, but, I can only recommend (to those who are interested in topic) to read excellent book by Michael Jones ""Stalingrad: How the Red Army Triumphed"". As far as I can judge, it is free from Anti-Communist as well as Communist myths, and based on veteran's interviews - very easy to read.",6.0,Anonymous,History

But, another expert comes in named Koening (Harris, in fine form as always) who will fight to the death.  The film has un-needed side plots (a love triangle doesn't sound as real in a non-fiction story) and has the British actors and actresses keeping they're accents when playing Russians (that got annoying after a while).

Entertaining but falls short,"Enemy at the Gates will disappoint you if your expecting an accurate portrayal of the WWII battle for Stalingrad. The battle is used more as spectacular backdrop for its own story of a sniper duel and a love story. The movie has the feel of a New York Times bestseller, where fast paced action, plot twists, and romance, are combined into a familiar formula designed keep the audience entertained. For the most part the acting was well done, too bad no effort was made to speak one word of Russian or German or at least use an accent.The one part that this movie does shine is the set design and costumes. If you rent the DVD don't miss the behind the scenes look at how they created Stalingrad, yes, that's not a typo, they recreated Stalingrad from the ground up. That combined with excellent cinematography makes you feel like you've been transported back in time into this battle of epic proportions.

Snipers Go to Battle Amidst a Battle,"Not a typical war movie as we don't see too many films that show the Germans fighting Russians. The setting is the Battle of Stalingrad, and I see a lot of criticism in the reviews regarding the battle. Either, its inaccuracies when it came to the battle, or simply not expounding on the overall battle. First, movies are generally flexible when it comes to historical accuracy, and should be expected. Second, the movie's intention is not to focus on the general battle. It is simply the setting of a sniper battle between the protagonist and antagonist... that's it. Understand what you are watching and watch it for what it is, not what it isn't. If you can do that, you will see that this was a truly entertaining and amazing feature film.Ed Harris is the charismatic German sniper that I found myself very much respecting up until the end. He is very technical and strategic, even cut-throat, making him the best the Germans have to offer.

A Big Disappointment,"Firstly, I must say that my review is not unbiased. I am an avid WWII historian with a deep fascination of the Russian side of it. The Russians suffered over 20 million dead in that war and bore the major brunt of the Nazi defeat, yet their contributions are virtually ignored in this country. So when I learned that a major movie was being made about the pivotal battle of Stalingrad, and from the Russian perspective no less, I was giddy as a school boy and counted the days till its release.What a letdown. I walked out of the theater feeling cheated.A brief storyline. The movie follows Vassili Zaitsev, a young Russian soldier thrown into the hell of Stalingrad. He turns out to have quite a talent for picking off Germans, and his story is latched onto by an ambitious political officer who inflates his deeds in the Soviet press to almost mythic levels. The Germans catch wind of his fame and dispatch an expert marksman of their own to bring Zaitsev down, and a duel of the Stalingrad snipers begins.First I'll point out what I liked about the movie. The technical accuracy was superb. The uniforms, equipment, and scenery were all dead on the mark (I did catch a glimpse of a Soviet helmet with a post-war Czech liner, but that's splitting hairs). They even made the effort to replicate some famous Stalingrad landmarks, and the special effects and cinematography were masterful. The highlight of the movie was when he gets off the train and sees the battered city for the first time from across a corpse-strewn river, a river that he must now cross.Now for what I hated:1. Even though the movie was taken from the excellently written and entirely factual book of the same name, the movie itself is pure fiction. In fact Zaitsev's story takes up all of two pages in the book. Much like with Braveheart they took a bare skeleton of actual events and pretty much made up everything else. This to me is a great and unforgivable sin.2. The love scene. It was totally inappropriate and unnecessary, not to mention it looked like he was killing her rather than making love to her. Did the producer hope to draw in women viewers with that crap? Certainly no war movie buffs that I know want to see that kind of garbage.3. Zaitsev's character. Vasili Zaitsev was in his 40s when this story takes place, and he was a trained sniper. He wasn't a Hollywood pretty-boy with gel in his hair.4. The ending sequence. I don't want to spoil things for anyone, but these two supposedly 'expert' snipers violate every known rule in sniperdom. They weren't quite Johnny Rambo, but the sniper game is one of stealth and patience, and neither one display it.But I guess my loudest complaint is that this movie had sooooo much potential, and this story sooooo needs to be told in this country. However, instead of sticking to the facts and appealing to purist nutcakes (like me) they had to pollute it with their Hollywood 'improvements' in an attempt to market to a mass audience, which only succeeded in alienating everybody. This could easily have become a great classic war movie like Patton or Band of Brothers, and I truly mourn for what could have been. Go out and buy the book, you will be a better person for it.

Very effective thriller with only a few dead spots,"When Vassili Zaitsev first arrives at the Russian front in Stalingrad, he finds himself stuck in one man's land and, before returning to his own lines, takes out five officers with one rifle.  Looking for a morale booster, Political Officer Danilov uses Vassili as a hero to spur the other men on.  However when the Germans' morale falls due to the snipers, they bring in Major Konig, an expert sniper, to hunt down and kill the Russian hero.  Thus begins a game of cat and mouse between the two men.For some strange reason I had got the impression that this film was slow, overlong and dull.  I can't remember where I got that impression from (maybe unfair critics?) but it stopped me going to the cinema to see it.  As it was, I really enjoyed the film and was very pleasantly surprised by just how good it was.  I expected something full of pretension and long, slow pauses but instead it was am effective little thriller which was tight in the right places and only a little baggy and slow at times.The film manages to give a good impression of the war in Stalingrad and, while not totally up to `Private Ryan' shock power, the opening 15 minutes are very realistic and very powerful.  After this point the cat and mouse game is simply done but pretty exciting.  The only aspect that I felt slowed things down a tad was the romantic subplot involving Tania.  This didn't help the pace of the film but, with the way the film goes, was a necessary part of the plot overall.The cast are good all round, with even small roles taken by well known actors.  Law is very good in the lead and he holds the attention well whether lying totally still or having a crisis of confidence.  Fiennes is not quite as good but is still OK, his character is less clear and is very much secondary to Law's.  Weisz is OK but it is hard to accept her clean skin and beauty in a character such as hers, she doesn't do a bad job, but I think it could have been better with someone else.  Although Harris doesn't say very much he has a great screen presence and his character is strong for that as opposed to development.  The support cast includes Bob Hoskins and Perlman.Overall this is not a perfect film but it is very atmospheric, with a great sense of time and place and the main game of cat and mouse is very enjoyable and quite tense.  Much better than I expected it to be.",,Anonymous,History

They misrepresented Khrushchev.,"Historical epics usually make for good movies, but ""Enemy at the Gates"" has a few problems. First and foremost is their portrayal of Nikita Khrushchev (Bob Hoskins). They cast him as a pure Stalinist, when in reality he was famous for ""de-Stalinizing"" the Soviet Union.As for Vasiliy Zaitsev (Jude Law), Maj. Konig (Ed Harris), Tania Chernova (Rachel Weisz), and Commissar Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), I guess that everything that I know about him I learned from this movie. I think that someone needs to make a movie about the siege of Leningrad (I spent this past semester in St. Petersburg and went to a museum about the siege).",6.0,Anonymous,History
Mixed feelings about the film,"Overall, I like it.  About time credit is given the tenacity and sacrifices of the USSR for defeating Fascism.  Production is good: sets, costumes, FX, soundtrack.  For the most part, combat carnage is presented with historical, visceral authenticity.  But characterizations hurt this character-driven film.British accents are distracting to the American audience which hears them as ""exotic"" (similarly if Russians had been played by Americans with Brooklyn or Dixie accents).  This is probably less distracting for the European audience.  I would prefer subtitles.  The letter-writing scene with spelled-out -- in English! -- vocabulary was particularly jarring. Likewise, interjection of modern slanguage (""Whatever."" ""take him out"") and use of the term ""Krauts"" (Russians said ""Fritzes""). But the problem lies less with language or accents, than with how the characters relate to eachother.  They don't interact in any way remotely Russian. They don't communicate like Russians.  Difficult to put a finger on it, exactly, but obvious to one who has spoken with many veterans, and read hundreds of wartime journals and post-war memoirs (even translated to English).Then there's the romance.  There actually was a relationship between Zaitsev and Chernova, his sniper protege and eventually lover.  She was not the shy intellectual, though, but a hardened Partisan obsessed with killing Germans. The fully-clothed sex scene in the tunnel/bunker is realistic, if one discounts Weisz's over-emoted multiple orgasms.  The brevity and griminess are certainly realistic.  Reviewers complain about the surrounding soldiers slumbering through, but combatants were chronically sleep-deprived and fatigued, to the point where they could drop-off standing, despite the constant barrage of shelling.  Handled well, ""Enemy's"" romance might have succeeded.  Instead it brings to the film the most nauseatingly insipid dialogue since the blitherings of Jack and Rose in ""Titanic"".  The love-triangle is plain boring.Sasha: ""Enemy's"" adorable kid was actually a 15-year-old, German-speaking master-cobbler.  At least he is accurately portrayed as a ""double-agent"" and his fate true to life.I would have preferred enactment of the overall Battle: street-to-street, house-to-house, constant advancement and retreat, desperate defenses of tenuous territory.  Even so, the sniper duel as microcosm does give the film focus, not a bad thing.  There is doubt about the actual occurrance of the legendary hunt, but that's ok, too.  Soviet propaganda extolled the feats of many heroic role-models like Zaitsev.  (Another was Lilya Litvyak, a Jewish female ACE fighter-pilot.  Prominently featured in front-line newspapers, her fame attracted the Luftwaffe's attention.  Litvyak had her own legendary duel, defeating ACE Graf von Einsiedel in aerial combat.  Her lionizing by the Red Army press led to her demise: she was ultimately shot down by eight Messerschmitts drawn to her distinctively painted Yak.  Since feats of Soviet heroes were always embellished by the propaganda-mill, the question of Zaitsev's duel's authenticity is moot.My biggest gripe with ""Enemy"" is the propagandic agenda.  Not Danilov's -- the filmmakers!  The producers go overboard to prove they are not in any way ""commie sympathizers"".  There is way too much anti-communist baggage in this film!  Yes, the Stalinist regime was evil, and the ruthless NKVD and blocking troops, and true, the Soviet command unadverse to throwing poorly-trained, poorly-armed human waves as cannon-fodder at the enemy. But too much focus is placed on these cruelties of the Soviet system for the average western audience to empathize with the protagonists.  History buffs, Eastern Front enthusiasts and Russophiles will get past the anti-Red rhetoric.  But too many westerners will continue to misunderstand the fervor of the Soviet people to defend and die for their Motherland.  In Russia today, the Great Patriotic War is still everpresent, with monuments everywhere to the fallen millions.  It is traditional for newlyweds to visit them and donate their wedding flowers before departing on honeymoon.  In its zeal for ""political-correctness"", the film does a disservice to the Soviet *people*, the true heroes of the Eastern Front.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Jude Law in a war movie- what's better than that?!,"I, being a big History buff and huge Jude Law fan as well, was very pleased with this movie. It has suspense and at some moments I gasped out loud. It was touching and well done in my opinion. Of course Jude Law gave an excellent performance, but I must credit the other actors in the film for their work as well. Everyone did a really good job on the making of this film! Also, the music was awesome- James Horner- one of the best! I have to do a bit of research to find if there is a soundtrack or not: IMDb doesn't have a listing if there is. So, I hope there is a soundtrack because the music was awesome, as I already said before. On a last note, this film was great and Jude Law looked really hot in his little uniform and helmet! :)",9.0,Anonymous,History
"It is a very good movie, but just a little slow paced","OK, OK, I have to be honest. I've seen ""Killing Me Softly"" and ""Forever Mine"" and I have a little crush on Joesph Fiennes.

A fair beginning; Hopefully the first of many films of the Russian front.,"The story of a duel between a Russian peasant enlisted man sniper and a Prussian aristocratic Nazi officer sniper during the WW2 battle of Stalingrad. Vasily Grigoryevich Zaitsev, the Russian sniper, was very real; but some doubt has been cast over the historical truth of the personal duel. Because it is a member of a much too rare breed; movies about the most momentous land battle in history, the Russian front, this movie falls short on many levels, it tries to give some sense of the scale of events, and early on it succeeds; but it retreats before the sheer immensity of its historical context into a personal story; and in the end it's almost as if the war has stopped so these two can shoot at each other. Other than that it weaves historical content into a human story, the nature of totalitarian regimes and the indifference to human life that the Red Army displayed early on, the Party involvement in morale making, the front line role of women etc; it was enormously refreshing to see a story told from the Soviet side; almost all prior movies on the subject were Nazi-sided (See Peckinpah's - Cross of Iron). It also contains excellent action shots; making the humble bullet a mighty dangerous object again, as it should be. Though it falls down in not being able to devote enough money to huge battle scenes (almost every German vehicle sighted is stationary); and so cheats on a real sense of the battle, it's good for what it is. Those who like historical war films can only hope that the true balance of land fighting of WW2, ie: the Russians with some help from the Western allies toward the end; starts to be reflected in cinema; at least Enemy At The Gates has given a start.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A Fantastic Concept Squandered by Appealing to Hollywood,"Enemy at the Gates started out strong, with a concept absolutely brimming with potential for a truly great war movie. New perspectives and the in-built tension of a sniper duel ensured I was all the way in for a wild ride. Instead I got a Saving Private Ryan rip-off with tropey love triangle and a metric truckload worth of suspension of disbelief hanging over it. It was so over-Hollywoodised it was laughable, as in I was actually laughing at moments that were meant to be serious because I couldn't believe what I was watching. Is this movie just such a product of its time that it hasn't aged well? Because it hasn't. It's exactly what you'd expect from a middle-of-the-road Hollywood war movie from the early 00s. And this is all without mentioning the questionable editing that cut away halfway through tense scenes. I give Enemy at the Gates a better-luck-next-time 5/10. The only things saving it from a more damning rating being the long-distance interchanges between Jude Law and Ed Harris as they attempted to outwit each other. That element of the movie was pure gold. It's just a shame about literally everything else.QyrosMovies.",5.0,Anonymous,History
its grace,"I am not fan of war films. but Enmy at the Gate is real special. not a surprise for Jean Jacques Annaud. but an useful discover of the manner to present a delicate subject. sure, the love story, the friendship who becomes rivalry, the psychological battle between a simple peasant and a brilliant officer, the propaganda , the pink sacrifice of Danilov and the end are only ordinary, easy solutions for conquer large categories of public. but the revelation remains the performance of Jude Law, surely, too refined for a peasant for Ural but inspired for use the possibilities of a becoming star of propaganda, preserving his simple nature. the grace to build his Vasily Zaitsev is the basic virtue of film. the second good surprise is the Khrutchev of Bob Hoskins. sure, the Stalingrad is far by the sketch from this film. the Soviet regime, suggested in few traits, are profound different by the image from Enemy at the Gates. but it is not a documentary. and the title, who reminds Hannibal in front to Rome, has the gift to define the universal significance of the story.",,Anonymous,History

"Heavily flawed, but quite entertaining...","ENEMY AT THE GATES*** 1/2 stars out of 5 (7/10).""Enemy at the Gates"" is entertaining and well made. Its heart is in the right place, and the director isn't an amateur. Nonetheless, this war movie is anything but perfect.Vassili Zaitsev (JUDE LAW) and Political Officer Danilov (JOSEPH FIENNES) are two Russians behind Nazi German lines during World War II. Using the only rifle available, Zaitsev snipes 4 or 5 Nazis, saving the life of himself and Danilov. The two quickly become great friends. One day, the Fiennes character suggests to the Russian leader Kruschev (BOB HOSKINS) that the Russian people need a hero to boost morale during the battle of Stalingrad. Using his writing skills, Zaitsev quickly becomes the Russian hero; being the ultimate sniper and the ultimate soldier. The Germans find out about it and send their own killing machine; Major Konig played by ED HARRIS. They must eliminate this threat. That's what this movie is about; a duel between two snipers at Stalingrad.I am giving this movie a positive rating, but I'm gonna be doing a lot of complaining. There is a beautiful female soldier named Tania Chernova (RACHEL WEISZ) who becomes Vassili's lover. Danilov also likes this girl, and becomes increasingly jealous. When we first find out that the Jude Law character and Tania are ""in love"", we originally had no idea. In fact, a child tells Major Konig that the two will probably get married, and that's when we first find out. As I was watching, I wondered ""When the hell did all this happen?"" The two characters had barely talked or glanced at each other, and now we're under the assumption they're in love. I think the director himself noticed this loophole. Zaitsev and Chernova get down and dirty on the ground a few minutes later. That's not the way to correct a mistake. We're supposed to understand that they are in love because they have sex; it's all clear now. Of course, I'm being sarcastic, but it was one of the film's biggest flaws; the potential love triangle. It is material that belongs in soaps, and not on the big screen. I'm not saying these kind of relationships aren't possible in the movies, but how they are executed determines whether or not they should be on the the silver screen. It was both over-the-top and unneeded. I think this film is a true story, so the triangle may or may not have happened. In the film, it was poorly executed. That's all I'm trying to say.Again, this film can be very entertaining, and it has more than enough heart. At times, I felt like I was playing ""Medal of Honor"", but most of the time war is not seen as fun; which is another positive. All of the performances were A-grade, especially from the great Ed Harris.Even though I spent most of this review complaining, you should know that it's worth a see. It was skillfully made, and it keeps your attention. ""Enemy at the Gates"" is inspirational, well- acted entertainment...why else see a movie?",7.0,Anonymous,History
The best war film in years.,"A great film, telling the tale of a sniper in the conflict at Stalingrad during the Second World War. Many interesting and breathtaking scenes. Similar to Saving Private Ryan, but superior to it, the film takes as its centrepiece the duel between a German sniper (Ed Harris) and his Russian counterpart (Jude Law).

Mediocre and disappointing,"Once again we see that all the money in the world thrown into a movie can't make up for one good screenwriter. This is the biggest problem with ""Enemy at the Gates"", the screenplay is poor and in no way memorable. Full of stock characters, dialogue and situations, it plays more like a high-budget school pageant then a truly gritty war drama. As much as I admire Jude Law, he is very miscast in the role. He has the face for the role, but he needs to dispense of his British accent and refined ways if we are to really beleive he is a Russian peasant. Joseph Fiennes' character is underdeveloped. The love story is merely an annoying distraction, tho that may just be my bias. I would prefer to see this as a ""buddy"" picture or even more. The electricity generated between Fiennes and Law often suggest as much, and I would love to have seen the emotion between them developed more.The battle scenes are entertaining and impressive, but more surreal than real. That could be great, but I don't think that was that the artistic intent here.Then there's the ""soul stirring"" musical score. ""Sounds like Titanic."" I thought. Sure enough, music is by James Horner.Anyone who thinks this is a great war epic, hasn't seen many, but at least it wasn't dull. Indeed, the main reason I enjoyed Enemy at the Gates was for the mesmerizing beauty of the two male leads.  But it waste of their acting talents.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Good war story that meanders off point,"This is a war-within-a-war story based on a real WWII Soviet sniper upon whom the Soviets built much of their morale boosting war propaganda. Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law) is an extraordinary marksman, pressed into service as a sniper in the Soviet army.  Through a combination of effective sharpshooting and relentless coverage by propadanda minister Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), Vassili becomes a Soviet hero and a German nemesis.  In response, the Germans send their best sniper, Major Konig (Ed Harris) to find Vassili and take him out.  The result is a deadly game of cat and mouse where the lines between predator and prey blur.Director Jean-Jaques Annaud (`Seven Years in Tibet') also collaborated in writing the screenplay which is mostly riveting, but too often loses focus. The film is generally well directed with an authentic wartime feel to it. While some have criticized it for looking too much like `Saving Private Ryan', I feel such a comparison is a compliment.  Using outstanding cinematography as a model, and coming close to duplicating it is a positive, not a negative.  There has also been a lot of criticism of the fact that the Russians don't have Russian accents and the Germans don't have German accents and thus it isn't realistic.  I find this criticism ironic and without merit.  How someone can accept as realistic the fact that all the characters are speaking English and then criticize as unrealistic the fact that they don't speak accented English is beyond me.My main criticism of Annaud is his inability to stay locked on the main storyline, the story of the snipers.  He feels compelled to throw in a meaningless love triangle and lots of other fluff that really add nothing to the story.  The time would have been better spent delving deeper into the minds of the snipers and creating additional suspense filled confrontations.Jude Law gives a fine follow-up to his outstanding performance in `The Talented Mr. Ripley' showing that he is here to stay.  He strikes an excellent balance between Vassili's sense of duty and reluctance to be a hero, showing a character that is compelled to be courageous when he is really scared.Rachel Weisz also turns in a strong performance though her character is totally superfluous to the main story.  Bob Hoskins renders a fabulous wartime Khrushchev.  Ed Harris is good as the German sharpshooter, but this is not among his better performances.  Joseph Fiennes is also very good, although his is another role that is overemphasized needlessly.This is a very good film that lost its opportunity to be great because of Annaud's inexplicable need to wander from a great storyline.  I rated it 7/10.  It is a good wartime thriller worth a look.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Mysterious thriller,"I can agree that the film has a lot of oddities from the point of history. Sure in 1942 the Russian Army did not suffer such a shortage in weapons as they did in 1941. Sure at the battle of Stalingrad officers did not say to soldiers that they would find their rifles in a battle. And special NKVD troops did not force ordinary regiments to assault shooting them from behind. They did that with the penal battalions mainly (which were formed of both officers and soldiers committed some crimes such as cowardice, looting, deserting, self-inflicted wounding and so on). But all those things did happen in the Eastern front so who cares that the did not happen at this particular place in this particular time. Anyway this war is still unknown to the West. I was pleased seeing allusions to the old neglected Russian Ballada o soldate - Ballad Of A Soldier (Jude Law resembles young Ivashov and Aliosha was a prototype for Vassiliy, both love stories started in echelon) Producers called the film a mysterious thriller and I would agree with them. The questions raised in the film stayed unanswered: Why and what for did the Russians struggled in that war and how they could win. They did not fight for loot definitely, they did not protect their rights since they did not have any. The usual Western answer (according to some books and Hollywood productions) is that they were propaganda addicted, slaves by nature, robots, speaking machines. But Law's character was not. Even a peanut named Volodia, Vassiliy's assistant, when captured by Germans did not even try to change his destiny, did not betray his friends. He put on the German uniform and was shot by the man whose life he saved. Germans kept saying that they had come to liberate them from bolshevism, Russian soldiers did not have any weapons, they suffered from propaganda and coercive violence from both their chiefs and German forces but they fought, made love, danced, survived and won many battles in comparison of which Al-Alamain looks like a petty bicker. When Tarkovskiy's Ivan returned from his missions he got a glass of vodka and a piece of bread, and sometimes a little bit of candies. Major Konig gives Sasha good portion of ham and a lot of chocolate. But Sasha helped Vassiliy and never Konig. Yes I agree that Konig's execution of the kid does not look natural. But on the other hand. What Konig was doing in Stalingrad in the middle of nowhere? Yes, he was a soldier and had to do his duty. Sure. But what should be his choice when he realized that the execution of the kid was the only way to complete his mission? Why should he stop doing his duty at this particular point? Sasha was not sure the first non-combatant kid killed by fair people doing their duty on that war. He was not even a non-combatant.Summarizing: I like the film. Actors were great (though Law was a bit emotionless trying to play innocence). It was a good try.",,Anonymous,History
One of the Best War Films of All Time - Enemy at the Gate,"Saving Private Ryan had been one of my favorite war films of all time. It has been replaced by this film. That was not a very easy task to complete, but the director, actors, and production crew of this film accomplished the impossible; surpassing the brutality of D-Day and the American invasion of Normandy as seen in Private Ryan, the previous champion of outstanding beginning sequences for a war film.The opening sequences of Enemy at the Gate are far more brutal than Saving Private Ryan, and the visceral audacity of giving one soldier a rifle and a second soldier instructions to pick it up after the first soldier is dead is far beyond the call of duty of the American soldiers in Private Ryan, where each soldier was well-armed. The characterizations in the film are unforgettable, and the actors involved will never be able to surpass these roles in their entire acting careers. The story is first-rate, and the supporting cast is impeccable. The music by James Horner is one of his best scores as well. And I loved Hoskins as Khurshchev. I will always consider Saving Private Ryan one of my top 100 films of all time because of its incomparable mother at home scene losing so many sons in the same war, but for action sequences, suspense, and a study in survival, it is surpassed by Enemy at the Gate.

This movie is better than what you see in the trailers,"I went to see this movie the first week it opened because nothing else was worth paying the $8.50 it costs these days to watch a movie.

However, you are not informed that it is about the war between the Russians and Germans during WWII.For those who do not remember what they learned in their high school world history class, the Russians are fending off the more powerful and well-equipped Germans who are having difficulty taking over Stalingrad, the heart of Russia.  The Russians are desperate because they do not have enough weaponry to fight their German counterparts.  When it seems that the Russians are doomed, Commander Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) develops a strategy to bring hope and honor to his people.The propaganda starts when Danilov makes a hero out of Vassili (Jude Law), Russia's best sniper.  Danilov puts Vassili in the front page of every Russian newspaper painting a picture of a courageous and gifted soldier who intimidates the German military. When the Germans send major Koenig (Ed Harris), their version of the best in the world, to kill Jude Law, the Russians realize that their tactics are working.  The duel between Major Koenig and Vassili gives Danilov the ammunition he needs to write about his hero and provide his country with the hope that they need to survive.

Going in, I really didn't have much more than general background knowledge of the Battle of Stalingrad and its significance in World War II. I had also never heard of the sniper duel that took place there, so I can't comment on historical accuracy. One scene I found particularly enlightening is the scene where Bob Hoskins ""explains"" why the Nazis must never take Stalingrad.This movie offers an exciting and intense struggle without the flag-waving and speech-making that usually accompany war movies. The ongoing duel between the two snipers, Jude Law and Ed Harris, is absolutely riveting. Even though he didn't have a German accent, I thought Ed Harris was excellent as the Nazi sharpshooter. The love story has been criticized by some, but I actually thought it was well done and the love scene between Law and Weisz was actually very appropriate given the circumstances. 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,History
The Hell of War,"I was stationed in the military not many years after WWII;  I had the chance to visit the major cities of the then Soviet Union, and this film is a very accurate portrayal of what I've been told by the survivors. We so easily dismiss the Russians, but more (by far) died at Stalingrad than all Yank soldiers in the whole of WWII. This films easily portrays the scope of the major battles moreso than any predecessor including ""Saving Private Ryan"".

"Movie war / drama / romance, all in one.","This film portrays the Battle of Stalingrad, considered by many the turning point of World War II, as it was the first crushing defeat of the Germans. The film focuses its history in Vassili Zeitzev, a soviet sniper who caused many headaches to the Nazis, killing his officers on the ground, something that was used by the communist propaganda machine to encourage the morale of Russian troops, worn by unstoppable advance of the Nazis. In this film, the story of Zeitzev intersects with Tania, a Russian girl who volunteered to help the forces defending Stalingrad, giving birth to a romantic plot that intersects the main one. Directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud (who also wrote the screenplay with Alain Godard), the film has Jude Law and Rachel Weisz in the lead roles and also features Joseph Fiennes in the role of a political commissar, Bob Hoskins, embodying the Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev, and Ed Harris in the role of a German professional sniper sent by Hitler to kill Vassili.The wartime love is a theme that has made great films. One of the most notable was obviously ""Casablanca"". This film, however, takes place not only in wartime but in the midst of one of the most raw and bloody battles of the war, which makes it more interesting as it is not just a romance or a drama, nor a ""conventional"" war film. It's a bit of all three genres combined. The sound effects, soundtrack, visual effects, sets and costumes are noteworthy for their realism and attempt to portray the combat scenario. The actors were also very good, especially Ed Harris (who has got used to doing tough-guy roles) and Weisz (finally a movie without mummies and Egyptian stuff). Jude Law and Fiennes, together, deserve a special greeting as they were able to incorporate very well the emotional and psychological conflicts of his characters, two friends in love with the same girl.As more negative marks, I point out the lack of ""chemistry"" between Weisz and Law, which should have been more crafted by two actors. Some dialogue required a greater commitment on the part of writers. Also I don't understand how Khrushchev was involved in that battle when, in reality, it was led by Georgi Zhukov.A good war movie, worth seeing because it will please both those looking for action as for those who enjoy a good drama.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Grim movie about a grim event,"Well done movie with a reasonably good story set against an incredibly grim event. The most common set decoration seems to be dead bodies. Fortunately, but perhaps unrealistically, the bodies never seem to be in an advanced state of decay. Also, the movie (perhaps thankfully) does not much go into the fate of the residents of Stalingrad.The movie has a very American viewpoint. The Germans are wholly evil, and the Russian government is wholly evil. (Bob Hoskins is great as Khrushchev.)

"could have been great, turned out a failure","The movie starts with some scenes ripped off from Saving Private Ryan, only not as good and not as shocking. None of the characters seem real (not even Jude Law, otherwise a great actor -Gattaca). There is no way anybody could be fooled even for even a brief moment that this is not a film. At the end of every scene that went wrong somewhere (cliché/not compelling/bad acting/shallowness/ combination), I couldn't stop thinking that this could and should have been a great movie, as both its basic story, theme and setting offer vast possibilities for this. There were too many characters in this film as well and you can't possibly relate to all of them. Most of the characters seem incredibly naive. It's been a long time since I've seen anything like this. Even most of the (combat) scenes are naive, until Jude Law and his newfound 'love' start doing it in a room filled with sleeping soldiers. This is without a doubt the most shocking scene in the movie (mainly because they all seem like oversized, dumb, innocent children instead of soldiers), but I'm quite sure this wasn't intentional. Ed Harris' play is ok, only he seems to be forgetting that he's not supposed to be a friendly guy in the story until all of a sudden he commits a horrible crime at the end of the movie (his 'nice guy turns nasty'-performance doesn't cut it in other words). Joseph Fiennes as Danilov is just plain ridiculous as are most of the other actors, who for the most part just play caricatures of past roles.

Thoroughly Enjoyable,"First let me just say that saw this film on television so I may have missed some bits that were edited out for whatever reason.I though the film was enjoyable. The story moved along at a nice pace, there were various subplots to bolster the film when the pace starts to lag, and the acting was good. What more is there?I liked this film, it was romantic and I don't mean the romantic love sort, though there enough of that, the characters in the film emoted a sort of romance, a kind of noble what-have-you nonchalance in the bleakest of conditions(and gosh was everything grey and weary, afterward I had to reassure myself that the world actually comes in Technicolour)that I suppose only war films could create.My one complaint is that I find the Joseph Fiennes character rather unbelievable. Here is an educated intelligent man who is brought down by his emotions. His final scene with Jude Law I thought to be unbelievable, his bitterness toward his government comes as a surprise and his suicide can only be described as rash and impulsive. I would have thought that his character is would be ruled less by his heart than by his head.But other than that, it is a movie to just sit back and enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Great movie,"This movie really did an excellent job of displaying the struggle of war on the Russian front. War is hell, and it was worse on the Russian front. Stalingrad is regarded as the most brutal battle of World War 2 and I believe it. I believe this movie is effective in proving it. Ed Harris did a great job of playing his role of the German sniper, Major Koenig. I think they could have found someone else to play the role of the Russian sniper, Vassily Zaitsev, but he did fine. I just think someone with a stronger personality like Matt Damon would have fit the role better. You can't find anybody better than Bob Hoskins to fit the role of Nikita Kruschev. He was perfect. The artwork was excellent. This movie showed the brutality of both sides, but I am sure it could have gone farther which I am glad it didn't. There is only a certain amount of brutality necessary to get the point across. It was not 100% accuraate which is why the movie is basically banned in Volgagrad, but why does anybody expect 100% from Hollywood. It is just a great movie",8.0,Anonymous,History
The annals of mediocrity awaits.,"From the moment Jude Law utters his first words, in a distinctly upper class English accent, the illusion of a Russian setting is destroyed. With the notable exceptions of Ed Harris and Bob Hoskins, none of the 'major characters' attempted the relevant accent, and Hoskins slipped from Russian to 'cockney' with alarming frequency. Jude Law neither looked nor sounded Uralic. I know this shouldn't matter, black actors have played Henry V and Olivier played Othello, but somehow it does. The irritating young boy, irritating by his very omnipresence, sounded and looked like a Dickensian urchin transported into mid 20th century Russia. Please Directors take note, we really do not mind subtitles! The film evidently bears the scars of serious 'cutting'. The connection between the opening opening battle scene, probably the highlight of the film, and the following scene is never fully explained. Fiennes' character, and infact the entire pseudo political slant, is never fully developed.Ed Harris' performance saved the film, restricted to only a handful of memorable lines, the depth and dignity he was able to bring out of his character manage to spare the blushes of director, if not managing to spare the film from the indignity of it's place in the annals of mediocrity.***/*****",6.0,Anonymous,History
Who'd have thought i would like a war film?,"Im not usually into war films, and i have to say that the battle of Stalingrad never particuarly interested me. However, this film was really good and i found it really compelling.Jude Law is good as the heroic sniper, who becomes very well known for his expert shooting. Ed Harris I think stole the show as the 'bad guy' German Sniper who plays a game of cat and mouse with Jude Law.Even though the film was really good, and kept with the facts, i felt that the love triangle involving Jude Law, Joseph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz was a bit pointless. I find it weird that every film - no matter what its genre HAS to have a love story somewhere. Never mind though.

One man really can make a difference!,"Although the special effects were very realistic, way too much emphasis was given to the Russian snipers dual with the German sniper.  A truly great book, ""Enemy at the Gates, The Battle for Stalingrad"" tells the full story of the German 6th army's successful invasion deep into Russia until they were stopped at Stalingrad.  While the movie concentrated on 2 central figures (the 2 snipers), the book goes much more into detail on how the Germans failed to support their flanks in the large areas outside of Stalingrad, poorly protected by their Hungarian allies.  The fierce fighting to take control of the city lasted many weeks, from August 1942 thru January 1943 but it was the successful counterattacks outside the city that surrounded the 6th army and spelled its doom that was the real story of this battle.  This was the most important battle of World War 2 that totally changed the momentum of the war and if you watched this movie you missed all these important facts.  What happened to the 6th army after they were surrounded by the Russians and were ordered to ""hold fast"" and not retreat from Stalingrad while their army was still strong enough to break out and make a run for it would have made for a much more enjoyable and educational film.  If you do not know the full story of Stalingrad, you can watch this film and not have a clue how the Russians end up winning this key battle (although you do learn which sniper wins the dual).  If you are going to make a movie with the exact same title as the book (""Enemy at the Gates""), it would help if you followed the book a lot closer than this movie does. 2 stars out of 4 in my opinion.  I was horribly disappointed in the film for those reasons.  If it had followed the book, it could have been so much better.",1.0,Anonymous,History
A cat-and-mouse duel between two snipers,"To be perfectly honest, I watched this film mainly because Jude Law stars in it, he's very talented and one of my favorite actors to watch so I decided to give it a try. And I'm glad I did, because Enemy at the Gates is not only a great film but one of the best war films I have seen. The story takes place during World War II and is based on real events: Germans and Russians are fighting over every block of Stalingrad and the city is in ruins. Russian sniper Vassili Zaitsev, (Jude Law) stalks the Germans, taking them out one by one, thus hurting the morale of the German troops. The political officer Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) leads him on, publishing his efforts to give his countrymen some hope. But Vassili eventually starts to feel that he can not live up to the expectations on him. On top of that he and Danilov fall in love with the same girl, a female soldier called Tanya(Rachel Weisz). From Germany comes the master sniper König (Ed Harris) to put an end to the extraordinary skilled Russian sniper... The film's visual style is grand, the battle scenes are chaotic and extremely well made and so were the sequences that show a devastated Stalingrad. Art directors, editors and cinematographers, all did a terrific job. But the main storyline is the cat-and-mouse duel between the brave and heroic Vassili and the cold and driven König as each sniper tries to stay one step ahead of the other. Jude Law's performance was subtle but very efficient, but his British accent will probably bother the purists. The supporting cast made the most of their roles. A special mention to Ed Harris who was very convincing and menacing as the German Sniper König. Many have commented that the love triangle feels out of place but for me, it's just another side to a great story. Overall, Enemy at the Gates is a very nice film, technically superb, and a must see for those interested in the war.7.5/10",,Anonymous,History

"Good Story, But Film Doesn't Capture It","I have to confess that I had to watch this movie twice before it finally made a positive impression on me. The first time I could only take about half an hour before I turned it off. Somehow the whole thing seemed muddled and confused and it just didn't capture me. I watched it a second time mainly because it was available and I thought I must have missed something. It is better the second time around.Basically, this is the story of the Battle of Stalingrad, told largely through the eyes of two opposing snipers - Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law) fighting for the Soviets, and Major Konig (Ed Harris) for the Germans. Vassili becomes a national hero as the sniper who almost single handedly is wiping out the Nazis, and Konig is sent to Stalingrad by the Germans for the sole purpose of taking him out. The two put on excellent performances in their respective roles. Of the supporting cast I must say that the only significant impression left (and it's interesting that it left a significant impression because it was a relatively minor role) was by Bob Hoskins, playing Nikita Kruschev as a political officer in the Soviet Army.The battle scenes are graphic, so be warned if the sight of blood upsets you. The sets are brilliant, and make you feel as if you have indeed been taken into the middle of a war zone. The psychological aspect of the confrontation between Vassili and Konig is well portrayed by the respective actors. So there's a lot of things going for this movie. Having said that, it still left me a bit dry.There just doesn't seem to be enough here to sustain a movie for two plus hours. How long can you really stay excited about watching two snipers play a cat and mouse game? How long can you really maintain your attention level watching two snipers simply watch for each other, waiting for each other to make the first move? The movie descends into that several times, and - I admit - my attention did wander. I'm quite certain this story was probably better as a novel, where the psychological aspect of the confrontation could be played up more significantly.It's a decent enough war movie, though, and even with that fundamental weakness, it's still worthy of a 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Moving & Well-Constructed,"A few hours ago I saw this film at a special advanced screening at which the director, Jean-Jacques Annaud, was present. The film was unlike any war film I've ever seen -- it was aesthetically done, especially the beginning, and the story was easy to follow. There were many suspenseful moments in the film, truly ingenious so as to make them unpredictable. The cast turned in spectacular performances. Jude Law was truly the star, and he should have gotten first billing. He expressed a range of emotions that will truly grant him more challenging roles in the future. The role of Ralph Fiennes was slightly exasperating, but his performance was commendable, much like in Shakespeare in Love. Rachel Weisz, who was very funny in The Mummy, proved here that she can handle serious dramatic roles as well as comedic-adventures. Ed Harris did a great job as the general, completely believable and sinister without being a ham. This is a highly recommended film. The plot was engaging, the scenes captivating, and the direction spectacular. Annaud said he was interested in historical fiction because there are always great stories to tell. That is undoubtedly true here.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Not very realistic, but well-made","That the director of this movie knows how to handle his craft is visible from the very first scene, where the soldiers arrive in Stalingrad and all of the explosions & grand vistas are perfectly choreographed. There are many other such scenes in the movie as well, personal as well as grand.The trouble with this movie, for me at least, is that none of it feels very real; it feels exactly like a Hollywood war movie, a film for people who love action movies. This isn't simply because all of the ""Russians"" speak in English (I have to give them props for at least not attempting to do a bad Russian accent), but because none of the characters really seem ""real"". All of them are, in true Hollywood fashion, larger-than-life; they say and do things that you don't think actual people would do in those situations. Frankly, I think that the best acting is when you do not realize that the characters are acting. In this film, I definitely realized it; this film's purpose is primarily to entertain, not to show the truth. This is fine for some types of movies but not, I think, for a war movie; this film glamorizes the war, makes every person a hero, and shows us more of an aristocrat's view of the war than a soldier's. And of course, there is a love story as well. ;)This movie has practically nothing in common with the philosophy of Russian war movies (which are generally much more honest); it's really a Hollywood interpretation of the war in Stalingrad by people who were not there, and there are times when they really misinterpret the situation. Khruchev, the future Soviet leader who oversaw the defence of Stalingrad, is portrayed in this film as a dangerous drunk; in one scene he actually gives somebody a gun; ""perhaps you'd like to avoid the red tape""! Somehow, this doesn't seem very likely from the leader who later revealed Stalin's crimes in front of the whole country after his death, freed thousands of political prisoners, and took steps towards more openness and freedom of speech. This portrayal of Khruchev is a relic of American Cold War propaganda, and it reminded me that I have to watch this film with a grain of salt.It's certainly an exciting movie, but for an authentic view of Russia's side of WW2, you'd have to look elsewhere. I HEAVILY recommend Elem Klimov's masterpiece ""Come and See"", which is perhaps one of the most honest and brutal war films you'll ever see. As likely as not, you'll never want to watch another Hollywood war film again! Another good choice is Tarkovsky's ""My Name is Ivan"".

Another historical misconception from Hollywood to demonize Communism.,"I may say, for those who just want to get entertainment and see a war movie, this will do fine, it is good enough for a nice evening.For those seeking the historical truth, this movie is an outrageous shame, constantly trying to divert the attentions to facts that really didn't matter at all, if we do a transparent analysis.The Director spent all his time worried about demonizing the Russians and Stalinism, rather than demonizing the true villains (germans) and emphasizing the glorious role of the red army at world war II. If the Germans had passed Stalingrad, they would hit the Caucasus petroleum fields paralyzing the Russians, and the result would probably be the victory of Nazism, and we wouldn't probably be here today. Besides, not a single fact about Stalingrad's importance was shown. Do you know that 2 million Russians died on this battle alone, Mr Director? (That number is, by itself, 4 times bigger than the number of American casualties in the whole Western front). And let's just not refer that 25 million Russians were killed, close to 80% of the total WWII casualties!But hell no Mr Director, it doesn't matter that the invaders were the Germans, it doesn't matter the brutal massacre of the Soviet people by the Nazis, it doesn't matter the heroic role at Stalingrad that probably saved the whole world. Those facts don't matter! Yeah, let's just show instead how the Russians were brutal and how the Russians forced and killed their own soldiers, because Communism is bad! Such an effort was made to highlight ""the Communist assassins"", ""forcing and killing their own soldiers"", that it becomes a ridiculous shame:1) First of all, this turns out to be historically FALSE. All records show that all Russians showed a tremendous will to fight, and they were not forced. Women, elders, crippled, everybody wanted to fight! There are German diary's telling how they were impressed by the Russian resistance, and numerous reports of heroic civilians. But NO, NO, NO. The Russians just won the war by throwing people in like meat.2) Second, Killing deserters? Where is the surprise of this Mr Director? Americans did it. Canadians did it. Frenchmen did it... Everybody did it, you know why? IT'S WAR! And we are talking about the most ferocious battle in the history of mankind! Oh, but I guess it is so easy to criticize acts like this when we are sited in a big comfortable Hollywood chair smoking a Cuban cigar ...And not only giving this false image about the Russians turned to be a big lie in this movie, but also the description of the battle. Let me explain this to you, Mr. Director ... This was the most atrocious, merciless human fighting ever. Still, you found time for a romance between a pretty boy and a pretty girl, for a hot shot Hollywood stardom for the main character, and in between some lovely chats with lovely families, inside some lovely Russian houses. In true Stalingrad, this just didn't happened. We are talking about a city in constant street to street fighting, both sides desperately trying to control every possible inch. We are talking about hunger, about sleeping half awake fearing a stab, about temperatures decreasing to -50 degrees, about constant ambushes, constant shooting. This movie doesn't show 20% of the true image of the battle.In conclusion: Mr Director: you may hate communism, you may hate Russians, OK, everybody has its own ideology. But you know what? Histoy is history. Distorting the truth is very, very serious, especially to the people of Russia, that have reasons to feel outraged by this. But hey, how am I surprised? After all,this is an American movie.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Visually stunning but overly sentimental,"I paid my money to go and see this movie, with the feeling that i was going to get a raw and savage account of the realism of Stalingrad.

I never really became involved in this movie, but saying that, i was never bored.  The combination of good acting and great special effects were well worth £4 of my well earned money.

Intriguing But Without A Past,"19 March 2001. While I really liked Enemy, I couldn't but wonder why for so much concentration on the main characters we never really found out much about their past and what made them do what they do. Overall the movie wasn't a ""Saving Private Ryan"" which in itself wasn't a bad thing. I particularly liked the interplay between Law and Harris and the low tech but high minded duel between the two. What would have been even better was a Russian produced film with a Russian script and Russian directed film. I came away from the film wondering if the portrayal in the movie was severely bias against today's America's so called ""enemy"". The movie was richly lavish, the context, texture, the patience all made the movie a delightful thriller and emotional package. Ed Harris came across real well both as a person and cold-bloodedness. The real debate here is who really was the better sniper? [3/30/08]: This movie really holds up well with repeating viewing and whether or not the past of these characters are revealed seems to be irrelevant to the real here and now, present concern about love, male competition. The fascinating interplay of two plot lines - the eventual sniper duel and the love triangle make for a balanced and intellectually, emotionally satisfying connection. The double-agent spy in the form of a little boy is even intriguing along with the eventual outcome of the boy's mother. There is epic mythology, media propaganda, the infamous Krushchev, inevitable Premier of Russia. This movie remains a strong 8/10 and even improves with age.",8.0,Anonymous,History

The only English accent I was really aware of was Sasha's. This was a wonderful and moving motion picture, and I was especially impressed with the acting of Jude Law and Joseph Fiennes.  I didn't  realize who the actors were, though they looked familiar.  They really became the characters, not themselves.  It's nice to see a new generation of young actors who can take on a variety of roles believably and not just be one type.

The beginning of the end for Nazi Germany,"By the time the allies landed at Normandy (June 1944) Nazi Germany was already defeated. On an almost constant retreat after the Battle of Stalingrad (Feb 1943)Germany's manpower losses at the Eastern Front were horrific. This movie gives a small example of what happened in the East. Good acting, great special effects (Stuka dive bombers that look like Stukas), and an interesting story make for a winner. Fortunately, I am well versed in the Eastern Front battles so the movie made sense to me.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Completely Inaccurate, Boring, Bad Rendition of Stalingrad","I always get mad at my teachers if they rant about how historically inaccurate a movie is or how inaccurate to the book it is. But this movie makes me see why. I rented this film after doing a project on Stalingrad. I was EXPECTING inaccuracies, but oh boy how inaccurate can you get. The beginning had a good set-up, a cool map rendition of Germany's gain. Then it had an opening with the hero learning to shoot wolves with a sniper, but somehow he was afraid to shoot them. Interesting idea, but later in the movie, he is all but eager to kill the Germans. EatG then moves to him going into Stalingrad. It then gets slow and boring, and although there are tense fight scenes, in between is just a bunch of fluff. Then they decide to add in a weak love plot, which ends up being the whole movie. The ONLY movie on Stalingrad, the bloodiest battle in world history, only focuses on a dumb LOVE PLOT! But the thing that really made me see how terrible it was was the slow realization when I finally saw: this is a movie about Russians, but the characters speak English as their regular language, and have British accents. WHAT THE HECK WAS GOING THROUGH WHOMEVER'S MIND WHEN THEY MADE THIS MOVIE! I thought this movie was gonna be good, but I was blown away with how BAD it was. Do not see this movie, even if you are a Stalingrad enthusiast you will only hate it more. Rent any other film instead, this is my least favorite movie of all time.",1.0,Anonymous,History
A shameful bowdlerization,"One is allowed some artistic license when making historical fiction, but this movie took an exciting true story and pressed it into the standard mold not just of Hollywood, but of social norms. Very often it chooses to make up a story rather than present the usually more interesting and exciting true account. Worse, it removed from the characters all those traits which didn't fit the version of history the writer wanted to tell.Let's start with the star, Zaitsev. He's portrayed as an uneducated solider with simple ways who learned to shoot as a boy. This allows him to be a moral contrast with the cynical and educated Commisar Danilov. This is the relationship the writer wanted, the common man does good versus the cynical politico.In fact, Zaitsev was an navy clerk before the war and a Sergent Major. He would have known how to read and write and would not have been shoved forward without a rifle in a suicide attack.Tania Chernova's character (Rachel Weisz) is the most bowdlerized. While Chernova was Zaitsev's student and lover, she was also a sniper of great skill with an incredible will to survive. She had a burning anger against the Germans and referred to her targets as ""sticks"" which she would ""break"". Her stories are interesting and daring as Zaitsev's own. Her introduction to Stalingrad is both true and as exciting as the one the movie makes up for Zaitsev. It is a great tragedy that she is reduced to nothing but a love interest of Zaitsev's.Stripping down Chernova's real character makes room for the largely made up Commisar Danilov. It allows Zaitsev, Chernova and Danilov to fit the conventional roles of ""male hero"", ""female lover"" and ""male anti-hero"".It is sad to see Hollywood take exciting, true history featuring strong male and female characters and change it into a comfortable lie. A lie about the goodly male hero who takes power from his innocence, his female lover, and their friend who is cynical and troubled because of his over-education and ambition. The standard Hollywood tropes: ignorance is strength, women are weak, too much education makes you go bad.For a much better account of the Battle of Stalingrad, please instead read William Craig's ""Enemy Of The Gates"" from which this movie takes it's title but from which it takes very little history.",,Anonymous,History
Through the Gates of a great Movie Through the Gates for a great Through the Gates for a great Through the Gates for a great,"Enemy at the Gates was AWESOME!!!! This weekend after my long over due shave, I ran to the 9:45 showing of Enemy at the Gate and, from the credits on I was blown away. I'm convinced that this movie was made by someone who not only is a very sensitive artist but a gifted filmmaker, no hack could ever pull this film off, is impossible. This film not only has a very specific opinion about war, but about the ties made and responsibilities taken. My first impression of the movie, and those of you who saw it I'm talking about the boat scene, it was going to be a plain testosterone ride but, I was way wrong. This movie hates war, hates war just as much as the Nazis, the Russians and just the whole thing, that's why is great and remarkable. All the characters have a sense off responsibilities but at the same time an even bigger sense of doom, after all they are in the middle of a war, and as stated it's the worst place to be. The fact that is by all means a ""sniper movie"" the characters were not what you would see through the view finder of a rifle, the are well crafted individuals who want to not only help the Motherland but get themselves out of this situation. Every character has it's remorse and dreams even if they are not stated they are there, not underwritten, just written by the acting, which is to say the least, superb. Every single shot fired was frightening to me, not only because of the moral consequences but because of the toll it was taken on the characters, for every Nazi a Russian will die. And now to the part I loved the most, in the middle of the awful war of guns, a love story brews. The great thing about the love story is that him and her were in love with the situation not the person. She was in love with the legend that he was and he was just in love with the pretty girl who likes the man everyone thinks he is, perfection. During the sex scene everyone in the theater was laughing. I know why, when you watch that scene without thinking about what i just stated the sex may seem impossible, why would they fall in love with each other you just met 30 minutes ago, well is simple escapism. They are escaping the war by running into each other. And off course the twist that makes the love story complete is that the man who truly knows her and the way she is, his love is not returned. Sad but the base for a great story, where the biggest conflict is surviving this war. Without a doubt, in my top list of greatest war films ever,  also in the list Full Metal Jacket, Paths of Glory, Bridge on the River Kwai.I saw other movies this week end but fact is I don't remember them. Not only is it one of the best of the years but one of the best crafted films since Eyes Wide Shut.  It was a great way to start the weekend.Lo",10.0,Anonymous,History

A Job Well Done,"I thought that this film was very well done.  It was historically inaccurate and I agree with some critics that the American and British accents didn't mix very well with the film, I still thought ""Enemy at the Gates"" was pretty good.  I liked the setting of the battle scenes, such as the Crossing of the Volga River.  I liked the story line, a sniper duel between the Russian Vasily Zaitsev and the German Major Koenig.  I didn't like the love triangle part, it slowed down the film.  From actual history, Vasily did fall in love with Tania, but there was no love triangle.  All in all, it was a good film.",10.0,Anonymous,History

The Best War Film that actually has a Meaning,"Enemy at the gates is the perfect way to describe a good to honest movie. Its been a while since a war film has been released worth seeing, but it has just broken the silence. While the movie follows the war and the one battle as Nazi Germany charge into Russia it follows the story of 1 soldier and his own personal struggles. (sounding Feminine ) Don't worry, there is plenty of gore as the battle rages on between the two snipers, Harris and Law.

"Good action, ok acting, bad music","The story is entertaining enough and will keep you interested for the duration of the movie. The sometimes poor acting (by the woman) will sometimes throw you out of the moment with overly-dramatic acting.
Action-scenes are good and the sniper scenes are compelling.
The very odd and probably unique music for this movie is just used way too much with the stupid du-du-duu-duuuuuuuuuu sound appearing every 5 minutes, making this movies soundtrack mock the entire movie.The age of the film is reflected in scenes including blood and special-effects, and the audio have tendencies to go beyond the frequencies of the audio recording equipmentOverall

Krushev with a British Accent,"This film reminds me of John Mackenzie's ""The Fourth Protocol"" where we have good English actors who are portraying Russian people, speaking with a British accent (In scenes that are allegedly taking place in Russia).Not that it matters that much, especially in this film: But I do think that an actor like Bob Hoskins would have been able to pull off a Nikita Krushev, especially after all of the characters he has made us believe in the last 25 years.I have the same problems with Ed Harris, not that he was not the perfect actor to portray the German Sniper: He is just so... American.Nevertheless, if you ignore these little irritants, this is a great film, apparently a true story pulled out of a huge book about Russia in WW II: but expanded and dramatized.Jude Law looks as good as any other character part he has taken, whether it is Lemony Snicket, Sky Captain, Joe from AI, or, my favourite, Errol Flynn in The Aviator. This role just adds more to his already huge repertoire of characterizations.The cast of this film is just marvelous, a part for just about all of my favourite character actors. Add to that the set that was built for this little drama to be enacted out on.I like films where details are believable, aka, honest films. Well, the details that Jean-Jacques Annaud decided to show us are in fact the details that are important. It would just have been my personal taste to have the accents done according to country at least, but in retrospect, it did not take away from my enjoyment of the film.",10.0,Anonymous,History
War of the rats in crumbling Stalingrad during WWII,"RELEASED IN 2001 and directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud , ""Enemy at the Gates"" takes place in the last four months of 1942 during the pivotal Battle of Stalingrad. Russian troops are carted in by the literal trainloads as the Germans attack/bomb the city. Once the dust clears the situation settles into a more personal battle of sharpshooting wills. A lowly young Russian soldier named Vassili (Jude Law) distinguishes himself for his shooting skills and is promoted as a national hero to motivate the Russian cause. After numerous German officers are assassinated, Major König (Ed Harris), the top German sniper, is assigned to seek out and eliminate Vassili.Most WWII films take place on the Western Front whereas ""Enemy"" is one of only two mainline films I can think of that address the Eastern front, the other being Sam Peckinpah's underrated ""Cross of Iron"" (1977).Three things stuck in my mind after seeing ""Enemy at the Gates"" years ago: (1.) The opening sequence where the Russian troops are boated across the Volga to join the fight is extremely harrowing, not far removed from the opening D-Day invasion in ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998), but different. ""Enemy"" is worth viewing for this sequence alone. (2.) The city-in-rubble sets with bodies strewn everywhere had a lasting impression on me as did the scurrying-like-rats-through-the-rubble warfare. (3.) Some may find this weird, but I always remembered the discreet lovemaking scene while the soldiers lain in the rubble trying to sleep. I'm not sure why this left an impression, maybe because it struck me as so real: Men & women would be drawn to one another and mate even in the worst possible scenarios.The film was based on the book ""War of the Rats"" by David L. Robbins and thus intentionally provokes the imagery of human rats scurrying through the debris. The cast also includes Joseph Fiennes as the political officer who elevates Vassili to hero status via his pamphlets and articles, while Rachel Weisz plays the romantic interest between the two. Ron Perlman is also on hand in a limited role as Vassili's sharpshooting comrade.As with any film based on historical events there are facts-obsessed critics who decry the lack of authenticity in this or that detail (e.g. ""The zippers on the trousers aren't right, blasphemy!!""), but ""Enemy"" gets the gist correct and, besides, it motivates the viewer to research the actual Battle of Stalingrad. What more can you ask for?The fact is Vassili had 260 verified Nazi kills and played a key role in motivating the Russians to victory in the Battle of Stalingrad, the largest and bloodiest battle in the history of warfare (with roughly 2 million killed, wounded or captured). The movie effectively shows how the Russian combatants weren't necessarily professionally trained soldiers; many of them were peasants, workers, teachers, mailmen, farmers, etc. They knew they could die the next morning hence they celebrated (and made love) while they could. Stalingrad was one of the major turning points of World War II; from then on it was all downhill for Germany.FINAL WORD: ""Enemy at the Gates"" details an oft-ignored important aspect of WWII, the Eastern front. It has several memorable scenes, especially the opening crossing of the Volga and also a clever sequence involving a large shard of reflective glass.THE FILM RUNS 2 hours, 11 minutes and was shot entirely in Germany (Brandenburg and Bavaria).GRADE: B+",7.0,Anonymous,History
Two hours of my life I'll never get back,"This movie totally failed to engage me. The director (Jean Jacques Annaud) got himself into a confused mess when trying to make this good versus evil movie - he's comfortable depicting all Nazis as bad but he can't depict all Soviets as good and tries instead to portray a complex grey area. Unfortunately, he fails. The two characters who are battling it out (Jude Law and Ed Harris) raised no empathy with me and about halfway through the movie I realised I actually didn't care which one won provided one of them did and I could leave. The movie is also full of cliches (a love triangle, a young boy, a cold-eyed enemy, supporting characters early deaths - some of which you'll be grateful for!) and this does nothing to increase the enjoyment. Men might want to see this for Rachel Weisz as the beautiful young soldier girl and women will inevitably want to see Jude Law but find them in other films and maybe you'll be treated to a plot which you can enjoy. The only good thing about the movie is Bob Hoskins - and if that isn't a sentence to scare the living daylights out of you then you deserve this movie!",3.0,Anonymous,History
Not as good as Saving Private Ryan...,"but it is still a fairly good film.  The war scenes, especially the beginning, were well done and even scary.  The Russian soldiers were forced to run to their death.  It was basically suicide.  The acting was good, but I had a problem with Jude Law because he just looked to hot to be some starving soldier living in filth.  Even with dirt on his face, he still looked like he stepped off a GQ cover.  Ed Harris was my favorite character in this. I liked how his character was always calm and cool although he did something stupid at the end.I had a problem with the newspaper and signs being written in Russian. They speak English throughout the film.  And Joseph Fiennes' character dictates his stories in English and spells in English, so why on earth was the newspaper shown written in Russian.  Also, you have to overlook the fact that the main characters have a British accent.I also felt the love story thrown in weakened the main plot of the film. This movie was about 2 snipers in a cat and mouse game.  That is one reason SPR was better because it didn't have some sappy love story in the middle of the film.FINAL VERDICT:  One of the better war movies, but it does have some flaws. Worth a viewing if you are into war movies or Jude Law.",,Anonymous,History
A very good flick,"This is a really awesome war flick. Which I think has a rather interesting focus in it. I mean to focus on a sniper guy what is being hunted by an German sniper is a dangerous move to do, its real easy to get it all just being dumb. But the director manages to keep the movie in line and interesting at all time.There is really only one major thing I dislike with this film and that is the fact that both the German side and the Russian side is very very good in talking English. Its very sad that Hollywood flicks mostly has this all out-good cast of English talking actors.that is the reason I lower the rate for this film. It would have been more interesting to see it if Germans spoked German and Russian side spoked Russian.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Great War Movie,"This is one of my favorite all time War movies in general, maybe because it's different two snipers vs each other is the main point to the whole movie,, yes there is a love interest in the movie and probably could have done without it,, but hey other than that.. you have Ed Harris as the Major, who is sent out by the Fuhrer himself to eliminate the top Russian Marksman,, Vasily Zietzsev. Jude Law was excellent i thought as the Russian Hero.. his love interest is Rachel Weisz who is cute and nice to look at it, but a war is the wrong place for a love story,, the two characters play cat and mouse practically the whole movie,, the scenes of the Luftwaffe when they attack on the Volga River are totally awesome i thought,, the special effect,, bullets flying,, everything was realistic i thought, the movie is very tense and well put together,, the struggle for Stalingrad in the Fall / Winter of 1942 early 1943. Stallingrad gets overrun by German's and the villagers left to survive help Zietzev in his quest for fame by trying to eliminate the German Major,, Harris doesn't appear till the 34 min. mark but is very effective all the way to the ending of the movie. There is some treachery, and backstabbing,, going on in the movie,, some people that you thought you could trust,, you can't,, i liked Bob Hoskins character prob the most, as Nikita Krushchev,, what a riot he was,, so all things considered this is a great movie,, not really to be missed at all.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Better than average-Yet So Much Wasted Potential,"It made headlines. It made bucks. (The real measure of success, I suppose for Hollywood poobahs). ENEMY AT THE GATES made for an interesting story, but only so long as the film stayed running. It could have been memorable, but it just turned out to be another night at the movies. What a shame.The six month siege of Stalingrad was historically such a horrendous conflagration, one could understand the producers wanting to keep the scope small in perspective. Yet, the many aspects of suffering by its citizenry was overlooked. One never got the feel or sense of suffering, of the inhabitants. The thousands who perished, not from German bullets or bombs, but simply starvation. This is never explored. The refugees or people who tried to leave the city, en masse. From this film's very limited point of view, Stalingrad is empty, except for Ed and Jude, and company.The performances were earnest and above average, except for Bob Hoskin' s Nikita Kruschev. The normally superb Hoskins played Kruschev poorly, i.e. an utter boob. It was hard to stifle a laugh. ""...Lose yourself!"" indeed. Ed Harris steals the show, as the aristocratic Major Konig, just by the subtlety of his performance. Three quarters through the movie, unfortunately, he jumps into hyper-nasty German mode (a characterization seen in zillions of movies) and the cliche plays out. I'm surprised he didn't stop into a bomb shelter to mow down a thousand babushkas, before meeting up for his final showdown with Vassili. Any personal sense of honor the character possessed went out the window, to prop up a cliche.If one is looking for a serious sense of a historical event, skip this one. Try STALINGRAD, a German movie about this event (see prior review), which might bring the overall horror of Stalingrad into view. ENEMY AT THE GATE, while above average and recommended, came off more like HIGH NOON without the horses.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Not a documentary.,"One of my top ten war movies; it shares the experience of Stalingrad without being letter-perfect historically. The depiction is horrifying, the reality was much worse. Yes, Krushchev was there, was handing out rifles, and was a commander/party aparatchik in the city. His likeness on Bob Hoskins blew me away. Tanks rolled out of the factory, unpainted and with no sights and entered the battle only blocks away. The carnage was unmatched in the history of warfare, perhaps exceeded only by Verdun which was actually shorter. Only about 5000 Germans survived from the 6th German Army when they were sent back to Germany in 1955. This was a turning point in the Eastern front, the War and the History of the World.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Some are missing important aspects of the movie...,"I have come across those who do not like the sex scene between Vasilli and Tania.  It fits in very nicely with the flow of the movie. To begin, we have to contrast how poorly the ordinary soldiers were armed, compared with those behind them.  After all, Soviet soldiers died because they were purposely shot by those who thought better.  In my observation, this is a misplacing of priority.  The instinct not to lose was more important than the instinct to win.  To say there is no difference is misguided. Then what about the concern Danilov had towards Tania.  He wanted to make sure that she survived, but he made sure that Vasilli was placed in the most precarious position ever since he arrived.  He knew it, Tania knew it, and Vasilli knew it.  So, if a man is sent to what could be his death, it doesn't take much to celebrate life in any form. However at the end, the movie does take a hopeful turn.  Not the reuniting of Vasilli and Tania, but the realization by Danilov just before he died that regardless of the rules; there is always something that causes one to envy another. That in itself only goes so far, and I would say in the end, Danilov learned the lesson that it is not enough to know the difference between good and evil; one needs to do what is good, and not do what is evil.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Oh hell no!!! NO NO NO!!!,"I am a big fan of war movies. Especially world war II (obviously being from Russia). Let me say that Hollywood had done a great job on making WWII movies that relate to America. Congratulations to Spielberg on Saving Private Ryan, also great job Micheal Bay on Pearl Harbor. Tora Tora Tora, Midway, Ike, Tobruk, Empire of the Sun, etc. Those were all great movies. However, those were all Anglo-American battles. Lets move into the Russian front. Lets focus on Stalingrad, the biggest battle in human history to date. A battle that was fought between the two most powerful countries in the world (Germany and Russia), with the two biggest tyrants in the world (Hitler and Stalin), and with some of the finest weapons in the world. What does Hollywood do? They sh*t on it. First let me correct some historical accuracies: 1. Most of the crossing of the volga happened at night.2. In 1941, when the Germans first invaded, the red army did resort to one man having the rifle, and the other having the bullets. However by 1942, the industry in the Soviet Union rose so rapidly, that the soldiers were armed to the bone.3.The Germans spoke German, and the Russians spoke Russian. Neither of them spoke English.4. Nikita Khrushchev was nowhere near the battle. Marshal Georgi Zhukov, and General Vasili Chuikov were in charge of the battle, and in the end, Chuikov led the 62nd army to victory.5. There were no communist propaganda posters. There were war posters, urging victory.6. A ten year old kid would never run around in shorts in -40 temperatures.I could go on forever about the inaccuracies. Someone with no knowledge of history outside their country wrote the script for this. I guarantee that there is not a single Russian in the credits. As for the story of Vasili Zaitsev. He really was the best sniper in Russia at the time. He was leading a sniper school in the battle. His little sniper band was called the Hares (Zaitsev means Hare in Russian). There was more than one German supersniper sent after him, and they were all killed. The whole child spy story was a load of crap. The love story was completely unnecessary. I think the movie focused more on the love story than the actual dual. At least the love story in Peal Harbor was interesting, this one was complete schlock. Overall don't waste your money. Americans are good at making American war movies. If you want to see a movie about the Russian side of the war, look for the movie Osvobozhdenie (Liberation). Its hard to find, but its worth it. If you want to see a movie on the German side, look for Der Untergang (Downfall). Ignore this heap of garbage. My family fought in this war, and my great grandfather was in Stalingrad. This movie is a disgrace to him, to my family, and to the 22 million men who died defending Russia from the Nazi monsters.",1.0,Anonymous,History
incredible performances and great writing,"After watching such films as ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Patton;"" I have come to appreciate war films. For this reason, I decided to see the latest war film, ""Enemy At The Gates.""""Enemy At The Gates"" is one of the best war films I have seen since ""Saving Private Ryan"" because it is executed perfectly. With incredible performances, script and the impact I felt; ""Enemy At The Gates"" sets the tone as the first great war film of the 22nd century. This film can be served as the appetizer to the main course coming out soon, ""Pearl Harbor.""Jude Law, Joseph Feinnes, Rachel Weisz, Ed Harris and Bob Hoskins come together to re-visit the Battle of Stalingrad in 1942. The best thing about seeing each one of the actors perform was they all gave 100 percent effort to make the film as real as possible; they did an excellent job. Fiennes, Weisz and Hoskins were the icing to a cake that was delicious from the start.The highlights of ""Enemy At The Gates"" always came when Law and Harris were on screen because they played excellent psychological mind games with one another to win; furthermore, it was like watching master chess players playing for the grand prize. It was also enjoyable to see the strategies and tactics each would use to out-maneuver the other.""Enemy At The Gates"" drew me with its many action sequences similar to those in ""Saving Priate Ryan."" Also, the love triangle between the three main leads was interesting to watch and see how it would unfold. I felt like I was in the movie because the writer did an excellent job at making me feel exactly what they felt and experience what they were going through.There is no rule that states dialogue is needed for a successful film. While ""Enemy At The Gates"" has dialogue, the scenes that have none stand out in my mind the most because we see close-ups of both snipers and the expressions on their faces. This is incredible to me because the intensity shown on their faces speaks volumes about what the movie is really about.This is not be the best war film ever made but with two of the brightest young stars on the rise, an actress that is here to stay and a veteran that continues to turn in knock-out performances, ""Enemy At The Gates"" will be remembered for a long time.",,Anonymous,History
Excellent Film with a unique perspective,"I thought this film was great. The fact that it is actually the perspective of the war from two different countries other than the U.S. Learning of the horrors of Stalingrad in school as well as the huge casualty counts, I could never grasp how bad it really was until I watched this film. You are blown away from the very beginning of the film. It has many touching moments that will make you shiver and maybe even glad to not be a Russian soldier during the Nazi invasion.The only reason I didn't give this movie all 10 stars is because of the accents. I felt they should have dished out the extra cash to train the actors to get Russian and Germans accents, at least somewhat. Jude Law's British accent doesn't go unnoticed and Ed Harris sounds as American as anyone. Other than that...this film rocked...simply said.

My (Jewish) father's 9-year old memories of evacuation from Kiev in one of those cars you can see in ""Enemy at the Gates"", being separated from his mother on the way (she stayed in one of the train stops to bury her infant son who didn't survive evacuation).I can't take War stories just as ""stories"".

""Enemy at the Gates"" from the first scenes struck me as very true to what I heard from my mother and father, what I've seen in Stalingrad' museums when I visited the city as a child.I'm really surprised by tepid reviews this movie received. Some say it's not deep enough, others say that the romantic part of it could be left out. May be it's not very deep, but it's true. The ""meat grinder"" scenes, Soviet officers killing unarmed ""cowards"" who showed their backs to the enemy, ""creation"" of a hero, and love and lovemaking amidst it all: it's all true and it did happen. Somehow it's important to me that people know and remember it all. I have this stupid hope that if people know and remember, they will not let it happen again.Obviously this is a very personal and emotional view. Watching a desperate half-armed attack of Soviet troops, I whispered to my husband ""This is how your and my grandfathers were killed"". Of course we'll never know if they were killed by German bullets. This film is very important to ME, because I BELIEVE that knowing my homeland history is important. Watch this movie if knowing true history is important to you. Skip it if you are fishing for entertainment, or for very deep lessons about life, or for deep and interesting character development. I'm not sure how deep comrade Zaitsev was. Maybe he was a common person put in very uncommon circumstances.I give this movie 10 for truthfulness. In this particular case everything else is less important to me.",10.0,Anonymous,History
I loved it.,"This is a war movie with a different twist.It is not so much about the war,but instead about the battle between two snipers.In the role as the two snipers you will find Jude Law and Ed Harris and they both do an excellent job. Actually all characters were great, and the fact that the movie is based on a true story just make it even better. The movie takes place in Stalingrad under the second world war and the scenes is very detailed and gives you the feeling of being there. The whole movie has a dark atmosphere and gives you this creepy feeling, because you dont know what is happening next.You can also expect a lot of intense moments,especially some shooting scenes. Remember that this is not your ordinary war movie and I promise you that you will be happy that you saw it.A really cool war movie.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Good entertaining stuff.,"As a history of the conflict in Stalingrad this isn't up to much, it sticks to an anti-communist line portraying the Russians as unwilling to fight the Germans and having to be threatened or tricked into doing so and there is an annoying little speech at the end about how communism was a bad idea and couldn't work.I don't watch war movies for the history, very few are accurate and most take sides and push political agendas, I watch them for the entertainment and this is good entertainment.The actors deliver good performances although Law doesn't have a lot of acting to do, it is Fiennes who gets most of the dialogue and supporting characters also deliver good solid performances.The direction is good, it gives sweeping views of the various scenes and doesn't fall back on gore or jerky close ups.The pace is quick with lots of mini battles and a few close escapes.The romantic triangle is largely irrelevant and seems forced but it doesn't hurt the film.There is very little new here though, the dialogue is uninteresting and the action is fairly standard stuff.There are a few surprises in the plot and the ending is good with a few dark twists added in to tie things up.This is a light weight war film, worth watching but nothing to get excited about.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Prostitute at the Gates,"GETTING RIGHT TO IT.  If you're going to take the time to make an epic war movie, don't throw a love story into it.  Scenes were completely drawn out, particularly a sex scene that had my friends and I looking at each other thinking ""when is this going to end.""

Harrowing,This is not a pleasant film to watch but it's excellent. It shows the Battle of Stalingrad exactly as it was. Reading Anthony Beevor's book on Stalingrad prompted me to watch this film plus the fact that I have always been interested in Russia. Bob Hoskins must have studied films of Khrushchev from the time he was Soviet premier. The scene where Khrushchev embraces Vasili Zaitsev looks remarkably like the newsreel of the real Khrushchev embracing Yuri Gagarin after his space flight. Enemy at the Gates contrasts with Saving Private Ryan. Saving Private Ryan is about democracy fighting totalitarianism. Enemy at the Gates is about the clash between two merciless totalitarian systems. Rachel Weisz is spot on casting as Tanya. She's a very talented actress and she's got the right kind of slavic appearance.,,Anonymous,History

"Decent movie, but there were few surprises.","""Enemy at the Gates"" was certainly worth seeing, but I was disappointed to find that with a couple of exceptions, it was mostly a pretty standard war movie.  Like another reviewer here, the opening scene on the banks of the Volga nearly had me in tears questioning what could possibly motivate human beings to hurl so much misery at one another.  After the opening, though, the movie isn't particularly gut-wrenching.  The appearance of Hoskins' character was a surprise to me.  I had previously seen that Hoskins would be in the movie, but I didn't know who he'd be playing or that Nikita Khruschev would be a part of this story.  I must say that the use of English didn't bother me in the least, nor was I concerned that the actors used their own accents.  I very much prefer that to having them try to sound like a Russian speaking English, as a friend of mine put it.  Someone commented that Jude Law's accent sounded upper-crust, but it struck me as sounding more like a common or rural British accent, slightly different than what he normally employs.  I also agree with some other reviewers that it was a nice change to see a World War II movie told from a non-American perspective.  The only other examples that I can think of off the top of my head are ""Das Boot"" and ""Grave of the Fireflies.""  I enjoyed ""Enemy"" overall and I'm glad I saw it, but if you don't get around to catching it, don't lose sleep over it.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"An Excellent ""True Hero"" Movie","I absolutely loved this movie!! The cast was great and everyone perfectly fitted into their roles especially the main characters. I have seen many war movies but no movie has ever made me feel that I wanted to go out and get the bad guy(in this case the German sniper Major Konig). This movie has it all: love, loss, suspense, action, and betrayal. The story line is one that quickly draws the viewer into the world of battle, the battle for Stalingrad and the personal struggles the characters faced. It most strongly illustrated how one man in this case Vassili Zeitsev (Jude Law) could change the fate of his country and how he alone could give hope to those who had none. Vassili was not the only hero, there was Tania(Rachel Weisz),Danilov(Joseph Fiennes),Koulikov(Ron Perlman) and others. These heros had wove a fine web of dependence upon each other to stay strong, stay alive and to face the enemy. This movie definitely defines what a true hero is.",10.0,Anonymous,History
If we lose the city the entire nation will collapse,"(There are some Spoilers) True story of a Russian shepherd boy who's biggest ambition in life was to become a foreman, in a Soviet industrial factory, instead ending up becoming a Hero of the Soviet Union by picking off almost 150 German troops with his trusty snipers rifle in the battle scared factory district during the battle of Stalingrad.With the German advance steamrolling into the USSR in the spring and summer of 1942 by early September the only obstacle that stood in the way of a Nazi victory in Russia, and eventually winning the Second World War altogether, was the highly industrial city on the River Volga ironically named after the then dictator, Joseph Stalin, of the Soviet Union Stalingrad.The German superiority in armor and air-power was counterbalanced not only by the Red Army's brutal tactics against their own troops killing many Russian soldiers, by rearguard NKVD execution squads, who tried to surrender to the German forces or retreat from the front-lines. Also the street fighting skills of Gen. Chikov's 62nd Army that did the brunt of the fighting and dying in the defense of the city.Early in the fighting young Red Army private Vassili Zaitsev, Jude Law, trapped in no-mans land picked off five German soldiers in ten minutes to the admiration of his fellow, and disabled, Red Army comrade Danilov, Joseph Flennes. Danilov get's this idea of lifting the Red Army's sagging moral in the fighting by making Vassili a national hero in publishing his sniping exploits in the Red Army's newspaper. Keeping a daily score of his kills on the front page.The Soviet political commissar of Stalingrad Nikita Krushchev, Bob Hoskins, is more then delighted with both Danilov idea and Vassili's exploits promoting both of them. Danilov to a commissar post and Vassili to the head of an elite Soviet sniper company. As Vassili's daily kills raise the Red Army's hopes and moral in Stalingrad the German's get their ace sniper Major Konig, Ed Harris, to get into a killing contest with Vassili. With the eventual winner being the one who knocks off the opposing champion, Vassili or Konig, first.The great battle scenes in the movie are offset by a fictitious and schmaltzy love triangle between the two friends Vassili and Danilov with pretty Jewish Red Army woman soldier Tani Chernova, Rachel Weisz. There's also a underlying racial element in this tri-love affair with Danilov who's himself Jewish resenting that his good friend and army comrade Vassili, who saved his life, having an affair with a Jewish woman.Konig getting to Stalingrad for the big showdown starts to pick off Red Army soldiers with the same ease and skill as Vassili does against the Germans. It's only a matter of time before the two square off against each other but the fact that now Tani is the mix things get a lot more complicated. Danilov want's to have Tani transfered away from the front not only to keep her from getting killed but away from her lover Vassili. This underhanded action on Danilov's part leads the former Ural shepherd boy to lose his concentration and almost get picked off by the far less worried, about his love life, Major Konig.There's also little 8 year old Sacha Filipov, Gabriel Thomson, who's spying for the Red Army in order to get important information on Major Konigs whereabouts so that his hero Vassili can get the drop on him. Major Konig who pays off little Sacha with bars of chocolates and hunks of bacon, what a weird combination, for his services knows what he's really up to, a double-agent for the Russians. Major Konig gives Sacha a chance to escape but thinking that the German Major is being fooled by his charade Sacha tragically ends up being captured and hanged by a very reluctant but iron-Prussian willed Konig.With the city looking like it's on the verge of falling to the Germans the remaining population is evacuated across the Volga which includes Sacha's mother, and Tina good friend, Mrs. Filipou ,Eva Matters. Mrs. Filipou is told by Danilov that her son deserted to the other side to keep her from knowing the truth that he was executed by the Nazis. During the evacuation Tina gets hit by a German artillery shell and, being so badly wounded, is then thought to have been killed. This leads Danilov ,in a last gesture of friendship, towards Vassili,to exposed himself getting hit right between the eyes by Konig which leads him to come out in the open and into the gun-sight of Vassili Zaitsev's snipers rifle. it's later revealed that Tina survived her wounds making Danilov act of self-sacrifice even more telling that it already was.P.S Vassili Zaitsev's career as a Red Army sniper came to a sudden end in early 1943 when he was badly injured by a German land mine. Vassili lost what's the most important attribute that a sniper needs to do his deadly work his sight. Being awarded Hero of the Soviet Union by Comrade Stalin Vassili is looked upon today some 60 years after WWII as one of the greatest fighting men in Russian, Soviet or otherwise, history. Vassili's snipers rifle is on display in the Stalingrad War Museum in Volgagrad named after the river that it's on not the WWII Soviet dictator who was responsible, in safe and far off Moscow, for it's heroic defense.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Exciting Realistic Battle Scenes,"""Enemy at the Gates"" is a WWII drama that takes place during the German siege of Stalingrad in 1942. Director Jean-Jacques Annaud stages realistic and convincing battle scenes amid the ruins of a great city. The scenes where the peasant soldiers are forced into a suicidal battle with few arms is particularly gruesome and unforgettable.From the ranks of the peasant soldiers comes a deadly sharpshooter named Vassili,(Jude Law) who through a fateful encounter meets an influential Russian information officer, Danilov (Joseph Fiennes)who in turn brings his particular talents to the attention of Nikita Khrushchev (Bob Hoskins). Vassili is then developed into a national hero for his exploits as a propaganda measure to improve the morale of the Russian people. The Germans counter with their own sharpshooter Major Konig (Ed Harris) who is sent in to take out Vassili.The rest of the movie is essentially a cat and mouse game between Law and Harris. A totally unnecessary love triangle develops between Vasilli, Danilov and Tania (Rachel Weisz). Law and Weisz give us a graphic demonstration of ""love among the ruins"" along the way.Law conveys too much baby-faced innocence to be convincing as a cold-blooded assassin. Harris, on the other hand, is thoroughly believable in his role. He unfortunately has to perform the requisite evil German act near the end of the story, which I thought was totally unnecessary for his character within the context of the story. Fiennes is good as the ambitious Danilov but Weisz is not believable as a female scholar/sharpshooter. Hoskins does a nice turn as the overbearing Khrushchev. Ron Perlman has a brief bit as Koulikov another Russian sharpshooter.""Enemy at the Gates"" is good war movie. The conflict between the Law and Harris characters is riveting. But the movie suffers with the love story and the contrived ""happily ever after"" Hollywood ending.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"Great, great, great, but then...","Gripping realism.  The magic of cinema is it's ability to transport you to the story's setting, to the point where you believe you are there. ""Enemy at the Gates"" did that.  The living hell of war is mercilessly thrown upon you, and you can no more escape it than the characters in the film. Great story; well, of course, because it's based on a true story.  Great historical accuracy, great acting, great cinematography.  A great testament to this film is that the most memorable, gripping moments are not the ones featuring mass destruction, humongous explosions and bodies flying hither & yon. No, it's the waiting.  It's experiencing what sharpshooters endure to execute their missions.  Endless hours remaining motionless; playing dead among the actual dead.  The chess game played with human pieces. If you see this movie, note also the beautiful symbolism of Ed Harris as the wolf from childhood.  (Crystal blue eyes, silent patience before pouncing, etc.) This is what I found riveting.BUT THEN...LIKE THE ENOLA GAY BEFORE IT, Hollywood had to drop this pointless, intrusive, formulaic, prerequisite love story BOMB right in the middle of a fantastic war story.  I didn't know lipstick was so readily available in war-torn Stalingrad.  And Rachel somehow managed to find the cleanest sewer pipes & trenches to crawl through. COME ON, HOLLYWOOD!  Remember ""Kelly's Heroes""?  There weren't even any women IN it.  See also ""Bridge on the River Kwai"", ""Dirty Dozen, The"" & ""Magnificent Seven, The"".Thank God these classics were made before this drivel was required in every American made film.  Can you just imagine ""Kelly's Heroes"" being remade today?  I couldn't conceive the horror of seeing Freddie Prinze Jr. as Kelly, finding the gold and then leaving it behind as he realizes that the love of the beautiful Italian maiden (played by Kirsten Dunst in a black wig) is worth more than 60 million dollars.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Massive failure,"There are so many things that went wrong in this movie that treating them all in paragraph form would probably exceed the one thousand word limit imposed by the Database.  I do believe, however, that all the problems can be wrapped under the single title ""Mood.""What is wrong with the mood in Enemy At the Gates?  Everything.  Let's start simply: music.  Despite a reasonably solid history, James Horner embarrasses himself.  For his sake, I can only hope that Arnaud can be blamed for this, and not Horner (I enjoyed his work in Legends of the Fall.)  The music is constantly ""Mickey Mouseing"" the action on the scene; that is, in case the viewer is too dumb to understand what's happening visually, the music clues him in.  When we first encounter Ed Harris, the music keys up an evil score -- in case we had thought these were the Good Nazis.  When trouble seems to be brewing, the music mimics it.  This is not necessarily a cardinal sin. Most movies, to some extent, use music in this fashion.  But when it is as invasive as the music of GATES, it deserves a demerit.Accents.  I had several discussions about this before seeing the film, defending GATES on the basis that ""Russians don't sound accented to each other when they're speaking, so there's no reason to accent a supposedly all-Russian army.  Unfortunately, the director (Arnaud) made some grievous errors with the accents.  First of all, within a country as large as the USSR, regional dialects are pervasive.  However, the only ""regional accents"" we hear are US or British accents.  Which means that Jude Law -- supposedly an uneducated peasant -- speaks with his usual British flair.  Secondly, Arnaud at times seems to forget that the Germans are speaking German and the Soviets Russian.  As a result, Ed Harris can easily converse with a Russian boy with no linguistic problems (is the message that a German nobleman learned Russian, or that the boy knew German?  I do not know.)  All in all, it's another invasive element.Stalingrad.  It certainly looks pretty enough (or, impressively destroyed), though Aranaud spends an inordinate amount of time showing us a symbolic statue of Stalin (it seems that not just American directors are obsessed over Russias old cast-iron statues.)  Yet geographically, we start to run into problems.  Any character can find any other character within a matter of minutes -- despite the fact that the city is a warzone, rubble-strewn, and gigantic.  It's simply strange, and more than slightly silly.  My friends and I were laughing constantly by the end when Arnaud's harsh cuts (which would often show dramatic lighting changes within a single scene) would teleport Law from the Volga to the front and back again before breakfast was done.We see one civilian (excluding a rushed evacuation scene) the entire movie. We never get ANY notion that this is a populous city that is being annihilated.  In fact, the closest thing we get is a cliche, ""This is my home"" (with Horner playing it up for us, of course)...the woman saying that evacuates within two minutes.  No one else ever mentions anything.The love story.  Jesus H. Christ.  The one provoked fits of laughter -- especially from the girls in our group.  One excellent scene has Jude Law and Racquel Weisz engaged in intercourse, in a tunnel, surrounded by 30 sleeping soldiers on all sides.  Aside from the fact that Weisz achieves multiple orgasms this way (or so her ludicrous acting would suggest), she seems to really enjoy having Law's filthy, filthy hands rubbed over her face and lips.  As I said, laughable.  Much like the friendship between Fiennes and Law, the romance between the three seems based on convenience.  Fiennes and Law become fast friends because they are using each other for fame (isn't that the truest form of friendship?), and Weisz has two fans because she's attractive and extremely sexually liberated.  There is certainly no suggestion -- except in the apparent expectation on the viewers to fill in this element -- that there is anything ROMANTIC going on between Law and Weisz.  If there was, it got cut in favor of the scene in which the snipers, having pinned down their adversary, take a break to have sex and sleep. Unfortunately, their young friend pays the price of their licentious habits.I could go on and on about the way Arnaud insults our intelligence.  The Russians smoke hand rolled cigarettes looking like joints -- the evil German smokes gold foil, machine rolled cigarettes.  In case we forget that the Germans aren't really worse than the Russians, we are reminded of various attrocities.  In case we don't know what the Battle of Stalingrad was, the film explains it with an expository introduction complete with the colored Nazi region of a map expanding into the Soviets.  Oh, the Soviets are red, in case you forgot they were Communist.The movie is a farce; what pleasure is to be had is in spite of the movie. The cast is full of excellent actors, who I suppose help carry some of the bloated weight of the movie.  The special effects are neat, if misused. The sniper scenes are...well...sniper scenes, but you get a good hour of them if they're your thing.  And you see Weisz's naked rear.Yay.There are so many better movies made about WWII -- both from the European standpoint and the American.  If you're looking for a movie about the Evils of Stalin, I recommend Burnt by the Sun.  As for WWII flicks in general, there are enough that you can darn well find one yourself.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Shoot Thy Enemies,"Jude Law, Rachel Weisz, Joseph Fiennes and Ed Harris capture both the all-out poignancy of war as well as the frailty of man in the face of personal and extraneous challenge, in Enemy at the Gates. Easily one of the best war movies that I have seen, young Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law), sharpshooter from the Urals, finds himself the hero of the Battle of Stalingrad on account of his superlative sniper skills. He also finds love in the beautiful Moscow-educated Tania (Rachel Weisz) and the two catch some fleeting intimate moments in the midst of the horror. The fame and love awaken jealousy in no small measure in Commissar Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) who clears his conscience in one last cathartic act. And the showdown between the deer-hunting German nobleman sharpshooter Major Konig (Ed Harris) and Vassili is the piece-de-resistance of the movie. It is a rare combination of the depiction of the large-scale brutality of war coupled with the cat-and-mouse game of the two sharpshooters",10.0,Anonymous,History

"Generally good, but with a few problems","For the most part, I liked this film. It had a good story, based on historical people and events, some taut drama, a nice little love story on the side. It was well-shot and mostly well-acted.There are, however, a couple of significant problems with the film. First, there are the accents. Most of the actors made little effort at developing believable accents and spoke in their own accents. I could have lived with this, although some credible accents would have helped. What was really objectionable was Ron Perlman, who tried to speak with an accent, but it came out more Australian-sounding than Russian. He would have been better off just using his American accent.My other chief objection involved the climactic scene. Without delivering any spoilers, I will only say (as others have) that it seemed to have been plucked straight out of a western movie. There was not even any subtlety to that allusion, and it served no purpose in the film. My guess is that writer-director Jean-Jacques Annaud was a fan of those classic western showdown scenes and wanted to incorporate the look as a matter of style. It didn't work.Having made those objections, however, I will re-iterate that my overall impression of the film was positive. If you enjoy a good war film that is not just a ""rally round the flag"" kind of glorification of war, you will probably enjoy enough to make it worth watching.

Maybe more beautiful than interesting although the colors are mostly grey of various shades,"Great directorial command delivers this stunningly visual story of a legendary sniper as if seen through an intrusive telescope which sees beyond the fame. From the fist scene which fuels his legend to the final shot which suggests that his tale is one among many war tales, Jean-Jacques Annaud fully exerts his mastery of cinema. I don't wish to be pretentious and say that my opinion is the right one, but I think I won't be wrong to say the movie grasps some very moving human moments on film, and the fact alone that the fighting factions are both following ideologies which the United States bitterly fought against will likely make the viewer look at the human souls who are fighting. Although I make it sound as if the movie came from an art house, there are a few scenes which fans of sniper movies will appreciate, except unfortunately the last fight. The feeling of the movie, the unassuming ending and the beauty of the film--although its color palette is mostly grey with occasionally the colors of the flags, reminded me of the movie Ame Agaru, made by Kurosawa's crew after the director passed away.

It definitely deserved it, because ""Enemy at the Gates"" is a powerful and intense war film that centers on a type of soldier that rarely gets a full movie devoted to it: the sniper. This film's major accomplishment is that it shows the maddening and awful pressure-filled world of the sniper. Centering around Vassili Zaitsev, a young up-and-coming Russian private who has amazing shooting accuracy, the film not only shows the awfulness of battle and the carnage of war (with the Russians killing their own attempting-to-flee soldiers), but how the media turns Vassili into a hero-even though he is chafing under the constraints of his new role. Thus, ""Enemy at the Gates"" is simultaneously an action-packed war drama and a grim media satire. The peformances are high-quality, with Jude Law as Vassili, Joseph Fiennes as his tormented friend Danilov, and Rachel Weisz as Tania Chernova, the woman who tears the two apart. Also, Bob Hoskins is coarse and humorous as Nikita Khrushkev, while Gabriel Thomson gives an excellent portrayal as Sacha Filipov, the Russian boy who attempts to play both sides against eachother-but learns that one does not mess with the Nazis as easily as one would like to. The standout, however, is the incomparable Ed Harris as Major Konig, a master Nazi sniper who the Germans bring in to take out Vassili. Harris' performance is one of his lesser-known roles, but it shows his mastery of understatement. In fact, it is his character's very emotionlessness that makes him all the more frightening. There are amazing battle sequences (the early Russian vs. German, where the Russians are basically mowed down, is heartbreaking in its futility, as there is a packet of ammo and a gun for every two soldiers), and the final moments between Konig and Vassili show Law and Harris at the top of their game (the quiet physical statement Harris makes at the end is a perfect representation of his character). Also, the love story is as heartfelt as it is desperate. Many comments say this section of the movie was ""clumsy"" and ""unnecessary"". I disagree, I feel that the attraction between Tania and Vassili is beautiful, while Fiennes is perfect in expressing the pain-filled jealousy of Danilov. These important relationships are what leads up the final shocking moments-without the love story, the film loses much of its power. Truly, ""Enemy at the Gates"" is a worthy film-at least better than ""Windtalkers"".",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Pretty average overall, waste of a great set","Being a bit of a history buff I had high hopes for this movie but it let me down, it was just average on almost every level.The first 15 minutes or so is actually fairly eye opening, but the film doesn't kick on from there and slowly gets more dull as it progresses.The set is spectacular, but that's the end of the good news. The script felt like it was written in a day, it's completely void of wit and is barely insightful, I could've been watching a bad TV movie. The acting suffers as a result and none of the main cast shines, Ed Harris especially was wasted his character is badly developed and despite being the main bad guy we know almost nothing about him.The soundtrack is disappointingly dull and forgettable, the only up side is it is numbingly sappy so it fits in with the rest of the movie.So that's it, a blown opportunity to tell a great story about Stalingrad, Enemy At The Gates is ordinary from start to finish.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"History should come first, profits second!","Great! Another American pro-""freedom of the rich"" propaganda movie with loads of stereotypes and errors. The movie makes fun of the Soviet people and their struggle against fascism. They saved Europe from Nazism. More than 70% of the Nazi troops were annihilated on the eastern front. Unlike what most people here in the west think...Furthermore, people who don't know better are tricked to believe that the movie is accurate and that the arguments against certain political ideas are good and true. The movie also tries to be witty in its critique against the permanent struggle for a better life.The logic is: Whenever man struggles for freedom from oppression (poverty, unemployment and homelessness are also forms of oppression - only the rich are free) it fails. There's no need for even trying fighting for a better society. That's the meaning behind the movie. To make money and make soviets look evil in favor of our own ""superb"" society. Of course it's superb for the people who can afford to make the movie.Looks like only the ones with money can get their messages and ideas across.

One of the best war movies ever made. A classic sharpshooter film!,"This film had everything you could possibly want in a film and has a little bit from every film genre. It has violence, drama, suspense, romance, and is based on a true story. It takes place in Stalingrad, U.S.S.R. during World War II, and Jude Law plays a Russian sniper who has killed so many German officers during the siege of the city that he is making the front pages of Russian newspapers and is boosting the morale among many Russians. Law eventually finds out about a German sniper (Ed Harris) who is even better than him and feels that he doesnt stand a chance against Harris. After being the ""hunter"" for so long, Law is like a mouse and Harris is a cat, and Law finds himself pinned down to a point where he is near helpless. He has help from Joseph Fiennes, who is a fellow Russian soldier and a good sniper as well, but Fiennes deserts Law by committing suicide and putting himself in the way of a bullet fired from Harris's rifle, making Law face Harris all alone. This movie is truly great, it has great scenery comparable to that of Saving Private Ryan, and the action scenes are incredible and realistic. But the greatest parts are of course the views through the crosshairs of the two rivals' sniper rifles, where you feel like you are a sniper inside the film. This is a great movie, no question about it. Feel free to email me if you have any questions or comments.",,Anonymous,History
"Totally awesome, man","At the risk of sounding jaded in my old age, I'm continuously amazed at the quality of reviews that can be summed in ""Wow, man.  Totally awesome!"" or, ""Man, this movie sucked.""  C'mon.  We pay these guys salaries buying tickets and renting videos or DVDs.  As such, we can do better by looking at the content and form of the film.  And, this film is excellent in both form and content.  I'm constantly intrigued by how the English can kick our butts in the acting game.  I mean, Jude Law is Vassily Zaitsev (the name means 'rabbit' in Russian, BTW) and Ed Harris, getting to be one of our best, is Koenig (I prefer the German spelling for 'king').  Fiennes and Weisz are likewise superb as is Hoskins, a long way away from his initial exposure in Roger Rabbit.  The theme of this film is chaos.  And, if you read the defense of Stalingrad, that's what it was.  Seeing the scenes in this wonderfully dark film reminded me of reading Simeonov's Dni I Nochi, 'Days and Nights,' one of the most accurately portrayed histories of the Red Army's defense of Stalingrad.  It is a superb film and, gang, let's get beyond mere grunts of approval and disapproval of a fine film as this one is.  Save it for the endless sequels of Teen-age Slice 'n Dice 25.""

A Dreary Film But Great Acting,"I wasn't too impressed with this film overall, but what was really good was the acting.  The film drags on ruthlessly between the duels of the Russian hero sharpshooter, played by Jude Law, and his enemy, the German sharpshooter, brilliantly played by Ed Harris.  The Ralph Fiennes role was interesting as well as we see him go from friend to traitor.  The dark mood of the film can't help to put a drab mood on the viewer as well, as it tries to be a ""Saving Private Ryan"" look-alike.  Unfortunately, the cinemotography used which tried to copy that modern war masterpiece didn't work in the context within this story.

Midnight in Moscow is sunshine in L.A.,"In this old Chris de Burgh song, an ironic one - I would just say, quite a sweet and a nice one - those meaningful words are solemnly spoken by an American spy on night out in a bar in Moscow; this one realises like nobody's business a truism as old as the hills: thou wouldn't grasp Russia with mind, but thou fool, no living man may hinder Russia as it is able to ruin anyone with its love No way, a Westerner would not grasp 'mystifying Russian soul', but since Russia, like it or not, as fate of history had willed it and at the price of several tens of millions of lives, assured the undisputed runners-up title in the world order, subjects of pragmatic and liberal Western world have nothing to do but to have little liking for and, rather, a dread of, that second-place echelon which breathes down their necks. That is about par for the course, so humanly: disliking one's rivals, grudging neighbours their success And if it came to pass, competitive neighbours lead their lives not exactly what one understand by 'civilised development' - the Lord himself, however culpable it would sound, has commanded to detest them!But hey, all the aforesaid is indeed a truism as old as the hills! Why then folks in Russia are jumping on a Western film about them?! Where have all those faultfinders not gone over: from Red Army insignia discrepancy to error of fact regarding Khrushchev; from ethnic dissimilarity causing Western actors' inability to play Russians - to scriptwriters' unawareness of Stalingrad Tractor Plant layout plan I could have defeated each point completely; could have given such a rebuke to each one, that each one would realise one's criticism would not stand up to criticism itself (to make a clean breast of it - their criticism isn't worth a tinker's curse!), but I would rather dwell on just two moments of truth. Just those very things (again, that is about par for the course) arouse indignation of those who get indignant at the film's dubious scenes and forget the saying 'if the cap fits, wear it'. That is: barrier troops in operation and bawdiness as between the male and female protagonistsNow listen to this, misters, if you got enraged when Western film-makers had shown too literal sense of war, moreover - of the most awful war of all times (this sense is: if you have been called up for fighting for your land, but chicken out, then you would better have both hands run over by a tram, otherwise you will have to hurl yourself at the enemy and not to retreat in confusion), that means not only that you have never been to war, but have not been interested in it. Or have always taken a rose-coloured view of war - as if it were something like an amusing shooting game. Like Wolfenstein, the extravagant plot of which - an American superhero overwhelms Hitler the robot - BTW, was so popular that just that very action game got rise to one of computer game main genres altogether, a 3D action. Well, I understand those who prefer living blissfully unaware of what the world order really is: witnesses are to be rubbed out! The present writer has never been to war but belongs to currently combatant nation, Russia. As Donbass War is in fact a moment of truth in its own manner: slyboots are being unmasked, righteous indignation is being reasoned, hackneyed existential fear tends to well up within; and finally, it is now turn of cynical and odious propaganda masterminds, who sooner or later, put a question with an edge to everyone: Who are you with, daredevil? He that is not with his nation is against it, thus a public enemy supposed to go through repressions.And as for casual sex among the bodies of soldiers sleeping side by side - it is 'elementary, my dear Watson' (as Sherlock Holmes would say) at all. I hold in high respect centuries-old culture of Christianity, where one must love none but god and, a fortiori, even the idea of desecrating the battlefield with sexual behaviour is impermissible! But isn't it high time for the fig-leaf to to go out of fashion?! You whom it sickens, turn aside. But you would neither deny that there was still sex at the Eastern Front! And indeed, many women cohabited with rear staff officers and took sulphapyridine (they believed ability to cause unwanted child's misbirth of that remedy for infection) on the sly while their husbands were dying on active service.However, I am going to bat for the film I used to watch more than once and still honour, not to vex those who, seemingly, treat it as untouchable. I just want to thank the West in these latter days of extraordinarily dramatic events for it, notwithstanding the unremitting animosity towards us, pays a tribute to us as to the potential adversary No 1 and shoots (attention! - first and foremost, for domestic market, thus for forming public opinion in their own countries!) high-budget films, where it is not an American flag that is waved, but a Soviet one. And thus a film-goer supports not Rambo, who kills thugs, who weari Soviet uniform, outright and on the spot, but the high-minded Soviet sniper Vasily Zaytsev who, notwithstanding all the totalitarian atrocities of his Motherland, loves it and shoots his coarse rifle accurately killing the invading aliens, who wear full-dress uniform and declaim with bombast that they came to 'exempt Russia from Jewish political instructors and that bloody Stalin, the arsonist and the murderer'",7.0,Anonymous,History
Forget it....,"I am highly interested in WW2 history, since my childhood, especially the Russian front. I have never lived this awful period, of course, but read hundreds and hundreds of documents provided by universities historians and also some testimonies from veterans. Testimonies are interesting, but never totally fair; the opponents, depending of the side they were from, only told their OWN truth, they sometimes forgot, transformed or invented facts. Historians, though they also studied documents written mainly from testimonies, were more reliable. I am just interested in facts. Period. And after watching this movie, very well directed and acted though, I prefer forget this one, really. Keep in mind that in Stalingrad, you had NO SS DIVISIONS, there were not Einsatzgruppen commandos slaughtering civilians, as there was in Belarus and Ukraine ; you only had soldiers fighting against other soldiers, that's all. of course thousands and thousands of civilians perished in this outrageous conflict, unfortunately. But with those facts, it is difficult to present the Stalingrad battle as the good vs evil scheme, as you can have with COME AND SEE, the best Russian war movie ever made, so powerful, realistic, terrific and traumatic for anyone, the audience and the players, especially this young lead character who, decades after the shooting, confessed to remain shocked by this outstanding destructive experience. I know that German army invaded Russia to exterminate the population or, at best, made her an army of slaves for the master race. But this American movie is on the same level as a Russian war film, only propaganda film, involving a romantic line to attract female audiences and forgetting the struggle of German soldiers as well the Russians. If you want to see a realistic film about this turn of the WW2, watch STALINGRAD, the German film, made by Joseph Wiesmaier, the side of those who lost the war. Or Even the totally, not lost, but forgotten Frank Wisbar's DOGS DO YOU WANT TO LIVE FOREVER, made in 1959, which showed the true and authentic face of Stalingrad battle, without showing bad Russians, though being a German film. This latest movie is available on free you tube, PLEASE WATCH IT, it is a billion times better than this crap for huge and idiot audiences who wish to learn the truth through Hollywood movies !!! Those jerks. German soldiers in Stalingrad were not fanatics, were not the Hitler Jügend division fighting in Normandy, those 16 or 17 years old kids fighting like the Japanese in Pacific islands for the Führer. Those German soldiers in Stalingrad fought only to survive, fought for their comrades; because in Wehrmacht, comrade notion was very important. Those soldiers came from the same region, went on leave together, had fun together, slept together on the front line, they were like brothers, they did not fight to defend their land, as the Russians did. So, how can we say that those poor but elite German troops were the evil ones in Stalingrad? How? In another region of Russia, OK, I admit, because Wehrmacht was involved in some civilian mass massacres. But, I repeat, not in Stalingrad. One last thing, it's a shame that Ed Harris has never played, characterized Erwin Rommel, the chief of the terrific Afrika Korps. A shame because I just realize that he had the very same face and eyes as the Desert Fox, who scared British troops at a scale you can't even imagine.",8.0,Anonymous,History

good war picture,"Jean-Jacques Annaud's `Enemy at the Gates' opens with an extended sequence depicting the 1942 Siege of Stalingrad that is almost as impressive, in its size, scope and battleground realism, as the Normandy Invasion scene in `Saving Private Ryan.'Although `Enemy at the Gates' never again returns to this level of greatness, it does emerge as a pretty decent war movie, nonetheless.  The film is based on the true story of a Soviet marksman, Sergeant Vassili Zaitsev, who finds himself - as much through fate and the efforts of an officer friend of his as through any act of bravery on his own part - suddenly thrust to the forefront as a national hero, a position created to bolster the fading morale of the Russian troops who are, at that moment, being mercilessly pounded by the Nazi war machine.  So famous  and, thus, so much a threat to Nazi security - has Vassili become, that the Germans have even sent their greatest sniper, Major Konig, to find and dispatch him.Thus, the film becomes at times a fascinating depiction of a cat-and-mouse duel of wits between two evenly matched antagonists both bent on the same outcome.  Ed Harris plays Konig with all the steely-eyed intensity of a bloodthirsty killer, as much driven by his need for personal triumph as his love of the greater cause.  In contrast, Vassili is portrayed as an almost reluctant hero, a man who would gladly relinquish the burden placed on him if circumstances could be different.  Part of the fascination of his character rests in the struggle Vassili undergoes as he tries to reconcile the heroic image of himself as portrayed in the newspapers with the all-too-human man of flesh and blood he knows himself to be.  Jude Law, despite his grating and wholly anachronistic English accent, underplays his role nicely, as does Joseph Fiennes, as Commissar Danilov, the Marxist idealist who comes up with the plan of turning Vassili's acts into the stuff of legend.In addition to covering an aspect of World War II that has long gone untouched by moviemakers until now, `Enemy at the Gates' provides us with an interesting plot - even though, at 130 minutes, it does tend to fall into a dramatic monotony every now and then.  Furthermore, the film is saddled with a romantic triangle of such surpassing banality that it threatens to reduce the movie in the final scenes to as great a pile of rubble as those we see so skillfully created by the set designer.  Speaking of which, the single greatest element of this film is clearly its meticulously mounted imagery of both chaotic battle scenes and the burned out remains of a devastated war torn city.  Kudos go out to all the film's technical people, its production designer, art directors, set decorator, editors, cinematographer, special effects technicians etc.  They have done a truly monumental job on this film.  Only James Horner's score turns out to be a bit problematic, since the first ten or so notes of the recurring main theme sound exactly like John Williams' work from `Schindler's List.'Yet, `Enemy at the Gates,' though not a perfect film, has much to offer in terms of its plot, its performances and, above all, its grand visual style. For that last aspect alone, the film should not be missed.",,Anonymous,History
A multi-faceted film sure to please anyone.,"Watching ""Enemy at the Gates"" is like watching multiple movies at one time. Rather than just being about World War II snipers, the film has been interjected with plots of romance and friendship, loyalty and betrayal, self-doubt and self-realization, heroism and cruelty, cowardice and bravery. Each of these themes is weaved carefully upon one another, and while integral to one another, remain self-sustaining.  No matter what genre the viewer is partial to, there is something in this movie that will reach out to them and connect.  The ever-brilliant Jude Law is wonderful in his performance as Russian sniper Vasilli and is surrounded by an array of astounding actors, such as Joeseph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz, Bob Hoskins and Ed Harris.  ""Enemy at the Gates"" is an emotionally charged movie that also delivers on its promise of action, a rare find in today's collection of mindless action movies and character-driven plotless films.  My favorite surprise in this movie was the acting ability shown by Rachel Weisz, who most will recognize from her role in the popular movies ""The Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns"" as Evelyn 'Evie' Carnahan.  Having seen her in mostly small roles, she more than met the demands of her character.  Overall, I would have to say this is a well-made movie with both a great plot and great acting; a movie of mass appeal and substance.",10.0,Anonymous,History

A good but not great war movie,"The best war movies in my humble opinion are those that endeavour to show it exactly as it is, i.e. that however much Gung Ho or patriotism or brainwashing or propaganda is involved and no matter how it is glorified and even how it does indeed sometimes make heroes of otherwise average and relatively insignificant men, war is hell, plain and simple! For anyone even vaguely familiar with the history of the Second World War the name Stalingrad towers head and shoulders above even Normandy, Iwo Jima and The Battle of The Bulge in sheer carnage. The movie ""Enemy at the Gates"", directed by Frenchman Jean Jacques Annaud (Seven Years in Tibet, The Bear), sets out to tell the personal tales of some individuals, both Russian and German in a much more focused account than the last movie of note to address the subject, the sweeping German production ""Stalingrad"" from 1993.In ""Enemy at the Gates"", Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law) is a young peasant from The Urals who is befriended shortly after his arrival into the horror of front line 1943 Stalingrad, by a Soviet propaganda officer, Commander Danilov, played by Joseph Fiennes, who, after witnessing first hand his prowess as a sniper in assassinating five German officers, sets out to elevate him to the status of hero in a bid to raise the spirits of a demoralised Red Army, who are battling to hold the last tenth of their ruined city against the German onslaught. To witness the graphic horror of how these two are thrown together at all, it is easy to see why 20 million Russians died in The Second World War. Arriving by train at the rail head across the Volga from the city proper, Zaitsev is fed into the mincing machine that was the Second World War's Verdun, along with his ""comrades"", where the instructions from the commanding officers, since there aren't enough rifles to go around is, ""follow the man in front of you until he is killed and then take his rifle"". This, along with those retreating being machine gunned down by their own officers as cowards and traitors to The Motherland is, it seems, what goes for motivation in besieged Stalingrad.It is upon this opportunity, therefore, that Commander Danilov seizes, to sell his motivational hero idea to the field commander, one Nikita Krushchev, played quite excellently by Bob Hoskins. The plan is wholly embraced by Khrushchev and before long Zaitev has become a legend, receiving fan mail from Factory Workers and Coal Miners all over the Motherland as his ever increasing German officer kill tally is daily reported. Indeed so successful does the legend of Zaitev become, and so counter demoralising for the Germans, that they dispatch an ace sniper of their own, one Major Koenig (played by Ed Harris), to Stalingrad to hunt down and kill Zaitsev.This is the main preoccupation of the rest of the movie, apart from a parallel subplot, the female love interest, of a female sniper Tania Chernova, played by a strikingly pretty Rachel Weizs, whom both friends fall in love with, which understandably leads to major jealousy, particularly on the part of Danilov and puts a major strain in their friendship, as they fight their own little battle for her affection within the claustrophobic ruins of the city.The battle of wills and wits of the opposing snipers is gripping, particularly in the way they track each other and try to anticipate each others thoughts, and other methods (In Koenig's Case, the enlisting of a young Russian boy, Vasha (Gabriel Thompson), by chocolate and food bribes, who though he worships and idolizes Danilov, yet feeds Koenig information about him, perhaps in a bid to entrap the German, as he also relays information back to Danilov and Zaitsev about the German and his whereabouts) In any case, whilst the hunt it is filled with suspense, in the end it does become a bit drawn out and makes the movie perhaps a half an hour longer than it should be.Apart from some of the dramatic failings of this movie, it does manage to portray a horrific and realistic picture of the tragedy of war, and like all great anti war movies, if it achieves nothing else but this, then it can be justifiably deemed a good movie. It is however not a ""great"" war movie up there with ""All Quiet on The Western Front"", ""The Great Dictator"", ""The Red Badge of Courage"", ""The Longest Day"", ""Platoon"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"".",6.0,Anonymous,History

Battle of the Snipers.,"'Enemy at the Gates' is a partially factual and partially fictionized film set in Stalingrad during World War II.In 1942, sniper Vassili (Jude Law) is sent to war-torn Stalingrad where he befriends Commisar Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) after saving his life. Vassili joins the sniper division, and with Danilov working for the army's newspaper, Vassili's killings are soon published in the newspaper.This, however, attracts attention from the Germans, and they send a sniper, Major Konig (Ed Harris) to eliminate him. What follows, is a cat and mouse game between the two snipers. A Young boy named Sacha is used as a go-between between Vassili and Konig. Sacha plays such an important part in the film. For a while he might come across as a traitor, until his true intentions are revealed.Rachel Weisz stars as Tania Chernova, the romantic interest between both Vassili and Danilov.

And don't be puzzled by a sniper-duel deciding the bloodiest battle in Human History... you know, 1,5 million people gave their lives there, and had no fun doing it. Stalingrad is a place you shouldn't touch if you want to make popcorn-cinema.if you happen to like decent (anti-)war movies, then forget this one. get the book. and watch ""Stalingrad"".",1.0,Anonymous,History
"Might seem ok, if you're not familiar with real history.","The only plausible reason for this movie's existence is the director's ego.Why do I say this? I find it remarkable that he would find the actual events surrounding the battle of Stalingrad so un-compelling that he would choose to invent his own reality. The movie is called enemy at the gates suggesting the enormous epic battle of Stalingrad, but this is not to be. It would have been better to name it the duel, as that is the real focus of the movie. By showing the battle in the very beginning, the movie is trying to have it both ways, but it can't. By the middle you might forget that there are millions of people involved on both sides, tanks on the ground, planes in the air, boats in the river. Instead you might think the red army did not have a single tank or plane after watching this movie.Going into the battle Annaud aims for a sense of dread, but misunderstands the motivations of the characters. Among the main things is that Russian soldiers actually WANTED to go to the front lines. Something Annaud apparently can't fathom. Kids would run away from home and lie about their age. Teens that finished school went off for military training. Men left their families to do their duty. Few doubted that the war would be won, it was simply a matter of when. When the troops arrive at the shore of the broken city, Annaud again misfires. The soldiers did not have a shortage of weapons. This was already the middle of the war, factories were working day and night, with even tractor factories making tanks. Nor were the men turning back. It was not an option, there was nowhere to fall back. They knew that if they didn't hold on the war could be lost. When you are fighting for the survival of your home you don't need any more motivation then that. Let's not forget that the soldiers are fighting for their own soil. What Annaud was probably thinking of was a ""ShtrafBat"" a battalion made of soldiers accused or cowardice or other often false accusations. These were literally used to clear minefields by marching through them! These did have NKVD machine gunners shooting anyone that turned back. This is something more gruesome then anything Annaud imagined, but this was usually not the case for regular troops.Moving on, there's absolutely nothing wrong with focusing on the sniper battle, it's extremely compelling. However Annaud would almost have you believe it had a key importance to the battle itself, which it couldn't have. It's merely a vignette, though a really fascinating one. Nor was Zaitsev alone. The newspapers would take ANY event they considered significant and spread the news all over the country. The idea that Zaitsev was used as some sort of motivation for not losing the war is therefore ludicrous.What it boils down to is that the movie might have been good had Annaud not delved into the bigger picture and became mired in things he didn't understand. The sniper battle itself is at times captivating. Had the movie narrowed the focus to the two opposing snipers themselves it might have been great. Adding on the love story and trying to comment on everything from politics to tactics bogged it down. Annaud would have done better to simply bring a handful of old Russian war movies to western screens, for they have covered this all before, and covered it better.",,Anonymous,History

The 2nd best film of 2001 and one of my favorite films!,"Enemy at the Gates is one of the coolest and best war films of all-time. The character study of this film is magnificent and Jude Law put up a great performance as Vasili Zaitsev. The score by James Horner was the greatest out of the whole film. This is one of his best scores, equal to Glory and Braveheart's. His music is what really made the movie! The sniper shootings in this movie also was amazing. Ed Harris as the German sniper did great to by battling Vasilli. Anyways, this film is great, the 2nd best film of 2001.

Brutality of War,"This film never stops to let one catch his breath! Except for the unnecessary love interest.  The scenery, the multitude of actors, the combat are all magnificent. For those who are buffs of WW2, they will not be put off by the fact that the real Vassily Zaitsev looked more like Bob Hoskins than Jude Law, or the real killing of Major Koenig was done because Zaitsev was more clever in hunting down Koenig than Koenig was hunting down Zaitsev [Zaitsev's fatal shot was into a darkened area of a building that he correctly surmised was where Koenig had to be.] That notwithstanding, the film was a gripping account of a handful of people caught up in what was probably the most horrific battle in recorded history. Ed Harris was fantastic in his understated role as the war-weary Major Koenig, made more stark by his pulling down the train window shades on the trainload of shattered German soldiers across from him, and the irony that these battered men were the real lucky ones: they were leaving the hell-hole of Stalingrad.  Bob Hoskins was brilliant as Nikita Kruschev and his energy carried the political suasion; the men who sent young men out into battle with the admonition that when the man in front of them was killed they were to pick up his rifle and carry on.  I do not think that in this stage of the war, the Russians were quite as willing to send out cannon fodder (ten Russians for each German)as they were at the outset of Barbarossa in June of 1941. But the battle scenes and the Russians shooting their own retreating soldiers, brought back for me the state of affairs that faced the Russians in June 1941, and the rude welcome surviving POWS got when they returned to Mother Russia after the war. The scenes in Stalingrad were as real as it got 59 years ago.  A fine film, despite a few problems. It affected my wife, who found it hard to sleep that night with the thought of the slaughter in a war that could have easily been prevented.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Best WWII Movie I've Seen,"Read the title of the review, and let me tell you something, I've seen a lot.  I remember when Saving Private Ryan came out I went in excited, and came out bored out of my mind and half asleep.  For this movie on the other hand, I expected some good battle scenes (this prejudice of war films had been given to me by Saving Private Ryan) but the rest would probably be s***.  I was wrong, while it would have been better without the love interest, it was good.  Solid performances, especially Jude Law and Ed Harris, some of the most beautiful cinematography I've ever seen (kudos to Robert Fraisse the DP), and a nice story line to boot.  I wouldn't be surprised if this film gets a couple Oscar nods (especially cinematography), but then again I wouldn't be surprised if it didn't get any (except cinematography).  There were high points and low points, but the high ones dwarfed the lows.  A great film that pays tribute to one of the greatest heroes of WWII (Vassily Zeitsev).8/10P.S.  Some history sources actually tell of a relationship between Zeitsev and Chernova.  Others don't say a thing about it.  I just thought I'd add that for the people who thought the love interest was thrown in by Hollywood.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Saving Stalingrad,"The photography reveals a Stalingrad that hardly anyone would want either to conquer or defend. Ominous, gloomy, wrecked, under gray snow-laden clouds, like the city in Kubrik's Full Metal Jacket. Everything is, or looks, gray in one or another tone. In the chemical factory, even a pile of sulfur, than which nothing is yellower, turns into a bright but sickly chlorine green. No wonder Brighton Beach and Elizabeth, New Jersey, are now filled up with Russians; they left home because of the weather.The sounds come down to us from Saving Private Ryan. I don't think war movies will ever be the same. The German MG42s sputter and the bullets clunk and spatter. As in SPR or Band of Brothers the bullets hit iron with serial clanks. It's imitative but there have been improvements too. We can be grateful that we no longer have to listen to every other shot resulting in one of those long wobbling ricochets, PtewEWewEW.... as the bullet whines into the infinite vastness of space. The sound departments used to be so fond of that particular noise that I've heard it when bullets glance off, not only hard surfaces like rocks, but wooden planks, sod, everything but flesh.The musical score is appropriate to the setting, with occasional echoes of Prokoviev. The acting is adequate. The most interesting character -- and they are all kind of interesting -- is not Zaitsev, the nominal hero, but the Commisar, spurned by his beloved who has fallen for the pop idol sniper, and who turns spiteful and destructive before sacrificing himself.The direction too is adequate. Tania has a scene in which she relates the sad story of how her parents were bundled out of town with other prisoners and then executed by the Nazis. As she goes through this monologue, a plaintive sad tune wanders into the sound track (a hint to the audience that this is a sad story). Meanwhile the camera very slowly dollies up from a medium shot to a close up (an even broader hint to the audience that this story is not only sad but important). In a later scene, Zaitsev is told that his lover has been killed and the camera moves in to a close up of a gigantic eyeball in which a tear seems to be forming. I kept wondering how Ozu would have handled this in something like ""Tokyo Story"", which was full of sad tales. His camera wouldn't have moved an inch. And I think I believed it the first time a reflection momentarily blinded the sniper in ""The African Queen"" but I sure can't swallow this instance, which takes place in a darkened factory.I wish more directors had enough faith in their audiences' ability to recognize tragedy when they see it. You know, when you think about it, there were very few movies made about the conflict between the USSR and Nazi Germany until fairly recently. The post-war political environment in the USA wasn't such as to encourage heroic portraits of the Commies, and yet we couldn't go with the Nazis either for obvious reasons. Nobody making American movies would have known which side they wanted the audience to root for.This one is pretty even handed as far as that goes. It's mostly seen from the Russian's point of view, and, with the exception of Ed Harris's character, they are the only ones we get to know. (There is a very nice scene of Zsaitsev and Tania making furtive frightened love amid a horde of snoring bodies in a shelter; we briefly see her ivory, smooth, generous butt and it's not at all erotic.)Harris is cool, professional, has lost a son on the Eastern front, and is prepared to die. And, man, does Harris have the body language of the European aristocrat down pat. He sits with crossed legs and polished boots, serenely puffing a cigarette, his face placid. But he definitely revolts the audience when he takes a young boy whom he has gotten to like out into the ruins and hangs him as bait.Zaitsev is positively embarrassed by his notoriety in the media. Khrushchev is bullying and brutal, and the Commisar mouths socialist clichés. (We had to give them a kick in the pants somehow, I guess.) As for the sniping, it's the best part of the picture. I mean, it's hard to make movies about people whose main job is to lie there without moving for long periods. But these guys are sharp. They never miss. Every kill is a head shot. And they can cut a telephone line at 155 meters with one bullet. If they were any better they'd be superhuman. And, again, the audio is not embellished during the few shots we see. POP, and that's it. No clichés. It's a rather nicely done movie, kind of an easy one to get into, and, tense if not gripping, it carries a viewer along.War is a funny thing though. I can't think of another business in which you become a hero by killing more human beings than anybody else. The film avoids the whole issue.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"In the forest, the wolf lives for three years and the donkey for nine.","Your jaw drops as you see Russian recruits charging German lines in Stalingrad, and then being shot by their own when they try to retreat. You know this film is going to show a carnage of the greatest magnitude.Amidst the carnage, Commisar Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) meets Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law), a man with deadly aim. When Nikita Khrushchev (Bob Hoskins) visits, Danilov proposes that they use all means to promote Vassili's skill to increase the morale of the people. Soon, like Sergeant York, his legend grows throughout Stalingrad, and the people are temporarily happy. As Khrushchev says, ""Vodka is a luxury we have, caviar is a luxury we have, time we do not have."" The problem is that the German bring in Major König (Ed Harris) to find Vasilli. Konig is just as good as Vasilli, maybe better, and a cat and mouse game begins.The always lovely Rachel Weisz is there, and Danilov is pursuing her aggressively, while Vasilli looks on longingly.

Fiennes and Law give equally strong performances and work well together on screen creating a friendship that is soon to be doomed.

A Glorious Fiction,"""Based on a true story"" are the most deceitful and ridiculous words in the Hollywood lexicon. People here do realize this is a fictitious account? It's not supposed to be a documentary, so if that is what you are looking for, I would direct you to the History Channel. If you want to read books on the subject, I would advise you to begin with Antony Beevor's Stalingrad: The Fateful Siege 1942-1943 (1998).The film clocks in at 2h 11m which is just about perfect for an epic film of this scale. It seems that the new cinema has completely disregarded conventions (and people's attention spans) about film length. We now have Netflix pumping out moronic romantic-comedies that run two and a half hours, or about two hours too many in most cases. If you are just going to watch it at home, why not make shorter films? It's as if directors think that added length gives their projects majesty. It doesn't, it makes them tedious.What makes for good fiction are great characters and Jean-Jacques Annaud gives us a troop transport full of memorable roles. Almost everyone in the film stands out, even if only for a few lines. Bob Hoskins as the head Soviet gangster is remarkable in his modest contribution.Ed Harris as the stately, aristocratic Nazi officer makes his grand entrance at the 34m mark. His rank is completely incongruent with the nature of his work, no matter what explanation is given, but a field officer doing grunt work isn't exactly a deal-breaker. Obviously, his rank and aristocratic air make him more of a worthy villain for the humble shepherd boy turned Nazi hunter.The sets were simply amazing and looked about as much like the ruined city of Stalingrad as anything outside of old black and white photos. Everyone looked sufficiently bedraggles and dirty to match the squalor of a city under siege.The love story angle seems a bit trite for such an enormous conflict, the not amounting to a hill of beans mentioned in yet another movie set in war time.",9.0,Anonymous,History
The other side of WWII,"Enemy At The Gates gives us the view of WWII from the Russian point of view. The story takes place entirely during the German siege of Stalingrad.  In first few scenes, we see just how badly Hitler wanted this city.  What we are subjected to is a nightmarish scenario.  Russian infantrymen are herded from train cars into boats and ferryed across the Volga river.  While taking the dangerously slow trip, they are subject to fire from attacking German fighters.  If they survive, they still have to fight on land, or be shot as cowards.  There is little dialouge in these opening scenes and for once, I'm glad that there was no decision to put dialogue here.  You can almost compare the opening to a silent film, with the images flashing across the screen and expressions of the actors faces conveying all the information you need.  Once the opening chaos has died down, we begin to get to know Jude Law's Vassily, the famed sharpshooter.  Law plays him well.  A young man from the Urals who just happens to be a world class shot, but not to knowledgeable of the politics surrounding him.  Joseph Finnes is the political officer that begins to extol the virtues of this young man and begins to make him a larger than life hero.  Because of the damage inflicted by Vassily, the Germans send in their own sharpshooter.  Ed Harris plays Major Konig with steely eyed reserve.  His actions are carefully metered out and his silence shows his strength.  What starts out as a battle between the Russians and the Germans becomes a struggle between two men who are both the best at what they do.  What follows is a film that showcases great performances from Law and Harris and scenes of tension that will make you hold your breath.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A little too long but still worth a look...,"A film with some great set piece battle scenes involving hundreds of extras; it does look quite epic in places. I would have liked to have seen it on the big screen, I'm sure it was quite impressive. The music was pretty good; mainly relying on great sweeping themes throughout it did put me in mind of another epic war film set in Russia. All the performances were very good with Jude Law, Rachel Weisz and Ed Harris standing out for me. It was one of those films that was good, with ambitions of being great but never quite getting there. Sadly I felt that the love triangle got in the way, a bit, of a decent war film.

An Action-Packed War Film,"In late 1941 the German Army was crushing everything in sight and was moving deep into Russian territory. Then they came to Stalingrad, and despite the fact that they continued to inflict heavy casualties upon the Russian Army (and Russian civilians), they couldn't break through to the other side of the Volga River. So, with both sides dug in behind every rock and crevice, the snipers took over. On the Russian side was a young soldier named ""Vassili Zaitzev"" (Jude Law) who became legendary due to the efforts of a comrade by the name of ""Commisar Danilov"" (Joseph Fiennes) who happened to work for the propaganda department of the Communist Party. On the German side was ""Major Konig"" (Fred Harris) who was perhaps the best sniper in all of Germany. But this story goes much deeper than that as it is filled with intrigue, drama and tragedy. Now, being an American it is difficult for me to really cheer for either side as they were both led by evil murderous tyrants. But this is a story more about human courage and sacrifice than it is about any specific evil person or ideology. And that is what makes this film so compelling. The action was plentiful but unlike so many other ""action films"" this one had good acting as well. I especially liked the performances of Jude Law and Joseph Fiennes. But in any case, this is a movie that should definitely appeal to those who enjoy an action-packed war film. Definitely above average.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"Mano a Mano, Sniper to Sniper","""Enemy at the Gates"" is set in the second World War, on the border between the Soviet Union and Germany (actually, more in the Soviet Union, as the Germans have reached Stalingrad). But the story is of one man, a farm boy who has grown up to be a sharp-shooter. We see his skill, his love, and his adversary.This film is fairly interesting because, from America's point of view, neither Germany or Russia was really the ""good guy"", even if we officially had Russia on our side. But here we focus on a man, who like any other soldier or even any human, has the same struggles and feelings. So, we can't help but feel sympathy for him, even if we want to dislike the Russians. (I, for one, do not identify any one person with their country, but it's easy to do.) The commissar tries to paint things on a national level, saying that the sniper conflict is ""not just a war of countries, but class struggle"" because the Russian is a farm boy and the German went to good schools. How much any Soviet citizen or official took this sort of view seriously, I don't know. To me, it sounds flaky. The Soviet Union had very little to do with class struggle after the first few years, and I'm fairly certain everyone knew that. But, I could be wrong.Another piece of wisdom bestowed in the film is: ""In the forest, the wolf lives for three years, the donkey for nine."" They explain this means that the more useful creature ought to live longer, justifying the uneducated getting sent to war so the educated can keep society running.

Works more as fictionalized history than as historical fiction,"Vasilli Zaitsiev(Jude Law,rugged features and green eyes a-blazing)becomes a folk hero in be-sieged Stalingrad,1942-43. And it seems perfectly reasonable:the de-moralized and starving locals and Soviet army dispatch is facing the brutal,relentless pressure of the advancing NAzi armies,so a deadly effective sniper who has the German's guessing their ground strategy is naturally gonna be greatly needed. Of course,this walking hero/legend is also all flesh and blood,as he is both being lionized by a local patrician/officer(Joseph Fieenes,looking more and more like Ralph all the time)and carrying a growing torch for a local girl(RAchel Weisz,still radiant through mud,muck and blood)who happens to work the infantry and is fluent in German.That happens to be exactly what an ace marksman and officer in the SS named KOnig(ED HArris,fantastic as the coldly determined,not altogether inhuman German menace)is hoping for,as he scans and scours the streets of the war-torn central Russian town to finish off.HAving just read(More like scanned)a review that had a very dim view of the re-telling of actual historical fact,I think I can say that this movie is(without being nearly as EAgle-eyed as that reviewer)probably more intended to be sheer entertainment rather than a particularly close examination or documentation of the very pivotal and important battle that has by many been thought to be one of the key turning points in WWII. That will leave people who want to see more studious retelling in the cold,and even as pure entertainment will seem a little flat. Still,the characters and situations are just fleshed-out and kept compelling enough that a lesser invested viewer(like myself,for instance) will come away feeling reasonably satisfied,if not ""wowed"". Director JEan-Jacques Arnaud seems to be content making a much larger pieced of World history a much more intimate and human struggle,and it doesn't make for TOO uncomfortable of a film experience. If one feels much desire to see this at all,it would probably fall pretty safely in the category of ""Renter"".",8.0,Anonymous,History

A war movie very much worth watching,"It is a very good movie, I did not notice that it was actually more than two hours long. Perhaps it was more emotional for me than for other people, since my grandfather perished in the siege of Stalingrad.The movie has superb acting as well as few flaws.Jude Law gave wonderful performance, he looked 100% Russian soldier during the siege, thin, dirty, desperate. I liked Joseph Fiennes's Othello like jealosy, when he saw Vassili and Tania together. Rachel Weizs and especially Ed Harris were superb too.Visuals of battle scenes and pictures of city devastation were stunning, the war was bloody and ugly, like every war really is.I am quite surprised that nobody here mentions the most obvious goof, the fact that Nikita Khruschev NEVER was neither commander in chief, nor major officer of the Stalingrad front. In fact, he was a political officer like Danilov during the war. I am not even sure if he was at Stalingrad at all. It almost escaped my mind, why would screenwriter put him in this position, when I realized that Khruschev is well known in America. He famously gave speech in United Nations and put missiles in Cuba. While the real mastermind behind Russian victory in Stalingrad (as well as the whole WWII victory on Eastern Front in Europe) was general Georgiy Zhukov. But who would know him in America, except for geeks, watching the History Channel? Given the fact that movie slightly exagerrates with painting Russian Army black, perhaps it is not too bad, that Khrushev will take the blame instead of real hero Zhukov. Though Khruschev's son is a history professor and naturalized American citizen now, I think he has a strong case for libel. Anyway, the movie is fiction, not a documentary, at least here Russians won, not somebody else (case in point, U-571).As many people have already pointed, movie also downplays the fact that Russians fought for survival and defended their motherland and did not always have to be motivated with bullets from their own political officers.In spite of these obvious flaws, I still think that this is a great movie. It shows courageous and noble people as well as the scum. And what is the greatest thing, that now Americans will learn that Russians fought in WWII too! Seriously, this movie might get few people read something about this period in history. Martha Stuart would have said that this is a good thing. Don't you think so?",9.0,Anonymous,History

Wanted: Fine looking film seeks convincing actor,"This movie started off with something of a bang and ended as a pathetic whimper - and in all honesty the middle was slow and torturous. Although Joseph Fienes made a reasonable effort as the ambitious love sick officer, his performance was completely nullified by Jude Law and Rachel Weisz exchanging hot glances and ladelling out their lines in a sort of South London British accent. Suspension of Disbelief was away on the Western front drinking French wine and chasing the girls. Perhaps the most appalling delivery was given by Eva Mattes (Mrs Fillipov) who was not only wooden and stilted but also fell pray to the lame brained idea that Russians are all British citizens who went on holiday and overshot Spain. The only one to really shine in the movie was Ed Harris who brings off the role of the cold blooded marksman with some style. Kudos to the casting agent who signed him on. The special effects were outstanding and I must say the battle sequences were shocking and believable, however they were too few to paper over the cracks. For most of the movie I was wondering where they had left the war. The love interest, the family drama, the personal issues ... all very diversionary but I went to see a war movie.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Sniper's point of view,"Growing up I was raised by a WWII vet from Canada's Royal Canadian Regiment and other war veterans from WWII and Korea and they taught me that the best sniper's have brown eyes, blue eyes aren't a good asset at all as a sniper.

Movie that gives you a really good feeling of the WWII,"This movie goes about the Battle of Stalingrad that took place from end 1942 to begin 1943. The Nazi's send very many troops to Russia to conquer the oilfields. Instead of capitulating, the low-technised Soviets, fought back with all their man and might.Instead of Pearl Harbor, this movie is not very romantised and more pointed on giving you the feeling of this very ugly war accros the Volga river. Joseph Fiennes plays the role of a Russian Political Officer, Danilov. His life is being rescuied by the soldier Zaitsev played by Jude Law with a talent for snipering. Danilov makes a hero of Zaitsev and he comes in the Russian Newspaper. Vassili Zaitsev becomes a warhero. When the Nazi's are aware of Zaitsev, they send a very high talented sniper from Bayern to Stalingrad to take out Zaitsev. This role is being played by Ed Harris, who plays Herr Konig.There is also playing a little romance between Zaitsev and Tania (Rachel Weisz) also a Russian soldier.I liked this movie very much because it is very realistic. It reminds me of Saving Private Ryan, wich was also played on a bloody battlefield.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"reasonably well acted movie, good plot, simple but well done","This film has a good yet simple plot, solid acting efforts by Fiennes and particularly Jude Law and a surprisingly mature interpretation from Ed Harris.

Big Disappointment!,"I was looking forward to watching this film, having heard very favourable reviews on its release.I was impressed by the cinematography and action sequences, but they were never enough to hold my attention, because the story was WEAK.  Placing so much emphasis on the love triangle between Law, Fiennes and Weisz was a big mistake - I didn't believe it.I also felt that the actors could have at least attempted to speak with a German or Russian accent (like in the old movies).  Some of the Cockney and American accents just sounded ridiculous in that situation.  The dialogue was cheesy, and some of the acting was amateur.  I only hope they put the snipers to good use and bump off the scriptwriters before they write any more of this tripe!",6.0,Anonymous,History
Speaking Russian and German,"When watching movies staged in foreign countries I always find it interesting to see if they will use sub-titles or just go with an accented English. I've come to notice that the use of sub-titles only occurs when there is one foreign language to be used. Though I appreciate this movie sometimes I wonder if it would have been better served to use sub-titles to show the extreme differences between Russia and Germany at the time. A lot of the accents from both sides seem similar so it almost has that civil war type feel to it. But, overall an enjoyable movie that really keeps you interested and on the edge of your seat.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Could and should have been better,"I have not read the book, nor did I know much about the real story before watching this. As I understand, however, it is more interesting than this. This actually does start to go for the tension-filled world that is sniping(and may I add, they move excessively in this, Zaitsev in actuality remained still for *days*, ready to fire), with excellent details, but it seems they were afraid to take the full step. Ah, to think of what could have been. There are a couple of impeccable battle sequences, highly intense and engaging. We get a ton of Hollywood crap, including an argument against socialism(because, you know, the masses are not unhappy and living in fear and risk under capitalism; it's the least negative system, not a perfect one), a schmaltzy love triangle, and some ""this time, it's personal!""-style conflict. The acting is great. Law, Harris, Weisz and Fiennes all do marvelous in the leads, Perlman is always fun to watch and Hoskins completely *nails* Khrushchev. Production values leave little to be desired; however, the design utterly fails to convey the extreme weather conditions, as well as, for the majority of it, the threat of life near the front lines. Impartiality would have made this a far superior film. Repeating a point of view that the American audience already agrees with isn't impressive. Is the US still that terrified of Communism? A skilled director can put forth the idea that something is right or wrong without bluntly having characters state it. The DVD comes with ""additional scenes"", varying in length, a theatrical trailer, and two featurettes that I will review on their individual pages. There is a little sexuality, disturbing content and brief brutal violence in this. I recommend this to fans of those involved, and/or war flicks. There are considerably smarter ones out there, though. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,History
Interesting stuff,"I myself was never into war epic movies. Oppressive violence on screen never did seem to impress me much.While ""Enemy at the Gate"" provides us with the regular amount of blood, gunfires and chopped up men a respectful war flick demands, it also portrays a different kind of battle, one of patience, unshaken stillness and quietness. It's a fascinating duel between sharpshooters Law (on the Soviet side) and Harris (on the German side) who was sent out to Stalingrad especially to kill troublemaker Vassili (Law). What we witness is a battle through the eyes of the duelers and, despite of the contrast with the loud environment it never falls into a dull moment. On the contrary. The intensity that the precise eye closeups convey is tangible enough to keep us hooked.Also the cast helps immensely, of course. They certainly had a lot of sensibility casting actors with such remarkable expression on their eyes.Law is altogether fierceness and tenderness. He's absolutely alluring on screen, everything he does is fascinating and you don't wanna miss one single movement. Every gesture, every glance of his eyes has this depth and sincerity that are incredibly captivating.Now Ed Harris is a guy who truly supports a film. He inflicts so much intensity in such a subtle way that even though he's not the main character, you can't imagine the movie without him. And also there're those fusillading blue eyes of his which can be as sharp as any weapon.In the Sovietic side we also have Joseph Finnes, as a regular Russian intellectual, obviously more useful on tactical field than on battle field. A very skilled writer who created the legend of sniper shooter turned into Soviet pride Vassili. Rachel Wiesz represents the women on front. Another strong presence in the film.On the background, astonishingly crafted battle scenes, breathtaking bombings and an incredibly realistic setting. Great cinematography recreates properly the bleakness and desolation of a grim Stalingrad back in 1942.Romance is inevitably provided by the love triangle among Law, Finnes and Weisz'characters (apparently the war was not enough to keep them busy).If I had to pick a favorite war movie, this is it.

"Very good, but nothing to do with history","Enemy at the gates. Good movie. I liked it. Sad, but true - never could be even close to ""Iron cross""(Cross of iron). Actually the film is very well made, but there are some mistakes. First of all when WWII starts Vasilij Zaicev is a sergeant in the Red army and not just a private. He was not a nature talent. He was first in a sniper school. Actually he is known as one of the best snipers in the world's history with an impressive list of 242 (two hundre fourty two) shot german officers. Wow. Of course his duel with the german sniper is a fiction. So is his love with Tania. It's just a story. How ends Vasilii's sniper career? Few months before the end of the war he gets shot in the head. The wound is very bad. Once the doctors save him, they find out, that there is a danger for him losing his left eye - the bullet almost had cut off the nerves. He gets lucky - he survives the wound, and even his eye recovers. Not like before, regretfully. His sniper days are over and he receivs a place in a sniper school, training young soldiers how to be killing mashines, like he was before. This i's V. Zaicev' story, his real story I mean and since you have probably seen the film, you already know that it's just Hollywood crap, especially the ending - (there is no any dry eye in the cinema). Despite that, the movie was good. The war scenes - briliant. An officer shooting the soldiers tring to scape by jumping in the ice-cold Moscau river. The polit-officers shooting the soldiers trying to retreat. The german aviation on a raid over the river or the city. Stalingrad was a city of industry without any fortifications. Sometimes the distance between german and soviet troops was less then 20 meters (about 7 feet). There were no any war manoevers in the movie and Stalingrad is actually the point break for the germans. That's where they actually start losing the war. No one really thought that the winter invasion would bo so prolonged. Anyway the movie is not about the siege, it's about the two snipers. The acting - Feins, Law, Harris - briliant as usual. Hm, by the way - major Kionig says to a german soldier about a POW: ""I hope he is still able to talk!""- nice, compassion to the courageous enemy. He suffers also his son, died in battle. But in the end he doesn't have any remorse when he decides to hang a little kid, when the information he got from the same kid served him very well. Strange, right? Anyway. Briliant camera work, great acting, good story (although nothing to do with reality and history) - so enjoy it:)) I did.",,Anonymous,History
Good but flawed,"This movie is very well made.Well written, good actors, convincing set design, costumes and cinematography.But it has a major flaw.It is not Russian. It doesn't feel Russian. The main reason is language.The actors are well cast and all of them could pass for Russians, but the way they act and deliver lines is utterly non-Russian.The same thing with Doctor Zhivago and The Beast of War, for example.All very good movies and worth watching, but fake.For West-European and American audiences they're probably OK, and actually that's their target audience. But for Slavic and Eastern European peoples - they feel fake. Not to speak for the Russians themselves.So, in my opinion, these kind of movies are a waste of money.The right way for Hollywood would be to make a co-production, with entirely Russian (or other) cast, and preferably Russian (or other native) over-the-line crew - writer(s), director, set designers, cinematographer.Something more in the Mel Gibson way.Nevertheless, such movies are a way for western audiences to get acquainted with other cultures, events and history.In overall - a good watch: 9\10.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Enemy at the Gates: Can equality be achieved?,"Autumn 1942, under the command of Adolf Hitler, the 3rd Reich is at the height of its power rolling through Europe like a mighty wave of death and destruction. The German offensive has pushed deep into Russia with only the city of Stalingrad left standing in resistance. As Enemy at the Gates begins we are thrown into the chaotic battlefield at Stalingrad on the Volga where the fate of the world is being decided. German air bombings have pummeled Stalingrad to an unrecognizable heap of ruins but the Russians refuse to surrender, their commanding officers are driven by a manic devotion (shooting their own men for deserting) to protecting the motherland and the cause of communism. With morale and hope nearing complete extinction; the Russian army is in desperate need of a catalyst to resurrect nationalistic fervor and pride. Enter Vasilli Zaitsev, (Jude Law) a common foot soldier from rural Russia, who arrives at Stalingrad and unleashes merciless, pin-point precision with the sniper rifle. Witnessing Zaitsev eliminate five German officers in rapid procession, military journalist Danilov has found the hero that will provide hope to a despondent, beleaguered nation. Danilov, proclaims, ""Here, the men's only choice is between German bullets and ours. But there's another way. The way of courage. The way of love of the Motherland. We must publish the army newspaper again. We must tell magnificent stories, stories that extol sacrifice, bravery. We must make them believe in the victory. We must give them hope, pride, a desire to fight. Yes... we need to make examples. But examples to follow, like Vasilli Zaitsev"". Over-night Zaitsev is transformed into a national hero, his face on every newspaper, with every kill his legend grows. Despite his success, Zaitsev is uncomfortable in the spotlight and begs that Danilov tones down the hyperbolic articles he writes. In response to Zaitsev's rising success, the Germans call in their most prolific sniper, Major Konig (Ed Harris) to eliminate Zaitsev. An elaborate, tactful game of cat and mouse ensues between the two snipers which is highly suspenseful and entertaining. I'm not going to divulge the outcome, I will leave it up to you to discover on your own, but in my opinion the movie is definitely worth watching!Communist ideology, namely equality lies subversively and furtively at the core of Enemy at that Gates. Zaitsev epitomizes the strive for equality throughout the film, at one point he tells Daniliov, ""I'm not the only one fighting"" , to which Danilov replies, ""You're right the worker in the coal mine is just as important to the cause as you"". Communism strives for complete equality throughout society no individual is greater than the other; everyone must serve the greater good of society. As the communist adage goes, ""Each according to his abilities, each according to his needs"", everyone plays a major role in achieving equality. By eliminating private property, and personal wealth, communism purports that it's possible to create a utopia on Earth. Most would agree that pursuit of communism seems relatively pure and worthy, but under closer scrutiny, a major fault is revealed that inhibits perfect equality. There is a fundamental flaw in the human condition that is the antithesis of equality, that defect can be summarized as sin. No matter how earnest man strives, man is tied down by an anchor of sin which drags and halts the pursuit of equality. At the zenith of the film, Danilov has an epiphany and realizes the futility of communist ideology, ""I've been such a fool, Vassili. Man will always be a man. There is no new man. We tried so hard to create a society that was equal, where there'd be nothing to envy your neighbor. But there's always something to envy. A smile, a friendship, something you don't have and want to appropriate. In this world, even a Soviet one, there will always be rich and poor. Rich in gifts, poor in gifts. Rich in love, poor in love. Man will always have a universal longing for something more that this world cannot offer. To Danilov I would say I agree with your assessment about the human condition, but I would offer him an alternative option. The only way man can transcend his depraved condition, and break the power of sin, is to begin a personal relationship with the creator of the Universe. By throwing God out of the equation, communism eliminated the supreme standard of perfection and equality. God made the ultimate sacrifice by sending His son Jesus, as a sacrifice and remedy to our sins. You might shriek at the mention of religion, but I'm not talking about formalized religion, I'm talking about entering into a relationship with Jesus. Every man-made philosophy on life is faulty; we can never try hard enough or be good enough sin will always get in the way. When accept that we are sinners and believe that Christ's sacrifice cleansed us of our depraved conditions we become new creations. A follower of Christ is not perfect but they are changed and are on a journey to be more like Christ. In this life, utopia will never occur, but true followers of Christ become lights in a dark world spreading the good news and hope of eternal life that lies within them.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"A tale of conflict, love and betrayal","Enemy at the Gates (2001) Reviewed by Martin Davis. Retrospect Film on Facebook. Stalingrad 1942. The Third Reich have swept through Europe and deep into the heart of Mother Russia. The Red Army and Hitler's troops are engaged in bitter hand to hand combat amidst the ruins of the city. Director Jean-Jacques Annaud's World War II epic opens with an uncompromising depiction of the brutality of war as hundreds of newly arrived Russian soldiers attempt a near suicidal mission to cross the Volga into Stalingrad. Under heavy land and aerial bombardment, any man attempting desertion is shot down with a bullet from a Soviet officers pistol. Finding themselves isolated amongst the fallen bodies of their comrades, Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law) and Commisar Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) make good their escape after Vassili demonstrates his impressive marksmanship skills with a rifle. Meanwhile, future Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev (Bob Hoskins) has arrived in Stalingrad and demands ideas to improve the peoples battered morale. Danilov, now a Senior Lieutenant, starts a propaganda campaign in the army newspaper about Vassili's exploits and the farmers boy from the Ural Mountains, taught to shoot by his Grandfather, is transferred to the sniper division and rapidly becomes a national hero. Having become friends, Vassili and Danilov both begin a romantic involvement with a girl from Stalingrad, Tania (Rachel Weisz) a Private in the local militia. With the Soviet snipers increasingly gaining the upper hand on their German counterparts, Major Erwin König (Ed Harris) is sent in to take out Vassili and crush the Russian peoples spirit. So begins a deadly game of cat and mouse. The two protagonists are polar opposites. One, the shepherd boy with a steady hand and a sharp eye but with increasing doubts as to whether he can defeat his enemy. The other, the aristocratic German, supremely confident and equally adept with a snipers rifle. Vassili and Tania have meanwhile fallen in love and driven by jealousy Danilov attempts to discredit his friend to his superiors, resulting in fatal consequences. Based on the 1973 non fiction book 'Enemy at the Gates – The Battle for Stalingrad' by William Craig, the film is a brilliantly told tale of conflict, love and betrayal and succeeds as not just a war film but also as an historical drama and love story.

"A brilliant war film, but not much else","An excellent war film, and at the times when it depicts the battles against the Germans it is brilliant and absorbs you in the moment. Also the brutality of the Russian commissars against their own men is fantastically portrayed. This movie influenced the first Call of Duty game in the way that Saving Private Ryan did for Medal of Honor. However some aspects of the plot are too Hollywood, such as the romance between Law and Weisz which I find completely out-of-place in a film such as this, particularly how she is always so well kept. Plus the bunker they hide in is far too well stocked, what happened to living in sewers and eating rats? One of the reasons the Battle of Satlingrad is so infamous. Once the film moves into the second half, the two snipers seem to almost forget they are in the middle of the greatest battle of all time, and the story becomes a bit too self-centred. To conclude it is an excellent, authentic war film, but the plot is too blockbuster, and thus loses some of its realism.",6.0,Anonymous,History

an opportunity missed,"I needed to see this film twice before I felt that I could comment. In my view this was definitely an opportunity missed. Setting aside the historical inaccuracies thrust upon us by the film industry and the strange need for the story to have a love-interest, I still enjoyed the presentation. Uniforms and equipment were excellent, even a purist like myself would excuse the T34/85's used. The action sequences were, for the most part, excellent if not foreshortened. Having built that superb set and with all the necessary in place, I find it so hard to believe that action sequences properly reflecting the harshness and bestial nature of Stalingrad could not have been on view. I must confess to being less than impressed with the digital effects used to show the bombing raids. On my first viewing I felt the film had been greatly miscast. Of all the main actors on view only the german major seemed right. Second and subsequent viewings mellowed my views but I still feel that there were others out there better suited to the characters portrayed. Certainly Bob Hoskins seemed to be out of place. The thing that , in my view, confines this film to the also-ran pile rather than placed it as one of the all-time great action films was the final showdown between the snipers. During the actual battle a political officer did indeed expose himself to draw the snipers fire [a finger, no more] and the thought that Danilov would do so without any warning to Zaitsev, to allow him to profit properly from teh revelation of position, was stupid to say the least. That the German Major would conduct himself with total professionalism throughout and then finally walk through an open area, failing to spot a man stood exposed at the front of a railway engine beggared belief. In short, the ingredients for one of the greatest war films ever made were undoubtedly available. The opportunity to do so was lost for avoidable reasons.",7.0,Anonymous,History

From my own limited reading about the German attempt to subdue Russia and the pivotal, drawn out battle for Stalingrad I can see why many of the comments from Russian viewers are so scathing and why they are so angry at the contemptuous way the film makers have ignored the tragic history in favour of a two dimensional war/love story.Read the comments with the filter set to ""hated it"" and you will see what a crime against history those involved in making this film have committed.

I have not much to snipe about (groan) in this enjoyable WWII flick,"Based on truth (I wonder how much) this tall recounts the story of a Russian sniper, Zaitsev (Jude Law) defending Stalingrad against the German incursion. His exploits are promoted by his good friend Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), making him a hero for all people. But now he faces his greatest challenge against the superb German sniper Konig (Ed Harris). Can he outwit him? Ta-dum!One of the complaints levelled at this movie was the casting of Jude Law. Jude Law has very aristocratic features - high chiselled features and so on. Here we were meant to believe he was a simple peasant. Well he actually does this fairly well through a judicious use of grime and ragged garments. Ed Harris is always decent playing quiet, stoic characters - which is exactly what's required here. Fiennes does. enough here. His character isn't up to much, beyond trying to be jealous that Law's character gets the boring romantic interest that he cannot (played in an unmemorable fashion by Rachel Weisz).Script? Pah. There's no real one liners. The characters are generally thinly drawn and one line throwaways (we learn nothing about Konig for example, beyond the hardened killer patriot role). There's a certain predictability in that, seeing as it's based on real events, you know some characters will not make it unto the end and one, in particular, surprise moment (although not a twist - the movie has no need of those). Only Law's character generates any real sympathy with the audience, but that's okay because..The directing and cinematography here are very good and that's essential in a war movie. There isn't the grittiness of say `Saving Private Ryan' or the beautiful photography of `The Thin Red Line' (or some of the Vietnam movies). However it doesn't have the blandness that was `We Were Soldiers'. The initial battle scenes are quite striking - bombs, and so forth. No, they're not original but they do have enough scope and epic visceral qualities that I was sufficiently dragged into the old `horror of war' cliché. The later sniping scenes are also done very well. By the nature of the stillness of the sniper - shown from the very opening - we have a claustrophobic tense scene. A bullet can come out of nowhere, a single signature of death. This is quite different from the usual hail of lead we get in movies and definitely adds to the atmosphere. One of the latter scenes, where Law and Harris battle it out, has extra value because every move is a calculation a game, and not just a random race against hope. This dance between the two foes is well handled and never feels too protracted, interspersed as it is with events and sense of momentum. It's what adds to the movie being able to distinguish itself from the plethora of other war movies, and that's important.I did have one problem with the movie - a very pointless romantic subplot. Perhaps the producers felt it needed one to balance out the `boys own' feel. They did by introducing an underdeveloped love triangle that feels tacked on, and only necessary to try and force some movement between Law and Fiennes' characters. Boring. Even worse than being boring it detracts from the otherwise enjoyable story of Law as a sniper and reluctant hero. Oh I guess they must appeal their demographics then.`Enemy at the Gates' doesn't have the power of some of the great movies but it does have a nice streak of individuality, via the concept of focusing on the sniper. There's enough good work done in the technical aspects to make up for the weak characters and script and it's a good one to view on a decent screen and sound system. Not a must but  certainly catch it if it's on. 7.3/10.",,Anonymous,History
A highly fictionalized but very well made war flick,"Enemy at the Gates is a unique movie in the modern war genre. Whereas other more realistic war films from the 90's and early 2000's like Saving Private Ryan and Black Hawk Down depict war and combat with horrifying and graphic detail, they don't really have much of a narrative or story to tell. BHD features no memorable characters or story, but is a technical masterpiece on a purely mechanical level, and is mostly a 2 hour long, step by step battle. SPR has a narrative but the story itself is completely overshadowed by the very long battles, particularly at the beginning and ending. These two films were memorable for their historical accuracy and realism, but as for narrative and story and well written characters there's not much going on. For those who study history or serve in the military, BHD and SPR were great, but as narratives telling a story to an audience, they fell shortEnemy at the Gates has blood and gore, but these are short shots of the camera and are not nearly as traumatic for the audience. EATG has memorable characters with story arcs, whether its the Russian sniper, the German sniper, Danilov, the female love interest, or the boy and his mother. So the film on purpose sacrifices realism and an on the ground, ""as if you were there"" experience in exchange for a narrative. A story driven war experience. Is it as accurate and realistic as the other two films? Absolutely not. But what it does have is character development, rivalry, romance, and political and historical context. Instead of a minute by minute battle which lasts half the movie, EATG portrays war while simultaneously telling a good old fashioned story and the viewer comes away with at least a rudimentary understanding of the Soviet Union and the battle of Stalingrad.There are a few similarities and themes common to both Enemy at the Gates and Seven Years in Tibet. Both have the same director and are loosely based on real events, and both have war, romance, foreign countries and cultures, and both are english language with minimal subtitles.",9.0,Anonymous,History

"Pretty good film, disregard the historical inaccuracies","Well, the film should be viewed as a war drama instead of a historical documentary. The acting is quite good, the plot is nice and the battles shown now and then are not bad. The game series ""Call Of Duty"" has borrowed a lot of the battle scenes actually, like the one at the beginning of the film is played out in ""Call of Duty I"" and the scene where Zaitshev takes his first sniping kill is played out in ""Call of Duty: World At War"". The film has basically two plots: one is the love triangle evolving between the sniper, the commissar and the girl, the other is the competition between Zhaitsev and the German sniper. I very much enjoyed watching the film several times. It's a good and enjoyable drama. A lot of people will say that it is historically inaccurate, and it is, but if you disregard these, you have in your hands a pretty good film.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Solid entertainment,"This is a good film.  I've read many reviews which feel the romantic part of the story detracted from the overall film, but I disagree.  I felt it made a nice balance for the rest of the film, which is excellent but pretty stark and depressing (how else can you describe the battle of Stalingrad?) The actors all do fair to good work, with the exception of Ed Harris, who is outstanding as the blue-blooded German officer sent to kill Jude Law.  His performance proves yet again that you don't have to have to use a lot of dialogue to make an impression or convey the essence of a character. Overall I found this film visually outstanding and well directed.  It is also really nice to see a film about WWII that doesn't involve Americans.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Somewhat forced blend of history and Hollywood,"Enemy At The Gates initially reminded me of a lot of other films; three which spring directly to mind being Saving Private Ryan for the grueling slaughter of almost helpless troops in the opening ten minutes, Shot Through The Heart for the opposing snipers theme, and Full Metal Jacket for the tension of urban close-quarters combat. This is not a historical document on the battle of Stalingrad, nor does it pretend to be, though the events depicted are, by and large, historically accurate, down to the character of the Russian sniper Zaitsev (Law). It should be noted, however, that the central character Zaitsev was by no means the only sniper of note at Stalingrad, and while some Soviet sources claim the duel with Koenig (Harris) actually occurred, this is not widely accepted, as no reports from the period make mention of it. Overall, I found the film gripping and entertaining as the relationship between Vassili Zaitsev, a conscript who finds himself used as a propaganda tool due to his skill as a sniper, and Danilov (Fiennes), the political officer who acts as his ""agent"", develops. The mutual love interest Tania (Weisz) acts as a catalyst to the rivalry as Zaitsev comes to resent Danilov making political capital of him, which justifies the presence of the, presumably, historically inaccurate romance in the film. While a number of points jarred about the film, the accuracy of the uniforms, equipment, and vehicles is commendable from the point of view of a military history buff like myself. The actors do a fine job overall, and a number of the performances were refreshingly out of character - Law is distinctly rough around the edges for a change, and Bob Hoskins is almost unrecognizable as Nikita Kruchschev. However, both Harris and Fiennes leave an annoying amount of ambivalence as to the motivations and psychological makeup of their characters. A flaw in scripting of Zaitsev is his sudden hate towards Koenig at the end, despite the fact that Koenig has been picking of his comrades for the best part of the film. Also, given the carnage inflicted upon the troops on both sides and the civilians stuck in the middle, there is marked lack on the part of all characters of revulsion and resentment for the fact their political leaders are putting them through the meat grinder.

A real life drama,"If you are looking for a lot of explosive action look else where. If you are looking for a great historical story this is great.

"Very, Very, Good...","For the next twenty years, every war (or anti war, I guess) movie will be compared to 'Saving Private Ryan' and not without just cause.  SPR is a fantastic movie, delivers a wonderful message, and almost singlehandedly rekindled this country's pride in our WWII veterans.  Unfortunately, that also means that excellent movies like this one will be compared and if they do not deliver the same earth-shattering impact that SPR did, they will suffer for it.I waited for the DVD of this movie and am glad I did.  With my family neatly tucked into bed, headphones on so I could listen at a respectable volume, on a 36"" TV, I think I got as good a show as any I could have gotten from a theater.  At least there wasn't some moron behind me talking.  The story is as intense as any I have ever seen, the acting wonderful, and the scenery so authentic looking, I think it may even surpass that other movie.  The JU88's and Stuka's used in the film were all of course computer generated, but were used sparingly enough that I didn't even bother to look for flaws, but they did look grand for the time I did see them.]Oh, and BTW, Ed Harris is one of the two greatest actors alive today.

"Good, but the HUMAN ELEMENT IS WEAK and unconvincing","Saw ""Enemy at the Gates"". Huge production and realistic, and it's well worth seeing. But there are some flaws, and a Khruschev who looks way too old for 1942 isn't a major one (Bob Hoskins is great in the role, though).This very good film has two significant flaws, and the intrusive cockney English accents, especially of Jude Law, is one. It is most distracting. It was very foolish of the director to permit this, or maybe it was his dumb idea. Russians speaking with cockney accents! Jeez. Maybe it'll go over well in the East End of London.The other flaw is that one cannot get emotionally involved with any character, or at least I did not. I didn't care about the love story either. Also, the winner of the sniper duel used trickery courtesy of the suicide of his cohort, and I didn't care much for that either. (No names! No spoilers!).Having read the book long ago I know the denouement of that duel, but even those who didn't know may not get emotionally involved in the human element of the film. Perhaps it had something to do with both sides being despicable totalitarian regimes. I'm supposed to really care that one minor cog of a murderous despotism run by a madman killed a minor cog of a different murderous despotism run by a second madman? Also, somehow the acting didn't do the job nor transmit the right emotion, vulnerability, and desperation.The attempts to humanize, and then demonize, Major Koenig towards the end of the film seemed forced and didn't work for me. Ed Harris is a fine actor, but even his character was not fully realized and somewhat two-dimensional.But nonetheless, a very good film, but it won't be entering my DVD collection unless I see it in the ""under $14"" bin.Go see it, but you may not come away really empathetic with the characters.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Friends are enemy's at the gates,"Enemy at the gates is a dramatic WWII story of a Russian sniper and journalist and how they become friends and attempt to survive the war against the attacking Nazi war machine. But after the boys survive a massive German attack they make their way back to the base the journalist writes the story of the sniper and he becomes a hero of Stalingrad. Once the sniper becomes an icon he is used as propaganda just as much as he is a weapon of war.The story takes place in Stalingrad in Russia 1942 our main characters are Vassili the sniper commissar Danilov the journalist Major Konig the Nazi sniper and Tania the female sniper. The movie takes place in multiple places throughout Stalingrad.Jude law the man who Vassili did a phenomenal job just like the rest of the actors ED Harris (major Konig) Rachel weisz (Tania) and Joseph Fiennes (commissar Danilov) all did a fantastic job really pulled me into the film and got me invested.I have an overall interest in WWII history and I love to see it brought to life on the big screen. Especially since it is a representation of real events. If you have an interest in this type of film you will be invested into every second of every scene.One thing everyone needs to realize when watching a film like this is how the people effected felt, how it changed every aspect of their life. But during all of that you have to keep moving on and stay alive and moving.I would recommend this movie for someone looking for a history lesson on something they don't teach much of in school, I would give it a rated R rating because it has sensitive but it is well worth the watch.I could give it a B+ or an A it is a really good movie.I am Jordan Zimmerman and I'm a senior in high school, I'm working as a cook in a bar I love WWII history and continue to study the subject.",9.0,Anonymous,History

The best war movie I've seen in the last few years.,"The actual reason I went to see ""Enemy at the Gates"", was because of a friend who is a fanatical J.R.R Tolkien fan and wanted to see the ""Lord of the Rings"" trailer which he knew was going to be played before the movie. As for the movie itself, I had heard it being described in the Media as an interesting example of how European productions can be as spectacular as American ones, but I had no real urge to see it, as I am not a war movie fan, and furthermore, knowing the history of the Second World War quite well, I feel a certain sadness when viewing a recreation of scenes of death and drama that have actually taken place. Still, I have come to admire Jean-Jacques Annaud after watching ""The Name of the Rose"" but mostly for his less famous film ""The Bear"", which I saw as a child and had moved me deeply. Moreover, a cast including actors like Jude Law, Joseph Fiennes, Bob Hoskins, and mostly, Ed Harris, seemed to guarantee that the film wasn't going to be a flop.I actually found the movie very good. The characters were well-structured and interesting, the performances of the actors were very good, with Ed Harris being an excellent, awe-inspiring figure as the German sniper, the scenery was impressive, the war scenes were few but spectacular and realistic, and the scenes of the sniper duels were undoubtedly the most exciting of the movie. Still, for some reason, many people, including most of those that posted in this column, didn't seem to have liked the movie.Concerning the love story, I must agree that it was a little naive and perhaps at some points became tiring, but it never was annoying and it was stressed just enough to give a romantic feeling without overwhelming the movie's war element at any point. All in all, I found it necessary for the movie's completeness. Concerning historical accuracy, the real events were widely distorted, of course, but it is this slight distortion of history that separates a good war movie from a bad documentary. As for the language issue, with the Russians talking with British accents, a fact which many people found annoying, it did seem awkward in some points, as my friend commented during the movie, but I think it was a right choice on behalf of Annaud. The story was mainly told from the Soviet side, and if the central characters spoke subtitled Russian it would be too alienating and tiring, while if they spoke English with Russian accents it would be too cheap and silly, reminding us of naive American action movies like ""Rambo"". In fact, Jude Law's English-farm-boy accent was very fitting with Vassili Zaitsev's Soviet-country-boy character, while Joseph Fiennes' accent was very fitting to the low-class intellectual he was impersonating. After all, don't forget that the more decent movies featuring Soviets as the main characters, like ""Gorky Park"" or ""Hunt of the Red October"", have them speaking with British accents. As for commissar Danilov's final acceptance of the imperfection of the socialist system, which many people saw as a hint against communism, I find it a simple and fair acknowledgment of the fact that Stalin (and his various successors) was no better than Hitler.The violence and killing in ""Enemy at the Gates"" were realistic and dramatic without being disgusting and aiming in shocking the spectator through sheer brutality as in ""Saving Private Ryan"". Furthermore, although both movies view the Germans as the villains of the story, Annaud's characters are deeper and more human, as he shows that both camps had good people as well as evil people, focusing on the drama of war, as opposed to Spielberg's intolerable approach of presenting the Germans as a swarm of brutal and mindless monsters, something close to the Indians in the mid-war westerns or the aliens of ""Independence Day"". In short, I found ""Enemy at the Gates"" not only a worthwhile European production, but the best war movie of the last few years and one of the finest World War II-theme war films ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Who cares about total historical details accuracy ?,"To answer to dannykip, maybe the officers did not shoot their retreating men as is shown in the film but it has happened more than one time. Please read the book of Rodric BRAITHWAITE ""Moscou, 1941, a city and its people at war"". he talks about this at length. And the fact that they did not have a rifle for each man is also documented in this book. Maybe it was true of 1941 and not of 1942-1943 (the events shown in the film), but what was important to do was to show the spirit of what happened on the Russian front and in the ranks of the Red Army. Art (here, movies) has the right to not be totally accurate in its performances. It is not a documentary. If you wish to see a documentary, there are plenty ! I am quite astonished to see the narrow-minded viewpoints (not talking about you dannykip) shown by amateur critics sometimes. By the way, I think there are too many critics and not enough viewers !Enjoy a movie or do not enjoy it, but please do not try to become an expert in movies critics.

Could it be boring???,"For a movie that has as much action as does Enemy at the Gates, in the end it's, well, boring.The actual battle of Stalingrad was epic and tragic. Historically all the elements for a powerful film exist. This movie almost starts to tell that story and then sadly slogs its way through battle scenes and over drama burdened by an odd love story/triangle that sorely lacks any kind of chemistry or interest. The result is like an odd mix of Sergeant York meets Rambo filled with Russians who have British accents.It's a shame because with an incredible cast like Jude Law, Ralph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz, Bob Hoskins and the always intense/powerful Ed Harris this should have been a home run. It's hard to tell if there's just not enough story to tell or the story to tell is poorly done. The acting is fine but goes nowhere.

An ok war flick,"Having seen war movies like Saving Private Ryan, I have high expectations when going to see this in the cinemas.  There are both good and bad parts about this film.  I would have to say that the best part is in the beginning.  Why?  Because to me this is the most realistic and exciting part in the whole film.  Seeing the Soviet soldiers ferried across the Volga under the watchful eyes of the NKVD and continuous strafes by German Stukas kept me off my seat during the first 30 minutes.  This is the highlight of the film and what follows pale in comparison.  This movie is largely about a duel between two snipers.  While this is interesting at first, it gets boring for me very quickly as we see the same kind of sniper action again and again except in different locations.  The only thing that appealed to me during this phase of the film is when the sniper's spotter got hit in the head mid-air while leaping to another building.  Other than that, the rest is VERY boring.  Also, it would be nice if the film gave more insight as to why the Germans lost the battle, like the poor preparation to General Winter and the atrocities committed against Russian citizens which gave rise to resistance.  Only showing the sniper duels in the battle of Stalingrad was not enough for me, and this also gives an awkward resolution to the film.",8.0,Anonymous,History
I have seen it at the berlin festival. It shows the brutality of war.,"I have seen it at the berlin festival. It shows the brutality and absolute hopeless situation of the russian army at war in Stalingrad. It has strong pictures. It certainly is interesting to see how the american audience will react on this new information: that other nation have fought Hitler as well as america! With greater losses and more sufferings! The film got some stupid critics. Some people seem to think a film is worse if it costs money. This is not the case. A film should try to earn his investment and make profit, if possible. Small money is money too, and some countries support an industry that doesn´t even try to earn its cost´s on the market. It is a well made film. Wolf Kruegers and Neil Lamonts art work is impressive. They did get war on the screen! My problem with this film is the reduction on 2 snipers. I would have been interested to see more about the living situation of the opponents. Even if it is a true story, is it possible to reduce all moral and ethnic terms on who shoots better ? Sorry for my bad english. Toni",8.0,Anonymous,History
Sort of good.,"The last war movie I saw was `Saving Private Ryan' and although it was an excellent movie I wasn't sure if I wanted to see another one. For anyone who has seen a war movie, you have to admit that they can be a bit depressing, especially the more real they are. Enemy at the Gates is based on a real person, which means that a certain amount of the events are real or based on similar events. And knowing this, some of the things I saw definitely fell within the emotional category of depressing.Enemy at the Gates is based on the life of Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law), a young Russian soldier in the sniper division. The movie focuses on Vassili's time in the war and his rise to heroism as Russian papers detail his heroic feats as a special divisions sniper. As the war progresses and as Vassili gains notoriety, he begins to draw the attention of the German high command. To put a stop to this, the Germans send in their top sniper, Major Koenig (Ed Harris) to deal with Vassili.I'm not usually a stickler about movie consistencies but there were some that were quite noticeable. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this movie but the story was about the Germans trying to overtake Stalingrad so the characters are all either German or Russian. Hence it reasons to believe that there should be German and Russian accents. I don't really mind if the accents are off as long as the attempt was made to be somewhat authentic but instead, most of the characters either had British or American accents and when watching the movie, I had a hard time getting really into it. In addition to this, there was one point where we see Vassili writing a letter to some of his supporters, which in itself is fine but we see him being told how to spell a word by Joseph Fiennes character, Commander Danilov and he spells out the word in English. Maybe I'm getting picky but this seemed quite obvious and odd to me in the context of the scene and the overall movie. Little things like these took away from the authenticity of the movie and overall enjoyment level. On another note, some of the dialogue was a bit cliché ridden and in some situations seemed to be added for drama and Hollywood sake.The acting was quite well done, especially Ed Harris's character. The one knock I have (not against him but the direction of his character) is that the end scene with Commander Koenig and the little boy, Sasha, seemed completely out of line with the character we're given up to that point. But maybe that was the point the director was trying to make. I quite enjoyed Jude Law's performance. I haven't seen many of his films but I enjoyed this one. I really enjoyed the sniper scenes. Unlike many war movies where directors feel that it's necessary to have lots of movement and action (which is a natural part of war), I really did like the sniper scenes where there was little movement. We're still able to feel the tension that these men feel and the subtleties of being a sniper.Overall, I did like the movie but it could have been better if they paid a bit more attention to the things I mentioned above. But, like I said, maybe I'm just being picky. I'm just a guy who watches a lot of movies so what do I know.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Intense war drama & hide-n-seek between aces!,"My top favorite ""sniper"" movies in the order are, 1) Shooter, 2) Enemy at the gates and 3) American Sniper. I am penning down this review after watching American Sniper. Enemy at the gates and American Sniper both are inspired from real events. The later gains more in its account by critics, despite being similar is maybe because of Clint Eastwood, the respect that he has earned through ages. When it comes to me, Enemy at the gates aces.It is shown how a Soviet sniper coming from a background of being peasant becomes a hero and inspiration for its people in war. It is also shown how a special sniper belonging to German army it's sent to take care of the business of our hero (Soviet sniper). It's shown how his colleague, a new found love interest and a child move into his (Soviet sniper) world during this war.Final verdict: What steals the show is the intense drama and the game of, hide n seek that goes on between the two snipers. It's worth adding to your collection.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Plenty to snipe at,"This film tries to deal with a lot of very big themes: Conflict, Romance, Rivalry, Loyalty, Self sacrifice etc, but unfortunately its elements do not gel and consequently it is a hotchpotch of ideas, poorly developed. Law's childhood experiences are shown in flashback at length then disappear without much relevance to the story, as are the brief mentions of Fiennes Jewishness or his letter rebuking Law among other things. On the other hand some things are hammered in, such as (the impossibly perfect) Rachel Weicz's high intelligence. We need to be told it again and again because we never see it. Fiennes character does somersaults, being at times, loyal then treacherous. I guess there is a point to this, in saying that love makes someone act out of character but it is not well enough developed to be convincing. Likewise the boy Sasha, as written, fails to convince; nor does his briefly appearing mother In the odd scene where she is told her son has gone over to the enemy. I'm guessing the script was trying to make some point here but I just did not get it.Nazis v commies can hardly have been an easy sell. It is hard to deal with the clash of two such unpleasant totalitarian ideologies as these without the movie-goer thinking ""I hope they both lose!"" Obviously the film makers tried to inject as much humanity as possible and probably veers to much into Mills and Boon territory at times (""He was a shepherd boy sniper and she was the intelligent courageous woman he loved!""). Since these days Romance means love making, a sex scene is required and is rather tacky.While I understand that this is a Hollywood fantasy-land (those looking for historical accuracy should look elsewhere) but the set and general atmosphere resembles a PC game. I would not be surprised actually it was made into one. The cityscape is more of a conquered city with a few militants holding out than one at a state of war. Apart from the opening, and a few bombing raids, no real fighting is seen, merely this duel of the rather gentlemanly snipers.Horner's music too is a self conscious effort to sound important, the main theme having more than a hint of Shindler's List about it.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Not a film buff thankfully,"Some war films and certainly the older ones give me the feeling of being on the outside looking in. Maybe because they are so clean, without the blood and guts as with Private Ryan. War itself is ugly but there are the passion and fears of the people involved. This film has it all, and because it focused on a personal battle between two men, it draws you in. The cinemaphotography, music score, tremendous acting keeps the film moving without reflections of why we are all here as with Tom Hanks and his crew. Some criticism of this film is because it tries to be an epic and it falls short. Enjoy the film for what is NOT what you think the film is trying to be.

"An Underrated, Excellent Film","This movie did not get the credit it deserved when it was first released. It should get it's credit now with the DVD. I heartily recommend it to any fan of war movies.It is a rarity amongst World War II movies ... a story told from the Soviet point of view. The Soviets suffered heavily during the war, both from casualties in the face of the Nazi juggernaut and from the stupidity and cruelty of their own leadership. Yet there was great heroism and bravery on the Eastern Front, as there were on the Western, told in perhaps hundreds of films.""Enemy at the Gates"" tells the tale of one Soviet hero, the sniper Vassili Zeitsev. It's an excellent film. It has epic battle sequences, including a terrible flight across the River Volga. It has tension and suspense well fitting the stalking mentality of the sniper. Best of all it has an emotional core surrounding an unlikely hero and the woman who earns his respect.I only gave this film 8 out of 10. Although they did a good job, the main actors Jude Law and Rachel Weisz really didn't play their parts as Russians. Joseph Fiennes and Bob Hoskins (who is superb as Nikita Kruschev) did just that, and Ed Harris played Major Konig as the perfect noble German. But Jude and Rachel didn't quite hit that mark, although other parts of their performances were quite good.Even with those flaws, this is still a very good telling of the Siege of Stalingrad, with sadness and tension and action and emotion.

hard and gritty and grisly,"Since the film is based on true events, the reality of the film is not in question, I consider the first 20 minutes of the film to be the equivalent of the opening scenes of ""Saving Private Ryan"" or the battle scenes in ""We Were Soldiers"". They are hard and gritty and grisly and not for the faint of heart. The pace of the film is quick and steady, and the action builds perfectly, like a well crafted symphony. Fiennes and Law are the perfect halves of the whole, the sniper with the deadly aim and the propagandist with the leader's ear. Hoskins portrayal of Khrushchev gives us an insight to the man he would become, the man who stood in the United Nations pounding his shoe on the podium screaming ""We Will Bury You"". Rachel is a fine actress and performs well in this film, for a part that is totally unnecessary. But without a love story, we would never get the women into a war film. Anyway, violence alone will keep the kids away, or should, and there is a small and very discretely performed sex scene, but it doesn't last long and doesn't show much. Collectible if you enjoy great war films, as this one certainly is.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A battle involving millions comes down to two,"Like many others before me, when this film came out I thought, ""Oh great. Another film to piggyback on the success of 'Saving Private Ryan'."" So I was not very interested in seeing it then, though I was intrigued by Jude Law and Rachel Weisz. After finally viewing it after a few years, I was pleasantly surprised, not only by the human elements in the harsh urban combat environment, but also by the strong supporting cast. Law and Weisz led me to watch it initially, but then seeing that Joseph Fiennes, Ed Harris, Bob Hoskins, and Ron Perlman played roles made me determined to see this film. None of these fine actors chooses his roles lightly. (I admit that some of their films have been sub-par, but not through the fault of the actors themselves.) I tend to like ensemble films with several strong supporting roles, however brief. This one did not disappoint me--fine acting all around.My compliments go also to the director for his attempt to bring the vast scale of the Battle of Stalingrad down to two men hunting each other. His research into the combat tactics of snipers and urban warfare seemed very thorough. Possibly among the books used was a 1999 novel by David L. Robbins called ""War of the Rats,"" a title I highly recommend here to any fan of the film. The book also tracks Zaitsev and a top German sniper (named Thorvald in the novel rather than Konig) through the wastes of the city. To those of you who believe that books are often better than films, I offer one more title for you to browse.I wonder now why I waited so long to see this film. It was an enjoyable experience.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Very Good Movie!!!,"I had heard so many great things about this movie up until last year. So when I saw that it was upcoming on my TV guide, I had to set a recording for it. A few nights after that, I watched it and was blown away! I hadn't seen really good war movie in awhile so it really surprised me.One of the best parts of the movie if not the best part is the plot. It definitely has a cat-and-mouse type of feel to it. To me, the sniper part of it makes the movie that much more exciting. Multiple times I found myself with my mouth wide open due to the suspense. Another thing I really liked was the countinuous amount of tricks each sniper pulls on the other. Whoever thought them up was very clever.If I could complain about anything, it would be the inaccuracy of the character's accents. The main characters are supposed to be Russian, but they all speak with an accent that is clearly British. It just felt like the actors weren't smart enough to realize they were playing Russians and not Brits. Oh well, it's not that important but it took away the Russian culture.Overall, it's a great movie to watch, it even has a fictional love story that incorporates more characters and of course a girl... what kind of movie has a cast that consists 100% of male actors right? I would definitely recommend this to anybody that likes war movies.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A good but not great movie about a seldom seen side of WWII,"Well, what can I say. Not often before have I been both so impressed and so disappointed by a movie at the same time. What ""Enemy at the Gates"" does well, it does extremely well. But I can't help but feel that it could have been a whole lot better.First, the good things: first of all, there's the excellent opening sequence which shows thousands of Soviet soldiers being ferried across the river towards the battle of Stalingrad. They're being shelled by artillery, shot at by Stuka dive bombers, and executed by their own officers if they try to flee. The utter chaos and desperateness of these early scenes rivals those of ""Saving Private Ryan's"" Normandy beach landing. Very well done indeed.The rest of the movie also features some enormously impressive and very tense sniper duels between the Russian hero and his German antagonist. These scenes are easily among the most nail-bitingly suspenseful I've ever seen.For the most part, ""Enemy at the Gates"" is also a very well-made movie. The acting is great (especially by Ed Harris), everything looks very authentic, and the ruins of Stalingrad look very impressive. There are some fairly fake CGI airplanes in a couple of scenes, but that's about the only technical flaw I can think of.What could have been a lot better though is the story. I understand the need to take some liberties with reality in order to make for a more interesting narrative, but the story here feels rather contrived, relying of a lot of coincidences. The ending in particular is a let-down. After so many good scenes, it feels like a huge anti-climax.Also of note is the awkward love story between the hero and a female Russian soldier. It feels out of place, it's very clichéd, and it actually takes up way too much time that could have been better spent on either real character development or more sniper duels.All in all, it's still a very suspenseful and impressive movie, but I can't help but feel that with a bit more work on the story it could have been so much more.**** out of *****",8.0,Anonymous,History
Russian hero of second world war.,"A good war movie based on Vassili, a sniper of Russia who fought against German army, while they were capturing Stalingrad in 1942 at Second world war. Story plot is focused on a love triangle and two snipers, one from Russia and one from Germany. Both were best in their skills. Except movie length which is 2.11 hours long and some middle part is trailing, it is watchable. Rachel Weiz looks gorgeous. War background, sets, costumes, train and war sequences all are brilliant, you could not imagine that it was made for a movie. Sex scene is really hot and lusty.. Vassili ( Jude Law), German Sniper, Major Konig ( Ed Harris) and Danilov ( Joseph Fiennes) all done remarkable acting. So is supporting cast .Overall watchable movie.",7.0,Anonymous,History
so-so,"funny but i wasn't disappointed at all, i expected to see ""typical Russians"" in this movie, and it was full of them... being half Russian, and knowing the history quite well, in the first 10 minutes of the movie, i was laughing, what was than with the passing of the river? 1. they always passed the river at night, in the dark, why would they do it daytime, meanwhile the German bombers can destroy most of them... 2. what's with the weapons??? it's 1942, in the beginning of the war, the Russians had some problems with the weapons (still more than 1 for two soldiers), but in 42, at Stalingrad, nothing like that.... 3. what's with the shooting their own soldiers, in ww2, in the Russian army, there were some troops, behind who there were soldiers with machine guns, not letting them to go back, but these troops were really rare, and 95% of them were criminals from prisons, or soldiers who were court-martialed... 4.at the scene, were zajcev meets all the reporters and stuff, one guy in the background is simply steeling food from the table, just for the record, if somebody is brave enough to try it, and then caught, well he would be the one in the troops, i wrote in point 3 (if he is lucky...) 5. why in American movies Russians always dance and drink.... the soldiers back at the base, at the end of the day, they dance and sang, and so on..... this is nonsense, they had as little food and energy, that they could not do things like that, and anyway why would they celebrate???? (at the end it's OK :d)and that's just the beginning... really a lot of historical failures, one more, really bad one: what's all that lipstick on her in war and battle???in general, if you don't know anything about history, quite watchable, for me mainly because of Ed Harris...5/10",5.0,Anonymous,History
Far are the days of The Bear and even of Quest for Fire...,"In other words, Brits on skids...Jokes aside, this one is a good if not flawless war movie. The producers call it mystery-thriller. I still call it war movie, since there is no mystery in who is who in this one.But what in Heavens, has this movie to do with the Battle at Stalingrad? Stalingrad is just a poor excuse to rehash the war genre. Even though the story bases itself on historic figures, it is rather superficial in scope.What really bothered me though, was this very pronounced British accent in Russian uniforms! And Hoskins as Kruschchev is simply ridiculous! Especially when he tries to emulate a Russian accent with Cockney undertones. What is London? A suburb of Stalingrad? I appreciate his immense effort, but still he does not possess the stamina to play the, much younger then, and more energetic Nikita Kruschchev (I can see him as Beria anytime...).Acting in general, is good but could be far more greater.The only one who really stands out this time is Ed Harris. He does a magnificent job as a German expert sniper with a casual fatality about the job he has to accomplish (those who are about to die, salute you...).Annaud is not really at his best in this one. Although Stalingrad has been reproduced quite well, Annaud simply makes it an action shooting movie, adding here and there some pathos to help the actors involved getting along with the plot...If you want to watch truly impressive movies about the battle of Stalingrad, then rent or buy the 1992 released ""Stalingrad"" or even better, the 1949 Russian movie ""The battle at Stalingrad"". Both will tell you a lot more about the horrors of war and the mistakes of the Wehrmacht in misjudging its own capabilities, than this wimpy and seemingly intellectual film...Sorry, Jean-Jacques, try harder next time. In the meanwhile, try to enjoy other movies, especially those mentioned before, as well as a German movie on the same subject, called ""Hunde, wollt Ihr Ewig leben?"" (Stalingrad: Dogs, Do You Want to Live Forever?), or the story of the battle, viewed from the German side, with no frills, nor love story. Just the crude reality.",,Anonymous,History
This film got me 130 minutes on the edge of my seat,"I am from Germany (so please be gentle with my english)and i was very intersted seeing a big european movie (a lot of german money  were involved in this production)about the WW2. Stalingrad was a turning point for the war and many people on both sides died a horrible death.This film is truly a anti war movie, showing the the Beast of War with impressive scenes of dying people. The first 10 minutes are a lot like ""Saving Private Ryan"" with excellent music and a bitter and hopeless athmosphere. But you won´t find the bloodthirsty Nazis as hellspawn, you will find cruelty on both sides and the will to live another day.This film is called in Germany ""Duell"" (duel) and that is the leading story here. A russian sniper (Jude Law acting really good) and a perfect cool and blue-eyed Ed Harris as his german counterpart. They play a deadly and very intelligent cat-and-mouse play in between an bombed city.And this is the only point where you could say: ""Hey, this is a lot like a Playstation game (i.e. Medal of Honor) and it looks like a lot of fun."" The killing of nearly 2 million people on either sides is a background theme most of the film.Robert Fraisse handles the camera right for an action movie with a lot of close ups. So, you will get two hours of intense athmosphere and authentic pictures of a war i luckily never saw for myself.The War scenes are not gory, but keep in mind it is a war movie without glorification of the war. So deaths are shown in many ways and when a sniper hits the head of a soldier it is shown with a lot of blood.For the price of your ticket you will get a very good filmed movie with a few special effects (like a bomber squad bombing Stalingrad)and extremely good actors. The love story involved is just a bit emotion, mixed in this man made movie and the happy end not that believable.",8.0,Anonymous,History

"Very intense, but typical Hollywood script.","A really intense and outstanding movie, sadly it has Hollywood written all over it, you are never in doubt of the ending and it all the way through feels sort of predictable, which removes a bit of the intensity, though not all.Vassili Zaitsev is a rookie, raised on the country by his granddad he is send to Stalingrad to fight the most important fight of WW2, there are many soldiers among him, not all are given a rifle, in the first run at the germans Vassili is one of the only survivors from the hit, here he finds a rifle among the dead and snipers 5 german soldiers, watched by a political newspaper guy who turns him into a hero. From Germamy arives the master sniper, König, to put an end to Vasilli's rampage killings of highly placed german officers, the Duell has begun.Enemy At the Gates gives a very good portrait of the war, the evil side too, this has been done many times before, WW2 has and will always be a solid and interesting theme for making movies, the genius lies in picking up a Sub Theme of this that is still interesting, but also original, becuase many things has been seen before, this is a movie that focuses on something that hasn't been made a known movie about before, the Duell between the snipers.This movie is really well done, and you can see that every detail has been gone over and analyzed, this movie is really well put together, sadly the script isn't as well done as the movie itself, from outside the movie sounds very original considering it's a WW2 movie, however once you get going, you can very easily in the movie say that this movie was made in hollywood, the script is predictable, and for some reason it tries to combine the intense WW2 drama, with an intriguing love story. If the love story is true or not, i don't know, but never the less it makes the movie part ways early, intensity moving to one direction, while the romantic side story movies in the opposide direction, the purpose is to cross each others read in the end, and it does, and it's spotted after 30 minutes within the movie, however i must say that the love part of the movie has both it's good sides and bad sides, at first i was annoyed that they had to import a love story into a dramatic and intense war movie. However, it succeeds without destroying the dramatic point of the movie too much, it's more the predictability of the movie that makes for a less intense part here, not saying it's boring, becuase it's so well done that it can only be exhiting, however if i didn't already know that he was bound to survive to safe the happy end, i would have been chewing my nails on every Duell.One of the most amazing parts of this movie is the unbelivable realistic and detailed re-creation of Stalingrad during the war, this is one of the more convincing sides of the movie, and it really makes a good background for a realistic WW2 movie, it's obvious that the scenery has been done down to the very last detail, it looks really outstanding. Also the cinematography of the movie is really great, and the opening scene when they enter Stalingrad from the water is very well done, appears to be a scene inspired by the ""boarding the beach"" scene in Saving Private Ryan, but never the less it looks great and the parts where the planes are gunning at the boats is terrificly made.The directing of this movie is well done, however i wouldn't characterize the directing perfect, as i think any experienced director could have made this movie as it is made, he had all the necesarry funds to build a great re-creation, the fantastic re-creation is not something we should thank the Diretor for, it's nothing extraordinary, but still a good direction.One thing that surprised me in this movie was Jude Law's great acting, i've always seen him as a bit shallow and without debth of realism, but in this movie he really does a great job and makes the movie more belivable, furthermore it's his stone face in the sniping scenes i think that makes for much of the intensity, he's playing a very serious chracter, and he succeds. The other main actors and actresses also does a great job, however they're not shining as much as Jude Law is, he is the one that makes the other performances fade a little to the background.To sum it all up, this is indeed a good movie, at times breathtaking and intense, other times a little hard to understand and too predictable, but it's still a solid movie, good entertainment, and definetely worth checking out if war dramas is a genre that interests you.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,History

In fact reviewers' good part has put a high vote to the previous episodes. Because this contrast? I know the reason. Since assumptive reviewers' good part favorably sees the past and as the past is ""better"" than the present they have given several credit to the preceding episodes being still the last episode more explosive and spectacular.

Highly impressed,"We're coming off a year in which a sandshoe-swordfighting epic is our best picture and the Academy has made some improvements with its selections. Members of the Academy, pay attention. This film stands out as one of the best movies I've seen in a good couple of years, and I won't be surprised if it turns out to be better than Pearl Harbor.What makes this film so riveting is not its dialogue -- rather its atmosphere and the non-verbal emotional roles that the characters play. When is the Academy going to grow some guts and give Ed Harris the recognition and Oscar he deserves? This movie is yet more proof why he stands among the elite (along with Morgan Freeman, I consider him the best actor working in America) because he can take a role with very little speaking and elicit an extremely strong reaction from the audience. This guy will make you hate his character when all is said and done. Jude Law is perfectly cast as our resident hero and counterpart to Harris, and Joseph Fiennes continues to make leaps and bounds in his performances. (I wasn't expecting much out of Fiennes, but his performance as a Soviet propagandist was so breathtaking real it could be considered the show-stealer.) I enjoyed the subtlety of both the romantic sub-plot and Rachel Weisz's performance, and the atmosphere created by the directors leaves your blood running cold.The movie is partially fictionalized, but yet again, truth is not only stranger, but more compelling, than fiction.""Enemy At The Gates"" is more than worth your $9.50. It's certainly not for the light of the stomach -- the sniper violence can be visually shocking and nauseating at times -- but hey, war is war. If you're the type of moviegoer who appreciates subtle action and stories told with emotions, not words, then this one is definitely for you. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,History

Straight to video release at best, although DON'T rent the video, either.

"Mr. Brehznev, you are reading the Olympic Rings.","Movie all in all is good, but too claustrophobic.

The story, interesting though it was, didn't need to be this long in the telling. Performances are good; Hoskins is great as Khrushchev, and Jude Law excellent as the silent hero. Rachel Weisz, Hey Now!  Ed Harris, he's not so good. Gives an uncharacteristically doped performance. He was probably paid by the word. The one thing I do commend is the treatment of the Soviets as protagonist. Just who was a bigger maniac Stalin or Hitler, isn't a question worth contemplating. The film was more than fair in its treatment of the average Red Army soldier. Showing the brutality of the Stalin regime towards its own citizens, especially its military personnel, as the average Vlad lived the Orwellian nightmare firsthand. Stalin sent 2 million of his men to their deaths, yes 2 million, to ensure the city that bore his name did not fall to the Nazis. Huge price, but probably as much as anything, the battle of Stalingrad ended Hitler's aspirations, and made Eastern Europe safe for the subsequent Soviet Cold War occupation.

Beautifully Disturbing,"Like `Saving Private Ryan', `Enemy at the Gates' starts off forcing the viewer to bear witness to some beautifully disturbing battle scenes.  In `Ryan', American soldiers are dying at the hands of the Germans.  In `Enemy', Russian soldiers are dying at the hands of the Germans and Russians, whose twisted idea of human expendability causes them to shoot any soldier who turns back.  By removing the `Ryan'-style rah-rah patriotism in the first fifteen minutes, this movie earns credibility in my book.The storyline begins with Vassily Zaitsev (Jude Law), an adept marksman, saving the lives of himself and Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) by gunning down an unsuspecting group of German officers.  A friendship forms, and Danilov soon after describes Vassily as a Russian hero in the propaganda he authors. Vassily, as a newly promoted sniper, becomes a national icon and draws the attention of the Germans.  Reasonably, they suspect that killing Vassily would demoralize the Russian forces and send their star sniper, Major Koenig, played by famously blue-eyed Ed Harris, to stop Vassily.  The movie becomes an edge-of-the-seat game of cat and mouse and even manages to work in the requisite love story, with Tania (Rachel Weisz) as the interest.Some have been critical of this film because the sniper rivalry is rumored to be fictionalized, and understandably, since the film is a multi-national effort, one would hope for an accurate history lesson in the process.  I am unsure of these criticisms, but I am sure that the film, though long , is a well-done look at an often forgotten war front.  The actors all put in stellar performances, but perhaps Ed Harris, as the cunning and calm German, takes the cake.  Fans of war films based largely on words unsaid like `The Thin Red Line' and `Apocalypse Now' will find this movie more of the bubble gum variety, but this, in my opinion, does not detract from the film's quality.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Not a waste of time,"Well, this won't be my favorite movie.  I wasn't stunned by it; it didn't make me think too hard (aside from asking my military historian husband for some background about the battle involved). But it's a pretty good film. The sniper scenes are tense without feeling dragged-out.  There were some elements that kept me guessing throughout the movie, and I have to confess that some of my cocky assumptions (regarding who would die, mostly) were completely wrong.  There were a few less-than-believable moments (how exactly DID those three or four pieces of glass all manage to line up exactly so that Konig could see Vassili's reflection in all of them?) but nothing to ruin the movie.Overall, this is a good one to watch if you like war movies.  It has no doubt irritated thousands of pacifists who dislike the glorification of the skills it depicts, so don't watch it if you're inclined to gripe about movies that have too much violence or make war look too heroic. Otherwise, give it a try; I doubt you'll be disappointed.Note: I checked to confirm my suspicion that the music was done by James Horner.

Make just one little mistake and you're dead.....,"No, I'm not referring to anything in the storyline, or the cast, characters or the acting - all of these were really quite superb (I thought) and have been very well covered in the other comments I've read, although I did have a tiny little bit of trouble with Bob Hoskins for a while...I'm referring to the technicalities: historical detail, settings, scenery, props, sounds, colour, lighting, camera work, costumes, make-up, weapons and machinery handling - all the things that, if done right, go to make a truly believable and watchable war movie which this most definitely is.I reckon 'modern' war movies have to be the very hardest genre to get right, especially when they refer (as they almost always do) to real events and double especially when survivors of those events are still alive today. Other than, say, real-life biopics, almost any other genre can get away with minor inaccuracies or fudging the details, but with a war movie - make just one little mistake and you're dead. Get it wrong and the whole effort is reduced to farce or parody. A shot of a modern Coke bottle might make a big, effective and intriguing point in a sci-fi film - a similar anachronism in a WW2 film and the whole thing's straight out of the window, in my book.Discounting some dodgy CGI (Stukas), EATG was a visual and audible feast of truly epic proportions which you will not begrudge the time taken to watch it. The story, based on real events, is very well done and is set in a phenomenal landscape, littered with a wholly believable destruction and debris of war on the Eastern Front - well up there with Saving Private Ryan for my money. All in all, a tribute to JJ Annaud's continuing production of superior and highly recommendable films.

"Intense and Meaningful,","Enemy at the Gates is a great movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding cast. It's a very intense war film that has some gritty, truly engrossing moments, however, what this movie does that most do not is that it never forgets about its characters or their relationships. There are never any long battle sequences that drag on to a degree that they have forgotten about the characters and are simply giving us effective visuals, it always remains grounded.It did drag on at certain points, there was certainly some hefty, dialogue based moments that went on far longer than they should have. There was a lot of spoon feeding going on at times when they should have just let the plot move forward and leave us to find out for ourselves.The cast is phenomenal, Jude Law shines in the lead role, keeping our attention and care for his character throughout, as he delivers his performance with a lot of depth, his relationship with Rachel Weisz in the film is also a very sweet and effective one. Ed Harris is also stellar as the lead antagonist, portraying the character with a lot of rage, but also manages to display some humanity to him.It is a rare war movie that never manages to forget its characters.

I am a person that had great hopes for the movie 'the patriot', but was sad to see the Americans win the battle of Gilford Court House. A deviation from the historical records is understandable, but many movies destroy the point history.Everyone should know that the historical record of the sniper dual in enemy at the gates is myth (or a legend). That is not to say that it did not happen, no one really knows. Most of what we know about that day is propaganda. I have read the propaganda on the dual, and I do not think that any sniper would behave as stupidly as this top German sniper. At the same time, I do think that the dual happened. Maybe it did have the strange ending that is shown in the movie. Who knows?Historically, the movie is very accurate (from my knowledge). The crossing of the Volga was done during the day in the movie, but most (if not all) river crossings were done at night. But the results were the same. My friend said that he saw a T-34-85 in the movie. If there was one in there, than it was incorrect. I did not see it. As far as I know, this movie was historically on the money.

Truly one of the great WW II films.,"Because of the titanic significance of WW II to the history of our century and because of the true heroism (in the meaningful sense of the word) shown by so many people who gave their all to defeat this century's antichrist, the moral prerequisite of any film about the subject is authenticity.  We owe it to all those who gave so much to tell their stories as close to the way it was as far as we can determine(not necessarily about real incidents but about what it was like).  Saving Private Ryan earned the accolades of veterans for that reason and Enemy at the Gates follows suit.  `Enemy' adds the extra whollup of biography: there was just such a hero in the battle of Stalingrad.  The producers and directors also get credit for making the contributions of the Russians to winning the war as their subject matter. As some historians have pointed out, this contribution is often overlooked because of the seedy history of Stalinist communism and the chronic, postwar, anticommunistic hysteria of Americans. With that preparation, Annauld gives us a bone-chilling account of the kinds of horrific sacrifices the Russians made. The battle scenes are equally horrific in their realism to those in `Ryan'.  Like `Ryan', it thereby reminds us continuously of the nature of the heroism: that ordinary, peace-loving, sensitive people could apply themselves to this hateful work, contrary to their inclinations and preferences. All the other elements that are required to support this presentation (production values, acting, directing, etc.) are first class in this film. This is one of the all time greats.  See it and be sure your kids see it so they understand what all these people did for them.",9.0,Anonymous,History

A Great WWII Movie,"Note to my fellow history buffs: No movie set during an historical event is 100% accurate, no matter how good it is. Not Saving Private Ryan, not Glory, not Apollo 13, not Gettysburg, not Titanic. Stuff gets condensed, stuff gets left out and some stuff is added on in the interests of drama. Once you can deal with this, you'll not only have a much better time at the movies, you'll also be less likely to annoy the people you go to the movies with. That and you get to have the fun of e-mailing all the little goofs in to IMDB.You know a movie has to be good when the biggest gripes people have about it are the accents. Yes, all the major Russians seemed to have studied at Oxford, and an accent coach would have been nice. And yes, in the many scenes when it's sniper vs. sniper, the huge Russian and German armies seemed to have disappeared completely. Other then that, there was very little to groan about in this movie. Ed Harris had a powerful screen presence, and the major Russian characters played by Jude Law, Joeseph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz played well off each other, even without the benefit of Russian accents.The story is an excellent balance of excitement and suspense. There is an explosive, in-your-face action battle scene which the only half armed Red army gets clobbered in turn by German Stukas, tanks, and machine guns, and tense, uptight sequences where the two expert snipers stalk each other.I'll recommend this for any WWII fan, suspense movie fan, Harris/ Law/ J.Fiennes/ Weisz fan and any movie historian who's starting to get the feeling that Hollywood has been giving a just little too much credit to the US contribution in WWII recently (U-571, Saving Private Ryan).

The film is not worthy of the name,"The creators of this film took one of the best books ever written about the Battle of Stalingrad and butchered it beyond recognition. Sure, the first twenty minutes were excellent, but the rest of the film was a waste of time. Yes, Zaitsev was a real person and the romance did occur, but the book gave this aspect of the battle no more than a page in total.In order to develop this Hollywood-style romance-in-war theme, most of the most fascinating and horrifying elements of the book and the battle itself were omitted from the film. The Italian, Romanian, Hungarian, and most of the main Russian and German personalities in the book were eliminated in order to develop the Russian sniper characters. Gone is the starvation, the images of people freezing to death, the cannibalism, and the real senses of fear, frustration and hopelessness so powerfully evoked in the book. It goes without saying that the horrors of the Axis soldiers' march into captivity and life in the Soviet prison camps were also allowed no place in the movie. The author, William Craig, spent several years traveling through Europe, North America, Australia, and the former Soviet Union to interview survivors of the battle, and it was a shame that almost none of his work was used for this film.Not only is there no mention of the Axis Allied troops so prevalent and important to the book, but the film gives little perspective from the German side. As with most Hollywood films, this movie shows the Germans as no more than one-dimensional, evil characters. The book shows that despite the atrocities committed by many German troops during the war, they were also human beings and some actually behaved as such. Ed Harris is brilliant as usual in his portrayal of the expert German sniper, but the character does not show the human side that the actual soldier showed in the book. They also portray him as committing war crimes in the film that others had actually committed in the book.The film does a pretty decent job of showing the suffering of the Soviet troops and people, while the acting and the opening battle scene are actually really good, which is why it does not get a 1, 2 or 3 rating. The potential was definitely there to create something on par or better than ""Private Ryan,"" but the film's creators chose to do something more like ""Pearl Harbor."" It is no wonder that the film's producers waited until after the author died in order to ruin his vision.I would definitely recommend watching the first twenty minutes if you are a WWII buff or want to see something like the D-Day scene in ""Private Ryan,"" but after that I would only stay tuned if you like love stories and clichéd WWII films. I can only hope that someday someone will decide to make a film that is more faithful to the book, because among World War II books, Enemy at the Gates is one of the few that is worthy of a far better one than this. If you really want to enjoy this movie, maybe it is best not to read the book, that way you will not be as angry and disappointed as I was.",4.0,Anonymous,History
An Epic That Might Have Been,"Ultimately this attempt, though well intentioned, was a disappointment.  I read William Craig's book back in the seventies, in fact it was the first serious book I'd ever read, so when the movie came out, I was eager to see it. Making a movie about the Battle of Stalingrad is an obviously difficult thing to do--much harder than D-Day, or likely any other battle, the scope of the thing is hard to fathom.So, in essence, they didn't film the battle, but rather tried out a metaphorical battle--one between two snipers rather than two massive armies. The first ten or twenty minutes sets some of the stage, but the context is largely left out.  Just the fact that they made a movie about one totalitarian brutal vicious regime in a death struggle with another totalitarian brutal vicious regime is something of a daring task, at least for American audiences--since we, as a rule, don't have much use for totalitarian brutal vicious regimes.  It gives no real hero to root for--they try to make up for this by making Jude Law, the Russian sniper, just a poor rural boy caught up in things he doesn't understand and sets him up against an aristocratic German Nazi who's obviously somewhat gung ho about his work.They also try and make up for the brutal context by adding in an insipid love story that overclouds other very positive elements of the movie.The movie makers should have done a number of things: First they should have watched ""Cross of Iron"" by Sam Peckinpah, the only other western movie I can think of depicting the Soviet-Nazi conflict (the ""eastern front"").  I'm sure there are many movies, just very few that are played in the U.S.  In Cross, they put a number of men in an impossible situation, and don't try and gloss over the nature of the conflict--it just is.The next thing they should have done is rewritten the entire premise--bringing Stalingrad down to just two snipers shooting at each other is an interesting concept, but it undercuts the vastness of the battle; maybe they were trying a metaphor, or some such nonsense, but it seems they just wasted a rather impressive set that could really have depicted the battle with some accuracy.I found it ironic that the Russians spoke in English accents, since, for some reason, as a rule, Nazis seem to speak in English accents in many WWII movies--not a criticism, just an interesting reversal.Any movie about Stalingrad is likely worth seeing, if only because Americans don't usually know much about it, we could benefit from some more info on the subject.  But this movie is so much less than it could have been. Disappointing.",,Anonymous,History
"Good movie, pretty true to history, but...","This movie is one of the better war movies of late, as it is based on an historical event.  Very gritty, very realistic.  As an avid collector of military rifles, I found most guns in the movie to be historically accurate, as were the planes.  But I have one problem.  So many historical dramas recently incorporate a love interest.  While I don't know if Zaitsev had such a love interest, I doubt it.  Like Titanic, the drama of the real life event is more than enough to make a movie good.  The love story just isn't needed.  As for the lovemaking scenes (if you can call such animalistic behavior lovemaking) they weren't romantic, just nauseating.  Still, overall, a great film, strongly recommended!",8.0,Anonymous,History

New perspectives on the WW2,"Most films I've ever seen about the world war 2 has been either from a jolly good Englishman's or a flag wrapped Yankee's eyes. Two exceptions from the past - Das Boot and a movie about the battle of Suomossalmi. Til now. Enemy at the gates shows more than any other film the soldiers destiny - to die from a random bullet. A bullet with no address, just hitting a lung, a heart, a part of someones brain. Just like that. And that in a film which was meant to tell a story about snipers. Furthermore, the film presents Russians as humans, not beasts or machines, and it makes you think. Not that I didn't know before that they really were humans, but I've never had that feeling before that Russians, has suffered just as much as any other people and that we in the west owe them a great deal of respect for helping mankind end the world war 2.",9.0,Anonymous,History
EXCELLENT,"I enjoyed every moment of this movie from the opening scene until the very end.  The suspense and tension was great and the atmosphere of the war was forever present throughout the film.  I felt like I was there as I shared the various locations with the snipers- feeling the cold; laying on the ground, rocks and stubble and waiting anxiously.I also felt I've seen the best fully clothed love scene in my entire life.This movie brought to mind the old Sam Peckinpah war thriller Cross of Iron where the Russians were pitted against the Germans.In summary, another testament to the courage of the men, women and children that battle the invaders of their land and their willingness to die for what they believe in- the salvation of their country.I gave this movie a ten because it deserves it.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Better then expected,"Better then expectedThis was actually a very good movie, but that was not what I expected. After have seen a couple of interviews with Jean-Jacques Annaud - and also after had seen his latest movie with Brad Pitt - I was afraid that he had become to interested in the commercial parts of the movie industry and that the movie would follow standard form 1A...but it didn't.The fact that everybody talks english wasn't at all as annoying as I had expected either. The thing was that it would have been very strange if the movie involved talk between germans and russian and both are screaming in english but they don't understand each other...luckily there is no such talk between the both parties so then it's ok with english.The actors was of varying standard. Jude Law - whom has gotten much criticism for his part wasn't all that bad. Rachel Weiss was worse - can't understand why they screened her. Joseph Fiennes was ok but not more...and Ron Perlman was - not good but contributing to the movie with his presence. Best was Ed Harris as the German nobleman....there was real blue blood in his veins. Bob Hoskins was ok as Khrushchev.The settings was magnificent and the sf/x was good.One annoying thing was the music...James Horner must have some other music than 'Braveheart' and 'Titanic'....sometimes it felt like he had just taken the score from those two movies and added them in this movie. Not good - even thou the music is good it's sad to hear it in all the movies in which he composes the score.All in all. a 9/10One more good thing was that the love part of the movie wasn't as misplaced as it was in Braveheart.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Rattenkrieg: See It!,"There are, in fact, ample historical accounts of the actual existence of Vassili Zaitsev, Heinz Thorvald (Ed Harris' Major Koenig in this film) and a female sniper companion to Zaitsev, Tania Chernova, notwithstanding a previous reviewer's criticism. See Beevor, Chuikov, Werth, there are others, including an account from Zaitsev himself (""Za Volgoi zemli dlia nas ne bylo"": translated, 'For us, there was no land beyond the Volga').  As for ""Enemy At the Gates"", this is a smashing film (pardon the adjective). Substantially accurate, it not only tells the story of the individual contributions of reluctant heroes, but also more broadly depicts an epic battle that concluded by demonstrating to the world that the German Wehrmacht was not invincible, that the Red Army and its civilians not only had absorbed Hitler's best punch but countered it with one of their own, culminating in  Generalfeldmarshall Friedrich von Paulus' surrender of the German Sixth Army and, two years later, the defeat of the Third Reich itself.The setting for this film takes place during a time when the German Wehrmacht had suffered no significant defeats whatsoever.  When von Paulus surrendered his Sixth Army at the end of January, 1943, the price of victory for the Russians, after five months of what the Germans referred to as der kessel, the cauldron, was 750,000 killed.  For the Germans?  Four hundred thousand killed not including another 300,000 of their allies, the Italians, Hungarians and Rumanians.  The civilian population of Stalingrad was reduced from a prewar half million men, women and children to 1500 civilians.The shift of pace and mood between the train ride to the disembarkation site on the east side of the Volga and, following that, the panic of replacements being ferried across the Volga to the charred remains of the city, is comparable to the scenes of the LSTs approaching and landing on Omaha Beach in ""Saving Private Ryan"". The haplessness of new recruits being cast into the fray, only half of them with rifles, to die either by being cut to pieces by the Germans or, if they fled, cut to pieces by Red Army troops in the rear positions at the direction of the political commissars, sets the mood of dispair and terror difficult to imagine without the sophistication of modern film making.  In this sense, special effects are used very effectively to enhance and drive home the chaos and continuous terror of urban warfare.Naturally, the principle point of interest is the ""High Noon"" contest between Major Koenig (Ed Harris) and Zaitsev (Jude Law) and their dance to terminate one another.  This tension, broken only by the love affair between Zaitsev and Tania (Rachel Weisz), should keep anyone who isn't insensate gripped by the developing events leading to Zaitsev's ultimate triumph-that delivered, ultimately, by his ""promoter"" and rival for Tania's affections, Danilov.Minor beef:  The unaccented English throughout was welcome-though, the dialog coaches needed to decide if ""Vassily"" was ""VA-ssily or Va-SSI-ly-First or second syllable stress: ""Shto Eta?""  (Russian pronunciation favors second stress)The German foot soldiers, by the way, privately responded to Hitler's ""Fortress Stalingrad"" designation of the Sixth Army's encirclement at Stalingrad with a label of their own: ""Rattenkrieg""-""War of the Rats""-a more fitting picture of their lice infested, starving existences .  The Russians, of course, faired no better.I enjoyed this film very much, though it is violent and disturbing.  It offers those of us who lived close to those WWII years a poignant reminder that it was a time never so good to us as the times we live in now.  And a wakeup call for the rest of us who think that our comfortable lives are forever a normal feature of a peaceful existence.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Then he showed us a real heroizm of all Russian people who is fighting for his own land, who is together is fighting against one enemy - the Nazis.

So keep in mind, my opinion of this film is of the film's artistic merits, not historical accuracy.Having said this, I loved this film. Ed Harris, Josph Fiennes, Ron Perlman, Racheal Weisz, and especially Jude Law did great acting jobs. The best thing however, is the cinematography and direction of the film.

For instance, when a tank enters an area we see it in a wide shot, then a close up, back again, seamlessly. Never: wide shot of town with no tank, close up of tank entering , etc. Everything looks like it is thoroughly rehearsed, then shot (almost like Children of Men, but obviously not quite like that films genius and originality), rather than : OK, well take a shot of this, then this, then edit it together and bang we got a film.I enjoyed this movie, and would highly recommend it. 8.5 out of ten.(I really wish IMDb would let people give a film a .5 value, rather than just going up b 1's.)",9.0,Anonymous,History
Gripping and gritty war film,"Enemy at the Gates (2001) was co-written and directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud. The movie takes place during the Battle of Stalingrad, and is based on true historical events.Jude Law plays the soldier Vassili Zaitsev, a Russian peasant who has the skills and the bravery to become the chief sniper for the beleaguered Russian army in Stalingrad. Ed Harris is Major König, the German sniper who was sent to Stalingrad to eliminate Vassili. Both actors are excellent in their roles--Law as the intelligent, but unsophisticated, hunter, and Harris as the worldly, arrogant officer who is also an amazing marksman.All Russian military units were accompanied by political commissars. Joseph Fiennes stars as Commisar Danilov, who befriends Vassili, and who is clever enough to recognize the propaganda value of a heroic Russian sniper. Both he and Vassili are in love with soldier Tania Chernova, played by Rachel Weisz. Bob Hoskins does a brilliant job portraying Nikita Khrushchev, whose career was already on the rise during the battle for the city.The Battle of Stalingrad may have been the most important battle in World War II. However, movies about battles belong on the History Channel. As in ""Saving Private Ryan,"" a war movie must involve us in the lives of the men and women who fought it. Vassili's story does, indeed, involve us. We are involved even more than in other war films, because the story is true.The German army, which at one point controlled 90% of Stalingrad, had totally disintegrated by the time the battle was over. Determined Russian resistance and the Russian winter broke Hitler's army the way they broke Napolean's army. In Napolean's case, a tattered remnant of his army struggled back towards France. When the Battle of Stalingrad was over, there wasn't any German army left to return home. Hitler refused to consider retreat, when retreat was still an option. He told the German soldiers to fight to the last man and the last bullet, and that's what they did.I saw this movie on DVD.

"Great movie, perhaps not perfect, but...","there is no such thing as perfection as there is no movie which pleases everybody. I think it is actually much better than Saving Private Ryan. Though of course this one was made with SPR's success in mind. People here are complaining a lot about the accents. I agree, it would have been much more believable if the main parts were played by Russian actors with perfect Russian accent, or even subtitles. But let us face it, this is a big budget production, there is simply no way that unknown in the West actors could have been cast. So they went with familiar European looking faces of Jude Law, Rachel Weizs and Ralph Fiennes. These guys are British and nothing can be done about it. If they faked Russian accent, it would have been utterly ridiculous not only to the Russians, though first of all, to them. They went the natural way, not faking any accent, they all spoke they way they usually do and I respect the director for that decision. This way actors concentrated on acting rather than artificial accent.Somebody accuses this film being a war propaganda. It can not be further from the truth. The war is shown very cruel, bloody, senseless and terrible, it makes us remember the sacrifices made for the peace.I think it is pretty well known that the movie is based on a true story and people still complain about plot not being believable (yes, hanging of a boy and falling asleep on duty really happened, this guys had chronic sleep deprivation, they were under siege). Especially funny is somebody not seeing cleanly shaven Ralph Fiennes during the course of the whole movie. THEY WERE UNDER SIEGE, they did not have opportunity to shave everyday! Besides, the guy is dark haired, he will have five o'clock shadow in couple of hours after shaving anyway. Bottom line is that people seem to divide for those who like to pick on movies and those who come to the theater and take it as it comes, trying to find that movie magic, which is almost in every movie to some extent.The movie ""Enemy At The Gates"" is beautifully done, it has fine cast, interesting plot and characters, and is showing the part of history that is largely disregarded in America.

"Powerful drama, historical, riveting","Based on the true life exploits of a Russian sniper during World War II and the German sniper sent to kill him.  When the Germans start their invasion on the city of Stalingrad, a political officer Danilov, witnesses the incredible shooting skills of another comrade, Vasily Zaitsev,  a young man who was taught by his grandfather to shoot. Over the following months Vasily eliminates many German officers and Danolov uses his exploits to raise moral throughout the Russian Army.  The Germans bring in their own legendary sniper, Major Konig to track him down and eliminate him. What follows is a cat and mouse chase through the rubble of a destroyed city and the emotional struggle to survive. What was memorizing about this movie was the way the film makers drew the audience into the story.  From the outstanding performances to the pacing and the emotional musical score, never were you given a chance to become restless or bored.  Using some filming techniques seen before in Saving Private Ryan, the director really shows the brutality of the conflict between these enemies. The only failing that I would have to say about the movie would be the performers' accents.  All the characters were either Russian or German, yet all the accents were British or American.  Most noticeably was Rachel Weisz. She turns in a fantastic performance but her quite apparent British accent sometimes really distracts one away from the emotional attachment you might have towards the character.

There is no insight into Law's character except for some contrived flashbacks of him shooting a wolf with his granddad and no explanation of how he developed into a sharp- shooter. Even the action scenes are badly directed with little or no tension.Miscast, misdirected and poorly scripted, it left me rooting for the Nazi sniper just to put an end to this whole sorry farrago as he gives the only credible performance in the whole movie. This film doesn't even begin to tell the true story of Stanlingrad or the heroic resistance of the Russian people against Fascism. As for the tacked-on happy ending, this just reveals the whole enterprise for the cynical load of Hollywood dross that it is.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Gripping from beginning to end.,"One of the biggest surprises for me was the epilogue which flashed across the screen.  It said that the film was based on the true life story of Sergeant Vassili Zaitsev.  How much was true and how much sprang from the imagination of the scriptwriter's imagination matters not.  The fact remains it's a war film that's up there with the best.  It's another film about the battle for Stalingrad, and there'll probably be a lot more to in the future, because this event was a turning point in favour of Russia and its allies in WW11.  One can't help but compare this film with the German production ""Stalingrad"" (1993) because both were produced on the grand scale. ""Enemy at the Gates"" is a better production.  I felt more involved as I watched the frightened young Russian soldiers some without guns stumbling on towards the enemy, snatching a rifle from a fallen comrade and charging into the barrage of fire.  The harrowing scenes which followed with bodies lying bleeding in the churned-up mud were heart-rending.  I guess a lot of the set was put together using computer technology.  Some of the distant background looked a bit unreal, but the over-all effect was truly amazing on the giant screen. All the battle scenes were believable as we watched the slaughter of the Russian troops who understandably had lost all hope of victory.  But battles can be won with words as well as guns.  Propaganda can be a powerful weapon. Young Vassili a superior marksman starts to pick off some of the German Officers.  The news (plus the distribution of propaganda pamphlets) starts to spread rapidly among the troops and the general population.  The morale of the Russians starts  to improve as Vassili is painted as a hero.  Jude Law is likeable as Vassili the former shepherd boy now a national hero.  To win the battle for Stalingrad the Germans must destroy this hero worship. Into the scene comes the top Nazi marksman Major Erwin Konig (a splendid role for Ed Harris) whose sole mission is to find and kill Vassili.  The ensuing scenes  are intensely gripping as the opposing marksmen seek each other out amid the ruins of a burnt out department store. I found the display models particularly scary as I wasn't certain whether perhaps they were living beings about to spring, and the glass reflection scene had me almost at breaking point. There is some love interest in the film.  And this was necessary I think to give some relief to the pervading horror of those dreadful days.  The film I thought gave a fairly balanced view of the German and Russian attitudes.  There was brutality on both sides.  Desperation, too.  I came away from the film with the gunfire still ringing in my ears and believing that I too had just been through the hell of Stalingrad.",9.0,Anonymous,History

This movie had me on the edge of my seat the whole time, wondering when the next shot would come and who would fire it.

The basic feeling is that no-one will get out of it alive, and if some of them do, it is not for cinematic but rather historical reasons.If I really force myself, I can probably come up with one or two criticisms of this film, but they would be minor in nature.

The horrors of war broken down to the lowest common denominator,"Nameless bodies floating face down in the Volga River or boats blown to pieces from bombs dropped by Stukka dive bombers is war as we have sort of known it in films, but when it gets down to the cross hairs in a high powered sniper gun being fixed on a enemy that you could recognize in a police line up for example, is another matter. ""Enemy at the Gates"" puts the cross hairs directly on the mark. I'm a big Ed Harris fan and he is wonderful again as Nazi super sniper Major Koenig, but Jude Law takes the day as Russian hero Vassily Zaitsev. This film is stark and real almost to a fault, but in the end it is a battle of wills of two men. One is described as a Bavarian aristocrat and the other a farm boy from the Urals. Throw in a grand performance by Bob Hoskins as Nikita Krushchev and a generally wonderful cast and you got an ""eight"" out of ten.

This is a story by it`s own which makes the movie much more interesting of course. The rest of the story is the battle between the russian sharpshooting hero and a german sharpshooter who has a reason of his own to fight the russian sharpshooting hero. The authentic battlefield, the actors (especially Jude Law, Joseph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz, Ed Harris and Bob Hoskins) are great and play their roles very well.

Suspenseful & Gritty,"Well. What can I say that has not already been said? I really enjoyed the film. I have to disagree with people that say the love story detracted from the overall quality of the film. Human life is not as simple as one emotion or action at a time. There is a constant barrage of things going on..much less in the minute to minute existence of the Russian soldiers. Ed Harris is quietly superb, as we expect, and Jude Law plays a range of emotions, from enthusiastic early on, to old beyond his years later in the film. The accents may not have been authentic, but this did not bother me either. It's much better than hearing BAD German and Russian spoken throughout.All in all, the cat and mouse game between Harris and Law WILL keep you on the edge of your seat. The audio in this film is simply amazing, and the cinematography puts you in the muddy, rubble strewn, bleak landscapes of 1942 vintage Stalingrad in ruins.

An  Amazing  Film  on  World  War  II,"""Enemy at the Gates"" is based on true facts that occurred during the siege of Stalingrad by the Germans during World War II. It shows the death duel between Russian top sniper Vassili Zaitsev and German top sniper Major Konig a most interesting confrontation indeed through the city in ruins.But what really amazed me in this picture is the incredible atmosphere obtained by the not so prolific director Jean-Jacques Annaud as he did before in ""the Name of the Rose"" with that unforgettable sordid and remote medieval monastery somewhere in the Italian mountains. I don't remember a film that shows so perfectly -if this could be possible- the horror, miseries, nonsense and heroism at war than ""Enemy at the Gates"" (perhaps ""Saving Private Ryan"" action sequences were close).If you like war films you can't miss it and if you don't its worth a watch too.Just for the record: in Argentina ""Enemy at the Gates"" was renamed as ""Enemigo al Acecho"" (something like ""The Stalking Enemy"").",8.0,Anonymous,History

An excellent World War II movie,"Enemy at the Gates is an excellent WW II movie in which I found few weaknesses. Jude Law really makes the movie great with his excellent portrayal (in tone, facial expressions, and other body languages) of the innocent shepherd boy thrust suddenly into manhood through brutal war, and later the uneasy hero of Russia's propaganda machine.We are told this is based on a true story. I am not a huge war buff so I don't know how accurate the events depicted are historically, but I was very impressed with the atmosphere created by director Annaud (Seven Years in Tibet) through the use of crumbled concrete landscapes, wonderful music, and earthy tone colors. This movie is full of stark and powerful images. Some of the highlights include the opening war sequence: Only one rifle per 2 men and the Russian commander yelling ""When the man with the rifle dies, pick up the rifle and shoot!"" Young wide-eyed youths getting herded like cattle to the front lines to die, the Russians turning their guns on the deserters...All very powerful and interesting images!Ed Harris does a nice job as the stoic and seemingly invincible antagonist. I was hoping we would get a more over-the-top performance from Ed (similar to other great performances ""The Abyss"" & ""The Rock"") but his quiet, silent, and deadly portrayal as the Nazi top sniper works just as well. I was happy to see Bob Hoskins and Ron Perlman give great supporting performances!Joesph Fiennes also put in another good performance as the political officer running the Russian political machine. Unfortunately, the love triangle felt a bit lackluster and tacked-on. Rachel Weisz's character felt like a silly cliche. The plot could have done without the love interest aspect. The main characters and action were interesting enough without it. The happy ""love"" ending really disappointed me as I felt it detracted from the strength of the film's otherwise strong messages/images about war and death.FINAL RATING: 8/10 Despite suffering from the Hollywood mainstream ""must have love subplot"" and ""must have happy-ending"" syndromes that ruin many good plot ideas, this movie still is excellent with its believable and interesting plot, excellent production values, stark and powerful visuals, and generally excellent cast that give excellent performances. It was also refreshing to see a WW II movie that tackled the great war from a new aspect (i.e. sniper view). Fans of all types of movies should enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,History

"Bad, boring, uninspired trash","1 of 10. Don't trust the positive reviews. From beginning to end, this movie is dull, boring, derivative and uninspired. The characters aren't introduced properly, their actions remain erratic, their motives unclear. Ed Harris' performance, though not excellent, is the only one standing out in a star-powered yet helpless cast. James Horner's music is a wrap-up of previous works of his, mostly Titanic, lacking almost every possible bit of originality.The movie lacks pace, most of all, and the entire situation seems rather unrealistic - where's the battle, where's the fight? The sets may seem impressive, the effects solid, yet not breathtaking, money surely went into this. But money isn't enough.It's not about just telling a story about aspects of the Stalingrad battle. It should be about doing it right, making a great film instead of just telling a story. This is nothing but a piece of uninspired Euro-Trash, unable to hold up to films like Saving Private Ryan and Braveheart. I won't say not to watch it, on the contrary: It can be extremely funny, unintentionally, for it is truly, sadly, really bad.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Very realistic from the human point of view,"I watched this movie on dvd a few days ago and, in spite of its many flaws, I am still wondering about it. The plot is very confusing and I agree with another reviewer that it might work better if it would be just another unnamed city rather than Stalingrad.I believe that the opening scene is almost irrelevant to the rest of the movie and, historically, is misleading (so to speak)  as well as the entire ``political'' foundation of the movie. Indeed, the opening scene makes an impression that all the Russian soldiers went to the war just because they were forced by komissars (or whoever), who shot them in the back forcing them to go forward. It is obviously not correct - most of them just protected their homes and families in this extermination war, where more then 20,000,000 (13, 600, 000 military) of the Russians fell (compared to more that 7,000, 000 of Germans (3,250,000 military), 295,000 of the US loss (including in the Pacific) and 388,000 of the UK death toll). This is actually confirmed by the main part of the movie where obviously nobody forces  Russians  to fight as they did during these very long months.Of course, I was not there, but I understand that if the company officers start shooting their soldiers in the back in the front lines, they will be shot by them ``incidentally'' very quickly too. So, this part of the movie is wrong to me. However, it is a historical fact that there were indeed security/interior troops staged relatively away in safety from the front lines, who did all the catching and shooting of those troops who were retreating to Stalingrad during the preceding months, following this stupid Stalin's directive forbidding it. I believe that this stupidity and incompetence  led to the loss of so many lives, when Stalin did not allow the troops and civilians to leave desperate and useless positions/cities or wanted to take a certain city on a certain holiday date, forcing his generals to comply with him.Another ``historical'' mistake was, I think, showing that political officers (like Hoskins) played the most essential role in  the defence of Stalingrad. It was done by regular militaries too, who eventually made  the komissars look as they were the redundant there. In the final victory the general Zhukov played the main role (as he did in all major victories in the WWII on the Eastern front: Moscow 1941, Stalingrad 1942, Kursk 1943, and took Berlin in 1945). I think the pivotal role of Stalingrad for the Russians was also exactly that Stalin and his likes finally understood (or more precisely were forced to undertand and back-off for a while} that the military professionals should be in charge if somebody wants to win.Having this in mind, and accordingly ignoring the opening scene I enjoyed the movie very much. I think it is one of the most realistic war movies I ever saw, where people are people and are not heroes (like Segal and his likes), and every one can die next in this terrible mess. So, I applaud the authors of the movie who show how normal people could find strength to remain be people in Stalingrad. As a suspense, the duel of snipers was very realistic and interesting to me, without this ``heroic'' cloud. The love triangle seems very proper to illustrate this ``antiheroic'' war reality, where people did not expect to survive but still wanted to have hope and remain to be human.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Great movie, Solid movie","The story of this movie is great. I love the suspense and anticipation. Enemy at the Gates is truly a work of art and a time capsuled masterpiece of a time in history read about and written about but never experienced with such vivid detail. Jude Law's portrayal of Zaitsev is very convincing. The direction of this movie is near flawlessness. The characters are well portrayed. You don't get a sense of emptiness like you do with a lot of poorly made films. You know where they throw in a couple of characters, don't explain anything about them and do a bad job of portraying the character's personalities.

War isn't really the Audie Murphy or John Wayne kind of brave charges into enemy lines, killing 50 enemy with one machine gun and a hand grenade. War is about surviving incredible situations, and 'Enemy' shows war at its most grueling.

A great war film that doesn't involve the US.,"I've scanned several comments placed on the imdb board about Enemy at the Gates, and felt a need to respond. I really enjoyed this film, with a few exceptions, and feel some of the posts are a bit over the top in negativity.My theory is that this film is so overlooked because it doesn't involve the US, rather two ""enemy"" nations - the USSR and Nazi Germany. If the US was involved, more things would have been forgiven in this film. Enemy at the Gates attempts to move the audience's attention away from the uniforms and towards the people involved in the battle. Yes, it is framed in a hero-versus-villain narrative, where we all cheer for the underdog, but it is done more intelligently than (for instance) Saving Private Ryan with its ""USA all the way"" sentimentality.The complaints about the use of accents are totally misplaced. Did anyone else notice that the Russians spoke with english accents while the Nazis spoke in american accents? Does anyone else think this is deliberate? I certainly do. Arguing that the accents takes the attention away from the film because they were different to what they should be (""Ze germans! Ze germans!"") are rather short-sighted. The accents were used to differentiate the conflicting sides to the audience, nothing more.I also found the romance a little tacked on to the movie, but it isn't that distracting. It does contain a realistic element or two, and serves to give the characters something to loose and / or fight over.The real thrill is the battle between the two snipers. Leaving behind huge explosions at the films climax, it all comes down to a battle of skill and patience. Good war films reduce the conflict of thousands into a conflict of just a few people (in this case two) that the movie follows. Enemy at the Gates does this successfully.Parts of this film are flawed. It does seem to follow the dramatic structure of Saving Private Ryan in dropping us straight into a horrific battle where one in every two Russian soldiers is given a rifle and the other is told to pick it up when the holder dies. Still, the technique works and does grab you. Parts of the film also feel a bit cliched (eg the love triangle) but a solid cast does manage to lift above this. Ed Harris is fantastic and Jude Law does a very solid job.Finally, for all those people who went ""there was no gate and no enemy standing at it"", well... sheesh. I'll explain it for you, since you obviously missed the film's explanation. Stalingrad was seen as a key city for the Nazis to overtake if they were to conquer the USSR. If Stalingrad fell, it was a) a slap in the face to Stalin who oh-so-modestly named it, and b) it was then a short trip to the capital (St Petersberg? Leningrad? I forget!) and victory. The Nazis were the enemies at the gate of the USSR's capital. Easy.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Law and Harris Shine in Annaud's Enemy at the Gates,"The Siege of Leningrad serves as the backdrop for Jean-Jacques Annaud's tenth film Enemy at the Gates (2001), starring Jude Law, Ed Harris, Joseph Fiennes, and Rachel Weisz. A more grim setting could hardly be imagined, but the movie will have you transfixed as Law and Harris face-off as crack snipers on opposites sides of the siege. The drama is intense and should have received more attention at its release in 2001.Jean-Jacques Annaud has brought such memorable and truly different films as Quest for Fire (1981) and The Name of the Rose (1986) to the screen. This film is also very different from the usual fare, and that is part of its appeal. Based on the book Notes of a Sniper (1956) by Vasili Zaitsev, in which he recounts his real-life experiences as a sniper during the Siege of Leningrad, Annaud takes us on tour inside that siege.We witness the Soviet troops thrown into battle with one rifle between each soldier. We see the civilian deprivation first hand and death lurks around every corner. We feel the futility and desperation of the siege that lasted 872 days and resulted in the deaths of nearly two million Russians.In the center of a spectacular set, ironically built in Germany, we see a recreation of the Barmaley Fountain as it was during the siege. A poignant and emotion-evoking setting to be sure. One wonders if the child-eating Barmaley, the fountain's namesake, has taken the form of the German Army. In true Russian fashion, would that make Jude Law, and his character Zaitsev, Doctor Aybolit (or maybe the Alligator)?As eluded to Enemy traces the story of Zaitsev, played by Jude Law, as he becomes a bastion of propaganda and hope for the Soviet forces and people. Thrust onto the battlefield without a rifle; he is lucky enough to escape the slaughter of his newly arrived comrades by hiding amongst the dead. It is while hiding that he meets a Soviet Party official, also hiding amongst the dead, played by Fiennes. Fiennes fire and fervor are unquelled by his surroundings. Using a dead man's rifle, he urges Zaitsev to kill some nearby Nazi officers. Zaitsev astounds him by killing five in less than a minute.Zaitsev quickly is promoted to the sniper corps, and as he racks up kills, the party machinery immediately pounces on the propaganda opportunity. He meets a younger Nikkita Kruschev, played memorably by Bob Hoskins, who congratulates him. Zaitsev becomes a hero to the nation, yet the siege drags on, and so does his grim task.The Nazi's are being embarrassed, and they bring in their crack sniper Major König, played by Ed Harris. Harris plays König very cooly and with the poise we've come to expect. On König's arrival, the film's actual story emerges as the true-life dual between these two harbingers of death commences.Rachel Weisz puts in a somewhat forgettable role as a woman soviet soldier, Tania Chernova. Tania's existence is true to history, but the love story is somewhat half-hearted. The film's real interests lie elsewhere. Indeed if you had seen this film in the spring of 2001, I would bet you have forgotten she was even in the movie.You will not forget Jude Law and Ed Harris' performances and the true-life story of Vasili Zaitsev, though.Monkeyfist.life",9.0,Anonymous,History
Forget the prefect perfectionists.,"When Hollywood or anybody else decide to make a movie, the intention is to get people to go and see it and make a profit, they can then make more movies and more profit, it's a business venture.Enemy at the Gates is a great story based loosely on fact filmed and performed to entertain the paying public, something it does in abundance, the scenes are stunning if you look closely, a building collapsing in the background, the feeling of desperation the people must have felt shows in the faces of the ACTORS, it is after all a film.The snipers were an elite band of killers, despised by both sides and never taken prisoner if caught, the young Russian boy & the more experienced German fight a duel for the right to be the best. Stalin and Hitler were doing something similar albeit at a safe distance, the feeling of the Russians fighting for their very existence and the Germans thinking what am I doing here in this God forsaken place can only be imagined, but again I think the film did a good job.I gave a score of 9, my only reasoning for not giving a 10 was that I found the accents a little bit hard to accept, but other than having Russian and German spoken with sub titles it was a small criticism.

Good war movie.,"""Enemy at the Gates"" is a good change of pace for war movies.  Instead of making a setting of Americans/British vs the Germans or Italians, this one takes a look at what was happening between the Soviet Union and the Germans. Stalingrad was also a good choice.  The writer could also have chosen Leningrad as well which was just a brutal.  This movie gave the audience different look as how the war was fought on the Soviet side.  How much of it is true and not completely sure.  However, the tactics that were used by the Soviets seemed accurate.The sniper warfare of Stalingrad was also accurate.  However, the duel did not occur the way it was depicted in the movie, it was a little more complicated than that.  I am also sure they were never close enough to see each others faces without looking through the gun sight as it was depicted in the end.  All in all, the movie was entertaining did not fail to keep my interest.  The love story could have been a little better or it could have been eliminated completely.  The film would not have suffered much if it had been eliminated.Overall, this one is worth seeing, (8 out of 10).",8.0,Anonymous,History
See war from a different perspective,"A darn good war movie, drawing heavily from the ""realism"" school of battle scene filming that has become the standard in the past several years. Very good performances by Jude Law and Ed Harris anchor the film, while the rest of the solid cast does everything expected of them.  I especially liked Bob Hoskins's performance as an overbearing, foul-mouthed, and fully believable Nikita Krushchev.Historically speaking, don't see this film as a replacement for your World War II textbooks.  As one historian once wrote: ""It is fiction, based on a grain of truth.""  However if you look hard enough, there are also accurate insights on the nature of the war.  The overwhelming manpower of the Red Army versus the mechanical superiority of the German Army is highlighted on several occasions.  Also nicely shown were the propaganda battles that were being waged simultaneously to the bloody fighting in the streets. Remember that Vassily Zaitsev was real, almost everything else is fiction or at best a guess.There is a romance in the movie, and it too is surprisingly well done. Normally I find attempts to weave a genuine love story into war movies a useless endeavor.  In this case, because the romantic story line remained understated in terms of total screen time, I thought it delivered nicely. It allows us the human side of war and gives us someone to root for.Finally, the problems with the movie.  First and foremost, there is a time to wax poetic about the nature of man's choices of governmental theory, and there are times to shut up and hope you don't get shot.  Most of the battle for Stalingrad I'd think would fall into the latter category.  In short, there are scenes that could have been cut.  With a running time of around 2 hours and 15 minutes, this film would have worked just fine at 2 hours. Secondly, I don't mind a disparity in accents, but please don't have the background extra characters singing in Russian or yelling in German when the main characters are speaking English.  It only serves to remind me that almost everyone is technically speaking the wrong language, English.All in all though, I recommend this movie.  Get inside the head of a sniper for a few hours, and see war from a different perspective.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"In the forest, the wolf lives for three years and the donkey for nine.","Your jaw drops as you see Russian recruits charging German lines in Stalingrad, and then being shot by their own when they try to retreat. You know this film is going to show a carnage of the greatest magnitude.Amidst the carnage, Commisar Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) meets Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law), a man with deadly aim. When Nikita Khrushchev (Bob Hoskins) visits, Danilov proposes that they use all means to promote Vassili's skill to increase the morale of the people. Soon, like Sergeant York, his legend grows throughout Stalingrad, and the people are temporarily happy. As Khrushchev says, ""Vodka is a luxury we have, caviar is a luxury we have, time we do not have.""The problem is that the German bring in Major König (Ed Harris) to find Vasilli. Konig is just as good as Vasilli, maybe better, and a cat and mouse game begins.The always lovely Rachel Weisz is there, and Danilov is pursuing her aggressively, while Vasilli looks on longingly. Another contest? Danilov and König prove they are above nothing in their quest for glory, even setting up one for a kill, or killing a child. One hopes for the end of both of them.A very satisfying story about a Hero of the Soviet Union.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Quite stupid,"What a horrible film.  The first five minutes made me feel like I was watching a sequel to Saving Private Ryan, and that's fine.  Though unoriginal, the gory realism of war is entertaining to watch for most violent mongering young men like me.But this movie quickly nosedives into several ludicrous sub-plots, and the battle for Stalingrad merely becomes the backdrop for two lame and hackneyed stories--a romance with two friends going after the girl, and a high-noon, Top Gun, who's the toughest guy on the block shoot-out.I came into the film expecting to be treated to lots of awesome, over-the-top battle scenes (eg Saving Private Ryan) and tense ""nazis aren't a faceless enemy"" (eg Thin Red Line w/Japanese soldiers) but instead get bored silly with annoying revenge cliches and cute kids.  And the irritating love story and preposterous and forced mano-to-mano scenes?  Don't get me started.This film hardly qualifies as a war movie.",2.0,Anonymous,History
A Long Days Journey Into Night,"I felt that with this motion picture a difficult ability was made more difficult. There is no time perhaps even unto mans history when such battles were fought as was the days that engulfed the world in World War II. The Battles at Stalingrad and then Kursk would for those interested mark drama so deadly,the cost in life so extreme that it is cause to look again at the passing of time with but a steadfast eye. It is a serious affront to our place in matters of the world and as compelling as any death the likes of which have no equal lest there be the tolling of the bells with the onset of the ""Black Death"". It is a very difficult position in its entirety to allow all the days to be as these days whereby millions of people were removed from the earth and time merely stood still as there was no day to be tomorrow for today was enough. The tragedy was not to be extended it was to be protracted in an end time concern. The Red Army was triumphant though such triumphs should be warned against when looked at more closely because there was nothing its equal in the record of mans place in this world and though it is an expense, the cost was a cost that turned the tide of events of World War II. When Germany's 6th Army was defeated it was representative of the rolling back of the tide with the battle of Kursk looking like a serious attempt to merely establish a holding position. It was not to be for the German 6th Army was not to stop back pedaling perhaps it can be suggested until the days of this war were to be done. Though it is suggested by these comments that the German 6th Army was retreating it is a note to be certain that the retreating Army did not always look like a retreating Army. Those whose interests have ever eclipsed the War between the States here in the America's will know that with Robert E. Lee at the helm. Confederate forces provided for General Grant more than a handful of engagements that were so deadly that they had eclipsed a much more deadly engagement merely days before. It was during the days that followed The Battle of Gettyburg a retreating Robert E. Lee exacted a cost that though dramatic and even victorious was to serve notice as to those who followed for this was war. Indeed it was something from Abraham Lincoln which though somewhat shocked at the toll of these engagements was to say,""Grant Fights"". The northern industrial might was a terribly important piece in determining the final outcome and indeed there was a real step up for the Russian Red Army that was supplied with so much that it just got bigger and bigger much like the Army of the Potomac under General Grant. Critical and dramatic were these events and one might suggest not unlike the other. This particular account in Enemy At The Gates is merely some Hollywood offerring which by no means allows us to know much of anything and as well everything sort of looks like everything else which is something that does not make anymore anything better. There is historical information that the account of the Russian defense at Stalingrad did benefit more than merely one expert sniper in Vasili Zaitsev, it benefited from an entire account as Russian sharpshooters were eating the Germans alive. Though Zeitsev is championed in this motion picture there were others whose accomplishments were even more so as their numbers were greater in confirmed enemy kills. There is mention of a film called ""War of the Rats"" whereby this very sewer to sewer, building to building, pipeline to pipeline served to undermine the German position and was instrumental in the German High Commands Decision to send for one of its very best Sharpshooters in a Major Konig. This particular film is useful at least for a time with this clever battle of wits that both sides waged with the arrival of Konig. If there was a moment whereby I judged this film it was in the moment of victory over a predator in this Major Konig as portrayed in the picture. I watched closely for an inability to know and was satisfied that indeed with a victory in hand, there was no doubt in its execution. There is a real disadvantage that the public in General are victims of and some of this victimization is as a result of not knowing the truth nor possessing the will to know better than merely this kind of offering. One of the areas not dealt with in much the same way however the Russians had an expert Spy ring called Lucy who was so well informed that long before something was to happen they,the Russians were to be ready. It was in an account of the Battle of Kursk that some of these hitherto unknown strengths possessed by the Russians became evident. This film is somewhat reticent to discuss these areas and indeed as suggested this may be merely an entertainment vehicle which I wish could find entertainment elsewhere. Hollywood belongs not on the field of the dead nor should such be made as to make money in performing as if to be something that this is not. This is not the real thing and it should not no not ever thought to be the real thing. It is thought that there was all this that occurred however there is in this film much exaggeration with storytelling more important than the story of The Russian Sniper Division so effective in disrupting German interests at Stalingrad that it may of altered history. If this film did anything it forced me to do some research and it is this research that made this, ""A Long Days Journey into Night"".",9.0,Anonymous,History
The greatest love scene I've seen so far...,"...Not the greatest movie, but... For the first time, I saw 'The Enemy...' at the cinema; it was dark (as cinemas used to be...), cosy, and quiet. I did not bite my nails all the time, yet there were some moments in which I was quite uneasy. Uneasy and uncertain of what will happen next, surprisingly finding myself entangled in the characters' lives. And there was that love scene...First things first, however, let's face the facts. The main reason for me seeing the movie was Jude Law. I may be mistaken, but he did not look better in any other movie I have seen. The scenes in which his eyes play the main part - makes me shiver. And I like the feeling.Apart from being a handsome man, Law is a suberb actor. He has the ability to take most of the character, however one-sided the role may be. Joseph Finnes boldly tries to keep his pace; Ed Harris does so with grace and Rachel Weisz accompanies the men as the leading lady with style. After seeing her in both Mumies, I had doubts... The Enemy made me go 'hmmmm... Good.'As far as the history is concerned... The American point of view of Russians is... Well... For many people out there, Poland equals Russia. It does not, these are two seperate worlds, but I guess we here, in cold climates, undrestand each other better. The primitive, drinking, bestial men shown in the movie... It was that way; it used to be like that. But throwing all Russians to one bag and all Germans to the other? I know it's easier this way. Yet 'easier' does not necessarly mean 'better'.And now for the previously mentioned love scene... Those of You who has seen it, know what I mean; those of You who still hestitate wheather to see the movie - do it, for the sake of this scene. Imagine a love scene among a crowd of sleeping, tired, dirty people, a love scene without a word spoken, without sweet music in the background, without tearing off the clothes and rolling on the floor... (Yes, yes, I know. I'm exaggerating now.)Or better don't imagine. Just go and see it.Really worth while.",9.0,Anonymous,History

They both decide to replenish the Russian newspapers telling of their various shooting missions for the good of the army. But when they both fall for Tania a soldier of the village it turns complicated. Erwin Konig is then called in as Germany's most expert marksman to take down Vassil being the hope of all Russia. All this sniper action is starting to weigh heavily on Vassil. Tania wants to be re-assigned from intercepting German radio transmissions and into the local militia. The movie right from the get-go captures the horrors and brutalities of war. Being dragged onto the battlefield, forced to stay together, and threatened to be shot if attempting to flee. How long can they continue the fight losing many of their fellow soldiers, knowing they'll die at any moment? Jude Law is excellent, Ed Harris is perfectly evil, Rachel Weisz is good even if the out-of-nowhere love story is sudden, and Joseph Fiennes shines as an officer choosing the responsible actions to win the war.

An exercise in extreme tension,"Jean Jacques Annaud's Enemy At The Gates makes a harrowing impact on the WWII genre, with a scope and vision that successfully transports us to the nightmarish battle of Stalingrad, near the tail end of an era of never ending bloodshed and terror. The large scale battle scenes which usually populate this type of film have been distilled into a much more intimate and exciting style of confrontation: elite sniper warfare. In the hollow, ash laden shell of a once great city, Russian patriot and expert sharpshooter Vassily (a barely acceptable, miscast Jude Law) tries to survive a nerve rattling battle of both the will and the gun against the German's answer to his legendary tactics, icy Major Koenig (a primal Ed Harris). Another man, Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) is a brainy scholar who spins tales of his friend Vassily's heroic exploits to stir Russia into a frenzy effort in the desperate final weeks of the war. The two are steadfast friends and vital assets to both each other and their country, until of course, a girl comes between them. Tania (Rachel Weisz) is a Jewish soldier who falls deeply in love with Vassily, boldly acted by her in a powerfully affecting sex scene that shows what passion Rachel is capable of in her work. She has the skill to turn a character that's purposefully written to fail the Bechtel test miserably into something more than the script ever envisioned, and is one of the best actresses working today. There's a grouchy supporting turn from Bob Hoskins as an infamous military higher up, and a brief but memorable appearance by Ron Perlman as a disillusioned Russian soldier who's taken enough crap and seen too much. What makes this film such a winner is the excruciatingly suspenseful sniper battle between Vassily and Koenig, each a coiled viper of awaiting violence, scanning the horizon along with the camera, breaths drawn alongside the audience, ready to spring into explosive action and knock our socks off in one of the most impressive wartime duels in cinema. It's been said that the purest form of war is one on one. This film takes that notion and runs laps with it, throwing unending tension at us that doesn't let us go from its vice grip till the blood flows in tandem with our ragged exhales, long pent up in clammy apprehension.",8.0,Anonymous,History
I almost cried...,"It's not often I cry when I am at the cinema, infact I don't think I ever have, but Enemy at the Gates brought me close in one instance. Just the frequency of bloodshed and loss of life so is imense it boggles the mind to think of it. I thought Enemy at the Gates gave a good even handed approach to that battle. While the love triangle is a bit intrusive to the one on one between Law and Harris, I do not think it spoils the film in any real way, like so many other reviews have said.When I saw that Ed Harris was going to be in it, I was a little apprehensive... but overall I think he was very well suited to the role.. he certainly looked German enough. Law was very good also, except that for some reason most of the main Russian actors (barring Hoskins) didn't attempt an accent... odd esspecially Sacha, I almost expected a ""SHINE YA SHOES GUVNA!"" from him while he was cleaning the boots of Koenig (Harris).Overall a fine movie, well put together and realistic (from what I have seen of the real battle). The movie does lay the line down, there are no good guys or bad guys... only individuals, something I thought Saving Private Ryan did much less.Oh yes and HORRAY for a war movie where America wasn't even mentioned if I recall correctly!",9.0,Anonymous,History
A Good War Story Without Revisionist History Lessons,"As a movie alone ""Enemy at the Gates"" is well worth seeing, as a ""war movie"" or as a piece of historical insight into a crucial part of World War II, seeing it is an absolute necessity.  More than that, it is worth seeing simply because it is a movie with a plot, characters and story to tell, unlike many of the big-budget, high-tech, special effects failures foisted upon on a weary movie-going public this summer.  Springing to mind is ""Pearl Harbor"", which by most accounts is a lame love story crudely and gratuitously cloned on to a pivitol part of American, and World history. (After I read that Disney Studios toned down that film in deference to the potential Japanese and Germans audiences, trading potential foreign sales dollars for veracity and integrity, I decided never to spend a penny on it myself).""Pearl Harbor"" is pertinent here because ""Enemy at the Gates"" also uses some very impressive special effects to depict realistic combat (which we all first saw in ""Saving Private Ryan"").  The horror of Stalingrad, the August '43- February '43 battle in which the story takes place, is remarkably brought to the screen, and the miserable conditions of both the Russian and German soldiers armies are shown, a detail worth noting: the Battle of Stalingrad represented the first loss by Hitler's Nazi forces, and the victory helped to inspire the Russians to begin their hard fought march to Berlin (culminating in April of 1945).  To put things in perspective, the Russians lost between 500,000 and one million killed in action during this fight, and the Germans about 150,000 dead; (of the 91,000 Germans who surrendered on January 31st, 1943, only 6,000 ever made it back to Germany after the war).  Compare these figures with the 300,000 total Americans killed in both Europe and the Pacific in World War II, or the 58,000 killed in Vietnam from 1963 to 1975.  Stalingrad has almost religious meaning for the Russians (and the opposite for the Germans, would would have conquered Russia if this fight had been won).The story of the movie is of a Russian farm boy thrust into a major propaganda role by a Communist operative looking out for his own advancement as much as that of the Glorious Red Army.  The operative had witnessed a sharpshooting display by this unassuming new recruit and realizes that tales of this simple shepherd fighting for the Fatherland would be a potent motivator for soldiers as well as the home front (the sharpshooter did, in fact exist).  As the exploits of the new Hero are reported by the Soviet propaganda machine, the Germans learn of him, and decide to send their own top sniper to crush this rekindling of Russian fighting spirit.  The second half of the movie follows their personal war, and its conclusion and although slow going at times, is still interesting.The actors all comport themselves well: the hero is Jude Law (the rich boy in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley""), the Communist Party operative who makes him a hero is the guy from ""Shakespeare in Love"", the pretty Russian Jewish girl who comes to play a big part in the relationship between the hero and his lobbyist is the female lead from the ""Mummy"" movies.  many other people have commented on the use of accents in the film.  The Russians speak with English accents, but I think this is just a device to show a) they are foreign and b) the class distinctions between them (the hero has a low class accent, the Jewish intellectual a high class accent).  To have had them speaking in corresponding American accents would have been distracting. Also distracting would have been fake sounding ""German"" and ""Russian"" accents if employed by the cast.Most viewers will be surprised by the brutality and cruelty shown by the Communists towards their own people.  This was very accurate.  The fact that the Germans (although certain atrocities are mentioned) are not shown as evil caricatures (like the British Commander in ""The Patriot"") is also positive for the overall story.  The heros nemesis, (played by Ed Harris), is shown as a high born and high ranking German thoughtful and cunning, as well as cruel, when necessary (he is, after all a sniper).  Heavy handed moralizing or messages do not get in the way of the character development or the story. (It is an interesting situation for an American to watch Germans and Russians fighting as a detached third party).In short, it's a good story, and an interesting look at an important piece of history without minimal Hollywood-style revisionism.

An opening to understanding,"Many movies in America about World War 2 focus on the American struggles and battles which includes heart-breaking, gut-wrenching films such as Pearl Harbor, Saving Private Ryan, and Flags of Our Fathers that all do a great job of showing parts of the war that the U.S. troops went through. These films cover history from the start of the war (Pearl Harbor), up to the turning points in Europe (Saving Private Ryan) and the Pacific (Flags of Our Fathers). Those who are old enough to see these movies also have been taught in school about the horrors and struggles that American soldiers went through in this time, but not many know what happened for the Russians. If you are curious to see what it was like for the Russians in WW2, or just simply enjoy war movies, then I strongly recommend that you see Enemy at the Gates.The film takes place at the Battle for Stalingrad where the German army is met by the citizens of Stahlingrad who mount a final resistance against the invaders. In the opening scenes, a political officer, Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), hides among the dead in a fountain at the square after scrambling for his life. To his surprise, he finds Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law) hiding amongst the bodies as well. Vassili quickly makes waste of several Germans as the two of them escape and become best friends. Danilov depicts Vassili to being a war hero through the newspaper as they print stories about Vassili's triumphs as a Russian sniper to inspire their comrades. In turn, the Germans send out their best sharpshooter, Major Konig (Ed Harris), to hunt down Vassili in order to crush the Russian hope. It turns into a showdown between the snipers throughout the movie as the two try to kill each other. Vassili and Danilov both fall in love with the beautiful soldier Tania (Rachel Weisz), but when Danilov becomes jealous of Vassili and Tania; he abandons Vassili in the struggle to defeat Major Konig. The film does a great job of showing how inhumane the Russians were at times along with how terrible the living conditions were for them. In the beginning of the movie, the Russian army launches an all-out attack on the awaiting Germans. It only turns into a massacre as Russian soldiers are shot by the Germans and by their own officers if they attempted to retreat. The special effects and gore in the scene do a great job of showing how awful it was for the soldiers as blood splattered from bullet holes and limbs flew through the air from bombs. Some Russian officers were forced to commit suicide after being out matched by the Germans. It's just so interesting to see what those men and women had to go through just within their own army, not to mention the fact that the Germans were trying to kill as well. In the movie, everyone speaks English in their normal voice and there are no Russian accents. At first people might say that it causes the movie to not be as effective because it's sort of far-fetched that everyone speaks English in Russia. This isn't the case. People don't feel alienated when they watch the movie because everyone in it speaks English and it makes the audience feel like they are a part of the movie which is what the point of the film is. This wouldn't be the same if all the characters had Russian accents.In the end, what you get is a high quality, heart-wrenching film that leaves the viewer feeling all sorts of emotions throughout the movie. It really makes you understand and feel for the sacrifice that those men and women made to counteract German tyranny and it's a good counterpart to the other World War 2 movies because it helps us understand our allies in the war. I believe this movie is comparable to Saving Private Ryan and I would definitely rank it in the Top 5 war movies of all time.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Not as good as it could have been,"Director Jean-Jacques Annaud and DP Robert Fraisse come up with a visual style I'm not sure I like, but know I haven't seen before. They've figured out a way to make big effects shots (Stalingrad being bombed by German planes) look cool without looking like they used a lot of CG. For all I know, they did use a lot. I'm just saying. They definitely succeed in giving `Enemy' a murky, dirty, even smelly look.It's a really good war film too. Not that it's the best one ever, but it has all the necessary elements of a great war film:  Intricate, well-staged battle scenes; human drama; showing mankind both at its lowest and at its most noble.  The war movie brings together the elements of many genres to create a genre of its own.Nikita Krushchev (Bob Hoskins) enforced Stalin's policy of killing on sight any soldier retreating out of fear. Annaud's telling of this tale creates a fascinating paradox. Where does the courage to resist the Germans come from if the alternative is going on living in Stalin's society? Talk about choosing the lesser of two evils.The backbone of the story is how Hope alone may have stopped the advance of Nazi forces in Stalingrad at the end of 1943. A political officer named Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) believes the city will fall unless its soldiers are given some sign of hope. He decides they need a hero and finds one in Vassili Zaitsev, a sharp-shooter who may be the finest in all of Russia. No German high-ranking officer is safe with Zaitsev within range of him. Within days, he's a national hero (a true story) and is Germany's number one enemy. They send (or does he come of his own accord?) Major Koenig (Ed Harris), their own champion sniper, to find Zaitsev and kill him.Each man is aware of the other and try and guess the others' next move. Each side uses its champion to inspire its soldiers. The news of either man's death, especially by the other's bullet, could turn the tide of the battle unlike any other event. What a great idea for a film--and executed to near perfection to boot. The love story and other subplots that accompany the two champions' struggle serve their purpose--they give the characters their souls.In a perfect world, this film would have been made with Russian and German-speaking actors with subtitles for the benefit of us Westerners. I know I would have enjoyed it more and taken it much, much more seriously if they'd gone the other way with it. Annaud wasn't of like thinking with Ang Lee, who could easily have made `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' in english.Then again why wasn't, say, `Schindler's List' told in its characters' native tongues? The reasons for both films being in english are identical and, valid. In a film in which many language are spoken, sometimes it helps to unify the communication by having everyone speak one language.  It's also a matter of knowing who your audience is going to be. Annaud knew he wanted this film to target a Western audience. As long as Russians aren't offended by it being in english, I have no problem with it. But like I said, I'd rather it were in Russian and German.`Enemy at the Gates' is a fascinating, exciting film. It's got everything you could want in a war film, but also goes a step beyond. The Battle of Stalingrad is a key moment not only in the history of Russia, but in the history of the world. Unfortunately, this may be the only education some people receive on the subject. So be it. It's certainly better than nothing.Grade: B",8.0,Anonymous,History

Pointless Drama,"Seeing that 'Enemy at the Gates' features the rarely shown WWII Red Army, I was hoping that it would take a really interesting and thought-provoking look on the war by overcoming the usual Soviet stereotypes and revealing Soviet soldiers and people's beliefs at the time. However, it failed to do any of those things and instead provided us with a cheesy and cliché portrait of war.Right from the beginning, despite the overwhelming battle scenes, you can already feel that there's something not right: the main characters played by Jude Law, Rachel Weisz, and Joseph Fiennes look too clean and too beautiful compared to their supporting cast and surroundings. Jude Law, in particular, with his perfectly gelled hair and his dreamy blue eyes, looks more like a boy-band member than a soldier. And this image indeed foretells the rest of the movie: it wastes too much time on the cheesy love triangle between the main characters and greatly ruins the tension of the movie. I really wish they could have spent all that time on actually exploring the war and the Red Army, which is instead portrayed in a very cliché and over-the-top way.Then there is the battle between Jude Law and Ed Harris' characters. Though it does seems gripping at times, mainly because there have not been a lot of movies focusing on snipers, it is ultimately damaged by bad editing and poor characterization. Sequences are usually cut short with details skipped over, making things seem much less dangerous and leaving characters' emotions not fully explored. And Ed Harris' character is just far too bland.Finally, the biggest problem in my opinion is that characters often seem ridiculously oblivious. For example, there's a scene where Rachel Weisz's character crawls through a vent and finds herself directly above the German base, but somehow, none of the Russians ever decide to use that to their advantages. Or like how the Russians have a spy that has direct contact with Ed Harris's character but only decide to use him after some of their important members have been killed.In conclusion, 'Enemy at the Gates' never feels like it's really going anywhere, and is a total waste of its interesting settings.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Solid War Movie,"What really ""made"" this movie was the authentic seeming atmosphere.  No one was elegantly groomed except for those in positions of power.  Dirt and blood and devastation abounded.  Jude Law does an excellent job of acting without speaking much.  Even he manages to look grubby most of the time -- and for someone who first saw him in 'Gattica' that seemed darn near impossible.  I'm not a big fan of love triangles, but they managed to not mess up the movie with this one.  Applause for all involved.

Great idea for a film poorly handled.,"I remember saying to my brother in 1994/95 that the story of the 2 snipers(or should I say 4) hunting each other down in wartorn Stalingrad would make an excellent film if it was done right, sadly this is not the film I had in my head. Give Wolfgang Petersen 20 actors, and permission to film in some godforsaken industrial wasteland in present day eastern Europe with a host of cheap extras and you would get the goods, i.e something intense, realistic and tightly edited. Instead we are treated to film by commity as boring, ineptly handled and inappropiate romance is injected into this film which drags the whole thing down, featuring the worst sex scene I have seen in a long time. What should have been a tight 80-90mins ends up over the 2 hour mark. As well as this the humour is dire, characters shallow and action scenes have no real tension.

Average at best,"We ran out of movies to watch that were available and thought we would take a punt on this film. However, we switched it off and watched some comedy instead after watching 1 hour into the film. Although the storyline was promising and the initial acting was OK, it was extremely off-putting to have British and American accents in a film that was based on a German army invading Russia...the authenticity in the acting is just not there (compared to Downfall for example, which is much better made and acted in the home language, German). It appears the Director was just relying on heavy hitting actors to pull the weight rather than thinking about the accents they actually had. For example, a Russian soldier ran into a building and then commented about how he had been shot through his ""pants"" referring to trousers (very American). Whilst most people wouldn't care about these things, I do pay great attention to detail and I would prefer a film that was as authentic as possible and the acting is a great part to how authentic a film is. I certainly won't be watching this again. If you want a bog standard American film to watch, then go ahead, but if you want a drama that was believable, avoid.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Fine production material but not much drama.,"Though I am very interested in the history of World War II and its biggest incidents and battles, sadly Enemy at the Gates did not live hot to my expectations of a noteworthy adaptation of the Battle of Stalingrad.Jude Law is a fine actor, as are notable additions: Joseph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz and Ed Harris. Though some top cast movies can fall flat and sadly I believe this is one of them.There is enough production material from the rubble of Stalingrad to make this movie watchable, as well as soldier customs and weapons for props, but there is not enough drama as the story flows, to make Enemy At the Gates a worthwhile WWII adaptation.Also, with the limited number of snipers featured in the movie, Enemy At the Gates comes across as disappointing as the actual history involved multiple sniper regiments and many high class snipers. So, it is unfortunate to say that Jude Law plays a an excellent sniper fighting a one-man war through the rubble of Stalingrad, with no sign of many other snipers.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Appalling,"This was a terrible movie. The russians had English accents, (the plump soldiers looked more like Dad's army than Stalingrad-skis). The acting and scripting were shocking. I walked out when they set up the love triangle between the apparatchik, protaginist and nurse. Truly dreadful.",1.0,Anonymous,History
