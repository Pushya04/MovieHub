Disney old magic,"Inspired by Frozen I started my search for new Disney movie which will offer me same ""Disney magic"" as i experienced in Lion King, Pocahontas, Bugs life, Frozen etc.So I found Big hero 6, and the magic started. This movie is made for all ages. What i find very interesting in this new Disney movie is that he is very educational, specially for children, but grown ups will enjoy ether. characterization is very deep , and you will feel as you are one of the characters in this beautiful story. Visual effects are stunning, so u will experience another Disney master piece.After seeing this movie , I would really recommend it to all movie lovers, especially fans of the Disney cartoon movies. If you are looking for an intelligent and inspiring cartoon movie for your youngest, you can stop looking because you just found it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney continues to impress with Big Hero 6,"Big Hero 6 is not among the best that Disney has ever done and it isn't flawless. But it is still very good and one of their best easily since the Renaissance. It did feel a little rushed at times and felt like it tried to do a little too much in the storytelling, as a result some ideas that were introduced like the science-is-good message gets lost. If it slowed down and explored a little less areas it would have improved things. The villain felt underdeveloped and his reveal came over as very obvious and forced as well.However, the animation is outstanding with lots of rich colours and textures, backgrounds that are incredibly detailed and sweet(but not in a cloying way) character designs. One of the best-looking recent Disney films definitely. The catchy and upbeat yet atmospheric and emotion-filled soundtrack and smart script are other things to like, as are the brisk(when not rushed) pacing and rousing if not exactly inventive action. While the story is not flawless, on the most part it's still a winner. Whatever originality it may lack, it more than compensates for that with fun and heart. There are plenty of funny moments(i.e. Stan Lee), and of the laugh-out-loud witty kind and even better is the emotional impact Big Hero 6 has. The brother-brother relationship is handled very affectingly, like between Anna and Elsa in Frozen it was Disney trying to explore a different kind of relationship than they did before and it succeeds in that respect.Sure Big Hero 6 sometimes takes a dark tone but not in a heavy or inappropriate way, there's no reason why anybody should be disturbed by that. The characters are not the most developed ones there ever were and as said more should have been done with the villain, but they're still engaging. Hiro is a very flawed but still likable main protagonist and his relationship between brother Tadashi is beautifully done. The most memorable character for me though was Baymax, he has to be one of Disney's most adorable characters, along with Maximus(Tangled) and Sven(Frozen) he has one of their cutest since the Renaissance. As well as being beautifully designed he displays a lot of laughs and a wide range of emotions, literally the film's heart and soul. The voice work from all(I just wish that James Cromwell had more to do) is very good, with particular mention going to Scott Adsit and his voice is a good match with Ryan Potter's deeply felt Hiro. All in all, not one of Disney's best but one of their better ones of the past 15 years. Haven't seen all the Best Animated Feature nominees but while this viewer did prefer How to Train Your Dragon 2 and the un-nominated Lego Movie they still felt that Big Hero 6 was still a good enough film to merit an Oscar nomination. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Lots of emotions and a good film for kids and adults,"I did read before I went to see this movie that Disney would be testing some adult subjects, like the loss of somebody. Without putting out some spoilers, I might say that the movie really touched my boys. I have two boys in the age 6-9, and both of them had both laughter and tears during the movie.It is a great action, comedy, drama package. Both my sons fell in love with Baymax, and if he where standing outside the cinema when we left he would have been given a big hug for sure.The storyline is good, and as a father I had quite a few laughs myself and managed to stay awake for the whole movie. Many times going to the movie with your kids can be a snooze-fest, but this one actually entertained me as well.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Disney Going Hero,"Big Hero 6 is another in a line of many successful Disney animated movies. And rightly so, might I add. The movie is about a boy, Hiro, his friends, Nerds and a health care prototype robot, Baymax. They live in a not so distant, technologically advanced future in a city called San Fransokyo. The story is action-packed comedy with dramatic elements to it and, as such, is appropriate for all ages. If you love Marvel movies, you will most definitely like this one as well. If you are more akin to beautiful landscapes and animated design, then by all means, this is the movie you will want to watch. If you are feeling down, the abundance of comedy, present in this movie is sure to make your day up. There is also a lot to learn from this movie, as some of the most important things (as well as most painful) in our lives, are depicted in this movie. Plus, the movie features one quite notorious figure (without too many spoilers). In short, the movie is a must see for children and for grown-ups as well, if they have a child lurking somewhere within them. Do not make a mistake and pass on a beauty of this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"a solid Disney-Marvel-Anime hybrid, if less than masterful","Big Hero 6 provides what you'd want in a movie as a kid, and maybe as an adult depending on how in touch you are with your inner-kid. Especially if you have a sibling (brother more specifically) the film's core relationship between Hiro and his older brother - it's not something that we see throughout, due to the first major turning point in the film, but the memory certainly remains strong - it will resonate. But the movie is only intermittently interested in pulling at your heartstrings; it's ultimately about suiting up, getting on the gadgets, and putting together a team. So the film is a lot of things in one - not to mention having an instantly adorable (i.e. lucrative) mascot at the center with Baymax.By saying that it has ""what you'd want"" in a movie, I don't just mean super-heroes in the Marvel tradition (though it doesn't have the Marvel banner, this is based on a Marvel title, albeit an obscure-ish one), but anime as well. Many of the story turns, including the ones that are rather startling and the tonal shifts from lightness to tragedy and then swiftly back to lightness and action and thrills, it's like what I might expect to see from Japan directly. Which, of course, is part of the source itself, and the fact that the city is called 'San-FrancTokyo' (ho-ho) and the film has primarily Asian characters - whether they're all played by Asians is another story, but I digress.I can't be too hard on a film that is just out to sheerlessly entertain the audience like this. It does have some points on the nature of grief and what happens when people are faced with losing someone who can't come back (... or can they?) I think it could've been even better, possibly great, if it had a bit of a better balance on the dark and the light sides of the film. Ultimately, I felt, the tragic parts came when they had to, and outside of that Big Hero 6 is essentially a Fun Ride Of A Movie (in caps), primarily led by a Doctor-cum-Fighting robot in Baymax, and some other supporting characters who are fine, no more no less. Just fine.But maybe Baymax is enough, and certainly, more often than not, this is a very funny movie. He has the entertainment value of the Genie in Aladdin - like in that film, he's the friendly BIG companion who can help save the day for the protagonist - except instead of the thousands of impressions of Williams, it's the exact opposite that makes him appealing: one personality, pretty straightforward, and the dead-pan nature is closer to, oh I don't know, Jeff Bridges in Starman. He's the perfect innocuous character, but is hilarious for the reasons of reaction and straight silliness.It should also be noted the last act, the climax, has its predictable points - like most (or almost all) superhero movies, i.e. from Marvel, it has to all build up to a gigantic Must-Save-the-City from impending gargantuan destruction, involving space as well. And a turn from a character kind of comes out of nowhere, which is fine except that the development is kind of off to suddenly be the ""villain"". However, again, akin to anime, so I can let it slide and still be sucked into the peril of the thing (I mean, hey, they can't all be The Incredibles).For what it's worth though, there's so much to enjoy with this film that I'm sure if I was younger I'd eat it up with a spoon and want seconds-thirds-fourths-etc. It's an insatiably pleasant film to experience, faults and all. 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Awesome,"My family got tickets to an early showing. The movie was excellent. The atmosphere was refreshingly different, the characters fleshed out, the plot touching, and the humor was rich and consistent . I would recommend this one to anyone, and especially to couples and families with children.Big Hero 6 really blew me away, I expected it to be good since Disney is having another animation renaissance but once the credits began to roll all I could do was wish it was longer. This movie has something for everyone, comedy, action, some despair. In fact, surprisingly the only thing missing was romance, which is fine with me. If you love superheroes, robots, and animated films, I think you've found your holy grail.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
How to develop a lifelong love of the movies,"A little over a year after I took my granddaughter Catrin (then almost three) to her first ever movie ""Frozen"" (which she utterly adored), I took her (now just four) to see this very different film from the same stable (Walt Disney Animation Studios) and I'm delighted to record that she loved it. We saw it in IMAX in 3D and we were both blown away.Although this time the central character is a young boy - Hiro Hamada of the city of San Fransokyo - rather than two princesses, my granddaughter had no trouble relating to it because Hiro is so cute, his inflatable robot Baymax is androgynous, and two of his four friends - making up the six heroes - are very capable girls.I reckon that ""Frozen"" plus ""Big Hero 6"" - with a few films in between - will give her a lifelong love of the movies.",,Anonymous,Animation
"5-word review: Dazzling, witty, emotional, enjoyably action-packed,","Thankfully not the sixth film in a sextuplet, Big Hero 6 is the latest visually dazzling Disney film since the studio's resurgence. I was not a fan of Frozen, deeming it inferior to Pixar's elite animation masterpieces, and the feature- length music video to 'Let it Go' was mildly enjoyable at best. However, Big Hero 6 is much more fun, with science prodigy Hiro Hamada (voiced by Ryan Potter) forming a bond with his brother's home-made ""huggable"" robot invention Baymax (voiced by Scott Adsit) and subsequently creating a team of superheroes to combat a masked villain with a nefarious motive (it's way better than I just made it sound.)The best part about Big Hero 6 is undoubtedly one of 2014's cutest characters. An ever so slightly more health conscious Groot, Baymax, your personal health care companion, is the film's highlight. He and Hiro provide both a surprising amount of emotional depth and superb action sequences which most definitely reflect the story's connection with Marvel. The supreme quality of the animation makes the action and flying scenes through the excellently-designed 'San Fransokyo' city skyline visibly awesome, cueing an unfortunately audible Neo-worthy ""Woah"" from me several times. The soundtrack is also highly recommended.Big Hero 6 isn't without its faults though. By all means don't lose faith if you need to see it with an offspring or younger sibling; it's certainly an enjoyable time. But it is not as re-watchable or fantastic as a Pixar offering or Disney Renaissance film. This is mainly due to the poorly fleshed out characters, with the exception of the two leads - the supporting characters who form the superhero team are decently done but disappear for a while before being re-introduced. Maybe I've become spoiled by Pixar over the last few years and am expecting too much from a kid's film. Probably. But make sure to see it anyway, and treat it like a Marvel film (which really it is) by watching out for the Stan Lee cameo and staying for the post-credits scene.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Everyone needs a little Baymax in their lives,"Big Hero 6 [2014] is the Disney 3-D animated comedy action film that centers on Hiro Hamada, a 14-year old robotics prodigy, Baymax (an inflatable health companion robot) and an unlikely team of superheros.5/5 graphics. Big Hero 6 transports viewers into a new visual realm and relatively individual style (besides its anime resemblance). The story is set in the futuristic city of 'San Fransokyo'. A little of Tokyo and San Francisco in one place. This explains the amalgamation of both Japanese and American components within the story and setting. It should be noted that Big Hero 6 is not a wholly original idea, and the animation is inspired by the Marvel comic by the very same name.Baymax. Voiced by Scott Adsit, this lovable robot is animated to appear soft, cuddly and adorable, credit goes to the graphics and writing team on this one. Hiro's close friendship with Baymax is a highlight. Baymax can hold his own on the screen alone too, just strolling through the city streets, caring for others health and well-being. So yeah, he's cute and he knows it.Expect to have a couple of teary moments. I won't describe or skim through details, out of utmost respect for those who haven't had a chance to see it yet. Since more serious topics aren't the usual in children targeted animation films, it's a nice change of pace.Fantastic message for the young'uns. The main character Hiro (voiced by Ryan Potter) and the rest of the superheros team study robotics at the local university (including T.J. Miller from Silicon Valley and Damon Wayans Jr from New Girl). Reach your potential, practice non-violence and exercise sacrifice. That's just the tip of the iceberg. There are more spoiler-worthy ones that will be omitted from this review entirely. By the way, it's not 'preachy' in the slightest.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Delightful superhero movie targeting a young audience,"What I appreciated most about this movie was the setting, having neither been to San Fransisco nor Tokyo I cannot comment on if it is true to either of them - but I really liked the city and the culture that resulted from it.You can hardly see the effect of the technological advances that has happened in this world, and because of this it feels like it's in the near future. As it is a movie for younger audiences, it is understandable that they want it to be easily relatable.The parts of this movie that I did not like are probably some of the parts that the younger audiences will like the best. The Fred-character was partly delightful, but also ""too much"". The same with some of the moments in the film (like the suggestion given by one of the heroes in the last fight). Some of the motivations of the characters are also simplified so much that they are hard to understand.If you are a comics geek, I recommend staying till after the credits!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"If you love Disney and Marvel movies, Big Hero 6 is definitely for you!","I went to watch this movie with my son aged 10 and daughter aged 7 - it was my son who was especially keen to see this, and to be honest, I wasn't really expecting much, as I hadn't watched any trailers about it, or heard much about it, & I thought it maybe more a boys' movie and my son would enjoy it more than my daughter or myself...However... For the entire movie, myself and both of my children were completely immersed in it, and it evoked a range of thoughts, feelings and emotions in all of us, which included laughter and reducing us to tears (and I don't usually cry easily!). We all came out from the cinema each wanting our very own Baymax, and we were talking about and reliving moments from the movie for weeks after!

A must watch for Marvel fans,"So basically, it's a movie which is inspired from the Marvel's comic book with the same title. Removing the serious parts from the comic book, Big Hero 6 by Walt Disney is a bliss for those who ended up loving similar movies, for example, Kung Fu Panda, The Incredibles etc. They have changed the story a lot which makes it way too different than the comic.Other than that, what I loved about the movie is how, throughout the movie, Hiro, the protagonist learns of responsibilities and to come over his pain.They have done a great job on Baymax, who, in the comic was a ""monster"" (seriously)? At some point, the movie seems like it is lacking the fun but that's just for 10-20 minutes and I am very sure of the fact that most of the viewers will end up loving Baymax for his behavior and way of speaking.This is not some another movie like Planes but a whole new experience from Disney which blends comedy and action nicely along with a sense of responsibility.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A cool story with great animation and voice acting.,"Honestly, I put off watching this because I didn't feel like I would enjoy it so much. I was proved wrong. Right from the start, the fresh animation of this film along with the brilliant editing and voice acting had me engaged. Though the plot is pretty flat and for kids, the concept is pretty new (in that it hasn't been totally overdone), dealing in robotics which allowed them to show some cool stuff. But the story being from Disney, did have moments of it being 'too easy' as well as a few stock characters but it wasn't such a big deal. The story was told well, and wasn't cheesy or boring at all. The freshness of the voices and the animation really put this film together.The connection between the voices and animation really showed on screen the chemistry between the characters, and this worked to gain the sympathy of the viewer's at certain scenes. I thought that was well done, the characters were developed well in relation to each other. And I know I keep saying this, but I just really like the animation, and the effects. Baymax is so cute, and the other character's have a kind of Asian feel to them. It's also quite cool how the animated characters almost always resemble the actors voicing them (I guess this is intentional).However, watching the trailer again, I notice that they miss some of the scenes out. I mean if you put it in the trailer, you've got to put it in the film! I would've liked to have seen the scene with Baymax and the soccer ball.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Terrific.,"I am not a huge fan of CGI films. Now I am not saying I dislike them, but I do feel that sometimes there are too many and too many mediocre computer generated cartoons. However, I think that ""Big Hero 6"" is definitely a welcome film to the genre. Why? Because the film is absolutely beautiful, as the graphics are just amazing. Additionally, while I also think there have been way too many superhero movies, this one is different enough to make it worth seeing.The film is about a brilliant young man named Hiro. Hiro, though incredibly bright when it comes to robotics, is directionless until his older brother introduces him to his research facility at the local university. To win a scholarship to the place, Hiro creates an amazing robotic system--one so amazing that someone is willing to kill to get it. And, once they've stolen it, Hiro uses his brother's medical robot, Baymax, to help punish the baddie and restore justice and niceness to the world.While the film DOES feature the usual sort of finale (the weakest part of the film--though I do understand why it's there), so much of what leads up to it is nice. I liked the characters, the back story and the writing. It's really very clever in places--such as their wonderful use of Stan Lee in his cameos since this one is so unusual AND he appears twice in the film (so stay and watch ALL the film or you'll miss it). Well worth seeing.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney's Latest is possibly its Greatest,"It has been a good year for animated flicks. Lego had a crack at it, a dragon breathed fire once more and now Disney is back to put the competition to shame. There was once a time when PIXAR overshadowed Disney, now that process has been reversed with the likes of quality films from 'Tangled' to 'Frozen' and now 'Big Hero 6'.In a world where superhero films have become its own genre, the market recently has been flooded – with well too much of everything. Have these marketing executives over at Marvel ever heard that less is more? I doubt it. Although 'Big Hero 6' is a Disney film, it was actually adapted from a Marvel comic. The real question is that do these two existing franchises work well together? You can bet everything that you own they do! All the key hallmarks of Disney are there – minus the music numbers, with added wise cracks and wit surely helped by being brothers with Marvel.Our hero is a 14 year old boy called Hiro Hamada resident of fictional city San Fransokyo who teams up with his friends and lovable, caring and unintentionally funny robot Baymax. Their bond is one of loyalty, friendship and full of heart. No bond has been stronger since that of Andy and Woody in 'Toy Story'. The six heroes – hence the title – realise their city is in danger and must become their own brand of funky superheroes in order to fight this mysterious new force.'Big Hero 6', like most Disney films is daring, be prepared to be put through the emotions frequently. This film will undoubtedly draw comparisons to other superhero ensembles that we have been treated to like –'The Incredibles', 'The Avengers' and 'X-Men: Days of Future Past'. Consider this the icing on the cake.Of course the film has visual flair, so much so that I initially thought PIXAR were the ones responsible. The voice acting without question is stellar and the characters therefore feel fully formed, had I not known it was animated I would have sworn that the characters and their relationships with others are real.'Big Hero 6', really hit hard for me how animation is rivalling that of live-action. Many superhero films were released this year, four, yes four others! But this one stood out and had me crying like a little baby. Consider that a compliment, I don't think that live-action films even had half as much feeling as this film – ironic considering that the characters are computer animated! Many of the sceptical among us will shout and cry no musical numbers from the rooftops! Does this mean that the score from Henry Jackman is worthless? No! It is energetic and vibrant providing some of the best superhero themes ever produced! Just wait until you hear the new Fallout Boy song; 'Immortals', it works seamlessly into the film. If this is what it cost to not have musical numbers them I'm all the more happy for it.How could I call this anything less than spectacular? I can't! Anyone in need of a great animated film step right up! It never panders to the kids, always thrills and most importantly understands key human emotion, particularly loss and how to deal with it. I've honestly never felt so happy that animation exists within cinema since 'Beauty and the Beast'! Anyone in question of my belief should see it for themselves; this is truly an opportunity you cannot afford to miss!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"With the Action of Marvel, Emotions of Disney, and Comedy of Both, Big Hero 6 is a fantastic film for anyone.","Back in 2009, Disney purchased Marvel Comics for four billion dollars. Shocking and surprising the world, many fans of both sides were curious whether Disney would make an animation film based on a group of characters from the comics. Three years later, Director Don Hall approached John Lasseter on making a film with Marvel Characters and found the Big Hero 6, a comic book series that even the most well known of comics didn't know who they were. In fact they were so obscure that Marvel themselves even forgot that they had the characters.Marvel gave Disney the liberty to change the characters so that they could be seen as a Disney Animation Film. And the result is simply refreshing.Big Hero 6 is a beautiful film, showcasing how much animation has become. The east and west coast mash up of San Fransokyo combines to make such a spectacular scenery, that the city may as well be a character to the film.The cast is also fun to watch. One annoyance films try to do is by shoving the diversity of characters in your face. Big Hero 6 doesn't do that, instead the focus is on the characters themselves and not the diversity, making it enjoyable to watch. One of the biggest highlights is the girls of the cast. I took my 3 nieces with my friends and I, and they loved how they were smart, enjoyable and didn't need to fall for a man. The cast is truly relatable, whether you are precise like Wasabi, positive like Honey Lemon or just a guy who loves media like Fred.Of course the star of the film is the robot of Baymax. Any scene that he is in steals the show, whether it is his introduction or his care for Hiro and Company.The Villain by far is one of the best villains in recent Disney history, he doesn't sing, dance or monologue, he simply gets the job done.The film showcases the action greatly by giving large scopes and music that fits exceptionally well. Emotionally, the film captures the audience by showcasing the bond of brotherhood between Hiro and his older brother Tadashi, as well as his friend Baymax who is like a Surrogate brother to our main hero.A strong lesson in this film, is that family can be more than blood related, you have friends, who become part of that. That really showed how much I cared for the loved ones around me, especially my older brother who is in the military, creating robots and fixing medical equipment.If there was one complaint I would give, I would've like to see a little bit more about the rest of the team. Other than that, Big Hero 6 is a heartwarming tale that captures something for the entire family.Big Hero 6 is another showing that Disney can continue to make great films after the juggernaut that was Frozen. This film showcases that the Disney Revival (Films such as The Princess and the Frog, Tangled, Wreck-it-Ralph and Frozen) is not over yet, and I cannot wait to see what the next film has to offer.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A pretty fun Disney film,"'Big Hero 6' isn't my favourite animated film of 2014 (that distinction belongs to 'The Lego Movie'). However, it is enjoyable and entertaining.What makes this films work is its characters and their interactions with one another. Hiro, the main character, isn't wholly original. He's your typical genius kid protagonist that you see in a good amount of family films. However, he is fairly well rounded enough to root for and be an enjoyable presence. I particularly liked a brief moment in the film in which his character took a slightly dark turn, which something that I don't normally expect from a hero (or should I say Hiro lol) in a Disney film. Baymax is also a fun character. His voice actor, Scott Adsit, does a great job of bringing him to life and giving him the right balance of robotic monotone and human personality. The relationship between the pair, which acts as the film's emotional centre, is definitely one of the film's strongest elements.The other members of the ""Big Hero 6"" are also enjoyable characters. They never overshadow the two main characters and don't really go beyond the stereotypes of their characterisations but they serve their purpose. The highlight of this group is Fred, a superhero and giant monster enthusiast who is probably the film's best source of humour.The film is also very pleasing to look at. Like any film from Disney's main animation studio, the animation is top notch. The film takes place in San Fransokyo, a wonderful amalgamation of Japanese and American culture.However, this film is not without flaws most of which come from the script. It has a very clichéd and predictable story. The reveal of the villain's identity isn't surprising at all. Even when the villain has been revealed, he isn't really interesting or well written. For the most part, the dialogue is pretty good. However, there are a handful of lines that aren't. In particular, one line of exposition feels very forced and unnatural. There was also a plot hole that momentarily took me out of the film (which I won't reveal in case you want to figure it out for yourself).The film contains two scenes in where our main characters construct their inventions over a period of time. The first one was told through time lapse, a decision that I quite liked. The second one, however, was your standard montage. The montage isn't bad but the use of 'Immortals' by Fall Out Boy in it felt out of the place and didn't really convey the emotion of the scene.'Big Hero 6' is not the best animation has to offer but it is still a light-hearted and enjoyable film with some well-executed emotional scenes.

Very entertaining and overall well-made,"Honestly, I didn't have very high expectations for 'Big Hero 6', considering that I'm usually not a fan of Marvel's works, but I was gladly proved wrong.Story wise, 'Big Hero 6' is rather formulaic and not too outstanding, but it's still very entertaining due to the way it balances all aspects. You have everything: drama that's not over the top but still touching, thrilling action, great comedy, and some okay twists. And more importantly, they all mix together perfectly, so you'll never get bored or frustrated, and at the same time, you will feel connected with the characters as they deal with some mature conflicts rarely seen in recent Disney products. A huge part of this accomplishment is thanks to the character Baymax. The guy is amazingly likable, steals every scene he's in, and has great contributions to every part of the movie. When the movie needs drama, he provides the sensitivity and cuteness, when it needs action, he's the coolest, and when it needs comedy, he's the funniest. His voice acting by Scott Adsit is also great as he sounds both emotional and cute, despite the robotic voice effects.The rest of the characters, however, are hit and miss. Hiro is cool, and I like the way he deals with grief: quite mature and not excessive, though his voice doesn't sound like a 14-year-old. The other two boys in the group are okay because they tend to break away from stereotypes. But the others, including the main villains, are just cliché and forgettable.Visually, 'Big Hero 6' is very stunning, mainly due to the lively San Fransokyo and the impressive effects. Personally, I find some of the action scenes in this to be the most cinematic and thrilling I've ever seen in animation. All of the camera movements, slow-motions, and lighting and explosion effects easily rival the best live-action blockbusters out there. Moreover, the characters' visual designs are also more imaginative than other recent Disney products'. This is especially true for Baymax, who is surprisingly expressive despite the minimalistic looks.'Big Hero 6' is no masterpiece, and it may not be up to the standards of Pixar's classics or Dreamworks' 'How to Train Your Dragon', but nonetheless, it's still a greatly entertaining and well-made movie. I also love that it still leaves a lot open for the sequels as I now really look forward to them.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"""Big Hero 6"" is a bigger deal than you might think.","What IS ""Big Hero 6"" anyway? Yeah, I know that it's an animated film from Disney and it was the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' choice for Best Animated Feature of 2014, but what does ""Big Hero 6"" MEAN?

But there's more at stake here for the movie than whether its title confused a formerly ignorant movie fan or two. This film has to live up to its Oscar win! Does the movie deserve the award? Does the basis for the title become clear during the film? Does this reviewer ever tell the readers about the movie? Read on and find out! Does ""Big Hero 6"" refer to the giant marshmallow-looking robot that is featured on the movie poster and in its theatrical trailers? No, it doesn't.That robot is called Baymax (voiced by Scott Adsit) and is the creation of a very talented college student inventor named Tadashi (Daniel Henney). Tadashi created Baymax as a health care provider. Baymax can assess your physical and emotional health in an instant with a pain-free body scan and give you the help you need. And Tadashi designed Baymax's look to make him more effective, or, as Tadashi puts it, ""non-threatening and huggable"".So is ""Big Hero 6"" a reference to the President's Affordable Care Act?? No.Baymax is completely apolitical – and he actually works. Besides, he doesn't go away until he hears you say, ""I am satisfied with my care."" How many people have said that about Obamacare? But that's how 14-year-old Hiro (Ryan Potter) meets Baymax. Tadashi takes his brother Hiro to his college's inventors' lab in hopes of inspiring the brilliant and precocious (very) early high school graduate to actually do something with that big brain of his. It works. Hiro is impressed enough with what he sees at San Fransokyo Tech Institute that he decides he has to become a student there. (San Fransokyo is the futuristic mash-up of San Francisco and Tokyo that serves as the fictional setting for the story.) So, Hiro sets out to invent something in order to impress Tadashi's professor, Robert Callaghan (James Cromwell), enough to gain Hiro admittance to the program. That works too.Is ""Big Hero 6"" somehow a reference to Hiro??? Nobut you're getting warmer.Hiro's invention is a revolutionary new tiny robot, or microbot. It's smaller than some computer thumb drives, but when it gets together with a bunch (a BIG bunch) of others like it, and their efforts are directed by the thoughts of a human wearing a neurotransmitter headband, their potential is practically limitless. As an interconnected group, they can form shapes, lift and move heavy objects and even transport people across the room or across town. A fire at the lab later that night consumes more than just the lab, and Hiro's dreams and motivation seem destroyed too. Eventually he learns that there was more to that fire than he realized and he builds some carbon fiber armor for Baymax in the hopes that the two of them can get to the bottom of what happened and try to put things right. But it's too big a job for just the two of them. Hiro and Baymax end up getting help from Tadashi's (and, now, Hiro's) college friends, Go Go (Jamie Chung), Wasabi (Damon Wayans, Jr.), Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez) and Fred (T.J. Miller). They adapt their inventions to make themselves more formidable than they would be as mere college students, fashion superhero costumes and identities for themselves, and away they go – as a team.Does ""Big Hero 6"" refer to the six newly-minted superheroes???? Yes! This film is actually an origin story for a group of superheroes in the Marvel Comics universe. Making this film as an animated feature rather than a live-action movie allows the creators a lot more freedom to create the spectacle that is this film. The animation is amazing. It is not detailed in an HD way, but is impressive in its smoothness. And the colors are as varied and vivid as I have ever seen in an animated movie. The story is great too. As a relatively obscure group of comic book superheroes, the Big Hero 6 can become whoever the creative minds behind the movie want them to become. The script contains elements of danger which give the film a little more depth than in your average animated feature, but keeps it kid-friendly by making Baymax into a physically reassuring presence. The movie is also family-friendly as it clearly endorses respect for elders, healthy ways of dealing with emotions and the selflessness that is required to truly be part of a family (or group of close friends) and make a difference with your life. As an origin story, an Oscar winner and a very profitable film, you can expect a sequel. But what will they call it since the original already ends in a number? Well, I guess that doesn't matter as much as the sequel living up to the quality of the original – especially since most people seem to agree that ""Big Hero 6"" deserves all the profits and accolades that it has received. I think so too, and give this film an ""A-"".",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Classic Disney,"Okay I had some expectations on Big Hero Six going into this. I was aware that Hero Six was already a Marvel property that Disney was relaunching as their own separate movie away from the Marvel cinematic Universe. Well to be honest I don't see these guys throwing down with Iron Man you know because they are animated. But one thing I will say I had a lot of fun with this movie, kinda reminded me of my own child hood as well.Right from the get go we are introduced to our Hero in this movie, ironically called Hiro. Automatically I loved this little guy and I was already on board with his adventure. He was funny a lil cocky and kinda had a Luke Skywalker sort of Vibe to him, with a spice of Marty Mcfly (Star Wars and Back to the Future similarities stopping now) But then the movie takes a dark turn (no Spoils so relax) and it reminded me of old Disney movies such as Lion King and Bambi. I always thought that lately Disney movies have been dulled down, and instead of teaching kids life lessons through cinema they are more focused now on just preserving their innocence. But not in Big Hero Six's case these guys hit us numerously with heart tugging emotions that really make me think back to classic Disney. For the record its not like they are shoe horned in these events, they have key elements to the characters development and the stories development as well.On the lighter side the movie was funny it had a great story line, kids mums and dads will love this movie, hell I'm 18 years old and I'm buying this when it comes out. we are introduced to characters like Baymax who I can so easily see being this years hottest toy weather it be on plushy's or any other gizmo toy industries can concoct.Go see this movie if you love Disney a good laugh and just in general fun. One of Disney's jewels Cheers",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Why is this getting so much hate?,"To be honest, when I saw the preview I thought it was going to be another Disney movie gone bad. So when the movies came around, I had really low expectations for it. But holy crap nothing has made me laugh this hard at a movie since maybe Amelie or Up! Baymax is a non-threatening huggable robot who's only purpose is to nurse those who are in need of medical attention. The only way to wake him up is to scream out ""OW"" and he is alive and will help you until you are better. The only way to put him back to sleep is to say ""I'm satisfied with your work"" (Or something like that I'm only paraphrasing) and he has gone back to sleep. But this movie isn't all comedy: it does have a bit of an emotional side to it which I won't go into too much detail about. However I do know that the movie isn't really like the comic books: the back stories of the characters aren't how they are in the movie and even the plot itself isn't like how the movie is, so for the devoted comic book fans, I understand if you hate this movie. However the people who didn't read the comics confuse me when they say it's ""Cliche"" ""awful"" ""boring"". I found none of these things in the movie at all. I was smiling right from the beginning and found myself a little teary-eyed towards the end.So I do recommend this movie if you're up for a nice light movie with a lot of laughs: it might be better than you think.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney meets Marvel,"Quickie Review:Hiro is a science prodigy inspired by his brother Tadashi to build and contribute great new technologies to society. After a tragic incident involving Tadashi, his creation Baymax, an inflatable robot does all it can to help Hiro during this difficult time. Soon a new threat linked to the accident arrives in the city of San Fransokyo, forcing Hiro and his friends to create their own superhero team. With Tangled, Wreck- It Ralph, and Frozen, Disney is going through a renaissance in their animation department. Big Hero 6 is yet another solid addition to their roster. Although the premise is not original in its simplest form, the characters and the adorable Baymax make this adventure worth experiencing.Full Review:With such an impressive streak I expected Disney to deliver at the very least a good film. In terms of the story it was very predictable. However, the colorful characters and their personalities is what saved this movie. Most of all Baymax was awesome!Baymax may be the cutest robot in animation since Wall-E. He experiences the world and the people in it with a childlike innocence. He steals each and every scene he is in. He may be huggable but when he needs to throw down he is a formidable opponent to go up against. Though he might not necessarily realize his fighting potential. The 3D animation is gorgeous, blending western and eastern cultures to create the beautiful San Fransokyo. The action in the movie could be on par with the current generation of superhero movies. Big Hero 6 is like a mini animated Avengers, but each of them is a nerd using their scientific expertise to become heroes. The movie is not just an action thrill ride but an emotional one as well. You would think majority of the movie would be filled with light-hearted humor, and it is. Still there is a moment where the movie goes much darker than I had anticipated. I liked that the filmmakers didn't hold back on the dark tone because it made the following emotional scenes much more effective.Although I had fun with the film, there are few things that I wish was done a little better. The masked villain is completely obvious. I knew who it was the instant he showed up on screen. Even Scooby Doo and the gang would request investigating the identity to be a little more challenging. So the intrigue and motive behind the mask is not as impactive as it could have been. The rest of the supporting cast and team members are fun but they aren't given much screen time with Hiro. It would have been nice if we had seen more of their relationship together rather than it being sum up in a 3 min montage.In the end Big Hero 6 is a heart-warming tale about how far we are willing to go for our family whether it be by blood, friendship, or in this case even electric circuitry in a giant balloon. This movie is a clear indication that Disney has not lost its momentum and I cannot wait to see what else they have in store for us.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Predictably strong animation; unpredictably stronger themes,"It didn't really hit me why I eagerly anticipate animated films each and every year, whether they be from high stakes studios like Pixar and Disney or low-key efforts from Blue Sky Animation or Rainmaker Entertainment. To me, every animated film is an opportunity to showcase different writing and directing talents, as animated studios rarely keep the same director for every single project. Sure you have directors like John Lasseter or Pete Docter that frequently direct films for certain studios, but often, you get a solid variety of films made by people you've never heard of and that provides for a film experience akin to watching a filmmaker's directorial debut.I only noticed this when I reflected on the bulk of Disney's films at the turn of the decade, from the enjoyable ""Tangled,"" to the joyous ""Winnie the Pooh,"" the incredibly fun and, my personal favorite in years, ""Wreck-It Ralph,"" and the beloved and cherished ""Frozen,"" the studio has consistently churned out a wide variety of films from a barrage of talented people. Disney's latest, ""Big Hero 6,"" as expected, is no exception; this is a briskly-paced and different film for the animation studio, as it adopts a structure more akin to the one we've seen Marvel take on in recent years, and creates a film from the ground up that keeps its morals in check and its checklist of adventures in mind every step of the way.The film follows Hiro Hamada (voiced by Ryan Potter), a fourteen-year-old technology prodigy from San Fransokyo, a city built and thriving on technological innovation. Hiro, despite having the intelligence and time to spend on debatably more significant projects, enjoys the concept and strategy of ""bot fighting,"" or the act of two small robots dueling until ones destruction. Hiro is kept in line and motivated by the work of his older brother Tadashi Hamada (Daniel Henney), a skilled engineer, who has created a tubby white robot named ""Baymax"" (Scott Adsit), who is designed to monetize the healthcare system in America by providing non-threatening and responsive care upon hearing the expression ""ow"" from a person.In the midst of all this, Hiro gets in contact with Professor Robert Callaghan (James Cromwell), a renowned technology guru who becomes attracted to the fourteen-year-old upon viewing a tutorial of his invention of ""mircobots."" Microbots"" are tiny, metallic links that swarm and fit together to create whatever the human mind can imagine, proposing immense innovations and efficiency in architecture and transportation. However, after tragedy strikes, Hiro's motivation flatlines, and it's only him, Baymax, and a group of Tadashi's loyal workers that can stop a potential threat to technological and scientific evil.When Hiro and his band of inventors band together to form a group of superheroes, ""Big Hero 6″ easily could've opted for a sound and lights show, disregarding all the potential morals and ideas it laid so neatly on the table. However, despite a narrative structure that reminds us of the many Marvel superhero films we've seen this year, ""Big Hero 6″ keeps key morals in place, some of which are understanding the differences between external and internal pain, as brought on by the presence of Baymax and how unprecedented scientific innovations can be used simultaneously for good and bad. We see all of these ideas pan out and develop over the course of the film's runtime and never does the film become too rushed or too simplified to the point where lofty morals are sacrificed for rock-em sock-em action; the balance is delicate and well worth commending.On top of great, sound morals, ""Big Hero 6″ instantly wins thanks to a cuddly and lovable hero, Baymax, who finds ways to charm with his straight-forward nature and his strive to make everyone around him comfortable. Baymax steals almost every scene he is in, and meshes quite well with the other characters, working germane to their characteristics and never undermining the true force of Hiro as a character. The film, in addition, is predictably gorgeous, with eye-popping colors and wonderfully animated surroundings, effectively delivering the aesthetics as well as the morals in a neatly-wrapped package. ""Big Hero 6″ may not rank as highly as ""Wreck-It Ralph,"" but seeing as it operates on a minefield of pitfalls and destructive forces, the fact it succeeds this well is a small miracle in itself.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very fun and enjoyable,"This animated film tells the story of a technology geek who lost his brother in a fire in a technological convention. He finds out that his invention called microbots got stolen by a masked man, and he sets out to save the world with his friends.""Big Hero 6"" has fun and really cute characters. Everyone is very adorable, especially the marshmallow robot who has unconventional superpowers. The best thing about this film is that the superpowers are technologically relatively sound, at least in the not too distant future, making the heroes and the plot look a little more realistic within the fantastical dream. I also like the mash up between San Francisco and Tokyo, making the city look like San Francisco with a Japanese twist. I enjoyed the film throughout, and there is not a moment of boredom.",,Anonymous,Animation
Such a great movie.,"This movie is absolutely wonderful. It really reminds me of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" which is probably the best movie of 2014. I just love how it so effortlessly mixed heartwarming emotion, with thrilling action, and laugh-out-loud comedy.For a quick synopsis, the movie is about a young boy named Hiro who is gifted in robotics and has an older brother named Hadashi who he looks up to very much and for good reason. Hadashi is also a brilliant scientist who has built a remarkable robot named Baymax who has the ability to scan people and give them medical treatment and advice. There is also a group of Hadashi's friends, the funniest being Fred, and there's also a villain whose motives and identity are not revealed until the climax of the film. After a tragic accident occurs and after learning that it was a planned attack, Hiro, Baymax, and their new group of friends end up creating a rag-tag group of superheroes which they name ""Big Hero 6"". The only reason why I gave the movie an 8 instead of a 10 is because of the villain. I just feel like some of his actions and his overall attitude are a bit over-the-top evil and his motivations aren't successfully explained. With that said, this movie is truly for everyone and it has something that I think many animated movies have been missing lately which is a very good plot, and endearing characters that you learn to care about deeply. I also love how they didn't make Baymax too human-like. I really hate when movies do that with AI characters, I think it's a cop-out because the audience will obviously care for a machine if it acts and looks exactly like a human. I also hate how they overuse the whole ""questioning of love"" cliché with those characters. In this film, Baymax understands that love and friendship are important to people because those things are important to a ""patient's"" emotional well-being. Although he is a believable robot, you can still get attached to him just like Hiro does because he is such an adorable, lovable, sweet-matured character and it doesn't hurt that he looks like a big marshmallow.Although the film introduces awesome new superhero characters and has some amazing action/battle scenes, what it truly succeeds in doing is being a thoroughly entertaining movie that tugs at the heartstrings, and makes you root for these great characters. I left the movie in awe of how it so effortlessly entranced me and brought me into it's unique world. I can't imagine anyone watching this movie and not loving it so, if you're reading this review to see whether you should watch it or not, definitely do, you won't regret it.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beautifully animated and fun filled family adventure,"Disney has brought many gifts and rarely disappoints me. Big Hero 6 is one of the best Disney films I have seen since last year's Frozen. This film is fun, clever, imaginative, and filled with spectacle. While the film is somewhat similar to Pixar's The Incredibules due the film's plot dealing with robots and and children with superpowers, it is very enjoyable and would easy please children as well as parents.Big Hero 6 is not only brings out the charm with heart-filling characters and comic relief but has some of the most dazzling CGI I have seen in a Disney movie. The animators did a fantastic job on the character models and the environment was nice looking. My favorite character would probably be Baymax. What's not to like about a funny, inflatable robot who cracks funny one-liners,has the power to heal, and assists Hiro (main character) on his quest to defeat an evil scientist?I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this movie. I recommend this movie to all parents and children. Big Hero is a family thrill ride!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Almost perfect....,"Hiro is a teen genius who seems to waste his time until his brother sets him on a right track. Tragedy strikes, and Hiro teams up with new friends to find the truth...eventually saving the day.Baymax is a robotic healthcare assistant that could have been developed as the usual annoying sidekick that has the heart of gold, but he just has a heart of gold here--as in doing research, his only intention is to help whomever he can.On a scale from 1 to 10, I rate this movie a 9 because its heart and soul outweigh the problems I have with it. Some scenes might be upsetting to younger viewers, but it is perfect for all ages.My issues:1. One of the characters sounds stereotypical. 2. The villain's identity and motive feel tacked on.I know the primary audience is not going to notice things like this, but I do...and I this happens to be one of those times that I cannot let it go.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Big Hero 6 Continues Disney's Resurgence Towards Its Lost Glory.,"From the creators of Wreck-It Ralph & Frozen comes another impressive outing that's as fresh, smart & intuitive as the above mentioned films and, apart from continuing the recent success streak for the studio, also marks their first foray into the genre of superhero filmmaking as the premise is based on Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name.The story of Big Hero 6 concerns a young prodigy who develops a special bond with his older brother's creation called Baymax; an inflatable robot designed to serve as a personal health companion. But when Hiro discovers his own creation being used for evil purposes, he transforms Baymax & his friends into a band of high-tech heroes to take on the person responsible.Directed by Don Hall & Chris Williams, the first half is filled with lots of creativity, passion & ideas that are seamlessly blended with elements of humour which is then presented in a very polished manner while the other half takes a more generic route but nevertheless succeeds in maintaining a fine balance between its emotional & humorous aspects to wrap itself up as one of the most polished films of the year.Coming to technical aspects, the 3D animation is absolutely gorgeous for each frame is rendered in meticulous detail with expert use of colour contrast, saturation & sharpness to provide an intensely vibrant look to the whole picture. Camera-work is brilliantly carried out for it's pretty dynamic in the action sequences while more relaxed during dramatic moments. Editing briskly paces the whole story while Henry Jackman's score further enhances the experience.Yet the best thing about Big Hero 6 remains its interesting set of perfectly voiced & finely written characters with the constantly developing bond between Hiro & Baymax serving as the core ingredient that makes this film work on so many levels. Baymax is the standout character here for he's simply impossible to not love and his cuddly, cushy & innocent appearance blended with soothing voice brings a charm of its own to make him an instantly huggable character.On an overall scale, Big Hero 6 is a sweet, funny, touching & colourful tale of companionship that's richly animated, skilfully narrated & emotionally satisfying and has something in store for viewers of all ages. Sophisticated in all departments, filled with heart & compassion, and exquisitely demonstrating the best of both Disney & Marvel in one action-packed feature that's full of awe & admiration, Big Hero 6 continues Disney's resurgence towards its lost glory & is one of this year's finest animated flicks.P.S. Make sure you don't miss out the accompanying short film, Feast, which would put you in just the right mood for the main feature presentation.",,Anonymous,Animation
An emotional ride that strikes all the right cords at all the right moments.,"Big Hero 6 is the kind of film I enjoy watching for entertainment – yes, a bit of a redundant statement. You walk in expecting a fun animated film with wholesome family values and you walk out feeling like you got so much more. The narrative is easy to pull apart. It's a simple story told in a simple way; effective but shallow. Usually this will be a sore point as the narrative is the most important element in my opinion. Considering the genre and form of the film – 'fun animation' remember - I won't hammer on that. The narrative is rich with moments that are emotionally enthralling. The exciting moments are somehow extra exciting and the sad moments extra sad. The characters start off looking rich and promising but soon turn flat. The lead character is great, I enjoyed the development there and most of the other characters go through a small but significant development as well; right at the 'save the day' moment which is predictable but nicely done. The character of the villain however is disappointing. The change in the character is such a huge stretch and a lot of the setup for the villain is just nonsensical. The ending is cute but a team of tech savvy crime fighters made me sigh, why is returning to a life of science not enough? As a bit of an aside, the resolution for the villain is surprisingly bleak and effects more people than just the villain; none of them in a positive way. With the values the film present and the family friendly attitude of the story, I found that character resolution a shock. Not necessarily a bad thing, the complexities of responsibility is also a valuable lesson even though you wouldn't expect to find it in a friendly animation film. The style of the film is beautiful. The animation and the sound is immersive and the moments get their intent spot on; funny is really funny, sad is really sad, disappointing is uncomfortably disappointing, and that makes this an entertaining film in the moment. I found it didn't leave me with any afterthought (perfectly acceptable) but it did leave me with a smile on my face and thoughts of when I was younger.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Good, but would've been better if they dropped the superhero angle","Overall, this was a cute, likable and fun movie. The aesthetics were really great. The superheroes had pretty fun aesthetics, powers and general appeal, and the action and adventure was pretty enjoyable. Definitely the best part of all was Baymax and his relationship with Hiro.However, while this movie was good, I wouldn't say it's exceptional or anything. It probably would've been much better if they hadn't tried to make it a movie about a superhero team and instead had a story more focused on just Baymax, Hiro and their relationship. I know this seems contradictory, since I just said I found the superhero part fun...but I still feel like the movie would've been stronger if they had been replaced by more focus on the stronger part of the movie.While there were good parts about the superhero aspects, there were also some definite flaws as well. Most of the team is really underdeveloped. I definitely want to like them, and to an extent I do, but they just didn't have time to give all the characters the delineation and development they needed.In addition, making this a superhero movie allows them to rely more on clichés, making the movie fundamentally less interesting. If they had made a movie more focused on just Baymax and Hiro and not requiring as much superhero action, they would've ended up with something much more ""all its own"". It wouldn't just be another superhero movie, except animated. It would be no longer be something so defined by its genre.I just want to emphasize that the Baymax-Hiro aspect of this movie was really strong in so many ways. Baymax is different from other robots you've seen in many ways, from his design to his personality. He's not another robot who wants to become a human or be accepted as a human or anything, his goal is to perform what he's programmed to do, and to do it in the most endearing way possible. He's just anthropomorphic enough, but they don't overdo it or focus primarily on that aspect of him. A really interesting dynamic is also created by Hiro trying to reprogram and redesign Baymax and get him to do things he was never intended to do. It would've been so much stronger if they had focused more completely on this aspect of the movie, instead of forcing the superhero team angle which I feel was ultimately detrimental. You can still incorporate some of the same themes of revenge and whatnot. You can still include a villain. You don't need all the clichéd superhero aspects or all the extra spectacle.Again, I actually LIKED the other characters on the superhero team. But ultimately, I would gladly sacrifice them for a much stronger movie overall. And that's what would've happened if they had focused on this movie's true strong point. This movie was certainly decent, but if they hadn't insisted on it being a superhero movie, it could've been truly GREAT.Oh, and I would just like to mention that I guessed the villain's secret identity IMMEDIATELY. And by that I mean, even before they showed the supervillain, when they showed the person who is his secret identity for the first time, I knew he would turn evil. There were also a few suspension-of-disbelief testers, like how Baymax was able to detect anyone in the city, the fact that a certain character managed to stay alive when (s)he really shouldn't have been able to, etc.Overall, this movie was fine. But if they had dropped the superhero aspect and focused more wholly on Hiro and Baymax instead, it could've been much, MUCH better.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Too similar to other movies,"This movie has glowing reviews but I just found it to be... obvious. The story (or the characters) is an obvious ripoff of How to Train Your Dragon, and there's even one scene where it's extremely obviously ripped off. The characters are pretty cliche as well. Everything they tried to do and all the emotional scenes just felt like a product to me. It felt soulless, forced. The animation and background is good. I liked the very final scene. But all in all, it seemed wrong. The creators just copied too many things from other previous films.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

So balanced and enjoyable,"This was one of the most enjoyable films I have watched in quite some time, and is one that I believe I'll continue to enjoy even years down the road after viewing it multiple times.It offers great balance to the story and is pleasing to a wide range of audiences. The session I went to watch in the cinemas had people old enough to be my father and kids young enough o be my own all getting heavily engaged and enjoying the film.If I were to be completely objective, I should in fact be giving this film a score of about 8.5. It has a good story, good actions scenes with good animation, and a very healthy serving of humour, making it an exceptional movie. Unsurprisingly there are elements that are quite predictable, which would prevent it from being a flawless film, but given the emotional response it can evoke, and just the sheer enjoyment it gave me watching it, I was quite happy to give it a perfect 10.This movie, despite being targeted primarily at a much younger audience than me, really captivated me. I was always engaged, and never left wanting, which combined with the fact that it struck a few personal notes with me too, meant that it was by far the most enjoyable film I've watched in recent years.Very impressed with it, and highly recommend it to anyone, of any age.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
a GREAT film. one of the best,"so i originally didn't care for this film. a waster of time, irrelevant to both Disney and marvels big plans. i assumed it would end up like daredevil or black cauldron, best forgotten, bow was i wrong. this film combines the amazing animation, writing and greatness of recent Disney like frozen and tangled, with the great plots of marvel. it nearly had me in tears at times, because there is so much emotion in this film, and had me laughing uncontrollably at others. the group is full of personalities that are lovable and great. baymax is the true highlight of the film, but hiro and tadashi are incredibly stong and great characters. wasabi is always there for the comic relief and gogo is bad-ass. but they all become great as serious characters. and you have to love how honey lemon says ""hiro"" obviously, there are some issues. no film is without sin. it is predictable, cliché and some of fred's lies are just too stupid for words. but they aren't the points that you will remember. this film is definitely worth a watch and i suggest to to EVERYONE",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
On to a Winner,"Big Hero 6 can be considered as Disney's first outright animated superhero film and its surprising that it took so long given the genres immense popularity. There have been times when the area has been touched on before and Pixar have delved into it with The Incredibles, but this is the first time we get to see Disney adapt an actual comic to the big screen. Loosely based on the Marvel comic strip, the film takes advantage of being animated and allows itself to be as creative as possible. It follows Hiro as he, his robot Baymax and four of his friends form a superhero team following an accident involving his brother.The story flows very well, providing plenty of excitement and adventure, whilst getting surprisingly emotional on a number of occasions. Our protagonist Hiro does grow throughout the film and it is very effective. We see him struggle to decide his future, then his world comes crashing down and it's not until Baymax starts to help him that he realises he can depend on on his friends. There is certainly a depth to this story that goes beyond many Disney films, with many parts touching on issues such as depression and the how important friendship can be to an adolescent. It is done very subtly and never tries to push any of these ideas down the audience's throat, which was a welcomed thing. Though I would have enjoyed more superhero material I can't fault the film for dealing with such complex themes.The characters are both entertaining and relatable. Hiro can be a little flippant but he has all the traits of someone struggling with themselves. He can be self-assured, humorous and brash yet he is also sensitive and despondent at times. He is a well-rounded character and he develops as the film goes on. Baymax is by far the funniest thing here. He gets plenty of amusing lines and offers some great physical comedy, but it's his warm temperament and genuine innocent that are always charming. Hiro's brother Tadashi is also very likable and the bond between the two is strong from the outset. I do think the side characters lack depth, especially compared to Hiro and Baymax, but they all have clear personalities and do offer plenty of laughs throughout. The main villain is something of a bore given his lack of personality, but his motivations are well thought-out.Disney delivers the goods once again from an animation stance. The animation is very slick and detailed, giving just the right balance of colour and refinement to proceedings which match both the superhero style and the more subdued tone. The idea to combine San Francisco and Tokyo into the same city was genius and it looks spectacular here, the amount of detail in meshing the two cities together is clear and it provides a very unique setting. The action sequences were also very impressive. The fight scenes were graceful and smooth allowing for a lot of cool techniques, whilst still retaining a weight that made it look forceful. I also enjoyed the way in which the heroes' powers were shown and they were inventive with what they created.The dramatic writing was certainly a standout feature. There were even a few tear inducing moments, most of them thanks to Hiro and his relationship to his brother. It felt like there was a real connection between these characters, even with a robot like Baymax, which is where a lot of the films strength comes from. There is a real maturity to this writing and an understanding, the writers really captured what it feels like to be going through these emotions. Even the villains motivation, which can suffer from feeling forced, felt totally justifiable here. The comedy worked well for the most part too. Though I would have liked little more, there was plenty of versatility in the jokes and the slapstick was fantastic when it popped up.For me Big Hero 6 continued Disney's run of excellent CG animation. This is certainly an example of a film that has more to it than expected. What appears to be a fun superhero adventure frequently delves into some pretty mature themes and the characters have motivations that are deeper than they first appear. I enjoyed these characters, wanting to spend time with them and see them develop. From a technical aspect the film is tough to fault, the animation looks beautiful, the action is excellent and there is a lot of creativity to the world that it has crafted. A little more superhero and comedic pieces wouldn't have been out of place, but the film deserves credit for the challenging angle it takes. It's a film that balances itself perfectly and rewards you with its level of maturity.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
this is just fantastic <3,"I just LOVE this movie!! How awesome was mixing San Francisco with Tokyo and the plot was lovely, I am in fascinated with the brother's love and friendship. I can't understand why people hate this much, this is a movie for kids!!! I am tired of all this comments ""was cliché, was predictable, was stupid.."" It is made for all ages, God. Is it too hard to understand? And please, stop comparing movies, for lord Jesus. Baymax is one of those characters who can basically do no wrong. Every sequence he's part of is automatically funnier just because he's on screen. A big, gorgeous, consistently funny and touching animated adventure. And what i love the most about it was that it celebrates nerd culture. And not merely the pop-culture- obsessed version (comic books) but the let's-invent- something-cool kind. To me, this kind of films makes me want to work in this business of creation and entertaining, highlighting universal values and dreams. Personally I have to say that this is very inspiring and motivating, it reminds me a lot of my little brother who is a genius tech lover I am separated from him but watching this, kind of make me feel him closer. Now I am feeling better after watching this movie. It just worth it, and I give a 10 to 10, it is going straight forward to my top 10 of my Disney favorites movies of all the time. Thanks again Disney, you made it again! <3",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Amusing, often quaint, animation pitched at youngsters & superhero fans.","""Big Hero 6"" is somewhat of a departure from form for Disney - the crisp animation; amusing characters and rapid-fire narrative are all there, but it just doesn't 'feel' like the usual fare from the famous animation studio who are perhaps more synonymous with magical lands; ugly, ruthless villains; muscular heroes; beautiful princesses and mythical adventure stories. This is Disney attempting to branch off into superhero territory - an attempt at placing each of their eggs into a basket which is squared solely at the adolescent demographic rather than the family unit of mum and dad, brother and sister.It's difficult to put here that the film is a failure - I liked its twists and turns where, villain and would-be villain are cleverly transposed; I thought it executed its tonal shifts between action-driven fun; horror and depicting the grieving process really well, but there was something missing from it to have me think it was better than pretty good.Principally, the film's actually rather cryptic title (don't worry, it isn't a sequel - there aren't 5 other entries to see before this one!) alludes to its protagonist, who is named Hiro. Hiro is a boy-genius on the mathematical/engineering level who lives with his brother and aunt above her donut shop in a future-set city which is a (reasonably) clever amalgamation of San Francisco and Tokyo. At least, it has something resembling a Chinatown district and that huge red bridge we'd all recognise in a flash if it was shown to us.A master builder and inventor, Hiro is squandering his talents in constructing inconspicuous-looking robots for a kind of miniature robot themed 'fight-club' among the grimy backstreets of his post-modern home city. Said practice is illegal, yet he persists - a kind of automatronic Eddie Felson amongst a sea of other lowlifes and gamblers who keeps winning big off the back of a boyish grin; innocent voice and some po-faced enthusiasm which has his opponents think they can win easily.One night, he and everyone else are busted after a raid - his brother Tadashi, another scientist and inventor, reiterates that he is on thin ice. Hiro, despite possessing an obvious talent, is sniffy about it - indifferent as to following in his brother's footsteps in studying at the local university. The film provides him with one other defining characteristic: that his parents died in an off-screen accident - usually a sign that an adolescent in a film needs only one more push to completely topple over the edge.Disaster strikes when, at an open evening at said university, a fire engulfs all within its vicinity and claims the life of Hiro's brother - just as Hiro was beginning to realise what a fantastic thing it might be to study there. In order to infer just how much of an impact Hiro might have, the film has him provide a Steve Jobs-like presentation on a recent invention he concocted: millions of tiny building blocks which will forge themselves to whatever neuro-command you provide them with - something resembling what Carrie White might have been able to do with Lego. All might not be as it seems, though, when the one remaining robotic block Hiro possesses seems to want to join its brothers, despite the rest of them apparently having gone up in flames. This pushes Hiro out of his depression and onto his quest to find out if all is as it seems...Hiro is chiefly helped in his quest to discover the truth behind the fire; his brother's death and where his place is in life by a large white robot named Baymax, which was his brother's invention designed as a first aid response to medical emergencies when cries of pain are detected. In spite of being made for this purpose, the robot is somewhat cumbersome - moving slowly to shift a chair out of the way when we first see him activated, despite under the impression somebody is in need of urgent help. As a supporting character, his monosyllabic putdowns and statements at the most heightened of times are genuinely amusing; meanwhile off screen, he is no doubt shipping tens of thousands of action figures and plush toys.Where B-Max is responsible for the most important line of dialogue in the film, that of when he asks Hiro if ""...eliminating {the villain} will improve your well-being"", Hiro's other supporting acts in the form of a motley crew of young students from the university exist for less substantial reasons - forming a superhero troupe off the back of learning of Hiro's discoveries and leaping into action in a manner that seems to want to be subversive of the genre, but actually ends up being a little tacked-on.The film seems desperate to tuck into the substance behind the approaching fourth industrial revolution, dealing in the process with the co-existence of man and machine and what this signifies for the next generation as one potentially replaces the other. We witness Baymax, an otherwise passive entity enslaved to whatever programming he possesses, used to both help and harm, but nothing especially leaps out at you on the issue. I like how the film seems to encourage aspiration - going to university is construed as a good thing, not to mention the film seems to promote creative thought and imparts a number of positive messages along these lines to youngsters. The film is, however, largely a chaotic blur of colour; quips and spectacle - one that few will find particularly amusing.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Outstanding movie with a balanced cast,"When I first heard Disney was doing a movie about giant robots, I was skeptical. I thought it would be just like Transformers or all the other giant robot movies.Boy, was I mistaken.It's not traditional Disney--there's no romance, princesses, or blockbuster songs--but it's actually better without those things.Baymax has to be one of the best Disney characters I've seen. For a robot, he's quite the personality, rivaling even WALL-E in that regard. Unlike Olaf from Frozen, Baymax doesn't exist solely for comic relief--he plays a major dramatic role in the movie as well.The rest of the cast shines and each member is given memorable lines.If I had a drawback, I would say it's the soundtrack. However, Frozen's was a tough act to follow.But Big Hero 6 has it where it matters most--heart. I guarantee that you will want your own Baymax by the end of this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Nothing Big,"I will preface this review with acknowledging a bone I have to pick with this movie. This movie won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, and it won it the same year films like ""Song of the Sea"", ""Tale of Princess Kaguya"", ""Box Trolls"", ""How to Train your Dragon 2"" and ""The Lego Movie"". The film is not better than any of those films. I will try my best not to hold the decision against the movie but recognize that I might be more critical on it than other films.I will start with the positives. I like how this film demonstrates how cool science can be. The heroes of this film spend a lot of time in the lab, but none of them are portrayed as dorks or nerds, they are cool, confident and popular people. I think that can be a positive influence on children watching the film. The music, particularly with the training montage, is really good. Likewise, the animation is impressive. The setting of San Fransokyo is very visually interesting. The characters and location set up in this film do have potential. The potential is capitalized more in the follow up animated TV series.On the negative side, this movie follows all the usual beats you'd expect from a movie like this. It does the usual kids' movie stuff and the usual superhero movie stuff. One thing that they do, our main character, Hiro, keeps his robot, Baymax, a secret from his mom. Why? The mom knows that Hiro and his brother make robots, why does the robot need to be a secret? The reveal of the villain, which they build up as if it's a big surprise, it so obvious, even the 4-year old who watched it with me knew who it was going to be. The movie than concludes with a big ol' sky beam and a wave of faceless drones the heroes can smash through with no moral implications. All the same old superhero stuff that we have no shortage of right now or when this came out. Heck, 2014 had 3 better Marvel Superhero movies come out as well. ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", ""Winter Soldier"" and ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"". The only thing this brings to the table is the fact its animated.But, if you're a kid and haven't seen a dozen different movies that follow these same beats, you'll likely enjoy this. The action is well animated, the jokes are well timed, the music is good, and the characters can be a lot of fun. That's why it's ""Big Hero 6 out of 10"".",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A fantastic movie for all ages!,"Wow...just wow! When I went to see this movie it was a late evening screening so there were no children, only adults. How we all loved this movie! We laughed, we cried and we were amazed.First of all: the animations are absolutely amazing in this movie! Every hair, every detail, water, fire, you name it; I caught myself wondering at times how they made everything look so natural!Then the plot; though the overall storyline is not that original, the way they built the characters around it and still gave the story it's own unique personality is brilliant. This was one of those movies that I didn't want to end just because it was so fantastic.One of the most important reasons I loved this movie so much is the humor in it. Especially the way Baymax learns and still tries to remain true to his original programming had me to tears (from laughing) several times. And not just me; the entire (adults only) cinema was bursting out into laughter!Whether you go with kids or not; I guarantee you will have a great time seeing this movie. I will definitely watch it again and recommend it to everyone I know! Instant happiness :-)",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Cute,"The plot is just so-so, but the Baymax is so cute. Many people have such a person in their lives. He brings you the most precious and beautiful memories in life.

"Big, bright and cheerful, even if it doesn't manage its heart well, and ultimately turns into another Marvel film for the second half","I watched this film at a strange time in terms of its reception; before its Oscar win it seemed to be a film that most people enjoyed or really enjoyed, however once it won Best Animated Feature, there seemed to be quite the backlash against it. I tried not to pay too much attention to either camp and went into the film for myself. The plot is driven by a device that seems to be quite common and one that more children's films are using – which is death and loss. In this case we have the main character and main villain motivated by the loss of a loved one, and this is what leads them to their respective points. This is something that can be tremendously impacting and also done very well (How to Train Your Dragon 2, for example) but in this case I thought it was a bit too much, too soon – introducing darkness for children, but only being a plot device to adult viewers. I guess the good thing is that at least it occurs early in the film so is out of the way.From here we get some nice comedy with the lovable Baymax as well as a superhero origin plot, although by far the former is better than the latter. The film from here is much brighter and funnier than some would suggest, and I generally enjoyed what it did, even if it still continued to really be able to balance the heart of the piece. This balancing act is pretty much forgotten by the final third, where it becomes much more a Marvel film than a Disney one. Feeling a touch like Captain America or some film like this, the action sequence and rapid movement is engaging and entertaining, but it does feel like just another action movie whereas the first half of the film felt like much more of a family comedy. These conflicting tones and contents never really gel the way they should, but mostly it works.Technically the film is astounding. The animation is fantastic in its scale and detail, from the expanse of the city through to the smooth, soft likability of Baymax himself. Okay Hiro looks far too much like he is the lead from How to Train Your Dragon, but otherwise all the characters and action is very well delivered. The very high production standards, good comedy moments, and fast-moving energy in a simple frame all do produce a perfectly fun and entertaining film on the whole, but it is one I enjoyed watching rather than one I would rush back to see again and again. The use of loss and death never feels like more than a plot device, and the heart of the piece is a lot less evident than it would have been in a better film – which is not to say I did not enjoy it for the things it did, just that it is a lot more limited than we have come to expect from huge budget animated family films.",,Anonymous,Animation
Great Movie,"This movie, if you haven't already seen it is a must see in my opinion. I grew up watching Disney movies and i recently haven't watched any of the new titles they have been releasing. But i sat down and watched this just because nothing else was playing and i was not disappointed. It was really nice to see the Japanese concept i feel like they haven't touched on the Asian community since Mulan. I would love to give this movie a 10 however compared to the lion king and Aladdin it takes the silver. The only thing its missing to be a truly great animated Disney flick is of course the musical numbers. Other than that this movie is defiantly one i must add to my collection worth every penny and time.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Another Great from John Lasseter,"3 February 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Big Hero 6. With an Executive Producer like John Lasseter, whose name can be found on most of the well known animated films from, Toy Story, and Cars to the mighty success that is Frozen, you just know this is going to be another great. Great it was. These days it seems if you can find a good story you can make an amazing animation. Set in the futuristic yet oddly homely city of San Frantokyo, this is the story of Hiro, a brilliant 14 year old who is devastated after the death of his brother. Together with Baymax a health robot created by his brother, Hiro discovers dark deeds afoot and he uses his exceptional mind and some good friends to help save the day. The modern animation never ceases to amaze me how it can stir as much emotion as an live action feature. Take the opening 15 minutes of Up for example, if that doesn't make you reach for a hanky then there is no heart in you. This film is the same, you feel sorrow and it makes you laugh. I was advised to sit through the credits until the very end to see an extra, and in doing so I learned a flew things.....the amount of people needed to produce an animation is just as many as a live film, there is even an animator in charge of crowd scenes, and the sound was managed by Skywalker Sound out of Marin County California. Oh and the extra I was telling you about......let's just say......roll on the sequel.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

I think most people loved Baymax, judging from all the laughs at the cinema. :)Overall, I would definitely go see big hero 6 again. The action had me on the edge of my seat and the plot twists were great. However, I wish Dan and Phil's characters could have had more screen time, but nonetheless their parts were enjoyable.

Baymax will be your new favorite thing this year,"2014 continues Disney's animation streak with the Marvel comic adaptation Big Hero 6. Big Hero 6, set in the fictional metropolis of San Fransokyo, tells the story of Hiro Hamada, a prepubescent robotics inventor who teams up with a group of college grads who are blurring the line between science and magic to fight crime in their beautiful bustling city as the superhero team Big Hero 6. Hiro and his hipster friends comprise 5 of the 6 members of Big Hero 6, with the 6th member being one of the most lovable robots to grace the screen in years; Baymax. Baymax is a big plushy healthcare robot whose adorable naivety and soft squeaky appearance will make kids fall completely in love, and they'll be raving about him until their parents buy them that $80 Baymax action figure. Well played, Disney.By no means is Big Hero 6 just a well marketed cash grab that will lead to countless toys, video games, and probably even TV shows. Yes, it most certainly is that because Disney has a job to do, but Big Hero 6 is first and foremost an exciting CGI adventure that never lets up on the action, the humor, or the spectacle, and even carries enough emotional weight to well up a tear or two. Just like its robot protagonist, this movie is just plain lovable. It's enjoyable from start to finish in almost every aspect.The CGI is nothing short of astounding, as is to be expected from Disney. The design in everything from the art, architecture, and especially characters is fantastic. The city of San Fransokyo is one of the more beautiful cities ever rendered, but the beauty of the scenery doesn't even stop there as our characters visit mysterious islands and mile high worlds of air balloons, all providing unique and constantly changing visuals. The technical work of Big Hero 6 deserves an indefinite amount of credit for the world pulled off here.And if you're not falling in love with the scenery you're hopefully falling in love with the characters instead. Each unique character comes with their own wildly entertaining personality fueled by a cast of fantastic voice actors including Ryan Potter, Damon Wayans Jr., Genesis Rodriguez, and Silicon Valley's always hysterical T.J. Miller. 30 Rock's Scott Adsit, with the help of some voice modulation, provides the voice of Baymax, whose voice has just enough robotic charm to be one of the most believable and adorable AI's in years.My only issue with Big Hero 6 comes in its writing mainly, and in part from its story line. There were a number of times where I was reminded that I was watching a kids movie when characters would do things like reiterate points from before, just to make sure the audience hadn't forgotten. There were moments when things were over explained and over emphasized so that everyone was able to keep up. The fact that this is a kid's movie makes these little screenplay transparencies slightly more forgivable, but they still irk me. The story holds strong for the majority of the film, but the third act introduces some elements that seem to come out of nowhere and could have used more setup to allow them to carry more weight, All in all it works though, and the film ends on a great big happy note that sets the stage for endless franchise milking.Big Hero 6 is worth the watch, no matter what issues it has. It is a solid 102 minutes of fun that will astound you visually, make you laugh genuinely, and might even draw up some tears at the beautifully sentimental moments between Hiro and Baymax. Disney continues to strike gold at their animation department, and I have a pretty damn good feeling this isn't the last we'll see of Baymax and the rest of the Big Hero 6 team.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
What did you expect?,"Reading some reviews of this movie I noticed that some of them went into tens of paragraphs and some reviewers stood on a soapbox spewing bile and insult over the movie itself and Disney. I think all the reviewers were probably adults. If you ask ANY child 12 or under to review this movie all of them would say how marvellous it is. Children take this sort of thing at face value,and take away the politics and personal gripe out of it. This is a gem of a movie if taken in context.Some people even took time to spot all the goofs and one even went into mathematical equation to prove a cgi character could not possibly pick up a large box. Incredible to think the lengths people will go to to vent their inner anger.

"Uninspired, Unoriginal, and Uninteresting","I hate this movie for having one of the most cookie cutter plots imaginable, and for trying to build tension where there is none.I am tired of kid's movies trying to be something their not. You can only have so much drama, because only so many things can possibly happen in a kids movie. This isn't 'Breaking Bad' or 'Django', BayMax isn't going to snap and kill anyone. I just won't happen ever. So why would the movie pretend it could happen.All this fake drama that leads to nothing makes for a very boring and hollow movie. The LEGO movie got it right. They realized it can't be dramatic but it can be fun. This movie took it self way too seriously, and it resulted in a very boring and mindless film.As far as the plot goes it's basically the same as every superhero origin ever made. Except now you've already seen it dozens of times. Add that to the fact that there is no longer any real tension and you end up with a very boring movie.Kids might enjoy it, but if your old enough to read this, don't waste your time.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
How to Train Your Robot,"An animated feature by Walt Disney Studios, ""Big Hero 6"" revolves around 14 year old Hiro Hamada, a vaguely Japanese robotics prodigy whose inventions are stolen by a mysterious masked man. With the help of a medical robot called Baymax, Hiro attempts to solve this crime. Assisting him are a band of super-scientists, each armed with high-tech gizmos.Wholly derivative, ""Big Hero 6"" plays like an amalgamation of every animated feature released over the past ten years. Almost every character is a wisecracking, manically animated attempt at ""cool"", family members die on cue, villains are predictably revealed and the film's last act rolls out the usual heroic sacrifices and false deaths. Throw in obligatory ""flying sequences"", ""musical montages"", ""canned sentimentality"", generic ""action sequences"" and several moments done better in other recent animated features (""Megamind"", ""Summer Wars"", ""Iron Giant"", ""The Incredibles"" etc), and you have a film almost entirely devoid of imagination.Computer animated features allow for a level of hyper-control almost impossible in conventional films. Every ray of light, every colour, every camera movement, can be fine tuned with machine precision. Despite this, the virtual choreography of ""Big Hero 6"" is mostly unimpressive. The film's aesthetic – manic, overly busy, graceless, no scene allowed to breathe – is itself annoying; like listening to a sugar-addicted 5 year old yell for 90 minutes. Like most recent animated films, ""Big Hero 6"" struggles to be both action adventure and anti-violence sermon. It contains one neat bit of conceptual design: a marshmallow-shaped inflatable robot.6/10 - Better recent animated films: Chomet's ""The Illusionist"", Hosoda's ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"", ""Summer Wars"", ""The Secret World of Arrietty"", Oshii's ""The Sky Crawlers"", ""From Up on Poppy Hill"" and Yeon Sang-ho's ""The King of Pigs"".

Action-packed and visually impressive,"I thought that this was a good movie with cool characters, lots of action, and a few nice emotional moments.The bond between main character Hiro and the likable Baymax was well-played out by the creators of this movie. The other characters - who functioned as assisting superheroes - expanded the action in the fights with the masked super villain. Near the end of the movie, it is explained that the main villain's motives are based on a personal tragedy and that gave the movie a nice touch. The visuals of the movie are stunning due to lots of details and expressive coloring. I think that the movie looks even better than Frozen for example. The setting of the movie is an interesting mix between Tokio and San Fransico. My biggest complaint with the story was that the ending scene seemed rushed and couldtherefore be a bit confusing for some viewers. The story was also a bit predictable as is often the case with movies that target children. Other than that, Big Hero 6 is a good movie that would appeal to most children below 12 (especcially boys).",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Who wouldn't want the ultimate best friend?,"I have always loved animated films, whether they be by Walt Disney, DreamWorks, Marvel, Miyazaki or any other storytellers out there, but of late I haven't enjoyed the anime style and artwork that has been delivered. Personally I thought Frozen was so over rated, sure there was a couple of good tunes, cool, characters, interesting storyline, but it lacked that special something Mr. Disney and his crew always managed in years gone by to bring out in me. Don't get me wrong I do really like frozen but nowhere near as much as I am supposed to according to everyone else on the planet. I'm not sure what it is that I love about animated films or where the love developed from but I find myself far more attracted to them in my later years than I ever did in my earlier life. So when I heard about Big Hero 6 and the fact that both Disney and Marvel were collaborating together I pretty much had instant tingles, my expectations without seeing a single thing went higher than any film I have anticipated before. What the hell was Big Hero 6 and why hadn't I heard of it up until now?!? Why did I ever stop reading the comics!?!?Hiro Hamada is a young 14 year old boy genius who knows how to make things work, he loves his gadgets and robots. Hiro lives in the futuristic city of San Fransokyo with his brother Tadashi and his aunt who has taken the boys in after the loss of their parents when Hiro was three years old. Hiro spends most of his days creating and then destroying robots in underground robot battles for cash, the robots he creates devastate the competition without any mercy. After being arrested for attending one of these illegal battles Tadashi on the promise of taking Hiro to another back alley for another fight detours to his university where Hiro discovers that the genius gene doesn't fall far from the tree at all. Tadeshi introduces Hiro to his five Uni friends who each are working on their own scientific breakthroughs. Wasabi, Go Go, Honey Lemon, and Fred. Tadeshi then shows Hiro his latest work, a personal walking talking health specialist named Baymax who can cure all with his sweet soft tones and loving temperament. Hiro instantly loves what he sees within the university and decides he must attend. To get into the university the heads of the campus hold a special talent show where potential applicants can show their work and hopefully the university board are convinced enough to sign up the entrants giving them a scholarship to attend. Hiro creates a way to revolutionise life as we know it and wins his way into the university to the joy of everyone. While celebrating and getting ready to leave a tragedy strikes the university and Hiro loses far more than his exciting new project. With the help of his new five friends from the Uni Hiro reinvents Baymax and together the team of 6 become heroes ready to find the truth to what really happenedI thought this film had it all, I loved it from its beginning to its after credits surprise. I laughed pretty much all the way though, Baymax really grabs hold of you by your heart strings, you can't help but fall in absolute love with him. The way the animators make him move and react is adorable and will definitely keep you smiling throughout. The animation is outstanding and deserves so much applause, everything from the 3D art work to the colour to the rendering is perfect, there is nothing to pick at here in the way the film is made. The voice acting isn't any different either, the directors Don Hall and Chris Williams have chosen an amazing cast and all do a fantastic job for their individual characters as well as their group dynamics, with a couple of recognizable voices amongst the fray as well you will totally love everyone. Staring the voice talents of Scott Adsit as Baymax, Ryan Potter as Hiro, Daniel Henney as Tadashi, T.J. Miller as Fred, Jamie Chung as Go, Damon Wayans Jr. as Wasabi, Genesis Rodriguez as Honey Lemon, James Cromwell as Robert Callaghan and Alan Tudyk as Alistair Krei. It's a film that really surpassed all my expectations and hopefully will do the same for you. If I had to pick on one thing the story was a little weak and predictable but not enough to concern anyone, you will still thoroughly enjoy every second of Big Hero 6.Big Hero 6 is a compassionate feel good loving caring and fun time adventure you're entire family will love.

I'm not going to say any spoilers, because some people haven't seen it yet, like some of the girls at my school. My favorite character is Hiro, its not just because he is smart and nerdy, but the guy who plays him (Ryan Potter) is really cute. If there is a next movie I think that, Hiro should fall in love and somebody kidnaps Baymax to make it more interesting. Big Hero 6 is amazing and I can't wait for the sequel.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not truly enjoyable,"Yet another dazzling mega-production that kept me wishing ""if only they had a plot to match the visuals"". Baymax is the main fun character who brought the most smiles with his awkward beginning and big heart at the end. Fred also has his moments but the rest of the characters were fairly dull. I couldn't relate to Hiro because he is too much of a genius with too little compassion. He turns around in the end for no apparent reason. Nothing in the plot surprised me and I kept wishing for less action and more personality--which is my typical reaction to most superhero movies. I like to see difficult challenges overcome, not merely a villain out-gizmoed, out-smarted, or defeated by stronger willpower. There is little character development here, just faster wits and superior technology.",,Anonymous,Animation
This movie is great for all ages,"This movie was awesome and appeals to anyone comic book fan or not. You learn to love and care for every character. Baymax is also a great role model for kids. He shows a large, huggable posture that can really be a cool mascot at Disney parks or events for all to enjoy and remember when ""I saw that movie"". Also, Hiro shows you to never give up, no matter what happens along the way. Just stay positive and keep your friends close to help you. It truly deserves an excellent review, even with all the odd hate. This movie was right on the dot for comic fans, fans of comedy, or just people looking for a good movie to see. It's still out so get to the nearest movie theater quick.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Watch out for Stan,"It starts off with young Hiro Hamada taking part in underground robot parts in San Fransokyo. Hiro's brother Tadashi wants him to do something useful and get away from the lowlifes involved in the robot fights.Hiro is introduced to a giant medical robot Baymax that Tadashi is developing at university and is introduced to Professor Callaghan, the head of robotics. Hiro creates microbots that he brings to a science fair to impress the professor and enrol at the university. A shady businessman is interested in buying the micropbots off Hiro.When a fire erupts at the science fair Tadashi dies trying to save the professor. Some time later Hiro, Baymax and a solitary microbot battles with a masked man who made a copy of the microbots. Hiro suspects that the fire may had been started deliberately in order to steal the microbots.Hiro teams up with a group of clever students who were friends with his brother and they use their skills to become superheroes to stop the masked man.Big Hero 6 is based on a Marvel Comic character. It blends its animation style with Japanese Anime. Kids will lap it up, Baymax who looks a bit like the Michelin Man is the moral heart of the story as he drums an anti violence message to Hiro.However this is another Disney animation that almost seems like by the numbers with the predictable twist when it comes to the reveal of the villain.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

A light-hearted alternative to today's all serious Superhero Movies!!,"There are good animated films, there are fell-good animated films and then there are award worthy animated films. Well the Big Hero falls short of the third category due to some of the much ovious takes on the twist and turns of the film. It is a must watch for any animation enthusiast looking for a change from the all serious superhero movies coming out from the comic book biggees nowadays. There is a boy and his elder brother and a robot involved in the entire storyline facing the all time mage villain attacking the town. A casual weekend watch to have some laugh and fun.

Uninspiring,"The story line was all over the place, and we couldn't get on board with the lead character(s)' quest, probably because it kept changing throughout the film.About halfway through we realised it has plateaued and wasn't going to get any better.Appreciate kids might enjoy it for us adults it just isn't funny. We found it boring to the point we were glad when the end credits started to roll and wished we had watched something else instead.There are so many better animated films out there, watch one of those instead.",,Anonymous,Animation

Although Disney is more into magical things. Through the years technology have been a theme Disney is developing more and more.

Delightful Adaptation of an Obscure Comic,"In 2014, Disney released their 54th animated feature Big Hero 6, a film adaptation of a relatively unpopular comic book series by the same name. Alongside being critically acclaimed, scoring big at the box office, and winning the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, what people took away from the film was how Disney did something different, adapting a superhero comic into an animated feature. I myself loved this film back when it came out and even called it one of Disney's best....now I personally just find it good but a little overrated.As usual for Disney, the animation is simply breathtaking. The film is set in the fictional city San Fransokyo, a blend of San Francisco and Tokyo, and the very design of it just spills imaginative. I'm sure anyone obsessed with modern Japanese art and central Californian life will go nuts over the amount of details and buildings created for the somewhat futuristic city. Along with a city that could only be made for a comic, the characters themselves look like they were made for a comic too given their stylized and exaggerated designs. However, the true highlight of the animation are the multiple representations of robots, technology and special effects, and the animators certainly let their creative juices go to great use in crafting the multiple mechanics and graphics used for the film.That being said, the story itself is nothing all that special. It centers on robotics prodigy Hiro Hamada, who lost his brother, Tadashi, only leaving behind Tadashi's robot made with the sole purpose to aid people in need. After some shocking events catch on, Hiro transforms Baymax and his other friends, Go Go Tamago, Wasabi, Honey Lemon and Fred into a band of high-tech heroes. It's not hard to figure out the outcome, and most of the characters aren't all that memorable. Gogo is the tough athletic girl who's into speed, Honey Lemon is the bubbly chemist, Wasabi is the wise albeit neurotic laser enthusiast, and Fred is every stoner comic relief in the book....but I'd be lying if I said I didn't find him funny. Also, without giving much away, the reveal of the main villain is pretty obvious, although his motivations are built on vengeance from a horrible tragedy, so at least he has a decent reason for wreaking havoc.However, I will say that the relationship between Hero and Baymax is the most heartwarming aspect of the entire feature. Considering that Baymax is built to help people, it makes sense that he would help Hiro in need. Even when Hiro wants him to fight back, deep down inside Baymax knows that murder will never bring Hiro's former sibling back. It truly is touching to see the only remains of Tadashi left simply want to make Hiro move on from a horrible tragedy, as I'm sure anybody dealing with the loss of somebody could relate. Not to mention, Baymax is absolutely adorable, from his squishy design, to his subtle robot movements, to even his caring charm that would make one wish to be his patient.So in conclusion, while I don't think Big Hero 6 is quite as good as most people have made it out to be, I still deem it an entertaining and at times emotional superhero movie that's fun for the whole family. Even with a predictable plot and some two dimensional characters, there's enough fun action, humor, heart and eye popping animation that make it worth a view. Since Disney bought Marvel in 2012, people have been wondering if this film will get an installment in the MCU...well, here's their chance to do so. With a potential TV series soon to have more episodes (it's just being delayed, it hasn't been cancelled) and a rumored sequel, there's always potential for further development of this world and its characters in the future.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"No adults please, this is a kid's movie","As a single senior with no kids to accompany me to this well received animated wonderment, I was confident that this movie would entertain me in the same vein as The Lego Movie and Wreck It Ralph.

This is a kid's movie...period. Intense color, action, no logic to the story elements, just a kind of psychedelic splattering of stream of consciousness video game dream sequences. Over 18? Beware the waste of your movie dollar. Under 18? The action, state of the art animation, and absolute childlike fantasies brought to life, it's beyond lovable.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Big Hero 6,"Big Hero 6, a well rounded and fun animated action movie with some strong moments but a overall lack of characters that engaged enough with me to make me like or care for them. Especially Hiro being flawed.Directing, as expected really good, I love the little alternate universe of San Francisco they've made, just wish the world had a little more done with it. It's a nice set piece but not much else, there's no real depth to it what makes it different. Overall action directing as expected is really good.Music, fine but not memorable really. Bit generic.And generic is what the movie tends to lean to, only regading the characters though. With exception to Baymax which singlehandedly saves the movie with great writing, plot and just as a character in general. It's odd you are made to care more for the robot than care for the real humans in the plot. That's also my major annoyance, the side character, the friends of hero especially feel somewhat tacked on. Their set-up is done and completed but they don't add too much besides having their specialization to show off. But the big problem lies with Hiro. Imo, missing some character development. Especially his genius side comes so easy that he becomes just a helper to Baymax. He just never really connected with me enough to make his story moments impactful. Baymax on the other hand...well that finale, let's just say it's a John Lasseter special again.Plot was actually good, really enjoyed how they did the whole villain angle.Overal enjoyable but not so much memorable.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney is making Marvel movies now.. ? its great to be alive,"Big Hero 6 is another movie based on Marvel source material but isn't like others recently released.. this one is also a Disney animated feature. How to train your dragon 2 was previously my favourite animated film of the year.. that was until i saw this gem.The story follows a smart kid named Hiro who is suffering from kid depression after his brother is killed in a huge fire. This is where he meets Baymax, the star of the film and possibly my favourite Disney character since Olaf the snowman. Baymax is a big lovable idiot-type robot who was built to provide healthcare for humans. Hiro sees Baymax as a chance to get revenge on his brother's killer and with him and his new- found friends they embark on a journey to get justice.Some of the film's best scenes come from Hiro's attempts to turn Baymax into a badass fighting machine. This results in hilarious moments because we still have our big lovable idiot.. but now he has awesome superpowers, and i must say this kept me thoroughly entertained. The other characters were also awesome and each had their own personality traits but at the end we are left with the relationship between Hiro and Baymax, although definitely not a bad thing because as an audience we can never have enough Baymax.I did feel that this film suffered from what Guardians of the Galaxy also suffered with which is that the villain was underdeveloped, although unlike Ronan the villain in this film (no spoilers) did have a fleshed out plan and was quite a surprise twist. In the end I came out of Big Hero 6 feeling satisfied and entertained, featuring the humour of Marvel and the heart of Disney, this one is well worth a watch for people of all ages and if you don't want your own personal Baymax by the end then something must be wrong with you!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"An enjoyable, fun application of the superhero formula","The superhero model gets a family-friendly animated application in ""Big Hero 6,"" the long-assumed byproduct of the Disney-Marvel partnership come to fruition. Not that these young children weren't already seeing Marvel's live-action heroes, but this way Disney- Marvel can hook them on superhero tropes at an even younger age.Older kids and adults, however, might also find the world of San Fransokyo engaging and charming. The story follows boy genius Hiro (Ryan Potter), who is wasting his potential in the underground robot-fighting scene until his brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney) takes him to his high-tech university and introduces him to his nerdy-but- cool friends and professor. Inspired, Hiro creates an amazing invention to gain admittance to the school, but when it's stolen and used for evil, Hiro sets out with his brother's healthcare robot, Baymax (Scott Adsit), looking for answers.Writers Robert L. Baird and Daniel Gerson (""Monsters University"") and Jordan Roberts roll most of the superhero origin story conventions into their reimagining of this team of lesser-known Marvel characters. Hiro is the main character who has suffered great trauma in his formative years (Batman, Spider-Man) who is a technological genius capable of building awesome robots (Iron Man  and also Batman and Spider-Man). So the movie doesn't tackle anything new for this genre, but it does package themes of loss, friendship, family and heroism into a form that children can digest.The objective is not all that different from Disney and Pixar's 2004 collaboration ""The Incredibles,"" but the difference is ""Big Hero 6"" feels much more modern and ""The Incredibles"" more ""classical"" as far as superhero movies go. Directors Don Hall (2011 ""Winnie the Pooh"") and Chris Williams (""Bolt"") create a vibrant hybrid city in San Fransokyo and let nothing hold back the imagination. Their story is steeped in the tech-driven superhero world, and even though completely implausible, doesn't feature characters with special biological abilities (like ""The Incredibles""), only smart characters that are driven and motivated (who have really good access to tech).The soul of ""Big Hero 6,"" however, is Baymax, the tubby, inflatable robot who Hiro turns into a heroic fighting machine. With his prime directive being to care for those who are injured or unwell, Baymax has acute insight into Hiro's fluctuating feelings (in fact there's a running puberty joke in the film). He's also an unlikely hero in that he's a big softie who doesn't want to harm anyone. He's the best source of comic relief in the film too, especially compared with T.J. Miller's Fred, who is sort of the obnoxious, weird friend. To the script's credit, however, Fred has all the lines that wink to the adults in the audience about how closely this story adheres to the comic book movie formula.""Big Hero 6"" is a fun superhero adventure with a strong moral story arc. Although it throws some curveballs in terms of plot and emotions, nothing about it is all that surprising or original; it's a well-executed use of a reliable formula.~Steven CThanks for reading!

A Solid Feelgood Movie,"Welcome to San FranTokyo, where Marvelous action heroes are celebrated in a city with a distinctly Asian aesthetic, in an American fashion, with its unoriginal storytelling. This is not a criticism so much as it is to be expected with a Disney film, given its studio's long history of taking stories from other places and adapting them in artistic ways. In many cases this works astoundingly well for them, as with Sleeping Beauty and the gorgeous Tangled film. Efforts by the studio to do their own thing have had some mixed results, with such gems as Frozen, but even their best borrow heavily from outside lores. This is no more true than in Big Hero 6, which draws so much inspiration from Marvel characters that the cameo of Stan Lee is not so much as a comical glimpse as it is a required nod to the original artist.Again, this isn't necessarily a bad thing, as the ideas behind the story aren't taken shamelessly for their own, but are tastefully adapted into something that tells a story that addresses issues like depression and loss. As an example, It isn't very often that we see villains redeemed, even if they are still left with the consequences of their actions and in some cases, this happens in Big Hero 6.Meet Hiro, a boy genius with a penchant for getting into trouble, who is so smart that he is bored with the legitimate world to the extent that he fails to notice his brother is attending the premiere school for his specific interest - robotics. When he learns this, his interest is sparked, leading to his inspiring entry into the admission process. Not everything can continue this peachy keen for a movie to be entertaining, so catastrophe strikes, leading to the formation of a team of self-proclaimed geeks bent on stopping an evil mastermind whose only crime at the time was stealing Hiro's idea. All of this is filled with intense action and emotional tension as Hiro deals with feelings of loss and betrayal, with the help of a robot designed to help him.The movie is filled with positive themes, including sacrifice, companionship, acceptance and even forgiveness. When taken lightly, this film will leave you feeling good, just don't look too closely, or think too hard about the plot.There is no arguing the production quality is excellent, something Disney studios has been setting the bar pretty high on. Colour is vibrant and sharp, making every character and location distinct. Unfortunately, the is held back by an overall feeling of a giant merchandising commercial. There is no veiling the blatant attempts at pandering to specific audiences, and that feeling interrupts the flow of the film, slapping you in the face with unnecessary and illogical events or styles that don't further the immersion, but instead break it. This won't bother everybody, but for some, this may be an issue.Conclusion: A solid, light-hearted, film that, if taken lightly, will warm your heart.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A good film - it's just missing a couple of things that would've made it greater,"Cool animated superhero film, one that I think is good.There are moments I like about 'Big Hero 6' and moments I don't like quite as much. I'll start with the positive parts. The animation is excellent, as is the music (nice song from Fall Out Boy). It also has a fair amount of heart, not as much as the film intends to add but still more than most.Now for the lesser things; that aren't bad per se, just not as well done in my opinion. The plot doesn't feel like anything too refreshing, I feel it's a story I've mostly seen elsewhere; in a few areas it kinda reminded me of the sorta stuff you'd see in a Scooby Doo episode, at least in terms of the twists and/or antagonists. I, also, don't love the design for Baymax - making a character with no facial expressions or true emotion always makes it harder to get attached to them. I do like his purpose, mind.As for the cast, they're decent just not memorable to me. Ryan Potter and Daniel Henney are solid as Hiro and Tadashi, I enjoy their bond together. I'm struggling to remember any of the others though.All in all, a good film - it's just missing a couple of things that would've made it greater.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Disney animates Marvel with great, beautiful action","Disney steadily adds to its canon of superhero characters with the addition of Big Hero 6. Based on a Marvel comic, the film follows young prodigy Hiro Hamada and his friends as they inadvertently become a team of heroes set on saving their town of San Fransokyo. But instead of the usual fare of princesses and fairy tales, this time Disney lends it's magic by way of modern tech and high energy action sequences, all while keeping its heart in the right place.The film is story driven, and there is really a lot of story. Just as you think you've settled into all the things you need to know, more characters and backgrounds are introduced to further push it along. The general story is a simple and predictable one, once you've been introduced to all of the characters. They each serve a purpose and it's not hard to figure out who is there for what reason. But the film manages to feel fresh and new, all while being authentic to the superhero tropes.No superheroes would be complete without a worthy super villain to oppose them and Yokai will join the long list of dramatically menacing Disney villains. Of all of the outrageous characters in the film, he is the most visually striking, sleek and dark and formidable. He works as a nice counterpart to Baymax, who will undoubtedly be the movie's runaway star. Baymax's stark white and wholesome demeanor is a complete contrast to the villain's all black corruption. While Baymax is cute, Yokai is sinister, but he is smashingly smooth in motion. In fact, the whole movie is.The look of the film is quite a stray away from what you're used to from the company. Not since Oliver & Company has Disney's animation been in such a modern and urban setting. Flashy neon lights and billboards cover the big city and the lighting is always atmospheric. Colors shift between dark and moody and vibrant and romantic. Towards the end of the movie, you'll even see the most beautiful and unexpected cotton candy clouds. And the camera moves seamlessly through all of this, following the berserk flow of the film's many engrossing action scenes.When the film does take its breaks from literal high-flying adventure, it settles into moments of true sympathy and pathos. It tugs hard on the heartstrings, sometimes maybe even a little too hard, but all for good reason and to help up the anti. Not all of it works, as the artificial intelligence aspect goes for a WALL-E but doesn't quite hit it. And it would have been nice to see some of the other characters a little more, as not much time is spent on them even though they are thrust into the spotlight. Watching these newfound superheroes find themselves and their purpose is what it's really all about.This is Disney proper's first real foray into animated superheroes, arguably with the small exception of Bolt, but that's going down a different route. Here, the film borrows heavily from all of its Disney brethren. Marvel is the source material, so it's mark is inherent. But the film also feels a lot like Pixar's The Incredibles, and has nods to other stable sci-fi and action flicks like Lilo & Stitch and TRON. But this isn't a bad thing; it's not at all a rehash. Big Hero 6 uses these inspirations to show a new Disney like you've never really seen it, and it's enjoyable all around.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Disney does it again,"In 2013 Disney scored a massive hit with Frozen, a making over $1 Billion and was particularly popular with girls. Their follow-up is more boy aimed adventure and the 10-year-old inside me loved it.Hiro Hamada (Ryan Potter) is a 14-year-old tech genius who is wasted his talents on underground robot battles. He brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney) shows him the light and the potential good his talents might produce and gets him to apply for university. But like in many Disney films a loving family member dies tragically and during Hiro's grief he awakes his brother's creation, the medical robot Baymax (Scott Adsit). While exploring the street of San Fransokyo Hiro finds a masked man he believes is responsible for his brother's death and decides to upgrade Baymax to take on the supervillian.Big Hero 6 has everything you would want from a Disney film, it is funny, dramatic, emotional and action: it is the complete package. As you would expect from a Disney film the animation is of the highest quality imaginable, detailed, complex and very colourful. The action sequences are fantastic, fast and fluid and easily matches anything in their live-action counterparts. It is a thrill ride of a film.The emotional core of Big Hero 6 is the relationship Hiro has with his brother, how he put Hiro on the straight and narrow and that he suffers from his grief. He slowly develops a love for Baymax as Baymax becomes a part of Hiro's mission. This is well trodden territory for Disney and some of the point plots are predictable to anyone who has seen a lot of films or some of Disney's most recent films: but Disney does this formula very well, so you cannot fault them for that.Big Hero 6 gets its balance between the comedy and the drama absolutely right. The comedy is a great mix of wordplay and performance based to slapstick and physical humour. Baymax was offered both forms of comedy brilliant and he was fantastically lovable creation particularly with some of his running gags. The dramatic half of the story has plenty of weight as Hiro tries to figure out the mystery and lets his anger get the better of him when big reveal happens. The villain had an great look to him, dressed in black and wearing a hannya mask and his power has no limits.The heroes haves array of powers when they suit up in the armour and the training and development aspects of the film are very reminiscent to the first Iron Man film. Hiro himself has a Tony Stark quality to him as he creates his robotics. It was particularly refreshing to see that the team are inexperienced and make mistakes when they are called into action for the first time.Big Hero 6 is a delight for the whole family, being an action packed adventure and having excellent drama and comedy. I couldn't recommend it more highly.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

It was replete with happiness turned sadness then triumph with important lesson learned.

This hit Hiro hard yet he finds a new purpose when he discovers that the fire may not have been an accident.The real adventure begins once Hiro tries to find out the reason behind his brother's death.

However, there are a couple issues that prevent it from being perfect.First of all, the film looks amazing. This really uses its 3D animation to the fullest. The designs are awesome and so is the science being employed here even if it is out there. However, this is a world where this type of science is possible so I rolled with it. The film has a great score and soundtrack which really helps get you pumped especially during the action scenes. When this film gets going it's a very fun ride.However, what truly drives this movie is its characters. Now, the main character, Hero, I actually thought was rather bland. He was, by no means, bad, but I found him the weakest of the primary cast. Hero's friends are all awesome. You have a superhero fanboy named Fred, a neat freak named Wasabi, chemistry whiz named Honey Lemon, and an adrenaline junkie named Go Go Tamago. Wasabi and Tamago are especially awesome to me. Tamago reminds me of Raven from the Teen Titans animated series. Wasabi is my second favorite character. His jokes, to me, were hilarious and he can be a badass too.Lastly you have Baymax who is my favorite character in the entire film. He is hilarious, badass, and just very lovable. The way him and Hero play of each other is also very well-done. His design is also great. It's simple but effective.Now, I do have a couple issues with this movie. It is a Disney film and you can see their fingerprints on this. Some of the classic Disney animated tropes are here mainly in the beginning and the end. There is a character who you know is going to die the minute he's introduced. Also it's pretty easy to guess who the villain is. They try to throw you for a loop with who it is in the first half, but it wasn't that hard to guess. In the beginning it really came down to two possible people and I could easily guess which one it was long before we got halfway through which brings me to my next point.The villain himself I thought was weak. I love his costume, but, as a character, I didn't find him that interesting. He has a typical revenge motive which I find tired. In Disney films the villain's motive is usually revenge or to gain power. The motivation wouldn't matter as much if he had more presence to him. Disney villains of the past had flimsy motivations but they leave a big impact on you like Jafar, Scar, Maleficent, and so on, but he doesn't.Also, the ending could've been trimmed down a bit. There is one scene after they defeat the villain where they have to go save this one character that has only had one scene prior so we have no emotional attachment to. The scene only seem to have been there to have a heartfelt moment where you think one of the main characters is dead but he comes back almost immediately after which makes that scene pretty much pointless. Unless that character they save becomes important in the sequel I see not importance to that scene other than to have a token heartfelt moment that every Disney film needs to have.Overall, Big Hero 6, like Guardians of The Galaxy, is a fun ride that both children and adults can enjoy. The characters are memorable, it looks amazing, the action is good, and it has plenty of funny and heartfelt moments. If you like films like Guardians then definitely give this a look.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Simply AMAZING!,"An amazing Disney movie.Maybe the best one I ever watched. I have to be honest.The best Disney movie since well, maybe 'The iron giant' or perhaps any other great cartoon. Ignore the haters. Believe me, the haters are dumb. Because it's an action packed, funny, and emotional story with a great plot that you will probably enjoy with your family. It may seem cheesy at times. But you may not walk away unsatisfied. Really realistic animation, and amazing voice acting. Is it for only for children? Nope, I don't think so. I watched this with my younger brother, and we both enjoyed it equally. If you love to watch cartoons, and if you enjoy movies with great plots, and if you want to enjoy a hearty laugh ... This is a great bet. Believe me ... This is an amazing movie, that you'll enjoy with your family and friends.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Wow, every cliché in the book?","I just finished watching Big Hero 6 for the first time. I was stunned... by how many clichés were able to fit into one film. It's amazing how entire films can be made without a single original idea. Maybe I'm being too critical. But I don't think so.Take the ""E.T."" climax for example or the ""let's become superheros 'idea'"" or the ""my best friend's a robot"" or ""my parents are dead"" or basically anything else in the film. None of it's truly original. All the way down to the achingly bad ""San Fransokyo"" thing. There were a few times when I was genuinely entertained. The only problem is - that's not why I watch movies, to become a mindless garbage receptacle. I hate to admit it but what was said about Krei early in the film - that he basically cheats his way around science and only cares about money is EXACTLY where Walt Disney Studios is right now. I hate to say it but Disney is showing that it is not concerned with true art, only $$On the other hand, a truly beautiful work of art came out in 2013, from a real film studio with integrity Studio Ghibli. Did it get the credit it deserved? Not even close. If you want to watch an actual film that's worth your time, look up The Tale of Princess Kaguya. The Best Animated Film Oscar was stolen from Kaguya - if not bought off. Somehow it ended up with this piece of garbage? Big Hero 6? It's all about $$",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Big Hero 6,"The special bond that develops between plus-sized inflatable robot Baymax, and prodigy Hiro Hamada, who team up with a group of friends to form a band of high- tech heroes.Big Hero 6 is the first Disney animated to have Marvel characters in it as the story is inspired by the Marvel comic of the same name! Apparently we get Marvel movies in a form of Disney movies now: it is a good time to be alive! There's even a Stan Lee cameo! Life is good. A large theme of this film is science, how it could be use to help mankind and before the adventure even begins they make it look cool. What makes this film special is the relationship that forms between Hiro and Baymax. In fact, Baymax is one of the most lovable character I've ever seen in an animated movie, everything that come out of his voice and behaviour is hilarious. This bound that forms between them is what gives the movie its emotional core. We mostly have seen this movie before as it is a sort of amalgamation of The Incredibles, Iron Man, The Avengers and Terminator 2; but the movie is written and directed so well, is so funny, that characters are what drown you into it. Obviously this film is aiming children but the major theme being science it will appeal to all ages, it has this feeling of ingenuity which can influence and inspire children to make something special for mankind. This film tells a story that is realistic and that children can understand, sometimes in life certain things do happen and even though this is a fictional/fantastic movie there are a lot of human emotions to be felt; emotions that are not forced at all. It is good for kids to know that they're out there. Finally it has some quite entertaining action scenes however for an hour and a half long movie it also has some pacing issue, at one point I feel like the movie was dragging a little bit but then it goes on.Overall Big Hero 6 is a movie for the entire family in which everyone can learn something and be entertained",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
brilliant!,"Big Hero 6 was whimsical and wonderful and an absolute joy to watch. I've long grown out of kids' movies, so I stepped into the theatre with a cynical mindset and very low expectations, especially considering the recent animated movies Disney has put out- but it blew me away! It's gratifying to see that the entertainment industry is still capable of a feminist, racially diverse, culturally respectful movie that's all-around sweet, heartwarming, tear-jerking and funny, complete with humour that's neither crude, clichéd, degrading nor disrespectful towards any gender or race, and highlights familial love and friendship instead of the classic romance. It has has singlehandedly restored my faith in animated movies (and Disney). Kudos to Disney and may they keep producing animated movies of this quality.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"It's an above average animated film, and will be a lot of fun for anyone who is willing to overlook its flaws.","Judging animated films is significantly more difficult for me than other films because there is this inherent sense that animated films are made for children, as opposed to for adults. And that in reviewing animated films, standards should be different. Now while I do think that it does make sense for animated films to follow different criteria, I also think that at its core all films should have the same standards for quality based on some fundamental aspects of storytelling.My problem with Big Hero 6 is that it does not push the genre in any new or novel direction, unless you count giving your characters Japanese names a step towards globalization. Which on a side note, is probably the only thing Japanese about them. Now this might seem a little unfair, but this revolutionizing quality does consistently happen even in the field of animation. For example, Japanese animation greats such as Hayao Miyazaki or Satoshi Kon have been able to imbue their films with wondrous worlds and impeccably novel plots. We also see this in American animation such as in the films of Pixar, like Wall-E or Up or the Toy story series, in that they create fascinating narratives and fill them with insanely memorable characters. Even within Disney's own canon, they've been able to make some pretty good animated films. I wasn't a big fan of Frozen, but it did side step the trope of the princess needing a happy ever after with a man, so that was something. And even without all the novel plots and characterization, some films work so well just on their simplicity, like the French animated film from 2012, Ernest et Celestine.Instead, Big Hero 6 decides to be a cliché-filled franchise-potential-heavy superhero movie. Think: animated avengers but with teenagers and gadgets. Take the best and worst things about Disney and Marvel, and cram them into one movie, and that's Big Hero 6. While that does sound pretty cool when I say it like that, the plot does get exceedingly predictable and stale. To be fair though, Big Hero 6 does also do some things pretty well . The alternate world of San Fransokyo that the animators create in the film is really gorgeously animated, and so are all the other environments that Hiro and his gang explore throughout the film. Even the technology in the film, in Japanese fashion, is very meticulously designed and fun to see. And in terms of memorable characters, Hiro Hamada is a pretty distinct protagonist, in that he isn't like the normal passive character trope that is so common in animated films. I'm not that familiar with the original Big Hero 6 comic that this film was based on, so I'm not sure how much of Hiro's character was directly pulled from the comics, and how much was new for the film. The problem though is in the supporting cast, with every other character, especially the ones in Hiro's group, devoid of any characterization at all, apart from some silly nicknames.But what truly elevates this movie from being just a decent one is the character of Baymax. And he really is one hell of a character. If you guys have seen the trailers, Baymax is the name of the fat white marshmallow like blob machine thing that acts as Hiro's main companion throughout the film. I don't want to spoil anything, but Baymax steals every single scene that he is in, and there are a lot of funny gags and sweet moments that center around his character, in a sort of similar way that Groot did in this year's Guardians of the Galaxy. Baymax has a couple of similarities to Groot, not only in his function in the film as a show-stopping side gag, but partly also in his role in the plot in the second half of the film.So earlier, I said that I'm reviewing this movie in context of film in general. And in that sense, I do think there's a lot of wasted potential here. However, sometimes films work in ways that are independent of supposed objective criticism. Most of the time, we just watch movies to have fun, despite whatever overused clichés and predictable plots they may have. Sometimes those ARE the reasons we watch movies, because of that safe reassuring feeling that no matter what trouble may occur, everything's going to be fine. And sometimes that's enough in a movie.So when you walk into Big Hero 6, know that it's not trying to revolutionize the field of animation, know of its flaws and redundancies and clichés, and then let go of it all. And just have fun with the movie. Sometimes it's when we stop being overly critical, that we are able to enjoy what's right in front of us. Just like kids do.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Hairy Baby"" (says the robot petting the cat)","On the one hand I can understand why this film makes people uncomfortable.For starters it takes place in ""San Fran Tokyo"" (?) and the core premise for the story is that it is ""OK"" to start an animation film clearly targeted for kids with a double homicide.That does take some getting used to.Oddly like its subjects (kids who experiment) there is a lot of experimentation taking place here too.There are some things I have never seen before in an animated film and quite liked.Other bits did not work as well.Anyway, for breaking new ground, I gave it an 8.Maybe history will be kinder.

good origin story but problematic villain true identity,"Hiro Hamada is a young robotics genius in San Fransokyo. He spends his time in underground robot fights. Hiro's brother Tadashi takes him to the robotics team at his university mentored by professor Callaghan and shows him his inflatable medical robot Baymax. To get onto the team, Hiro creates a swarm of microbots. It impresses sleazy businessman Alastair Krei and he offers to buy them. Hiro refuses and then a fire engulfs the convention center. Both Callaghan and Tadashi are presumed dead. Using Baymax and a leftover microbot, Hiro discovers a masked man has copied vast numbers of his microbots. With Tadashi's friends and Baymax, they battle the masked man.This is a fun superhero animated movie. The colors are brilliant and the animation is top-notch. It's full of action and it's emotionally dense. Hiro is a reasonable lead. The rest of the team is even better. They are a memorable diverse group. Baymax is super cute. The villain is where the movie falls down a little. While the masked man looks cool, the twist reveal leaves a lot to be desired. There are a lot about the identity of the villain that doesn't make sense. I'm not going to comment further about that so as to not spoil anything. This is still a solid superhero origin story.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Greatest animation of all time,"Big Hero 6 was really funny, beautiful to look at, and very charming! The jokes are adorable, with a lot of hilarious scenes with Baymax(the whole theater erupted with laughter whenever the fist bump part came on) and plenty of clever dialogue from the other characters. The animation is very colorful and lifelike, with realistic character animation and unique action scenes and backgrounds. The film is not without its heart, as the charm of Baymax and the surprises will hit the mark in the soul. Overall, Big Hero 6 is a true phenomenon in animation with cute humor, imaginative visuals, a huge heart and some very cool surprises. This is the best animated film of all time!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"long, tedious, and not very funny","I am surprised of the high ratings here. This is not a very good movie. I watched it in a crowded afternoon theater full of kids and there was only maybe 2 laugh scenes both of which are shown in the previews on the TV. The kids in the theater were so bored at the end of the ~2hour movie they were looking for something else to do in the theater. This is another Disney outsourced flop that has all of the technical details of a great movie but no soul.Maybe I am too negative because Disney is coming off a truly great movie in Frozen. So you know they can do it, but this movie just never clicks. It is just forced like it was developed in an India animation sweatshop. Disney needs story tellers.I won't give out any spoilers because it is a good movie to kill an afternoon with kids but just lower your expectations and you would be better off to wait for the DVD.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Beautifully written, touching, and faced the hero with big decisions!","Where do I begin? Big hero Six is one of the best movies I've seen all year. In one of my previous reviews, I used the term over and over again that Disney has always done what it's done and should stick to that. And this movie has! Running Disney themes have this movie that gets me very happy with Disney. This movie as I said in my previous review brings us back from the god awful frozen. Very original and I'll bring this back from any any old tales or fairy tales, big hero six tells the tale of a young man's struggle to find the men who killed his brother.With great action scenes good moral values and enough strength and motivation in its stride it brings me back to good Faith with Disney. Constant Disney clichés that always want to make me watch this movie over and over again , with a side of no backtracking and no unnecessary characters brings us to believe that Disney's got it back again. This movies originality, good writing, and overall good happy feeling, got me believing that Disney can move on from its mistakes. Disney has shown that it can make a good movie again by showing that you don't need a musical and ridiculous characters to get little kids up and happy to buy your merchandise. This movie spoke to a wide variety of people and not just easily fooled little kids. This movie must've been a stowaway on the crap boat that was frozen and maleficent.This movie is a rare occasion of well done combinations of different elements (superheroes, Disney clichés, etc). If you lost your money to frozen watch this movie so you metaphorically won't waste it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hilarious fist bump Balalalala,"From the creators of Wreck-It Ralph (2012) & Frozen (2013), here comes another impressive animation that's as fabulous as the above mentioned films, continuing the recent success streak for the studio. Big Hero 6 is based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name. It is such an outstanding animation a whole family can enjoy.The story of Big Hero 6 is set in a futuristic city called San Fransokyo (a coinage of San Francisco and Tokyo), the scenery is amazingly beautiful.The protagonist Hiro, a genius in robotics, has a special bond with his older brother Tadashi's invention called Baymax, a cuddly balloon like inflatable robot, which is designed to serve as a personal health companion. The relationship between Hiro and Baymax is very touching. Who doesn't like this cute, kind, lovely, royal, cuddly human-like robot?The version I have watched is 3D but the visual effects are almost the same as 2D. So, if you don't want to spend extra money on the 3D version, 2D will be fine in my opinion.All in all, the animation is superb, the plot is interesting, the dialogs are humorous. I am a 13-year-old boy watching this movie with my family. We all loved it. This is the movie for all ages. Definitely, a must watch!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Cute, Pretty, Action-Packed, and Funny","Some may say Big Hero 6 doesn't revolutionize the superhero genre. While that may be true, it does the job much better than most superhero movies I've seen. There is quite a lot to love about this movie. The voice acting is spot-on, the animation is bright and defined, and there are some great jokes. I loved how they took a good portion of the film to set things up. I loved the villain's appearance, how he mostly stayed silent, only using motions of his body. And who doesn't love the mechanical marshmallow Baymax?The first scenes had some bad exposition dialog, but what really prevents me from loving the movie are the side characters. These heroes had little to do with the plot and had no development. The two dudes were very annoying, the least funny aspects of the movie. I wanted more characterization with the villain, but tbh, he's fine.Its a very solid movie, that I think both adults and kids will enjoy. I'm glad Disney is keeping quality up, and trying different things. Go ahead and see it in the theater.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"With parts of creativity, design, and fun, Big Hero 6 becomes a functional film of excitement and fun","Talk as much as you want about what kind of future we're leaving our children, I want you to consider how much we have now. We are in the middle of the biggest transition into machines (even more so then the industrial revolution years before) with more computers, more robots, and more information built into an interconnected system that is assessable to everyone. While I can't say this is making people smarter, it is certainly giving us a bigger chance to help others. The trouble with introducing new technology is that the inventor will assume that everyone will use it correctly. That is never the case.A good example is robotics. By skimming some old Popular Science magazines, I see many sketches and prints of robotics acting like our personal servants. We are now in their future (or our present) yet the majority of the tech is related to industry or toys, but no robot friends. I think the big issue with human-like robots is cracking the idea of programing the emotions of a human. How would you program love and hate in the simplest of terms. For now we're just going to have to step back and enjoy the newest cinematic robot creation in Big Hero 6.In the futuristic metropolis of San Fransokyo (a creative combination of San Francisco and Tokyo), a fourteen-year old prodigy named Hiro Hamada makes little fighting bots in street matches to make money as he's already gone through high school. He's rescued by his older brother Tadashi and taken somewhere where he can be appreciated; the robotics college where Tadashi goes. He meets some other students and is introduced to their Professor Callaghan (played by James Cromwell) who encourages Hiro to enter a show that could admit him.Tadashi introduces Hiro to Baymax; a inflatable health care companion whose duty is to help the sick and injured. For the college competition, Hiro invents a bunch of nanobots (robots that are really small, but work together to do big things) that catches everyone's eye. The excitement is worn off fast when a building fire destroys the nanobots and kills Tadashi.Hiro sulks in his room for a while and gets to know Baymax's abilities more. This causes the robot to accidentally discover that a villain in a Kabuki mask is making a ton of nanobots. This gets Hiro the motivation to build armor for Baymax to search for the man that may be Tadashi's killer.Big Hero 6 has the distinction of being the next Disney Animated movie after Frozen. It's a bad spot to be as most people are going to expect another major hit. Big Hero 6 managed to entertain me, but I doubt it's going to be Disney's most memorable. The best thing about the movie is the setting. San Fransokyo has a very awesome look that my inner child is screaming ""I WANNA GO!"". The balance of the American and Japanese cultures work well to the futuristic story of robotics.Speaking of robots, Baymax has so much of a nonthreatening and huggable design, I have a hard time imagining someone hating him. He's curious, gentile, and always wants to help people. He plays the pet to Hiro whose story is a good one; accepting loss and finding new purpose. He's smart, but not yet fully mature to understand the need to have friends. His friends consists of the other college students that Tadashi worked with and eventually become heroes with Hiro and Baymax. They have fun personalities, but were not given enough time to know them more. This story belongs to the boy and his robot.I'll give this seven Baymax robots out of ten. Though more time with the side characters would have been nice, Big Hero 6 has the mechanics to be an exciting, fast paced action that most families should see.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Technically Proficient and a Really Fun Ride,"Are we soon coming to a time when the truly life-like actions and representations of objects by animated films are taken for granted? I hope not.""Big Hero 6"" tells the story of a young boy and his robot. And I hope no one is taking for granted the amazing ""cinematic effects"" created via animation. These animators repeatedly fool the eye into thinking the images are created through the lens of a camera. To further this illusion, the point of view is what one might see through a camera. It is almost tempting to compliment the camera's movement, until you realize there is no camera. In the same vein, I love the ""shots"" through translucent (but not clear) glass, the slo-mo, and the depth of field created by ""unfocused"" objects in the background.The overall style of the film is reminiscent of anime and classic sci-fi. And it starts with a mystery that our hero (Hiro) cleverly--with the aid of a clue that is genius in its simplicity and design--sets out to solve.Time and again, the characters look and behave in very human ways. And since I am not yet ready to just accept such technical artistry as de rigeur, I say ""Bravo!""If you liked ""The Incredibles"" or ""Wreck-it-Ralph"", you will probably like ""Big Hero 6"".",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not Disney's best,"Since their merge in 2009, it was but a matter of time before Marvel and Disney made their own animation movie. Big Hero 6 is completely produced by Disney (with some members of Marvel's creative team), but the story is based on a Marvel Comics superhero team. This is the 54th official Disney Animation Studios film and thereby following last year's Frozen. Unfortunately, Big Hero 6 is too much Wreck-It Ralph (which I didn't particularly like) and too little Tangled or Frozen (which I fairly enjoyed). The Japanase manga iconography in an American production is probably the most interesting aspect of this film which takes place in the fictitious San Fransokyo. Besides that it was quite funny and had some truly interesting moments, but in the end it was all too conventional and missed the Disney components I like most (songs, a fairy tale atmosphere, talking animals or creatures,...). I understand there's a new generation of kids who are more acquainted with superheroes, computer games, flashy new technologies and the likes, but this movie sometimes feels like propaganda for Silicon Valley and that I can do without. The post-credits scene seems like a reference to the Marvel habit for announcing a sequel, but as far as I know I don't think this'll be the case any time soon. Hopefully Disney's next feature will be more my cup of tea again.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Fun, Action Packed and Adorable","""Big Hero 6"" is a movie that shows the best of both Disney and Marvel. It's funny, has exciting action scenes and has enjoyable characters.Baymax (Scott Adsit), the inflatable huggable healthcare companion for Hiro (Ryan Potter) was, for me, the best part of the movie. Baymax brings laughs in almost every scene he is in, has a lot of action scenes and you end up loving him. Hiro is the most developed of the human characters (he is funny, his actions, however rash and dangerous, are understandable and he grows and learns from his mistakes) and he along with Baymax makes the movie great. Although the other humans are all fun in their own way, I wish we got to know more about them.The villain in this movie is good as well. Just goes about his job doing evil stuff in an evil manner and is threatening throughout.My only issue was with the ending which unfortunately went as predicted.

Big Hero 6 (Out of 10),"This new Disney/Marvel movie centers around a 14 year old boy genius named Hiro (think Jimmy Neutron) who sets out on a mission to track down a man who stole one of his inventions and deeply hurt him in the process. He's accompanied by a group of zany ""nerdy"" friends and a rather large, cute inflatable robot named Baymax, and the story largely focuses on their relationship. They become more like superheroes as they strive toward their goal. You may be thinking, ""this sounds familiar"" and that's because it is. This movie covers territory that's already been treaded on countless times in recent years (in fact, it bore many similarities even to ""Guardians of The Galaxy,"" only this time for kids) and it really adds nothing new to the formula.And that doesn't make a movie inherently bad. There are countless formulaic movies that are still extremely enjoyable and touching, but this one simply misses the mark. Where this movie really went wrong is how it tried to balance its tougher, more saddening themes, with light-hearted entertainment. A good example of a movie that did this right is ""Up,"" which takes segments to solely deal with hard moments and let the audience be sad, and then it provides lovable characters and funny dialogue to make them smile later on. ""Big Hero 6"" tries to soften the blow of the tough moments by throwing in some silly humor here and there, which ends up cheapening the effects of both. It's never funny long enough to be considered entertaining escapism, and it's never serious long enough to actually say anything new about its darker themes (death, grieving, recovery--I know, some heavy stuff). It just sits in this awkward middle ground. And the plot, action, and characters are not entertaining enough on their own to sustain it, either. It's the typical learning to work together to conquer plot missions as well as emotional battles--Disney and other studios have been doing it for years and there's just nothing even remotely fresh about anything on screen.I know I'll be stepping on a few toes with this review. I don't think the movie is ""trash"" as another reviewer suggested, I just think it's nothing new and nothing interesting. There are still some amusing sequences, though (Baymax provides pretty consistent chuckles) and I didn't outright hate the movie. It just wasn't for me. If you're a parent of a hyped-up Disney fiend, then sitting through this won't be that bad and you'll even find yourself chuckling from time to time, but unless you're being forced to see it or really have nothing else to do, then I would stay home--maybe pop in ""Wall-E"" or ""Up"" or ""Tangled"" if you're really craving some modern Disney. Not terrible, but simply not worth the time or money.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

I really like science and stuff like that especially sci-fi (my best genre for movies), so I would probably say: ""The best animated movie I've watched in my life, EVER!!!"" I LOVE YOU WALT Disney!! A REALLY HUGE THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS MOVIE!!! <3",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Disney's Latest Gorgeous, Yet Formulaic, Offering","Despite any dissatisfaction I generally have with Disney's recent stream of films, they always deliver in the visuals department. There's no doubt that Big Hero 6 is absolutely visually beautiful, further pushing the boundaries of realistic animation. Everything from the subtle muscle movements to the utter skin complexion is ever more impressive. The vibrant colors of rainbow variety and the stunning attention to the setting's many details surely represent Disney's masterful technique and way of extravagance in animation.The movie opens up with an intriguing first thirty minutes that exposes the audience to a fascinating world of battling mini-bots and a genius 13-year-old kid who gets accepted into a prestigious science university —a white kid with a Japanese name, for whatever reason. Well, actually, this totally fictional city is part of an apparently hybrid world that blends Tokyo with San Francisco—a world that's never explained in the story but only clarified by the filmmakers themselves. Anyway, Hiro (Ryan Potter) shares a very intimate and encouraging friendship with his older brother, Tadashi (Daniel Henney)—two brothers perfectly getting along in a Hollywood picture. Who knew that archetypes don't always have to play a part in these stories? Tidashi is another talented scientific mind who has created a personal healthcare assistant in the form of an intelligent, useful marshmallow- like robot named Baymax (Scott Adsit). It's only later that some very exceptional code programs this innocently-designed robot to suddenly transform into a ""superhero.""As a matter of fact, Big Hero 6 does an outstanding job with character development—an outstanding job in properly fleshing out its multitudinous fun characters, especially in regards to turning Baymax into the sympathetic pet of the year and also giving life to a group of ""nerdy"" college kids who befriend Hiro along the way (all with their own distinct personalities, including T.J. Miller's usual dude-bro goofiness). Most of all, the story prioritizes the heartwarming dynamic between the kid in need of assistance, Hiro, and his new compassionate pet robot, Baymax.With all that being said, the story is largely formulaic and unoriginal as we've come to expect from Disney's recent crop of storytelling. A checklist is practically floating around, checking itself off with every emotionally manipulative moment and primitive, predictable turn. ""Okay, now smile; now laugh; now tear up; and now smile again!"" The ending is also very deceivingly sad and ultimately misleading...not unlike what Disney has done with every one of their endings as of late, including the Marvel ones. Either stick with your route or go with an alternative one instead.By now, it's become already apparent: gone are the mature, creative days of Pixar who consistently found a way to appeal both to adults and children, or even classic Disney who still had their inspired, magical tales to tell. Nowadays, you have predominantly juvenile comedy—solely consisting of body humor and outdated quips—that always gets the naively-minded mom and her exuberant child laughing off their seats. One can argue that Disney still makes entertaining pictures, but no way will I ever understand any adult that considers their animated work particularly humorous (like, say, the actually hilarious animated films we used to receive in Shrek or The Emperor's New Groove—I honestly think DreamWorks Animation just has a sharper sense of humor).",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Elated at movie, shocked at soulless reviewers","The last time I left a cinema feeling anything close to this elated was after Gravity. My heart was racing, I felt so joyful. I never feel like this after a film. Big Hero 6 immediately replaces the Lego movie as my No.1, main stream, animated film.I came onto IMDb to find out more about this entertaining, action packed, emotional roller-coaster only to see half a dozen vicious reviews ... I feel so somber. I can't believe anyone would loath this film to the levels of some reviewers have gone to on this site. It was an absolute joy. The whole cinema was ecstatic, both kids and adults.I have a 7 year old boy, and even without being a dad, I'd still love this film.

A Fun Break from Reality that Kids Should Enjoy,"I went to see ""Big Hero 6"" primarily because I'm a lover of all things comic book related, and Big Hero 6 is based off of an obscure Marvel comic book. I also do enjoy animated movies, though I must say that as someone who doesn't have children I probably have not seen as many animated films in the Pixar era as others may have seen.That said, I enjoyed this film immensely. Having not seen many computer-generated feature films like this one, I found the animation to be stunning. I'm sure that that's true of many animated features these days, but Big Hero 6 nevertheless impressed me with its attention to detail in every single pixel of the movie screen.In addition to the animation, the script was fun and a nice break from reality. I also can report that there's no need for any prior knowledge of the comics to enjoy the movie--something that was not as true for me when I saw ""Guardians of the Galaxy"". In the latter movie, I had zero knowledge of the characters and their mythology, and while the film did a fine job explaining, it also left me wishing I had known a little bit about the books going into things.""Big Hero 6"" is not like that. The story is clear and informative throughout, and the plot builds nicely into a good movie going experience. I would also say that the story told is fun and entertaining. One of the best parts of the film is the villain, who has a fairly unique super power (it could perhaps be compared to the ""Sandman"" character from the Spider-man books, but remains unique despite similarities).All in all, I'd highly recommend the film, with just one reservation: as fun as the movie was, I did find myself thinking that I had seen other animated films that I enjoyed more, and that's coming from someone who admits to not watching very many animated features. As such, I'd say this is a great movie if reviewed purely on it's own merits, but if one starts comparing to other Disney or Pixar films, it's possible that ""Big Hero 6"" may not top the list. Still, I'd say it easily deserves 7/10 stars.And do stay for the post-credits scene, especially if you are a Marvel Comics fan!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

This is the first animated movie Disney creates based on a Marvel property.Like other Disney films Big Hero 6 is a mix of action, drama, comedy and strong relationships between the characters I can tell you are going to lo love Baymax.Visually it's amazing, Disney animators are pushing boundaries with every new film. In some shots, specially those showing San Fransokyo streets you can forget you are watching computer generates graphics it looks so real. Also the textures like the hair of the characters is mind blowing.

7.5/10,"Entertaining and cute, the film is plainly irresistible, no matter how hard you try you will get caught by it and play along with it, until you will realize that what you were promised isn't in no way what has been given to you.In a year where How to Train Your Dragon 2 and The Lego Movie were released, to release a successful animated movie would be a big uphill battle, at which many have already failed, but Big Hero 6 manages to make it far above the average quality and produce some very well crafted entertainment for everyone of the family to enjoy. Yet entertainment is where Big Hero 6's success reaches it's peak. Unfortunately there is really no character as Hiccup or Emmet, no multiple layers to the story and no profound message we had with these other two movies. At no point in this movie I thought there was going to be more than I expected: it's very predictable, it plays to many clichés, it has some very generic scenes, characters and montages and doesn't take any risks of any type. Weakest of these points is the climax in which I was plain out bored, when it should have instead been the high point of everything.Yet, this is no to say that the movie has some big strengths, the biggest of them being the comedy. This movie is really funny, I laughed out loud a lot of times and to this contributed astonishing animation. From frame one I was surprised at the brilliance of it. Mainly because it wasn't only beautiful, but actually very, very smart. Unfortunately even here it didn't manage to beat the visual feast that were The Lego Movie and How to Train Your Dragon 2, but still that would have been something really hard. Moreover, as much as I talked about generic scenes and montages, there were some very good scenes, some great set pieces that had enough spice to keep me smiling throughout. Obviously the greatest element of this movie is Baymax, it was so pleasant to have such a captivating screen presence. He is so good that the robot in this movie might be the most interesting character.Very good flick, but slightly underwhelming, especially considering the amazing streak Disney Animation had had up until now.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Really has nothing to do with the original comic books,"Big Hero 6 is fun. There are plenty of plot holes, half-baked ideas and clumsy dialogue, but there are plenty of cool hero moments that will keep the kids entertained.

"A likable, funny and sweet film that introduces characters people will be happy to revisit.","Big Hero 6 is a film for children but adults will easily enjoy watching this animated superhero action-comedy too. In fact, it's so entertaining that it's easy to overlook that the story is practically incoherent. The typical lessons about sacrifice and the importance of forgiveness seem forced as well. But the characters are a distinct and likable group. There's been much talk about how cute and lovable Baymax (Scott Adsit) is. And Baymax is certainly a clever creation. Considering the robotic voice of this warmhearted machine it's a big success that Adsit never makes this simple character seem repetitive or boring. Baymax is such a likable character that one genuinely begins to care about the robot long before the film is over. The other characters, however, are just as interesting. It's a formula of appealing to just about everyone in the audience. I mean, of course, the Big Hero 6 team. The genius boy Hiro Hamada (Ryan Potter) suffers a big loss and goes on a compelling mission to find out what happened. With him are Fred (T. J. Miller), GoGo Tomago (Jamie Chung), Wasabi (Damon Wayans, Jr.) and Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez). They're cool characters. In the hands of the voice cast and directors Don Hall and Chris Williams they're often funny too. In addition, the comedy is surprisingly clever, going above what's usually shown in animated fare these days. Since the film is an origins story it's actually very similar to other superhero movies if you take a closer look at what's happening. But because of the setting, comedy and action (let's also not forget the fitting music by Henry Jackman) it's easy to overlook this. The city of San Fransokyo is a futuristic metropolis that just has to be seen. Like everything else in the film it's beautifully designed. The colors are bright and the designs are fresh. I guess it's no secret that the filmmakers drew inspiration from Japanese anime and Japanese culture. John Lasseter, who's been overseeing the projects of Walt Disney Pictures for years now, is known for being a fan of Japanese animation. He's honestly managed to improve the quality of Disney films. Bolt (2008), Tangled (2010), Wreck-It-Ralph (2012) and Frozen (2013) were all terrific, memorable releases. Big Hero 6 is no different, and it may be the craftiest, most appealing release yet. I recommend it.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fun and Family Friendly,"Is Pixar even capable of making a bad film? I ask that honestly. Every film I have seen produced by them I either loved or at least respected the precision of quality they give every production they do.Big Hero 6 is certainly no exception.The story of Hiro, a little boy who is into fighting bots who befriends, what was originally designed to be a health care robot, is touching, delightful and fun.Hiro puts together a team of his science friends who each have their own special talents which he catapults into super hero ""powers"" including ""upgrading"" Baymax, the health care bot.Together they try to figure out a whodunit and save the day.Hero, as well as his team, learn a lot of valuable lessons throughout their adventure and if you don't come away from this movie wanting your own Baymax I would be surprised.Although there are some darker moments it is nothing that would preclude little kids from enjoying the movie as the dark moments are not that bad and the movie as a whole is a family friendly experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"C'Mon Disney, if it wasn't for Baymax this would've been a dud!!!!!","Big Hero 6 is a cute animated film that will make you smile, even if it has one of the most unoriginal and worn out plots ever to exist in film.Set in the far future in the city of San Fransokyo is the setting for the Disney film Big Hero 6.Hiro Hamada is fourteen years old, he is also a prodigy. That is a bit of an understatement – he is a super wiz kid genius with a knack for robotics who graduated high school at the age of thirteen and even for the future, that's impressive.Hiro is smart which means one thing – he is bored and getting into trouble! His older and smart brother Tadashi wants to keep Hiro out of trouble. So, he piques Hiro's interest by showing him his work, a super high tech and innovative science lab at a top university. While there, Tadashi shows Hiro his latest creation: an inflatable marshmallow shaped health aide robot named Baymax. After a series of events, Hiro must turn to Baymax for help and in the process befriends the robot and a team of Tadashi's friends.The star of Big Hero 6 is Baymax and only Baymax. The robotic puff ball that is only concerned about its owners well being is the only original device in the entirety of Big Hero 6. He is sweet, funny and his character dynamic plays well with the protagonist Hiro's predicament. It's like the film's creators had an Idiot's Guide to Animated Films and followed the How-To in Chapter 3. The characters, the story, erry-thing is done and done better in an earlier animated film.Of course, children won't notice these glaring flaw of the film though the adults who pay for the tickets will and it will suck the fun out of the experience.

"It's decent, but ultimately disappointing","I am disappointed. That is not to say I hated or disliked this movie, but, it could have been much, much better. It never really took the extra step to make it spectacular, it just kept it simple. The jokes are pretty hit and miss, more so miss for me (younger kids won't care), and every emotional scene in this movie fell flat. I was never really invested, therefore I never really cared about what was going on. I know it sounds like I hated this movie, but it didn't do everything wrong.

Disappointing script,"Translated from Spanish by Google Translate.I do not understand how an animated film so well to get to become a disappointing script. Bee Movie was another disappointment for not contributing anything to the history of animation, but the quality of their work, as in almost all. We could add in the disappointments Up, for their atrocities in the script. But this one in question is totally cheap as the script. Superheroes friends, forgiveness friends ""superheroes"" are duller than I've seen in the animated screen. Boring and simpletons, highlighting ... The truth is that the four can excel in their work of originality. The only thing that can save the story is the protagonist child and the superhero robot, with a few gags are funny. The manipulation of history so that everything fits and ""good"" win the game and the ""bad"" is defeated is quite childish. Finally, and in short, perfect image and technology; suspense in the script and the characters.Ah, I forgot the character of ""aunt"" of the brothers, totally hated by simpleton. Minimally, but very minimally, the role of the evil, which is a character who is unsuccessful in most films of American animation, greatly highlighting the wicked from Disney saved.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
"They say we are what we are, but we don't have to be,","Disney and Marvel have had a baby, and it's wonderful. At the time of writing this, Big Hero 6 has won the Oscar for Best Animated Film of the Year, yet the amount of criticism I've seen here has compelled me to post my thoughts on this movie. Personally, I loved it.Based on a Marvel comic so obscure that even Marvel essentially forgot it existed, Big Hero 6 tells the story of Hiro Hamada, a 14- year old robotics prodigy whose gateway project to get into San Fransokyo's most prestigious technology university is stolen in the wake of a tragic accident. With the help of his new friends and his brother Tadashi's latest creation, an inflatable medical robot named Baymax, Hiro forms a team of misfit superheroes to see that justice is done and solve the mysteries that keep cropping up. The characters are just great. We take time to get to know all the major players and their quirks and foibles from Hiro, to the neurotic Wasabi and even Hiro's Aunt Cass. It's fun just having these people interact without even getting into any action. Though the star of the show is undoubtedly Baymax with his unthinking compassion, willingness to help those in need and sheer gentle, huggable nature. The world looks incredible too as a seamless fusion of East and West architecture and culture.The story? Some called it predictable, and you could argue so, but the villain (not giving it away here) was not who I expected it to be. Some would likely argue that Disney did the same thing with the villain reveal in Frozen, but that doesn't matter to me since I'm likely the last man alive who hasn't seen Frozen and I don't think I even need to since the whole thing's basically been given away by people who wouldn't shut up about it for a year. But I'm going off on a tangent... There wasn't a single moment in this film where I was bored. In fact the lengthier setup before we get to the hero- and-villain meat of the story actually helps, as we take time to get to know the players.Of course it's not perfect. No movie ever is, really. The music isn't that memorable with the exceptions of Fall Out Boy's Immortals and the score pieces Nerd School and Huggable Detective. And some of the dialogue towards the end is a teensy bit cringe-worthy, but, hey, it's Disney, you let it slide, especially when the movie's this much fun and emotionally involving. I personally can't wait to see it again.And this is still sort of a Marvel movie so don't forget to stay behind for the post-credits scene!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Makes Nerds Look Cool. ♦ 60%,"I enjoy animation movies not because they help us dive back into our childhood memories as cartoons, but because they often speak volumes about world issues. While Big Hero 6 doesn't particularly point at any issue, it may inspire children to embrace science and technology.It is basically a superhero film and as all superhero films go, it says almost one and the same thing. A bunch of heroes with powers defeat the villain. Period. In here, the story revolves around a teen who takes the help of his friends and a robot to avenge his brother's death.The bot Baymax is very adorable and children will love it. It is the only new thing that managed to intrigue me. How 14-year-olds manage to invent hybrid technological marvels is beyond my understanding, and that is why I do not appreciate the friendship of East & West here. The Japanization troubled me a little. The plot is about robotics, science, and ideas. Its audience will stay spellbound at how marvelously the writers have added color and creativity in the story. With a great comic timing, Big Hero 6 keeps you engaged on a thread.The chief issue it addresses is that of the perils of technology and how everything is based in the programming. The film, as a whole, makes nerds, an ilk mocked by many, look cool. It is nicely directed, has great sound effects, good score, and brilliant art setup.But, too bad, Big Hero 6 struggles with its clichés. The story goes literally unbelievable sometimes and slightly jumps the line as it starts its narration. Visuals effects reminded me of Spider-Man 3 and if you stop and think for a moment after the climax, the whole shindig looks like a goofy, child's play.BOTTOM LINE: Of course not the best animation movie of the year. The makers have evidently failed to acknowledge the fact that, since the boom of computer animation and its cinema genre in the 90s, animation films are mostly fables than comedy-dramas.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

"An extremely satisfying watch about innovation, family, revenge, and the future","Im more of a renter then a movie goer, and i watched this movie right after watching Interstellar, so i will always remember this sequence as probably one of the most satisfying weeks of watching new movies. The movie is well balanced (besides having no romance whatsoever), suspenseful, unpredictable, action packed, innovative, touching (even tear jerking) and beautifully presented with a fantastic ending (always important). There is a little bias, it is set in San Frantokyo and I reside in the bay area so i loved that part (because were kind of the center of the world over here), and its not a first time seeing the idea since they did something similar in Cloudy 2, but none the less it was done way better and way less dumbed down.I won't get too much into the story line, but the ride takes quite a few turns turns. Certain goals are made in the movie and once their met, a sudden turn is taken in an unpredictable way, making it pretty suspenseful. They also make an interesting connection between Hiro, his brother Tadashi, and Tadashi's invention ""Baymax"", the worlds first robotic health care companion. The other 4 of the 6 don't have the hugest role (similar to How to train a dragon), and their powers aren't amazing either, however, when needed they make a mark in the action scenes and in some of supportive situations as friends. There's no pure evil in the movie, always rationally fueled evil. And the fact that its futuristic, animated and about robotics and inventions, gave the staff plenty of potential for innovation and they did a great job with it.Once again the movie was so well balanced, and though i could see a girl maybe not liking this because there isn't romance, the connections between brothers and friends, and some of the other family references make it watchable for most people. It should be an additionally exciting watch for the older and perhaps nerdy type who can catch on with some of the technology and subtleties. However, even my GF said that some of the sadder moments were extremely touching. Once again, they use animation and futurism to their advantage with the touching scenes. The first Marvel Animation made under Disney and they start it off with a bang. It wasn't hugely advertised, and there was a large Asian influence on it Hence the city San Frantokyo which might be why it wasn't advertised greatly(Disney tends to do that) but I absolutely love this movie. I rented it again a week later, and i think i will purchase this one for sure (along with interstellar).",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Sweet at times, but reeks of bandwagoning and cashgrabbiness.","Disney seems to be having a third renaissance at the moment. Tangled may have relatively flew under the radar, known mostly for its notoriously ballooned budget, but it was a very pleasant surprise. Wreck-It Ralph is the best Disney film since the 1960s, and everyone knows the immaculate success of Frozen. Now that Pixar have taken a stumble, they finally compete with their close contemporary cousins. Now comes quietly Big Hero 6 with a soft landing rather than a loud boom. Are they trying to repeat the legs of Frozen? Nevertheless, it's a swing and a miss as far as trying to implement another film into pop culture despite their different appeals. Big Hero 6 is far too derivative of its inspirations from the comic book movies these days. Instead, it reeks of bandwagoning and cashgrabbing on the Marvel success to sell toys and make video games. It feels like the only reason it's a San Francisco/Tokyo hybrid is to sell Japanese tickets. Why can't they commit to one instead of shamelessly compromising?The intentions of the film are obvious, it's trying to get kids high on science and innovation, but it does it on the standards of Saturday morning cartoons. Granted, I did like the lead character a lot more than I expected, though it's annoying to have him be more magician than inventor. The film's emotion works and it's very sweet, though nothing new. Unfortunately I found its poster boy Baymax more irritating than endearing. Perhaps it's because I've watched too much 30 Rock and I'm used to Scott Adsit as Pete, but the conviction didn't work for me besides a few moments. Also the writers only seemed to put effort into implementing contradictions for two of the sidekick characters, incidentally both male. However, the pleasure of Disney is the detail in the nuances, an aspect which really improved in Frozen and is demonstrated here tenfold. Big Hero 6 is still an entertaining and ultimately poignant way to spend an hour and a half, but it doesn't live up to Disney's new standards.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Not Like the Comic, But That Isn't a Bad Thing","I'm tempted to say that children's movies or family oriented movies are getting better, but that would be tantamount to outright dismissing gems like The Dark Crystal, The Neverending Story, The Princess Bride, Labyrinth, The Secret of N.I.M.H, and so many other fantastic movies from my own childhood. So, even though the movies today might not actually be better as far as subject content and narrative are concerned, there are a lot more of them...and that makes me happy. Big Hero 6, which I just watched last night, was both sweet and adorable while simultaneously poignant with its handling of difficult subjects like the death of close family members and the grieving process. My favorite thematic element would be the focus on science and engineering as positive and pleasurable hobbies and occupations for children to pursue, a sentiment that is sadly underrepresented in the world today. Much like Frozen, Despicable Me, and Monsters Inc., there isn't much that I could complain about where Big Hero 6 is concerned.

So marvel is superb in animation too!!!,"basically I will say that I like all marvels live action movies but actually I never expected it will prove itself in animation too.the film was awesome the action and techs were awesome especially ""microbots"" and I liked the whole team especially bay-max and the emotion between the Hamada brothers and between bay-max and Ciro were also awesome.I like live action movies only though I watched smurfs but after watching this movie I will watch the animated movies too.I thought marvel is awesome in live action but they proved themselves in animation through this movie. I heard that the sequel is announced and maybe it releasing in 2018 hail marvel................................",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Enjoyable but cliché,"Honestly, I loved big Hero 6. The characters were easy to love, the action was actually really fun to watch, and who can't love the marshmallow doctor/hero Baymax? However, this movie suffered from the usual clichés of modern movies and was very formulaic. We had our cliché cast of characters with a formulaic event set-up. Its extremely formulaic, but with a twist that I didn't see coming. The jokes in the movie are actually very well done. I found myself laughing several times throughout the movie. The characters, although quickly, are well-developed and even just by seeing what inventions they created you can tell what kinds of people they are. This is probably the best superhero movie I've seen recently. I've been very unimpressed with a lot of superhero movies lately, but this one takes the cake as the best one I've seen in the past year at least. Overall its a very enjoyable movie. If your looking to be critical, don't bother with it, but if you just want to watch something, then look no further than Big Hero 6.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Inspiring, gorgeous and fun","Walt Disney Pictures' latest animated feature Big Hero 6 is based on a Marvel comic – a first for the company. The titular team was created in 1998 and has only appeared in what amounts to a handful of comic book issues. This obscurity ends up working in Disney's favor as they were given the freedom to tweak and mold Big Hero 6 into something that is much more family friendly than your typical Marvel fare without being beholden to some nonsensical reverence to the comic's roots. Yes, there are lessons to be doled out here and positive messages abound, but Big Hero 6 is so much fun and its ""big message"" so earnest and culturally relevant that these life lessons actually strengthen the film rather than provoke unintentional eye rolls. Big Hero 6 stars Hiro (voiced by Ryan Potter) as a child science prodigy who, in the film's early scenes, is content using his abilities to hustle in the underground world of ""bot fighting,"" which is exactly what you imagine. Hiro's older brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney) pushes him to be more than just a back-alley robotics hustler and brings him to his school to hopefully persuade him into enrolling. It is there that we are introduced to Tadashi's classmates, all of which possess a very specific science-based skill: The cartoonishly meticulous laser expert Wasabi (Damon Wayans Jr.), adrenaline junkie and daredevil Go Go (Jamie Chung), bubbly chemistry expert Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez), and the lovable slacker known as Fred (T.J. Miller). We also get to meet Professor Callaghan (James Cromwell) and his ethically unsound adversary, Alistair Krei (Alan Tudyk). It's worth noting that all of this tablesetting and introduction of heroes and villains occurs in the university's aptly named Exposition Hall – one of many clever sight gags in a film loaded with them. It is also here that we're introduced to the real star of Big Hero 6, Baymax – an inflatable robot whose sole purpose is to provide medical care to people.Baymax (voiced by 30 Rock's Scott Adsit) provides the film with a majority of its comic relief. The puffy balloon design of the character is played for laughs often and the animators really let their imaginations run wild here. The film has a great understanding of physics and, as you might imagine, there are plenty of physically amusing things you can do with a balloon. Now picture that balloon having the ability to speak with the voice of a trained comedic actor because as great as those bits of physical humor are, the real charm of Baymax lies in Scott Adsit's vocal performance. He delivers his lines in a deadpan, matter-of-fact cadence that is both childlike and maternal in nature. It's an odd pairing of traits but it really works for such a unique character whose only desire is to heal, at all costs. With Baymax, we have the ultimate comedy presence on screen; he is both the foil and the straight man and that makes for a comedy act that never grows tiresome.Anyone looking for the depth of The Incredibles should keep searching because you won't find it here. The rest of the Big Hero 6 team can't really compete with Baymax's wit or charm but they really don't have to. This is an animated team that functions much better as a team (Baymax included) than as individuals. Not that they're boring, per se, but these characters are more or less types rather than fully fleshed out heroes like Pixar's aforementioned team. Fortunately, teamwork is one of Big Hero 6's messages and so it's likely that these specific, one dimensional supporting characters are meant to shine a light on the greater good of teamwork rather than that of the individual. Still, it's frustrating when you've seen other films champion the idea of teamwork while handling the supporting cast much better.The main message of Big Hero 6 is this: don't take the easy way just because you can. It urges its characters (and hopefully the audience) to solve problems by looking at them at another angle, to use your imagination and think creatively. This point is made no fewer than a half dozen times in the film and I couldn't stop myself from smiling at every occurrence. Maybe it's just my personal bias or maybe it's because I've never seen a film so eagerly invested in inspiring its kid- centric audience to actually think but I loved Big Hero 6 for this reason above all. The excitement of having a logical breakthrough is treated as being one of the greatest feelings one can have and I'd be lying if I said I disagree. This is a movie you can actually feel great about letting your kids watch approximately two million times before they become treacherous adolescents.Despite some glaring black holes in the plot and a montage set to the abysmal sounds of Fall Out Boy, Big Hero 6 is a whole lot of fun. It's got heart, humor, and action and looks absolutely beautiful. This is a stellar animated film that will not only keep your kids entertained, but possibly inspire them to do much more than sing ""Let It Go"" in a cacophonous shriek for the rest of their childhood.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Big Hero 6 is a movie that combine America Super Hero with Japanese Culture but that doesn't help it self from the repetitive and predictable plot""","Big Hero 6 is the newest animation movie from Disney who last year successfully with Frozen in Box office and Award and this year Disney tries to do the same with Big Hero 6.This movie is really interesting for sure with it's America Super Hero Element which you can say that it's really similar to Marvel (and Marvel is now own by Disney so....) and the movie combine that with Japanese element and makes it's interesting.And that's not a coincident at all because a lot of stuff in the movie is screaming this Culture fusion like the town is name ""SanfranTokyo"" or Kabuki mask that the bad guy in this movie use.The problem is even that culture fusion , it's doesn't help the movie from it's repetitive and predictable script which i think is really a problem of Superheroes movies now days and Big Hero 6 offers nothing new at all.Fortunately the animation part of Disney really help the movie from it's repetitive with it's stunning Visual Design , The movement of characters and that light-heart family theme from Disney which makes the movie enjoy to watch.Overall Big Hero 6 is another good animation movie from Disney but don't expect anything new because you will find nothing here.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Stop hating this movie!,"I know there are generally many bad movies out there but Big Hero 6 is not one of them. Yes I know we had some pretty forgettable movies from Disney in the past but nowadays they have been able to show so much more than too simplistic stories or even annoying endings where it ends in a pathetic way. But Big Hero 6 does not have any of those I do not understand all the hatred?Ignore the stupid fact about this is a kids movie, BH6 showed so much more than what the negativity wants you to believe in to. There are character development, a story that really focus to find its goal, good-spirited and likable characters, enjoyable soundtrack and of course it's heart.I refuse to agree that this is a horrible movie, it bloody isn't! If you want to talk about bad Disney movies then talk about Little Mermaid 2, Pocahontas 2, Cars 2 or Brave. This is Disney's most entertaining and their best movie since Wreck-It Ralph.

Big Hero 6,"One of the weaker entries in the Disney Universe, perhaps it is the fact that I find it harder to find connection with a piece of machinery. What really shines for me is the fictionized setting of San Francisco + Tokyo, but beyond that the film is a pretty bareboned Superhero film featuring a flush of characters that aren't exactly memorable. For me, these Disney films has to be solid emotionally, and I simply didn't feel this way in Big Hero 6. The film still has enough intrigue to interest children due to the design of Baymax and superhero theme, but it simply fails to move beyond that.",,Anonymous,Animation
Typical animation story yet somewhat distinctively enjoyable,"Here we have 'Big Hero 6', another fun-filled animation ride. Disney made huge profits with last year's musical Frozen. This time they have Marvel's superhero characters featuring. Like most animation films Big Hero 6 will appeal the kids a lot, still its refreshing enough for adults.The story is set in futuristic hybrid city of 'San Fransokyo'. 'Hiro' a teenager who is very bright with technology and robotic stuff but uses most of his talents in back-alley robot fights. His brother 'Tadashi' worried of Hiro's plans decides to take him to his university with robotics labs and futuristic gadgets. Tadashi shows Hiro 'Baymax' an inflated health care robot created by Tadashi. Hiro also meets Tadashi's friends each one good in a particular tech-field and also the head Prof. Callaghan who is impressed by Hiro's talents. Inspired by all this Hiro gets enthusiastic about joining the university. With help of his brother Hiro starts working on a project called 'Microbots' which are tiny programmable robots whose swarm can form any shape and can be controlled with his mind. He presents it at the university exhibition impressing everybody. But every new-tech stuff attracts villains wanting to misuse it and that's how the story follows. No spoilers.Apart from of few twists, the story is pretty much predictable. The relation between Baymax and Hiro is very endearing and is the strong-point of the film. The huge inflated hug able robot Baymax will be loved by kids and adults alike. Also the brotherly- bond between Hiro and Tadshi is nicely put forth. Well the typical robot tries to fit in human environment is used, still the cute interactions between Hiro and Baymax keep us engaged. The second half of the film is more of superhero-action like The Incredibles but it lacks the same humor and thrill. Towards the end it goes into the cliché revenge bandwagon and the ending could be easily seen coming. On the positive side, the animation is incredible like most animated-movies these days and is briskly paced. The music is also good for the superhero theme. Voice-cast does a nice job, Scott Adist's Baymax being the best without any doubt. I had never heard of these superhero characters before wacthing the film, as a origins story I think it does a good job.Overall, I feel the kids will like it a lot more than adults and will be wanting to have a Baymax of their own at the end. I too loved him a lot especially with all the iron-man like upgrades which Hiro gives him, which made him impressively cool besides being adorable already. Other characters apart from Hiro lacked a bit of focus yet were pretty much entertaining. In the end, Big Hero 6 falls slightly short of this years 'The Lego Movie' and 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' for best animated feature, but its just my personal opinion.RATING: [3/5]",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great adaptation!,"I didn't see this movie when it was first released back in December, I've read a few Big Hero 6 comic book issues, not a big fan. But the movie is really well done, you really care about the characters and their situations, the animation is superb, the story is really well constructed. The only ""problem"" with this movie is that it's the typical super hero origin story, there's really nothing new about it. However, this is not a problem since it's so well done. Without giving any spoilers, the movies gives us what Disney ALWAYS gives to the viewers, a tearjerker story. It's not as harsh as Bambi or the Lion King, but if you cry easily, get a lot of tissues along with the popcorn. Kids will love it as well as super hero fans. And there's some jokes here and there for the parents, they won't be bored with it. Big Hero 6 is a great time.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
The best animated movie that I see this year,"The movie is beautiful in a way that only Disney can do it. The main character is an wonderful kid, I love intelligent kids and this one has a background not so good to tell what makes his story more likable. His brother's robot is hilarious and so sweet, and his robots are completely amazing too! I cried many times during the movie. To me is an absolute must seen for animation movies fans. For kids movie will pass a good message about the will of want know and have great achievements, maybe a boost for interest on robots and science. Furthermore, the typical message about friends: with friends is easy pass by tough situations, they always help us and will be there for us. An important one.

The best movie since Guardians Of The Galaxy,"Big Hero 6 is a big shot through the heart (with a taste of Bon Jovi) to all of the other films of this year. Being one of the first major collaborations between Disney and Marvel, Big Hero 6 delivered one hell of a blast in the box office to become one of the best movies of this year. Keeping the lovable Disney style with the typical Marvel taste gave this movie a big jump in quality. It looked gorgeous, it felt smooth and savory, and I enjoyed every second of it.Mixing a beautiful visual quality with its glorious soundtrack, it felt like I was watching Guardians of the Galaxy. Having a great cast of characters who had their wonderful personalities and visible flaws (as all people do, this is personal flaws, not flaws in the actual characters), it felt like I was watching a mini Tony Stark trying to build his way to solve all of his problems. The movie was a perfect length, having a quick introduction into who everyone was (with no 20 minute backstory *jumps up and flails in excitement*), and then it got to the problem. It was on point and direct all the way through, just as well as having fun along the way.I only had one, very very VERY slight problem with this movie. It was how Hiro (the main character) didn't come across as to who the supposed villain was, even though he could build an army of neuro-transmitted microbots in a garage. And how quickly the scene seemed when he came up with the solution to fight the problem with his friends. Very very slight personal issues and nothing that reflected in on my review of this film.Big hero six is a clever, cute, funny, and VERY creative take on the modern day superhero film. The movie took itself to great heights and earn its spot among some of my favorite movies of all time. This was a movie made for anyone of any age, and that is a hard thing to pull off. Final note, stay until after the credits. (It's a Marvel movie.)Final Review Score: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"There was potential here, to make a really cool movie!","'BIG HERO 6': Three Stars (Out of Five)Walt Disney Animation Studio's first adaptation of a Marvel comic book is this 3D computer-animated film about a team of superheroes, led by a 14-year-old robotics genius and his inflatable robot sidekick. It was directed by Don Hall and Chris Williams and written by Robert L. Baird, Dan Gerson and Jordan Roberts (based on the comic book series created by Steven T. Seagle and Duncan Rouleau). It stars the voice talents of Ryan Potter, Scott Adsit, T. J. Miller, Génesis Rodríguez, Damon Wayans, Jr., Jamie Chung, James Cromwell, Maya Rudolph, Daniel Henney and Alan Tudyk. It's a huge hit at the Box Office and has gotten mostly positive reviews from critics and movie fans alike. As far as animated kids' movies go, I think it's a pretty good one but it's still too full of stupid kids' jokes.The story takes place in a futuristic city called San Fransokyo. Hiro (Potter) is a 14-year-old genius, who specializes in robotics and already graduated from high school. He spends most of his time, and wastes most of his talent, competing in illegal robot fights. His older brother, Tadashi (Henney), takes him to see the robotics lab at his university; in hopes it will inspire him to do something more with his skills. Hiro is especially impressed by an inflatable robot, designed to assist people with health issues (his brother created) called Baymax (Adsit). He meets the professor in charge of the school, Robert Callahan (Cromwell), and asks to join the school. Hiro then amazes everyone at a science exhibition, with his microbots project (tiny robots that combine together in multiple different forms) and is accepted to the university. Then his brother and Callahan are killed in a school fire and Hiro wants to get to the bottom of what happened, He teams up with Baymax, and his brother's friends, to do so. The five young scientists, and robot, become a superhero team.The film does feel a lot like an anime action movie and it's pretty different for a Disney film. It's great to see Walt Disney Pictures diversifying itself, and doing different things with their kids' films, but it's not different enough. While the action and visuals are cool it's still full of stupid jokes and is made to appeal mostly to grade-schoolers. It's too bad because there was potential here, to make a really cool movie, and I like the idea of Disney adapting obscure Marvel comic books (since they own the rights to them now). If they really want to make films that compare to the level that Pixar is putting out, they'll need to do a lot more though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/D17O2xOoOCw",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Baymax Deflate!,"Disney is clearly in a new renaissance with Wreck-It Ralph, Frozen, and now Big Hero 6. In fact, it's almost impossible to tell sometimes whether it's a Disney animation or Pixar film. And I was really impressed with Big Hero 6. I cant believe I waited almost a month to go out and see this one. It's not the best Disney animated film, or even the most creative. But it is entertaining from start to finish and a film that can be enjoyed by everyone of all ages.They introduce us to Hiro as a bot fighter who doesn't really have a home. Not literally, he lives with his brother and aunt. But he doesn't quite fit in with anybody and doesn't know how to put his talents to good work without getting into a little bit of trouble. Even though it was by the numbers Disney, I really liked his character arc. That's one of the many things that impressed me with Big Hero 6, it's not that different from any film we have seen, especially Disney, yet it brought so much joy and entertainment to the screen. But let's face it, the best part of the movie was Baymax. Last year Olaf and now Baymax. Talk about memorable characters and flat out hilarious physical comedy. Much like Olaf, his physical appearance brings a smile and chuckle to every motion (or attempt at motion) he gives us.There's one particular scene which Baymax attempts to squeeze through a window and my sisters and I were unable to control ourselves it was so hilarious. I missed at least a minute of dialog because I had to literally wipe the tears from my face and recover from the last minute of laughing out loud. The rest of the team served heir purpose. I cant say that all of their jokes hit or even found them memorable. In fact I'm not sure I remember their names, but they still helped create a fun universe for us to enjoy for (hopefully) years to come. The film does get pretty dark at times and even borders a kids movie at times but I really cant complain with the results. I had a lot of fun at the theater and I can say it was well worth the ticket price.+Baymax+Hysterical+Set's up a universe+For all ages-By the numbers-Supporting characters need improvements8.6/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

I feel as if the creators were just trying to get it to be dramatic, then got bored with it and said lets move on to the next project. I was extremely disappointed with what I expected to be a fun, cute and well-thought through kids' action story and am appalled that this movie got an Oscar on account of its blatant absence of depth. There were many parts where I rolled my eyes because of the overused script. The big moments were not explained and left the watcher unsatisfied.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
Big Hero 6 was a very awesome Disney animated experience!,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend who had seen this twice before and liked it very much. So did I after viewing this-what an awesome display of a bunch of science nerds becoming superheros after some tragic occurrences that happen early on. Baymax, a rubber robot, is also on hand to help his human counterparts to set things right. I didn't watch this in 3-D so when certain scenes came on, I winced a little in not being able to do so. Still, this was such a great mix of humor and action and had very likable characters, I mostly didn't care, one way or another! I mean, this was quite an awesome experience, I was simply just glad for the ride! So on that note, Big Hero 6 is highly recommended. Oh, and don't miss the after-ending credits sequence, it's a great hoot!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A bit familiar at times, but It's one of this year's best animated films","It dawned on me at the end of ""Big Hero 6"" that if we never get that sequel to ""The Incredibles"", a sequel to this film might satisfy me just fine. I thought it was very energetic, with some solid moments of heart and of humor, and some exciting action thrown in to boot. What's there not to love? It's the story of a young robotics genius named Hiro Hamada (voiced by Ryan Potter) who adopts his big brother's personal health care robot prototype, Baymax (Scott Adsit) and forms a superhero team with some of his fellow inventor/students to combat a masked super villain.What I liked best about this movie were the characters and they dynamics between them. Baymax, so lovable and cuddly with that big squishy body and that calm temperament even in stressful situations was a riot and I genuinely grew to love him... Woops, there I go calling the robot a him. It's really just a defibrillator and a medical encyclopedia on legs, but I felt closely attached to the robot. What does that tell you about the movie when the mechanical device without a real personality becomes someone you would like to call your friend? Don't take that the wrong way though, I thought all of the characters were well fleshed out, and most importantly, intelligent and proactive. Hiro isn't given superpowers, he decides that he wants to become a hero and combat the threat in San Fransokyo. What does he do? He uses his brain to give himself gadgets and the tools he needs. He's a kid, but one that's as brilliant and inventive as the audience members. I felt the same about the other characters, even the goofy comic-book and kaiju enthusiast Fred (T.J. Miller). They're like real people because they had strengths and weaknesses and I felt like I got to know them as the movie went along. I was really happy to see that the female characters were tough all the way through. They didn't turn into damsels in distress when the action got going. I felt like this was a superhero movie with some ideas and it celebrated invention and creative thinking, that the characters learned from their mistakes and were able to think on their feet and improve instead of just being handed solutions out of thin air.It's no surprise that the movie looks terrific, but it's worth mentioning that there are a lot of cool flying sequences and scenes where debris and stuff is flying at the camera and that in 3-D, it's pretty sweet. It's not in-your-face, but I was pretty impressed with it. There are some good action bits in this movie, particularly noteworthy is a long and very exciting car chase with our heroes driving with Baymax as they are being chased by the big bad in this movie. Speaking of which, without telling you too much about this villain, I really liked this guy's powers. When you've got six people going against a single guy, you have got to do some creative writing and planning to have the characters actually challenged and they did a good job here. The unique way they have this villain go about his bad guy ways really impressed me. I was excited any time he came on-screen, and not only because I was genuinely intrigued as to who (or maybe even what) was behind that kabuki mask.If you're wondering if the best bits of comedy have been spoiled in the trailers, I would say... kind of. There are still some very funny moments, but if you haven't seen any trailers I would say just skip them and go straight into the movie blind to get the maximum amount of laughs. While you're there, make sure you stick around until the very end of the credits because there is a great little segment there you don't want to miss. Don't come in late either because while some of the best moments might have been spoiled for you with the clips on TV, you might not even be aware of the wonderful short ""Feast"" that is presented before the main feature. I thought it was absolutely wonderful. Why can't we get more of those before not just animated films, but every movie? I haven't really been blown away by any children's movies this year, not since ""The Lego Movie"" and way after that with ""How to Train Your Dragon 2"". I have to say ""Big Hero 6"" didn't have me screaming for joy once it was over, but I really enjoyed myself. It's solid family entertainment and if you're an adult, you can go watch it by yourself and you won't feel ashamed at all! I am still a little lukewarm about it overall, but you know what? That's me, and I feel like maybe I was just off that day or something because I can't think of anything I didn't like about the movie. I'd be happy to check it out one more time to see how I feel about it and I think that says a lot. I fully endorse you to check out ""Big Hero 6"". It's fun, it's colorful, it's funny, it's got some action and I was really touched at some of the more dramatic bits. It's not just for kids; adult can thoroughly enjoy this one too. I'm still laughing at some of the better gags. (3-D theatrical version on the big screen, December 9, 2014)",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Geeky Randy's summary,"Inspired by the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name, this cute 2014 American 3D computer-animated superhero action comedy produced by Disney follows a robotics genius named Hiro (Potter), who forms a superhero team to help stop his invention from being used for harm by pioneer entrepreneur Alistair Krei (Tudyk). Baymax (Adsit), the white inflatable robot, is the movie's ""poster bot"" and for good reason—but let's not forget Mochi (Hiro's affectionate fat cat), who comes in second place for stealing the show. Wonderful animation, but the overwhelming praise seems a little undeserved considering the story's predictable turns—the Fall Out Boy song ""Immortals"" is also a huge misstep.*** (out of four)",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
I am satisfied with my care,"This is not the comic book I remembered.Then again, I barely remembered the comic book at all. Goes to show how ""critically acclaimed"" it was. In typical Disney tradition, Disney studios took the title of an existing piece of work, and changed the heck out of it.what was originally a government sanctioned team of of super powered black ops operatives is now a bunch of genius teens named after food. Each character is recognisable modern high school stereotype: Wasabi goes from a chef with qi energy blades to the tough talking genius jock, Fred is the drawling slacker with a monster ""Fred-zilla"" suit, no longer the psychic who manifests a giant monster construct. Honey-Lemon keeps her power purse but goes from sexy-dressed secret agent to excitable genki girl-with-glasses. Gogo-Tamago loses her ex-convict background and power to turn into a high speed energy egg (hence the ""tamago"" name) and becomes your typical tough but quiet girl who is secretly loves an adrenaline rush (which she gets from her electromagnetic skating suit).The biggest change is Hiro and Baymax, our main characters. Young Hiro Yamada finally finds his place among fellow tech-obsessed teens at his brother's university. With the help of his new found friends, he creates ""microbots"" which can form into any shape and are controlled by thought via a transmitter. A disaster robs Hiro of his invention and his beloved brother. Grieving the loss of Tadashi, Hiro accidentally activates Tadashi's project ""Baymax"", an inflatable health care robot who approaches Hiro as his patient. Hiro and Baymax form an awkward buddy relationship until news surfaces of a masked villain who appears to be using Hiro's microbots for crimes. Sensing that this masked man may be linked to his brother's death, Hiro sets out to investigate and take him down, with Baymax in tow whether he likes it or not.Ah Baymax.......Disney's latest stroke of merchandising genius. Kids love their adorable non- human sidekicks. Olaf the snowman in FROZEN, Pascal and Maximus from TANGLED. And now Baymax, who gets stripped of his gritty comic book origin as a shape shifting robotic hulk with the brain of Hiro's dead father, who can transform into a monstrous demon form and kick butt. In the movie, he gets turned into an inflatable, huggable, balloon-bot with a simple programme to provide the best form of physical and emotional healthcare for his patient, even if he has little knowledge of human emotions outside of theory and data. His adorable look and innocent personality will be a big hit with kids. Children everywhere will be clamouring for Baymax balloons, Baymax floats, inflatable life sized ""hug-me"" Baymax, and if technology allows, an intractable ""talk-to-me"" Baymax toy.Now putting adult cynicism aside, BIG HERO 6 does tackle some interestingly mature themes for kids' show. It is no doubt a tried and true superhero origin story fuelled by the death of a loved one. We've seen it in Spiderman, Batman, many times. The whole ""boy and his robot, forming a bond of family, and learning the value of human life"" thing was done with much more finesse and impact in James Cameron's TERMINATOR 2. But dig deeper into the narrative and even adults will find much to love about this movie.We have have the theme of how one deals with loss, with various characters being put through the five stages of grief yet acting on those emotions differently based on one's values. On top of that, BIG HERO 6 deals with wish fulfillment of any kid's desire for the perfect friend. Baymax portrays love and care in its most simplest and innocent of forms.Hiro on the other hand portrays a harsh world's tendency to force those closest to them into roles they were never meant for. His developmental journey with Baymax, from the awkward attempts at learning a secret handshake to the Baymax's straight faced earnest calm when faced with the gravest of situations, is a heartwarming and at times heart wrenching one as a boy and his robot forms an unbreakable brotherly bond. Love in its simplest form. Unconditional love that any child, past or present, secretly desires.Digital artists and CGI aficionados too will desire BIG HERO 6's impressive computer generated imagery. Starting with the fictional city of San Fransokyo, the level of detail is astounding and almost photo-realistic. Leaves flutter in the wind, strands of hair react to movement. Although the character designs retain the simpler streamlined, big headed, style used in previous Disney CGI movie, the amount of care that went into crafting each model and animating it with the right sense of mass shows an amazing level of expertise in the field.Bottom line is, BIG HERO 6 is good. It is colourful, action packed and simple enough for kids and inner children. Yet it packs a significant emotional wallop and some mature themes for those willing to dig deeper into the narrative. Visually, it is a fine piece of work to look at and just take in the details in the wonderful animation. Accompanied by a rousing electronic score by WRECK- IT RALPH'S Henry Jackman, BIG HERO 6 looks set to obscure its own middling comic book source material, (which is not entirely surprising since there was hardly any reprint of the comic aside from the hard-to-get single issues). Big on thrills, big on heart, big on technical achievement; that is BIG HERO 6. Oh and big bucks for Disney's merchandising department.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
We All Need Another Hero,"This film is mildly recommended. ☆☆ ½Disney and Marvel have joined forces to beget Big Hero 6, a computer animated film about a boy and his pet robot. They have created wondrous worlds and interesting enough characters only to place them in the most mundane plot. The film starts off promisingly with plenty of awe and joy but finally dissipate into one action chase sequence after the next. Now this may sell toys and merchandise at a hefty profit but the cost of their own creative ingenuity and soul is the price paid.Most animated features nowadays feed into the video game frenzy with its loud aggressive action and pop spectacle sacrificing fully developed characters and the remains of a plot for large screen destruction. Big Hero 6 is once again that type of film showcase. As in the past, just like other well-crafted predecessors (Wall-e, Brave, Frozen, Cars, and Planes, for example), this film is wildly (and unevenly) entertaining before it falls victim to this malady. (Some animated films like Ratatouille, Up, The Incredibles, and the Toy Story franchise have successfully sidestepped these pitfalls with stronger and more cohesive scripts with a satirical bent.)In Big Hero 6, we are somewhere in the future, in SanFransokyo to be more precise, a mash-up of both metropolises. Living there is our main human character, a teenage gamer and bot fighter named Hiro. Hiro is an intelligent but aimless computer geek, unlike his big brother Tadashi who is a robotic whiz and has created a cutting edge robot named Baymax. After tragedy befalls Hiro, he is forced to join forces with Tadashi's lab mates and battle an evil mastermind. (Parents, be forewarned that on a scale from 1 to 10, the emotionally scarring damage of this sad event to your child psyche could fall midway between Bambi's mother's demise as 1 and the traumatic killing of Old Yeller as a 10.)The moviegoer is taken on a diverting journey, but it's one that never lives up to its clever beginnings. Big Hero 6 doesn't achieve its true potential when the end nears. It wears itself out with too many well-staged but dramatically inert chase scenes. The results are predictable and so formulaic. The film reads like a rejected X-Men comic, far too simplistic in structure and pacing.Literally, the heart of the film is the lovable and huggable Baymax, the most distinctive character in the entire film. The animators have done wonderful things with him, from his sluggish movements, sound design and his rubbery latex exoskeleton. All of the others in the film pale by comparison. In fact, the characters, as drawn, lack any real presence. However, kudos go out to the detailed and creative background designs of San Fransokyo which show a lot more imagination than this woebegone script. (Surprisingly, six writers are credited with this lame story and its semi-plot that is more concerned with action than characters.)Big Hero 6 is strictly a heroes vs. villain by-the-comic-book affair. It could have been so much more rewarding if it would have just focused on the relationship between Hiro and Baymax and their bonding instead of veering uncontrollably off-course for the sake of action. As it is, the film is still visually strong and has some charming humorous moments, mostly due to our walking marshmallow of a hero's fish-out-of-water existence. However, Baymax will make a nice expensive toy for parents to buy this Christmas...a win-win strategy for Disney/Marvel, but a win-lose situation for the more sophisticated lovers of film animation.

The Kind of Humour We've all been Waiting for,"The movie Big Hero 6 is a sweet film that packs lots of humour and some quick life lessons in less than two hours. The quirky humour from Baymax's cumbersome body never ceases to make people laugh, that being the core of the film itself. Even though the plot was quite predictable, it is a good film that you can just relax to and enjoy without having to think too much.It, being the quirky-ness of Baymax, made the character extremely relatable as we have all had moments like he has. For instance, when he squeezes by the bed and knocks over some of the books or when he is so easily distracted from what he was doing and goes to try to watch the TV with Hiro's mother. Another scene being when Baymax turns himself into a portable heating unit that everyone then lies against.The humour is quick and simple as to keep its audience entertained and amused as most comedians do whilst doing stand-up. For instance, take the scene where Hiro discovers that Baymax is in his room. First Baymax, being a robot that is designed to be ""your personal health-care companion"", inflates and his sheer size automatically becomes a handicap, as he isn't able to get to Hiro because there is a tight space between the bed and the table. Right after, Baymax is assessing Hiro having barely hurt himself just because he said the word ""Ow!"" Hiro falls backwards as Baymax tries to help him but then ends up having a shelf-worth of figurines fall onto him making him repeat the word ""Ow!"" a couple of times and Baymax responding each time with the same interrupted sentence ""On a scale of one to ""Along with the ""Captain Obvious"" humour that is randomly thrown into the movie by the other characters. Especially in the case of Fred, the wannabe hero, who appears to be a young infant in an adult's body.This movie was a great catch, because it took a normal kid's everyday life and threw in a couple of accidents and funny situations, which happens to everyone on a regular basis. What makes it funny is we are literally on the other side watching it happen to someone else and not ourselves.However, with all this humour there was still some space to subtly squeeze in, as Baymax so skillfully showed us, a couple of life lessons. In regards to whether it is worth your time going for higher studies, as well as not accidentally putting your own interest before others'.Overall, fun movie to watch with the family and have a good laugh all together.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Really Good!!,"I absolutely loved this movie! It had cute adorable scenes and it had sad scenes, as well as some action scenes. The animation was beautiful and the concept of the whole movie was interesting and different. I can honestly say that this is my new favorite Disney movie. Frozen? Who needs Frozen when we now have Big Hero 6! This movie was really just the epitome of perfection and it is so perfect that you could watch it with your family! This movie overall made me smile and keep that smile for the rest of the day. A movie definitely worth watching even if you're an adult or you don't particularly like watching animation. This movie will warm your heart and make you want to be a hero all over again.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Some decent superhero junk food,"""Big Hero 6"" is kind of a misnomer as the movie really focuses on two team members and relegates the other 4 to set dressing. Know that going in and you'll be fine. For me, the heart of the story lay in the relationship between Hiro and Baymax (mostly because they pumped the big white airbag so full of charm and personality, he's a great character). But that's where the movie started to feel a lot like ""How To Train Your Dragon"", and not just because the hero is perched on the big guy's back. Hiro/Baymax, Hiccup/Toothless; the 4 remaining superhero team, the viking background players. It's not a deal-breaker, I guess, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't nagging. For all I know, it was like this in the original comic. But either way, I hope they give some thought to the other four in the next movie and make them actual characters.This is a pretty movie, to be sure. They did a great job with San Fransokyo. But between the undercooked characters and the lame villain (easily pegged from the beginning), there's plenty of room for improvement.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Oscar Worthy,"I know for a fact that it will be nominated for Best Animation at the 2015 Oscars, no doubt. After the princess high I am sure everyone was on after Frozen, it was nice to see a Disney film with a male lead and about hi tech/engineering (Obviously not the first, I just enjoyed seeing this). This film had action, enough emotion to make you want to cry, and some seriously funny lines that had most of the adults in the audience laughing. Disney has really found it's way of really being for all ages, I went with my boyfriend and there was just as many older couples as families. This movie was not just a film to entertain, it was a push for kids to create, Who didn't want to build their own Baymax after watching this?!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Baymax: ""Hello, I am Baymax"".","Baymax has to be the most adorable and coolest Disney character I've seen in a while.The story is about San Fransokyo being under attack - but robotics expert Hiro Hamada, with his robot Baymax, will team up with some reluctant, novice crime fighters in order to save the city.Just like every year Disney always brings out films that are mostly good or adorable, and a long comes Big Hero 6 and this movie is on the level of adorable, but not that close to brilliant.The animation in this movie was so colorful and so gorgeous to look at that my eyes couldn't get enough of it. The character's were funny and pretty awesome, even Baymax which has to be the most adorable and the most lovable character I've seen on the big screen. The action scenes were really well shot and enjoyable to watch.The ending to this movie dragged a little bit for me. If they ended the movie about a couple minutes ago I could have given it a bigger rating, but the ending kept going and felt like it went on and on.Big Hero 6 is a entertaining movie with beautiful animation and a solid story line.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Good Film for Children and Adults, But a Little Predictable","There was a lot of hype for this film and it took me awhile but I finally sat down to watch it with my six year old sister. She loved it. She laughed, she paid attention (something she has trouble doing) and that was good enough for me. However, as a 20 year old I have a problem with the film. It was good, I'll first start by saying that, however it was predictable. I could literally see every twist and turn from a mile away. For those of you who have not seen it I will not go into detail as to be sure I do not spoil it for you. The plot was about 20% originality 80% recycled from other films. Maybe Im exaggerating a tiny bit but thats about how I felt. The character development was great, it had a fantastic cast, and if I had to watch it again I think I would. But don't go into it thinking this film will be a groundbreaking piece of cinema, it simply is not. Its fun to watch but nothing too special.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Despite all the action and flair, Big Hero 6 is centered on friendship. It's easily enjoyable as anyone will find something to relate and be thoroughly delighted.","Big Hero 6 is a witty and hilarious superhero flick without the recent trend of nasty grittiness. Visually engaging, the movie is easily accessible and will entertain general audience. Its many heartfelt moments as well as genuine comedy elevate the movie into the caliber of Disney's greats. The plot moves fast as it shows a lighter take on superhero formula, it never presses too much or heavy handed on its approach. While Disney is always known to showcase visual in fantasy setting, it's nice to see the vista changes to modern city of San Fransokyo, as the name suggests, an oriental version of San Fransisco.For those who have been exposed to horde of superhero movies of recent time, it's easy to see how the plot moves, especially as an origin story. Big Hero 6 makes the expected journey fun with plenty of humor, mostly fat jokes in expense of Baymax, the inflatable marshmallow robot. Viewer might predict the story, but still amused nonetheless. The assembly of the team deserves a credit for introducing many characters, presentable enough to be memorable but still delicately manages to produce a sense of camaraderie. Unlike many superheroes who have the luxury of a full movie or series, these guys must share the spotlight, yet they're all feel pretty welcomed in their own quirky ways.Graphic-wise the animation is great. While there are other mediums with more realistic visual, the movie delivers action in just the right balanced tone of fantasy and modern contemporer. It's definitely vibrant with colors, design is impeccable, and the movement looks comically organic. Disney has reached the point where it can dazzle with 3D the same as it did decades ago with hand drawn picture and still moves audience with heartfelt story.Despite all the action and flair, Big Hero 6 is centered on friendship. It's easily enjoyable as anyone will find something to relate and be thoroughly delighted.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A very entertaining film that doesn't try to do anything particularly new,"Big Hero 6 is fun. Big Hero 6 is entertaining. Big Hero 6 is emotional. Big Hero 6 is straight-forward.I went into this movie with no expectations at all because I didn't watch any of the trailers for it except for the first teaser. The movie is very beautiful. It has lots of impressive lighting techniques and has excellent textures at certain times. Overall, the movie looks fantastic. It is nearly on par with this year's How to Train Your Dragon 2.But animation isn't the most important element. The plot itself is what is most important and is probably the biggest issue with the movie. The movie feels like... a cartoon... like a Saturday morning cartoon. You know exactly where the plot is going and certain lines of exposition are almost unbearable to hear. The movie doesn't throw any twists or turns into the formula except for possibly one scene during the beginning. Even worse, the movie takes direct shots from the Iron Man flight sequence AND from How To Train Your Dragon/Avatar. The whole ""bonding flight experience"" is done in this movie and while it looks nice, it is pretty much a formula by now. However, there is more to a movie than originality.The dialogue is probably one of the stronger aspects of the movie. While it isn't hilarious or Oscar worthy dialogue, it is spoken very well. The voice-actors did a terrific job of getting into their characters. The characters themselves are well written, but the side-characters (you know... there are 6 heroes...) don't really effect the plot that much. It is strange just how little the side- characters actually effect the plot. They are there... and do stuff... but they don't really change the outcome of the plot. There were much less contrived ways of doing what they did.Long story short: Big Hero 6 is a fun and entertaining movie. The first half of the movie had me hooked, but the second half is pretty much a formula. The funny thing about this movie is that I found it much more interesting BEFORE the villain actually showed up. Yeah, getting to learn about the character's and their everyday struggles was much more original than the villain's arc.Definitely worth seeing since it does have a rich atmosphere that is worth the price of a ticket alone.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"your average ""teenage hero finds his place in society"" movie","Enjoyable but without any surprises.The character designs are the wide eyed Disney CGI designs seen in Frozen, Tangled etc. . The setting itself is a futuristic .. well, lets say utopian city (not sure if it may not be dystopian, but i think it leans more to the utopian side).The story follows your stereotypical arc. Unwilling kid becomes hero, finds his place in society and a team, beats bad guy.The bad guy is a bad guy with a twist - a twist that is sadly never really explored much (probably because it is primarily a kids movie and i daresay a kid of the target age range is unlikely to complain about such things) The good guys is your typical ""nerdy"" gang of people that are of course brilliant, rich and deeply caring for each other (especially the protagonist whom they seem to care for a lot more than i would have expected from the brief time they actually got to know each other) The bad guy is someone unsurprising that is shown a ""kind of motivation"" for his actions - but the justification of the extend of his actions is hardly justified ... at all.However - even if the story seemed to have more problems than i d like to see in such a simple setup - the pacing and humor is well placed.It may sound a little harsh - but all in all - the movie was kind of forgettable. A time well spent ( not boring ) but 10 minutes afterwards - the rather bland characters popped out of my mind.The only thing that actually stayed was the idea of Japan and American culture (the good parts of it) merged together to become something quite exotic and amazing.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
A non-stop joyride.,"Sure to be the mega-hit of the holidays, Disney's futuristic tale ticks all of the right boxes: it's funny, smart, charming and exhilarating. Set in San Fransokyo – a clever amalgamation of American and Oriental style – we follow mourning teen-genius Hiro (Ryan Potter) as he bonds with his late brother's friends and scientific creation, Baymax. With an irresistibly huggable design, amusing voice (thanks to Scott Adsit) and delightful demeanour, Baymax provides the lion's share of laughs and, ultimately, is the star of the show. Not as memorable as the cuddly, inflatable robot, the humans are a mixed bag. Whilst lead protagonist Hiro and his brother Tadashi (the sort of older sibling we all want, voiced by Daniel Henney) are likable and fleshed out, their ragtag group of mates are cardboard cut-outs and the pair of scientists vying for Hiro's invention (awesomely conceived micro-bots) are clichéd and one-dimensional. But underdeveloped supporting players and it's somewhat generic ending are minor gripes, as Big Hero 6 segues from electrifying action sequences to hilarious comedic set-pieces, via the occasional touching moments, with absolute ease, resulting in a non-stop joyride. A wonderful Christmas treat from the Mouse House that'll be a smash with young'uns and, possibly even more, with their parents.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Jolting Experience of Modern Fun,"The way I viewed ""Big Hero 6"" is that it's the answer to all of the little boys who may have enjoyed ""Frozen"" but didn't couple themselves to it as passionately as maybe the females in their age group. What ""Frozen"" was to young girls is what ""Big Hero 6"" is to young boys, except it is not as deftly written as the former was.The writing is clever even if the dialogue feels hammy and as artificial as they could have made it. The screenplay solidly emphasizes the vitality of intellect in the life of a teenager, as well as a theme of technology's growing power and capabilities. ""Big Hero 6"" most aptly expresses to younger males a sensitivity than can exist within the gender and does it in a way that is not extreme but a relatively understandable level.The bright visuals and speeding energy awaken the picture. It's a jolting experience of modern fun. Kids will have a blast and laugh until their stomaches hurt. Baymax is the selling point of ""Big Hero 6"" and he doesn't disappoint as a children's story character: he's like the epitome of a light-hearted, honest, articulate, tubby, inflatable hug. It has compassion and action, an irresistible pair of traits in a children's movie.* * * / * * * *Grade: B+",,Anonymous,Animation
Seriously?,"Okay, let me start off by saying don't listen to all of the naysayers. Big Hero 6 is an amazing film from WDAS, and surely is better than the dreadful frozen. Not only does it have a captivating story, but it shows realistic reactions to grief, loss, and depression. Generally films that we watch from Disney have that level of realistic emotions, even more so with films like the lion king and mulan, but with Big Hero 6 we have something that is reminiscent of this time period, so we can connect better to the characters being portrayed. Other than that, it really would be nice to hear people singing centuries rather than let it go.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Watchable but just didn't seem all that special,"Watching this movie felt like a walk through memory lane when it comes to childhood Saturday morning cartoon written all over it. Except with a way bigger budget and cool CGI animation. I got to admit what first got my attention, is the fact that this is the first Disney animation based on a Marvel. The message of this movie I guess can work for some and not for others in my opinion. Maybe audiences that has gone through vengeful hatred could either agree or disagree with the main message of this movie. I noticed that there was slight elementent of Japanese anime in this movie as well. Which can work for some and not really for others who want to see a straight Disney style animation. What is lacking however is that I couldn't really get attached to the characters or the story. Mainly because of the generic and cliché direction of it all.

Excellent Disney Production Based on a Marvel Character,"In San Fransokyo, the fourteen year-old Hiro Hamada is a little genius that makes money in illegal robots fight. His older boy, the college student Tadashi, saves Hiro from a dangerous gang and brings him to his laboratory in the university to convince him to forget the fights. Tadashi shows his nurse robot Baymax that he is developing to Hiro and introduces his little brother to his friends Go Go Tomago, Wasabi, Honey Lemon and Fred. When Hiro meets his idol Professor Robert Callaghan, he decides to join the university. Hiro needs to invent something to attract the attention of Callaghan and he brings tiny robots called microbots that are useful for many applications to the science fair in the university. The entrepreneur Alastair Krei wants to buy the microbots but Hiro prefers to stay with Callaghan in the university. When Hiro and Tadashi leave the fair, there is a fire and Tadashi returns to the place to rescue Callaghan. However the building blows up and Tadashi dies. Later, Hiro activates Baymax and the robot follows the direction pointed out by the last microbot kept with Hiro. The boy chases Baymax and they come to an abandoned building. Hiro discovers that someone is producing microbots and they are attacked by a masked man the controls the microbots. They succeed to flee and Hiro decides to include armor and another chip in Baymax to make him a master in fights. They track the masked man down to the harbor but Go Go Tomago, Wasabi, Honey Lemon and Fred arrive summoned by Baymax. The masked man attacks the group and they team-up forming the Big Hero 6, using armors and their skills, to capture the masked man that they believe is Alastair Krei. But they have a huge surprise.""Big Hero 6"" is an excellent Disney production based on a Marvel character. The story is full of action and the characters are charismatic. The plot is not for children and combines violence with moral values. The beginning, with Hiro with a harmless robot in the fight arena, is hilarious.

"Light, fluffy, and enjoyable.  The movie was good too.","The Sierra Nevada Movie Club members don't tend to show up in large numbers for horror movies or animated films. However I had heard buzz about Big Hero 6 in regards to being nominated for best animated picture and I am one of those weirdos that enjoys seeing all the nominated films before the Oscars. Also the movie had been out awhile and this further kept some of our movie going numbers down. Four of our group came out for this one on our usual Tuesday night movie meet up.I went into the theater with mixed expectations. The previews had not won be over but as I said, I had heard good things about it. Also just because a movie has been deemed ""good"" doesn't mean that I will enjoy it. I was under the impression that the humor and story would be a bit too childish for my sensibilities. However, I was mistaken. It may have been the influence of the rum in my big gulp size cup, but I felt although the humor, characters, and plot would appeal more to children and was too geared toward adults, it was, nonetheless, a film with universal appeal, nether too simplistic nor too complicated. It was sweet without being sappy. It was emotional without being heavy handed. It was formulaic only to the extent that it may be one of those instances that the sequel may be better than the original. The original has to introduce you to the ""team"", where hopefully the sequel can build off of the personalities we have been introduced to and give us a full formed adventure. The team of course being the Big Hero 6: Baymax- the squishy robot programmed for health care, Hiro Hamada- the main protagonist of the film and robotics genius, Go Go Tomago- the tomboyish tough girl that gets around via wheels attached to her feet, Wasabi- the intimidating looking Rasta locked martial artist that gets spooked easily, Honey Lemon- the upbeat alchemist, and Fred- the sign twirling fan boy in a lizard suit.The film takes great liberties with the comic changing characters, locations, and the general look. It is not one of the best recent films to come from Disney animation, but it is good and compared to some of the other properties, lends itself well toward sequels.

This movie had a major influence on my recent life.,"And for all of its flaws, that is a significant accomplishment. On top of that, the movie is directed by Don Hall, who happens to have co-directed Winnie the Pooh (2011), one of my favourite kid's films. And the music comes from Henry Jackman, who also composed the music for that same. So I'd think we're in good hands.Like most Marvel comics and movies, Big Hero 6 is defined by tragedy in the protagonist's life (namely, Hiro losing his brother), which leads through a series of events which creates the team of crime-fighters. Admittedly, the team itself is not really the main focus: it's really mostly Baymax and Hiro. Baymax, being the main attraction, is highly suited to his built purpose, and of course, is pretty darn adorable. Hiro's pretty awesome too. We do get a handful of scenes with his brother Tadashi too, and he seems like a nice guy. So much so, that the scenes with Hiro trying to cope with his death really got to me. I mean... REALLY. In fact I'm still pretty bummed that Tadashi had to die the way he did.I cared about these people. Immensely. I wanted them to succeed, and that's the important part of any movie, even a Disney one. This caring forms sequences that may be TOO intense for some young children, like Wall-E, one of the only films that made me cry, and at the same time I hailed as one of Pixar's finest.The film certainly does not fail in the visual department, either. As the name ""San Fransokyo"" might imply, it's a futuristic amalgamation of both Eastern and Western cultures, and it is certainly a sight to behold. It takes a vision of the future we've seen before and makes it look fresh and innovative, to say the least. The attention to detail is astounding, in fact it might need repeated viewings just to take it all in! Which, of course, might prove somewhat distracting from the story. The story might not be much of a surprise to you, but then, with these origin stories, what is surprising?In short: Big Hero 6 is worthy of its Oscar. Just about. I'm just a bit saddened that most reviews on IMDb don't share my sentiment on that. And I'm also annoyed that they delayed the film in UK cinemas just to put together a cameo of two British YouTubers! Come on guys, stop wasting time and give us our masterpiece!!! You know it's a masterpiece just as well as I do!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"We could be Hiro's, just for one day.","Another film watched essentially as it was the next suitable film on Disney Plus, rather than any inbuilt desire to actually watch it. I had actually seen ""Big Hero Six"" when it came out at the cinema, and enjoyed it enough, but it wasn't one that had dragged me back since. I do plan to try the ""Baymax"" shorts soon though, so it was a nice primer for those.When his brother, a student at the science and technology institute in San Frantokyo, is killed, Hiro (Ryan Potter) a genius roboticist in his own right, transforms Tadashi's (Daniel Henney) final project - an inflatable medical robot named Baymax (Scott Adsit) - into a power mech warrior, to track down the man he thinks is responsible. Together with some of Tadashi's colleagues, Hiro quickly discovers that super heroism is more dangerous than he anticipated, and that revenge is more seductive than he would have believed.So, I think that ""Big Hero Six"" is a reasonably enjoyable, if perhaps somewhat slight time. It has to do all the origin story stuff that a potentially starting superhero series has to do and, as with some of those film, the actual story of this one suffers a bit in retrospect. There are, perhaps some story beats that you might have anticipated missing because of this, for example, the rest of Tadashi's friends all seem to just agree to become a superhero team without any pause or debate as to whether this is a good idea. Particularly as that comes after they've already learned how dangerous the villain in this one is. I very much like that it presents an obvious upcoming twist as to who the villain is, only to call it themselves pretty early in proceedings. Admittedly, that does only leave one other potential person it might be.The film looks really good, Disney's Pixar emulating team, rather than Pixar themselves do a great job. And the vocal performances are really good, unfortunately the pick amongst them is the subsequently disgraced TJ Miller but that's not criticism you can level against this film.Despite being such a success, no follow up film every came to this, though, as mentioned, there are a couple of series to try. I do feel that this was a like, rather than a love though.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the best films I have seen,"Great, amazing, excellent. I feel lucky that I got my daughter to watch this film and I have equally enjoyed it. One of the best of Disney's. The story kept the interest during the whole film. Laugh, emotion, action, message, friendship, family, inspiration had it all. Fully recommended to parents with children but anyone will enjoy it. Really worth it.What touched me the most was the message tried to pass on of getting of the chair and fight for a purpose. Firstly the effort of the older brother, to help his brother stop wasting his bright mind and get him to the university. Then Hiro himself tries to fight the loss of his brother with the help of the robot and the other friends.Scored it 10 without thinking. One of the best films I have seen, among all categories, not only the cartoons one.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good enough,"Hiro is a child protégée who is interest in robotics. But after his brother's death in a fire, where his microbots are also destroyed, the only thing left from him was his medical robot. I watched this movie only because of the soundtrack, but I ended up quite enjoying it. It has some twists and surprises here and there, but nothing that you can't easily figure out, and so the story is quite predictable, but it is also funny and entertaining. But mostly it is funny. I also liked Stan Lee ""appearing"" in the end, so that was a nice treat. Like I said, the soundtrack is great, and the medical robot is very lovable, so 6 out of 10 for big hero 6.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Such a good animation,"Big Hero 6 is a good animation that has released recently. It gives great mood swings to its audience. When you are laughing to one scene insanely, you can start crying instantly in another one. Baymax will definitely be a cult animation character. Even though, he (or she) is just a robot, he shows more emotion than human beings. His eagerness to learn new things about human body and emotions is flawless. Hiro is the antagonist of the movie who realizes that intelligence is not enough alone without friends and family.A must watch animation of the year.Yet, there are some negative parts. It has some cliché superhero actions and the ending is pretty predictable.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Big Hero 6,"Unusually for a geek, ""Hiro"" is also quite a switched on, charismatic, character who goes to a science fair with his big brother ""Tadashi"" armed with a game-changing ""micro bot"". You just have to think what you want it to do and it can replicate itself, make shapes, move - the applications are endless. Milionaire ""Krei"" offers to buy it there and then but another scientist ""Callaghan"" (reminded me of Sir Ben Kingsley) tells the lad that he is just after it for the money. Anyway, ""Hiro"" decides not to sell and tragedy very prompt ensues. That leaves him alone with only his brother's recently developed nursemaid robot ""Beymax"" (imagine the love child of Bibendum and the Snowman). ""Beymax"" is quite a sophisticated fellow and can tell our hero is unhappy - but nowhere near as unhappy as he is going to be when his ""micro bot' chip flies off to join loads of others. Where have they all come from and who is behind this? His friends are also concerned about him, and they are no slouches either so they ally with their pal, his newly enhanced ""Iron-Man"" style android and battle with their masked foe is joined. I enjoyed this. There are loads of characterisations, plenty of action and the animations are original. There's room for some humour in the writing that also delivers an underlying premiss of understanding and of loyalty to your friends and although the story does become a little contrived at the end, this is a fun story that avoids the standard repetitive combat scenarios and has, across the board, an engaging human element to it.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Not the best, but definitely not the worst","Let's get one thing straight: this movie is not deserving of 1's and 2's. It's not a bad movie. People who would give this thing a 1 out of 10 should in no way be taken seriously. The best way I can describe this movie is it's very...okay. Nothing terrible, but nothing especially good.First, the positives: the animation is great seeing as it's Disney. The relationship between the main character, Hiro, and the robot, Baymax, is enjoyable and engaging.Now, the negatives: I found the movie incredibly predictable. They try to pull a bunch of twists and turns, but they end up dead on arrival. I knew who the villain was, I knew which characters (SPOILER), we've seen this all before. This movie just isn't very original. There were a lot of pointless subplots that only served to dig the writers out of their own hole.The rest, I can't call positives or negatives because they're all just...okay. The characters are...okay. The action is...okay. The plot is...okay. This movie is just so......OKAY. It's a D+ movie. Average. 65%.All in all, it's not a bad movie. Nobody has the right to give less than a 4 out of 10—trust me. This is a kid's movie, though, so if you have a kid younger than, say, 14, they'll enjoy it. It's harmless. If you're curious, I suppose it's worth a rental. Again, not a bad movie, it's just something we've all seen before.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
laugh out loud funny and entertaining from beginning to end,"We are lucky to be witnesses to the second ""Disney Renaissance"" at this moment in history. For anyone that doesn't know what that means, do you remember when Disney had a golden streak of winning movies in the early to mid 90's? (Aladding, Little Mermaid, Lion King etc.). Well, that is basically what is happening now. In the span of 5 short years, Disney have given us Tangled, Wreck it Ralph, Frozen and now Big Hero 6. It's finally happened. Disney have gone back to their roots to give us their traditional brand of storytelling in the contemporary age. I have no reservations when I say that this may be the best film Disney have made in 20 years. From a Disney standpoint, all the traditional characters are there and even though they seem stereotypical at first, I can promise that not a single character is unlikeable or annoying in the slightest. YOu have the young, troubled protagonist with the biggest story arc, the supportive older brother, the kooky and caring aunt (who has some of the funniest lines) and the eclectic group of friends - but almost none of that matters because ""Baymax"" steals the entire show! That's right, the plush, huggable, naive, walking marshmallow of a robot that you saw on the poster and in the trailers gets all the best lines, adds 90% of the film's humour and steals every scene that he's in. In a sense, this might be the ""Aladdin"" of the second renaissance, in that the supporting character is the greatest thing in the movie, just like the late Robin Williams' Genie was. What makes it even better is that the main character (Hiro) and Baymax have a great on screen relationship and genuine bond that makes Baymax feel like a real character and not just a bumbling robot sidekick.When it comes to the plot, I won't spoil anything, but I will say that this is Disney's first (and hopefully not last) attempt at a superhero movie, origins and all. In conclusion, I implore you to see this movie, whether you love Disney, Superhero movies or just exciting, entertaining movies in general. Big Hero 6 is everything a good family movie should be - heartfelt and touching, exciting, compelling and utterly hilarious to the very last joke.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Brilliant Movie! 8/10,"Review: I really enjoyed this movie! It's got something for the whole family and the different characters and great animation, added to this very well put together movie. Its about a little boy called Hiro whose a technology geek along with his brother who builds a huge marshmallow type robot to cure human beings when there not well. After sadly losing his brother to a massive fire, Hiro goes into depression and seeks answers to why the fire really happened. He then uses the robot (Baymax) and his new geeky college friends to get to the bottom of how he lost his brother and he finds out that it's all due to a chemical that he had made, which gets into the wrong hands. There's fast action throughout the movie, with comedy and some emotional moments. The different geeks in the squad, all brought great elements to the group and Haymax made me laugh. The vibrant colours and great animation also made this Disney spectacular, a joy to watch and I can truly understand why it made such a profit at the box office. Its not very often that I have watched an animation movie that has something for adults as well as the little kiddies so this movie definitely gets the thumbs up from me. Enjoyable!Round-Up: Disney have really stepped up there movies lately with movies like Brave, Frozen and Wreck-It Ralph but they have still brought out some duds like the Princess and the Frog, Tarzan and the awful Planes: Fire & Rescue movie. Now that Marvel have moved to Disney, they have really smashed the box office, which is what keeps the big executives in Hollywood begging for more. With Frozen and the Avengers franchise making over a billion dollars, Disney have really come back with a bang and I'm sure that this movie will be reaching the billion dollar mark soon. I just hope that they don't ruin this great concept with a awful sequel! Anyway, I didn't hear any familiar voices throughout the film, so I can't really comment on that but the mannerisms and face expressions of the characters were brilliant, even though Baymax didn't have a mouth or a nose. The main character, Hiro, had some anime traits which I have seen in some of the old classics like Akira and the Ghost in the Shell and the movement of the microbots brought a dark flavour to this happy go lucky movie.Budget: $165million Worldwide Gross: $652.1millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their animation movies about a squad of geeks who want to take down a masked, evil-doer who has stolen the geeks chemicals to work against them. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
An action-pack animates film.,"This movie was AMAZING in IMAX 3D. The animation and visual style were just amazing. I loved it. The characters are all memerable and charming. The story, while decent was a little clice and predictable at times. The twist that doea happen I found EXTREMELY predictable. I suppose kids wilk be suprises by it, but adults will see it coming. Watching this film at home doesn't look as impressive as when watching it on the big screen, but it's overwise a suprisingly entertaining film, with alot of heart, which I 100% recommend. 😁👍🏾",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
An action packed and hilarious film for all ages,"Watching Big Hero 6 was some of the most fun i have had in a movie in 2014. Disney really hit it out of the park with this awesome movie that both kids and adult will love. I felt that this movie had a perfect blend of action, comedy and emotional moments that really work with each other and make the movie very entertaining at all times. At no point during this movie did i feel that i had seen the same thing before, as it was unpredictable and clever as a result of good writing.The animation is as usual amazing and beautiful just to look at. The characters in this movie were definitely the highlights, especially Baymax. Not only did each of the main cast have their own unique and entertaining personality but when they were together their chemistry made for many very hilarious moments. So whether you are a kid or an adult you will laugh, and you will be fully entertained from start to finish in this very fun Disney and Marvel adventure - 9",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
It's like Avengers but for kids,"I liked it but I thought it was nothing special. I think it is a good movie for kids but not for adults so that's why I am giving it a 7/10. To me it was exactly like Avengers but for kids. There is a lot of action in it but there is also a couple of ""awww"" moments so I'd say that it is nicely balanced. The story has depth but not enough in my opinion. Hiro is a likable character, a bit unrealistic but then again I keep forgetting that this movie's targeted audience is kids. It's just that I expected a bit more. There is a lot of animated movies I love like How To Train Your Dragon, even Tangled but this just isn't one of them. It left kind of a bland impression on me but I still liked it and I still had some laugh out loud moments while watching it. Overall enjoyable movie, in my opinion not interesting enough for adults but a good movie for kids! :)",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Another Disney classic in the making with memorable and touching characters,"""Hello. I am Baymax, your personal health-care companion.""I can't avoid going into a Walt Disney Animation Studio film with high expectations considering they very rarely get it wrong, especially when John Lasseter is involved in the production. Big Hero 6 is their latest animated film, and this time they teamed up with Marvel so there was much more to get excited about. Big Hero 6 delivers everything it promised in the trailers: fun characters, stunning visuals, entertaining action scenes, and a lot of heart. Let me begin with the aspect of the film I found most fun: the characters. This is basically an origin superhero story about characters I had not heard about. They really don't have special powers, but they are science enthusiasts who come up with great inventions. The lead character, Hiro Hamada, is all about making easy money as he destroys his opponents in robot battles, but when he meets his brother's friends who are all working on cool science experiments he wants in. His brother has created a personal health-care companion that looks more like a giant marshmallow than an actual robot. Its name is Baymax, and is by far the most endearing character in the film. Since it takes everything literally most of the comedy comes from it misinterpreting things (Marvel always has some character who behaves in this way) and the sweet way in which it reacts to different moments. It is the heart and soul of this film and the chemistry between it and Hiro is what elevates this film and makes it more endearing. Pretty much every character in this film has some sort of distinct personality and they all have their comedic moments. Big Hero 6 has its emotional moments as well as we deal with the death of one of the characters. It is standard at times and even predictable in the direction its heading, but it never ceases to entertain with a fun action-packed and comedic pacing. You have the superhero element on one hand and the touching relationship between Baymax and Hiro on the other. So there are several reasons why you can find it pleasing. It's hard to avoid comparison with The Incredibles and I think it does live up to the same level of enjoyment we got from those memorable characters as well.So on the one hand you get plenty of action scenes because this is a superhero animated film where they face a mysterious villain, while on the other it remains emotionally engaging and touching with the center core relationship between this personal health-care companion and Hiro. The film balances these moments extremely well and thanks to the memorable characters Big Hero 6 will surely become another classic from Disney Studios. I've focused my review on the narrative structure of the film, but I can't leave out how good the visuals are here. The city where the action takes place is San Fransokyo, a combination of San Francisco and Tokyo. The architecture from both cities is combined here and makes for a gorgeous to look at futuristic city. I loved the way in which they blended these two styles together and the film looks amazing and culturally diverse. Add that to the charismatic characters and you have an instant classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Big Hero 6 Was a Blast,"From the makers of animated successes/cash cows, Frozen and Wreck It Ralph, comes Disney's first dive into their recently acquired bin of Comic Book IP, Marvel's Big Hero 6. Now seeing as Big Hero 6 was based off the comic book of the same name, first things first, does it resemble the comic at all? No.Thankfully it seems this is a reimagining of sorts, so no outside context is required to understand the movie. It's just a story of a little brother's depression and how one overcomes grief. The best part of the movie's story is with the brotherly relationship between Hiro, Tadashi and oddly Baymax. Disney just seems to have a real understanding of sibling connections. Like with Lilo and Nami, Elsa and Anna and now Hiro and Tadashi, all these connections feel natural to watch and enjoy. And after the guaranteed tragedy this brotherly motif gives us a more subdued story of grief from Hiro, wanting to bottle up his sadness rather than express anything. But his brother's protector role transfers to his hug-gable invention Baymax, and the two continue the quasi-brother motif from then on. The best moment of Baymax and Hiro relationship is a shot of Baymax and Hiro watching the sunset as the sunlight silhouettes them. If you really look for the similarities you'll notice the rapid growth of their connection isn't just emotional but subtly physical which was a nice touch.But hell you could've not had the scene in there and Baymax would have still sold the movie for me. Everyone in that theater I watched Big Hero 6 in with loved Baymax. Every innocent gesture, every clumsy mistake and every heartfelt pillowy soft word that came out of him invoked a grand reaction from the audience and it's hard to not notice why. Design wise, like the movie states, he has a cute non-threatening look to him that makes him very naturally appealing with a big soft body and cute little eyes, and his very basic personality connects well with people on a very base level. In fact the whole relationship of Baymax and Hiro reminds me of another robot and kid combo movie I saw a while back. Can you guess which one?Yep, The Iron Giant. In fact Big Hero 6 would what I call the Brother's version of The Iron Giant, with its similar focus on familial and surrogate familial connections. Big Hero 6 however has one advantage over Iron Giant. It's a Marvel Action movie so, it takes full advantage of Disney's CG Animation department to its fullest extent, giving us some super creative fight scenes and the visual treats of seeing more ""practical"" super powers from the 6. The world of Big Hero immerses itself with technology that is practically used right now, the biggest example being 3D printing. The inclusion of this technology makes the world a lot more practical to view, not realistic obviously; I'll wait until I see a giant marshmallow robot flying around the city until I say that.But what I can say is that Big Hero 6 has a fantastic grasp of animation and movement. With each of the Heroes' varied modes of motion the camera movement matches perfectly to give us the most action packed and fluent shots making every action scene a visual treat to watch. The animation itself is also very colorful and the design itself is like if you mixed the bright colors of The Incredibles and mixed it with the proportions of The Iron Giant, creating a style that's both familiar and intriguing.But with all these positives and fun inclusions, are there any cons to this movie? Well the only con I should warn about are the side characters, Tadashi's four university friends. They are total stereotypes. Badass chick, the dude, the quirky girl with glasses, and the hyperactive black guy. They each fit into these stereotypical archetypes perfectly. However Big Hero 6 has two things that make these stereotypical roles bearable and even a lot of fun to watch. A) Their interactions with Hiro aren't being used to solely fuel their stereotypes. Their interactions work in tandem with the themes of overcoming grief, which gives each of these stereotypes a human edge to them adding some slight dimension. B) The actors who play these four, Jamie Chung, T.J. Miller, Génesis Rodríguez, and Damon Wayans, Jr., just pull off these stereotypes so well. It's like Gus from Psych. You know how stupidly stereotypical these characters are but they're just so good at it you don't care either way. My favorite out of this stupidly stereotypical squad is definitely GoGo for one scene during the climax. No spoilers, but her moment just put the cherry on the total bad girl sundae of her performance. So, if you're into these sort of stereotypical characters then enjoy, if you don't then this maybe will be a deal breaker.Oh yeah, don't worry if you get sad in this movie from the dozens of scenes depicting some really soul crushing stuff. This movie is a cash cow waiting to produce some money flow. Even in the credits it was already advertising that the 3DS game was already out. So this isn't the last time we'll be seeing Big Hero 6, if it continues making such strong box office returns. So, what do I think overall? Big Hero 6 is a super fun movie. Despite what I mentioned about its theming, it isn't deep by any stretch of the term. However it understands the message it wants to convey and knows how to do it in a concise and fun way with fantastic flowing action, great characters and some sublime animation. So, if you want a movie experience much in the lane as The Iron Giant, but with more punching, then check out Big Hero 6.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great Family Fun,"Let me make this short and simple--If you couldn't find humor, warmth, and just a plain good time with this animation, you take life waaaaay to seriously. Get off your high horse and find your inner child. Yes, you, with the two and three stars who make it seem like this movie is such an abomination. Not every movie has to be a magnificent work of unfathomable genius with some epic, life changing meaning and complex character development reminiscent of the drama in your own life that has turned you into such a Scrooge.This move was awesome. It was funny...it was sad...it strayed away from the typical children's movie formula and actually addresses death, grieving, and relationships meanwhile keeping its rated pg charm. Most of all, it was HILARIOUS. It was goofy, silly, fun type of hilarious.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

How to train your robot,"I cannot say that the movie was not nice. The animation was good and the feelings expressed in it were what kids probably need. However, the story was a melange of various concepts, just like the name of the fictional city the plot is supposed to take place in: San Fransokyo. It's How To Train Your Dragon with robots.In this world where 14 year olds can use the resources of a single mother/aunt to build plane like flying robots, microrobots that can link with each other and perform whatever task the mind of their controller can think of, Hiro (said 14 year old) has to impress a teacher in order to get into a robotics university. Things go well until his brother dies, which pushes the little kid into a quest for justice and revenge. A lot of wondrous 3D graphics later, it all just comes into place.I cannot imagine why this mediocre film with a predictable story and really unlikable characters has the high rating it has on IMDb. For me it wasn't a failure, but it was a severe disappointment. There was absolutely nothing in the movie that was above average.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Must win the Oscar for 'Best Animated Movie' in 2015.,"Big Hero 6 tells the story of child prodigy, Hiro(Ryan Potter). Hiro is a natural at creating robots. His elder brother Tadashi(Daniel Henney), works in a robotics lab at a university in San Fransokyo. Hiro spends his time using his robot to fight other robots for money. However, Tadashi doesn't approve. Tadashi tells Hiro to join the university & work in the robotics lab with him, Fred(T.J. Miller), Go Go(Jamie Chung), Wasabi(Damon Wayans Jr.) & Honey Lemon(Genesis Rodriguez). Hiro is also introduced to Tadashi's inflatable health care robot, Baymax(Scott Adsit).Big Hero 6 is a mind blowing movie! There's something in it for everyone. Apart from being an animated movie, it's a superhero movie as well. This film made me laugh, cry, provided thrills, is visually stunning, suspenseful & action packed. It's a complete package. The animation is first-rate. The 3D in the movie is outstanding. San Fransokyo is a flawless fusion between San Francisco & Tokyo. However, the reason that this movie is the best animated movie of the year is, the inflatable balloon-like fat robot, Baymax. Baymax steals the show in every scene he's in. He's the most adorable robot in film history! In one scene, Baymax will make you laugh & in the next, he'll make you tear up. All this is very impressive considering that Baymax's face consists of two cameras & a line in between them. Scott Adsit should be given half of the credit for making Baymax so lovable. The other half of the credit should go to the Disney animators, for creating this chubby, caring, bear hug-able robot. Ryan Potter is brilliant as Hiro. Daniel Henney is great as Tadashi. T.J. Miller is hilarious as Fred. Jamie Chung is good as Go Go. Damon Wayans Jr. is effective as Wasabi. Genesis Rodriguez is impressive as Honey Lemon. James Cromwell, Alan Tudyk & Maya Rudolph are excellent as, Robert Callaghan, Alistair Krei & Cass respectively. The animated short called Feast that was shown before the movie is amazing. Go for Big Hero 6 with your entire family. Yet another Disney masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Iron Marshmallow Man Flies in San Fransokyo,"""Big Hero 6"" occupies a visually dense and splendid alternate anachronistic future world--namely, the city of San Fransokyo--a portmanteau of San Francisco and Tokyo that aptly reflects the picture's American-Japanese hybrid universe, which itself is a result of the Americanization of the comic book's Japanese settings as created by Americans for Marvel. For the most part, however, the focus is on the relationship between Hiro (sounds like ""hero"") and his inflatable marshmallow-man-looking robotic healthcare provider, Baymax. ""Big Hero 6"" is at its best after Hiro equips Baymax with a suit that's a mix between Iron Man and Buzz Lightyear and flies atop him through San Fransokyo and through a trippy portal. This is the brilliance of computer animation, for no other cameras can soar through a space in this manner, nor may that space otherwise be so wonderfully designed. Even live-action productions need resort to virtual cinematography and CGI for such tasks.Otherwise, the narrative here is flawed, while I would've favored more sight-seeing of San Fransokyo. The elaborate backstory involving robot fights, the science-y mumbo jumbo and the seemingly requisite tragic incident considerably delays the more amusing bromance antics between Hiro and Baymax and the eventual superheroics. The other four members of the superhero team are poorly developed and, consequently, uninteresting. As is the supervillain stuff for the most part, although the movie does play around a bit with the trope of an evil corporation and executive. The Iron Man parallels seem further extended by this, as Hiro turns away from profiteering over his microbots in favor of aiding mankind--or at least employing technology to improve his own superheroics--as well as being blown back by a fiery blast that hurts him (it's a different kind of hurt, Baymax)--like Tony Stark. Plus, it always strikes me as odd, if not deviously hypocritical, when a multinational conglomerate like Disney peddles even a hint of an anti-corporate message. Regardless, ""Big Hero 6"" is alone worthwhile to see for Hiro and Baymax soaring.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wonderful work form Disney,"Big Hero 6 is a departure from Disney's usual lineup in a number of ways.Firstly, the film is not a musical like its 53 older siblings in the Disney Classic Collection. It is definitely a character piece, although given its comic-book background it may be more fair to address it as an origin story.Secondly, the story has a much stronger appeal for adult viewers. While young children will most certainly find the film appealing in a strictly visual capacity, the story is engaging enough to hold the attention of seasoned and cynical viewers. The plot isn't anything new - in fact it's quite simple. But the delivery is excellent.And finally, the characters. Gone are the days of The Little Mermaid or Aladdin whose characters are, apart from an overly powerful curiosity or kleptomania, basically just warm and fuzzy saints with only mild surface flaws. In Big Hero 6, the hero (or antihero in this case) is full of angst and character flaws that highlight some of the film's darker undertones. Obviously the movie doesn't linger in those areas - it isn't The Godfather and any seeing the film should know better than expect that. But it is definitely a shade darker than its older brothers and sisters, and it has some more human, more real characters that I think add much needed value to the Disney lineup.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great movie,"I am not usually impressed with recent animation movies. It takes hard work and a lot of talented people to make a kid's animation appeal to kids and adults all the same. And nowadays it is not enough for a movie to be targeted to kids only. For example, the movie ""Book of Life"" contains a lot of adult humor that kids will not necessarily understand. Big Hero 6 is something else. I went to watch it with my kids without having great expectations about it. I thought it would be the typical mess where a movie might be funny and action- filled but at the same time forgettable. Big Hero 6 is wonderfully made. Not just visually. The ideas behind it, even moral lessons that are well hidden so that they are not parent-like sounding, the real-life lessons it teaches are more than great. I have not seen a recent Disney movie that I liked as much. Frozen that became a hit does not compare to this movie. I hope this movie becomes as big as Frozen, because it certainly deserves to be. The people behind it should all be praised for a job well done.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Very good origin story, boring villain","Big Hero 6, based on one of those small time Marvel superhero teams no one has ever heard of, is Disney's first foray into moving some of its acquisitions into its animated movie canon. Marvel was a really big purchase on their part and it makes sense that they would want to utilize their newly acquired intellectual property in some capacity.And they chose a really small-time Asian themed group with almost zero fan base. Which was exactly the right choice. They still got to play with Marvel themes and styles without being tied to the expectations the fans had built with the success of Marvel Cinematic Universe. The movie was allowed to swim or sink based upon its own merits. And, I'm glad to announce that we have a swimmer.Big Hero 6 bets upon many of Disney's known strengths. To be specific, the visuals are fantastic, the family relationship between the two brothers is unbelievably strong, the characters are phenomenally creative and the whole story has a good feel of an adventure driving it. Hiro is a young child prodigy, who has gotten a bit cocky because ordinary life really offers no struggle for him. That is until his big brother Tadashi introduces him to his university, and for the first time Hiro is truly challenged to achieve something just beyond his considerable grasp. And then tragedy strikes.Though, to be fair, it's not a perfect film. The villain is pretty weak, first of all. You can easily guess who they're going to be and from there it feels pointless and pandering. Plus, while the team Hiro puts together, the whole Big Hero 6, is nice and all, I don't think that we really get to know any of them. They are a collection of quirks and nothing more. Hiro is fully fleshed-out, as is Baymax, his robot assistant, but none of the rest are.Still, it's a solid superhero film, visually gorgeous beyond belief and the first act is some of the strongest stuff Disney has ever done. Easily recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
An interesting first entry for the Disney/Marvel duo,"Much like Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) released the same year, this movie is too based on a comic book property that is rather obscure. The title itself is also comparatively vague in its description. However, it seems that Marvel knew what they were doing because for their add campaign all they had to do was stick their soft round mascot as the main attention grabber. The actual story behind these two things is a young boy named Hiro who lives in the future city of San Fransokyo. There, he earns money by competing in illegal robot fights. Upon being rescued by his brother Tadashi time and time again, Hiro didn't want to do anything else. That is until his brother introduces him to the college he attends where robotics and science join hands to improve the way of living for future generations. This immediately catches Hiro's interest and he ends up meeting new friends along the way including Baymax, the white marshmallow looking cuddle balloon. Together, they form a group of six super heroes to stop a mysterious threat.With writers Jordan Roberts (March of the Penguins (2005)), Daniel Gerson and Robert L. Baird (Cars (2006) & Monsters Inc. (2001)) penning this story, the end result was bound to be something worth while. The overall play out is almost what any viewer would expect but there are a number of traits to it that make it a family movie that stands out from the other generic films. The biggest differences are the characters. Instead of Hiro having a hard time fitting into the college he decides to attend, his brother's friends immediately welcome him with open arms and have quite a distinct personality for each. The supporting human character audiences will probably enjoy the most is Fred; mostly because of his goofy spontaneous nature. Then again, people will obviously fall more for Baymax. The character of Baymax is innocent and harmless and this is pretty much what makes him so likable.The voice cast behind these characters is noteworthy as well. Baymax (Scott Adsit) and Hiro (Ryan Potter) both display genuine emotion for their roles, it sounds well done. The rest of the cast includes voice work from Daniel Henney, T.J. Miller (Fred), Jaime Chung, Damon Wayans Jr., Genesis Rodriguez, James Cromwell, Alan Tudyk and even Abraham Benrubi (George of the Jungle (1997)). Also mixing well with that is the animation, which is very fluid in movement, and the coloring of everything is bright and visible. Another satisfying fundamental piece that works with the animation is the action sequences. Hiro and his friends end up making body suits with powers that relate to what they are best at in the school. This leads to some very intriguing and creative fight sequences that aren't normally exploited when it comes to super powers.Henry Jackman who has proved he has enough experience producing music for family friendly genre and action related films provided the music for this movie. The best moments to this movie are when Jackman focuses more on the emotional moments between Baymax and Hiro. The action cues are appropriate but there isn't a main theme for the character(s), so it doesn't stick out as much as one would think. The only issues this animated/superhero film has are the usual things that come to mind. The usual are continuity errors and convenience of plot points. Some of these moments really are just thrown in order to avoid smart writing. And of all things, how does a piece of equipment work by putting it back together if it's not connected to the power source that initially made it run? The only other complaint some people may have is the message of sidelining school for superhero business. It's hard to say if the main characters really dropped school but they did forget about it for a while. Not a gigantic problem but it is a bit misleading.For Marvel and Disney's first shared animated feature, it doesn't stray far from its usual formula to attract audiences. Its action, animation, music and characters are developed properly to entertain any audience. However its message of being a superhero over getting an education and the usual animation/story errors are somewhat predictable.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Fun, If Basic","""Big Hero 6"" is fun and has a cute character, Baymax (Scott Adsit), but I honestly found the movie pretty average fare for an animated film. ""The Incredibles"" did animated superheroes a whole lot better, in my opinion. I found the characters in this film very underdeveloped. Whereas in ""The Incredibles"" each of the family members had memorable powers and distinct personalities. Just something about the overall blandness of this film just kinda makes me hesitant to return. The plot is super basic too and I honestly didn't care a whole lot for the twist, I knew that what they set up for was way too obvious so a twist was bound to happen.I guess it's a kid's movie so I should maybe cut it a little slack, but not when there was already a much better animated superhero film that audiences, both young and old, could take something out of. I attribute this more to ""The Incredibles"" being a family drama too, where parents could relate to the parents in that one.Not a bad movie though and I'm sure the young ones will find Baymax funny and cute and will like a lot of the action scenes. Not much for the adults though.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"An Absolute Pleasure for Disney fans of All Ages,","Big Hero 6 is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding voice cast. I think any fan of Walt Disney animation will be very impressed with this movie, it has a storyline that almost immediately takes you in and is very compelling. The character development is terrific, in the space of just ninety minutes it manages to make us feel for seven characters, the studio knew what their aim was for this movie and they achieved it. My only problem with this film is that Tadashi was a very underdeveloped character, we never really get to know much about him, I would have liked to have learned more about his past and what inspired him to create Baymax, and also at least some bit of information on Hiro's parents, it would have added some extra layers to the story which would have been very good. It's a surprisingly emotional film, it may not look like one that has a lot of heart, but it really does, it made me shed a tear on several occasions and I'm not afraid to admit that, the relationship between Hiro and Baymax is very sweet, it develops perfectly throughout the movie and is surprisingly powerful, it has more depth than any other Disney Animation film has in years, that's what makes it a terrific film and a deserving win for Best Animated Feature Film at the Academy Awards. Funny, sweet and very charming, Big Hero 6 is easily one of the best animated films I've seen in years, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good animation or family film.After the death of his brother, Hiro teams up with his robot Baymax and a group of friends to form a superhero team to take down the man responsible.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

I am satisfied with your Care-Obviously one of Disney's best movies,"After the highly disappointing Frozen,I did thought that Disney is going to do it again with this movie,Big Hero 6.However instead of being really of a bad movie,It was rather instead as turned out to be,one of Disney's best movies ever made with just a simple plot,a boy's relationship with his robot .Wait,do I mean a boy and a robot pal,a relationship,no not really its about a boy who decided to turn his pals into superheroes after his brother's death.I know that some reviewers would thought of How To train Your Dragon when I mentioned a relationship between a boy and a robot but it is way amazingly complex than that.Asides of it,everything in the movie was one of the best animated sequence in the movie itself,from the animation to the plot(it did have,but it was hardly obvious and everything is done perfectly) to the music score which is one of Disney's best music scores to date and also to the themes of the movie that is really well played than some of Disney's previous movies and also the jokes that make so much of sense,and yes,Baymax which is one of the best characters in the more,is also really one of Disney's best sidekick since the Genie in Aladdin.On the plus side,you have amazing cinematography and most of the characters,even the minor ones did feel that they did somehow play a huge plot to the movie(and they are very likable too).It is honestly,as to say,the best Disney movie that does not feel like a Disney movie in a good way.It is really sad that many critics did compare to Frozen,like this was not really one of Disney's best movies.However,if you can look at most parts of the movie,it is the BEST animated film this year and the BEST Disney movie since the movies of the renaissance period ,which is obviously Beauty and The Beast.While Beauty and The Beast focuses on the character animation, cinematography and the plot,Big Hero 6 also did the same thing and for some reasons,after watching this movie just now with my brother in the theaters,I obviously love to watch this movie again.This is the movie that has obviously made my week after some rough moments that I did went through this week and I do think that everyone did a well done job,which I forgot,the directing and the voice acting,it can be very phenomenal.I just hope that Big Hero 6 does win an Oscar for Best Animated Feature next year and lastly to Disney,I am satisfied with your care.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Good, Not Great, Points for the Animation","Context on perspective: I think that Frozen is way overrated, much prefer Tangled, and think that The Incredibles is the best Pixar film.Big Hero 6 has a lot going for it. Fantastic animation as expected, some inspired futuristic fusion design and an iconic new friend-type character and source of comedy in Baymax. I think that it is better than Frozen, if only because the story makes more sense and the setting is more interesting.Hiro is a good protagonist, but the film's focus kind of meanders. As someone mentioned in a review that I read elsewhere, there is a really good robotics-focused theme here, but as the plot plays out, that theme gets kind of buried under a business-as-usual villain- driven plot. Which is to say that BH6 doesn't manage the same sort of transcendence as the best animated films, the early Pixar installments in particular.That being said, there is a lot of eye-candy and inspired visual design to enjoy here, and for that reason alone, I think that there is appeal for older/adult viewers. The supporting characters really could have stood some more character development as they are an interesting group, but if nothing else, they'll make fun action figures.If you don't expect too much out of this one, it won't let you down. It's a good time, and hints at the potential of the computer animation medium to tackle truly expansive, futuristic material in the sci-fi vein.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Unlikely, but deserving recipient of title: Best family animated feature ever!!","I promised to take my 5 year old son to the movies. The choices were 'Big Hero 6' or the latest 'Hobbit' movie (in Australia they came out the same weekend). His choice. He didn't hesitate. ""Big Hero 6, Dad"".I am so glad with his pick.There are very few animated family films which actually succeed at entertaining the whole family. This is one of those rare gems, and it may just shine brighter than all the others. In fact, yep, I'm declaring it. Move over 'Toy Story'. Move over 'Shrek'. Move over 'Wreck it Ralph'. Move over 'Finding Nemo'. And as for you 'Frozen', I don't care if you made more money in a weekend than Zuckerberg did last year, you are not in the same league.If you have kids of any age, boy or girl, go see this movie. If you do not have kids, go see this movie.I don't remember ever laughing as often or as genuinely at a Disney, Pixar, or Dreamworks movie as I did while watching this. The main characters are genuinely likable, none more-so than 'Baymax' the big, white, fluffy health care robot, who is converted into a fearsome (but still loving) fighting machine.The story is loosely based on a little-known Marvel comic of Japanese origin. In this adaptation the story revolves around Hiro Hamada, a 14 year old super genius and robotics prodigy. Hiro has struggled to cope after the loss of his parents and finds solace in underground robot fights. His older brother Tadashi, also a robotics genius (but not quite of the 'super' variety) always keen to get Hiro on the straight and narrow, manages to get him to visit the University (or nerd school as he calls it) he attends.Here Hiro meets a bunch of like-minded young robotics and science nerds, and is awe struck by their inventions (including Baymax) and is instantly inspired. It's at this point the story takes off.'Big Hero 6' is not greatly original. But, so what? The basic plot and themes can be seen in just about any super hero movie. Given it's Marvel origins, that's no surprise. So, if you're a super hero movie enthusiast, you'll dig this. If you're over super hero movie films, fear not. You'll dig this. It is funny, exciting, and genuinely heart-warming. I'm not much of an artistic guy, but to me the animation looks fantastic. The fact they made a health care robot which looks like the Stay Puff marshmallow guy from 'Ghost Busters' actually work is some achievement.I'm going to put it out there now and say: Best movie of the Summer.'Big Hero 6'- 8.5/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Refreshing Wholesome Watch,"This movie is not only funny and emotional but it has a good message. Firstly, the movie is very inspiring with cool mechanics and unique technologies that make you want to take a robotics course. For kids and adults the movie makes a point out of being inclusive in its message that everyone can have a career in STEM. Secondly, the main message of the movie is that there is no shame on depending on friends and loved ones. The protagonist is constantly supported in all kinds of ways by people who care about him. The entire idea behind the star robot is that he is there to service others. The movie reminded me of the Iron Giant, an animation classic that probably influenced this work. Thirdly, the movie deals well with discussions on grief. There is a lot of loss in the movie and the main character is introduced as an orphan being raised by his aunt. There are all kinds of examples of loss given in the movie but I can't give details without spoiling major plot points. The plot twist is actually well executed and I personally didn't see it coming. I recommend this movie for anyone who is looking for a wholesome, family friendly animation.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Smart, clever and more fun than a big, huggable robot","""Big Hero 6"" delivers on its very specific promise of being a somewhat comedic (although the family member death toll is quite high), loud, kinetic action-adventure film. The fun mostly comes from its ""Real Genius"" or ""Revenge of the Nerds"" hyperactive brainiac superheroes reacting against ""The Dude""-like ""Baymax"" played by Scott Adsit (of ""30 Rock"" fame). His Spock-ian rationality and calm acts as the perfect comic foil against which to contrast collapsing buildings, dastardly Steve Jobs-modeled villains and very implausible technology weapons (wouldn't have telepathic controls been way more than enough to win the science fair without needing the cooperative robots?). Baymax charms more than any of the human characters all of whom are polite and with a heart of gold other than the juvenilely named ""Go-Go"". The characters are winning than the plot which pulls its punches in the same way ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" does by given the bad guy a good reason for his evil actions (in both cases to same their families). Takes some of the sting of the revenge fantasy angle. Beyond the standard Disney killing off of the mother, the movie goes a little overboard by taking out other family members as well - thought this was a kid's popcorn flick screenwriters? However, lots of Easter eggs, nicely- paced action and some clever dialog make you forget about the plot weaknesses. In short, while you won't remember the film by the time the inevitable sequel rolls out, you'll retain a vague sense of having been entertained.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Nothing fresh nor special. Not for me anyways.,"This film may be for many, but surprisingly it wasn't for me. But then again, I guess that's what happens to have high expectations whenever one hears that a film is well-received and critically acclaimed.The special effects/CGIs were okay and all, but it's the story that I felt was lacking something. I just couldn't put my finger on it but there was something about the plot of the film along with the characters that I didn't quite find to be fleshed out enough.I really did not find myself relating to the main ""human"" character at all in this film, in fact, I found many of the supporting characters to be a lot more fleshed out and interesting than the main character was. I also found the villain of the film to be very unoriginal and not very interesting.My number one problem after watching this film is that the only original take I thought it had was that it isn't a typical Disney movie. Which I don't really have a problem with. But I did not find the writing to be all that fresh at all and at the end of it, plot-wise, it felt as if I was watching another low-budget action-hero film (not counting the CGI) with many of the plot-twists being somewhat dull and predictable. Maybe a lot of heart-warming and tear-jerking moments, but this film failed to grab my interest enough for any of it to take effect.So while not saying that the film is either ""terrible"" or ""awful"", will however, say that it was nothing really fresh nor special. Not for me anyways. So to ""each their own"", but it just wasn't for me.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
An excellent story- a fresh take on an old theme,"First, let me preface this with the statement that I have found virtually every Disney film in existence distasteful. (Sappy characters, flimsy plots, and mushy dialog are my primary reasons for this.)Big Hero Six is a very different film, especially for Disney. There are realistic characters, character development, and an engaging plot. (I mean it about the plot- there are real twists (very unlike something like, say, 101 Dalmations).)The emphasis on technology, science, and Maker culture in particular were all aspects of the film I enjoyed. There was also a significant amount of research involved in the film (from what I can tell)- there were some details that they really didn't need to put in there, but did just to impress people who would get it. (Adding supports to a curved 3D-printed object (in a shot that lasted a fraction of a second) would be the most obvious example.)Anyway, I liked it. According to the Peter Principle, Disney will milk this franchise to death, but this was a film that I engaged in. Film was family-friendly, and will probably help give some kids out there a ""I wanna do science"" mentality.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Disney's first superhero-themed film is no more, no less, a rough diamond","A typical fanboy/hater behavior in review sites is to give 1s and 10s on a whim, although that's rarely fair, like in Big Hero 6, where that behavior became the norm in IMDb, while it's just a pretty good animated movie, that could undoubtedly be a lot better. The story revolves around Hiro Hamada, a young tech genius who wants to find the one that killed his older brother Tadashi, and all this with the help of the later one's college friends, and, most importantly, his recently completed science project, a cute medical assistant robot named Baymax, whose deadpan reaction to everything around him is simply hilarious. Disney is certainly not an expert in the superhero field. In fact the best superhero title of the company was actually developed by Pixar, and it was none other than the critically acclaimed The Incredibles, however, it's first tread into the genre resulted in something very good.Now, while a great film, it's just not worthy of the golden medal. Why? For starters, while all its aspects are well-implemented, they seem to never fully embrace their potential. Case in point, the overall look of the movie. The animation is simply flawless, the character design is very good, the background extremely detailed, and so on, and yet, it's all forgettable; like the superhero costumes of the gang, which look great and all, but also far from iconic enough to go down in history. The same goes with the pacing. The first – and mostly comedic - 30 minutes are as fine-tuned as possible, with each scene seamlessly leading to the next, and with not a single millisecond thrown into waste. From there on, however, it's a bit of a letdown.The film never gets bad or anything, but it could use some work – especially two out of the three available action segments, which look cool, but lack that extra something. The biggest strength of Big Hero 6, however, are its characters. For starters, Baymax is not just another obligatory cute-and-funny Disney sidekick, but the backbone of the plot, since, besides being a great tool for comedy, he also serves as the connection between Hiro and his dead brother, making sure that he is never forgotten throughout this adventure. Additionally, while Tadashi has been criticized by professionals as a ""bland, hunky dude"" that has a useless death scene, he is actually a genuinely kind and extremely likable character that serves as Hiro's father figure in a very good way, and whose death (let's get ready for some fanboy flame), is quite possibly more effective than the death of Mufasa, which, frankly, never left much of an impression to me.Unfortunately, the theme of loss is not explored adequately here, and the same goes for the rest of the good stuff. Hiro's new friends are fantastic, and each one's personality trait adds much to the comedic aspect of the movie when they decide to appear on screen, that is, because this is mostly about Hiro and his inflatable buddy. In conclusion: if I were to describe Big Hero 6 in one sentence, I would say that it's more like a pilot episode of something much bigger than this. In many ways it is very similar to The Incredibles, and in some aspects (mostly the comedy), much better, however it feels incomplete, while Pixar's masterpiece does not. That isn't to say that it should be avoided, though, since the disappointment stems not from how bad it is, but from how much better it could be.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Big hero 6 is quirky but has little to show in it's pedigree,Big hero six came out as encore as possible but watching it again leaves lots to be desired.The star of the show is Baymax really. Hero and Tadashi are cool characters. He's a prodigy amongst all the characters and Aunt May is funny. There are sad parts in the movie when his brother dies. In the end he becomes powerful.Set in the quirky city of San Francisokyo a combination of San Francisco and Tokyo.The animation is highly dynamic and colorful.My problem with the movie is the other characters and pacing also the villain. The villain is to obvious as he was a good guy before. The other heroes are scientists. They have no other personality other than being Big Bang Theory characters. They are all stereotypes of hipsters who could be anything and everything. Act all wacky and quirky but they have no internal motivation other than pity of the passing of Heero's brother and revenge. They all quip.Big Hero 6 feels more like a parody of tropes than a well thought out movie. A very high concept film based on a low concept comic book.But the most damning thing of all?

"""Heartfelt, admirably entertaining, hilarious, and visually stunning Disney-Marvelian fare""","""Heartfelt, admirably entertaining, hilarious, and visually stunning.""Big Hero 6 is one of the best animations of 2014 along with The Lego Movie and How to Train Your Dragon 2.It is a special and more satisfying movie than Frozen in a diverse way (by the way why diverse? because Big Hero 6 is an action-superhero movie and no musical, unlike Frozen it is a princess tale and a musical, so Big Hero 6 has unique elements that diversely differ on Frozen; let's go back into the question above, why is it special and satisfying was it makes us care for its characters especially on the bond of Hiro and Baymax and greatly take consider its dramatic emotional depth moments. It's a touching experience at the movie theater when you watch it there. It's beautiful and amazing when you watch it in 3-D. The sophistication of the marvel of Disney animatronics creatively crafted its ambitious scope on the Marvel comic book series of the same name and its compelling battle action scenes.Big Hero 6 starts at the futuristic hybrid city of San Fransokyo (a portmanteau of San Francisco and Tokyo), Hiro Hamada, a 13 year old robotics prodigy is naturally gifted when it comes in making nanotechnology and high-tech toys and stuffs. He often spends his time on robot fighting in the streets of the colorful city. But his brother Tadashi Hamada, was not impressed by this performance, he wanted Hiro to make use of his brain talent on something more creative like he was doing at the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology.So he invite Hiro into the institute and amazed to see his brother's creation, the Baymax robot. a medical robot doctor capably of helping the sick and the injuredAfter some inspiration advantage, Hiro also wants to go into the institute like his brother do. So he invent a technology to bring it into the school fair that will admit him in the institute.But after the fair, a mysterious fire broke in the institute and his dreams was shattered by a horrific event that will change his life forever.Depressed, Baymax emerges to help his emotional state. Baymax is a cute, kind, and a marshmallow-like robot (which I describe earlier).Baymax is one of the primary characters here. He is basically the funniest and one of the most memorable Disney characters I have ever seen.But there was a contrary here on some drama animations, what makes Big Hero 6 a heartwrenching movie was the use of a rather realistic emotional love and grief, we don't actually saw it much on either Frozen or Wrech-It Ralph. You can see here how much Hiro loves his brother and his creation, Baymax. So you can sometimes call this type of animated movie a comedy-drama one.Also the ending is a powerful one. Unexpected, it is some sort of a brand new beginning world for Hiro and the concept of the movie itself. Don't dare to miss it!On the negative side, the reason why I gave it 9 stars out of 10, was it lacks the originality of some creative, inventive, and critically acclaimed animated movies. It actually copies some of the scenes of some of the past movies like How to Train Your Dragon 2 dragon training scene part. But all in all, it is compensated by something even more unique from its elements, and also for its well-scripted story. Nonetheless, Big Hero 6 will hit its target audiences contented and pleased as they go out on the theater house.Overall, Big Hero 6 is a terrific blast in the theaters.

It is really a cool movie to watch with family as it has all the elements to be a family movie. I as a animation lover would say the story has a big humane touch. It shows no matter what is the circumstances, we value lives over machine. This would not overtake my all time favorite Wall-e, but definitely is on the list. The main reason this would not make it to the top is the violence. I hope some people will understand that animation has given us a window to show kids how to dream of the future, but if we put violence in there it kind of effects. But then there is Baymax, who at no circumstances would harm a human even though humans may do such. That can be taken as a lesson: We at no cost, should promote violence.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Evolutional Disney Animated Film,"This is an absolutely marvelous Disney animated film for all viewers to watch and really enjoy. Disney did a fine job in creating this film. The storyline went to a new limit which was great. The cast selection was alright. They strongly committed to the storyline. The chemistry between the cast members was brilliant which was essential to this particular film and storyline. This Disney animated film reveals to viewers the power of friendship and that there is no limit to it. In the world of today, friendship has never been that important. I wish I knew what real and true friendship felt like. I have been bullied and hated all my life. I have never had a single friend.

The best since Toy Story,"This is my favorite film since Toy Story 3. I can't stress enough how great this movie is, I'm not even worried about overselling it. So I watched this movie today in a HUGE theater but there was only 10 people there including our group, so I was worried that I won't enjoy the movie as much since half the movies are better with an audience, but this was great even with practically no one there to laugh at the jokes cause you are going to do all that by yourself. The graphics are suburb, the plot is suburb and the character are very very interesting. Maybe the reason why I loved this movie so much is because it slightly reminded me of my childhood, I too was into science and robotics, but it takes it a step further with the great techs that the team invents. This is an emotional movie that I at first thought the kids with me won't understand, but the movie plays out the scenes so well that the kids with me (aged 5 - 10) all understood what was happening just by how the scene/music plays out and how the characters react (also I want to mention that English is not our first language, so I was worried that the kids won't understand everything but they did). Although one thing in the film that I didn't really get was the city/culture they are living in, I think it was called San FrancisTokyo or something like that, and some of the character pronunciations and the city decorations came off as Japanese but everything else was American, I am not sure if I am making any sense, but this movie tried to be in a setting that is both Americas and Asian but it only left me confused because it was American 95% of the time. I think it should just have stuck with one, it would have been remarkable and truly innovative-in the same sense as a Black princess- if they were all (or at least most) Asian. This is truly a remarkable film that I will recommend to all my friends, BUT, be warned because there are two scenes that will make you and your companions cry too (I was fighting the tears).",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney's How to Train Your Dragon,"I liked this movie but once I started watching it, I realized how closely it resembled How to Train Your Dragon by DreamWorks animation. First off, the characters are very similar. There's the smart scrawny kid Hiro-Hiccup. The tough chick Go-Go-Astrid. The worry wart Wasabi-Fishlegs. The slender positive girl Honey Lemon-Ruffnut. The surfer stoner kid Fred-Tuffnut (both provided by the same voice). And of course, the lovable non human creature Baymax-Toothless. Both movies even include a flight scene between Hiro and Baymax- Hiccup and Toothless. Also, the main character even helps the lovable creature fly. Hiro gives Baymax wings and Hiccup fixes Toothless's tail. Personally I liked How to Train Your Dragon better because of a more original story but this movie is OK too.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

In no way does this movie deserve 8 out of 10 stars!!!The movie is predictable, flat and no fun!! It's uninspired, unoriginal and uninteresting and I can go on with the negative comments!What's very frustrating and disappointing is that this movie is rated similar to animations like ""Up"" or ""WALL-E"", both amazing animated movies, but it's nothing like these two. Even for kids it's flat, it's very predictable and not even funny!! It really makes me question very hard the ratings on IMDb..Please don't waste your time watching this!

Nice but too much of everything,"Animated mash up, inspired by a lot of superhero movies and Japanese anime: Marvel's Avengers, Power Rangers, Transformers, The Incredibles.

I was frustrated with the tone,"First of all, it was extremely uneven where it kept changing the story every few minutes and became a different movie and secondly, the tones were equally changing from serious to action packed to light-hearted and silly. The story was about this boy who loves going to ""Bot Fights"" for money and gambling because he graduated school at 13 years old. Then he visits his brother's current college and see his brother's invention: An inflatable robot known to heal named ""Baymax"". Then there's a fire in the building and the brother goes to rescue a teacher--inevitably killing him in the fire, but somehow the robot survives and becomes the boy's only friend until the deceased brother's friends become his friend and they band together to become superheroes. The title refers to the friends, the kid and the robot as crime fighters. None of that was in the trailers. I was certain the title was the name of the robot. They should have promoted all the characters of the title on the poster and trailers and re-written this uneven mess. It felt very un-Disney and more like Dreamworks crossed with Anime.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Its funny, emotional and sad in all the right places and you care so much about the characters, especially Hiro and Bay-max! An absolute must for the family.

What a Relief!,"After a long period of major disappointment with animated movies such as How to Train Your Dragon 2 (watch the first one twice instead) and Frozen (Disney's most over-hyped - er, excuse me - popular movie ever...seriously?), we had hopes that this would not be another loser. We were far more than pleased, as it turned out to be a thoroughly enjoyable experience from beginning to end. It was packed with humor (very little of it of the bodily function variety for a change), heart and important life lessons for the younger audience. While I was stunned by the visuals of San Fransokyo and the attention to detail, my wife was equally impressed at how much expression and emotion could be extracted from Baymax - considering he has no mouth and not much in the way of eyes to register expression. There are some interesting - and I do not think for one second unintentional - parallels to the old Scooby Doo cartoons in terms of both plot and looks and behavior of a couple of the characters, but that's forgivable and I think will make the movie that much more accessible to those 40 and under. I won't go in to plot details; I'll just note that this should be a fun ride for any age - nothing to scare the little ones (one 2 second shot of a menacing dark figure in a Kabuki mask is the worst). We also think it was well worth it to see the film on the big screen. If you're into 3D have at it, but I doubt that it would add much to this film - and might actually detract from the beauty of the scenic backgrounds. Having endured the overlong train wreck that was Gone Girl (see our review) earlier this week, Big Hero 6 was a welcome and tremendously entertaining relief.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Best Baby Yet of Japan's Anime and USA's Disney,"We went to the 3D theater to see ""Big Hero 6"" for few reasons. First,my sister who swoons over Hiro invited me, my older sister, and my cousin to see it. Second, it's a Disney film, so even without Pixar's touch, this film may be refreshing to the superhero genre.The story is compelling, especially a death scene which distresses me. Baymax, the fat white robot, is cute and adorable. His lines and fistbump are epic! How I wish he exists for real! Hiro's friends are amazing and different in their own ways. Gogo is the kickass girl and Honey Lemon is a tall girl who wears high heels. The villain feels like a ghost from J-horror films, so a PG rating is very deserved by this film. I like the emotional and moral tensions unfolded in the story run. The plot twists are amazing, emotional, and shocking.San Fransokyo is spectacular. Seeing the torii-themed Golden Gate Bridge, the giant cat statue, and the sumo wrestling-like robot fight are very awesome. 3D is well used, unlike in ""Frozen"". Indeed, the filmtranscends the typically predictable superhero film.I give this 9 of 10 because I'm disappointed that Hiro has to be half-Japanese instead of full. Race-bending has happened with ""The Last Airbender"", ""47 Ronin"", and ""Edge of Tomorrow"" and I think this act backfired with these movies' success and profitability. I thought that the hybrid city San Fransokyo promotes racial diversity but the film falls short into it. Also, the title is misleading. I thought this is the sixth installment of a film franchise that is probably only shown in Japan. Much better if called ""Big Heroes"".Anyway, if you love anime and Disney, you're gonna love ""Big Hero 6"".",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Best Animated Film of 2014?,"The special bond that develops between plus-sized inflatable robot Baymax, and prodigy Hiro Hamada, who team up with a group of friends to form a band of high-tech heroes.As of now (January 2015), the Academy Award announcements have yet to be made. But the buzz has indicated that ""The Lego Movie"" has set itself up as the animated film to beat at this year's awards. And, indeed, it is a strong contender, easily outshining ""The Boxtrolls"" and edging out ""How to Train Your Dragon 2"" (if only because this is a sequel).But the best film of the year is ""Big Hero 6"", without a doubt. Others have called it ""well balanced"", and that is the perfect way to describe why it succeeds. There is humor, there is action, there is a serious plot (with characters actually dying). It is sophisticated enough for adults, but not so dark that it would scare off children. This really has a very wide appeal.Fans of the comic book (if any exist) may be disappointed, because the book and the film have almost nothing in common beyond a few character names. Even Baymax has somehow been transformed from a dragon to a cuddly marshmallow. But perhaps the new incarnations are even better than the old ones? Especially considering how few people had ever heard of the comic book versions.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beautiful movie,Beautiful movie in some places darker than I would have expected but perfect. Visually it is gorgeous but it is in the plot that it touches the heights of animation. I don't think I loved all the characters but the group of heroes works well overall and Hiro is a complex protagonist who grows and develops throughout the movie. Very nice and interesting also the protagonist who is a level above the classic movie villain for boys.,7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Another family favorite!,"The trailers gave so little information outside of Baymax being lovable that we weren't sure what to expect. That worked in our favor because we were able to just sit back and enjoy the ride with all it's twists and turns. The movie was great in every aspect. Once again Disney provides us with great characters and fun personalities. There was enough variety in the team that everyone is sure to relate and love someone. The animation was wonderful. The fictional city is so rich with detail and felt like it was a real city you'd want to live in. And the movie was full of emotions, a little crying and a lot of laughing. And the script was very well written and now my family has a few more quotes we'll be using for years to come.Great job Disney! Another favorite for our family. Can't wait to see it again.

One of the best animated films of the year,"This year is filled with so many great animated films...The Lego Movie, How to Train Your Dragon 2, The Boxtrolls, The Book of Life and now, Disney's new superhero animated feature - Big Hero 6. Adapted from the Marvel comics of the same name which is almost unheard of by many people (including myself), Big Hero 6 is a fun, entertaining, heartwarming and emotional film that's comparable to Pixar's superhero film, The Incredibles.Over the years, superhero films have become more complex and character-driven with thought-provoking, challenging messages to the audience. The same could be said for Big Hero 6 as well. This is a film about the excitement of learning and innovating new things. This is a film that's filled with complex, mature themes such as dealing with grief and loss of loved ones, making the right choices in life by letting go and forgive those who have wronged you.Big Hero 6 is a beautifully made film that's still incredibly charming and fun to watch despite its simple, straightforward and predictable story. The characters, even the awesome high-tech gadgets and suits are very well-designed. Moreover, the world presented in the film (the city of San Fransokyo - combination of San Francisco and Tokyo) is vibrant, colourful and futuristic, which is suitable for the story. Around the halfway mark of the film, we get to see the spectacular aerial view of the city as Hiro and Baymax were flying around to test the newly made armour prepared to fight with the main villain.The key to a successful animated film has always been creating one or two memorable, lively characters that young audiences could identify with, care about and love. The film succeeds the most by putting its focus on the relationship between Hiro, the lead human character and the hilarious, cute, lovable, cuddly, friendly and adorable inflatable healthcare robot Baymax, the heart of the film. The gentle robot instantly steals the show the moment it appears on screen, providing many joys and laughters that you wish you had him by your side as a personal companion/caregiver. He's clearly meant to be the character that every kid (or the kid inside you, for adults) should love. This film did a remarkable job in balancing action, drama and comedy. There are more enjoyable action scenes to satisfy the kids who loves action and several wonderful, hilarious, moving and emotional scenes of Hiro and Baymax together on screen to satisfy those who yearn for something profound and impactful. There are two particularly emotionally moving and heartfelt scenes that brought me to tears.However, the film does have its flaws. The four supporting human characters (including the villain) are quite underdeveloped and it feels like we hardly know them much by the end of the film other than they're friends with Hiro and they will always be there for him. However, it's not significant enough to hurt my enjoyment of the film. Overall, Big Hero 6 is the perfect animated film for young nerdy kids and adults alike. It's one of the best animated films of the year.Rating: 8.5/10Note: Be sure to stay for the after-credit scene.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/11/movie-review-big-hero-6.html",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Better than Frozen I'll bet.,"I wasn't really excited when Disney purchased Marvel, I mean its like two while different worlds being merged together, but the way things are going, I have no complaints, at least for now. Big hero 6 was pretty awesome for an animation film, it had like almost everything, it makes you laugh, cry, whoop, cringe, and makes you feel for the bad guy and Marvel fans, you're in for a big treat when you sit through the credits, trust me you won't be disappointed.I mean Frozen was okay but this one doesn't have sappy irritating songs that continuously pop up until the end and the characters were completely lovable, even the fire breathing lizard guy. The story doesn't bore you to the point that you're aware of every passing minute and to be honest, I don't how else you could give a higher praise than that and animation wise it was quite sophisticated though not quite mind blowing, music keeps you entertained and blends in right with the scenes and most importantly it struck the right chord, touching hearts, jerking tears and most importantly makes you smile at the end and even when you're back on your bed, reminiscing back at those memorable scenes that I am quite sure will have a special place in the hearts of many, especially Baymax. The characters don't get the much needed screen development but as far as I can recall, that was the only gripe, the rest was practically flawless, and here I thought Disney died with the likes of Toy Story and Finding Nemo.If this doesn't at least get nominated for the Oscars, I will build a Baymax of my own to go after the panel of judges, nah just kidding Baymax is not evil, not that I know how to build it anyway. Easily a 9/10 for me.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Adorable, Funny, Clever, Action-Packed Adventure","The movie Big Hero 6 is adorable, funny, and downright enjoyable. The movie is about a young, intelligent, robotics fanatic named Hiro Hamada, voiced by Ryan Potter, who spends his days hustling adults in ""bot fights"" until his brother, Tadashi, voiced by Daniel Henney, introduces him to his college and friends. Hiro then spends his days trying to get accepted into his brother's school to apply his knowledge of robotics to a greater cause. Hiro later develops a lovable bond between himself and an inflatable robot named Baymax, voiced by Scott Adsit. After Hiro encounters a dangerous force that threatens his future and safety of the city, he turns to Baymax and his friends to make a heroic group called ""Big Hero 6"" to fight evil. The movie takes us through an action-packed adventure that provides laughter, tears, tension and relief.The unpredictable plot makes the movie very exciting and hilarious. The movie is funny within the first few minutes which is really delightful because it avoids a slow beginning. Even though this movie is about superheroes fighting evil with intense superhero gear, it does not follow the typical superhero expectations because the heroes handle situations differently than expected. The movie provides realism and surprisingly does not sugar coat certain scenarios. There a certain times where one would think ""wow, I'm surprised Disney did that"" but that surprise is good because it makes the movie stand out from the rest in a new and different way.The characters are so lovable, especially Baymax, an adorable robot whose only purpose is to make others feel better. Because of this, it is easy for the audience to get attached to the characters and engage with the movie emotionally. The movie is phenomenal and appeals to adults as much as children which is a very special aspect.Not only does Big Hero 6 have clever dialogue, great special effects, lovable characters and nice music, but it also pays attention to little details and messages about education and friendship that contribute to an amazing movie as a whole. I will definitely watch this movie multiple times and recommend it ages 5 to 18. Be sure to check it out in theaters on November 7th.Reviewed by Harmony M., KIDS FIRST!

"Pretty fun, not perfect.","So Big Hero 6 is the first major animated film based on Marvel comics and of course it is Disney too. It's about a boy genius who, with a bunch of friends, attempts to stop a villain whom he blames for a recent tragedy. Now what makes this movie quite unique, I think, is the look; the world building in the film is amazing, it makes you want to visit San Fansokiyo and it really does look like it has blended the two cites really well, so the visuals are stunning. And of course the animation helps and as always Disney animations are really nice to watch.I also loved seeing the different abilities each character had, all the different inventions and what they could do was really fun to watch and really set up the fact that science is really fun and we should embrace it, which was good; the problem is though I don't think they used their powers enough so they showed them using these abilities but only for a very short amount of time.Plot-wise, Big Hero 6 was familiar in a lot of aspects but did throw some new elements in there too which kept things balanced between visual references to other films (Baymax' suit is very Iron Man) and downright predictable. In the end I felt the pacing was a bit slow, I kept waiting for the whole thing to really start and get going but, apart from a few really powerful scenes, it always felt as though Disney were holding back for some reason.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie, regardless, there were some very funny scenes I laughed at, some twists I was not expecting, I loved the look and design of the characters, Baymax is one of the best robots in cinema and I think everybody wants one, the micro-bots that the villain uses look awesome and even Stan Lee makes an appearance! So as a conclusion, Big Hero 6 is a good superhero movie, just not the best.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Another instant classic in the new Reinassance,"Big Hero 6 is another symbol of Disney making a comeback after a 10 year period back in the early and mid 2000s of sub-par and average films(with a few exceptions). Like the previous films, this captures the heart that Disney has back in the days of the Reinassance and returns with it in a new generation of kids and a welcome home party for us who grew up with the Reinassance. While the film has a major problem and couple of minor ones, this ones retains the charm. Heck it's better than Tangled and Wreck-it-Ralph, but equal to Frozen in every way(which isn't a disappointment,overrated, or a bad movie at all as a fact).Now the problems, just to get them out of the way, that prevent this movie from being better than Tangled and Wreck-it-Ralph by a long shot and not being better than Frozen at all are like I said a major one and a couple of them. The story while very well written, is predictable and ruins the surprise factor that Wreck-it-Ralph and Frozen had with there well written stories. Another problem is that while Hiro and Baymax are amazing characters, the rest of the cast are underdeveloped compared to to other films in the line- up. At least they are still enjoyable to watch.This movie well worth your time to see in theaters both 2d or 3d depending on what you prefer and it's worth a Blu-Ray purchase when it comes out as well. Great story, great characters, and amazing animation. Also stay after the credits cause after all it is a Marvel movie as well. Score: 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

2014's Best Animated Feature's Brimming with Sci-Fi,"Big Hero 6 delivers a visually stunning and emotionally engaging animated adventure, blending superhero action with a touching story about loss, friendship, and resilience. The film follows Hiro, a young robotics prodigy, as he transforms his grief into purpose with the help of his lovable inflatable companion, Baymax.The animation is top-tier, bringing the futuristic city of San Fransokyo to life with vibrant detail. While the story follows a familiar superhero origin structure, it is elevated by its heartfelt character moments and strong emotional core. Baymax steals the show with his endearing innocence, providing both comedic relief and unexpected emotional depth.Though some supporting characters feel underdeveloped, Big Hero 6 still packs enough charm, action, and heart to make it a standout in Disney's animated catalog.

"A smart, refreshing take on the superhero film with a heart as big as its breakout robotic star.","In the ten years since Pixar gave us The Incredibles, what is arguably still the best superhero movie ever made, Disney acquired Marvel - a canny business decision which gave the animation studio access to a host of other superheroes and villains. Of the entire pantheon of Marvel characters, then, why did Disney choose the deeply obscure Big Hero 6 for its first animated adaptation? Precisely because of its obscurity, as it turns out. As Marvel itself proved with the astounding box-office success of Guardians Of The Galaxy this summer, there's just as much - if not more - potential to breathe new, refreshing life into relatively unknown characters. Disney's version of Big Hero 6 may barely resemble its grimmer comic-book counterpart, but is smart, sweet and thoroughly inventive on its own considerable merits.Budding robotics prodigy Hiro Hamada (voiced by Ryan Potter) spends most of his free time inventing unbeatable bots to make a quick buck in the underground fights that take place all over San Fransokyo. He finally settles down to invent something groundbreaking when his brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney) gives him a sneak peek into the Institute of Technology's renowned robotics programme run by Dr. Robert Callaghan (James Cromwell). But, just as it seems that Hiro's bright future is set, disaster strikes and he is left with only Baymax (Scott Adsit), a huge, amiable marshmallow puff of a robot dedicated to providing the very best health care, to remind him of his brother.For better or worse, the film chooses to focus firmly on Hiro and the unlikely best friend he finds in a robot with two dots and a line for a face. In most of the ways that count, it's a smart move: it ensures that the larger-than-life action and off-kilter humour of Big Hero 6 is grounded by plenty of very real emotion and heartache. Hiro's loss is acute and deeply-felt, and it's drawn with such sensitivity that it will resonate with anyone who's lost someone near and dear.The relationship between boy and cuddly giant robot is also delightfully drawn. It's both charming and bittersweet to watch as Baymax tries to heal Hiro's grief, a wound that won't respond to the medication or antibiotics in his first-aid kit. To do so, the robot with a mochi for a head walks through traffic, wraps himself around the boy to break a spectacular fall to the ground, and basically deigns to become Disney's version of Iron Man. In the process, Baymax becomes the breakout star of the year - a blank-faced, seemingly expressionless droid who will have you laughing, weeping and rushing out to buy toy versions of him to be placed under the Christmas tree.If anyone gets short shrift, it's the rest of the people who make up the superhero team of the film's title. The remaining four members of the team, all friends and colleagues of Tadashi - quirky chemistry whiz Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodríguez), tough-as-nails adrenaline junkie GoGo Tamago (Jamie Chung), neurotic laser-expert Wasabi (Damon Wayans Jr.) and laidback rich boy Fred (T.J. Miller) - are sketched out well enough that they can provide a few punchlines and witty one-liners. But they're only barely involved in the emotional arc of the story.At least it's an understandable oversight - Big Hero 6 is packed with so much detail and depth that it's no wonder someone had to take a backseat. The film not only finds a surprising twist in the story of its antagonist, money-grubbing tech entrepreneur Alistair Krei (Alan Tudyk), it also creates a buzzing, busy world quite unlike anything that's been put on screen before. Hiro's world of San Fransokyo is a happy whirlwind of cultures - Japanese lanterns adorn the cable cars that trundle through the streets, and fortune cats beckon from the awnings of the café belonging to Hiro's Aunt Cass (Maya Rudolph). There's even an Easter egg or two tucked into the film - particularly in a hilarious closing-credits sequence that cheekily tips its hat to the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe.Fans of Marvel's many comic-book properties were no doubt worried when Disney acquired the studio in 2009. Would Marvel's grittiest superheroes and villains be given Disney's trademark cute-ifying treatment? Would their dark, bitter backstories be lost in the translation to the silver screen? At first glance, Big Hero 6 seems to confirm their worst fears. But, even if it bears scant resemblance to the comic book from which it originated, there's still plenty to enjoy in this punchy, endearing take on the superhero film. In its own way, it doesn't shy away from difficult topics like death, grief and the extent one can and should go to seek revenge. That it does so while led by one of the most adorable robots ever brought to animated life is icing on the cake.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Predictable, Boring, Absurd","Full of obvious Disney tropes, flat characters and absurd over-the- top action, Big Hero 6 is a huge let-down.While graphically gorgeous, this sometimes-funny super hero origin story is so contrived you know exactly where it's going thirty minutes before it even went there. It's not just the tropes, really, but rather how everything is so conveniently introduced to play a role later that the movie just never gets to the point of interesting. It's not moving, not particularly fun or funny. But mostly - it's just stupid. I guess suspension of disbelief is subjective but... somehow, I felt like this movie really bent it a bit too far, and for an animated super-hero movie that's saying quite a bit considering the low bar of realism it was set in the first place. Nothing makes sense, and stuff is just happening incoherently.There's all the rest - the dry delivery by most actors falls completely flat, with the exception of Baymax who is excused but only because he's a robot. There is very little acting, writing or joy in this movie. It looks like the department where a ton of love was poured into is the animation, but that does not a decent movie make.This is not The Incredibles for the iPhone generation. It's just... pretty bad.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Delightful Entry,"Into Disney animation. A wonderful story of growing up and learning some things about adolescence. Is it enough fun enough for kids? The 4-10 year olds in the theater that I saw it sure thought so. Irritated me to no end, but I consider that a mark of fine storytelling. Does it have enough sentiment for adults. It sure does. It follows the typical Disney story outline. Which if you don't know, I don't want to mention it here. But you'll see everything there. It's not a bad model, it's a fun one. A nice distraction to a more sullen movie release times.I dig the joy this movie has. The love of comics/superheroes and...the one thing I can say...which is also present in ""Interstellar"" is the embrace of science. It seems to be a rebirth of the appreciation of something we seemed to have abandoned. I dig this movie. Kudos!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Would give 11 out of 10 if I could,"I would have to say this is one of my all time favorite Disney movies. I cannot understand the bad reviews of this film. I didn't have the highest expectations because of some of the critic reviews and have therefore put off watching it, but I was truly blown away by this film. This is a beautiful heartfelt movie with really likable characters and a great overall message about the bonds of family and looking out for one another in times of need. I laughed a lot, cried a few times too.. and finished the movie with that rare feeling of overwhelming joy of when a movie has really blown you away. So much so, that I made this account just so I could review it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Big Hero Sick!!!!!  Great Action, Emotion and Comedy for all","The beginning of November usually means a few things, the beginning of Christmas season, lots of food, and of course at least one kids animated movie. This weekend opens up the season with another work by Disney Animation Studios, or Pixar's rival to some. With the gold mine that was their last movie, Frozen, the cavalcade of animators have once again churned out another animated feature that looks to be fun. Yet can it match the success of their last film? As always read on.The tale of Big Hero 6 is about a boy named Hiro (Ryan Potter), a kid with a knack for robotics. Through the encouragement of his brother, Hiro is inspired to pursue higher education of robotic design and change the modern world. Unfortunately, an accident though, turns Hiro's world upside down, with only memories and his brother's creation Bay Max (Scott Adsit) to help him carry on. However, a new threat surrounding one of Hiro's projects rises from the shadows, and only the dynamic duo can uncover the secrets at hand.So what did I think of the film? I'll start by saying this reviewer loved the film more than Frozen. Yes I know I'm probably shouting blasphemy, but let me explain why. It starts with the story. Big Hero 6 has many of the familiar elements that we love in a Disney film. Hiro's story starts out exciting from the get go, throwing pizazz and excitement into the mix early to grab your attention. But it doesn't stop there, as this story, like any good story, changes up things when you start getting comfortable. Audiences will get to see Hiro's world change as one event happens that completely changes the dynamic of the movie, yet keeps things grounded. Mystery, drama, character development, and more are all built into this tale, intricately weaved to help bring the characters to life without going into too much detail. You might be saying Frozen had that too? Yes, but what's different between these two movies is that Frozen built it's story around a soundtrack and sped through some valuable qualities. Big Hero 6 doesn't do this, and focuses more on the story, with the soundtrack supporting the film during its montage moments. What I liked even more is that Big Hero 6 had a great character development as well, which remained throughout the whole movie and wasn't lost.Let's get off the plot though and talk about some other things this movie has to offer. For one thing the film has plenty of excitement. Hiro and the gang get into some thrilling situations that are packed with high adrenaline. Car chases, fights against technological baddies, and infiltration into quarantined zones are just some examples of what you get to see. Now just because there is action doesn't mean you get ninja warriors beheading their foes, or guns lighting up the city. No, Big Hero 6 has more family friendly action that has some impressive moves that will thrill all ages. What's even better is the creativity in their technology, cleverly designed to integrate science, fun, and technology into one package. Kids will get a little education, albeit a little stretched,, in science that shows how cool physics and chemistry can be. Geeks like me will appreciate each characters design, and the masses will appreciate the animation this movie has to offer. I just wished these scenes were longer and had a little more diversity to them instead of the repetitive moves.However, the big thing kids will remember is the comedy of the movie. Big Hero 6 is full of moments that the younger audience members and I found hysterical. Juvenile actions like letting out air, klutzy stumbles into buildings, and well timed screams had me laughing. Of course being Disney, you can expect some clever dialogue and a few antics that will surely be repeated a thousand times by the population. In particular the fist bump joke and low battery comedy were my favorites, the latter being a cute way to integrate some adult drunk humor into the mix with some good voice work to boot. Yes some of the jokes are repetitive and simplistic, but the timing and delivery are well enough that it makes up for the limitations. To tell you the truth, it's actually the voice work that really makes most of the humor and emotions come to life in this movie.Okay let's wrap this up. Big Hero 6 was a great adventure that is entertaining for all ages. The story is balanced, with an ever-changing story, emotional character development, and action to keep things exciting for you. Yes it lacks the original songs that Frozen did, but the story and creativity in this film more than make up for the lack of top of the chart tunes. Is it worth a trip to the theater? You better believe it as this movie has all the bells and whistles for the silver screen, and has a story to support it as well. So if you are looking for a movie that all can enjoy, get on down and catch this treasure before it leaves.My scores are:Animation/Action/Comedy: 9-9.5 Movie Overall: 8.5-9.0",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Baymax is cool!,"Yes, we have yet another strong entry into the animated film category by Disney. It seems whatever they touch these days turns to gold...I really enjoyed this story and the film. It was familiar but just different enough to make it interesting and fun to watch. It's actually a superhero movie but you'll have to watch to find out why. This was part of the fun and what I thought kept the story interesting.The characters were interesting and fun (especially Baymax). I think Disney may have another popular character on their hands with Baymax. Children in the theatre loved him every time he came on screen and he was an interesting take on a robot. I also enjoyed how his mannerisms and programming were explained in detail which helped very much with the story and keeping things in perspective.As is the norm for Disney, the effects and animation were top notch. That said, I saw the movie in 3D and I can honestly say I don't feel it added much. You could watch this in 2D and be just as impressed.The the only problem I found with the movie was the villain. The whole scenario was fairly predictable. They played it a little too safe with this section of the story and it would have been more fun to have it be as fresh and original as the rest of the film.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pretty awesome but nothing particularly original,"This movie was very colourful and creative and enjoyable. It felt very familiar though. It has many things in common with The Incredibles and The Iron Giant, from general themes to plot, style and even many specific scenes and details. The story of this movie is nothing new, but then, very few movies are truly original anyway.The animation is very good, the humour works really well, the characters are likable; it doesn't go for tired, predictable jokes. Although some of the jokes are a bit obvious, they're still well executed, feel natural and fit in with the flow of the movie. The robot is the coolest character by far. Like E.T. or The Iron Giant or even The Terminator (in the sequel), he learns things and is adorably oblivious and naive. He has simple morals but grows throughout the film. He is a mirror to humanity. His relationship to Hiro is the heart of the movie.But of course, those themes have been better explored in all those other films I've mentioned and this one doesn't break any new ground. In the first major fight scenes, the heroes clearly clash with each-other, they aren't harmonising, but that idea wasn't brought up. There's a thing about looking for a new angle to solve a problem but it isn't fleshed out either; it sounds cleverer than it is. The plot is actually very typical and none of the potential ideas get explored in any depth.Nevertheless, the quality of the visuals, the voice acting, the dialogue, the timing - they're all very good. It has a lot of young, fresh energy. It has a few very funny parts and some quite sad moments that could make anyone shed a tear. Its strength is its simplicity (and efficiency); it doesn't shoot itself in the foot with too much exposition or melodramatics like most films. But again, it has nothing new. It reminded me too much of these other, arguably superior films which I've already mentioned. Every Pixar film is at least as good looking and insightful and touching. Big Hero 6 doesn't have a strong enough pull of its own. But I certainly look forward to a sequel if they can live up to the standard set by this one, hopefully with some improvements.One weakness with the action was that it was too flat. It was easy to follow and cool and crazy and well planned out, but you don't feel the speed, the movement, the flow, the build-up of tension or suspense. It's just a barrage of images. Great for kids probably but it could be much more than that. It's like a kid playing with toys. Each part of the action conveniently fits in with everything else - there's no danger (until we get to ""that part""). The good guys are struggling badly but then, of course, come out victorious. But then there's a twist and they're gonna die... and then they win again, and so on. The movie has little bits of gritty realism, but mostly it cops out with relatively clichéd set pieces.So why a 9? Because it's really well made, doesn't have major flaws, highly quotable and feels like it was made with passion. And just generally it's awesome.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fun filled adventure with great characters!,"Hiro discovers a robot named Baymax, there friendship grows as they're faced with the impending threat of a masked villain.Big Hero 6 has a lot to live up to due to it being made by Disney, this marks Disney's first animated film based on a Marvel comic.Personally I look forward more to films like this that aren't musical. Frozen had wonderful songs, but the characters weren't very likable and the story was predictable, it was just a weaker Disney film.While Big Hero 6 is a little predictable its made strong by the great characters and their respective story lines.As you may be able to tell from the trailers Baymax is a great hilarious character. He is what Olaf should have been.I don't want to go to into detail just know that this film is entertaining, you won't find it annoying or hard to watch.

Baymax!!!,"Let me first say that big hero 6 was one of the best animation movies this year.So big hero 6 starts with hiro and his brother tadashi,there bond together was one of the best parts of this movie. Something happens to the brother and hiro now has this robot baymax. Baymax is designed to help people who are hurt but hiro does a little more than that and makes him into a superhero. Now hiro,baymax,and hiro's friends and must stop a super villain. Big hero 6 took a big step and made it very dark but It worked very well. for little kids it may be too dark for them. Another plus for this movie was the animation,there was bright and very Beautiful to look at. The humor played very well also.overall it was great animation movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good Messages to Young People and a Lot of Fun,"Walt Disney Studio's New Animated Movie ""Big Hero 6"" is based on the Marvel Comic of the Same name. It tells the story of Hiro Hamada (voiced by Ryan Potter), a 14 Year-old genius, living in the fictional futuristic city of San Fransokyo (A hybrid of San Francisco and Tokyo), who spends time participating in back alley robot fights. Hiro and his older brother Tadashi (voiced by Daniel Henney), also a genius, who is a college student, parents are deceased, and they are raised by their Aunt Cass (voiced by Maya Rudolph, of Saturday Night Live Fame). Tadahsi, in order to try to try to get his brother to use his talent for something other than robot fights, takes him to the robotics lab at his University (Where his age will not restrict him from applying), and introduces him to his friends - GoGo Tomago (voiced by Jamie Chung), Wasabi (voiced by Damon Wayans, Jr.), Honey Lemon (voiced by Génesis Rodríguez) and Fred (voiced by T.J,. Miller), as well as Baymax (voiced by Scott Adsit), a personal health care robot Tadashi created. I don't want to go into too much as to spoil the plot, but in a nutshell, a tragic event spurs the plot forward, as Hiro uses Baymax to try to solve the mystery, and the Superhero team eventually forms up. Overall I like it. The film plays has major themes of dealing with loss (Parents and Guardians be warned if you think your kids won't be emotional enough to handle that – It is rated PG), and using your Brain. I like that aspect of it, sending positive messages to kids, comparable to ""Wreck It Ralph"" which had the theme that's it's OK to be different. The only major knock I could give it, is I would liked a little bit more time on the supporting players in the movie to begin with. Other than that, a fun ride, with some good laughs, a lot coming from Baymax's programmed robotic personality. 3 ¼ out of 4 Stars.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Fun, but distractively poor dialogue","This movie in general was a fun family movie, but it really asks you to suspend disbelief and tolerate some pretty poorly-written dialogue.The dialogue was especially bad in the early parts of the film when it felt like a lazily-written sitcom trying to economically tell you the backstory with unnatural and exposition-packed lines to explain the characters, their relationships to each other and their backstories.Because this is based on robots and advanced scifi technology it is a little difficult to get a true feeling for the world of this story.Character choices are a little bit confusing at times as well. For example Hiro invents the very technology that is turned against him (for reasons not really explained), and instead of making use of this technology he created to combat it, he turns to other inventions created by his brother and friends.Unfortunately I guessed two of the major plot ""twists"" very early into the movie so the enjoyment factor was somewhat dampened by that as well.This probably sounds really negative. It's not. This was an enjoyable movie to sit and watch with the kids, but even they were scratching their heads at some of the story elements, so more intelligent writing would have served this movie well.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Marvel-based Disney Movie Stands Its Ground,"Following from Disney's impressive box office wins that was left off with the phenomenon 'Frozen,' I was not exactly sure what I was in for, so I went to check it out with family. Since it's Disney's first animated superhero film, I expected it to reach the ranks of most recent successful superhero movies that have dazzled and graced the movie screens way before it. Upon leaving the theater, I was left bewildered and curious over it all. I know Big Hero 6's origins were initially from a Marvel comic, but the movie has proved that it can stand its ground as a Disney animated feature in its own right. With Disney's incredible winning streak of past Revival Era hits like 'Princess and the Frog,' 'Tangled,' 'Wreck-It Ralph,' and 'Frozen,' I have to say Big Hero 6 is no exception.As much as I've appreciated Frozen's characters and impressive songs, this movie is certainly NO musical of any kind. Instead, it has the potential to reach the ranks like 'Wreck-It Ralph' in terms of a legitimate, yet compassionate adventure story despite it feeling overshadowed by Frozen's currently popular fanbase.In a futuristic tech-based city aptly titled San Fransokyo, the story features 14-year-old prodigy Hiro Hamada with a knack in robotics that he graduated high school ahead of his peers. Hiro's life is forever and drastically changed when a mysterious masked figure threatens to use the boy's intellect for his own devious plot.It has an unusual, yet interesting formula: Disney humor, Marvel-induced action, and a touch of cyberpunk with dramatic themes that strikes an uncanny resemblance to Japanese Anime. The city's setting was well-detailed and finely assembled that it gave off the vibrant concept of ""What would happen if Tokyo ever did fully go cross-culture with San Francisco?"" While 'Frozen' has the likable snowman Olaf, the scene stealer for this movie is inflatable nurse robot Baymax (done with impressive voice work by 30 Rock's Scott Adsit behind the controls) with a personality that displays innocence, but is further backed up by learning human traits around him. Actor Ryan Potter delivered well in voicing boy genius Hiro by balancing both scruffiness and intelligence into his character. That bond between Hiro and Baymax somewhat began to remind me of the one shared between Ralph and Vanellope in 'Wreck-It Ralph.' The character Yokai (though his name is not mentioned in the film) was a formidable villain who doesn't monologue and instead follows his objective in a swiftly manner.The younger ones who still can't fully comprehend the intensity of Marvel's most recent live-action movies will find this movie just as engaging, yet slightly watered-down and heartwarming at the same time. I know the original Big Hero 6 comic featured a mostly-Asian superhero team as opposed to the multi-ethnic team shown in the film adaptation, but I won't bother nitpicking over that. My true nitpicks, however, were that of Hiro's comrades since they weren't further explored enough in terms of their backstories, more chemistry from them towards Hiro, and the pacing felt a little rushed. However, to avoid spoilers, towards the end is something you yourself might not have guessed happening for one of them. Nevertheless, the entire movie demonstrates that you don't have to be an avid comic book fan (like Fred) to understand it completely, but what really matters is that this is an elaborate and entirely different take from the original source material and has made its mark successfully in Disney's current Revival Era with an amazing story and fast-paced action. I acknowledge the critics were right about this movie with its charms and charisma that I'm willing to see (if possible) another adventure in store for these heroes. Am I satisfied with my care? I certainly am...",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
no sequel?,"I'm puzzled how this movie didn't get a sequel.Animation, story, characters, villain it all was great.I do hear that they are making a big hero 6 show I'm positive that the show will be bad.Just give us the sequel instead.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
love this movie,"The movie is based on a teen ager called Hiro Hamada who is a prodigy, as well as a high school graduate. He has quite aptitude in robotics. The the movie initiates with an illegal robot fight and our hero has quite eagerness in it.
Hiro very easily defeats Yama's robot with his prodigious Magnetic-bearing servos, although he has to face little trouble for it.
However, to show Hiro an actual place to utilize his talents his older brother Tadashi takes him to the research lab at the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology, where Hiro meets Tadashi's friends, Go Go, Wasabi, Honey Lemon, and Fred, and also Baymax, the inflatable healthcare robot that Tadashi created. Hiro also meets Professor Robert Callaghan who is an idol in Hero's eyes and also the head of the university's robotics program. Robert Callaghan offers Hiro to join the university under the robotic program. Amazed, Hiro decides to apply to the university.
To enroll, he signs up for the school's showcase and presents his project: micro-bots, swarms of tiny robots that can link together in any arrangement imaginable using a neurocranial transmitter. At the fair, Hiro declines an offer from Alistair Krei, CEO of Krei Tech, to market the micro-bots, and Callaghan accepts him into the school. As the Hamada family leaves to celebrate Hiro's success, a massive fire suddenly breaks out in the showcase hall and Tadashi rushes in to save Callaghan, the only person left inside. The building explodes moments later.
Two weeks later, Hiro, mourning Tadashi's death, inadvertently reactivates Baymax. The two find Hiro's only remaining microbot and follow it to an abandoned warehouse. There they discover that someone has been mass-producing the micro-bots. A man wearing a Kabuki mask attacks them with the microbot swarms. After they escape, Hiro suspects that the fire that claimed his brother may not have been accidental and in fact started by the man in the kabuki mask to cover the theft of the microbots. Seeking vengeance, Hiro equips Baymax with armor and a battle chip containing various karate moves and they track the masked man to the docks. Go Go, Wasabi, Honey Lemon, and Fred arrive, responding to a call from Baymax, and the masked man chases the group. The six escape to Fred's mansion, where they decide to form a high-tech superhero team to combat the villain.
The group tracks the masked man, whom they suspect to be Krei, to an abandoned Krei Tech laboratory that was used for teleportation research until a test pilot was lost in an accident. The masked man attacks, but the group subdues him and knocks off his mask, revealing him to be Callaghan, who shielded himself from the explosion that killed Tadashi. Enraged at the discovery that Tadashi had died in vain, Hiro removes Baymax's healthcare chip and orders him to kill Callaghan. Honey re-installs the healthcare chip at the last second, preventing Baymax from carrying out the kill order. Callaghan barely escapes, recovering the mask as he does so, and Hiro leaves with Baymax, intent on avenging Tadashi.
Back home, Hiro repairs the robot's damaged scanners and tries to remove the healthcare chip again, but Baymax blocks his access port, convincing Hiro with video of Tadashi running numerous tests during Baymax's development as a demonstration of Tadashi's benevolence and legacy. Hiro remorsefully apologizes to his friends, who reassure him they will catch Callaghan the right way.
Video footage from the laboratory accident reveals that the lost test pilot was Callaghan's daughter, Abigail, meaning that Callaghan is seeking revenge on Krei. Callaghan interrupts Krei at a public event and attempts to destroy his headquarters using Krei's teleportation portal. After a lengthy battle, the team deprives Callaghan of his microbots and the mask, saving Krei, but the portal remains active. Baymax detects Abigail alive inside and leaps into the portal with Hiro to rescue her. They find Abigail in hyper-sleep, but Baymax is struck by debris on the way back out, disabling his thrusters. With no other option but to sacrifice himself, Baymax activates his armor's rocket fist and asks Hiro if he is satisfied with his care in order to deactivate him. Hiro tearfully agrees and Baymax fires his rocket fist before deactivating, propelling Hiro and Abigail back through the portal before it closes. Abigail is taken to the hospital while Callaghan is arrested.
Sometime later, Hiro discovers Baymax's health care chip clenched in the rocket fist. He rebuilds Baymax's body, who keeps his memories and emotions due to his health care chip, and he and Hiro share a hug. The university awards Hiro a grant and dedicates a building in Tadashi's honor, and Hiro, Baymax and their friends continue protecting the city.
In the end I can moral that - If we do good, good will happens with us ultimately. And hate and revenge can never be the solution of your angers.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Animated Avengers: Another Superhero Story,"Big Hero 6 in a nutshell is basically an Avengers-style story where A) a team of heroes get together to, B) fight an evil villain, and instead of live action it's done in, C) computer generated imagery. There's a dash of, D) emotional conflicts, and, E) humorous characters, which leads to, F) much of a muchness. Superhero stories are becoming all the same, and trying to hide the clichés and tropes inside CGI doesn't change the fact that most of it has been seen and done before. Big Hero 6 felt at times that it was trying to be a live action film, and might have benefited from it.What did impress me though was the villain whom had a very impressive method of villainy.If you want much of the same as you've already seen but need it to look really pretty, really colourful, and want your kids to learn all about how much fun illegal gambling is, how violence and healing can work hand-in-hand, and how forgiveness comes once you've unleashed that violence, then by all means, watch it.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

Less than Less than Expected,"Ever since I read the flap from a book in the back of my dad's car, I've had a very strong business model. Good is the enemy of great, or rather prevents it. Lots of the Pixar movies are good, which is just fine, but people praise them as being great. There are plenty of great Pixar movies, though. I expected Frozen to be great from all the talk, but it was only good. It's not a dis on the movie, but I was let down because of the fans. Big Hero 6 was endlessly hyped as being great, but it wasn't even good. It wasn't okay. It was sub-average.Big Hero 6 introduces some fun, weird characters, but goes nowhere with them. Act I was as cookie-cutter as the term cookie-cutter. There was the great art and animation typical to a Pixar movie, but that didn't support much of anything. This story is not a bad concept, it's a good concept that set up a scenario I wanted to see. But the events and their outcomes are incredibly generic. Every time the masked villain shows up, every scene with the team trying to work together is so incredibly boring. If a scene ends in the way it LOOKS like it will end from the perspective of the start, that's a huge failure.The worst of all: the ending. I saw it coming as it was happening. But the ol' boys in the story department gave us a big shock that was equivalent of whipping it out in public. They reveal who the antagonist is and...no one gives a small wet turd. It's barely even important. I stopped caring part way through the movie and the ending was great because it gave me the chance to get up and use the bathroom.The voice-acting and animation was okay, but the movie was too in love with itself over how cute the audience thought Baymax was. It was too in love with itself for having a wacky cast and an ""emotional"" journey. I didn't believe that Hiro's brother was reasonable motivation for hunting down the masked dude and the worst thing that happened to him was at the beginning, thus bringing the levels of emotional conflict presented at the start down to a healthy zero. I was satisfied with the care the theater seat took in comforting me, whispering into my ear, ""fear not my sweet, 'tis but a bad film. It passes by like a dream, and fades like smoke in air, or ripples on a stream.""",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
A real surprise!,"I hadn't done any research before watching this other than being aware that the reviews were well received.
As a fan of animated movies I thought I'd make this tonight's movie.
My wife's reaction was less than enthusiastic upon seeing my choice.
But don't you love it when a movie turns out to be a complete surprise and exceeds any expectations you may have had?
I looked across at her to see her laughing and smiling. She thoroughly enjoyed it and so did I.
I would have liked to have given it a 10 but there was just a minor flaw in the storyline which didn't really make sense.
Overall highly recommended for all ages. Great humor, fabulous animation.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Action and Friendship,"Big Hero 6 is a 2014 American 3D computer-animated superhero-comedy film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures—the first superhero film in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series and the 54th overall. The film is based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name.[5] Directed by Don Hall and Chris Williams, the film tells the story of a young robotics prodigy named Hiro Hamada who forms a superhero team to combat a masked villain. The film features the voices of Scott Adsit, Ryan Potter, Daniel Henney, T. J. Miller, Jamie Chung, Damon Wayans, Jr., Génesis Rodríguez, Alan Tudyk, James Cromwell, and Maya Rudolph.Big Hero 6 is the first Disney animated film to feature Marvel Comics characters, whose parent company was acquired by The Walt Disney Company in 2009.[6] Walt Disney Animation Studios created new software technology to produce the film's animated visuals.Hiro Hamada is a 14-year-old robotics genius in the futuristic fictional city of San Fransokyo. Having graduated high school at 13, he now spends his time participating in illegal bot fights. To redirect Hiro, his elder brother Tadashi takes him to his robotics lab at the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology, where Hiro meets Tadashi's friends, GoGo, Wasabi, Honey Lemon, and Fred, as well as Baymax, the inflatable health care robot Tadashi created. Hiro also meets Professor Callaghan, the head of the university's robotics program. Amazed, Hiro decides to apply to the university. To enroll, he signs up for the school's science fair and presents his project. Impressed, Professor Callaghan grants Hiro acceptance. When a fire breaks out at the university, Tadashi rushes in to rescue Callaghan. An explosion apparently kills both Tadashi and Callaghan.What will Hiro do after this?The film is Action film, but contains friendship elements, so I was impressed and moved to tears when I watched it.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Disney movie that leans into the tropes boys love to see.,"Even though Disney has a reputation for being good at the ""Princess"" movies, I have found that the films geared toward the guys are often overlooked gems. This was probably most obvious during the early 2000s with movies like Atlantis: The Lost Empire (2001) and Treasure Planet (2002), both of which were sci-fi movies that flopped. Fortunately, Disney adapts and aligns with popular trends to create some better received films geared toward the boys. Fusing the sci-fi genre with an anime-like setting and superhero theming, Big Hero 6 (2014) has stood up well over time.I think the only weakness of Big Hero 6 is how closely it plays to the standard tropes. Superhero origin stories are seen as necessary for starting a franchise, but there are only so many ways that plot can be explored before it feels too similar to other movies (with Iron Man (2008) parallels being made here). Even the Power Rangers or Voltron-esque team aspect here, the anime trope of the ""power of friendship"" is at least partly useful for getting Hiro out of his depression.While there are admittedly a ton of Disney movies with orphans as the main characters, Big Hero 6 is an important movie for kids to learn how to handle the recent loss of loved ones. I think it's accurate that a lot of boys would turn to anger and frustration at the loss of an older brother and mentor-likely the only person who encouraged and stood up for them. But what we do with that anger is the important thing that Big Hero 6 tries to convey. It's a complex emotion that's often tied to depression-both of which can easily be glossed over.A Disney movie that leans into the tropes boys love to see, I give Big Hero 6 4.0 stars out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great Movie!,"To be honest, I think this movie is one of my favorite animated movies of all time! It allows kids to get in-touch with their emotions.

It also is comedic and very engaging. If you like funny animated movies, then this is a great movie to see.

Bright and inventive yet alarmingly hollow,"The first animated venture from Walt Disney studios that sees them unleash some of their Marvel material, Big Hero 6 is most certainly a young child's fantasy come to life (and a parent's wallet emptying nightmare, the film was 2014 largest animated earner at the Box Office) and an often inventive experience, yet it's also a strangely hollow and instantly forgettable colour filled adventure that isn't even a touch on last year's more deserving Best Animated Feature Oscar nominee How to Train Your Dragon 2.A big problem for the ""big"" film is that is just doesn't do enough to make us really care for any of the characters and as all of us know it's not hard for an animated movie to make us care, they've been making us laugh, scared and yes even cry since the dawn of animation and Big Hero just can't really win us over in any of these stakes, even though at times the film feels as though it hits a new gear, only to be once more bought down by some below average storytelling and a finale so unoriginal even the little ones may find themselves starting nap time early. With a seen a million times before plot line and a seriously uninspiring villain, what makes Big Hero 6 worth your time is everyone's new favourite robot and some truly fantastic animation designs.The lovable lump of huggable goodness that is Baymax the robot is the clear winner here in Big Hero 6. Baymax is both adorable and interesting (something that can't be said for lead whiz kid Hiro) and his animation design mixed with characterisation by Scott Adsit is a sight to behold. I'd go as far as to suggest that if Baymax was even half the creation he ended up as the film would've been far less popular. The other winning element of 6 is the fantastic design and animation work that sees Tokyo and San Francisco mould into one in the newly minted San Fransokyo. When the film sets flight through the streets or the skies above this city, 6 feels like a totally different film and a far more eventful one than it ends up being.With a sluggish central story and some pretty tepid characters, bar a particularly awesome slacker college mascot in the form of T.J Miller's Fred, Big Hero 6 feels like another over-hyped Marvel adventure that is saved by a lovable robot and some visually arresting set pieces in a wonderfully designed futuristic city. Likely to be a favourite of young superhero loving boys in particular, Big Hero 6 is a sadly disappointing slice of CGI that for most of us will be utterly forgettable.2 and a half fist pumps out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check into -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

A good superhero movie that isn't live,I'd heard about Big Hero 6 from a Marvel encyclopedia and wondered how that would translate into a movie. Some things I remember from the original oddball comic while others were less predictable. But the cast here is the main show stealer. Different heroes with their respective differences. And they all band together to fight a common threat just like the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy. That's got to be a winner.

A very good movie from Disney.,"I enjoyed this Disney film as it is a movie about a group of smart kids trying to take on a villain. However, I enjoyed the movie more when it was the kid Hiro and the inflatable robot Baymax interacting as the film was more humorous during these stages. It kind of turns into more of an action film when Hiro becomes dead set on finding out and stopping the person who stole his inventions. Still, it was good in this phase, but watching Baymax cross a room and getting around stuff was super funny.The story has a young boy who has already graduated high school and instead of taking the next step to college, he instead uses a robot to win money bot fighting. His older brother tries to get him on the right path by introducing his brother to his friends from school and his invention Baymax. This does the trick and so Hiro invents something called microbots that the head of the brother's school likes enough to enlist Hiro into the school. Unfortunately, there is an explosion and Hiro's brother dies; however, the strange discovery of a warehouse mass producing Hiro's microbots sends Hiro on a quest for revenge! He soon enlists his brother's friends help as he designs suits that use the super brainy teens specialties as powers.The film has a lot of memorable moments as it is fun watching Baymax first appearances. I also liked it when Hiro was designing the other's suits. After that, it becomes more of an action film as they try and find out the identity of the villain and stop him when they learn of his insane plan. I liked the characters, Baymax being my favorite, love it when his battery is going low and he is petting the cat going, ""Hairy baby.""So, this one was a really good film from Disney. It came after Frozen and a lot of people seem to get angry that this one did not catch on fire the way Frozen did; however, Frozen did have songs that were really catchy so that is probably what gave it an edge. Seriously, I think both films were made by the same person anyways so I am sure he doesn't care that this one did not do what Frozen did as it still performed very well at the box office. Still do not understand why a film with no sets and no actors can cost over 150 million though...",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney but japan?,"One of the best modern animated Disney films out there. The setting is phenomenal, it manages to be both futuristic while also staying completely feasible in our own world.

The 'loss of parents' hero trick is overplayed but here it is flipped on its side where our hero starts without parents and loses family in the same story. Baymax is a lovable sidekick and each of the side characters manage to leave the spotlight to Hiro while also developing interesting and unique personalities that the audience is able to find some of themselves in.

The absolute definition of average,"This movie has to be a prime example of of an average film. I have been forced to watch this movie about 3 or 4 times and can't see why people love this so much. Not even the majority of professional critics can see the why I dislike this film. Anyways, I'm going to go ahead and say that this film had wasted potential. An abundance of Morden day superhero flicks have been the exact same movie just with a differences and Big hero 6 had the chance to be unique but, it's the same thing we have been getting just with animation. Not only is the plot all too familiar however, the its also boring and predictable. I don't have problems with movies being predictable as long as it's entertaining but, like I said it's boring. The villain also sucks complete with a generic personality, generic motivation and a nonsensical plan (see hishe version of big hero 6 to see what I mean). Beside the kid named hiro the rest of the members of the team are cookie cutter cutouts. You got the tough girl, the geeky chick, the loser stoner guy and, the black guy who is just there for the sake of having an African American character ( without actually giving them a interesting personality). They serve Meryl as weak comic relief and aren't that interesting. I will give credit where credit is due, the animation is good though I have seen better making average. The comedy revolved around Baymax is pretty funny though it doesn't always make sense like how is somehow able to pull a lollipop out of thin dust. Overall Big Hero 6 is an average movie. In my opinion at least, if you like it then that's great.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

"An exciting, refreshingly fun approach to the superhero origin story.","Ever since the Disney acquisition of Marvel in 2009, fans of both entities have been awaiting the first true collaborative effort between the companies, and that effort finally arrives in the form of Big Hero 6. Loosely based on a limited series of Marvel comic books, the film is the story of 14-year-old genius Hiro Hamada (Ryan Potter), whose considerable intellect is mostly being used to fleece other inventors in an underground robot fighting ring. This is a point of frustration for older brother Tadashi, whose own gifted mind is laser-focused on helping others thanks to his latest invention, a ""personal healthcare companion"" robot named Baymax (Scott Adsit).After accompanying his brother on a college visit, Hiro is blown away by the talent and resources available at San Fransokyo Tech, and hurls himself into a new project that he hopes will gain him admission into the school's prestigious robotics program. His demonstration is a hit, garnering him attention from a sleazy corporate businessman and praise from the legendary Professor Callaghan (James Cromwell), but the celebration is cut short when a catastrophe leads to the destruction of Hiro's work and the loss of Tadashi, who perishes while trying to rescue others.Months pass, and the disconsolate Hiro spends his days alone in his bedroom, until he stumbles upon Baymax, the gentle, inflatable robot that Tadashi hoped would change the world. Programmed to provide care, Baymax senses the boy's trouble and makes it his personal mission to assist Hiro in moving past the tragedy - but that assistance also involves helping Hiro investigate the sudden re- emergence of the tech he invented, which should have been destroyed in the accident but is now being used by a mysterious masked criminal to wreak havoc and destruction on the city.Co-directed by Don Hall and Chris Williams, Disney's Big Hero 6 is a refreshingly fun approach to the superhero origin story. There are no radioactive spiders or genetic mutations here - the ""superpowers"" wielded by each of the wildly diverse characters are derived solely from technology. The film is stuffed full of original and innovative action sequences, and the thrilling climax is an amazing display of colors, smoke, explosions and special effects that make up some of the most striking on screen visuals of the year.But at its heart, beneath the excitement and the humor, Big Hero 6 is the story of a boy and his best friend, and the relationship that develops between Hiro and Baymax is genuine and heartfelt. Disney fans should be accustomed to having their heartstrings tugged on, and Big Hero 6 continues the tradition of weaving an emotionally affecting tale inside a bright, colorful adventure. It's another feather in the cap for the animation studio, and hopefully the beginning of a long and fruitful partnership as they continue to work alongside Marvel.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Not a classic, but fun, funny, and sweet","If not quite at the emotional or intelligence level of the very best animation, this is still fun and quite endearing. A young computer genius has his life turned upside down by a tragedy, but forges a bond with a goofy robotic blow-up nurse. This robot, Baymax, is designed only to help, not fight. But our hero equips him to be able to be a warrior machine to help take down a mysterious villain who has stolen our wunderkind's invention and is using it for nefarious purposes. The gap between the personality programming and body type of the puffy, gentle, cute robot nurse and it's re-purposing leads top most of the films biggest laughs.If the film has a weak spot it's that the bad-guy is not very interesting, and makes a lot of illogical choices that let our team of good guys (our computer nerd hero 'Hiro' has gathered a bunch of super-brainy grad students to be his back-up team) get away far too easily. The best cartoons almost always have a great villain. But it does have a world class sidekick in Baymax who was created walking a great line between anthropomorphic adorableness and staying somewhat honest to its imaginary actual programming, instead of suddenly becoming a sentient creature. Not a classic, but I'm glad I saw it.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Aiding Hiro and his fellow heroes is the lovable robot Baymax, built by his older brother for personal healthcare and companionship.There was so much going on in this world the film has created. San Fransokyo felt alive and like a realistic city. Hiro is a likable protagonist and Baymax is such a fun character as well.

Spectacular!!,"So so well made and as for the animation probably the best I have ever seen. The film just grabs you and draws you in visually and emotionally. The Sanfransokyo setting is a really clever concept as is the remodelling of the Golden Gate Bridge and the whole city. The whole setting is superb and must have taken a lot of research and animating to achieve the spectacular setting. As for Baymax the inflatable side kick to Hiro, this is an absolutely perfect piece of writing and the imagination of the writers on this one is so inspired. The eclectic array of nerds with their individual talents makes the film and storyline the better. Perfect, stunning and brilliant - I would like to see a sequel?",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Lovable, innocent characters that made you laugh and let you go on a ride of emotions , in the end teaching a great moral story.People expect far too much from movies aimed at children, they seem to forget their innocence and what a great child hood movie should be.An adult, group of friends, family or children on their own.

"Silent sleeper film of 2015, perfect for kids and adults.","This movie, believe it or not, is about to become the number one animated sci fi of all time, beating out wall-e. It will likely stay at the number two spot, but i know that it is still out in theaters, it is possible it just might pull through. I was shocked to learn this after seeing it because I hadn't heard much about it. No chatter from friends or family, no posts on Facebook, no ads on billboards, just one trailer I saw a few months back.Well, I am glad that is has proved to be a rampant success at the box office, even though no one seems to be talking about it. The film deserves its spot as the number two domestic grossing animated sci-fi film, although it really doesn't have much to compare itself too. Looking at the list on box office mojo, Monsters vs Aliens, Lilo and Stitch, Chicken Little, Mr Peabody, and Meet the Robinsons fall behind it. As the list goes on, I see many movies that are more action than sci-fi, suggesting they had to push movies that don't belong on this list into this list. And where are films like Monsters Inc., Cloudy with a chance of Meatballs, and all the other mega hits that could fall into this genre? Possibly because they are more fiction than science fiction?Even though there may be some missing from their classification, I am ecstatic that this film has done really well, hoping it opens the door for more future films that are more sci-fi than complete fiction. Promoting science, creativity, and intelligence as a desirable trait to our youth is something that we don't see enough of these days. When I was growing up, I wish I had been blessed with the opportunity to see movies promoting these core values, rather than the animated films in my youth which promoted acceptance of self and tolerance of others... I'd probably be a successful scientist by now :)Overall definitely suggest the movie, humor had me laughing out loud and chuckling to myself throughout. There are some dry spots in the middle and drawn out scenes, but I really cared for all the characters and they didn't do any thing too cliché or over the top. Good for kids and fun for adults, teenagers should even love this movie since the main character is 14.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Ba da lad da la da la,"Whenever I watch movies on my own time, I typically like to pick ones that will help me prepare for the next film I will be seeing in theaters and reviewing for this column. Before ""Fury"" I watched some war movies, before ""Lucy"" I watched some action flicks, etc. I suppose I forgot to keep that in mind this week considering the three movies I watched most recently before ""Big Hero 6"" were ""The Conjuring,"" ""Interstellar,"" and ""The Godfather: Part 1."" So when an animated walking/talking inflatable white robot walked onto the screen, it was certainly a breath of fresh air.""Big Hero 6"" is advertised as and makes up the perfect movie to take your kids to this season. Focusing on an intelligent, inventive, 14-year-old prodigy name Hiro, ""Big Hero 6"" is a wonderful example of how heroes can come from anyone and anywhere. After losing a very close friend in an accident, Hiro and his newfound companion and best friend Baymax, a gentle healthcare robot who looks like what inflatable sofas are supposed to be, go on a search to try to figure out exactly what happened. By circumstance, they end up in the lair of an evil mastermind and, with the help of some friends, do their best to foil his evil plan while learning the importance of friendship along the way.Young actor Ryan Potter provides the voice of Hiro, the hero of the story. His work was fine, nothing noticeable to criticize or give extra praise to, which is fitting with a lead character. The real credit for impressive voice work goes to Scott Adsit and his hilarious portrayal of the huggable robot Baymax. Even through an auto-tune-like filter, Adsit was able to give character lovable life. Many extra hilarious moments were given to us through Adsit's work, along with the very comical physical actions that were given to this talking balloon. T. J. Miller was another highlight of the film, as he was allowed to let loose with his character. Over the top at times, but overall very funny. James Cromwell, Jamie Chung, Damon Wayans Jr., Genesis Rodriguez, Maya Rudolph, Alan Tudyk, and Daniel Henney also lent their voices to the life of this film.Between the two directors and three screenplay writers of this film, there are loved Disney credits such as ""Monsters Inc."" and ""Monsters University,"" ""Tarzan"", ""Cars,"" ""Meet the Robinsons,"" ""The Emperor's New Groove,"" and ""Mulan,"" along with others. An excellent team was put together to make this film, and with a storyline and character ideas like these, it would have been a surprise if this film had not turned out well. What I didn't expect though, was that it would turn out this well. The story was excellent, the messages were brief but good, the characters were hilarious, a level of emotion was achieved, and the score was fun, exciting, and different. Everything about this film made for an excellent ride, perfect for kids, and a top choice for parents forced to see a ""kid's movie.""There were certain moments and ideas that I wished had been embellished even more. One of my favorite parts of the film was the invention of San Fransokyo: an ingenious crossover between interesting Japanese culture and standard, relatable American culture. The idea for this semi-fictional city was perfect, though I felt like they almost went halfway with it. It appeared as though the final creation of it wasn't a clever combination of the cultures, but rather that they took American culture and made only major things like names and structures Japanese. This is no way reflected on the final result of the film, but it is an area I would have enjoyed a little more thought.Directors Don Hall and Chris Williams did a particularly excellent job of making this film unique. They were given a very stereotypical storyline and they created a world and characters that succeeded in standing apart. Along with having the classic superhero versus supervillain plot, ""Big Hero 6"" also features the current favorite 'unlikely friendship' story. Back in 2010, Dreamworks and Dean Deblois came out with ""How to Train Your Dragon,"" my personal favorite animated film and the 'unlikely friendship' idea created and perfected in an animated film. Hiro and Baymax provided extreme similarities to Hiccup and Toothless from ""Dragon,"" even to the point of having a relationship-bonding flight sequence. ""Big Hero 6"" could have very easily been called a copy of ""How to Train Your Dragon"" had it been done wrong. Thankfully, this film was executed very well, and we have a result that sets itself apart from the formula animated film that is made so often.There were few flaws in this movie, other than that it was too short. When the credits began to roll, I would have been more than content to remain in my seat for another thirty minutes. A collective contribution of excellent animation, fun story, great score, and quality voice work. In the end though, the best part was the marshmallow. So as I walked out of the theater, I couldn't wait for the sequel.I give ""Big Hero 6"" an 8.2/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Loved it but predictable,"Just went to see this movie today in the cinema with a couple of friends and all three of us cried. Definitely a story to watch when you're in a sad mood. does have a few laughs and is definitely a funny tale as well as a woeful one. The only thing I would say is it was quite predictable, especially when it came to guessing who the villain would be, although even then there was a slight twist which I didn't quite guess until it actually happened. Also it has a childish theme to it so I would only really recommend it to people who are into the Children and Family genre. Overall I think it was very well done, an emotional roller-coaster as some would say from beginning to end, and I would happily watch it again if I was offered the chance.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Weak plot but plenty of action, humour and emotional moments","Revolving around a boy who suddenly befriends and takes a great liking to a superficial being amongst a generic group of friends, the plot of Big Hero 6 is considerably weak and cliché, subsequently leaving its plot twists predictable, therefore having very little impact on the viewer.That being said, it is the tone and 'heart' of ""Big Hero 6"" that makes it such a thrill to experience. Even in the thick of the thin plot, its only major downfall, the film feels wonderfully fresh, especially with its fictional location of San Fransokyo, a bustling city that is comprised of awe-inspiring visuals, all thanks to the advances in animation, aiding to bring even the most generic characters just a little bit closer to real life. Whilst it can be easy to miss a lot of it when being immersed in the film, the attention to detail in the animation is wonderful and makes this film pop in a very vibrant and lively way that we have not seen in a Disney film before.The humour, for the most part, is light-hearted and though not extremely witty, it is guaranteed to make you laugh at the innocent (and even not so innocent) jokes scattered throughout. This innocence is definitely present in the film's more emotional moments, which it handles with great delicacy and is one of the key factors in making ""Big Hero 6"" feel so human, making us able to relate to the characters even more and enjoy their story in the film's otherwise predictable plot line.I have hammered this point excessively but while the plot is much too simple, the movie's execution is pinpoint and I believe that ""Big Hero 6"" succeeds in being the film it wants to be; containing the action usually found from a superhero movie genre but coupled with Disney's more magical and yet down-to-earth 'human' moments. The fresh take on the superhero genre and the beat followed in the tender 'heart' of the film will create a long lasting impression and inevitable love for the characters at the end of the cinematic journey, leaving you yearning for more.""Big Hero 6"" is so close to being on par with Pixar's ""The Incredibles"" but that obviously does not mean that you shouldn't watch this film, I would highly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Student is catching up to the Teacher,"There was an interesting cinematic juxtaposition that occurred on the weekend of November 6th, 2014.Just as the silently sputtering and problematic Pixar announced yet another sequel, this time a pointless one to a masterpiece of a trilogy that ended perfectly, we see the Walt Disney Animation division deliver yet once again another surprisingly powerful and entertaining film. Continuing a quality streak that began with 2009's Princess and the Frog, Walt Disney Animation Studio has essentially created a second Renaissance that has delivered quality Oscar-winning films (Frozen) as well as a few surprises (Wreck-It Ralph). With Big Hero 6, we see a great animated film devoid of a love story or princesses that is full of humor, heart, action, and overall entertainment.The Disney formula is alive and kicking in Big Hero 6, as we have the themes of heavy loss, the strong villain, the essential supporting cast that steals the show, and of course minimal surprises that doesn't deviate the movie too far from its main course of entertaining the kids and adults alike. And although the Disney formula prevents Big Hero 6 from reaching the necessary shock in your better comics and comic book inspired movies like The Incredibles, it's still a fun flick that becomes a nice departure from your recent influx of animated and superhero sequels.Part of the requirements of making the ultimate comic book film includes a unique look and feel that distances itself from other works—whether it's the toxic dark Gotham City or mythological-laden Asgard. One of the best aspects of Big Hero 6 is how deep and engaging the world of San Francisokyo is, as the visual range of the city is just as expansive as the environments of recent Disney movies like Frozen, Tangled, and even Wreck-It Ralph. This gives the added visual flair to the chases and action sequences sprinkled throughout the two hours.Just as spellbindingly good as the animation was, it was the powerful and quick-moving script that propels Big Hero 6 to the next quality level. Although it is based off of a Marvel comic, the adaptation is extremely loose, extremely watered-down, and toned down to appeal to a wider audience---while at the same time giving it a necessary dosage of likability that was absent in the original comic. The trio writing team crafted a screenplay that acts like an origin story but paces like a complete film. There just isn't enough time to give the correct amount of attention to the delightful supporting cast of characters (and its crafty anime-influenced villain) but luckily our well-rounded hero (aptly named Hiro) and his robotic pal have strong personalities, and a strong friendship to propel the movie forward. Beymax has layers of depth that the trailers and commercials could never convey.Although the tropes and current financial strategies of the Disney company (and suddenly Pixar) prevents Big Hero 6 from truly reaching the stars (Because we all know what happens to successful Disney animated movies), we are still treated to a well-directed wholesome blend of comedy, drama, and action swirled around a cool comic book setting wrapped in a Disney bow. From beginning to end this film will entertain, will move you, will make you laugh, and will make you cry. Even if it's a few feet from reaching 1999-2009 sans-Cars Pixar level (then again, this epic run may not happen again from any film studio), Disney Animation is doing a fantastic job fully recovering from Eisner's attempted murder of the animation studio.After spending years following in Pixar's footsteps, it looks like the Walt Disney Animation Studio has just about caught up.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hilarious Feel Trip for Everyone,"This movie is the perfect combination of laughter, fun, and emotion. Plenty of Disney feel trips to go around to start the emotional roller coaster but luckily Baymax is there to steal the show with his non- stop antics. This movie is fun for all ages. I went as an adult with my significant other and we both loved it. It's amazing how Disney has the ability to make you fall in love with robots (e.g. WALL-E, Beymax). Plenty of action and excitement for the kids. Lots of laughter for the adults. This movie has great character development and the special effects are out of this world.

The animation in this movie was just gorgeous especially the underwater scene. Congrats to the whole Disney and Marvel team on a great follow up to your masterpiece!

I try to picture me without Baymax but I can't.,"After overdosing on Disney and superheroes, I urgently needed something to comedown.
I would never have expected in life that exactly this film could do it. It is one of the Marvelous Marvel films ever. And has revived some of the Disney tropes that have not been used since the days of Cinderella and the Jungle Book for a good reason.Probably no one is as surprised as me but all these things, all these ingredients and just these clichés have really promised me so that I could not get enough of this movie. Always I have the impression that time is standing still and I have discovered something new and just want to dive into this movie. I know that many things have been changed and there are some things that have nothing to do with the comic but ..
Who cares?
In space it does not look like ""Star Wars"", ""Hellboy"" is not a ""Men In Black"" and the makers of ""Starship Troopers"" never read the book. I was simply impressed, fascinated, encouraged, wanted to train, applauded and even had watery eyes at the end.Despite all these praises, unfortunately, I have to give a few criticisms:
The character relationships are resolved a bit too fast, the team is not exactly balanced and the members do not complement each other very well, it is called ""show, don't tell"" but not ""just don't tell"" and the end again is Typical Disney kitsch, but I think we would not be so over saturated with all the happy ending this movie would stand out a little better. It is a really very emotionally satisfying film that only suffers from the fact that it is between so many films that have tried the same.
But that makes it a hidden gem that I can always admire again.They say we are what we are But we don't have to be.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
excellent incorporation of advanced technology,"If you're into STEM and designing cool stuff and becoming the next Tony Stark, then you'll like Big Hero 6. The technology these guys have, and the brains to use it, is insane. A telling foreshadowing of what future San Francisco/Tokyo might look like, a microcosm of a society run by technology and its continual advancement.Soundtrack by Henry Jackman, the same guy who did X-Men and Captain America. Suits the setting well, and you'll love the main single ""Immortals"" by Fall Out Boy.The animation is crazy; as I saw with Zootopia, I could see how much Disney has improved since Snow White back in 1937. Some pretty nice fight sequences with the heroes' upgrades, and damn! the attention to detail is exquisite. Every scene and shot is SO detailed, down to the last sprocket.Unlike most modern Disney films, this one didn't really feature the theme(s) of following your dreams and/or forging your own identity. It's a hero story, and this is indeed Disney's first time adapting Marvel Comics material. (Disney bought Marvel, after all.) I liked the message of helping others and doing what is right, as exemplified by the robot Baymax. The theme of friendship and sticking together. Of revenge. (Just kidding.)

Entertaining and Compelling,"Big Hero 6 is a movie I could have easily missed, luckily for me I had the opportunity to see it when it went on general release. This is easily my favourite Disney 3D animated movie. The title character Hero Hamada has such an Interesting character arc, it's wonderful to see how his character shifts and changes throughout the story. His motivations are always clear and he doesn't stray away from them, that's so nice to see in a movie with the target demographic of children. Baymax as a character works really well bring out emotions in Hero and the writers know how to use this very well. He also has great comedic timing, he's genuinely very funny. The relationship that builds between Hero and Baymax becomes very compelling, you really care about the situation. The other characters on the team are a lot of fun but this movie is very much about Hero. The structure of this movie is quite strange, when you think about it it can be defined in 5 acts.

This movie is definitely up there with ""Bolt"" and ""Wreck-it Ralph."" It's got an ""Incredibles"" feel to it, and is one of the best movies to come out in 2014. I absolutely loved it, and now I forgive Disney for making the atrocity that was ""Frozen."" This is seriously one of the best, if not THE best, Disney movie ever. This is one of the very few times I agree with Rotten Tomatoes. It holds a 90% ""fresh"" rating, and I think that that is an accurate rating. (It should have been 100%, though. Who are these critics who caused it to be less than 100%? They need to see it again.) I will definitely see this again when it hits our discount theater, and then buy it on Blu-ray the day it comes out. This was apparently based on a Marvel comic, and I wish this movie great success, and hope this will convince Disney and Marvel to open the floodgates for more lesser-known Marvel properties.

A Decent Pile of Disney Trash,"Let me put it this way:....This is by far (along with zootopia) one of the best recent Disney picks but sadly this is not a valuable price anymore, because sadly Disney has become an Trash-Below Average company.This story is worst than simple, is a painful amount of cliches and exposition that gave me a damm headache all along the way
But it improves with the characters, because its so rare to care about new characters in Disney new stuff, that this really gave me a break, I mean these characters are really likeable (with exceptions of course like the worthless plot-twisting-villian) and fun to watch

A wonderful film about friendship and science.,"I was compelled to post here, as I read a few reviews praising this film which mentioned negative reviews on IMDb. Well, I've just been scrolling through all the reviews and couldn't find one lower than 7/10. It's utterly heartwarming to see such a wonderful movie receive almost unanimous praise. I won't go into massive detail about the film as others have already done so, but I found Big Hero 6 absolutely delightful; funny, emotional, exciting, and just dark enough when it needed to be. I've not cried at a film as much since, perhaps, the French movie Intouchable (also about friendship). My only tiny, niggling complaint is that I'd liked to have seen the other characters get more screen time and interaction, but I'm sure that'll happen in the sequel.

Big hero 6,"I have always loved animated films, whether they be by Walt Disney, DreamWorks, Marvel, Miyazaki or any other storytellers out there, but of late I haven't enjoyed the anime style and artwork that has been delivered. Personally I thought Frozen was so over rated, sure there was a couple of good tunes, cool, characters, interesting storyline, but it lacked that special something Mr. Disney and his crew always managed in years gone by to bring out in me. Don't get me wrong I do really like frozen but nowhere near as much as I am supposed to according to everyone else on the planet. I'm not sure what it is that I love about animated films or where the love developed from but I find myself far more attracted to them in my later years than I ever did in my earlier life. So when I heard about Big Hero 6 and the fact that both Disney and Marvel were collaborating together I pretty much had instant tingles, my expectations without seeing a single thing went higher than any film I have anticipated before. What the hell was Big Hero 6 and why hadn't I heard of it up until now?!? Why did I ever stop reading the comics!?!?Hiro Hamada is a young 14 year old boy genius who knows how to make things work, he loves his gadgets and robots. Hiro lives in the futuristic city of San Fransokyo with his brother Tadashi and his aunt who has taken the boys in after the loss of their parents when Hiro was three years old. Hiro spends most of his days creating and then destroying robots in underground robot battles for cash, the robots he creates devastate the competition without any mercy. After being arrested for attending one of these illegal battles Tadashi on the promise of taking Hiro to another back alley for another fight detours to his university where Hiro discovers that the genius gene doesn't fall far from the tree at all. Tadeshi introduces Hiro to his five Uni friends who each are working on their own scientific breakthroughs. Wasabi, Go Go, Honey Lemon, and Fred. Tadeshi then shows Hiro his latest work, a personal walking talking health specialist named Baymax who can cure all with his sweet soft tones and loving temperament. Hiro instantly loves what he sees within the university and decides he must attend. To get into the university the heads of the campus hold a special talent show where potential applicants can show their work and hopefully the university board are convinced enough to sign up the entrants giving them a scholarship to attend. Hiro creates a way to revolutionise life as we know it and wins his way into the university to the joy of everyone. While celebrating and getting ready to leave a tragedy strikes the university and Hiro loses far more than his exciting new project. With the help of his new five friends from the Uni Hiro reinvents Baymax and together the team of 6 become heroes ready to find the truth to what really happenedI thought this film had it all, I loved it from its beginning to its after credits surprise. I laughed pretty much all the way though, Baymax really grabs hold of you by your heart strings, you can't help but fall in absolute love with him. The way the animators make him move and react is adorable and will definitely keep you smiling throughout. The animation is outstanding and deserves so much applause, everything from the 3D art work to the colour to the rendering is perfect, there is nothing to pick at here in the way the film is made. The voice acting isn't any different either, the directors Don Hall and Chris Williams have chosen an amazing cast and all do a fantastic job for their individual characters as well as their group dynamics, with a couple of recognizable voices amongst the fray as well you will totally love everyone.

This once used to be my favourite movie,"When I was in 10th class and this movie was announced, I had no intention of seeing it, because I haven't seen the last 5 movies. That's how much I lived under a rock. By the time I learnt it doesn't have any prequels the movie was long gone from the theatres. So I finally watched the movie when it came on TV and damn this was a movie I'd have loved to see! Later on I got to know this is based on the Marvel comics, so technically this is the first Marvel movie I have ever watched (because I live under a rock, remember?).The reason why I liked Big Hero 6 so much is because of Hiro Hamada. I have always been interested in robotics and have participated in a robot combat competition myself. Other than that I was preparing for JEE so I was as such very much into science. So right off the bat we begin from a relatable protagonist. Tadashi was also a very nicely made character. When both Hiro and Tadashi go to his college my focus was on how nicely they both talk. It actually feels like they are physically there, as Hiro looks around and Tadashi gives remarks as he gives Hiro a tour. When he shows Baymax to Hiro the part where Hiro thinks he just made a duct tape shows how natural their behaviour was. The other characters were also very interesting, although I don't remember their names anymore since I watched it so long ago.The movie has all kinds of emotions that make it appealing to the audience. It will make one laugh, cry, angry, excited, scared and awestruck. The heroes, villains, story, plot twist, emotional conflicts and even the little details scattered throughout the movie have all been placed very well. Just watching the hero-villain fights didn't let me be seated. Baymax is so cute. The Stan Lee cameo in the end was also unique.Overall I'd say the message of this movie is the most important aspect about this movie. A hero, who has lost his brother who was his only family and has gone into depression, is brought back to high hopes with the souvenir that his brother left him. His brother's friends were there to help him, his step-mother was supportive of him and overall everyone around him was always wanting the best for him. This is what finally allowed him to be the superhero. His emotional conflicts, whether he should entirely act on his feelings or take a calm and collected approach, whether he should kill someone or never harm a person, whether he should use his powers alone or assemble a team, all of this was in his hands. He did everything he hoped will make his brother proud.I enjoyed this movie so much that later on I showed it to my sister and recommended to all the children I met. This is what a movie should be like. It has a good story, memorable people, character development, conflicts, emotions - everything needed to make a good story. These are the most grounded heroes I have seen in any animated movie. I really hope it gets a sequel. I can't have enough of it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Awesome but not entirely perfect,"People haven't been cutting a lot of slack for this film despite its sticking to its PG rating (unlike some of the violence in Tangled or Wreck-it-Ralph) and being supremely awesome. Grieving his brother, Tadashi, the main protagonist Hiro experiments with Tadashi's robot he left, Baymax. Baymax is a health-care robot. They then become superheroes slowly as Hiro the young inventor starts to assemble four other people, Go-Go, Honey Lemon, Fred and the other one whom forms the ultimate team, Big Hero 6. The animation is generally quite good, and 90 minutes couldn't do better. There are also some cool Easter Eggs within the film, highlighted within the Trivia part of IMDb. My first review, however, so let's keep this short: It's genuinely emotional. Just the quirks of being Big Hero 6 for sure.The action sequences are top notch. Really, really, really, good. The character development is sub-par with Frozen. Except without too much romance. So, really, the haters make it look underrated. Just watch and learn. Go see it. You'll love it. Awesome origin story to watch. Thankyou for reading this spoiler-free review.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Beautiful, touching, and larger than life.","As someone who loves animated films, I was not surprised when Big Hero 6 rocketed to the top of my list of movies to look forward to this year. I'm very please so say I was not disappointed. This is the story of a 14-year-old robotics prodigy named Hiro Hamada, his science- loving friends, and--of course--Baymax, a lovable, inflatable robot whose only concern is with the care and well-being of others.One of the first things of merit is the way the film looks. The vibrant city of San Fransokyo may occasionally make you forget it isn't real. The opening shot is particularly beautiful, and a great way of letting the audience know they're in for some gorgeous scenery. The animation itself throughout the film is quite stunning, too. The subtle movement-related details enhance the experience even though it isn't right up-front.The characters in this movie really, truly stand out. There's plenty of diversity--not only in race, but in body types, interests, personalities, and dialogue. The Big Hero 6 become a team of people all distinctly different from one another, but that doesn't hinder their teamwork or the care they have for each other. While you don't get to find out too much about the stories of Wasabi no Ginger, Honey Lemon, Gogo Tomago, and Fred, they're bound to stick with you regardless.The heart of the film is Hiro's relationship with Baymax, and how that develops during some rather difficult times. These two are written beautifully, and in a way that stayed true to who they were even while so much happened and changed. There's a good chance you'll get a bit teary-eyed at least once (or twice).The story is also hilarious and action-packed, but perhaps one of the most meaningful parts of this film is the themes it deals with: loss, grief, and the importance of mental health as well as physical health.Overall, Big Hero 6 is a movie I can't wait to watch over and over again. There could be multiple Oscar wins in its future, too. Highly recommended--you will be very satisfied with your care.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Big Hero 6 was almost a great movie. But no.,"In many aspects, Big Hero 6 is conventional. It follows a linear, action-packed plot with a reasonably likable protagonist and his also reasonably likable friends as they battle a dangerous threat to the world as we know it, smashes the tears out of us with a beautifully animated climax scene, and leaves us feeling emotionally fulfilled. However, Big Hero 6 falls short of its greater predecessors, an acclaimed, almost cultish list that doesn't seem to ever leave us alone with its catchy songs and memorable plots, a list that includes Frozen, Tangled, and Wreck-It Ralph. Its dialogue is clunky, its story is slow and slippery, and it has no catchy songs (I actually hate it when movies have songs so I guess this is a good thing). It feels awkward at times, especially at the beginning, which has the constricting appearance of a plea from parents all across the globe for their children to show an interest in post-secondary education.The film follows Hiro, a young robotics prodigy directing his talents toward the illegal (""But lucrative!"") world of bot fighting whose future suddenly brightens when his brother convinces him to go to post-secondary. But, as with every great Disney movie, things fall apart just when they start looking up. Hiro suffers a devastating tragedy, leaving him bereft of any ambition that he once had. He deals with the pain of loss (which is a rather mature theme for a Disney film) with the help of his brother's healthcare robot, Baymax. Baymax, a white, pillowlike robot, is an attempt at making an adorable memorable creature that everyone loves, but he falls slightly short of classic Disney characters, like(the first coming to mind being) Stitch. His lack of ""adorableness"" is mostly due to his serious, completely non-robotic, 50-year old man voice. But he has his moments.The villain is great. He is sinister (almost too sinister) and one-sidedly cruel. Although, when the mask comes off, you find yourself sighing at the obviousness of what was under it in the first place.There is no denying it, however. Big Hero 6 is beautifully animated, its action scenes are spectacularly choreographed, and it is easily one of the best animated films of the year.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Big Hero 6 = big action and great family fun !,Big Hero 5 is simply a great time at the movies. The Message is clear. We can all be heroes. The story is somewhat cliché when Hiro's Brother Toshida is killed in a lab explosion. and Hiro's tech is stolen. he discovers his brother was left to die by the villain. Hiro uses his brother's invention a medical inflatable robot Beymax Who provides some of the movie's greatest moments. and with the help of his brother's friends and lab partner's they go after the villain. Along the way Hiro learns to never confuse Justice with Revenge and learns with the help of his friends into learning how to become a real Hero My kids loved it. The movie was full of comedic moments and some sad moments that truly wrench at the heart. But the more important aspect here is the life lessons you learn along the way. You don't need a inflatable robot or powers to be a hero. You can find that power inside you. The movie was wonderfully done the animation was perfect and flawless. The Story was a good strong one and solid. Will there be a Big Hero 6 II I hope so if they can make it as good as they made this one.,10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very impressive use of 3D. Go Disney !,"Just because they released Interstellar at the same time, people are giving this movie less than what it deserves. An excellent film in every aspect, and I dare to say, better than Interstellar.Good story, amazing visuals, brilliant portrayal of various futuristic applications of science (unlike fantasy stuff in Interstellar), and funny at all the right times.I am a big Disney fan, and my love for Disney films increased manifold with the release of Wreck-It Ralph. Big Hero 6 takes that bond even further.I'd recommend this movie to everyone. A must watch. Go Disney !",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Big Hero Sucks,"First things first: this isn't a terrible movie. It's just bad. Just your average, everyday, fairly common, bad movie. If you don't agree with me, I'd be happy to tell you why...The characters in this film are a stereotypical, cookie-cutter, sitcom cast (You've got your Shaggy, your Lara Croft, your white girl, and of course the manly-looking one who acts like a baby), the writing is garbage, the jokes aren't funny, the dialog is clichéd FOR DAYS, the plot devices are overused, the plot twists all seem forced, the soundtrack is forgettable, the cinematography is minimal at best, the visual design seems a little too similar to The Incredibles, the addition of the superhero team in the movie is completely unnecessary and doesn't help the film at all, not to mention all the superheroes seem like Ben 10 ripoffs, and finally, all the story arcs and major plot points seem to be directly stolen from films like ""The Iron Giant,"" and ""Brother Bear.""Big Hero 6 is a bad movie. That is a statement that can be backed up with factual evidence. It definitely isn't a horrible movie, but it certainly isn't any good. So then why does everyone worship it like it's the arc of the covenant? The answer is simple: Baymax.Baymax is Big Hero 6's money machine. He's their Olaf. His role in the film is trick people into thinking the movie is good so they'll recommend it to their friends. And I'll admit it, he won over my heart. He won over everyone's heart. You can't deny it, Baymax is a lovable, cute, hilarious character. The thing is, one character doesn't make a film good, and with his character aside, the film sucks Baymax's big squishy toes. The movie hides behind Baymax, and when people walk out of the theater thinking about how much they enjoyed the film...they're really just thinking about how much they enjoyed Baymax. Disney can be an evil genius when it wants to, and apparently in this case their master plan worked, because everybody seems to love the film.I leave you with this final question: if Baymax wasn't in the film, would you still like it? Most people probably would say no. Those who say yes would either be lying, stupid, mentally impaired, or under seven years old.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Marvel + Pixar. It's that good.,"-Big Hero 6 is about a young boy genius who inherits a big, huggable, and very uninformed medical robot. When a super villain arises, Hiro (the boy) decides to make a team of heroes to stop him! -Big Hero 6 is what you get when you cross a Marvel comic and a Pixar film. It's pretty good! (Yes, it actually is an Action Hero, which is Marvel, comic!) I was impressed.-The story is cliché, and although it doesn't deviate from the Pixar feel, of the family-friendly origin story feel, the combination of them was still very refreshing and well done! -It is very well paced! It is deep and full of heart, but also full of funny moments! I will say that if you only want the funny moments, the best ones ARE in the trailer.-The voice-cast does very well, with the villain being my favorite! -The music was very good and fun and fitting.-The animation was on-point. Along with most everything else.-The robot, Baymax, was sooooo funny and adorable!! I want one! For realz. I want a Baymax and a Toothless.-Content: It's PG. So yeah.-So Big Hero 6 is a great combo of superhero and Pixar and, although cliché, does a great job! I honestly think it is the best animated film of the year! So I will say that Big Hero 6 is worth seeing in theaters! I will give it an 8/10!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Overshadowed by Frozen,"This movie came out Nov. 7, 2014 and then Frozen came out exactly 20 days later. This movie is amazing and so underrated. The animation is absolutely beautiful and the whole movie was just ugh chefs kiss.

"Great to See, Tugs at your Heartstrings","Marvel Meets Disney - it's a kid's version of an action movie with some great lessons:Push the boundaries of your personal, unique creativity. Love your family. Love your friends. (Fight against villains.... well I wouldn't teach that, but it's a movie)The coloring and the animation style are superb. I did NOT get tired of looking at everything.It's a family-fun movie and it deserves every bit of its 8+ stars.Tugged at my heartstrings, more than it tickled my funny bone.I consider Finding Nemo a 10 star movie. This movie didn't have the level of Adventure, clever characters, or adult-level humor that Nemo has - but it's still a solid movie.Good Pace. Interesting ideas. Great Message. Superb Animation.It gets an 8 because it's a solid A movie. Have fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Chicken Soup for the Nerdy Soul,"If you ever had to deal with the pressures of growing up a nerd, this movie feels your pain. It will wrap its big white fluffy arms around you and say, ""you belong"". So sit back with some hot popcorn and let this fantastic cinematic confection press all your awesome buttons. You're in for a dose of roller-coaster therapy.Let me begin by saying the animation in this movie is beyond fantastic, and this movie plays out much like any live-action film would, as opposed to following the traditional structural formula of animated films, and I think its Japanese influence has a lot to do with this. The influence of Tezuka and Miyazaki are strongly felt. The visual environments at times are so photo-realistic it actually looks as if our animated characters are inhabiting a live action world. I was so swept into it, there were times I honestly forgot I was watching animation.Which brings me to our Hiro. If you don't recognize this character from your school days, you were this character in your school days. Let me say, he brought back memories, and I haven't identified more with an animated character, ever. Allow me to explain:In fourth grade I formed a club called The Technologists where we'd take apart old computers and appliances to see how they worked. As a kid, I was obsessed with the concept of human flight and one day being an inventor of flying machines. Hiro's circle of friends are extremely relatable as well. I hung out with kids like these. In middle and high school we had to form lunch groups in empty classrooms or computer labs to escape the wrath of the student body, while we played some of the first online multi-player games, or discussed the likes of JRR Tolkien and Frank Herbert, or whatever fantasy worlds we inhabited. But a certain loneliness nevertheless came with being a nerd. One that led to a longing for adventure, which in turn typically led back to Middle-Earth, Narnia or Arrakis. Which brings me to the most beautiful and touching point this movie makes - adventure is therapeutic. Hiro's entire journey, as facilitated by Baymax, is medicinal, and no matter your mood, there are moments in this film that will make you forget your worries and cry tears of awesomeness. You're along for the ride, and if you're like me, you're going to come out exhilarated and empowered.Yes, you'll catch whiffs of other classics, such as Terminator 2, E.T., Stargate, and How To Train Your Dragon. But that doesn't drag down the movie for me. The only thing I would have loved more than what I saw would be if the movie had a classic-rock soundtrack. Nonetheless, I think I have found a new comfort movie.I am satisfied with my care.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Superb animation with disappointment story,Watched this with my little cousin. The animation is excellent. And it did create an atmosphere of San Franokyo. But showing the beautiful landscape did not help to push the story arc forward. This movie just wrapped a generic story arc under a robotic future look of SF.5/10,5.0,Anonymous,Animation
