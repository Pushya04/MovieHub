pleasant surprise,"I went to a small advance screening of this movie on July 19th, knowing no more than the names of a few of the actors and that it was a fantasy/adventure quest of some sort.The plot line really is nothing like I have seen, and a unique story is certainly appreciated with everything else that is currently in or coming soon to theaters. In spite of what first impressions may give, it isn't cheesy, corny, tacky, or ridiculous, and is actually highly entertaining and funny. The flow is quite well done, nothing seems rushed or dragged out. The soundtrack, for lack of better words, is magical and adds much to the film, as opposed to simply filling the silence as often happens in movies or TV. And even though I might have known what was coming at points, I still couldn't bear to stop watching the screen; to my knowledge, not a single person left the theater during the entire movie.My one gripe is that there seems to be almost no marketing for this film, and as brilliant as it is I can't figure out why.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Provides more fun than all of the summer blockbusters put together,"The 14 year-old in me is immensely happy that they're now able to make really good looking fantasy movies, and that they're all the rage, what with Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia making loads of cash at the box office. This year will see (and already has seen) several more, most notably The Golden Compass, which has the most exciting trailer I've seen this year. Stardust, based on a novel by Neil Gaiman, showed up in theaters this week with little more than a peep. I saw no previews for it, only a couple of commercials. The critical reaction is kind of blah. I wouldn't even have seen it if not for the fact that I have to wait on a friend to see The Bourne Ultimatum, and that nothing else interesting opened this weekend. Well, if you'll forgive the horrible pun, the stars must have been rightly aligned, because I went to see Stardust, and I loved it. It's not a huge movie like Lord of the Rings. The plot line is your very basic fantasy quest (the hero sets out to look for a fallen star) filled with obstacles. But within that basic outline, the story is lively and imaginative. It's simply aiming to be a lot of fun, and a charming little romance. And it succeeds wonderfully. There were a lot of big films this summer, but none of them were nearly as fun as this one. There's a lot going on, but the story is told well and is almost entirely coherent. It isn't a masterpiece, but it definitely can occupy the same kind of ground that something like The Princess Bride has (though I don't like it quite as much as the earlier film). A lot of fun to be had here if you're a fan of the genre.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Much Better Than it Looks,"Surprised at how much I enjoyed this. The characters were really well developed, the world building was fantastic and the action was really enjoyable. Mark Strong is great as ever as the villain, but it has to be Robert DeNiro who just steals the film in the weirdest role I could think of for him. The story is genuinely intriguing, but it's the world building that really did it for me. I really felt immersed in this fantasy world, and the exposition was delivered really naturally. As much as I have gripes with some of Matthew Vaughn's films, the actual direction is never the issue, and it's quite good here too. Now my main issue is that the film is trying to juggle quite a lot of storylines, and it feels a bit rushed as a result. You could probably cut Michelle Pfieffer's plotline down quite a bit in order to concentrate on the main storyline more. But overall, this is a surprisingly fun film that I would definitely recommend",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Previews do no justice...,"Why are the previews so blah for a movie that is so awesome!! Everyone should know what an excellent movie this is. It is engaging and funny from moment one, original, and well-acted. I wish the movie was doing itself as good press as it deserves!For anyone that loved The Princess Bride, Labyrinth, and other truly funny and original fantasy adventure, this is one of the great ones. Robert DeNiro is hysterical. Relative newcomer Charlie Cox is an incredible leading man. Claire Danes is fantastic as always. Michelle Pfiefer is making quite a splash with her recent returns to the screen. There are also a lot of wonderful moments from minor characters...even down to facial expressions.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A magic that isn't puerile . . .,"The power to dream is a wonderful thing. There's a saying, ""Not all dreamers achieve, but all achievers dream."" By exploring our imagination we shape our own futures. Or build empires. Perhaps overcome our fears, limitations and obstacles. Gain wisdom and benefit mankind. Or (put simply) just find our way to true love and happiness. Freud might express such things in symbols. The language of fantasy.Tristan ventures out of a rather twee English village called Wall. He goes through a break in the wall. A portal. In search of something that will prove his love to Victoria (Sienna Miller). Victoria doesn't take him very seriously. So he pledges to bring back a falling star.Stormhold is the world outside the wall. He discovers the fallen star has taken the form of a beautiful girl, Yvaine (Claire Danes). To complicate matters, three evil witches want to get hold of Yvaine. If they can eat her heart, it will replenish their youth. (One of the witches is played by Michelle Pfeiffer, who does fabulous young-old transformations of looks and manner.) The 'good guy' they meet on their way is Captain Shakespeare (Robert de Niro). He has a fierce, swashbuckling pirate exterior but is a sweetie closet queen underneath. Heirs of Stormhold meanwhile are engaged in a pitched battle over inheriting the Kingdom. Ricky Gervais is an added extras. A buffoon trader throwing in standard Gervais-type gags well. Tristan's purity of spirit arouses the love of Yvaine, so there is a nice little triangle going. Till he achieves the maturity to discern pedestal divas from real women.Stardust is a full-on, large scale fantasy that does credit to its myriad stars. Wholly positive, and written with a clarity that makes it more worthy of psychoanalysis that a coven full of Harry Potter romps. Production values rival Hollywood, and the storyline is free of the racial stereotyping, misogyny, religious or class agendas than shape and pervert so many large scale fantasies.That is not to say that Stardust is without its faults. Plot and dialogue have many predictable elements, and the fairytale quality may be too saccharine for some audiences. But if you want an excuse to let your heart fly, this film may well provide it.As a boy, I remember listening in wonder to albums by the Moody Blues (who practiced in a house not far from where I lived). They made records with names like ""In Search of the Lost Chord,"" and wrote lyrics like, ""Thinking is the best way to travel."" I would fill my head with books on magic and mystery, from Timothy Leary to Aleister Crowley. Shaping dreams. Learning to make them real. Nowadays people might talk of NLP or positive thinking. Adults that remember how to dream with the force of youth but with the vision and application of maturity. Do you still enjoy that feeling?You are advised not to wait for Stardust on DVD. See it on the biggest cinema screen you can find. And Dolby Digital Surround Sound if you can get it. The actors look like they had a ball. Maybe you will too.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Overwhelming adventure full of fantasy ,  a love story  and pirates","This fantastic picture concerns a Tristan (Charlie Cox) , a young living in an English village rounded by a wall . But a breach surveyed by a keeper (David Kelly) is the walk for a world fantasy named Stronhold . Tristan trespasses the breach looking for a fallen star (which results to be Ivaine : Claire Danes) to demonstrate his love for a beautiful girl (Sienna Miller). But also a nasty witch (Michelle Pfeiffer) and the King's (Peter O'Toole) heirs (Mark Strong , Rupert Everett) are looking for Ivaine and the jewel she holds . Meanwhile , Tristan and Ivaine get away and aboard a flying vessel full of pirates (Dexter Fletcher , Fogerty) and commanded by a sympathetic captain (Robert De Niro).This exciting motion picture displays derring-do adventure , romance , fairy tale , spectacular fighting and fence and with phenomenal outdoors . The flick gets lots of bombastic special effects including supernatural transformations , flying ships , stars explosions and numerous images have you on the edge of your seat . Riveting set pieces illuminate the full-blown adventures blending witchcraft , wizardry , necromancy and turns out to be extremely amusing . Casting is frankly extraordinary , Michelle Pfeiffer plays magnificently a shamelessly villain-witch and Robert De Niro as the likable gay pirate steals the show . Ideal cast is completed by awesome US and British actors . The movie packs a sensational production design by Gavin Bouquet (Star wars). Mesmerizing photography with wonderful , marvelous landscapes by Ben Davis . Emotive soundtrack appropriately adequate to fantasy by Eshkeri . The pic was brilliantly directed by Matthew Vaughn . He's a good writer, producer (Guy Ritchie movies) and director, though only made one film titled ¨Layer Cake¨ (with Daniel Craig) which achieved big time . Rating : Better than average. Essential and indispensable watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Spectacularly Entertaining Piece of Fairy Tale Fantasy,"'Stardust' was a splendid watch. I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it turned out to be. To me, it seemed like just another passable fantasy flick but 'Stardust' is a lot more than one might expect. It is a fairy tale about a fallen star and a young boy. Vaughn's direction is solid. The visuals are fascinating, even though sometimes the CGI is obvious. The cinematography is stunning and the soundtrack is beautiful. The writing is commendable and the dialogues are fine.Comparisions might be made with 'Lord of The Rings'. While I did not like Peter Jackson's movie as much as others did, I throughly enjoyed 'Stardust'. However, 'Stardust' too has its share of flaws. I thought the ending (in spite of some humorous moments) was a little dragged on and gave the film a fluffy touch. The American actors act very well but some of them lose the British accent at times (at one point Michelle Pfeiffer pronounces the 'r') but this is a very very minor case and the reason why I mention it is because it was something I noticed. This minor point does not make me like the film any less but the unnecessarily stretched ending somewhat does.'Stardust' boasts of a stellar cast that comprises of both British and American talents. The luminous Claire Danes and the naive Charlie Cox have the right chemistry and look convincing on screen. Danes is literally and metaphorically the star of the film. Michelle Pfeiffer springs a surprise performance as the evil villainess. It's great to see her after a long time, that too in a completely different role which she effortlessly pulls off. Robert De Niro too springs a surprise. I won't say much about him because that would be ruining the fun. Let me just say this much that perhaps one will never look at Mr. De Niro the same way. Notice the welcoming cameos that include a magnificent Peter O'Toole, a funnily odd Dexter Fletcher, a hilarious Ricky Gervais and a pitiful Rupert Everett.There are so many wonderfully shot scenes. I particularly liked the pre-climax scene where Yvaine is approaching towards the wall and the camera switches back and forth to the different characters. The cinematography and music add power to that key scene. Of course there are many other such great scenes but this was one I freshly remembered. The scenes between Tristan and Yvaine are quite nice and fun and thankfully they are not overly sugarcoated (except in the end). The light comedy is quite cleverly put and special thanks to De Niro and his pirates, the 6 (?) ghosts and Gervais for pulling them off.On the whole, 'Stardust' is a wonderful film. As stated earlier, i would have liked it more had the ending been a little crisp. Nonetheless, it felt like two hours well spent and I recommend it to those who enjoy original fantasies.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Shop Boy, fetch me that Star","Greetings again from the darkness. This one will be compared to ""The Princess Bride"" and although it doesn't measure up to that classic, it is extremely entertaining and well made in its own right. The story line is a bit odd and the whole wall thing is never really explained, but the execution is fine, even building up strong suspense.Charlie Cox plays Tristan, who falls for the wrong girl (Sienna Miller), and agrees to fetch her a fallen star ... who happens to be played by the stunning Claire Danes. Not much suspense on what happens with these two, but the suspenseful part comes in with the wicked witch played by Michelle Pfeiffer and the prince son of King Peter O'Toole looking to reclaim the ruby necklace our ""star"" is wearing. Lots of bad chasing the good.Along the way, an encounter with the strangest pirate you will see (including any from the Carribbean). Robert Deniro plays Captain Shakespeare - tough on the inside, and shall we say in touch with his feminine side. Another encounter involves the brilliant Ricky Gervais as a fast talking trader and that is good for a couple of laughs.Not your typical chase, coming of age, or fantasy film, but director Matthew Vaughn's (""Layer Cake"") effort deserves an audience. Sadly the poor marketing campaign will probably prevent it from making any money. My guess it will find big success on video.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The most fantastical adventure of the year!,"I went into this film with modest hopes, the director had pedigree, I had seen Charlie Cox in Casanova and was impressed, and literally EVERYONE had been raving about it. As the story started to unfold I was introduced to Victorian England on one side of a mysterious Wall, and on the other a magical land, Stormhold. The actual plot weaves together many strands and I don't want to ruin the surprises for anyone, but at the barest it is the simple tale of a young man (Charlie Cox) in love with the village beauty (Sienna Miller). To win her love he tells her he will fetch back a fallen star from the other side of the Wall. Howver when he arrives at the star he finds not a lump of astral metal as he expected but a beautiful woman (Claire Danes). As the two journey back to the wall they find themselves in the adventure of a lifetime. The visuals are brilliant, England looks stunning, in a similar fashion to New Zealand in LOTR, and it s full of wonderful little flourishes, such as the way that the star shines when she is happy, a very simple effect, but one that looks radiant. As well as this the acting good, especially from the leads and Robert DeNiro, whose turn as the captain of an airship is incredibly memorable. This film is THE perfect date movie, it is romantic without being a ""chick flick"", funny and full of wonderful action pieces that will satisfy any action film fan. All in all it is a truly magical experience from beginning to end, and I now Im raving about it to EVERYONE!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best modern fairy tale adventure in awhile,"Surprisingly good. I watched this based solely on the high IMDB score and, as usual, it was legit.

Best Fantasy Movie In a long time....,"When I saw the previews for this movie I knew I'd love it but I had no idea how much I'd love it - This movie is so entertaining - A young man sets out on a quest to find a star to bring to his ""Crush/Love interest"" to win her hand in marriage - Little does he know, He is not the only one chasing the star - Brothers fighting for the throne are after it - and Some witches want the star - Michelle Pfeiffer, Robert Deniro, and Claire Danes - are the bigger names - And boy do they play their parts well (Especially Ms Pfeiffer) - Magic, betrayal, and love are only a portion of what's in store for you when you watch this movie - Trust me it's a must see - Very original and entertaining from beginning to finish -",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Good Film, Despite the Fact I'm Not a Fan of Fantasy","This movie is very well made. Great cast with both the celebrities you know and those you don't. It has an exceptional score to go with it. Unfortunately I'm just not a fan of pure fantasy and that's most of what story has to offer. Expect a cross between Star War optimism and Lord of the Rings fantasy. It's a fairly bright and positive movie despite the antagonists in the plot. This movie delivered everything right whereas a movie like Eragon failed miserably. If you prefer movies grounded in reality and science, this isn't a movie for you. If you like a fantasy getaway where anything is possible, you can't find much better. Overall it's worth the money, but I wouldn't want to see it again. It has a few too many silly moments and almost qualifies as a comedy. I see no need to rush to a theater. Best suited for a DVD rental.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stardust -- Another Guarded Review,"Stardust Another Guarded Review (originally written June 15, 2007)The marketing machine has only just begun for this one (no site yet? wth?), so I doubt most of you have heard about it. In truth, I hadn't either (sort of). When I got the posting, I thought it was another code name and was actually worried it was Transformers, one of the movies I wanted to see when not working so I can enjoy it 100% as a mere mortal movie-goer. Turns out, it wasn't Transformers and I had been aware of this movie way back when as 'that Neil Gaiman movie'.What is it about? Well, in short, it's a Gaiman fairy tale about a boy and a fallen star. Any more than that and I'd be giving away plot info which is (a) a breach of contract, and (b) spoiling your fun. If you really want to know what it's about, go buy the book. Rumour has it, Gaiman might be something of a writer.Not knowing what to expect in a movie can be so pleasant if the surprise is worthwhile. And for this one, it certainly was. This screening was 'special' in that it included not just film critics, but also exhibitors (they rarely have a mixed screening) and local sci-fi/fantasy folks. So, you know the expected audience, right? I mean, with this crowd and the title of Stardust, I knew what to expect.Oh how sweetly wrong I was.Yes, it is a fairy tale written by an author famed in comic bookdom (and even books without pictures, if those truly exist). But it was not Lord of Rings. It was not even another Lord of the Rings wannabe (ahem, Eragon). It was much more intimate than all that.But, like Lord of the Rings, it was the, well, humanism of the film which sells the fantastical qualities. It's surely a romantic tale, but with generous splashes of humour. Not slapstick Shrekian humour. It's more along the lines of dramedy than comedy. Before I go on, let's do this movie review thing.Acting is, in the very least, good. It's always hard to say more than that for fantasy films but I do believe there were significant superbly acted roles. Michelle Pfieffer is not, sadly, one of those. She plays a villain, and she does the job. Nothing special. Rupert Everett, though, he was a real jerk. That is, a great villain. Peter O'Toole is, well, Peter frickin' O'Toole -- which is marvellous. Ricky Gervais is perfectly cast and shows why. Robert De Niro seemed to be having too much fun for the most part. When he wanted to deliver the goods, though, he did. And Charlie Cox (who?) as the lead character was fine surprise from a guy I ain't never heard of.Claire Danes. Claire Danes. Claire Danes. I've always been of mixed opinion with her. She can be great, and then she can seem to miss the mark. In this, she's the former. And she is, quite literally, the star of this film. Sure, her accent stumbles here and there. And, yes, she's not as good as she can be when Cox isn't in the scene. However ... well, see for yourself.Special effects are muted yet accomplished, and only significant where they should be. Best flying ship yet -- sorry Potter. Direction is light-hearted and flows nicely. Cinematography could have been better but not everyone films in New Zealand. All else is top bracket.And now that that's done......the writing. Oh, the writing! Neil, you devil. It's hard in today's climate to do anything original and, at first, you begin to wonder. A kingdom, a dying King, a boy out to prove his own worth, witches, ghosts, a quest (or three) -- what's new? But Gaiman's story draws you in with its surface familiarity only to subvert it all into a sweetly original tale of a boy and his heart. And, though you suspect how it's all going to turn out, you begin to wonder in the third act and -- if you're me -- find yourself pulled into the rousing climactic confrontation and hoping for the best. In the end, you'll find this story, this movie, is what all fairy tales should be but all too often are not. Fantastical and real.(I wish I could talk about Septimus vs Tristan but I won't ruin it for you. For those who read the book, rest assured, it's done properly.)Those I spoke to afterwards had the same impression I did. A great film for all ages to enjoy, and the new {WITHHELD} for this generation. The blank gets filled-in only after the movie is in wide release because, well, you might be expecting it. You'll know when you walk out, anyway. I sincerely hope Stardust doesn't get lost among the tentpoles. Even if it does, it'll be my pleasure to push into the hands of everyone I know.---Forgot to add the {WITHHELD} reveal. I'm a few years late, but ... ""A great film for all ages to enjoy, and the new THE PRINCESS BRIDE for this generation.""Perhaps a bit lofty an assessment but I'm still confident that years from now, there will be the same ""Oh, I love that movie,"" response to this as there is now for The Princess Bride.(Edited for grammar and stuff. Still rather spastic in tone and flow. I am not Gaiman. Duh.)",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Indirect comedy,"The reason I say indirect because this movie actually has a purpose besides just being funny. As well the humor is never just over the top but simple and in the correct places.The combination of the entire story makes this a movie for pretty much anyone not just a certain group of movie goers. With just enough special effects actions while not over doing it, each part of the experience actually compliments itself. From what I could remember there wasn't anything but good acting within the movie. Not that you couldn't expect much less from Robert Deniro or Michelle Phieffer. But the rest of the cast and even the small parts were written and accomplished well.This could be probably the best attempt I have seen to repeat the greatness of one of the most underrated movies of all time.

I thought all the good fairy tales had already been told.,"OK here is how I do this. I grade movies on 10 components. Each component will inherently start with 5 points. It can then lose or gain 5 points for a possible 10 or 0.Mood: Action, Romance, Comedy, Drama, Suspense - I give this component 10 points. It had a perfect balance of all five aspects. The Action was fun and exiting. The Romance was not overdone, but still very emotional and moving. I laughed hard and long throughout the movie and still I was captivated by the fantastic drama, and riveting suspense.Plot - I give this component 10 points. I thought all the good fairy tales had already been told. I found my self, sitting in the theatre, returned to my childhood, and in that instant I again believed in unicorns, wicked witches, and falling stars that make dreams come true.Cinema Photography - I give this component 8 points. While the movie captured the story very well in the majority of the angles, I found my self more than once trying to figure out what happened just off camera.FX - I give this component 10 points. I love that they used C.G.I. sparingly. The epic scenes were believable. The magical powers were frighteningly realistic. All in all less is more, and this had it ALL! Cast - I give this component 10 points. No names and seasoned actors alike, the cast was amazing! Michelle Pfeiffer was wonderfully wicked, Charlie Cox made Tristan come to life, Claire Danes gave emotion to the stars, and I will never look and Robert De Niro the same again.Acting - I give this component 10 points. Even the newbie actors played their rolls to perfection. Once again, I will NEVER look and Robert De Niro the same again.Character development - I give this component 9 points. This felt a little rushed and I think if the movie had been a bit longer they could have done the characters a little better justice.Dialogue - I give this component 10 points. The dialogue was smart, witty, fun even the mush had good dialogue.Score - I give this component 7 points. I can honestly remember only one small piece of music from the entire movie. I am not complaining beyond the fact that the music could be more memorable.Ending - I give this component 9 points. Almost perfect ending! I feel that certain aspects of the ending should have been more pronounced, while others could have been more subdued, but no threads were left untied.Total: 93% Buy the DVD? HEL YES!

Great Movie!!,"I was not expecting much from this movie. I was given a ticket for an advanced screening. I had just gotten off of work. It was hot and I was tired. I had to wait in the movie line for 40 minutes and there seemed not to be any cool air flowing through the hallways of the theater complex.Once seated in the theater, tired and frustrated, the movie started, I did not recognize any of the actors in the beginning, but the flow of the movie was perfect. Right from the beginning I became consumed with the movie, getting more and more excited with each minute passing. I think this movie is destined to be a fantasy/fairytale classic.

Charmingly flawed; just don't expect the novel.,"Barring a largely inappropriate soundtrack, rather tedious tracking shots and some poor choices in CGI, this is the summer's most charming movie.And I do mean charming.

Claire Danes and Charlie Cox as the protagonists Yvaine and Tristan are entirely appropriately cast, and by the end of the movie you will fall pretty much in love. The rest of the cast perform admirably, with especial kudos to Robert Di Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer.Just don't expect the book. Vaughn has made some pretty drastic changes stylistically.

Stardust is an underrated humorous fairy tale of the summer movie season,"While I don't consider myself a big fan of fairy tale movies, Stardust intrigued me based on seeing Michelle Pfeiffer in the trailers as a villain (especially since I was about to see her as the bossy Velma Von Tussle in Hairspray). Boy, is she so convincingly evil here as a witch, especially with her age-ugly makeup in the beginning and end! Robert De Niro is also great as the pirate captain who's forced to hide ""in the closet"" to protect his ""reputation""! Just about all the actors like Claire Danes, Rupert Everett, Ricky Gervais, Peter O'Toole and many others do fine work here. While Danes and Pfeiffer are classic beauties, there's also stunning faces of Sienna Miller, Olivia Grant (as Girl Bernard), and Kate Magowan especially when we first meet her. Newcomer Charlie Cox is fine as the lead Tristan and he looked so much like his father Dunstan as a young man that I thought that was him in early scenes with Magowan (actually Ben Barnes). Many comments have compared this to The Princess Bride and while I can see some resemblances, the main difference was that with PB, you always knew it was just an imaginary tale as told by an old man to his grandson. Stardust makes you believe, for the most part, that what you're seeing and hearing could have actually happened even with all the hilarity that happens throughout. So on that note, I highly recommended Stardust.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A tale to remember,"What it takes to make a and to tell tale? To tell it with all passion you possess? What it takes, to create a story for children and their parents, without pompous moralistic lectures and banal cliché-like preachments? I guess, it requires sincerity, straight from you heart and soul. Sincerity, that can not be faked. And Stardust  is a perfect example of Tale from big ""T""-letter. It reminds literally brilliance of Astrid Lindgren, Tuwe Jansson or Alexander Milne. It has actor's sparkling performance (Peter O'Tool, Rober DeNiro Do I need to continue? ), astonishing special effects (a good tale requires magic, isn't it?) and kindness  kindness that nowadays lacks so bad. There were Never-ending Story. Now it's a Stardust. A good tale never dies, because hope is indeed immortal.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Truly amazing! A wonderful story.,"'Stardust' is truly a great movie. Oh, I absolutely loved it. Perhaps the plot was a bit thin, but that didn't bother me at all. Just a guy trying to find his way home, with a little mishaps on the way - but really, that is the plot in a lot of books and films.It was very cute, I think. It made me feel ... well, good inside. It was also very funny, very touching, very interesting, very ... good. I'm a bit hopeless at describing the movie today, but what I'm trying to say is, that this film is worth seeing. And worth seeing more than once.I saw it the day after it came out here in Denmark, and I think I will go see it again, sometime soon. Tickets to a movie cost a fortune here, but I liked it so much that my pockets have to empty a little, but for a good cause. Well, a good laugh, a good experience. I enjoyed it so very much. Actually, after I came home, I went straight to the library to borrow the book, it is based on. Perhaps I can relive the experience of this great story. I sure hope so. It was, and is, absolutely wonderful! Do go and see it. See it again, perhaps again ... and then again.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Lots of fun,I had not read the book and had heard mixed reviews of the film. Firstly I have to say that it isn't perfect and the ending was not great but generally the film was a lot of fun and I had a a smile on my face all the way through. The acting was fine with enjoyable performances from the princes and especially Robert De Niro and his men who were the funniest characters in the film (I wish the crew had more air time). Matthew Vaughn directs well but the cinematography is not nearly as interesting as in Layer Cake and occasionally the extreme wide shots overwhelm the film. The soundtrack is enjoyable and suits the tale though is quite forgettable. Overall a fun film though not quite in the league of the The Princess Bride,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Quality fun.,"To be honest, I didn't expect this movie to be as good as it turned out to be. No way this movie seemed like one deserving its current 8 out of 10 rating on here. This seemed to me like just another fluffy 'light'-Lord of the Rings children movie. But even though this movie borrows heavily from other movies, it remains a good and certainly fun quality production.Best choice the movie made, was that it was one that didn't took itself as seriously. You obviously have to take this movie with a grain of salt. It knows it is ridicules in parts and it doesn't try to hide this but rather even exploit it further. This is mostly what makes the movie so fun to watch. Because of this you also tend to forgive this movie from 'borrowing' elements or entire sequences from other movies. Fact that his movie doesn't take itself as serious can also be seen in the delicious over-the-top roles from Robert De Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer roles.Because the movie needs to be taken with a grain of salt, also the humor works out the best. The humor within this movie feels non-forced, even though it got put in- and planned out all deliberately into the movie. It knows to remain fresh and it doesn't overly try to make you laugh. It's often more subtle and not something you would expect from a genre movie such as this.It's mostly the fun level and atmosphere of this movie that makes it such a good one to watch. Because lets be fair, if this movie purely had to rely on its story, this would had been a rather weak and simple movie to watch. It's quite formulaic stuff all and of course the way the story progresses is rather predictable. I also don't know if this is really a kids movie. Even though the movie got obviously targeted towards this audience, I strongly feel that it are the adults who will mostly enjoy watching this. The humor and overall story is too mature for that.Also the diverse wide range of characters makes this movie a real fun one to watch. Most characters are really over-the-top and are often being played by some fine big name actors. Besides the earlier mentioned Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert De Niro, the movie also features Sienna Miller, Ian McKellen, Peter O'Toole, Mark Strong, Rupert Everett, Claire Danes, Nathaniel Parker, Dexter Fletcher and Ricky Gervais among others. Most of them are well known respected British actors, which also already gives the movie a certain atmosphere. But it needs to be said, with all the many different characters in the movie it at times feels that most actors looked as if they were making a movie on their own. The movie doesn't always feel like a coherent one.Also the pacing isn't always right and the movie gave the feeling that it also could had been easily 15 minutes shorter. It on the other hand is a fine looking and constructed movie, even though it doesn't feature the best special effects around but this sort of feels suiting for the movie and its entire atmosphere.Highly recommendable and in this case believe the hype!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Worthy unconventional fairy tale that should have been closer to the book,"Let's start by saying I loved the book by Neil Gaiman and recommended it often. Stardust was a very good fantasy movie in the vein of the Princess Bride with its whimsical tone and romantic aspects. Deniro was great fun in his pirate role that wasn't even in the book! As a matter of fact, all the actors were excellent. I wish that they had more fantastical creatures (like the book) and especially that they had not changed the ending of the book, it would have made it much more memorable. A few tweaks here and there, closer adherence to the original source material and it would have been a great classic for the ages. Tim Burton would have been perfect to direct this as I'm sure the original book would have appealed very much to his sensibilities. However, it was a worthy effort nevertheless. It's definitely worth a rental and a purchase if you like fantasy movies with romantic overtones.Rating: 7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great Fantasy Entertainment,"10 August 2007. Except for an awkward scene, this refreshing fairy tale fantasy has a fun and delightful undercurrent of adult cynical wit that charms its way into the audience as well as a soundtrack that powerfully moves this fairy epic along. Except for one of the Robert DeNiro scenes that doesn't come across smooth and appears out of sync with the tone of the rest of the movie, this luscious romantic fairy tail has a great storytelling feel and the strong magic and the fine balance between serious adventure scenes and the lighter spiritual humor is well done. In the updated tradition of THE PRINCESS BRIDE this contemporary presentation of magic and love is captivating. Eight out of Ten Stars.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stardust!,"Before watching this movie, I felt that it was not nice, the feeling of it that made me not want to watch. But I am glad that I did watch it and it is pretty cool. I thought it will talk a lot and it did prove me wrong. It cut pretty short on talking compared to other fantasy movies (where they talk a lot in the introduction) and goes straight to the intense action. It is safe to say that this can be one of the best fantasy movies or the best. Compared to The dark is rising, Stardust did a lot time better than it. Finally, a fantasy movie that don't disappoint. The recent fantasy flicks like Eragon and The dark is rising just fall flat to the ground. Surprisingly, Stardust got the right pace and end nicely.Stardust is good for all age not like Lord of the ring which has some violent scenes. Stardust has the humour to cheer people up but it does have its intense scenes too. It is a good fantasy movie unlike the recent ones. It won't disappoint you in terms of fantasy and plot. It is slightly weird and funny, it does have the intense action mixed with good intense music and has fantasy violence and things like the flying boat. What is more you want from a fantasy movie. The plot is surprisingly interesting too. It can keep you going. The recent fantasy movies do not have all these points. Stardust has a lot of reasons for you to watch.Overall, it did pretty good in the term of fantasy. It is a great movie to watch in the weekends or anytime. It does have the suspense to keep you watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A poor man's Princess Bride.  (A very, very poor man's Princess Bride.)","Stardust is an interesting mish-mash of things we've seen before, but it is not that interesting in and of itself.What it has going for it is:An offbeat sense of humour that makes it memorable even though it's not all that original. This will make sense to people familiar with Neil Gaiman's work, because he seems to take a lot of joy in odd little things. After seeing the movie, you just know the humour played out ten times better in the book, but at least they were *trying* to entertain us.A story with a beginning, a middle, and an end, even if it's all seemingly recycled. (That's more than you can say for Spider-Man 3, which never even really got off the ground.)Great performances from De Niro and Pfeiffer. Actually, the most noteworthy thing about Stardust is Michelle Pfeiffer's performance. It's so great to see her in movies again that one is led to believe that she is the actual ""star"" in this cast. I also happen to love Claire Danes, but I think the chemistry was off here. She could glow *without* any special effects, but I think she was just misdirected in this movie.What didn't work in Stardust:That same sense of humour that makes the story memorable is often just plain sad and unfunny.Stardust avoids ever having a point or hitting home on any of the moments that must have been good in the book. It makes you want to go read the book just to see how badly they messed it up. You can tell this was a sarcastic story in print, with a subtle mix of humour and romance. The movie never finds a balance; it just flops back and forth like a broken tennis ball... not very satisfying to watch.The special effects shots are pointless and uninspired. We've seen it all before, too many times. I find it hard to imagine that any of the kids in the audience were looking on in awe. I think most of them were just thinking ""get on with it"", like I was. If the filmmakers can't summon a sense of wonder, they shouldn't be making these types of movies.A weak plot. The main character is just getting pitched around from place to place. There are the elements of a story here, but without any flow. Most of the characters' growth is *implied*. This would be okay if the whole movie functioned as ""a story about a story"" like Princess Bride, but it doesn't. They actually try to be serious with this most of the time, and that makes it come off as very unsubstantial. I was moved once, and only once, by Michelle Pfeiffer's character near the end, and she was the *villain*.Stardust is a rental for a very boring night. Better yet, skip the movie altogether and sign out the book from the library.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of my favorite movies of all time,"Literally one of the best movies I've ever seen. Great characters, great story, great fantasy, and it doesn't take itself too seriously so there is some great comedy as well. Had me laughing out loud on multiple occasions. Most of the special effects even hold up in 2023. Not sure why the critic reviews aren't higher I think this is one of the greatest movies ever made and definitely Charlie Cox's best work of his career, he's great in daredevil but he was better in this. 10/10 would recommend to anyone looking for a movie that will entertain them from the first scene to the last and have them laughing throughout.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A future cult movie?,"Sometimes there is a movie that goes unheard of, ignored by most, sometimes pounded by negative critics and suddenly, some years later, it turns into a classic for some reason. Fantasy movies are usually on top of that list. Think of Labyrinth or The Dark Crystal. Stardust will probably find itself along with those titles in the upcoming years for many reasons.First of, the movie, overall, is not taken seriously in many different ways. The actors all seem to be having fun and an aura of global simplicity surrounds the movie from beginning to end. There's a lot of cheezy stuff in Stardust, but just enough so it can't be considered as a boring parody. It involves old fairy tales with contemporary humor, pretty much like Shrek did with brilliance. Although it is not funny as in laughable, the movie makes us smile not because of some joke or the facial expressions of some actor, but because we find each and every character charmingly naive and totally focused on one single idea. The fact that their personality is so simple makes them likable very soon after we encounter them for the first time.The most intriguing part is, without a doubt, Robert De Niro's role as cross dressing pirate. His part is played with great acting and he is seen just enough so his character doesn't turn into a cliché. He is an enlightenment to the movie and almost makes us forget about some boring scenes. The brothers killing each other for the throne also fill up some good moments. The main actor ( Charlie Cox ) playing the hero is doing his best but the whole scenario was too much of a "" loser turning into a winner "", he is still not experienced enough to play a leading role. He was mostly overshadowed by the other characters ( especially Lamia ( Pfeiffer ), Septimus ( Mark Strong ) and Captain Shakespeare ( De Niro )). Claire Danes was okay. I wished Jason Flemyng would've played a bigger part as Primus. I liked his over-the-top prince charming looks and personality compared to the Severus Snape/Aragorn look-a-like in Septimus who was not enough of a villain. Wearing black does not really make you evil. Michelle Pfeiffer was all right but I think her character also was built on ""evil looks"" and she is not that terrifying although the ""inn scene"" was great.These kind of movies must not be expected to be as gigantic and dramatic as The Lord of The Rings which is the prime example. It is not a work of art, just an enjoyable family friendly film. It has to be taken lightly. There is nothing out of the ordinary in Stardust but, sometimes, if we focus on the ordinary things we usually ignore, we find beauty in them and that is what can be found in this very movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Sweetly Funny, a Classic in the Making","As a massive fan of fantasy in general, and of the works of Neil Gaiman *in particular*, I've been looking forward to this film so avidly, so hungrily and with such a bittersweet mixture of anticipation and fear of disappointment that I can scarcely believe it's finally here. And you know what? I needn't have feared, the film version is bl**dy awesome. Different from the book, but in a good way - less whimsical, more comical, still deeply sweet and enchanting.The special effects are absolutely spot-on, and make magic feel a natural and proper part of the world of Wall without being overtly spectacular and intrusive.Proper attention has been paid to storytelling and pacing, and the casting in the main is a triumph, with the ghostly Princes (whose roll-call read almost as a ""Who's Who"" of currently cool British comedy - Rupert Everett, David Walliams of Little Britain fame, two of the blokes from Green Wing etc) stealing most of the best lines and pretty much all of the films' funniest moments, which exist in abundance.In fact, the one minor criticism I have at all of the film is that sometimes the comedy elements become a little OTT, subtlety goes out of the window to the detraction of the main story.... Ricky Gervais' cameo, for example, was far too much just ""Ricky Gervais doing his usual David Brent from the Office comedy persona"" for my liking, and in my opinion, created an unwelcome and jolting break from the magical spell of the progressing story (though in fairness, from memory I believe the Ferdy character in the original book WAS pretty ""Ricky Gervais""-esquire when I think back on it)....But this is a minor quibble in an otherwise immaculately cast and scripted fairytale with a good mixture of action and romance. Charlie Cox, as the protagonist Tristan, captures the correct mixture of naivety, subtle comedy and self-realisation required for a story like this where a ""humble young boy embarks on life-changing quest""; Claire Danes as Yvaine is beautiful, feisty and just ever so slightly alien or ethereal, a perfect interpretation of her stellar role; Robert De Niro, in the cameo every reviewer is talking about, is indeed deserving of praise, rollicking good fun (looks like he's having a ball, too)... and Michelle Pfeiffer is triumphantly cool and nasty as wicked witch Lamia, my favourite performance of the film overall. If you enjoyed her deliciously b!tchy performance in the recent ""Hairspray"" then you will thoroughly enjoy her in this, too.So to round off this review: you will laugh, for sure, you will smile, and you may even cry - Stardust is a beautiful, heart-warming fairytale for all the family, with a heart of gold and more sass 'n smarts than is immediately apparent. One of my all-time favourite films is the absolutely fantastic Princess Bride, and Stardust is being readily likened to this with good reason as it is a very similar type of film exploring similar themes and territory.... and just as The Princess Bride remains fresh, smart and funny twenty years after its initial release, I believe that the delicious tongue-in-cheek sweetness of Stardust will be showing up as a family favourite on our televisions (or equivalent future device!) for many years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A modern pantomime but without the wooden scenery or acting - 75%,"Having tried (and failed) to get my Better Half interested in the brilliant ""Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy, I was somewhat surprised that she wanted to see this so badly. A number of our work colleagues had recommended it which is normally enough for us to catch a bus into town and head for the cinema but having missed it, she wasn't about to let the DVD go the same way. Feeling very much like an English version of ""The Princess Bride"", it is a fantasy adventure with its tongue firmly in cheek but for those of us who prefer serious fantasy films, ""Stardust"" might not satisfy those die-hard fans missing Peter Jackson's genius.The film introduces us to Tristan (Charlie Cox), a young man living in the English village of Wall which, unknown to most, borders a magical world called Stormhold. Watching a falling star with the object of his affection Victoria (Sienna Miller), Tristan promises to bring the star back to her to prove his love for her and sets off into Stormhold to bring it back. But unknowingly for him, the star is actually a beautiful woman called Yvaine (Claire Danes) whose life is in mortal danger. Pursued by an evil witch (Michelle Pfeffier) and a villainous prince (Mark Strong), Tristan finds that achieving the impossible is really quite difficult.Essentially, that's the plot in a nutshell but what I neglected to mention is that the story allows for a seemingly endless list of cameos that nearly puts ""Ocean's 13"" to shame. Ricky Gervais, Peter O'Toole, Rupert Everett, Dexter Fletcher, Mark Williams, Adam Buxton, David Walliams - admittedly, not all of them are household names but this is one of those films where you'll recognise (or think you recognise) almost every character in the film. Sadly, the biggest cameo is also the most unusual and the biggest let-down - Robert De Niro as Captain Shakespeare didn't really feel part of the story at all and, personally, was a bit of a disappointment. But what makes ""Stardust"" work is that it covers all the bases for a decent family movie. It lacks the visceral brutality of ""Lord Of The Rings"" but makes up for it with plenty of comic touches such as the collection of ghosts commentating on proceedings. There are one or two moments to scare them as well but that's why we hide behind the sofa, isn't it?""Stardust"" isn't perfect - the whole thing feels disjointed like it's merely a collection of scenes with different characters. In essence, this is a million-dollar pantomime complete with stereotypical villains and plenty of broo-ha-ha and if that's what you're looking then you probably couldn't do better. However, I will hold my hands up and confess that I am a serious fan of fantasy. I don't go to conventions and I don't believe that early Eighties nonsense like ""Red Sonja"" are genre highlights. I just want a film that feels authentic and believable and in all honesty, the only films to do that are... you've guessed it, ""Lord Of The Rings"". A tad unfair, perhaps because ""Stardust"" plays the same game with different rules. This is a fantasy film for those who don't like fantasy, for those who haven't the time or patience to cope with more weightier material. This is a film, then, for my Better Half.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Magical and fantastical,"There are not many movies around that have given me a feeling like Stardust did all throughout the course of the film. As magically fairy-tale-like as The Princess Bride, Stardust is most definitely the most wonderful fantasy spectacle of the 2000's as well as the 1990's. Exciting, hilarious and equipped with wonderful imagery as well as unforgettable characters, Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiro's especially, I challenge anyone to watch this movie without a smile. From the first ten minutes of the film you know perfectly well how it will end, but it is the journey and not the destination that enthralls the viewer from start to finish.Ten stars, and not a decimal less.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Nice concoction with plenty of stars,"Michelle Pfeiffer as a sexy lethal witch with an aging problem is in better form than in ""Witches of Eastwick."" Robert DE Niro comes to the rescue out of the sky like the plumber in ""Brazil,"" in a sky ship just like the one from Disney's ""Treasure Planet."" Ian McKellen narrates, and come to think of it, the hero's (Charlie Cox') theme bears some resemblance to the Fellowship Theme in ""LOTR."" At least there are no R.O.U.S. in it!Despite uncountable derivative elements, and a high degree of predictability (c'mon, who did not think it will be Pfeiffer vs. Cox at the end with starlight saving the day, 15 minutes into the show?), this film manages to remain charming, well-directed, crammed with great actors doing their work exquisitely, and a deft script.The story is great fantasy. Tristan, a grocery boy whose father once stumbled over ""The Wall"" into a magical world right ""next to"" England, saves a fallen star incarnated as a beautiful girl. The star is pursued by witches who want her heart for everlasting life, and princes Secundus through Septimus who need her jewel to become king, but die like flies instead. The star gives her heart willingly to Tristan, aptly named after a German legendary prince: His mother is Una, the dying King's firstborn, whom his father had wooed during that one night over ""The Wall"" many years earlier.It is no ""Princess Bride"" however, a film that was starry-eyed where this one is just a little too glib and derivative. De Niro is great, but the drag show is a somewhat desperate attempt to be different. Having the evil witch give up, only to rise suddenly once more, is just like those all-too-expected endings of horror flicks where the dead monster pops up one last time for a gratuitous scare. Having the star profess her love to Tristan while he's hexed into a mouse, but then he confesses he understood everything is an old ""overheard monologue"" trick. At least he was a Rodent Of Usual Size. And yes, those notes from the LOTR ""Fellowship"" theme got a bit annoying after a while.Still, while the film is not great, it is very, very good: well-paced, with plenty of action, romance, comedy, scare, visuals, and fairy-tale. Matthew Vaughn is a versatile craftsman, having directed everything from crime thrillers to superhero flicks ... to this great little fantasy tale, worth seeing more than once.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

This is an wholly enjoyable romp, with an extra-ordinary cast.

Charming fantasy chase film but has an in-joke feel that feels incongruous therefore taints the appeal of the overall film,"I was lucky to see this at the cinema and I watched it again on telly as it was shown on Channel 4 this evening.Acting: Cox is likeably endearing as the naive protagonist Tristan, who goes through a transformation from boy to man. Danes is a good match as the understandably annoyed fallen star Yvaine as she has genuine chemistry with Tristan.Kelly is amusing as the guard of the wall to Stormhold. Magowan is alluring as Una. Pfeiffer is obviously relishing her theatrical type role as the witch Lamia, De Niro is OTT camp and unconvincing and and Miller's alright as Tristan's crush Victoria, if the role is underwritten. Gervais' annoying and unfunny shtick is anachronistic in a late eighteenth century world. Thankfully it's brief.Plot and Pacing: They've clearly gone for the in-joke feel of The Princess Bride here, which is a bizarre decision, seeing as this is a straightforward fairy tale whereas The Princess Bride is clearly a spoof.Not only is the tongue-in-cheek tone incongruous but it never truly feels like a true fantasy world for what I think is due to numerous references and locations.The plot is the standard chase film. The pacing is slightly off in the sense that we don't get a real sense of the passing of time, as Tristan has a limited period to bring the fallen star to his beloved Victoria.However, the film doesn't feel overlong as a whole. There are also a handful of laughs here and there.Cinematography and SFX: There's a lot of camera whooshing used to show different places in Wall and Stormhold and the CGI (mainly green screen) can look very obvious here. But, for the most part the SFX are fine, if nothing special. The general palette of the film is colourful and fitting.There's a lack of iconic location shots, though and some very LoTR looking scenes too.Score: The generic heroic soundtrack is used and it's sounds vaguely familiar(if you've seen fantasy films of the last decade, you know what cues and leitmotifs I mean). It's nothing new for this genre from composer Ilan Eshkeri.The standout easily is Take That's song Rule The World that plays in the end credits, capturing the warm romantic theme with aplomb.Overall: An entertaining romantic fantasy adventure that has charm and some good performances to help overlook it's lack of identity and inherent flaws. A good, if not great effort, mainly down to aforementioned unnecessary in-joke tone.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Delightful fantasy film!,"This film is lovely to look at, with lavish costumes and beautiful sets. The music is lovely too, with the beautiful Take That song over the end credits, and Ian McKellan lent his wonderfully distinguished voice to the narrator. Michelle Pfeiffer also is very good as Lamia, and Claire Danes is perfectly tolerable as the ""star"". I will say though that Charlie Cox was not entirely convincing at times as the hero, and the film is overlong. However, there are plenty of things to recommend it, particularly a chance to see Robert DeNiro in drag doing the can can. The direction, while not the best direction in existence, is competent, and does give some thrills here and there, like the princes who decide to kill each other. The script is quite witty, a little underdeveloped at times, but not that bad at all. In conclusion, an enjoyable film, not the best I've ever seen, but well worth watching. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Stardust"" has a good script, with many events taking place all the time and it is defended by a cast of respect. A fancy old fashioned necessary nowadays","In recent times, the fantasy genre has been represented by major productions, which eventually became the quality to be achieved by future productions. The Lord of the Rings trilogy by JRR Tolkien, the eight films adapted from the seven books in the Harry Potter series by British J. K. Rowling, plus adaptations of the franchise The Chronicles of Narnia by CS Lewis are the largest representatives of the genus by the technical quality and for introducing us always new worlds to explore. More recently we had other examples of the genre as Eragon (2006) directed by Stefen Fangmeier. Many of these works are from literary franchises, with open end and with very specific characteristics.The film is based on eponymous book written in 1997 by visionary author of novels and comics English Neil Gaiman and was designed by Charles Vess. Gaiman is the author of the Sandman comics and books like Coraline. Managing to stay true to the source material and resuming feature fantasy adventure '80s, Matthew Vaughn - formerly known for producing such films as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) Snatch (2000), Mean Machine (2001) and for directing Layer Cake (2004) - written with Jane Goldman and directed a fantasy exciting, full of danger, mystery and adventure with lots of magic, to please the whole family.Tristan Thorn (Charlie Cox) is the result of an adventure of his father Dunstan a slave to a witch when he crossed the walls of Wall and went to the city of Stormhold. When Tristan grows, the boy tries to win the love of the beautiful but cold Victoria (Sienna Miller) going in search of a falling star who has promised to give her within a week, preventing her marriage to Humphrey (Henry Cavill). His journey takes him to a mysterious and forbidden land, beyond the city walls. However, Tristan is not the only one behind the shooting. The four sons of the king of Stormhold (Peter O'Toole) and the spirits of his three sons are also deceased after her to retrieve an amulet that will give those who have control of the first reign, as the witch Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer ) who want to use it to rip your heart out and so regain her youth and her sisters. To meet all these competitors, Tristan need to win the love of the star, which turned into a girl named Yvaine (Claire Danes).Produced with about $ 65 million, the film suffered from poor marketing campaign and could not go so well at the box office worldwide. It's a shame, because if the name Neil Gaiman failed to attract the public, names like Robert De Niro, Michelle Pfeiffer, Claire Danes and Sienna Miller should have attracted more audience to theaters. Perhaps because it is a fantasy with all the ingredients of the tales begin with ""Once Upon a Time"" suggested to the viewer that the script was too childish. Of course it is a love story with the clichés of the genre. Want something more fanciful than a young man going after a star and offering it to your loved one? But this story works in Stardust, and much of this thanks to strong characters and engaging and many events that measure an agility enviable to the narrative. In the same magical world simultaneously follow a story with medieval kings and intrigue to the throne, a story of evil witches that are capable of anything to regain youth and have eternal life, beyond the fairytale offering of a star the maid. The shares will be well all intertwined and the various sub-plots are converging as the film nears climax.Speaking of characters, the two protagonists is very charismatic and conquer the viewer right away. Charlie Cox is the young Tristan, and can pass the physical transformation and feelings undergone by his character. The young man who starts innocent, insecure and that is mocked by Humphrey, learns in the course of the adventure to handle a sword and fight with the help of friends who make your way back to the town of Wall. He also discovers how spoiled is his beloved Victoria, and that true love can be right in front of us. Cox can prove naive, fearless and romantic whenever necessary. Nowhere seems exaggerated and their facial expressions are always consistent. Claire Danes is now the star who makes human form, Yvaine. Although very young Danes is already a veteran of TV and film. Winning actress Golden Globe for her performance in the TV series My So-Called Life (1994) and still win after the launch of Stardust in theaters, for their roles in the series Temple Grandin (2010) and Homeland (2011), Danes always stood by the undeniable beauty and have qualities of an actress sensitive, intelligent, able and show genuine emotions, and its versatility. At the beginning of the film she appears to be a bit exaggerated with their facial expressions and give the impression that I would be complaining the whole way, but at some point, still early in the film, she will falling in love with Tristan and Yvaine this will leave one likeable character , captivating and causes everyone to worship.The supporting cast assembled by Matthew Vaughn did not disappoint. After staying a few years away from the film, Michelle Pfeiffer came roaring back in 2007, having starred in the same year is Never Late For Love and Hairspray - In Search of Fame. How could it be, Pfeiffer is one of the highlights of the plot with his witch Lamia. Aided by a competent makeup job, she personifies the evil witch, ambitious, vain, jealous and self-centered as few. In certain scenes close, she really gets put fear.Interestingly, we can see a little humor in his personality, as vainly as she looks in the mirror where she lives with her sisters finding the witch most beautiful of all, and when she looks repulsed her appearance in the mirror of your vehicle more down the stretch. Robert De Niro proves that there are no small characters for a great actor. In the book his character is minor, but for having De Niro in the cast, their participation was expanded.But if we take into account that the film is over, its share is small, but it did not take much to prove their ability. His character is more comical and provokes laughter at times. Captain of a ship that rides on clouds, the captain who has a name of one of the greatest novelists of all time, Shakespeare, is reputed to be cruel and ruthless among his men, but when receiving Tristan and Yvone on his boat, which had just escaped from a trap Lamia, Shakespeare sees the chance to show a side more ""sensitive"" to act and think. Facial expressions and manner of speaking with your guests is hilarious and even unimaginable for admirers of Jake La Motta. Clearly, De Niro has fun with this job, is cutting hair, teaching dance or dancing in a costume not very suitable for a respected sea captain. He still knows fashion and on the mysteries of love. The scene where he is discovered dancing as well as his players supporting him shortly thereafter are among the best comedy scenes of recent times. Rounding out the cast, we still have cameos in the masters Ian McKellen as Narrator of the tale, and Peter O'Toole as the King, and the future Superman Henry Cavill as Humphrey, Rupert Everett as Secundus, Jason Flemyng as Primus . And always beautiful Sienna Miller as Victoria.The great success of Matthew Vaughn was betting mood. Almost all the characters have some point of humor. But the language more dense and gloomy Neil Gaiman is also present. We have many deaths, scares with witches and darkest scenarios, such as the castles and internal scenarios. Vaughn knows transit with these darker elements and scenarios sunny and starry nights as if from the pages of a real fairy tale. Another success was the long duration. Although apparently 127 minutes seem like much, its duration is less than the Harry Potter movies, for example. At that time, conseguesse develop and sub-plots without pace fall at any time. Throughout history, we have romantic scenes, sword fights, magic spells and mood. The script is also tied tightly, so that, in the end, it converges to the final climax so exciting. Vaughn and Jane Goldman have left the film became full of sword fights, leaving it with style over male action. The story structure and interaction of the characters was very well built and developed.Important to mention the quick edit Jon Harris who can accelerate the key moments in film for the great photography Ben Davis knew construct two worlds, as the worlds of history. One is more poetic, as the world of Stormhold is darker and more dangerous. Highlights also include the scenes that take place in the ship's Captain Shakespeare and scenarios where was the witch Lamia. The costumes and art direction also has an impeccable job in building this magical world. Some commented that they did not like either of the effects, but they are great. Especially for a budget not so great, the effects are powerful and compelling, as well as makeup.Stardust is a movie for fun family eat. Inspired by classic '80s as Ladyhawke and The Neverending Story, the film even seems slightly shifted in time and perhaps it has not made a resounding success at the box office worldwide, but the result we have here is extremely satisfactory.

Fantastic adaptation of another magical Neil Gaiman story. Yes, there are differences, most notably, the ending, but it was a fairly quiet finish to the boo, in a movie it needs to be bigger. A few things are missing, the little hairy man who helps Tristran, the fight between the Unicorn and the Lion, but these weren't necessary and at the end of the day they're still in the book for you to revisit.

One of the most wonderful movie if not the best.,"The most underrated movie of out times. 
It has the fantasy, it has the villains, but most of all it has the element which makes it the most beautiful of all, the things which makes us human.
Robert De Niro is wonderful in his role, one of his exemplary performances, loved it.
Just watch it when you need a pick me up in life.
we all need a little stardust in our life.
Thank you for making this movie.

7.9? Makes me loose faith in IMDb,"7.9 ?????!! Are you kidding me? I turned this off half way through... Corny and Campy. Unoriginal and cliché. Not one interesting character. Maybe if your below the age of 10 you might enjoy this one. What a bore fest and a joke of a movie... NOT for adults or any person above the age of 10. Furthermore, how the hell is this rated 7.9??? It blows my mind! Even as a kids movie it sucks, the story is long boring and not intriguing. Every person I was watching it with agreed to turn it off, and there were 3 girls. I would hate this as an 8 year old and I hated it now as a 23 year old who is enrolled at film school at UofI. 7.9?? Come on IMDb voters.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The ending is very satisfying (read: predictable), but the movie Stardust is not out here trying to surprise you with huge plot twists.

lovely,"a joy to discover it. because it is more than a fairytale adaptation but field for beautiful acting, smart script, joy and irony and a Robert de Niro from old times. a film who serves the book in a splendid manner because, more than any other virtue, it is alive. the adventures, the love story, the fight against the evil, the different levels of events, the poetry of photography are real, seductive and, maybe, a delight. a film for a special age, more to remind memories than for the children. because it use the entire magic of the novel in wise style. and that is a more than good point - it is a lovely surprise. trip in strange universe, it is inspired tool for remember the importance of small details who defines the life.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

Fabulous fun-filled fantasy!,"Once upon a time - not too long ago - there was a magical movie which enchanted young and old alike. It was filled with magic and wonder, wizards and witches, and a kingdom looking for a new ruler.Such a movie was 'Stardust' - a new generation fun-filled action adventure comedy fantasy. The film is loaded with adventure and interesting characters. But above all, it is about love. Yup, that age-old movie premise. The love story is maybe a bit unconventional, but nevertheless a love story - and actually a beautiful love story at that!Claire Danes unfortunately wasn't all that believable as the star - uhm, I mean star, as in falling star. In fact, she over-acted quite a bit in the beginning and was more than just a bit annoying. However, as the film progressed, she and her character grew on me. Likewise, the humor was a bit slapstick in the beginning, but also improved as the film went along - especially once Captain Shakespeare (Robert de Niro) made his appearance. He was by far the most interesting character, fabulously played by De Niro. I loved this character! They also cleverly used this character to convey an underlying message.There's lots to enjoy here. The adventure element alone with its great cinematography was awesome. There's also a good score and fantastic make-up and visual effects. The film's final act has a significantly darker tone and the finale is excellent with stunning effects.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Even better than an amazing book,"Amazing cast, amazing soundtrack! As other reviewers have said I'm bemused as to why this film didn't have more publicity, had more glowing reviews, etc. but then again based on films like Baron Munchausen and Princess Bride that also didn't receive great reviews I suppose I shouldn't be surprised.
This is an amazing film, Neil Gaiman is an amazing author and I would definitely recommend reading the book. I feel embarrassed having to say that the actors are all amazing (just look at who are in this!!!) . It's really impressive that they are all in this film pick one of the known actors and they are iconic. Shooting locations are great as well if you're in the UK have a look where they are and visit them if they are near they really are as pretty as in the film.

"STARDUST (Matthew Vaughn, 2007) ***","I was only vaguely aware of the film when it came out but became interested in catching up with it after being bowled over by Vaughn's KICK-ASS (ditto for his debut LAYER CAKE [2004], which I have just rented). In retrospect, it is one of the best fairy-tales of recent memory – though it does not quite possess the vision of a Tim Burton.The director in any case has managed to rope in a great, eclectic cast: the ladies seem especially well-chosen – though both Claire Danes and Michelle Pfeiffer are clearly past their prime, they still deliver as a fallen star assuming human form and a wizened sorceress seeking to restore her beauty; the others are LAYER CAKE's Sienna Miller as the obligatory snobbish town belle and Kate Magowen as a bewitched princess. Incidentally, Vaughn apparently likes to work with the same people – such as the afore-mentioned Miller and Mark Strong (though now becoming rather typecast in villainous roles). His siblings-turned-ghosts include Rupert Everett and Jason Flemyng (Calibos from CLASH OF THE TITANS [2010]); actually, it was sheer coincidence that I would watch this right after that one and ROBIN HOOD (2010), in which Strong appears as well, having rented the STARDUST DVD for the best part of a month! Robert De Niro is featured in one of his most bizarre characterizations as a literally gay pirate, though it is one of the film's ultimate drawbacks – exposing a certain lack of cohesion – that his entire subplot could be dropped without the narrative losing anything (as it is, at 128 minutes, this definitely feels overlong though never boring). Peter O'Toole turns up briefly, too, at the start as a dying sovereign.Having a wimp bloom into manhood through a series of extraordinary adventures also seems to be a prime concern for director Vaughn; consequently, here, bland hero Charlie Cox is involved in many a scrape – peppered with laughs, thrills, romance and menace – capped by a doozy of a climax (which even sees a corpse contracting a' la the EVIL DEAD movies). The whole makes for a most enjoyable ride, one which I consider worthy of a cult following.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Stardust charmed me,"This charming little story completely missed the marketing wagon and I feel drawn to point it out to people so it gets the attention it should. I found it in the cheap pile at a DVD store on the weekend and decided to watch it late on a Sunday night. I'm really glad I did. It's been a long time since a fantasy movie has told a fairytale so completely and so well. Most of the cast were brilliant; it seemed everyone was having fun but taking it seriously, producing a happy, dreamy quality with dark undertones that all good fairy tales should have. Ricky Gervais was the exception (although it may have been because I don't like his humour); he seemed to not fit into the world they were trying to portray. Michelle Pfieffer was a perfect wicked witch, Charlie Cox was a great lead role for a virtually unknown actor, and even Claire Danes had her moments. The whole film was fun, feel-good entertainment without being either Disney or Epic Fantasy, with good use of limited but perfect special effects. There's an absolutely fascinating fight scene that you have to see to believe. The film reminded me of the good old days of Labyrinth, Princess Bride and Never Ending Story and was a only a little disappointing by being very same-ish throughout, no huge highs or lows, with very little in the way of memorable quotes (except for a rousing pirate ""Argh!""). That's the only thing I can be critical about however and I will be recommending it to everybody I see in the next few weeks.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A good looking film, but wasted in it's bland story.","This was a gorgeous looking film but there was no payoff. Now I love Robert De Niro, but him acting as a fruit was not only not funny, it was plain embarrassing and totally out of place. I realize he is probably trying new roles, but this was plain terrible. I thought the acting was also very good, but the overall script was the same thing I've seen hundred times, but done better. I think children will like all the fireworks and good special effects, but people that have seen lots of better films will just find this film to be blah. There is absolutely nothing standout about this film. I've missed Michelle Pfieffer and it was good to see her back in films, but I think she was wasted trying to do the best she could with what the script gave her. Which was absent, and would have been that much worse of a film with a lesser actress. Don't waste your time or your money, when you can see the performers in other better films.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
a fantasy adaption that works !,"After my huge disappointment with ""Golden Compass"" I spontaneously decided to give this one a try. I didn't get disappointed. Though ""Stardust"" only takes two hours it makes excellent use of every second. Great storytelling (also thanks to the novel by Gaiman), well done cinematography, effective music, good acting and the long breath you need to tell fantasy like this.In my point of view especially the first hour was a fabulous experience. In comparison to ""Golden Compass"" I think that ""Stardust"" director Matthew Vaughn did right what Chris Weitz did wrong. Though ""Stardust"" works with typical and familiar fable schemes it feels fresh. The story never shies away from making unconventional use of these schemes.In a short: so for those who wonder how good fantasy might look like on the big screen 2007 I'd just say: here you go ! Good piece of cinema !",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Films Aren't Made Like This Anymore,"Is it weird that the one thing that really sticks out about Stardust is that one of the small subplots involves Daredevil and Superman getting into an argument? Well, I guess that's not entirely the case, but a young Charlie Cox and Henry Cavill essentially fighting each other probably would have been more than enough to please me. Stardust is far more than a simple love story or fairy tale, it's irreverent and oozing with genre fun. Oh and you also have an extraordinarily gifted cast across the board.Films aren't really made like this anymore. It's so hard to come by a big budgeted/genre film with a lighthearted tone and with this type of humor. You could see it on TV, or perhaps in the 1980's, but good fantasy films are so disappointingly rare these days. The closest could perhaps be something like the Kingsman movies (which Matthew Vaughn also directed), but even those could just be labeled as success due to comic-book background.But the pure fantasy adventure is surely something cinema's could use a little bit more of these days. If movies can get actors like Robert De Niro to do some of the ridiculous things he does in this movie, then I think we have a winning formula. But in all seriousness, Charlie Cox, Claire Danes, Michele Pfeiffer, Henry Cavill, De Niro, and Sienna Miller make for a fantastic ensemble cast of witches, Kings, a star (?), and one special prince to make for a thrilling adventure.7.6/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A fun fantasy movie.,"""What do stars do? They shine.""Sky pirates. Blood-thirsty (actually, heart-hungry) witches. Fallen stars. Murderous princes. Action, humor, and all the romance that anyone should require. Stardust is an entertaining fantasy adventure film that has it all, and should appease any fan of the genre.Matthew Vaughn's second directorial effort is quite different from the work he did before and after it (the excellent Layer Cake and Kick-Ass, respectively), and it proves that he can make a good movie in nearly any genre. This adaptation of the Neil Gaiman novel of the same name follows our young hero Tristan (Charlie Cox) as he follows a falling star to another world, in order to bring it back as a gift for the woman he wants to marry.It's not that simple of course, as Tristan finds the star to be not a mere celestial rock, but a young woman (Claire Danes). A very uncooperative young woman, and one who is also being sought by three witch sisters and a prince, who all wish to kill her for her immortal heart. As you can probably guess, that scenario has adventure written all over it.Stardust has a very definite Princess Bride vibe. If that movie's mix of action, humor, romance, and colorful characters (Robert De Niro has a ball as a rather unique pirate, and Michelle Pfeiffer and Ricky Gervais also steal every scene they're in) appealed to you, then you're in luck. I honestly can't come up with many reasons why someone wouldn't like this, unless you're just not a fan of Gaiman's book or the genre as a whole. I found it to be charming and fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Breezy!,"A fantasy comedy romance more in line with ' The princess bride' ,juggling dark humor with a children's story.Stardust is a delightful and entertaining romp. It has a lot of elements and a lot of disparate parts but the director succeeds in bringing everything together coherently. There is an ample sprinkling of humor that ranges from a chuckle to laugh out loud. Keeps the story from getting stale. The way the movie bucks our expectation in certain scenes is where it shines.Loved the acting. Charlie Cox, Mark Strong Claire Danes and Michelle Pfieffer are all amazing. But it's really my man,De Niro that steals the show. Haven't seen him in any role like this. He was by far the best part of the movie.While it does buck our expectations in some places. It's apparant as the movie goes on that the overarching plot will be familiar. It's disheartening to see that things will end up the way you would expect. The special effects as well haven't quite aged well. I doubt they were adequate when the movie was released.Good movie overall.

"""Nothing says romance like the gift of a kidnapped injured woman""","... Is a line of dialog you will not soon forget. As an added bonus it is delivered by Clare Danes no less, some years before she became a TV icon in Homeland (and some years after she first became a TV icon in My So Called Life) So lets not mince words. The golden era of film fantasy was the period 1930s to 1940s (see my review for example of LA BELLE ET LA BETE) and some efforts since then have been hit or miss.This is a hit. It is earnest and unpretentious and simply tells the story.It is tons of fun.There is also a scene where Michelle Pheiffer transforms from an old hag to ... I think ... herself.

As magical as childhood,"The beautiful story of Stardust is written by by Neil Gaiman (writer of MirrorMask) and it's really a good story. I think it would appeal to any Labyrinth, Princess Bride or 10th Kingdom fan and yet it's totally unique and stands up on it's own. And I feel the film adaptation of this story has a far better ending than what was presented in the original novel by Neil Gaiman. I won't spoil it for you.The main character, Tristan (Tristran in the novel), is the son of a mortal and a faerie slave kept by a witch in the realm of faerie. The story begins in a town near a wall that separates the magical world from the human world. When there is a falling star Tristan promises to retrieve it for a girl he is infatuated with. He is unaware that the star has taken the form of a girl in the fairy world and that there are others after her too. Three elderly witches who want to use her heart to become young again, and some bickering princes.It's a really good story. It has humor and magic and beautiful, surreal scenes and visuals. It's charming and I feel it can be watched by children and adults of all ages. It's simply magical. It's a true classic fairy tale, the likes of which I haven't seen in cinema since the 1980s.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Original story, lame presentation","Movies must be difficult to make. I think this is true because, given an original story, a decent cast of likable characters, and a book to work from, this movie still fails in most regards. While the dialogue, even the humor and ""wit"", was fairly weak and seemed like the writer was trying too hard, it was the actual shooting that hurt the film.Camera angles, lighting, timing of cuts, length of a scene, music, continuity...the film seemed like it was directed by an amateur film maker. The scenes were (mostly) the bare minimum to get the point across - very little dramatic work, and in a fairy tale type romance movie, you want something dramatic, epic.This film drew early comparisons to the Princess Bride. Stardust is a romantic fantasy with a crazy cast of characters, fencing, fighting, pirates, witches, true love. But the writing and the scene-crafting in the Princess Bride were works of art, and Stardust seems a little too raw -- overblown sarcasm when subtle wit was needed, or the camera focused too briefly on an amusing look by a ghost.Again, kudos for, finally, an original fantasy story hitting the theatres (instead of sequel upon sequel) and it was a good one. I can imagine the book was much better though.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Earth to Director: Stick with Directing,"I had a longer thing here, but ultimately this movie isn't worth that many words. It can be summed up in just a few, actually: Matthew Vaughn, longtime producer, directed the movie ""Layer Cake."" Nice debut.For some reason, afterwards, he decided he was a screenwriter too. He isn't.His screen writing partner is someone with no writing to her credit, and according to the IMDb seems to be little more than a TV personality. Their screenplay is awful, trite, simplistic and condescending, but you can still see the starlight of a brilliant book (which I have not read) shining through.The actors mostly bring their A-game. Claire Danes is passable, but isn't a star (either within or outside the movie), and has a horrible British accent. Robert Deniro doesn't even attempt an accent, so at least he's playing to his strengths (sort of). Name actors are given very little to do, and no-name actors are given huge parts to play. The results are mixed.I did enjoy the movie while I was watching it, but afterwards I had time to ask questions. Questions like ""why the heck was there only one guard on the wall 24-hours a day? didn't he have back-up?"" or, ""Why the heck did they cast three younger actresses to play the old witches, and only one (Michelle Pfeiffer) is ever seen as herself? Why not just cast 2 older actresses and save on the wrinkled latex?"" It's incredibly sloppy construction, but Vaughn wanted to add to his audition reel, I guess, and hung his fancy suburban home (er, flat) on the blueprints of a Beverly Hills mansion. This is a C-minus movie that should have been an A+.Just because you can direct a film does not mean you can write a screenplay. See also ""Spider-Man 3."" In the case of ""Stardust,"" I heard the book was phenomenal, and the Neil Gaiman I've read defies description.This movie doesn't. It's just pretty okay.

I think that Stardust will go down as a classic in the future. I will not give it away but if you haven't seen it yet, Robert DeNiro gives his best surprise performance of his career. Forget his classics, this role will forever go down in history, or at least my history, as his best role ever!!!

It Ain't The Princess Bride,"Having met and spoken to Mr. Gaiman about his writings and, specifically, about this film, I had extremely high hopes for it. For those not ""in-the-know,"" Neil Gaiman is the author of the novel STARDUST, as well as many other award-winning stories.There's been a bit of buzz about comparisons between Stardust and THE PRINCESS BRIDE. And although I can see a few points, Stardust is really its own animal. This is both good and bad. The good comes from the fact that it's original and almost epic in scale. The bad is that it strikes a few funny chords only to reign itself back into serious territory where much of its umpf! is lost. The Princess Bride played off its ridiculous nature so well that you knew nothing was to be taken too seriously. It never went for the serious angle (much to watchers' delight). But Stardust loses quite a bit of its power by jumping back and forth, as well as having a beginning that lagged.If you're looking for an honest retelling of Gaiman's Stardust novel, please don't go and see this. Just as if you enjoyed Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep by Philip K. Dick, I wouldn't expect that you'd go see BLADE RUNNER and applaud its accuracy to the novel. That is to say that both mediums have their good points, just try not to compare them too closely.What we have here is a smidgin of Neil Gaiman's story taken out and revamped for movie audiences. And this is a good thing. Trying to be too strict to a novel's plot can stymie creativity when it comes to film time. Thankfully writer/director Matthew Vaughn realized this.Although there are peeks into Gaiman's story, most of it is Hollywoodized to appeal to a larger audience. The mysterious town of Wall, the beauty of Star/Yvaine, the evilness that appears when sudden beauty arrives, etc. These are nice incorporations. Where it fell down a bit is the overly long opening which was used to describe the goings-on around Wall, the addition of certain characters/parts in order to add the ""blockbuster"" talent (which wasn't all bad), and the on-again off-again seriousness that went a bit too far.The biggest letdown for me was the main protagonist Tristan (Charlie Cox, CASANOVA). His role wasn't the most inspiring. Unfortunately neither was the beautiful Star/Yvaine (Claire Danes, THE FAMILY STONE). She played just well enough to keep me watching her, but that was about it. The supporting cast held my attention MUCH better. The wily old man who guards the entrance/exit to Wall (David Kelly, CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY), the wickedly wicked witches  especially Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) who plays the part so over-the-top as to be delicious  and how could we forget Captain Shakespeare (Robert DeNiro, THE GOOD SHEPHERD), the flamboyant captain of a sky-ship who captures lightning like fish and keeps his cross-dressing secrets securely hidden in his closet. These supporting characters are what kept me engaged and they weren't what the story was about.Comparisons aside, this is an okay film to check out, but don't let anyone fool you. This isn't The Princess Bride II.For a better Gaiman adaption, try checking out MIRRORMASK.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sentimental fairytale with genuine magic,"Stardust is the rare modern film that harkens back to the classics whilst creating some magic of its own. Early proof that Matthew Vaughn is more than capable of handling family friendly fare with grace, even if it has a surprisingly high body count and memorable kills. It's a fairytale in every sense of the word, warm, whimsical and completely unafraid to be completely sincere.The film moves quite quickly so Charlie Cox and Claire Danes having an adorable chemistry really helps to sell the fast developing relationship. Cox also does a good job of turning Tristan into a more capable hero whilst losing none of his innocence and Danes brings so much warmth and personality to a character who is essentially a living macguffin.Michelle Pfeiffer is clearly having a ball as a thoroughly irredeemable villain who enjoys being evil as much as Pfeiffer does playing the character. Mark Strong proves he should be given way more comedies by completely committing to the bit and Robert DeNiro going completely against type as camp pirate captain is the textbook definition of a scene stealer.Matthew Vaughn's direction has a lot of energy to it and ensures that the overall warmth is strong enough to overcome any less than stellar visual effects. The music by Ilan Eshkeri is a constant delight and the song by Take That is just as sentimental as the film itself. It's one of those rare songs that transcends its source but works even better when paired with it.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stardust escapes the galactic vacuum,"This movie would have worked so much better if they had left out the 21st century dialogue and mindset. The 21st century is great for special effects which was almost excellent. But when a movie takes place in another period, please leave out lines like ""This is the part where you tell me..."". De Niro can say that all he wants when he plays a cop or bad guy, but why waste great acting on really bad dialogue? Unfortunately, the writing often seemed cheap and non-relevant.What saved the movie was good special effects and the presence of Michelle Pfeiffer, De Niro and Claire Danes along with some very good performances by side-kicks and lesser-knowns.Throughout much of the movie, you have to accept ""changes in the rules"" like it were some game that was played by rules which could be changed at anytime(especially at the end). It's like watching a Superman movie where you know what powers he has and you wonder what he will do to get out of a mess. In this movie, disaster can be avoided by simply having a writer toss in a ""Scooby-Doo"" type explanation to appease the audience rather than enveloping the audience in beauty, awe and mystery. In this case, when beauty and mystery made itself obvious, writing all too often drew the viewer away from its comfort zone by tossing it into a kiddy carnival atmosphere.I accepted the fact that the writing was not geared to the more mature audience. I also accepted the fact that the movie was not quite what it could have been. I think it is safe to compare this movie to Haunted Mansion. It started out good but cheap comedy changed a good story into something that didn't have a ghost of a chance at being a huge hit.I gave it a 7 out of 10 because most of the time, I had hope it might get better.

The throwaway characters, the seven ghosts lurking in the background who served no purpose, other than to provide an unfunny lame running commentary throughout or the supposedly 'funny' scenes. I think that it is probably the terribly predictable ending which annoyed me the most. The only redeeming features of this movie are the beautiful scenery, and as usual, the great performances by Michelle Pfeiffer & Robert DeNiro. The film dragged on for an unnecessary 128 minutes, and failed to hold my interest. It really is a painfully average film, that by no stretch of the imagination, deserves to be hailed a 'classic'. It is certainly not a film, that in 20 years, people will still be talking about, which in my book, is what I consider a classic to be.Stardust : 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A fine movie,"The movie is what you can expect after listening to its plot. I watched this movie and i must say it's a really good one . It takes u all the way from commitments,comedy,adventure,fun and of course romance..This movie has got a good humor.I really appreciate the acting of Robert Deniro and the guy Charlie Cox along with Claire Danes and all the others who have put a nice job !! I loved the acting of Charlie Cox and also his getup .. It impressed me quite a bit. The locations shown are also awesome.

"Good movie...not a must-see, but a fantasy-love story","This is a good movie...on the first run. We watched it a friend's house in High Definition. The picture quality is superb, spectacular at best. To put it in terms of a high school perspective, this movie takes the cliché fantasy love-goochy goochy theme and puts it into an epic, ""Lords of the Rings"" type of setting, where there are 2 worlds (don't recall the names of the 2 realms). One world is the magical world. The other is the human, non-magical realm. The movie takes place in the magical world. There are some bitter, (inane) witches. They duke it out with the 7 sons of a king who is about to die. These 7 sons must kill each other to take the realm of the king, but first they must capture this ""special"" pendant. The pendant is actually a special gem that takes the form of a beautiful, shining, ""star"" woman, who runs into the main character. No, I can't remember any names, but that's the basic lowdown.BUT WAIT! There's more! The good part of this movie is, it's exciting! I was on the edge of my seat for a good 20 minutes (not continually). And as a friend puts it, there is an ""anticlimax"" at the end- something you didn't expect to happen. At least to us. So you should go see this movie, in HD if you can. The picture quality is amazing. The plot isn't unique, but the actors make it so.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A VERY pleasant surprise of the summer,"I had no real expectation about this film going in, but I was SO PLEASANTLY SURPRISED by what I found. It was charming, amusing, inventive, and told a wonderful story. I fell under its spell, so to speak.The film had a slight ""The Princess Bride"" vibe (though nothing, in my view, will EVER hold a candle to that masterpiece), but this was just an enjoyable ride the whole way through.I could have done without Michelle Pfeiffer's over-acting and pathetic attempt to play a ""witch"" - but aside from that, the acting was great and the characters were enjoyable. Robert DeNiro's character was pretty amusing, in particular. Loved the ending too. A great choice for any age or gender - it's got something for everyone.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Notch Above Your Average Fantasy Movie,"Old Pirate: (to Captain Shakespeare, after finding him in drag) We always knew you were a whoopsie...Usually I hate these types of 'fantasy' movies. With the exception of the brilliant 'Lord of the Rings Trilogy' and the charming 'Princess Bride', these fairy tale movies can't hold my interest. Going into 'Stardust' I didn't know what to expect. I thought it could be great, but it could also be a huge, long, stupid bore like most films in the same genre. Well...what I got was a very good film, nothing spectacular, but in a year like 2007 where most of the movies are laughably bad, 'Stardust' is one of the best thus far. The story is silly and doesn't make 100% of sense, but for the most part aside from a few dragging sequences 'Stardust' is a vastly entertaining motion picture with humorous performances. Michelle Pfeiffer returns to the screen after a hiatus of sorts as the film's villain. She is great. Charlie Cox is solid as the lead, as is Claire Danes. The rest of the cast is solid, but I'd like to give kudos to The Office's Ricky Gervasis and of course, 2-Time Academy Award Winner Robert DeNiro playing against type as a gay cross-dressing sky pirate. Even though he doesn't show up until over half of the film is over, DeNiro was the highlight of 'Stardust' for me. Some critics panned his performance as being too hammy and over-the-top, but seeing as though 'Stardust' is a ""FANTASY"" movie, I saw the more hammy the better. DeNiro made me laugh uproariously, along with most everyone else in the movie theater I was in. The biggest downfall of 'Stardust' is that it's overlong. It would have been a better film if they trimmed a few minutes especially towards the end. All in all, I recommend 'Stardust' for anybody in the mood for an enjoyable little action romp.

A fun movie with stellar acting and a couple of really entertaining scenes,"Just a quick disclaimer; I'm fully aware that, being a 23 y old guy, I don't belong under the ""targeted audience"" group and my review/rating would probably be better if I was younger. The only major issue I have with this movie is that after the first 10-15 minutes, I pretty much knew what was going to happen throughout and at the end of this movie. When a movie is predictable and too transparent it really hinders my ability to enjoy the movie entirely. If I was younger this probably wouldn't be the case and I would rate it much higher.Now then, that being said.. I do have to say that I still did enjoy the movie as it was really fun and exciting at times. It's by no means a spectacular piece of work, but it's decent nevertheless. The cast was great and they really did the characters justice. The story was, as I said, quite predictable, but enjoyable nevertheless. The scenes with Robert De Niro were hilarious, same goes for Ricky Gervais. The flow of the movie felt really smooth and it didn't really get boring at any point, which is a major plus.Overall, a decent movie that's well worth the watch. It's entertaining and fun! Like I said, I'd rate it higher than 7/10 if I didn't have such a problem with predictable plots.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Wonderful, well paced escapism","This is beautifully cast, wonderfully made, a delight to watch. I felt that all the participants enjoyed themselves as much as I did as a viewer, from villains to heroes to comic cameos. I had heard mixed reviews, but was ready to suspend belief.I had not realised how well the humour would be crafted. Some of the characters were predictable while others stood out as a remarkable surprise. In particular I enjoyed Robert de Nero; far more of a surprise than I had anticipated. I think I will enjoy watching this again, a comment I can rarely make with certainty.I should have guessed that Neil Gaiman would have created such a wonderful world.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Finally... a fun fantasy film,"Maybe it's because it wasn't written by Hollywood, but by a real author. Maybe it's the tongue-in-cheek fun, from a camp Robert de Niro to the dead princes. Maybe it's just the refreshing originality of having a star (the kind in the sky, not celebrities) being a girl. In any case, Stardust is actually the first modern fantasy film which is very good. It really is not cheesy or wooden or predictable. Actually it is somewhat predictable as all fantasy films have to be - the boy and girl get together, and good wins against evil, etc. The best aspect was the ghosts of the dead princes - I loved their comic role here. The worst aspect... probably the Take That song at the end. But you don't have to stay for the credits so go and immerse yourself in it.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Lighthearted, pleasant for an early night","This is a very lighthearted film. Pleasant for an early weeknight.The characters were all charming, and I liked that it had all the fine elements of a good myth: metaphorical characters with a neatly wrapped up ending. I especially enjoyed the goat-man. Very funny, not unlike Peter Pettigrew of Harry Potter without the eeriness.The chorus of ghosts is a pleasant device that balances out several gruesome on screen deaths. In fact, their banter was very funny. Pushes the appropriate age limit up a bit -- young kids might be disturbed by the killing.Plenty of silly laughs come from seeing characters like De Niro and Ricky Gervais out of character. Their haggling scene is one of the funniest, snappiest pieces of acting that I've seen. Gives Monty Python in the Life of Brian a run for its money.In fantasy tales it can become annoying when magical characters run amok without any real parameters, casting spells at whim or manipulating the elements. I usually find such stories to be the result of lazy writing. Stardust pushes the limits in this respect, but manages to stave off total absurdity.Sit back, relax and enjoy the show.--dejiridoo",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Missing something....,"The previews of this movie had us waiting with baited breath. But, alas, it failed to bring forth a single endearing character until the final few minutes. Visually entertaining, with a great idea -- ghosts, witches, flying pirate ships...all enticed us to buy tickets. From the poor opening week gross, it is evident some other people were wiser than we. When Robert Di Nero is not convincing one points at the writer, director or both. The hero is weak and does not inspire an empathy from the viewer...also he is pretty stupid not to be amazed that an actual star is a beautiful girl. Michelle Pfeiffer's character steals the show, otherwise it would have been a complete waste of time.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Out of the ordinary,"This is one of those rare occasions where everybody has taken a risk - and it has paid off well (although it is obvious there was a budget to stick to).

You get it both ways.,"In Stardust, you get it both ways: Michele Pfeiffer as a several hundred years old witch and Michele Pfeiffer as a stunningly-youthful 49 years or so of her real face but still a witch. This fantasy-fiction adaptation has a similar bipolarity: The romance of Tristan (Charlie Cox) and Yvaine (Claire Danes) in a strangely magical kingdom just beyond the town Wall's wall is part naïve Princess Bride, part degenerate Pirates of the Caribbean, and a modicum of Lady in the Water.(Tristan has made a promise to his love that he'll catch a falling star by venturing over the wall into the kingdom.)Mind you, I enjoyed the childlike part and the raunchy in equal measure with a unicorn and a man turned mouse on one side and a pirate in drag on the other (Robert De Niro as Shakespeare). I'm just not sure who besides me as man/boy will be attracted to this layered fairy tale. The computer graphics are not the most stunning of the year (a positive condition for those of us surfeited with CGI)), the flying ship hardly realistic, but Michele Pfeiffer's aging body does show some sophisticated effects.Supporting the bipolar air of Stardust is Claire Danes in the titular role (Yvaine is a star landing on earth in the form of an attractive young woman). Danes is an off beauty with a unique smile allowing her to emphasize the ironic with some sardonic turns. Danes just seems too intelligent and is too old (She is the most mature looking and acting 28 year old in Hollywood) to be playing against immature 25 year old Charlie Fox.Yet all the inconsistencies work because the film is essentially intelligent and relatively unadorned. It is interested in the choices young people make (Tristan's initial pursuit of a selfish girlfriend is not suited to him; Shakespeare is bluff and tortured about his cross dressing).So let the pixie dust or stardust or whatever shine on you and enjoy a shower of impressions not always logical but usually delightful. Things are not always as they appear.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good fairy tales don't come along everyday,"""Stardust"" really seems like one of those well-machined fantasies that checks off all of the genre tropes: witches, curses, falling stars, enchantment, a valiant hero, pirates . . . And the earnest romance weaves all of this into a nice package. Michelle Pfeiffer plays the hell out of her sorceress role and steals this show, while De Niro offers himself up as a transvestite buccaneer, and the cast is rounded out by beautiful women. It's a little unwieldy and the running feels long after a while, but stick with it and the movie rewards on a true love level alone.Plus, it's a Neil Gaiman story.Win.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Stardust Melody,"My stardust melody, The memory of love's refrain.Stardust, Lyrics by Mitchell Parish, Music by Hoagy CarmichaelNo, this is not about Stardust, the song, but Stardust, the movie. I have implicitly criticized movies based on comic strips, then modified that somewhat saying that we would be seeing Stardust after all, when I realized that a ""graphic novel"" could be much more than a simple comic strip. This film is far better than that, and far better than I had imagined.Imagination is the key word. The film is the best new one I've seen in a theater in months, and definitely the most imaginative one I've seen in years. Yes, large parts of it are derivative, but being derived from something else is not important. It is what the film maker does with those that determines the worth of the film. That the director/writer Matthew Vaughn and co-writer Jane Goldman have accomplished gloriously.What is the film? It is funny, romantic and adventurous. It has a classic quest plot line, with as unlikely a collection of characters not merely than one could imagine (that word again), but would scarcely ever dream of imagining. The hero (Charlie Cox  totally unknown to me) morphs from a teen-age jerk into a romance novel hero (your typical handsome prince, in my wife's phrase). Most attention has been given to Robert De Niro's way-over-the-top performance, and well it should be. It was the only aspect of the film about which I harbored a reservation prior to seeing it, a reservation which turned out to be totally unjustified. De Niro, in a relatively brief appearance, is incredible! And his famous scene (think of John Hurt as Caligula in I Claudius) is absolutely integral to the plot (which I am not about to give away).But it is Michelle Pfeiffer as an ugly old witch (now there's casting against type for you!) who really chews up the scenery, especially at the end. The movie has villains galore, and did I mention humor? It has plenty of one-liners for the adults. My own favorite was the punch line that followed ""A two-headed dog? I could get that for you."" I'm not giving that one away either.Beyond any possible argument, the star of the film is the relatively little known Claire Danes. She plays a strong woman who is also vulnerable, totally human while simultaneously being much more than human. As made up for the movie, she is not conventionally pretty, but she has a magnetic inner beauty and gives a luminescent, shining performance that makes her the most unforgettable person in the film.Who is the film aimed at? Well, not young children  too much violence (even if cartoonish) and probably a bit too much very-off-screen implied sex. And it is not aimed at anyone for whom the magic of movies no longer holds any attraction, or sadly never did.Stardust has not yet received either the acclaim or the audience it so richly merits. But it is, both figuratively and literally a gem. As I was watching it, I was mentally rating it at a very strong 9. But by the end, it was a clear 10. I recommend it most highly.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Surprisingly GREAT!,"I chose the title off the shelf of my video club just because--and I honestly confess--I saw the names of Robert De Niro, Michelle Pfeiffer and Clare Danes. Not with much confidence (and expecting a total disappointment like the latest Disney's ""Enchanted"", which I thought was AWFUL), I started watching it and I was almost instantly THRILLED, EXCITED, totally and completely SURPRISED and AMAZED. Glued to the screen. I devoured the story and I delayed returning the video just to show it to my family and to myself have the opportunity to watch it again. We all thought it was the best film we'd seen in a very, very loooooooong time!!! The acting is just perfect: all the irony, puns and attitudes are what they are supposed to be. I liked the portrayal of all the different characters: sincere, believable and funny. And, above all, I'm absolutely amazed at the solid storyline: the plot does not have a single flaw, and it is refreshing to watch such a film, logical in its own laws, well developed, well portrayed, excelling in visual development (not only the CGI, but all the landscapes.... all the scenes, actually, are worthy of belonging to a painting in a museum). The romance has the perfect ingredients to make anyone -and I really mean anyone of any age!!!-- fall in love with the film.

I enjoyed it more than the book,"I tried reading this fairy story by Neil Gaiman last year, but gave up after a few dozen pages (there's a limit to how much I can suspend disbelief), but it translates well to a movie, which rushes along without giving you much time to think about it. I have to admit I was impressed. The story is ridiculous of course, but the visuals are OK to good and the acting is excellent (especially Claire Danes as the constantly complaining fallen star) - the cast all seemed to throw themselves into it with enthusiasm. It's a tad long at just over two hours, considering that it's targeted at children, so you may be wise splitting it into two showings if you get the DVD.

"Wit and charm win out in ""Stardust""","Sometimes in cinema, being clever and silly can hide a movie's obvious flaws, or at least make you forget about them. ""Stardust"" fits right into that category with its colorful cast of characters and witty little British sense of humor. This is not a fantasy film of ""Lord of the Rings"" proportions and it doesn't try to be (except for an overabundance of transition scenes laden with grandiose music), instead coming more out of ""The Princess Bride"" vein, only with not as talented acting and not as well-developed characters. Basically, it's enough to wet a fantasy lover's whistle, providing just over two hours of engaging, swashbuckling entertainment.""Stardust"" is classic fantasy plot, delivered to us by well-known fantasy writer Neil Gaman. A boy living in a re-imagined England that is surrounded by fantasy lands is infatuated with a girl and promises her a piece of a fallen shooting star as his commitment to her, only to find an unfathomable adventure waiting for him as he sets out to find it. In fact, he finds stars are actually people and this one is a young woman (Claire Danes) with a bit of an attitude. After this fantasy world is established with a few side plots, one including Michelle Pfiefer as a witch seeking the star to restore her youth, the plot becomes rather predictable.The dialogue, to be honest, is atrocious in most of this film. The comedic scenes work better, but the ones where the film actually takes the plot seriously are no good and the acting doesn't help out. As much as Pfieffer looks the part, she's not much of an actress, coming across as a laughable villain. Claire Danes gets better as the film progresses, but she just feels like a poor woman's Gwenyth Paltrow and nothing more. Stealing the show, however, in his limited opportunity to do so, is easily Robert DeNiro as a lightning-harvesting sky pirate named Cpt. Shakespeare to whom there is more than meets the eye. He is fantastic and comes at a critical point to save this film from being plain old boring. There are a few other great cameos as well thrown in the mix to cover the otherwise unmemorable acting and half- developed characters.While ""Stardust"" bounces in and out of being a film that takes itself seriously as an adventure flick and one that tries to be silly and completely not serious, the overall tone that encompasses both is still plain old ""fun."" Fun doesn't have to be well-executed or perfectly scripted, it just has to make you smile and forget about that kind of stuff that would normally matter in a serious movie-going experience. In that sense, all the kudos to Matthew Vaughn and this giddy little project of his. If only it had gotten better advertising.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The proof of life still in the genre of fantasy,"I'm particular about movies depending on the very mood that I exhibit at any given time, but this film caught me completely off guard in its capability for both originality and level of surprise.After The Lord of the Rings, I thought that perhaps all we had to look forward to in the fantasy genre was for the Harry Potter series to finish its run. I'd seen several attempts of new efforts here and there that simply failed to captivate me.What held me from the very start was the well-spoken narration by Ian McKellen. From there on it just became more and more charming to behold with each set and character introduction. The whimsy was light and delightful.There were the archetypes of old, but they were merely touched upon, not hammered upon in great detail. The story was very complicated, yet simple in concept. I thought that the beauty of the story telling was that everyone knew what actually should happen to the main character which was a direct contradiction to his main goal.I thought it was remarkable that the story held no restraint in eliminating characters. It was quite brutal yet understandable.The film, to me, was all about true beauty of soul. So many characters were absolutely remarkable for their own inner radiance. The quality of them helped to turn the tale in surprising new directions that really kept the pace exciting.The ending surprised me above all things most.

The best film of 2007 by a mile!,"Having looked forward to this film for months, when it was eventually released in the UK I was disappointed to read a review labelling it as mediocre, boring, poorly scripted and a big let down. Having been so excited about the film, I went to see it against the reviewers advice. I remember thinking as I walked out at the end that this was quite possibly the most enjoyable film I had seen in a theatre since Casino Royale in 2006. The story, a fairytale at the core was incredibly uplifting and in comparison to my usual taste in movies, this was a major high point. Normally I go for action films or thrillers, although I'll give anything a go once and this is the first family oriented movie that I have seen in the cinema for a long time. I liked how Tristan was played by Charlie Cox, an actor who is relatively unknown and he did an outstanding job. Claire Danes was on top form as Yvaine and Michelle Pfeiffer proves that she still has it too, whilst De Niro destroys his tough man reputation in a hilarious role that he plays to perfection. If you don't enjoy Stardust, you cannot possibly have a heart, Schwarzenegger and Stallone are amongst my movie heroes and in a year filled with disappointing sequels and over hyped blockbusters, I found Stardust shone like a beacon.

Whimsical as intended. Read the book after!,"I adore the book, I love Neil Gaiman, and I like fantasy movies. This should be an obvious win, but it's a mixed review. Stardust is sweet, but deviates from the book in important and annoying ways.Stardust is a classic fairy tale. Tristan Thorne ventures off into the fairy kingdom of Stormhold to retrieve a fallen star for a young lady he wishes to marry. But of course, the world of fairies differs greatly from our own. The star is not a lump of rock, but a surly girl, and her entrance into Stormhold has not gone unnoticed. Powerful princes and witches race to seek the Star's power, and Tristan is thrown unknowingly into the pitch for power.If you have not read the book, I highly recommend it, particularly if you can get your hands on a copy with the original illustrations of Charles Vess.The movie stands on its own without comparisons to other current popular fantasy movies. Beyond the eye candy, the story is solid and the characters are quirky and interesting. The three competitors for The Star cross paths in entertaining and coincidental ways, and the movie - like the book - is wrought with comedy.While the movie is mostly faithful to the book, the biggest downfall is in the minor characters. Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiro both had their parts artificially inflated for the movie. Robert DeNiro's pirate captain Shakespeare, in particular, was a role that took place in about 3 pages of the book. It's true that a long passage of time occurred in those few pages, and it was nice to see them fleshed out in the movie. But the character of Shakespeare was reduced to Jar-Jar Binks status - mostly unnecessary and over-ridiculously funny. Pfeiffer as the Witch Queen Lamia had a role much more in keeping with the book, and stole the show with her deliciously evil performance. But the added combat scenes at the end were over the top, and eventually made no sense at all. A huge ""huhwhut?"" washed over everyone in the theatre - book fans and newcomers alike - when Lamia's part ended. Even Septimus had his character altered from unyielding villain to sympathetic opportunist.The best part of this movie is the romance. While foppish Tristan could have been a slightly more remarkable man, Claire Daines was perfect as the surly Star, and paired together, they were too cute to deny. The image of Yvaine shining every time she's happy is practically meant for movies, and will strike a heartstring-chord for anyone who's ever been in love. There are even a few places where the story is altered to add some subtle lines that build the romance, and they're very effective.Because the story is so packed with adventure, and a few things were inflated to fit the big acting names, the movie is a little long.

However, you won't find Peter Pan or Tinker Bell in this fantasy adventure, rather, an original set of characters in a truly magical world.When young Tristan Thorne promises the girl of his dreams the moon and the stars, he sets off on a fantasy quest literally reaching for the stars. Caught between malevolent witchcraft and greedy heirs to a mythological kingdom, his adventures take him on a perilous journey through air, land and sea arriving at an enlightened conclusion that true love can never be bought; no matter what the price.Penned by graphic comic novelist Neil Gaiman, this is a fantastic tale set between pre-modern England and the netherworld. On screen, it's a film filled with action, suspense, romance and comedy and goes on to breathe life back into a genre that hasn't enjoyed much significance since ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Even so, while ""The Lord of the Rings"" is mainly an intense battle between good and evil, Stardust appeals to a wider audience for its atmospheric plot, flamboyant acting, exhilarating score and surreal cinematography and is a refreshing change given its originality. Acting is just stellar thanks to an ensemble cast starting with an initially unrecognizable Michelle Pfeiffer as an evil and conniving witch and Tristan's main adversary. Her first brush with magic may have been in ""The Witches of Eastwick"", but given here role here, her character is both ugly and cinematically flawless. Excuse the pun, but Pfeiffer fans will be most certainly zapped! Claire Danes also gives in a commendable act as a fallen star turned fragile mortal. If her role is meant to symbolize the frailty of purity and innocence surrounded by greed born of evil, then she does so with all that we have grown to expect form her. Opposite Danes is newcomer Charlie Cox in the lead as the blindly infatuated Tristan. For one of his first major film roles, Cox delivers unexpectedly with a performance equal only to Orlando Bloom's rookie days as an up and coming actor.Perhaps the most surprising and stand performance in the entire movie comes from Robert De Niro as Captain Shakespeare, a mean swashbuckling pirate on the outside, with an embarrassing secret on the inside. In my opinion, De Niro almost single-handedly steals the show despite his limited screen time, not because he is one of my favorite actors, but solely due to his hilarious antics behind closed doors. Now if you are accustomed to De Niro's Mafioso demeanor complemented by his signature repetitive dialogs, then like me, prepare to laugh your head off. And trust me, you won't see it coming either, so avoid the built-in DVD/Blu-ray trailers. Rounding off the cast are some memorable contributions from Mark Strong, Nathaniel Parker, Sienna Miller and a cameo from Peter O'Toole.Co-written and directed by Mathew Vaughn, this is a film not to be missed especially if you liked his previous work in ""Layer Cake"" and ""Snatch"". Special effects though seldom, do create a visual impact when used and is punctuated at the right moments. Even so, blink and you might miss some of the best moments. If you haven't done so already, this is the perfect film if you have been considering an upgrade from DVD to Blu-ray.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Very Slow Development,"This film was ultimately enjoyable, but it took the first half of disjointed stuff to arrive into a smooth movement.Robert De Niro definitely saved the movie as his character developed and nailed substance to this otherwise mis-directed film.I will rent the film on DVD and cut and paste De Niro into a twenty minute enjoyment as an artistic remake of an otherwise long filmThe De Niro character erased any other of the actor's attempt to get an Oscar.In essence, a boring film was vaulted into a classic gay movie.

Fantastic Film Not to be missed.,"I have just seen this Movie for the first time and I am kicking myself that I didn't watch this sooner because it was Brilliant.The Story is great there are just so many things going on at once that the film never gets boring because sometimes with films even great films have some parts where you start to lose interest but this kept me glued to the screen.First of all the film was hilarious The Ghost Brothers really had me cracking up and Robert De Niro doing the cancan was the funniest thing I have seen in ages.The Cast was phenomenal as well. Charlie Cox did a great job as the lead character and I am surprised that I have never seen him in anything else its as if he has disappeared which is odd because he does a great job.I think I have fallen in love with Claire Danes she looked so beautiful and her acting was perfect especially in the scene with the mouse.Michelle Pfeiffer was a great Villain she really stole the show her performance was flawless.Mark Strong gave a good performance as Septimus because the film needed another Villain as well as the Witch, his Character was interesting and Mark Strong always does good as a bad guy.My one small problem with the film was the fact they underused some great Characters Robert De Niro was not in the film enough he didn't appear until nearly one hour in and his characters was only in the film for twenty minutes. He was the funniest characters in the film and should have had more screen time it seemed a waste of De Niro's talents.Look out for some great cameos by Ricky Gervais who steals every scene he appears in, and Peter O Toole puts in a good performance as the King of Stromhold.I Loved the film though and was really shocked to find that it did poor at the Box Office. A part of me wants a Sequel because it would be interesting to see the Characters again but I have a feeling that a Sequel could be poor because the Story would have to be Original not like this one which was based off a book.Overall Stardust is a great film for all the Family which mixes Action Adventure Comedy Drama Fantasy Romance and Horror.Rating 9/10",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The pieces are more enjoyable than the whole,"""Stardust"" is from a story by Neil Gaiman and it shows a lot of the imagination and weirdness you'd expect from this author. It also has an amazing cast as well as a one of a kind story.The story is about a star that has become human. Two groups are trying to capture her, as if they rip out the woman's heart, they will supposedly live forever. Three are nasty and powerful witches and seven are psychotic brothers who want to live and rule for eternity. Out to stop them is a young man who doesn't realize who he really is nor the power her or the star-woman possess.The story didn't excite me as much as it did many of the reviewers. I found it too busy and confusing. But what I loved about the film are the wonderful supporting characters and the weird sense of humor--such as a cross-dressing pirate and some wonderful ghosts. Well worth seeing and a film that probably will appeal more to teens and women...though I still liked it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stardust captured my heart,"I was really looking forward to the film, and I was certainly NOT disappointed. I thought it was enchanting, and clever, not to mention the comic relief was wonderful. In a lot of films people wonder ""where is this heading?"", or they simply fall asleep. This kept my father awake and intrigued.. which is a miracle for HIM! Going to my favorites' list. Loved it. If you're down, and you want to dream again or be inspired, this is your kind of fairytale.I thought the acting was also done extremely well, and although many fairy tales are alike, this story is original and fresh. I give it nine out of ten stars.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stardust: Passable but thats about it,"Written by Jane Goldman and with a plethora of established stars such as Claire Danes, Robert DeNiro, Michelle Pfeiffer, Ricky Gervais & Mark Strong this UK/US made film is quite nostalgic.What I mean by that is its a fantasy tale that reminds me a great deal of many from the 80's/90's. From Willow to Ladyhawke this has that vibe to it and is a very charming film.Family aimed though dark in places it tells a highly convoluted story that manages to entertain but certainly doesn't meet its potential.Magic, sword fights, flying pirate ships, ghosts, betrayal and love. Everything you could possibly expect from such a movie.The comedy is lacking but the cheesiness is overflowing, thankfully the great cast make the most of it and it comes out the other side watchable.Maybe I'm not the demographic, but this mega budget effort felt like it should have been a grand epic but wound up like a feature length pilot for a television series.I commend Danes on her performance, this is an actress I usually don't see the appeal of but she was excellent here. The rest of the cast including a huge variety of British comedians also do a great job, but I expected more.The Good:Danes & DeNiroSweet taleThe Bad:Lackluster in placesI'm supposed to root for a kidnapper?Take That for the credits, really!Few annoying unanswered questionsThings I Learnt From This Movie:Blueblood is meant literallyRobert DeNiro in a dress is a memory that takes gallons of alcohol to eraseMark Strong looks weird with hair",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A sweet film that reminds us that fairy tales can still exist in Hollywood,"From the moment the narration begins you immediately realize that this is the beginning of a wondrous ""fairytale."" A delightful story about Tristan, a young man who vows to prove his devotion and love for a woman he has always believed to be the one, embarks on a magnificent journey to find a falling star and return it home. An endearing yet unique film that created a world that literally existed beyond the realms of an ordinary wall; a place full of witches, magical curses, flying ships that capture lightening, and love found in the most unlikely of places, it gave audiences more than the typical Hollywood film that we had grown accustomed to seeing. With a superb cast led by Mark Strong, Michelle Pfeiffer, Claire Danes, Charlie Cox, Robert De Niro and a list that surprisingly goes on and with a beautiful score that compliments every scene, Stardust is truly a sum of its parts; a film that recaptured our imagination and fantasies and reminded us of those rare ""happily ever afters.""",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fairy tale theater,"A young guy in in love with a girl. And the girl, not being in love with him but with herself instead, wants proof of his love. So he sets out to bring her a fallen star. Little does he know that the star landed in a world that is very little like his own, but he'll found that out soon enough.Once in a blue moon a new fairy tale is born and as it grows up it might one day find its way to general public. In this case, the fairy tale did. It grew larger, it grew tangled roots and eventually it rooted itself in full completion on a cinema screen, shining brightly as the stars it tells about.There must be three or four fairy tale films on yearly basis. Some work, some don't. This one is a slight bit on the plus side of the middle for me. The story is worked out well enough but I think there's just too many bland pieces in it to make it really brilliant. Adding a whole plethora of famous actors to the film usually means the film is supposed to be bad, but in this case it more or less works out. I loved Robert De Niros part in this one. That one worked out really well.7 out of 10 fallen stars",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fun fantasy action movie.,"Liked the movie very much; has a bit of a slow start but once the action starts it's very enjoyable. Lots of action, great special effects and it's got some humor as well. If you like fantasy movies you'll enjoy this one. My hubby wasn't a big fan but our 11 year old daughter loved it as did her 16 year old cousin. Great for kids although some scenes might be a little scary for younger children. Robert DeNiro is great although the role is not quite what I'm use to seeing him in and Michelle Pffeifer is great as well.

Entertaining and Diverting but a Classic it is Not,"Lively Fantasy Film for All Ages is Mostly Amusing, Heavy on the CGI (no surprise) and Sports a Pretty Good Cast to Wander Among its Wonders.

The Action is Bland but the Romance and Fantasy Parts Hold the Thing Together Enough to Bring it Home.Overall, About Average or Slightly Above for the Genre, Worth a Watch, and Probably will Remain So Over the Years, but it is Hardly a Classic and Falls From Being Anything too Special.

Quirky Romantic Fantasy,"""Stardust"" is the most enjoyable movie I've seen in years. I like the fact that it's hard to categorize. I'd call it a romantic-comedy-fantasy-adventure. There is exciting action. There is a fairly standard romance. There aren't any belly laughs, but plenty of good chuckles.I noticed several years ago while watching ""The World According To Garp"" with my family, that it makes a great difference who you watch a movie with. The first time I saw that movie was with a theater full of possibly inebriated college students. It was great fun. With my family, parents, sister etc., it was almost bad because they weren't into it at all. I saw ""Stardust"" with my wife. I think the hand holding and snuggling during the movie added a lot to the enjoyment. If you can, see it with someone you love. I think you can enjoy it alone or with friends, but it's better with a significant other.There are a lot a familiar faces on this movie. I found that somewhat distracting. Captain Shakespeare was the only character I found to seem somewhat unreal. I think I detected De Niro ""acting"".The visual effects seemed natural. Sure it's a fantasy, but the filmmakers didn't make the mistake of overpowering the story with flashy effects. The characters are believable. While most of them live in a fantastical, magical world, they still behave as real people would in those circumstances. Except for De Niro I didn't notice any ""acting"".Bring a date - Enjoy!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"An awful, awful unintelligent movie","I have never seen such a stupid movie in my life. Just like many recent movies captured a large audience by incorporating many levels of understanding and humor (for children and adults), this movie misses both by situating itself precisely at the half-level in between. What I mean is, that this movie is not exactly appropriate for children, yet the subtlety of the dialogs, the depth of its characters and the meaning of the story would not even satisfy an intelligent 12 year old. With all its special effects and all, the extreme corny-ness and false depth of the script made me want to hide under my seat, especially during the most idiotic dialogs. If at least the movie was short, but NO they had to make it long and painful. I can't believe I wasted so much time seeing this amazingly useless movie.

Imagination to the point of overkill...and beyond!,"This is one of those rare modern properties that seems stuffed to bursting with good ideas. It also seems well able to carry off most of it's high flying whimsies. However, about half way through the film I began to notice a slight air of overcrowding and desperation. It was as if the enormous cast of very loud and very busy characters were tying themselves up in knots trying NOT to fall over each other. It seems a shame that the idea of the homicidal Princes who are forced to hang around after death waiting to see which of them ends up as king ends up competing for screen time with the rather more pedestrian nasty witches who seem to have been rather clumsily lifted from ""Hocus Pocus"". Perhaps these two factions might have somehow dovetailed together better without the LONG and far from convincing ""Deniro as A NELLIE Pirate"" nonsense...( couldn't ""out"" stars Rupert Everett or Ian McKellan take a second to tell SOMEBODY...ANYBODY how unfunny this was...or what a fool Bobbie D. was making of himself? As a gay man....I would gladly have given a little hint about it's being tasteless AND terribly done. I might have put it down to rather innocent insensitivity if the author of the original story hadn't used the word ""Fairies"" quite so blithely in an interview on the DVD).All in all...there is a moderately appealing 95 minute movie buried in here somewhere...with several sharp and funny performances. Unfortunately the film is SO busy hopping around from plot thread to plot thread that NONE of the characters are ever fully developed...or given much chance to really shine...(which is a shame...because Danes seemed always on the verge of really beginning to glow).A near miss...which deserved better than it's paltry box office take...Better luck next time all around.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A simple fairytale-style fantasy film done exceptionally well.,"Somehow a fair few of films that I really enjoy have had some part of their advertising which made me expect the worst of them. The original Shrek was one of these, with the images of goofy characters grinning stupidly at me from each and every poster there was no way on earth that I was going to see such a film. However when my sister brought it home on video and played it over and over again I was gradually sucked into it, drawn by it's satirical humour and great characters.This is another film that I did not find particularly appealing from the advertising. The pictures I had seen made it look similar to the poorly done ""Eragon"" and the trailers hinted at a dull, hackneyed story-line, so I approached this film with low expectations.It turns out that the story of the film (which I won't delve into) *is* relatively simple and uses plenty of well established fantasy ideas, but this doesn't detract from it in the least. It feels complete with no irritatingly blatant attempts to leave room for a sequel. I know that this is adapted from a book, but have not read it, so can not comment on how closely it sticks to the original. However it comes across as a fairy-tale of the type you are read when you are young, done in the epic style (see LotR and what Eragon was trying to be) which is generally associated with the fantasy genre. In no way is this forced, and the clean simplicity and predictability of the storyline mean that the wit of the production is lost on few without seeming pointlessly trivial. The setting is beautifully rendered with interesting characters who develop nicely (if predictably) and works well as a continuation of the genre which LotR proved to be financially feasible.The music is a mixture of LotR and PotC 3 in style, with hints of Harry Potter. Occasionally it is over the top, though, when the dramatic context did not require it to such an extent. That is one of my few problems with this film. Despite this the majority of the music is compelling, engaging and fitting to the style of the rest of the production. It also utilises some well-known classical music, applied to humerus effect. (I bought the sound track, it's that good.)One other problem I had was with the casting of Ricky Gervais. This is purely a personal problem which not everyone will agree with as I do not find his style of comedy particularly amusing, rather the opposite in fact. However this was mitigated by the small amount of screen time and what happens to the character. Otherwise the casting was sound, each played their part to near perfection. I absolutely loved the witches, often finding myself cackling along with them. Michelle Pfeiffer was perfect as the leading witch (she had a title, but I forget it).Overall a wonderfully rendered fairy-tale style film with few flaws with an epic score that will draw you into it's world and leave you with a sense of deep satisfaction and warmth.Hooray for decently made fantasy films!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
book was better,"i loved the book, and i wish the movie had been more true to the book.i thought claire danes and nathaniel parker did fine as the leads. unlike some other posters, i liked the chemistry between them. and sienna miller and henry cavill nailed the shallow arrogance of victoria and humphrey.i guess my main disappointment is that the movie came out as a light-horror film, something like pirates of the caribbean. then of course, maybe the 20 minutes on the pirate ship vs 15 seconds on the succession to the throne might have contributed to my impression. the horror sequences with the princes and witches seemed to go on forever. and the uplifting themes, like the willingness of the hero and the star to sacrifice for the other were de-emphasized. so i'm guessing it's the editing that feels wrong.the tone of the book was noble and romantic, focusing on heroism, personal growth and true love. the movie felt more like indiana jones light.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"""Stardust"" Has Magic","""Stardust"" gets off to a slow start but about halfway through it gets significantly better.It starts out with lead characters that are whiny and not very likable.

Her evil witch is hilarious. Robert De Niro gives one of his funniest performances ever as a pirate.Overall, ""Stardust"" is better than the majority of sequels out this summer. If you are willing to overlook the flaws of the first half, you are likely to have a good time. It gives you everything you could want from a fantasy film. It has kings, princes, a princess, pirates, and a cannibalistic witch. It might be too dark for children, but adults will surely like it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Not ""The Princess Bride,"" But Then Few Fantasy Films Are","Fantasy adventure is a genre I very much enjoy, and it's a genre too neglected by Hollywood. ""Stardust"" is a fun and enjoyable addition to it, even if it won't go down as the cult classic it so obviously wants to be.The film's biggest flaw is that there's simply too much going on, too many plot strands, and the film itself is too long. You can feel it working overtime to create the same kind of whimsy that infused a movie that IS a cult classic, ""The Princess Bride."" But that movie was small, charming and simple. It didn't stuff itself to the brim with digital effects and thunderous action the way ""Stardust"" does, and the latter film doesn't come close to the former. But I did appreciate the humour in ""Stardust"" and its refusal to take itself seriously. Charlie Cox and Claire Danes are likable enough as an impetuous English lad and the fallen star he falls in love with, respectively. Michelle Pfeiffer looks gorgeous (at least at first) as a witch intent on regaining her former beauty, even if she's not at home with the film's comic elements. Unfortunately, Robert De Niro is miscast as a swishy pirate with a penchant for corsets and boas, and his big comic scene just feels uncomfortable. But Ricky Gervais adds some fine comedy in a couple of brief scenes, and Peter O'Toole lends the whole thing some credentials by virtue of his mere presence.Even if it has its faults, I liked ""Stardust"" and hope to see more films like it.Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Solid entertainment,"This film is about a young man embarking an adventure through a fantasy world, fighting against cold blooded princes and evil witches.""Stardust"" has an imaginative and relatively complicated storyline. Fortunately it is well told, so it is easy to understand. The progression of Yvaine and Tristan is convincing. I like the imaginative and well decorated sets, and the costumes are also nice. The ideas of dead princes appearing in black and white is funny, it gives a lighter atmosphere to the otherwise tight action sequence. It is interesting that Michelle Pfeiffer chooses to do another evil character after her role in Hairspray. It is also interesting to see that all the actors use the British accent in the film, despite the mostly American cast.

The best movie of 2007,"Brilliant cinematography, great dialogue and excellent acting make this movie the best of 2007 hands down! This is really a movie with something for everyone and must not be missed.

It has genuine comedy, action, drama and fantasy that will not disappoint and a superb musical score that completes it. Even if you absolutely hate romantic movies, you will love this because it is much much more than just a romance movie.From the opening scene, with an accomplished narrator introducing us to the spectacle about to unfold, you know you're in for a treat but I remained a little skeptical for the first 10 minutes thinking that there was no way the movie could carry on in such a brilliant and entertaining way.. I assumed it would get a little boring after a while, after all it is over 2 hours long. How wrong I was! There was not one moment in the movie that lost my attention and to me that means it was close to perfect! I rated this movie 10/10 because it did everything it was supposed to do, and did it very very well. I think its so good that at the time of writing this, on IMDb.com the rating is 8.1 and that is a slightly unfair rating!

Mildly entertaining,"Stardust is the story of Tristan Thorn, a young man who sets off on a journey to a land of magic and adventure to bring back a fallen star as a token of his love to the girl he wishes to marry. On the contrary to his expectations, the star isn't just a lump of rock, but a vibrant young girl, who reluctantly has to follow Tristan back to his home village, while she's also hunted by an evil witch, who needs the star to restore her youth, and a number of power-hungry princes, battling each other for the throne of their kingdom.Based on a novel by Neil Gaiman, Stardust is an adventurous fantasy movie slightly unlike other recent films of the same genre. It draws its inspiration from English folklore, which gives it a fresh touch and original enough a setting. However, the movie fails to capture the spirit of the book that was originally Neil Gaiman's take on classic fairy tales - fairy tales as they were before they were sanitized by Perrault, eventually Disney. It's an honest fairy tale for adults, following the classic pattern of the coming-of-age story of a young man through a quest, without the sugar-coating seen in the kid-friendly re-tellings of stories that weren't originally even aimed for children. This is something director Michael Vaughn appears to have missed, having turned the story into something that resembles action-packed family movies more than the fables the book imitates.I have mixed feelings about the casting. Charlie Cox is likable enough as the hero of this modern fairy tale, but Claire Danes just isn't convincing as the stubborn star girl, unable to channel the extra-terrestrial earthiness that made the book character so interesting. Sienna Miller, on the other hand, steals all of her few scenes as the spoiled Victoria, giving such a delicious little performance that I wished she had been casted in the leading role instead of Danes. Ricky Gervais and Robert De Niro both have remarkably unfunny supporting roles, at least compared to their usual standard, whereas Mark Strong really caught my eye as the sinister prince Septimus. The real star of Stardust, however, is without doubt Michelle Pfeiffer, who plays the beautiful wicked witch Lamia, easily outshining her co-stars with her charismatic performance and cool charm.Overall, Stardust is mildly entertaining and passable, but not really outstanding in any way. It has a few action scenes too many, a climactic yet tremendously boring final battle that seems to drag on forever, and a leading romantic couple that lacks the chemistry required for the viewer to be genuinely interested in the fate of their relationship. The quality of the film would have improved a great deal if at least half an hour of it had been left on the floor of the cutting room.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Needs Fine Tuning,"This movie was cool entertainment on a very hot summer day, but I don't understand why it was given ""10s"" repeatedly. The dialog wasn't well written, unless you happened to be 13 years old. (with the exception of scenes involving Robert Deniro) The movie initially dragged, then hurled the viewer into adventure after explosive adventure. Special effects were beautiful, yet even novice movie goers noticed editing mistakes and scenes that ""bumped"" rather than flowed into one another. Costuming and sets were remarkable, as was the countryside in which it was filmed, but this movie appeared to lack the extra fine tuning and time it needed to have, to make it into the great movie it could have been.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"OK film, but great book.","Sooo many great parts from the book has been cut out for no apparent reason, as absurd parts have been added! I found myself occasionally bewildered in the film and I had just finished the book.I frankly found the Robert DeNiro performance and character an embarrassment. What was the purpose of making him ravingly gay??? Was this such a great idea it justified dropping vast and essential parts from the book, such as the damned MAIN CHARACTERS? The Ricky Gervais character was actually quite an amusing brief addition.The whole thing appeared to be made by someone who had heard about the book 3rd hand and contained none of the understanding of the characters, the pathos or the love that made the book great.Don't be put off the great book by this barely passable film.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Escapism as it's very best.,"Stardust is too say the least one of the best fantasy/fairytale/adventures of the year. It's combined elements of humor, action, fantasy, and surprise will surely make it a success with the whole family.Stardust's main basis is a love story. A young man (Tristan) sets out into a mystical land too retrieve a fallen star, which he intends too return to his love Victoria (Sienna Miller) in order too win her affection. Upon getting the star which is actually a woman (Claire Danes), Tristan embarks on the perilous journey home. As he goes however a connection develops between Tristan and the star, and he begins to question who he actually loves. This is a very convincing relationship and I tip my hat too Charlie Cox and Claire Dannes for making it all the more real.Other people are seeking the fallen star for their own reasons including three witches and a set of brothers who all wish to become king of the land. This makes for an action packed journey as all three different story lines inter wine and connect throughout the film.As a character Tristan grows and matures over the story, actor Charlie Cox I thought brought a marvelous almost charming naivety too the role. Rickey Gervais plays Ricky Gervais again, and Robert Di Niro supports as the flamboyant Captain, which worked surprisingly well for this film.Stardust has it all from humor to romance, too drama and then to action. It is a solid achievement that really does merit a trip to the cinemas and a DVD purchase. Maybe even a second trip to the cinemas, it really is that good.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An adventure that would last you a lifetime,"Just saw the movie and boy was I astonished. I can't remember the last a fantasy flick has touched my heart (Bridge to Terabithia?). It wasn't a total masterpiece of some sort. But it was, in all respects.... lovely. Sure, it was a combination of clichés (a king in his deathbed, a witch searching for eternal youth and all others) yet somehow it still manages to entertain you all throughout.Was it predictable? Not really. With so many characters involved, you'll really have no idea what's going to happen next. Were the characters lovable? Definitely. The movie makes you adore the characters so much that you'd actually care over what will happen to them. The idea of using ""fresh"" actors/actresses is technically a good thing for this movie. You see, the best thing about using fresh ones is that you'll see them as characters and NOT as stars. (Look at Charlie Cox and you'll see him as Tristan. Look at Captain Shakespeare and you'll see Robert De Niro.) Can your children watch it? Of course. Trust me when I say that if your child watches this movie, he or she will remember this throughout his/her childhood. (Of course, that is assuming that your child isn't a video-game freak).All in all, a really adorable movie. A nice break from writing my dissertation. I'll be sure to buy the DVD when it comes out. And probably the novel itself.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This summer a star falls. The chase begins.,"In a countryside town bordering on a magical land, a young man makes a promise to his beloved that he'll retrieve a fallen star by venturing into the magical realm.Instead of seeing ""Rush Hour 3"" with everyone else, I saw Stardust, instead. And you know what? I bet you Stardust is the better movie. Last year's ""Pan's Labyrinth"" showed us the dark side of fairy tales. Now in this year, Stardust is about to do the same thing, only, it's not as dark.Is Stardust a children's movie? Well, it's scarier and more violent than most. How violent can it get with a PG-13? Well, you would be surprised how far they pushed the envelope. But does that really mean it is not for children? Certainly not. If you like magic or fairy tales, this movie will do. To be honest, I will even go as far as to say this film is better than ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" because it really is.This film is surprisingly imaginative. People teleport with candles, fire burns green, pirates fly, and there are tons more to go. What more can you want? Is this film funny? It's weirdly humorous, if that's possible. It's like a fresh work of comedy, since you have never seen anything like it.The CGI ranges from cheesy to fantastic. The makeup effects are great. The chemistry between Charlie Cox and Claire Danes is also really good. Michelle Pfeiffer plays an evil, dark witch and performances by Jason Flemyng and Mark Strong is also good and everyone has their chance do make a joke every now and then in the movie.This film is hugely entertaining and from all the sequels and remakes this summer, you will want to watch this fresh and original movie because it feels good when you finally get a breath of fresh air. The imagination is there and the performances good. And parents, instead of seeing ""Daddy Day Camp"" with your kids, I rather you watch this film with them, if they like Harry Potter. Stardust is a magical and stunning piece of work.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Better than expected; tightly written story keeps the adults interested too,"I went into this film not knowing what exactly to expect. Trailer made it look like a fairy-tale kind of film, like Princess Bride. Reviews were excellent, so I gave it a try, viewing it with the wife and kids. Everyone was attentive the whole time, and enjoyed it. A nice mix of humor, fantasy action, and fairy-tale kid quality. It has its scary moments, but any kid that can handle Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter can handle this. It was uplifting, and had mildly scary stuff too to keep it interesting. The whole story was tightly written and very interesting, without being confusing and without being too basic and straightforward. Of course a big thumbs up for having been narrated by Ian McKlellan; like having Gandalf telling the story. A thumbs up to the beautiful super-long hair they gave the witch who took on a young form for most of the film. Much better than the ghastly appearances they witches usually had. This story was so tightly and perfectly written that I can't find anyone deserving of my trademark punch in the face comment that I reserve for a character who does something deviantly evil or stupid, so I'll refrain this time. Overall, a nice family film with enough to keep the adults interested as well.See my profile for my rating philosophy.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The movie took every aspect of the book (and a few new ones) and made them truly SHINE!The plot had a complete make over, a very good one. There are some new points added that may be questionable to some but I loved them. The main character...lets just say he got a whole lot hotter as the movie goes on.

Dusty Song,"Don't see this.I don't know the children's' book from which the scenes were stolen. I assume it is successful in the sense of giving the reader channels to be transported to a world that matters.But I do know what works with movies, and not just for myself. The business is all about creating worlds, weaving realities. The big challenge is getting us into a world that makes enough sense for us to rattle around in it, and perhaps be manipulated using its laws. If we are lucky, those manipulations will matter and the film will be worth watching. But that first hurdle is helping us to enter the world.This fails at that front door. Like many other big budget productions with a weak creative coordinator, different bits have been parceled out to creative teams all over the world, and each has created their own miniworlds whose only commonality is that they are ""inspired"" by the book.But they are also inspired by other movies too. The problem is that each team used a different set of movies and thence different worlds, with different symmetries and hinges and refractions. Its incoherent.One single thing could have helped. Nothing ties bits of a movie together like the score, especially when it is heavy like this one. The problem is that the composer used a Wagnerian approach. Now, you don't have to be very knowledgeable about music to have strong opinions about whether Wagner is a burden on or wings for our souls. But either way, it implies a world of its own, a world of Olympian lusts, of simple honor and vast battles. Love isn't a basic force in Wagner's world, its a prize. In the simple story we have here, it is the unified force of everything that happens, a sort of light that affects everything. (The metaphor here is the stars as gods.)So every time something happens in this movie, they turn on this music machine that snaps the world away from any of the worlds we see. Its schizophrenic, like a TeeVee laugh track over Hamlet.It would have helped if they had gotten real actors, too.There are two scenes that are okay. One is the incidental bargaining over a chest full of lightning. Another is the ""landing"" of the ship in water that DeNiro's character pilots. All else is failure.Oh. If you saw ""300"" or ""Perfume,"" you will have seen two recent versions of the incidental redhead as a sort of token of purity. We get a few seconds of the previous star that fell and whose heart was ingested by unloving witches. Its Sting's daughter, artificially and brilliantly reddened.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Impressive, but where are the men?","This chick flick fantasy was supposed to be the after thought also-ran competitor to Disney's ""Enchanted"", the ""Narnia"" films and ""Golden Compass"", but winds up being the better film. It's an improvement on a product that is a rarity when one is trying to follow the market leader in order to sponge his run-off.The sets and situations are all fantasy, but the care taken to execute this film, particularly by hiring the ever beautiful Michelle Pfeiffer to thesp the antagonist role, is quite striking. To me this film surpasses the standard of what ""The Golden Compass"" was trying to set, and also surpasses the ostensibly more young male oriented Narnia films.Do I have any quibbles with this flick? Not as such. Pfeiffer does her usual bang up job of showing us her top of the line acting talent. The film benefits from it. And unlike Nichole Kidman's film, where Kidman has to try to carry a film that seems to have bitten off more than it can chew, Pfeiffer's talents aren't the central focus here. There's a solid cast of actors with excellent acting talents who deliver us characters that stand on their own. As an entertainment piece it's a solid performer when cast and story meld with the SFX and other film elements. A thing that ""The Golden Compass"" never quite achieves.Quibbles? Yes, there a few. Not many, but some. The martial arts exposition was needless. Mixing in east Asian martial arts with western saber fighting, and tossing in Kung Fu theatrics (somersaults and so forth), for me, pushes the film into the outer edges of high-kamp. Just once I'd like to see a masculine hero does what he does best. Unfortunately those days are probably long gone, so we have corporate film making placating to a female demographic.And therein lies the the film's real fault. Right now it's just a solid fantasy film. The acting level is right for this kind of flick, and the plot and story are well received, but it seems to really down play any masculine positives. Which makes one wonder about the fans of this film. Me, I happen to like the exposition, and I have the DVD in my collection, but I would've liked the male leads to have been more proactive. Such a movie would've had a larger cross market appeal, garnished a larger market share, and, most importantly of all, been a better movie as a whole.But, regardless, we do have a solid piece of cinema, even if skewed by corporate studio heads.So... where are the men? Or are they all black hats in this thing?Okay, that was overly harsh. Truth be told I do like this film a great deal. See it.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wonderful movie for everyone!,"I maybe am late with the review, but here it goes.I have seen this movie almost 4 years ago, was amazed for the first time, and I still am every time I watch it. This movie didn't have much of a marketing and because of that I didn't expect anything from it. But, after watching it I was filled with joy, laugh and will to experience and live as much as I can!This movie is suited for everyone from age 7 to 99. In my opinion everyone can find themselves (or at least part of them) in this wonderful movie.Stardust is a mixture of fantasy, tale of friendship, true and pure love, adventure, relationships, all spiced with a pinch of intelligent humor. There is a message and lesson in this movie, about not being deceived with exterior and appearance, but to follow the heart. About basic human feelings and how to direct them.Acting performance was also great. Cast is amazing and I have to say that Robert De Niro obviously had bunch of fun filming it, and he had a great role. Claire Danes is stunning and beautiful as Yvaine, she really had a amazing performance! Movie doesn't get boring in any moment, it keeps you nailed to the chair whole the time with it's subtle and wise plot.

Charlie Cox weak lead and too much time with villains,"There is a doorway to the fantasy kingdom of Stormhold from the English town of Wall village through a break in the town's wall. About 150 years ago, a young man walks through the break and encountered an imprisoned princess. Later, a baby is left at the wall for the young man. The baby would grow up to be Tristan Thorn (Charlie Cox). Tristan pines for reluctant Victoria (Sienna Miller), and goes to catch a fallen star in Stormhold as a gift to win the hand of Victoria. The star's name turns out to be Yvaine (Claire Danes). Others are also looking for the star. Heirs to Stormhold need to find a ruby with Yvaine to get the throne. And a trio of witches led by Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) want the star to make them young.There are a lot of characters and a lot of story to get through at the start. It's too much. It's too complicated before Tristan ever starts his journey. Simplification is the name of the game. There are just too many characters. And the story really should only follow Tristan and Yvaine around. Instead there are too much time spent on the other characters. We keep switching back to the bad guys' plot lines.The other problem is that Charlie Cox is too weak to lead. He doesn't have the acting chops. With so many great actors around him, he just feels very small by comparison. And Claire Danes doing an English accent is very odd. Those two make a strange couple. And they keep trying to tell sly jokes. Maybe it works for the Brits, but it mostly fell flat. I'm sure it was a fun novel to read, but it just ran on as a movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"A bad movie, maybe good for kids.","Firstly, you get attached to the main character who turns out not to be the main character. The switch doesn't work because everything that's supposed to make you attached to the new guy is done way to fast and you can't feel what he does. Next, the characters' decisions are not the guiding force of their quest. What I mean is, everything happens TO the characters, but they make no relevant decisions to sway the outcome. Everything good is coincidence, or someone else's doing, and everything bad, well that's generally someone else's doing anyway, but the point is, there's no struggle of the characters, just THIS HAPPENED< THEN THIS HAPPENED THEN THIS HAPPENED THEN THIS. And therefore, since the movie overall fell flat, all of these great jokes that would have been really funny, fall flat too cause you're so damn underwhelmed by what's happening.This is a good movie for kids around six or eight years old. If you are seeing it with them you'll get a kick out of this movie for the aside jokes for adults, since you're not expecting too much.

Excellent piece of entertainment,"I doubt that there are many people who would place Stardust at the top of their lists of the best films of 2007, but there is little doubting that this film is, if you are in the right mood, an excellent piece of entertainment.The concept of a magical land sited right next to a little area of jolly old England is a nice one, especially as the portal is a simple dry built stone wall, the type that you see throughout the English countryside! The time setting is very interesting, I first thought that the story would have worked better if the English setting was modern era, but on reflection a modern day youth of 16 would be too 'streetwise' to be drawn into the world beyond the wall. Withing this setting the narrative holds no real surprises, and without giving anything away the moral line of Good vs Evil and True Love triumphing - or not as the case may be - is all to familiar to anyone who has any grounding in basic faery tales and fantasy fiction.Allowing for the constraints that the basic storyline gives the film, the film does allow its own elements to breath, and there are no strings left untied that I could see.The performances are all great fun, and all cast members seem to be really enjoying themselves, although there is one 'turn' that steels the show. Mr DeNero is truly a joy to behold! At first he appears to be playing, well DeNero, but then...No, I'm not going to say any more, you will just have to see the film to judge for yourselves! The effects are what you expect from such a film, all very well done, and some are really spectacular. There is nothing here to really disappoint all but the most critical fantasy film fans, and for the causal viewer there is a lot of fun to be had here.Check your brain in at the box office, get yourself a large popcorn and sit back and let this film entertain you for a couple of hours.

Witchcraft and self-irony.,"Ignorant to his heritage a young man decides to chase down and bring back a fallen star to the woman that he is in love with. This commitment brings him to go into an area outside his town village that is prohibited to enter. Once there he realizes that he has entered a fairy-tale land and that he is not the only person chasing the falling star. From here on it's more or less a long chase between him, a prince and three witches.The movie is loaded with self-irony and that is really it's best quality. I must admit that I didn't get involved and that it was more or less the humor that got my attention. I even considered if the ""fantasy""-genre no longer appeals to me but thinking back I realized that there are many movies in this genre that I like. I didn't like the casting and I really think that this has fundamental importance when watching a movie. You have to get involved with the protagonists and I didn't - except maybe for Michelle Pfeiffer (and Peter O'toole) that I think made the best of her part.Not a must see but if you can't wait to see the showdown between Bilbo Baggins and Smaug then this can do while we wait.Regards SimonPs.

Stardust is a ridiculously shallow and cheery film that isn't executed very well at all, yet it JUUUUUST manages to keep me from turning it off in disgust, with a pleasant storyline and good special effects to disguise its mediocrity. The characters are not really developed at all, remaining cardboard cutouts on a colorful backdrop - but at least they are cardboard cutouts that are pleasant to look at. The aesthetics here are top-notch, but they are disguising a flimsy, weak story that has been told many times before.

The most original fantasy I've seen in years...,"I wasn't expecting to like this movie as much as I did, but from the start, it enchanted me. It followed no 'formula' but made it's own way through the classic quest, with stops along the way in the realms of historical romance, fairy tale, fantasy, comedy, action adventure and the always popular coming of age. Neil Gaiman is a favorite of mine anyway and his touch; lyrical, with a hint of darkness, but a core of good, is somewhat reminiscent of 'The Princess Bride'. But unlike that film's simplistic story, 'Stardust' is much richer and more detailed, conveying its tale with wit, charm and the perfect measure of comedic quips from its surprisingly star-filled cast.I won't give anything away, but to say I was delighted is an understatement.

But I cannot believe why Neil Gaiman has accepted to change his story in such a profane manner. It doesn't always have to be the big battle at the end! To tell the original story with the original characters would have made the movie really extraordinary. The actors did a great job, as well as the scenery was done well. But there were to many needless changes in the screenplay (eg. the frequent market in Wall, Captain Shakespeare, Tristans mother and the wanderings of Tristan and Yvaine). Directors: don't try to copy Lord of the Rings - you will miss. Have a look at french movies and how they can really tell a good story!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Plot without Substance,"I love fantasies; I'm a huge fan of the genre. And the idea of a new Princess Bride-like movie, funny and engaging, is very appealing. Unfortunately, I've never read the book, though I've heard good things about Neil Gaiman, of course. Therefore, I can't comment on how close the film was to the source material. I can, however, say that this was a terrible movie.Visually, it's not bad: there's a lot to look at. The acting is all right, even though some of the accents are quite off.But the movie can be best summarized this way: it is plot without substance. There's nothing to this movie: the storyline rings shallow, and there's no real feeling to it. It's simply one plot point after another without any depth. The humor doesn't hit the mark, and the film just ends up very flat and lifeless. It's obvious from the first five minutes how the plot will be resolved, and the film never seems to make an effort to get the viewer to care about that ending.I've seen worse films, certainly, and parts of the disjointed plot are mildly entertaining, but overall this film was quite a failure.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
a beautiful flight of imagination,"please, future writers, producers, directors - learn from this movie!never before have i seen such a bold and original tale created for the big movie screen. bold, because the script constantly made a step so many fantasy movies safely avoided - a step to something new, creative and daring. just when you think 'oh, i've seen this before' or 'i am sure this is what will happen now' - StarDust would make an unexpected twist and involve you more and more into the story.the actors are great - even the smallest part is performed with such talent it fills me with awe for the creators of this movie. Robert De Niro is gorgeous and performs with such energy that he simply steals the show in each scene he's in. Michelle Pfeiffer is the perfect witch, and Claire Danes a wonderful choice for the innocent and loving 'star', Yvaine. Other big names make outstanding roles. I had the filling everyone is trying to give his best for this movie. But once again, the story by Neil Gaiman, all the little things he 'invented' for this universe - simply outstanding.I watched this movie at a pre-screening today, a day before the official release, and do hope it will have huge success. There is so much humor, but also tense moments as well as lovely tender scenes. The look in the eyes of Yvaine, the 'frivolities' of Captain Shakespeare, the passion of Lamia the witch - impressive, unforgettableFor me this is the number one entertaining movie of 2007, watch it and enjoy it11/10 - Outstandingpeace and love",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Long time ago,"A feel good fairy tale that one would tell their children as a bedtime story. Pretty much predictable without any complexities involved. The movie is loaded with CGI and actors which gives it a rich look.º Charlie Cox transformation from a meek lover to sword fighting valiant prince is good. Performance-wise doesn't create any fireworks.º Claire Danes as Yvaine manages to draw attention with her mesmerising smile and looks. She definitely carries herself very well as a star. Her chemistry with Charlie Cox deserves a special mention.º Robert De Nero has so many accolades in his past that it becomes impossible to judge if he has done full justice and we little mortals are incapable to judge the performance. So safe to say ""No Comments"".º Special mention is reserved for Michelle Pfeiffer who infuses life into the role of Lamia, the witch. She was an absolute delight to watch.º Sienna Miller, seriously she picked the wrong role. Anytime Yvaine to gold-digger Victoria. Rupert Everett was wasted in the role.º Its good to see Peter 'O Toole.Worth a day's out activity for an one-time watch with kids.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Chuck Baldwin would not approve, but nobody cares.","Let me open up and say that I did not expect this to be a great film. And while that opinion was not in vain, I found out it isn't the type of film that will make your head hurt. Suffice to say, I found it slightly entertaining. And while the characters were unbelievable, it was meant to be that way.A young man ventures across the wall and meets a woman. She is trapped, but she has a nice 'time' with him. He goes back, and 9 months later a baby boy is delivered to him. That boy grows up and tells he will capture a star for a young woman. But instead, he falls for the star that happens to be a woman.What happens next is a series of events that leads on a wild journey chased by princes, witches, and flying pirates. I had a food laugh at Robert DeNiro showing his effeminate side and dressing like a woman. Of all the characters that had to make homosexual, he was the one. But it wasn't in a overt 'I'm nude and i like the same sex', but simple and trying to best fulfill his father's wishes.Some parts were funny, like the continuing joke with the dead brothers bickering in the after life. But through it all, I was OK with it. Maybe one day I will see it again. ""C+""",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
is this a comedy or a fantasy?,"I had high hopes of 'Stardust' mainly because of its cast, and because of interesting preview trailers. However, now I've seen it, I'm a bit underwhelmed.Charlie Cox isn't the most interesting leading man in the world, and his quest to find a fallen star (Claire Danes, who has grown up a lot since Romeo+Juliet) for his 'one true love' Victoria (a tiresome Sienna Miller) is confusing and a bit silly.Many cast members are underused, notably those who play the sons of the King, and prospective heirs to the throne. Some casting is plain odd (is there ever a reason to cast Ricky Gervais?), although there is a nice turn from Robert de Niro as the pirate Captain who may not be all he seems.Special effects pale a bit to other fantasy films (Narnia, Harry Potter, LOTR) but they're OK, and it is always nice to see Michelle Pfieffer in a leading role.It just doesn't live up to its promise, perhaps because it can't make its mind up whether it is a send-up or the real thing.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Fine fantasy, completely worth the time.","Fun and funny with a love plot just sappy enough to enjoy. Has a good coming of age moral to story.

A timeless piece.,"When this film was release in Mexico I don't see it in a movie theater. But I always keep in my mind, all the wonderful actors that I saw in the trailer (O'Toole, De Niro, Pfieffer, etc.) maybe they know something more.At the beginning I don't expect anything from this picture, maybe another bad imitation of Harry Potter or the Lord of the Rings, you know a lot of unnecessary CGI animations, over react actors, plot holes, talking animals.But some how traps me with it's magic, perfect direction, wonderful actors, excellent production and ultra story.The plot is simple and complex, is a story about true love and his meaning. St Thomas Aquinas say love is the renunciation of yourself"", maybe this sound a little corny but, that is the best definition of love in history of philosophy, and this movie tell you in any single frame of it that simple statement.My congratulations to Miss Claire Danes and Mr. Charlie Cox, they deliver to us a lovely screen couple any single actor in this picture are perfect, great casting.Also, I love the ghost brothers, and his wonderful English humor.Maybe I don't know what I'm talking about, but I think this movie is going to be a classic fantasy story like the ""Princes Bride"".For last like Blade Runner, Citizen Kane, The Thing and many others, remember that box office is doesn't an ingredient of timeless piece.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Could have been put together better,"I did eventually like this movie but it was in no way the same caliber as The Princess Bride. The characters would do things that would make no sense other then to keep the plot going. It was a seemingly alright story with times where you wondering why the character did what he/she did. There seemed to be no cleverness to the situations and too many unbelievable moments which was probably due to not enough plot development. I really was waiting for a movie like this one and was hoping that it had the same magic as The Princess Bride, but it just barely missed the mark. The sound was great, the score matched the movie and the special effects well enough but if you have to keep asking how or why that happened then you will never fully be engulfed in the magic of the film. I did however enjoy the movie more once getting into the characters. The acting and the outline of the story is what makes this movie work.

Another proof that mediocrity rules for good,"Yes, this movie's success is all about today's cinema mediocrity and how people were conditioned to not only accept it, but actually welcome it, and even celebrate it. The new kitsch reigns. Halleluja, the cynical executives got what they wanted, they can dumb their stuff down as much as they like, and still make millions out of it. Just follow the recipe and you're good, whatever the awkwardness, the lousiness of the product. So why even bother to make things right, like in ""Azkaban"", ""Legend"", ""Dark Crystal"", ""Babe"", or even ""Nanny McPhee"", when stuff like ""Stardust"" or the ""Chronicles of Narnja"" are perceived as great magical movies?I have totally lost faith in people's ability to resist the cultural brainwashing leading to embrace such appalling, spurious, pinchbeck, mundane movie-making, with so much incoherence and lack of vision that it's painful.No magic here. Just the usual pretty postcards, with lots of baubles and knick-knack, and a pot-pourri story with all of the usual clichés. And don't start me about the direction and staging.

Wow...,"I've read the novel, seen the film 3 times in theatre, got the poster&the illustrated novel, rent the DVD, bought the DVD as for friends, and planned to buy one for myself as well. In other words, I love it. It offered much more than the trailer suggested & I am ecstatic every time I watch it. The cast is superb (""Ian McKellan & Peter O'toole"" pretty much seals the deal but the movie had much more). To make sure my praises speak volume, I must mention some shortcomings that bothered me personally. Although I'd have loved Claire Danes to have a more natural accent (which would work since she is a star and not necessarily English), she seemed to manage well. A forced climactic scene near the end disappointed me but the humor around it made up for the fact. I wish the film would have kept the greater length of the ""journey"" from the book but this would have taken away the urgency and excitement which made the movie so good to watch. W/o a doubt, the scores alone would've impressed me but they complemented the scenes quite well. Visually, each frame was a sight for sore eyes: a wide range of locations all wonderfully cinematographed (if that's a word). The thing about Stardust is it offers everything you would want to see in a film: creative storyline, likable characters, content, action, adventure, comedy, romance, suspense, awesome score and a healthy dose of violence. I will admit however- its atmosphere and pace are different from the novel (if you love the novel, there is a SMALL chance that you might disagree w/ the movie adaptation) but my personal assurance is that this movie delivers.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Amazing movie,This is an amazing fantasy movie with an unusual story line that was easy to follow but (at least to me) not predictable. The journey of the two main character from initial loathing to learning to love each other is well done and moving. Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert de Niro and phenomenal in their supporting roles.

Instead a lot of time is spent on developing the characters.My family has watched this movie many times (at least once every two years) and we love it.,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Just wonderful,"Stardust is just a fantasy movie like I want it to be. It does have excitement, humor, colorful characters and a good story. That it does contain magic and witchcraft is a plus too. I rather have this than the endless battle scenes you got to see in for example Lord of the Rings. There is not much fighting going on in this movie so the filmmaker concentrated could concentrate much more on the plot and does a very good job of that. The story might have been done before but it's certainly not something that I would expect in a fantasy movie. I want to give a special mention to Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert de Niro who really excel in their roles. They do have so much experience and prove despite their age they have not lost any of their great acting abilities. Michelle was perfect as the bad but beautiful witch which was not her first time in such a role as she played some kind of a witch in the Witches of Eastwick long before this one. De Niro was really funny in his role as the commander of an air ship and I really had a good laugh with one particular scene of him. Yes the humor is absurd at times like the princes who die one by one and land as ghosts into a waiting room watching the story develop as if they were sitting in theater as well. Bu that didn't bother me one thing, on the contrary it was refreshing. Okay the love story of this movie might be quite cliché and predictable but it didn't make me think of the movie less. I just love it and would recommend it to anyone who loves an entertaining movie.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A modern Fast Food Fairy Tale American Style,"This movie was well presented in the trailers, so I decided to go see it. The cast was also part of this decision, being Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert De Niro among my favorite actors. When it comes to the story however, one may think that Americans are desperately seeking for a moral recovery, for the restoration of lost values, for love, for a message of peace (the American one though, like the Pax Romana in ancient times) to the world. It seems they want to present themselves to the eyes of the world in a way which is so in contrast'to the reality which we see every day in the news. The story has nothing to say which has not yet been told. There are parts which add nothing and are more ridiculous than funny (like the brothers which become spirits after been killed and act as fans and spectators to the events). And what kind of witch is Michelle, if she is not able to solve her tasks on her own? Seems the production has no clear concept.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Very entertaining,"My 13-year-old son and I went to see this without knowing anything about it except for what we saw in the trailer. (A friend had recommended the book it is based on, but neither of us had gotten around to that yet.) So we didn't really have any expectations about it, and we LOVED this movie. We thought it was one of the best films we have seen in the past several years. The cinematography is beautiful, and the special effects are really great. It is a very good fantasy story, but is also very funny in places. (My son said it wasn't just a comedy with some fantasy elements, which he thought would have been a bad thing, for some reason). I thought both Robert DeNiro and Michelle Pfeiffer turned in terrific performances. Also, it is fun to see the transformation in attitudes of both of the main characters, Tristan and Yvaine over the course of the movie.

Hollywood At It's Wankiest,"If it's true that Miramax originally had the rights and gave it up, they must have realized that this was a movie (and a script) that really wasn't worth the bother.

Fairy tales like the Princess Bride, Lord Of The Rings, and, Harry Potter, bring something fresh and relateable to an audience that has been inundated by commercial film-making for decades. Those films were very good on all levels and their story lines worked. This is mainly because of the writers who wrote them. They knew how to tell a story and grab the viewer. Unfortunately, this movie should not be mentioned in the same breath as the others. There are some bright spots, namely, Michelle Pfeiffer, who is perfectly over the top and who does a bang up job with her role. There are others, but, the DeNiro role could have been done by a dozen other actors, but, it helps to have a name like his in your otherwise, absurd, badly written, movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Fun, but with a big flaw","People seem to need to compare this to The Princess Bride, and I'm not sure why; they have very little in common but being fantasies (this one much more so than TPB) with good production values and not relying too much on big excitement. That's about it. OK, if that's an obligatory comparison, here are the differences: Stardust has magic, and The Princess Bride has likable, enjoyable characters. Oh, and TPB has a tremendously witty script, which Stardust doesn't; just clever in parts.To be fair, there are two or three distinctly likable characters in Stardust, but they aren't present for the greater part of the movie; and for me, that was a big issue. Most of the characters are well done, but they range from truly evil to wantonly vicious to somewhat immature and peevish. In the abstract, taken as story elements, they seem like great ideas, but you wouldn't actually want to spend time with them.Watching this film as escapism is fine. It's almost suitable for young children, but not really: sexual references and violence are not graphic or gross, but the prevalence of selfishness, including random and thoughtless killing, although not bloody, would be disturbing. Clare Danes is fairly magnetic, although not lovable, and the premises and story line are nicely twisted. Mark Williams turns in a nicely quirky performance, as always, and the visuals are smooth and attractive. Robert De Niro is charming as well as whimsical, but oddly, he's the only one.

However it comfortably falls into its role as a stereotypical fairytale and if your after a happily ever after story then this one is definitely for you.The acting in my opinion generally delivers, with Robert De Niro particularly shining. Charlie Cox and Claire Danes play their characters well, even though they lack originality which would have really given this film a spark. My personal favourites came in the form of the Severn Brothers including David Walliams and Rupert Everret.

Stardust was blessed with great acting, from top-notch Claire Danes in the leading role down to the great acting from the First Officer of the ship. It really has an original plot line compared to a lot of fantasy movies that have been made recently which was accompanied by a great sound track.The first minute or so of a movie is crucial. This was very well done by the view, great soundtrack and Ian McKellen for narrator, which I have to say that gives any movie he is a part of, even if it is a very minor role, a positive boost.I loved how this movie was just plain funny but managed to make a serious mood for the important parts. There was also a added bonus that at times it made you reflect on yourself, especially when Yvaine was explaining what she saw as she looked down to earth. Her words were so full of truth. Even though humanity has done a lot of evil in the world there is always the possibility of good and love in us.All in all, this movie has really exceeded my expectations. I thought it would be just another bad movie based on a good book; Eragon anyone? Though it managed to provide much more then that. I highly recommend it to anyone.

Great visual effects, a story that keeps you on your toes at every turn. A film worthy of the genre, in a league with Harry Potter and even LOTR!

a beautiful film with faulty taste of love and romance,"right after the film was progressed before 8 minutes, i've found the whole storyline was wrongly scripted with a terrible mistake: how could our hero, the young man we called 'tristan' would have possibly been arranged to fall for a self-centered, self-important, arrogant, material-focus, absolutely snobbish girl, victoria? if this young man would have to be arranged into becoming a great man, his taste for a girl/woman like victoria would only proved that he got a very bad judgment about almost everything, because if he couldn't distinguish what was a good or bad woman, he would never have the possibility to become a great man. besides, his lame, timid, shy attitude and his unrighteously behavior as a employee in the village's grocery further proved his stupidity and inability to become a great man. those behaviors only showed him the possibility to become a mediocre lamer, because they were his born characteristics, his unchangeable personalities, his real qualities. there's no way under any circumstance or any situation he would have become great. this is a beautifully produced lovely film but with a undeniable fatal flaw that i would never accept it convincingly enough.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

It's almost what you can expect from a filmed children's fairytale.,"This is one that hasn't aged very well, and there's a very simple reason for that. The story of this movie is an average children's fairytale. Delightful fantasy elements but uninteresting characters, a simple sense of humor that makes you smile at times, cringe and cliché love twist. You get the picture.By its nature, this film only has two potentially valuable things to offer: its visual reflection of the fairytale world which it is set and its fairytale style storytelling. And as you know, visual effects and stage design can get old very quickly. And this movie was not very dazzling in this regard, even in the year it was shot.The only element of the movie that we could call surprising was the captain. He was someone you wouldn't expect in a fairytale. Of course, the captain was no surprise to anyone who saw the name Neil Gaiman on the main material.All the points I give are for the sweet fantasy world breeze which I felt.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I liked it but didn't love it,I was engaged throughout most of the movie. I'm not sure what else to say besides it was an enjoyable ride. But did I think it was a great movie? Not really. This may be a weird criticism but I actually liked Victoria a little better than Yvaine. Maybe that's because she was a more relate-able realistic woman compared to the perfect princess type of character of Yvaine. I felt bad for her in the end. But it is a fairy tale after all so realism isn't quite what they were going for. The CGI was a little over the top at times but it never got too distracting. The humor scattered throughout definitely improved the movie. Especially the ghost princes haha.,6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Neil Gaiman on screen at last,"Finally a Neil Gaiman story has been successfully brought to the screen. Mirror Mask was a fascinating movie artistically, but not nearly so engaging as Stardust. With an easy story telling approach, reminiscent of Princess Bride, Stardust captures Gaiman's sense of magic coexisting alongside our mundane existence. Unlike the Rowland's Harry Potter, Gaiman's magic has a decidedly sharper, nastier edge, but at the same time there is a marvelous sense of humor and the story really never takes itself too seriously. As for the cast, Peter O'Toole and Robert De Niro were hilarious, and Michelle Pfeiffer really held the story together with her witchiness. The leading protagonists were fun. Clare Danes as the star had simple grace and good humor which well balanced Charlie Cox's faltering steps toward manhood. All in all, it was a great family movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stardust a Sparkling Success,"Matthew Vaughan, bringer of classy film Layer Cake along with Daniel Craig and Sienna Miller, he is already in my good books. Neil Gaiman, huge fantasy writer whose imagination and storytelling is top notch. Put the two together and the result bested the entire selection of 2007's summer blockbusters. Stardust is quite simply a great film. The story is clever, quick-paced and funny, the characters lovable and performed to perfection by a superb cast. Stardust is a film that will be popular for years to come, a film that can be watched over and over. It certainly stands among the strongest of its genre, a genre which has, of late, become a mixed bag of mediocre offerings.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Magical and hilarious,"This one was quite a pleasant surprise indeed! Having seen the trailer long ago, I went to see this movie with the lowest of expectations. I think that trailer was the one to blame... The flick had nothing to do with it whatsoever. This one has ""cult"" written all over it, it is destined to become a classic! Judging from its mediocre performance at the box office so far - entirely due to bad marketing - I am afraid it is going to take a while for Stardust to gain the appreciation it deserves, but it will surely be remembered ten years from now.The movie itself is a rare mixture of fantasy, adventure, romance and comedy. And by rare I mean that the combination actually works and in a very major way! It is hilarious without ending up being childish or silly, majestic without being ridiculous and romantic without being sappy. The way it balances all these elements is an amazing accomplishment by itself. This is probably in large due to the origin of the story itself - Stardust is a novel by Neil Gaiman, renowned for the SandMan graphic novels - which proves that a great story is essential to make a great movie. But the material is also exploited in a very competent way by director Matthew Vaughn (of Layer Cake), with style, a fresh view and without resorting to cliché solutions. This isn't the norm when fantasy novels are turned into feature films, where we have a ton of examples with great stories backfiring due to bad directing. There where shots in the film that literally amazed me with their originality, power and immaculate execution. The whole shooting star sequence made my jaw hit the ground! It has been a long time since I 've seen such a beautifully directed sequence - regardless of genre. The combination of visuals and musical score in this one is just magnificent, perhaps one of the best I can think of. And to think that just moments before I was laughing... This is an example of the elegant way in which comedy is interwoven with awe and magic and despair and emotion in this film. I guess it takes a newcomer's fresh perspective on the subject to infuse a project with some vision and originality - this is Vaughn's second feature film.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not bad. Could have been better.,"Let's start with stating that I am not a fan of Neil Gaiman. I haven't read the book so I cannot make comparisons between that and the film.Now, to the film in question:I liked it. The actors do their jobs well as should be expected. The plot is a romantic adventure and the film delivers indeed.Special effects? No complaints at all.Obviously there are the occasional plot holes and logical flaws, but that is to be expected since it is a tale and thus not supposed to be a documentary.I do have some complaints though. As someone stated before: Too many man-animal transformations. It gets boring after a while.The pacing is too fast in my opinion. Had the movie been, say, 30-45 minutes longer the overall impression would have improved and some/several of the main characters could have been properly introduced and given some much needed depth.In summary: A likable movie. I recommend it for fans of the genre and fans of Neil Gaiman and it can be seen by kids and adults alike.Not the greatest work ever made, but certainly not the worst either.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Star light, star bright","Matthew Vaughn's film adaptation of the Neil Gaiman's novella ""Stardust"" is a pleasant surprise in that I didn't know what to expect of it beforehand. For one, ""Mirrormask,"" the other Gaiman material adapted to the big screen wasn't much of an experience worthy of its source. Also, the trailer didn't look at all exciting. But somehow, the lowered expectations helped in a genuinely satisfying experience.""Stardust"" is set more than a century ago and tells the story of Tristan (Charlie Cox), a young man from Wall, England, who sets out to the other side of a wall, to a magical kingdom, in search of the star that fell from the sky so that he can get the hand of Victoria (Sienna Miller) in marriage. It turns out that the star is not in the form of a piece of rock but of a young woman named Yvaine (Claire Danes). And he's not alone as Lamia (michelle Pfeiffer), one of the three witch sisters, is also in pursuit of the star whose heart is said to be the key to immortality. Add in the fact that Yvaine has found a diamond necklace at the site where she fell, which is the object of desire of two king-wannabes, who now has to find Yvaine to retrieve the necklace.What ensues is an old-fashioned fantasy film that plays more as a fairy tale for grown-ups, which while never reaches the heights of last year's ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" succeeds in presenting a dazzling imagination and wry humor that keep you engaged during its running time. The battalion of intersecting plot lines make for an overall uneven experience but co-writer/director Vaughn and co-writer Jane Goldman keep the proceedings lively with the script's banteringly amusing nature.Leads Cox and Danes generate genuine chemistry so much so that it's easy to categorize their pairing for a romantic comedy that all the more that calls to mind ""The Princess Bride."" The supporting cast that include Robert De Niro and Pfeiffer easily ham it up without going overboard.Overall, ""Stardust"" is a magical experience. It may not be a definitive adaptation but it's definitely worth the two hours.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good plot,"The movie has a good plot and story, and overall quite entertaining. However, I think the execution is pretty messy. I also feel the score is poorly written, and it often takes up too much place. For example, there is one, suspenseful scene, where the score kind of ruins the suspense. I also found it annoying that one of the main themes bore a stark resemblance to the ""Shire theme"" from Lord of The Rings.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"lazy cinema, another wasted opportunity","This film really has the cast one usually dreams of. There are so many familiar faces explicitly there that it's easy to overlook several others who are partly masked by their roles as dead people, for example. Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert de Niro both coast through, relaying on their innate magnetism and charisma to make up for the deafening lack of direction and appalling script. Above all else, this is a lazy film. It depends on a trite, cliché-ridden musical score to lift every change of scene and hint at a chase: it really pounds one into submission (not me, I hasten to add) with its feeble, derivative invention. The editing of the film seems almost random. One moves from one strand of the plot to another with the randomness of a game of snakes and ladders. The premise of the story is enchanting; everything was in place for a great fantasy adventure; but first one needs a bit of drive and flair from those in charge. Apart from a few witty moments, not least with Ricky Gervais almost reprising his Office persona, this film is a waste of two hours and a huge sum of money.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Does Stardust work for everyone?,"I saw this movie last night and I thought it was very good in some ways. There were some things that I was impressed with and some were not impressed with. On the one hand Michelle Pfeiffer, one of Hollywoods best known actresses, gave a tremendous performance as the evil queen. Don't get me wrong this was a very good movie. The special effects were excellent, the costumes were good. One thing that I was not expecting was seeing Robert DeNiro cross dressing. That did not paint a very good mental picture for me. I like Bobby DeNiro, but could have casted someone else for that role. We are introduced to the man who will be playing young Prince Caspian in the upcoming Disney/Walden Media film The Chronicles of Narnia:Prince Caspain. Overall, Stardust did not bite the dust.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Certainly Enjoyabls,but a Very Messy Plot and the Lead Roles don't Shine,","Stardust is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a great cast.It certainly wasn't the fun fantasy movie I was expecting it to be,it did look beautiful and I won't deny that many scenes were very enjoyable visually,but it simply wasn't as good as it could have been,although I know many people will disagree seeing that this has a 7.7 rating.The performances that stood out the most for me were the supporting roles and the cameos,Robert de Niro was terrific as he takes a turn at being the comic relief,Michelle Pfeiffer shines as Lamia,Ricky Gervais's cameo was a highlight for me,and Ian McKellen's narration was superb.I was really not taken with the lead roles,I know that Matthew Vaughn likes putting small actors in the lead,with a host of very well known faces to support them,but Charlie Cox and Claire Danes,for me,just didn't shine in any way,their characters were cliché,boring and with all the unique characters surrounding them I just kept losing more interest in their love story.Stardust is certainly not outstanding and has many faults,but its a fun fantasy and adventure that is worth a watch if you ever see it on television.A young man makes a promise to his loved one that he will retrieve a fallen star by entering a magical land,but his adventure is not as straight forward as it may have originally seemed.Best Performance: Robert de Niro",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better than the book,"Neil Gaiman is at his best in Sandman and with Pratchett in Good Omens. He's a wonderful writer, but I didn't like Stardust nearly as much as some of his other work. So this film was a pleasant surprise -- one of the very few screenplays that actually surpass the original material. It's fair to say that the typical movie based on a book tends to fall far below the bar set by the book, but this is clearly the opposite.I hope Neil is happy with this adaption, because it brings out the best of the book. The casting is a pure joy, the directing has a light but steady hand, the pacing was perfect, and the special effects were not overwhelming. The film somehow managed to balance several genres at once without becoming smug about it.An unexpected and lovely pleasure.It's a pity the marketing for this film has been so poor, because by all rights this film should be doing much better at the box office than it has so far.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
De Niro Up To Eleven,"Good fantasy movie in a similar vein to The Princess Bride, Stardust is a fun gem of a movie. Robert De Niro steals the show as a flamboyant sky pirate and Michelle Pfeiffer is having a ball in a wicked witch role. There are lots of nice turns from people such as Ricky Gervais to Peter O'Toole and the movie moves at a good pace despite the run time. The only problem with the movie, and it's a significant one, is Claire Danes & Charlie Cox in the lead roles. Danes just doesn't convey star quality (pardon the pun) and her and Cox are very bland throughout. Good thing that supporting cast is there then.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Enchanting fairy tale,"A farm boy Tristan (Charlie Cox) loves a icy ""princess"" (Sienna Miller) and vows to get her a star, but many others are after the star (Claire Danes).

The star is eventually saved by Tristan, the riddle of his parentage solved and all is happy ever after. The journey is magical, the lead man is fluff but the rest of the cast, sp.

Fake stardust,"This movie doesn't quite know what it wants to be: a fairy-tale? A fantasy film? An adventure? A romance? A comedy? It's allover the place. Anyway, it's the comedic bits that stand out the most. There's quite a few laughs to be had here. The romance bits are typically emotive, but that's not so hard to accomplish. So let's demolish them. Imagine, if you will, that instead of a love story between cutie-face Charlie Cox and miss shinny star Claire Danes, you get one between Susan Boyle and Michael Moore. Ouch. That wouldn't be a fairy-tale but a Dardenne Bros film. On the direction front, the CGI range from quite decent, to casual and impromptu.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stardust A Pleasant Surprise,"Let me first start off by saying I'm not a big fan of these movies but this one surpassed my expectations and as a man I'm not embarrassed to say that. Without giving too much of the plot away for those of you who haven't seen it or read the book. Stardust is an action adventure fantasy fairy tale with a coming of age story, romance, and plenty of humor. The talented cast do a magnificent job including Claire Danes, Charlie Cox, Michelle Pfieffer, and Robert De Niro. Claire Danes was the perfect choice as Yvaine. Claire's strikingly beautiful, smart, and feisty completely believable as the fallen star who crashes to Earth. She's a remarkable actress one of the very best in Hollywood today. She's been excellent in all her films and continues to prove it in Stardust. Well done. Newcomer Charlie Cox also does a good job as Tristan the poor boy who becomes a man and later the hero. Claire Danes and Charlie Cox had great chemistry together that really showed on the screen. Michelle Pfieffer is a solid villain deliciously evil as the sexy witch Lamia and Robert De Niro is terrific as Captain Shakespare the fearsome pirate with a hilarious secret. In fact everything about this film was great. Stardust is fast paced even with a running time of over two hours and it leaves you entertained by the end. Not too many movies come along where you care for the characters and you feel part of the adventure. The director Matthew Vaughn did an admirable job doing that adapting the movie from a book by best selling author Neil Gaiman. He brought this fantastic imaginary world to life giving time for the characters and romance to develop with decent action sequences plus lots of hilarious moments that will make you crack up laughing at least I did. Stardust was a pleasant surprise from all the threequels that came out in 2007 some good - The Bourne Ultimatum and Shrek The Third - some okay but over-hyped and somewhat disappointing - Spider-Man 3 and Pirates 3 - and others that were just horrible - Rush Hour 3 to name one. Hollywood should really start making more films like Stardust with a compelling story, memorable characters who are well developed, action, adventure, romance, and humor instead of just trying to cash in on a quick buck. Overall Stardust was the perfect example of a great fairy tale done right. It's got something in it for just about everyone. Definitely one of the best movies that came out during the summer of 2007. As long as you enjoy watching movies and like to escape into a fantastic imaginary world for two hours then go see it. You won't be disappointed.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A pretty fantasy movie everyone should enjoy,"I am not a fan of fantasy movies in general, which is why I was initially unsure about watching this movie, but I was encouraged to see it because of the amazing cast, and I do not regret seeing it for a single second. I feel that this movie has elements that everyone, no matter what age they are, can enjoy. It has all the connotations of a regular fairytale, but with twists that keep older viewers entertained.The acting displayed by Claire Danes was beautiful, and her scenes opposite Charlie Cox showed amazing on-screen chemistry, and kept you drawn in. Michelle Pfeiffer was also amazing to watch, and played the role excellently.Whether you enjoy fantasy movies, liked the book, or are just looking for a good movie to watch, I would strongly recommend this. If not for all the reasons I've listed above, but because of the amazing special effects, and rich storyline.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertaining time-filler,"Hurled into the UK public's consciousness late in '07 largely on the basis of the Take That single over the end credits and Jonathan Ross's shameless plugging of wifey's script on his own chat show, Stardust is an enjoyable enough fantasy adventure aimed presumably at the early-teens, which you sense never quite manages to be as magical as it is trying to be.Charlie Cox gets his big break here as Tristan Thorne, a likable young man who crosses the Wall to a mystical land to find a star that will prove his love for the fickle Victoria (Sienna Miller). Cox is amiable enough but is a little too bland or my liking to sustain a career as a leading man. Despite an eye-catching cameo from Robert de Niro as a cross-dressing sky pirate who likes nothing more than slapping on the make-up to dance the can-can when alone in his quarters, it's Michelle Pfeiffer, in her first role for some time, who steals the show as one of a trio of decrepit old witches who are also in pursuit of a star to rejuvenate themselves. This is largely because de Niro bungles his part, seemingly unable to manage the camp feyness he reveals to Tristan but which he conceals behind a bluff macho façade in front of his crew. Ricky Gervaise is also amusing, even though he's pretty much playing David Brent in a pointy hat.The story is entertaining enough, even though it adds nothing new to the genre and bears a strong resemblance to Princess Bride at times. It's the kind of film that will probably delight the kids without boring their parents, even though some of its ideas seem underdeveloped. At times the editing leaves something to be desired with a couple of scenes ending too abruptly and emphasising more adroitly how important rhythm is to a film than any editing masterworks could ever do.Watch it, though, and you'll be entertained even though you may well not bother recommending it to others.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Amazing family film - we all throughly enjoyed every minute and would watch again,"Amazing film... if you haven't seen this then I would really recommend. This is a real gem and lost one to me... for some reason I missed this film when it was released .. maybe because there were other good films out in 2007, or maybe because my children were young? Anyway we had a dreary Saturday afternoon with my son not feeling so well. I heard about this film after watching Music channel and Take That song came on. I saw background scenes and realized 'Rule the World' was from the film Stardust. I checked out on IMDb and saw the great ratings and feedback so I got the film. My son not feeling too good didn't want to watch it as he had not heard of it. So I said OK lets put it on for 10 minutes, if you don't like we switch off and put something else on... 5 minutes into it we were all engrossed ... We didn't even think about the 10 minute rule. The film is very funny. Some real great moments that you won't see coming!

Inventive and oddly compelling adventure film about a character experiencing things outside of his comfort zone running on an engaging chase narrative and blunt hybridisation.,"For the most part, Stardust unfolds like some kind of concoction of Peckinpah's Ride the High Country with Midnight Run by way of the magic or ingenuity of a J.K. Rowling novel - and all of it filtered down and through a lens for people of about fifteen and upwards. Not that there's much wrong with any of that, Matthew Vaughn's 2007 follow up to his quite blistering 2004 debut Layer Cake coming to form that of a fair old frolic through some territory engulfing rather a lot of black comedy; some neat creativity born out of the film's alternate world setting full of ingenuity and its own infrastructure; affectionate characters undergoing somewhat moving arcs and a wonderfully clinical sense of progression as things are kept moving along without ever being allowed to slouch.The film begins with a voice over, a voice over read by that of Ian McKellen, whom just has the natural ability to make absolutely anything in the world sound as if it's the most important thing you've ever heard. Like a bedtime story, like someone that has read the same tale a thousand times and knows both the precise pitch as well as the tone which ought to accompany proceedings from the off, this fable-like telling of a fable-like tale begins warmly and enthusiastically, and is difficult not to become as involved in as the above suggests would like you to be. The opening tells the tale of how a certain Tristan came to be born, Charlie Cox's character coming about to exist when his father escaped from his sheltered existence in a remote English village named Wall and into the magical mythical world full of wonder; enchantment and young enslaved women named Stormhold – a place kept apart by a lone stone wall of a few feet in height one wonders why it is not harder to cross.Fast forward twenty or so years, and Tristan is a bit of a wimp whilst still living in the town of Wall; a place in which nothing has changed and everything has remained stilted. While allured by the portal into Stormhold, still guarded ably by an elderly man who's no slouch with a crook, his more immediate concerns lie with his love for Sienna Miller's Victoria, a girl already with a potential suitor whose request for marriage has already come through, but someone whom appears loose enough to break off such an engagement if it means Tristan is successful in a quest she playfully sets him. This item, the Macguffin, of which is later provided with its own personality, so not just a pretty face needing rescuing, is a fallen star named Yvaine (Danes); an item both the power mad brothers, sons of a dying king whose throne is up for grabs, predominantly focusing on Septimus (Strong) need in order to garner said rule but whose quest will not be any easier as they go up against three evil witches, whose fate of eternal youth and grossly enhanced magical powers is on the line should one of them, Lamia, fail in bringing it back. The three witches live life as old; bedraggled; wrinkled coots self-knowingly ugly as sin, Lamia's transformation from this into something a little more 'photogenic', so as to blend into Stormhold more easily, sees her morph not into some model-turned-singer-turned actress under thirty the film may have cast, but Michelle Pfeiffer - such is the manner in which Pfeiffer has aged so gracefully.Principally, the film is about this young man in Tristan desperately wanting to venture out beyond what he knows and entrusts to impress somebody he barely knows beyond that of looks from afar and bare bones reputation. His experiences in Stormhold, making up the crux of his circular journey, turn out to be rather frightening and somewhat dangerous and his coming into contact with this fallen star Yvaine sees him learn to both accept and respect what it is he has to begin with as well as to come to learn how to love a member of the opposite sex through ties and bonds which unfold naturally over a set period of time over lusting for the town's pretty-girl everybody wants a chance at. In depicting such notions, the film is quick to portray the predominant female characters as vampish or even evil; Yvaine representing the ultimate in purity or innocence whom, in the eyes of the film, are far more accessible and righteous and allow the protagonist to see sense.The film is a road movie of sorts, a touching enough romance contributing to a young man's exposure to the world and an at once brutal chase movie documenting some fairly desperate characters each chasing the same item for sake of respective goals leaning towards absolute power and/or pride. Its combinative aura of hybridisation and homage is encapsulated in both its dizzy supporting cast of screen legends and lower-key British talent whom, up until only a few years ago, were more inclined towards televisual work as well as its spasmodic leaping from content more inclined towards fantasy, fairytale and adventure clashing with some rather violent sequences egged on by the infrequent helping of animal cruelty. Regardless, Vaughn is a director that knows how to keep things moving along; he knows he's running off of a plot that might've been torn from a mid-50s, Classical era Hollywood B-movie Western feature of about 85 minutes and just runs with it – the results, of which, are more often than not really quite funny; somewhat practical and remarkably absorbing.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic,"I'm not usually a fan of the fantasy genre but this is one Fairy Tale that pleasantly surprised me and had me hooked from the beginning. A wonderful cast reads like a Who's Who of contemporary British acting talent (with the exception of non-actor Gervais) so it was curious to see Claire Danes in the ""star"" role - she is neither English nor classically beautiful in the Fairy Tale sense.I must, however, give her 10/10 for her impeccable English accent - few things irritate me more than when American and British actors are cast as the other nationality, and I can think of no other actor from either side of the pond who has mastered the foreign accent better than Danes. Still, neither country is so short of talent that such a reversal is necessary.It also annoys me when beautiful women are cast as old hags - Sarah Alexander is one of the most beautiful women on the planet! Her performance here still merits a special mention - it may be a small role but she makes the most of it. Indeed, so many of the supporting players give exceptional performances, that alone makes the movie worth watching.A lovely story, wonderful scenery and the odd if obligatory special effect combine with solid acting and directing to make this a must-see for all the family.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This movie Rocks!,"First things first to all you haters out there DO NOT COMPARE THE BOOK TO THE MOVIE OR VICE VERSA! They are two different entities people...movie makers cannot possibly put the details of a book in a movie. If you think you can, then you can start a revolution. So don't get so boo hooey when the movie is not like the book. Ahhh since i have that off my plate I can start by saying that this movie rocks. It is fairy tale/ fantasy extravaganza brought to life. Great acting, casting and effects all together. It is the story of a boy who becomes a man and is in essence a love story. And whether you like to admit or not there's is school girl in all of a us thats a sucker for a good love story =)). This story takes place in a town that holds a secret..a great wall separates them from an enchanted kingdom, where no one has ever dared to tread the kingdom of Stormhold. The story revolves around Tristan, a young man in love with a girl called Victoria who couldn't care less (we all heard that one before). A star falls from the sky when he tries to woo her and he promises to bring it back to her for her hand in marriage. The quest becomes and adventure full of magic, murder, corruption and looooove.The magical Kingdom of Stormhold has just lost their king the star that has fallen from the sky is of great importance. 3 powerful Witches (Pfifer who plays and excellent villain!) that crave youth and beauty are also after the star. So basically everyones after the star. I can go on and on but Ill stop here! Whats good about this movie is its not predictable, which is rare in this day an age. It is a rich tapestry which slowly unravels. Never a dull moment!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
No surprises,"I was looking forward to see this film six month before its release. I really like fantasy and fairy tales. When I watched this film I found it all right - it had a topic, nice dresses, decent actors and some nice CG - but something essential was missing. In the second half I was even bored and wondered how much longer this movie goes on. I am not in the movie business, so I don't really know, but I think the director's work was to blame. Neighter the hero nor the heroine was appealing for me, so I could not live the story with them. There was humor in the film, but it was pretty random: I did not know whether to laugh at certain comments, or take them seriously. Parts of the visual ""world"" was exceptionally magical, but it did not create a solid, homogeneous world like lets say Middle Earth in LOTR. It was not a bad try... but it fell to decent pieces, instead of forming a film.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Excellent fantasy film,  a must see.","I loved this film. Firstly, with the main set of actors being British, it brings a sense of realism into this fantasy story. With most films, American actors often come across badly, see through, and fake.But with Brits, they're more believable. That's why I think this film works. Danes does well in the part, her accent is very good, and she comes across well, Cox in his first major roll is excellent, and that goes for the rest of the Brit cast. Pheiffer is terrible I thought, her accent jumps a lot, and she's as wooden as ever, she has zero charisma and zero charm. The only reason I think they cast her is to make more American audiences see the film, as if DeNiro wasn't enough. A British actress would have been much better. As for DeNiro, I thought he was excellent, very funny in his roll. And as for the film as a whole, excellent, great soundtrack, storyline was good, and a lovely ending.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A gem of a film that get's it all just right,"Stardust is a little charmer of a film. Yes, the story has been told a million times before to you since as early as you can remember. But it's how it's told that matters and Stardust does such a lot to get this right.Great to look at visually, all the fairytale elements are wonderfully created with reference to everything from Shakespeare, classic European fairytale tradition, a brilliant airship very reminiscent of Hayao Miyazaki and a fair smattering of Lord of the Rings.The two leads are engaging and charming and I couldn't fault anyone's acting. I haven't read the books these are based on but there are enough fresh ideas in this magical universe to keep the storytelling engrossing.Kudos all round, this film manages to get it just right on almost every area that counts. If you think you might like this film by all means go to see it, you almost definitely will.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Star struck,"I have not seen a movie as good as this in a long long time. I've never been a one for witches and wizards, never been a Potter fan (probably something to do with making my name rather common), but this film was a perfect blend of humour, romance and magic. It is one of the few stories where I was not bored with the love connection, partly due to Claire Danes' ability to 'brighten' up all the romantic scenes. This movie was laugh out loud at times, which is very difficult thing to achieve with me. It looked like all the actors were having great fun making this film, and though not a Di Nero fan, in his role he was fantastic and showed versatility. This film will definitely be joining my DVD collection!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Really Good,"I liked this movie. I liked the fantasy because it didn't stay within the walls of our thinking. The acting was really good. The scenery is spectacular and sometimes ""other worldly"". Claire Danes is beautiful and talented. Charlie was good and I like how his character matured both physically, emotionally and psychologically. Michele Pfeiffer - oh what a makeup job they did on her! For one who is so pretty she interpreted ""ugly"", old, mean and decrepit really well. If it wasn't for Peter O'Toole's voice, I wouldn't have recognized him. The special effects were good and believable. This movie was delightful and I am sure I will watch it again in a few months and every year. I think it will stand the test of time too.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
the trailer didn't do it justice,"A welcome surprise! Despite the lackluster trailer and casting the unstellar-looking Claire Danes as Yvaine the Star , the movie came out as a well executed, entertaining adaptation of Neil Gaiman's book Stardust.It's wonderful how director/writer/producer Matthew Vaughn was able to sensitively add all the elements of fun, action, romance and suspense and still give the movie a GP rating. Of course, it lost the gore of the book but it's still a fantastic tale as well.It was well-written and well-cast except for Danes, who should've traded places w/ Sienna Miller instead. Charlie Cox, looking like a young Robert Sean Leonard, was endearing, while Robert de Niro and Ricky Gervais provided a lot of the laughs. Michelle Pfeiffer was indeed terrifying as an evil witch; it's unnerving how she can now allow herself to be portrayed that way.The pacing of the story was just right, the effects were not over the top, truly entertaining stuff!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Chaotic, Contrived, and Confusing","Stardust's downfall is that, in trying too much to be like old school fairy tales (Lord of the Rings and such), it carries the air of trying too hard. You can tell that it wants so bad to be the kind of classic fairy tale that everybody loves, but too much of it feels fake and pretentious, and there are several uselessly added layers that don't do much to enhance the story.The film begins with a deliciously wonderful voice-over by the incomparable Ian McKellen, who narrates throughout the movie, and is undoubtedly one of the best things about it. His soothing voice carries us to a small English countryside town whose wall borders on the magical land of Stormhold. A man journeys forth into the magical world, and 18 years later his son, Tristan (geez how fairy tale-ey can you get?) (whose mother resides in Stormhold) has grown up into a man who is in young puppy love with a rich girl who lives down the street. Alas, he cannot win her heart because he is a mere shop boy, but luckily for him, a star falls from the sky that he promises to retrieve for her in exchange for her hand in marriage. He journeys to the star, only to find that it is actually a fallen star named Yvaine, and together they must weather other people who are after them, including a devilish witch (a smart but underused Michelle Pfeiffer) and three sons of a recently dead king (Peter O'Toole in the best role of the movie) who must retrieve an amulet that will give whoever finds it kingship over all of Stormhold. Yeesh. If that plot isn't enough to show you how contrived and pretentious this movie is, let me continue.Stardust's greatest downfall is how much it believes that it is such a great tale of whimsy, fun, and fancy. But with such a convoluted plot (and believe me it gets convoluteder, er, more convoluted), there's no way it can claim to be a simple adventure. For starters, there are several things about the plot that should have been completely done away with. One is Robert De Niro's character of the gay pirate. Yes, I know everyone's raving about how he's playing against type and how great he is, but I don't really care. Once you get past the superficial ""ha ha ha he NEVER plays this type of character!"" there's not really much there, and the entire scene aboard his flying lightning harvesting boat (admittedly this is a pretty cool idea) is basically useless.Another useless point, however hilariously forgivable it is, occurs when De Niro sells his lightning to a trader, played by Ricky Gervais in, personally, my favorite moment of the entire movie, as Gervais milks the role for all it's worth, trumping, with three minutes on screen, De Niro's pirate effortlessly. Him, Ian McKellen, and Peter O'Toole are worth the price of admission all in themselves. The end result of the useless plot threads is a story that's so unnecessarily complicated that there's no way it can claim to be any kind of whimsical fairy tale. The extra plot threads wouldn't have bothered me if they had been woven into the tapestry of the movie enough to be unnoticeable, but they're so sloppily done the careless craftsmanship is almost unforgivable.Aside from the useless, sloppily done plot threads, another thing that bothered me was the anything goes use of magic. Supposedly, when the witch, Michelle Pfeiffer, I don't even remember her name, uses magic, it takes a toll on her borrowed youth so that she ages. So she uses magic several times, sparingly, of course, and when she does two bits of magic, both of her arms fade to withered skin dotted with age spots. Understandable, as both of these bits of magic weren't that large. But then she conjures an entire inn, complete with rooms, a bar, baths, a stable, a dining room, and everything you could possibly imagine in an inn. This doesn't take a toll on her at all, and it is never explained. Other instances abound. You might say, ""It's magic, it's not supposed to have rules!"" but if magic has no rules, then anybody could do anything, and then there wouldn't be much of an interesting plot, would there? And in the grand finale to the film, all previous supposed rules of magic are tossed out the window in favor of an over-the-top (albeit semi-visually impressive, if a bit derivative) climax.My other qualm with this movie is how its modern elements are completely disparate with its fantasy elements. When the star falls from the sky, we go up above the Earth and look down. What? This isn't sci-fi! Another way that this ""fairy tale"" rings false is how the characters easily jump into bed with one another as if they were part of the cast of ""Friends"", when the sleeping together does nothing to advance the story, and even detracts from it as the immediate physicality just reeks of lazy writing and a refusal to do anything new with this kind of storyline. It also diminishes the love the characters share for one another. Other amusingly ironic but ultimately too obvious pop culture references pepper the mix.Too often Stardust seems to be trying to be this grand sweeping epic movie, but then it will go into moments where it strains almost to the breaking point trying to whimsical and charming. It never mixes effectively the parts are too different and not woven well enough together to create anything reasonably entertaining. All this being said, though, it can be an enjoyable ride if not over-analyzed, but for me, its slipshod craftsmanship and poorly woven storyline were too much to really give it a good recommendation.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stardust Surefire Sleeper Hit,"So it's lurking way down the chart at the box office... So it's not flying at you from every angle in the form of trailers, TV spots, pop-up ads or street posters... So it's not one of the worlds most famous fantasy novels... But blimey it's a good film! Fast paced, snappy dialogue, exquisite setting, tongue in cheek humour, solid acting and, of course, the ever radiant Claire Danes. Layer all of that icing on top of the cake that is an uncommonly original story and it truly is amazing that more people aren't turning up in droves.I'm assuming that everybody has seen Superbad and the Bourne Ultimatum by now. Assuming that, I strongly suggest skipping spots 3-7 on the top ten list and heading straight for this ""diamond in the rough"" at number 8. Take your girlfriend, go with your mates, see it with your family; I doubt there is a man alive out there who would not find something to love in this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Most original story this summer -- and enjoyable too!,"Very pleasantly surprised by the movie -- it has steady pacing that neither drags nor speeds, and I found the story engrossing even if it is a fairy tale of sorts. Set design and art direction are perfect, as are the key characters... and how great is it to finally have a movie worth seeing that isn't a sequel to something else?! I do fear they've mis-pitched this movie in recent weeks, as it's as much a movie for the pre-teen crowd as anything else pushed directly at them, but like all really good family movies (Princess Bride comes to mind), adults will find plenty to like in Stardust as well -- which probably explains the recent ads and their 'more-grown-up' feel about the film. Well worth the trip to the cinema -- I suspect at the end of the year I'll remember this movie more than any of the others I've seen this summer.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A witty, wonderfully imaginative, and timeless tale, destined to become a classic","This remarkable film can be summed up very easily. First of all, while the comparisons to ""Princess Bride"" are inevitable, it's almost futile to do so. While both films combine adult wit and humor with a fairy tale backdrop, ""Stardust"" is so much different than any other fantasy/sci-fi film I've ever seen. It's such a hybrid of those genres, but its plot and script are so unique that--along with the performances, special effects, cinematography, and score--the finished product is simply not all that comparable to anything that has ever appeared on the silver screen. Secondly, the score is very effective at simultaneously pulling us into the story and the fantasy world in which it takes place and pushing the story along, while creating just the right amount of awe and excitement necessary to make the magic believable within the realm where the characters exist. Thirdly, I did not find the film to be even remotely difficult to follow or confusing in any way. In fact, the interesting interplay between the three main subplots actually made it even that much more compelling to watch. Wonderfully casted, and superbly acted across the board. This fantasy adventure (with sci-fi elements) was the best one I've seen since ""Return of the King"" (not that I am comparing the two at all). OK, so its not that easy to sum up, but don't let any crude and/or heartless and cynical review nor the film's pathetic PR prevent you from partaking in the best time you could have at the movies this summer (or even possibly in a long time)!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
absolutely tiring,"What happens when a young director (Matthew Vaughan of ""Layer Cake"") films the adaptation of the work of a successful writer (Neil Gaiman), tosses in a narration by a ""Lord of the Rings"" alum (Ian McKellen), spins one tale of a dying king (Peter O'Toole), another of a literal fallen star (Claire Danes), a young hopeless romantic (Charlie Cox), a love triangle, a transvestite on a flying boat (Robert DeNiro), and a Shakespearean trio of witches (headed up by Michelle Pfieffer)? We get ""Stardust"", a disappointing, tiring piece of cinema that wants to be ""The Princess Bride"" for the modern era, but seems much too busy tossing in a dozen more plot points than the standard two hour film. It makes for a very taxing viewing and none of the innumerable sequences ever make it worth the effort.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Best Fantasy Film I Have Seen in Years,"Wow.I just got back from a preview screening of Stardust, and I can't tell you enough how much I enjoyed it.Not since ""The Princess Bride"" has there been a film that blended humor, romance, action, adventure, drama, and fantasy so well. It was visually beautiful on screen, the actors were all perfectly cast, from big name stars to people I'd never heard of, and the story was compelling and original. It might be a bit much for younger children, as the evil of the villains is very clearly portrayed.This is hands down the best movie I have seen this year (sorry ""Knocked Up"", you had a good run). See it once, see it twice, tell your friends, pre-order the DVD. You will not be disappointed, unless you happen to hate movies with humor, romance, action, adventure, drama, or fantasy. If you hate those things, go see Daddy Day Camp, which I'm sure contains none of those elements.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Brilliant! A perfect 'relax and forget the world' movie,"Stardust is the kind of film that reminds you why you keep going down the DVD rental shop, buying Empire magazine and visiting this site: it's a gem that the majority of people will overlook, but everyone who takes the time to check it out will have an absolute blast. It might not have set the box office on fire, but cult devotion beckons, partly because of the Neil Gaiman connection, but also because it's one of those rare examples of script writing where everything fits into a cohesive whole. All the multiple plot strands are wrapped up neatly, the story takes it's time and is in no rush and despite the fantasy setting, Stardust is just as keen to laugh at itself as it is to enchant the audience.Set in ye olde England where the concept of stumbling into a fantastical world of Unicorns, witches, magic and flying boats is the start of a terrific adventure rather than a reality-blurring head trip, Stardust tells the story of Tristran Thorn (Charlie Cox), a likable but aimless country youth. Desperate to cop off with Sienna Miller's village bike, he crosses the wall that surrounds the town in order to find a piece of a star that's fallen to earth and return it to her as a demonstration of love. His efforts are waylaid however when the star doesn't turn out to be a lump of space rock, but a feisty Clare Danes who isn't exactly pleased to be a wedding present. Throw in an evil trio of witches (led by Michelle Pfeiffer) looking for the secret of youth and the dastardly Prince Septimus and Tristran's simple act of crossing a wall, picking up a rock and walking back turns into an epic adventure of romance, swashbuckling and fun.By now, with all this talk of Unicorns and such like, there's bound to be a few people out there whose eyes are rolling at the thought of yet another fantasy adventure clogging up the screens, but Stardust has an edge on the competition. Where the likes of Eragon relied on special effects and wide shots of the New Zealand countryside to enchant people and usually fell flat, Stardust concentrates on the story. The special effects are kept to a minimum and you're encouraged to pay attention to the one-liners and sparkling dialogue, rather than ogle hordes of sword wielding clichés. In this respect, Stardust's closest relative is The Princess Bride, a story that was shot through with a similar degree of knowing humour without jeopardising the central premise.Stardust in short, is a film tailor made for the Christmas television schedules. It transports you to another world and for over two hours, you can sit back, get swept up in it and forget about the mortgage, car insurance and the miserable next door neighbours that keep throwing mashed up watermelon slices onto your patio floor. With a cast that consists largely of British TV comedy regulars, it's no surprise that the sense of freewheeling fun never diminishes. It might be stereotypical, but this is no two dimensional children's movie, it's one the entire family can enjoy: toddlers, sulky teenagers, direction-less twenty somethings, parents and grandparents all.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
My rating: 10,"Rarely, very rarely, I give such high rating of a film. Maybe it can not reflect it fully but still it shows my willingness to represent it to you.It starts a little bit and untypical but this is what the fairy world of the fantasy, without which we can not, is. Because fantasy make us to dream what we want to see, to go beyond our limits - to emerge from the aquarium rather than sink into it and drown.Crucial moment: the heart of the damsel, crossing point for all human worlds. And man's, and woman's; of children, and of elder people; of the young and of the adult. Crossing point where only harmonizing balanced worlds can become one and create new world.Balance is also one of the movie's elements. Measured doze of humor, action, adventure, fairy tale and tension. In order of appearance it presented us a story of ghosts, witches, flying ship who's captain (one of the biggest) is a lightening strikes hunter.The audience also becomes a ghost because this movie comes to life in front of them without an interest of their existence. And that in this case is good because his majesty The-mentioned-above can fully transmit in it and dream on.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

This was a romantic(light)comedy in a fairy tale setting, it was unique in my experience and would make an interesting lifes story.

"truly, truly wonderful.. favourite movie this year!","Stradust, based on the novel by Neil Gaiman, follows Tristan as he leaves his own village to find a falling star, and win the love of Victoria. Meanwhile the sons of the late king are fighting and killing each other to be crowned while searching for a lost jewel. Meanwhile, A trio of witches also begin a hunt for the falling star....I've not read the novel, but the movie co-written by Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughn and directed by Matthew Vaughn is brilliant. The movie plays like a fairy-tale for adults, but at the same time, it subverts the genre, thanks to some brilliant writing, and some fantastic ideas and characters, brought to life by a stunning cast.Claire Danes as the star in human form is great, Michelle Pfeiffer (who hasn't been in movies recently), has great fun as one of the witches, Charlie Cox makes an appealing hero, Rupert Everett makes a small but memorable appearance as one of the kings sons hoping to be crowned king, but Robert De Niro steals the film with his turn as Captain Shakespeare a sky captain who catches lighting, while hiding a secret from his crew.The production design is impressive, the effects brilliant, and the humour in the movie is pitched just right. While the actual plot is fairly predictable in places, and you can almost guess the end after the first 10 minutes, I simply didn't care.As I sat watching it, there was a big smile on my face all the way through. I love fantasy movies, and this sits right up there with the Lord Of The Rings trilogy, and Pan's Labyrinth.There may be better movies this year, and this movie will probably be ignored come awards time, but this movie is my favourite movie of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Once upon a time..... Hollywood made movies like this,"Once upon a time, tales of princes, pirates, witches and unicorns used to captivate us. Sadly, those days departed with our childhood, however thanks to Stardust, you too can recapture the essence of those innocent bygone days of wonderment.Directed by Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake) and based on a graphic novel by Neil Gaiman, who also had a hand in penning the screenplay, Stardust is billed as a fairy tale for adults. The movie draws heavily on a multitude of fantasy influences, not the least of which are those spun by the Brothers Grimm. Complete with the aforementioned menagerie of fantastical players, perhaps the greatest spell this movie casts is the one it weaves over the audience.The story revolves around Tristan Thorne (Charlie Cox) who lives in the English town of Wall, so named because of the stone structure that lies on its border, separating the land's inhabitants from a mysterious realm where mortals are forbidden to enter  a land known as Stormhold. Of course, this didn't stop Tristan's dad from weaseling his way across years earlier; an event which led to Tristan's advent on the scene.Fixated upon winning the hand of the comely Victoria (Sienna Miller), Tristan pledges to cross the wall and bring back the remnants of a falling star seen shooting from the heavens into the land beyond, and from there Tristan's adventure begins.Upon arrival on Earth, the star takes the human form of Yvaine (Claire Danes) and her capture, by either the surviving sons of Stormhold's dying king (Peter O'Toole), or the evil witch Lamia (played with screen-eating aplomb by Michelle Pfeiffer) will yield the throne for the successful prince, or youth and immortality for the witch and her sisters.As Tristan's quest unfolds, he and Yvaine encounter a hoard of lightening-harvesting sky pirates captained by Robert De Niro, who practically steals the show with his comedic portrayal of a swash buckling swordsman with a secret passion for chiffon and the can-can - a performance that had me giggling like a schoolgirl throughout.Vaughn keeps the story moving forward at a brisk pace, never allowing things to get bogged down in sentimentality or overly drawn out scenes. In many respects Stardust hearkens back to Rob Reiner's 1987 movie The Princess Bride which also managed to find the perfect blend of comedy, fantasy and romance and wrap it all up in an enchanting fairy tale that could be enjoyed equally by young and old alike.With cameos by Ricky Gervais (The Office), David Kelly (Waking Ned Devine) and Rupert Everett, Stardust will envelope you in its charms and leave you feeling like a child all over again and reassure you that the sense of wonderment and enchantment still glows, even within the hearts of jaded adults.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Too much dust on this star ...,"I love science-fantasy movies more than virtually anything else! Aliens, terminators, gremlins, wizards, hobbits or Jedi ... I love to travel to other worlds full of weird and wonderful creatures. So naturally: as soon as I found out that ""Stardust"" was also going to be a fantasy film, my expectations ran very high. I ended up being somewhat disappointed because of two reasons. First of all: I expected too much. I thought this would be another dazzling film that would spawn many sequels such as ""Star Wars"" or ""Harry Potter"". Secondly and most importantly: this movie is a soft-hearted fairytale for children. There are no dark creatures or massive battles to be found. There is hardly even any magic at all; with the exception of three ugly witches doing what they do best. Thus the movie was not what I had anticipated.The make-up department of this movie surely had their work cut out for them for they had to turn Michelle Pfeiffer into an ugly witch. They did a great job seeing as how one of the most gorgeous women ever in Hollywood indeed looked unattractive in this film. Fortunately: we get to see a lot more of the original Michelle Pfeiffer than the transformed ugly one. Ever since her come-back, this is the second time in a row that the beautiful blonde plays an evil character (the first one was in the hilarious musical ""Hairspray"") and she clearly enjoys this change in her career. Another famous actor who stars in this fantasy film is Robert De Niro. He plays the part of Captain Shakespeare and both his character as well as his performance are quite something else and funny at the same time. There is also Claire Danes whom you may recognize from ""Romeo & Juliet"" and ""Terminator 3: Rise of the machines"". She plays the part of Yvaine - the fallen star who becomes the centre of everything that will occur in this movie.The storyline however is the cause for my discontent. It is so lifeless. It doesn't contain much more than a young man named Tristan searching for a fallen star and bringing it back as a present to the woman he loves. The entire movie shows us Tristan and Yvaine walking from the fantasy world to the human world. During their journey they encounter many mildly interesting characters. An extremely beautiful witch, a brave yet corrupt warrior who turns out to be one of 7 sons of the king and the only one who's still alive and a flying vessel full of pirates who desperately need to catch as much lightning as possible. The duel at the end of the movie is by far the most captivating moment; I believe. The rest of the movie is mediocre at best.Nevertheless: I found the sons of the king to be very entertaining. Virtually all of them had died and thus were mostly ghosts throughout this film. That's why they served as an audience delivering clever one-liners and always having a front row seat with everything that transpired in this movie. Unfortunately: such delights are few and far between and whilst this movie is probably entertaining enough, it is almost never really funny.In short: A perfect movie for children or anyone who likes cute and cheerful fantasy films that hold no darkness whatsoever. I, on the other hand, prefer more mature fantasy films that feature awe-inspiring battles as well as numerous ingenious creatures! The everlasting beauty of Michelle Pfeiffer is always a joy to watch and makes up for this!",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

spectacular!,"""Stardust"" is simply, timeless. There really aren't many current fantasy type movies that can hold a star to it... er, candle. Everything about it is sheer genius. There wasn't really much character development, but the acting made up for it. From the very beginning, it grabbed my attention and just kept going for the whole two hours. It's a movie you can watch over and over again and see something new every time. It made me laugh at, fear for and fall in love with the movie! I went in expecting nothing and came out shining. I can't wait for Stardust to come out on DVD, but till then, another $8.00 will be worth it to see in the theater a 2nd and maybe 3rd time.

First of all the characters are all either very well rounded and engage you completely (eg Claire Danes) or at the very least just great fun (Michelle Pfeiffer, Robert DeNiro).The story itself is very clever. On face value the plot is very simple, however it has several strands to it that all come together perfectly and in hindsight it is only the quality of the storytelling that makes the plot seem so straightforward.Emotionally the movie engaged me thoroughly. The love story element was balanced nicely with humour and as a result the film is both funny and romantic.Finally the action pieces are fast moving and imaginative and cleverly interwoven with the romance and the humour. (In some places all three aspects are strongly present at the same time).In short this is a spellbinding film. In many ways it is old fashioned storytelling at its best and yet this is one of the best 'modern' films I have seen in a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best parents  film since Hook..,"There are films that truly capture the imagination of a child, whatever age the child and there are adults that have long since lost that child-like wonder and no longer understand these films or that world. Then unfortunately, there are films made by these people - think ""Company of Wolves"", ""Chitty, chitty bang bang"", ""Hook"", that are meant to be children's movies but are really what some parents think should be good children's movies.Stardust falls in this category. Despite the special effects and high powered cast, it fails to evoke any sense of magic. I didn't buy into the fantastic world though I wanted to. Laziness, lack of attention to details, inconsistencies and too many self-indulgent moments (not as bad as Hook I admit), none of them fatal in themselves but put together make for a boring mess.Think of the children - and avoid...",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Imaginative tale, exceptional movie","I love movies! The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter I watched after I read the books and then re-read the books. Then I listened to all the books on CD. I just finished listening to Neil Gaiman read Stardust-magnificent, but not the same as the movie, there were some changes made, but that is not to say the changes were bad because they were fine, it is just that they filmed a variation of the story Neil wrote. And what a story, such imagination. I cannot fault a single performance. Claire Danes is a favorite of mine and I loved her performance, Robert DeNiro pulled no punches and was delightful, Nathaniel Parker is always worth watching, as Thomas Lynley, Gabriel Oaks, even that nasty character from Bleak House, Charlie Cox grew into a man right before my eyes, an outstanding job, I thought Peter O'Toole's performance, though short, was perfect. I look forward to seeing more of Charlie Cox. I have recommended this movie to everyone who will listen to me. It is a joy! It has it's dark moments, the witches are not very nice, but it is a rollicking good tale, beautifully filmed with an excellent score. Watch it and enjoy it and if you have the chance, listen to Neil read his story on CD, he does a wonderful job.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Great movie, great music, great acting","I would give this an automatic ten, but there are some faults which I will address later. This movie is most definitely for everyone, even though it is targeted towards adults. This movie's highlight I think is the music, perfectly in place with the on screen action (or romance) and is the perfect companion. The acting is top notch, and I must give Robert DeNiro a round of applause for his role. But, as with any movie,it has its faults. Some of the lines were delivered a little too forcefully, and also some inconsistencies which are too obvious detract from this gem. This is a must buy if you did not see this in theaters.

See this film...  and tell all your friends about it!,"In a year chock full of sequels and remakes, it was so refreshing to see this creative film!It has everything... action, suspense, comedy, charm, likable unique characters, great villains, twists, and a touching love story. It's fun for guys, fun for girls, and a great date movie too.The only thing it lacks is... effective marketing!It would be a MAJOR shame for people to miss this film, simply because it was not marketed properly.The only other thing I would say is that it would be pretty scary for kids under 8-9 (though I would have the same comment about Harry Potter, in which I heard kids crying their eyes out), and a lot of the humour might be over the heads of anyone not at least in their teens.Did I mention that you should see this film?

Great fantasy movie - Sadly overlooked & under recognized this summer.,"We saw a preview for this movie and waited for it to arrive in theaters. The summer came and went without a peep about it. I thought for sure it would be greatly publicized like other fantasy movies, especially with the cast list ( DeNiro, Pfeiffer, Miller ) It wasn't until I looked it up on IMDb that we realized that we missed it completely over the summer! We finally got to see it in February when it was on PPV. What a great movie! It had a little something for our whole family - romance, magic, humour, pirates, etc. It's so unfair that a great fantasy film can get lost in the shuffle amid the 'less than spectacular - but hugely promoted' movies of the summer. This movie will be one of our favourites I'm sure.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This Movie is NOT worth seeing....,"""Stardust"" was simply worse than mediocre. It was boring, convoluted, had ZERO character development, and partly because of these flaws, it was also overly long.It is one of those movies where nothing that happens is very interesting, because the viewer is not remotely invested in the characters and will not care in the least what happens to any of them. The story attempts to be different and imaginative, but ends up simply ridiculous and silly.I will not waste more time on this review.

"""Catch a falling star, put it in your pocket, save it  for a rainy day""","STARDUST is truly a magical film with a massive cast of wonderful actors and a performance from Robert DeNiro which is out of this world to see playing a character that lights up the screen with drama and a dash of devious humor that pilots the story forward. Michelle Pfeiffer, once again as in HAIRSPRAY, plays a nasty role which is such a change from her previous ""glam roles"" and she is in tip top form. Claire Danes continues to rise to the top as a ""real star"" and her English accent is superb.The sets, costumes, locations and the acting prove once again that along with a well written story magic can transform the screen as you see in STARDUST. However, perhaps Act Three might have been edited a tad shorter to reach the fairy tale climax, but as a whole STARDUST is a joy to behold.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Stars shine, .... brilliantly !!!","This being my first comment and review ever, it's an honor to write for a movie such as this. It has all the elements of a grand fairy tale - princes, princesses, witches and ordinary common human beings aspiring and dreaming of something better and of course the everlasting quest for unconditional love.The story is excellently paced; it warms your soul and takes it to a magical journey through a magical land where stars come to life literally. If you ever have chance to watch this movie don't hesitate and take it. It would be a perfect gift for someone you care for.As you can see I am tiptoeing carefully not reveal anything from this wonderful story, the magic presented is powerful and dismisses your disbelief right out the door. Besides who needs suspension of disbelief - it's a fairy tale! Plus the magical feats are not complete nonsense and are a just representation of many different spiritual cultures of the real world. Anyway it doesn't matter how much you know about magic, the story is wonderful and compelling and it won't let you go till the end.There is also a sufficient amount of good humor too. The camera and fictional landscapes as well as the special effects are so well put together that you will hardly even notice that they are special effects.The cast is perfect, starting from Michelle Pheipher, along with the two lead characters and ending with a ""notorious"" captain Robert DeNiro.To end this I'll just say this review in it self is completely obsolete and the only thing that I can say to you dear reader is to stop reading this review and go watch the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Lightning strikes.,"Stardust (2007) -This was a humourous delightful fantastic and great little Neil Gaiman story, turned film, full of epic moments and super casting? Have I run out of superlatives yet?A warmer to watch in the winter next to the Christmas tree and with a hot chocolate overflowing with cream and marshmallows, because it just had that heart and vibe of something to watch with the family, having something for everyone.There was even a grotesque element, a thread of horror that could have been grim, but was done cleverly not to upset.Think 'Hocus Pocus' (1993) mixed with 'Inkheart' (2008) mixed with 'Hook' (1991) and a hint of 'Harry Potter' (2001-11) because it was full of the same magical fantasy and adventure, but this time with a bit of romance too.In an attempt to win the heart of a girl, Tristan (Charlie Cox) went in search of a fallen star, but he didn't expect that star to be Claire Danes as the beautiful Yvaine or to find himself caught up with Witches and cruel Princes trying to prove their worth as the next King. The story that followed was inoffensive, interesting and delightful as well as great fun.Not one of the cast gave a bad performance, those that were exaggerated were meant to be and those that were meant to be more subtle did that well too.I did feel that Mark Strong in particular was a perfect choice for the King's seventh son Septimus. He delivered a brilliantly callous and driven character determined to win the throne and of course he is gorgeous.And Robert De Niro was charming as Captain Shakespeare. His shenanigans were even funnier because he was Robert De Niro delivering them (Before anyone tries to cancel me I mean the characters actions, not his nature).I hadn't actually watched it in years, but found it so easy to come back to and I wished that I hadn't left it so long. I'm not sure it needs to be watched yearly, because it might lose some charm through repetition, but I might add it to my list of films to watch every few years. It was a real feel good piece that couldn't possibly be hated by anyone.870.69/1000.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Captivating,"This is a fairy tale about fantasy, humor, and love. Rarely do we see these elements combined together in a movie this way. There are usually always war and slaughtering involved to tell the tale/story in a fantasy world.With all the wrongs going on in our world, this is just what we need. A love story that will make the human heart tingle with warmth, and respect love for what it is, something truly amazing.... And maybe, just maybe we can all learn something from it.I mainly concern myself with the story in any tale, whether a movie or a computer game. Graphics/effects etc are not so important to me. So here are some of my character remarks:Claire Danes: Is absolutely adorable as Yvaine. Cute, funny and vulnerable to the new world she finds herself in.Charlie Cox: I can't say very much about him since i've never seen him in a movie before. But he is perfect for the role.Robert De Niro: Is a good as always, complementing on his comedy streak from his Meet the parents performances, which i personally like.Michelle Pfeiffer: I always knew she had a mean streak when i first heard her say ""I'm Catwoman"" in Batman Returns. She excels in her role as villain.Ian McKellen: Is a great actor/voice actor and brings a softness to the prologue and epilogue with his soft/English-accent voice.Supporting Actors: Also very well cast, no complaints here.Deepest respect to the writers of this wonderful story, and the director for making this a warm, and lovable movie to remember for a long time to come.May you all live happily ever after.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
feel good movie,"when i heard of this movie i thought to myself oh great another fantasy movie, that's what we need (i didn't like LoTR that much because of the actors portraying the hobbits, i was cheering for sauron, and i found the dialogues sometimes very lame "" let this be the day we draw swords...."" give me a break, then i heard de niro is in it and i thought this can be good. again after a few days i had a change of heart until i saw the high rating on IMDb and i decided to see it. after the first 45 min i was thinking that it really is a piece of crap, i realized how good it is once it ended. i thought it was a piece of crap in the beginning because it's different from everything i have ever seen, it is just great. LoTR was a great movie, but not that original, this is like nothing out there. plus at the end of the movie it makes you feel good, about everything. this sounds really gay i know, but it is really a feel good movie with great acting, great directing, great soundtrack and a great idea. go see this movie, you wont be sure, trust me, go see it with your girl and it will make her see you with different eyes.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A great adaption,"As a fan of Neil Gaiman's book on which this film is based, I was very excited about this film's release and simultaneously expecting a let down. The film was very satisfying though, and one of my favourites this year.Set in the town of Wall and the fairytale world of Stormhold adjoining it, Stardust is the story of Tristin Thorn, a young man prepared to go to unusual lengths to prove himself to the woman he loves.Tristan crosses into Stormhold to retrieve a fallen star for his intended sweetheart, but his quest is complicated by a number of other interested parties - including a trio of powerful and deadly witches hoping to regain their youth, and the Lords of Stormhold battling it out for succession to the throne.The story mixes adventure, humour and emotion to great effect, and it is enjoyable to see how disparate threads become woven together.Reader's of Neil Gaiman's book can expect a number of changes from the original story, but the charm of the novel still abounds here. Besides, I was to busy laughing to be concerned with adaption blasphemy.Expect top-notch performances from all the cast. Claire Danes in particular surprised me with a spot-on portrayal of Yvaine.All in all highly recommended, but go easy on the soda as this film is fairly lengthy.A last minute addendum - don't be put off by the dodgy Take That song in the promos, I promise you will not have to hear this until the credits.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great fantasy - superb characters,"Loved it, and had to stay right through the credits to listen to Take That's 'Rule the World'. A rip roaring adventure with many a humorous line. Great cameos from the likes of Ricky Gervais (The Office) and Mark Williams (Mr Weasley in Harry Potter). Good parts also played by Michelle Pfieffer and Robert De Niro. It was a real story not a bunch of effects but there were enough effects to take you out of this world and into Stormhold the world beyond the wall. A true laughing out loud film which uses subtle humour and not profanity to titillate the audience.Its rated PG in UK but only as scary as any fairy tale so most kids would lap it up. Iwould recommend this to anyone who wants to escape the toil of daily living and who still has the heart of a child",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Great adventure, even for adults","I watched the movie without really expecting much from it. Actually, I was expecting a mish-mash of celebrity cameos, glitzy but pointless special effects, and a weak story. But I was completely wrong! This is a rollicking romp of a romantic fantasy, full of charm and wit. It's a story and setting that might seem more suited for children, but completely sparked my imagination as an adult. Many fantasy movies, especially ones adapted from books, fail to capture the world that the author imagined and created. But this one succeeded wonderfully--the atmosphere, the characters, even the political nuances, seemed real and believable.Michelle Pfeiffer was excellent as the wicked witch, and Clair Danes made a lovely Star. Sure it was maybe just a little sappy at times, but it made me feel good after watching it.A great surprise. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"But of course! Nothing says ""romance"" like a kidnapped injured woman!","Comparisons to the Princess Bride are inevitable, but unlike PB this movie does not break the fourth wall. In Princess Bride much of the humour comes from in-jokes with the audience, parody of the genre, and knowing caricature. PB comes off as a sort of audience-participation experience.Stardust does not come out of the screen to meet the audience, it draws the audience into the world. We watch as a world of wonder unfolds, just a short walk from Victorian England. The story is of a naive village boy's growth into a man, and the lengths he goes to to win true love.Direction is for the most part smooth and natural and the film flows beautifully apart from the intro (though I think there was a technical problem in the theatre). The real genius here is that the moments of comedy never compromise the drama of the situation. The scenes in the Inn are a great example of tense crisis perfectly interwoven with a number of hilarious sub-plots. This is British humour at its best - humane, warm, unexpected, and present even in the darkest of situations.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Magnificent,"First of all, I ain't hardcore fantasy or die hard fairy tales fan, but this one is something that i should see long time ago.

This movie has, a little bit of everything hold up in one (Meredith Brooks??? wtf). Scene and the act of De Niro is some outstanding performance but he is not the best actor in this one, actually i think none is.

A Completely Different Tale from the Book,"I finished reading the book yesterday, which I absolutely adored. It was one of those books that unassumingly wraps itself around your heart and palpitates your imagination back from the choking state it can find itself in after drowning a few days in the banality of a rather mundane life that most of us live. Suffice it to say it was a good book.So, like a complete and total eejit, I decide it might be a good idea to go and watch the 2007 adaptation of said book. Now, by 'might' I mean 'most definitely believed it to be' and by 'good idea' I mean 'was ensorcelled by the stupidity of said notion enough to convince myself of such.'Now I've known, as most modestly intelligent folk these days do, that the adaptations of books by Hollywood are often deviant (to say the least) from the original story and in some cases must be altered entirely, in bits and parts, in order to expedite a story line into the limited time-frame allotted by production budgets, run times and the very shrinking attention span of the average consumerist viewer. But never, in all my years and in my wildest imagination, did I ever conceive of an adaptation so wholly different from it's source material that I found myself chanting the the acronym 'wtf' like a Benedictine Monk chanting the Breviary. The movie was almost entirely devoid of everything contained within the pages of the novel. The only similarities, and dare I not say that without qualifying it with the notion that I am using the term 'similarities' loosely, were the names of the characters and a few (very, very, few) plot points.The entire endeavor was like that of an apprentice mage fumbling around his masters book of spells and attempting to produce a complex Simulacrum but instead creating a deformed homonculus, or a badly rotted Golem.That being said..If you like your stories to start where they end, to give little concern for Character development, to rush the plot lines along at an exponentially rushed pace and to trade all of these for attractive actors/actresses and dynamic special effects, not to mention trading ALL THE MAGIC for poorly executed humor, then this is most definitely the movie for you.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Stars fell on Wall,"But it's okay. Stardust is a fun, optimistic romp that doesn't take itself too seriously. The storytelling is rich and intriguing, and all of the characters play their roles with genuine relish and exuberance.The plot has some holes, the movie drags in places, and the score is unspectacular (to say the least) but none of this was enough to ruin the very palatable 130 minute film (not so long, in this age of LOTR and Harry Potter films pushing or surpassing 3 hours.) Of course the film isn't as epic as LOTR, but nor does it borrow heavily, stylistically or narratively.I never read the 200-odd page novella the film is based upon, but I felt like this was a case when the story did not suffer from the conversion in the way a 700 or 800 page fantasy novel inevitably does. This is not a fantasy film for everyone. Whereas no one ever breaks a smile in LOTR, and even when jokes are told they're stilted, Stardust is very much a film of casual conversation, which really brings the film down to earth. Ominous portents and portentous ominations spouted by deep-throated she-elves is all well and good, but its cold; detached (incidently, Sir Ian McKellan provides a few minutes of narration in the opening and closing, but that's it.) That brings me to the sizable cast. I thought I would hate the protagonist, Tristan (Charlie Cox) but he wasn't that bad. He and Claire Danes have the chemistry required for the love story. Danes is extremely watchable as the extremely blonde fallen star whose attitude towards Tristan starts out as hilarious loathing, but evolves, as it must. Sienna Miller, Peter O'Toole, and Ricky Gervais, while all competent, play admittedly small roles. The main antagonists, the witch (Michelle Pfiffer) and the selfish prince (Mark Strong, from Sunshine) are not the deepest characters in the world, nor are they implacably dim-witted and boring; they were entertaining villains. And I cannot forget Captian Shakespeare (Robert DeNiro), the Sky Pirate with a secret. A virtuoso performance. After crap like Meet the Fockers, its great to see him in a role that was undoubtedly tough to pull off without looking like and idiot, or like young Vito Corleone. Of all the supporting characters, he's the most...complex.I was expecting to see a film that unfolded like a Final Fantasy game. You have kings and princes, mages, fences, knights, airships, and a really really tall, elaborate, cool-looking royal city. And you have the whelpish everyman whom you control and run around the world map from place to place, having to deal with lots of stuff along the way, and growing in the process. In many ways, the film didn't disappoint on that level, and probably wouldn't be a bad basis for an RPG.That's not a bad thing in my opinion. The film has a great mood to it, and a very unique feel that I can't quite put my finger on. But it was quite entertaining, even if it wasn't nonstop kinetic action, there was enough going on to stay interested. Like I said, the music wasn't great It may not be revolutionary, but has its fair share of original ideas, so I'd recommend it as a fresh take on fantasy films. Go check it out.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Unexpected,"I must admit, when my room-mate brought this DVD into my flat I felt like shooting someone. I mean, something so seemingly childish had no place in my collection. But after a long slug-out, I was 'persuaded' to watch this movie, but the man in me must admit, its a bloody good movie! The acting was rather good and De'Niro was just plain fantastic!He managed to go from blood-thirst pirate to dress-loving pirate in one scene. The story line was rather simple, and was a nice change from modern-day film's up and down, left and right stories. The movie was both funny, romantic and there was even a morale to the story!

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder...,"Even considering the risk of being accused of plagiarism I cannot help but think that the summary I mentioned is perhaps the best thing to be said about this movie. I can not blame the side that chooses to discredit the film, nor the other one. I find that, in order to appreciate this film you need to have the kind of spirit that still believes in fairy tales, as long as they aren't exaggerated and do not give you the exact feeling that they are what they're supposed to be... not real. The movie, if compared to masterpieces of the fantasy genre does not excel through anything. However it provides a well cooked recipe of different stereotypical fantasy elements as well as a handful of original ones, while not wearing out the prior. It manages to stop things exactly when you believe they are going to become corny, provides laughs in the most unexpected of situations, and makes you leave the cinema with a warm feeling in your heart. At least that's the kind of impression left on most of the people I've talked to after they saw the movie. The acting isn't excellent (except for Robert De Niro's portrayal of a fairly gay captain :)) ), however it delivers as it should, and doesn't end up being lackluster in certain areas. The fighting scenes, although rare are very entertaining and fun to watch, especially the concept of a corpse being controlled via a voodoo doll. However I will stop the foolish analysis of all the separate elements of the film because the quality lies in the sum of its parts, not in the individuality of them. All in all, the first impression that the film left on me was that of a pleasant surprise, when I realized that decent adaptations of fantasy books can still be made. If you enjoy fairy tales that end with a happily ever after, without exaggerating it, then this is the movie for you. If you fall in the other category, you might still enjoy the film as a general experience.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Odd adaptation of Gaiman's story,"This picture couldn't seem to find the right bits to adapt from Neil Gaiman's original story. Gaiman's version is much more adult-oriented (showing the sex between two characters, for instance).Overall the film is ""family friendly"" but it has some graphic elements and bad characterizations that I don't think are appropriate for kids.The male lead is an Orlando Bloom stand-in but does an adequate job of playing the earnest and unlikely ""hero on a quest."" Claire Danes is, well, Claire Danes. Robert De Niro does the worst acting of his career in his completely unbelievable ship captain's role.There are a few poignant moments in the picture but overall I found it oddly jumpy and unable to settle into a coherent storyline. Not one to see again.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Thoroughly enjoyed it....,"... as much as any movie I've seen this year. I'm a big Neil Gaiman fan, but have not read the book yet (I have the comic on my nightstand - will start it now). Noticed that some fans were disappointed in the liberties taken with the story, but my understanding is that Gaiman had final say over the changes, so I'll give him the respect due the author and view it as another take on the same material. DeNiro was a hoot - he played it thisclose to over-the-top, but held back just enough to create a real character instead of a caricature.All in all, it's been an exceptional year for fantasy (at least for me). ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" ""Children of Men,"" ""Paprika,"" ""Order of the Phoenix,"" and now this. The trailer for ""Beowulf"" looked promising, and the screen writing combination of Gaiman and Roger Avary gives me goosebumps. Just hope Zemieckis doesn't serve us up a bunch of CG-animated corpses like he did in ""Polar Express."" Honestly, the character animations in that were flat-out creepy - looked like they'd been made up by an inexperienced undertaker and attached to marionette strings.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

There is absolutely nothing to complain about.The casting was good, the script was good, the continuity was good, the ending was good. Everything about it was good.Robert DeNiro practically stole the show with his scenes. I don't want to go into it, because it would ruin the enjoyment.At certain points of the film, I felt some shades of ""Princess Bride"". Not in plot, but in styling. Much of the dialogue and the chemistry is very reminiscent of that book/film.I just can't stop smiling, cause I just really really enjoyed this film. What was nice about it too was that it was original. It wasn't a rehashed follow the formula sequel. A lot of people said that it was like Shrek for grownups. That is rather odd, cause if you think about it, Shrek was for grownups in the first place.But if I had to compare it to something that already exists I would say this; It's a little of the above mentioned Princess Bride, with a touch of the Tenth Kingdom, and a twist of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory...just a twist mind you...I know some people whined that it didn't hold up to the book... Quite frankly I never read the book, but do plan on purchasing it, and reading it. However if anyone in their right mind ever thinks that a movie is going to be everything the book was especially in the 21st century, then that person is either deluded, or does not see very many movies. Besides most people never even knew that this was a book to begin with until it was made into a movie, so quit complaining.It was a great film, with a great story, who cares if it didn't follow every little action and what not... Besides from what I have read of the ending of the book vs the ending of the movie, I prefer the movie ending rather than the typical dramatic bittersweet ending of the book...so nya >8-PMy wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and will most definitely buy it when it comes out on DVD.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A great fairy tale for adults,"I really enjoyed this movie, especially because the trailer did not gave a away too much of the story. So I had a really good time while watching this movie and I'll recommend it too each who wants to have a good laugh and fantastic adventure mixed up with a lovely romance.The mix of the various influences is great and the casting crew did a great job. Every single role is well played. Robert deNiro and Michelle Pfeiffer must have had a good time while shooting this movie. Both seem to enjoy there role very much, so the audience get the feeling that they inspirit there characters.I also like to see much more of Charlie Cox, hopefully he doesn't drift into the cliché role of the young adventure.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Unexpected perfection,"I didn't know what the movie was about when I started watching it.My first reaction: oh no... not one of those fantasy fairy tale movies.But I couldn't turn it off. And 20 minutes later, I couldn't stop if I wanted to. When it comes to this genre of movie, it has it all: a super story line, a great cast peppered with unexpected ""names"", and in the end, a roaring, never-let-go, predictable yet 100% satisfying tale.Excellent direction, top notch production values, a satisfying and well performing cast.Stardust is near perfect. And if you allow yourself to enjoy it, you too won't be able to turn away until the credits roll.One of the best in this genre - it will be in my top 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
My personal favorite of '07,"Normally, I don't let it slide when movies aren't very faithful to the books they are born from - but this is most definitely an exception. Most movies that don't follow their books tend to have continuity problems, and are plagued by bad screenplay. Stardust as a movie, however, flows particularly well and has a mass of beautiful special effects to accompany it.Take it from a movie addict, this movie is worth watching based on how visually captivating it is alone. Another perfect example of how advanced technology is making watching movies even more unforgettable.Of the movie's admirable qualities there is the skill level of the actors and actresses. I must applaud them all! Not one character was introduced that I didn't love (or at least love to hate). Charlie Cox and Claire Danes worked well together on screen and had few flaws to speak of - but truly, Michelle Pfeiffer just about stole the show! I've no doubt that most everyone will also enjoy the stories of the Princes of Stormhold (at least what's left of them), Captain Shakespeare, and a certain unlucky trader.I don't want to give away too much on these characters - I wish you all to be as pleasantly surprised as I was. I'll just say that you will definitely not be bored, and this is a movie I will watch over and over again!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stardust,"When I watched this movie for the first time it was like seeing a fantasy movie that was actually more fantasy for a change and not convoluted by too much romance, too few villains or over the top effects that were placed in a part to fill space. The performances in this movie were wonderful, and didn't reek of reading from a board or being too over practiced. The cast meshed naturally and didn't feel the need to act as if they really were just acting for a film. The ideas of the story were great too, and they really stuck to the book. I'm also happy that they used cynical humour if you will, rather than humour that was too obvious or complex. The emotions that the characters also portrayed were not those of a soap opera, but believable enough to be put into everyday life. When Claire Danes confesses her love for Charlie Cox, it was so cute because he was a mouse in that bit and she was a star who claimed to be cynical about love. Also Claire is absolutely stunning and manages to be a good actress without making other females get wildly irritated with her because she obviously sold her looks rather than developed her acting. Charlie was so sweet too, he portrayed boyish charm and innocence, as well as being slightly inexperienced in many areas without seeming too dim. Sienna Miller was lovely as the stuck up love of Charlie's life, perfect as the girl in the small village who is beautiful and has been spoilt by obvious attention from every male this side of the seven seas. Micheal Phiffer was absolutely superb as the wicked witch, managing to be beautiful and hideous in the movie and still make me laugh. And the cast of brothers were so hilarious that the fact that they each had a hand in one another's demise didn't make me utterly shocked and stuck on that matter. Peter O' Tool was very funny as the father too in his cameo. I am absolutely in love with this film all round! I went to see a fantasy and also got love, adventure, drama, dark comedy, and I wasn't so bored that I could guess every line the actors would say before hand and also expect a happy ending from the get go! It was also refreshing to see Robert Di Nero as a transvestite pirate! What more can you possibly hope for in a movie? Trust me previews and trailers and teasers of this film do not do it justice!!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Impeccable work of high fantasy empowers the genre and showcases a great array of international talent!,"Nutshell: Fun, endearing and exciting movie. High quality entertainment which I will be returning to very soon with equal anticipation.Having not had what I can imagine is the pleasure of reading Gaiman's novel before seeing this film, I entered the cinema with an entirely open mind. Arguably without the dynastic nature of Tolkien, Rowling or Pullman's stories being imposed upon the source material it perhaps would have had less bearing anyway. The fans can be the greatest threat to an adaptation so with some relief I can avoid the concerns of whether or not it was a faithful conversion.Overall I can only say that this, from any critical angle, was a tremendous film. Naysayers of the fantasy genre will frankly have to keep their traps shut; if you don't like fish, don't eat it. Stardust is a wonderful experience visually and emotionally, with an entirely appropriate and enjoyable score/soundtrack to support it. The story itself keeps an excellent pace and absolutely epitomizes the wonderful nature of fantasy, with a diverse array of intelligently conceived, multidimensional characters. It doesn't dwell on irritating issues like the acceptance of unusual circumstances by our protagonist Tristan but most importantly is coherent and comes about full circle. Really a very great job by the screenwriters and presumably initially Gaiman. The beautiful motif of the worthlessness of eternity without love runs subtle and yet strong throughout.Every actor is a delight to watch on screen, from the main characters to the supporting roles. The British audience will see a myriad of nationally renowned stars, many of whom are pushing the international forum with continuing success, as well aided by this film. Charlie Cox stands out strongly and brightly in his debut lead, an excellent performance. Claire Danes and Michelle Pfeiffer are marvelous and even further refute the long standing taboo of Americans attempting English accents. The character of Septimus (well played by Mark Strong) as with chief villain Lamia (Pfeiffer) both have much superior depth to most film antagonists, a rare treat, and Sienna Miller portrays the bratty village beauty perfectly. And De Niro... oh De Niro.. thank you. I shall say no more of him. It was perhaps a little cheeky giving McKellen (narration) and O'Toole primary billing but regardless both castings in their respective roles were a nice touch, as were every recognized face from Gervais to Everett to Fleming, Fletcher and Williams... (deep breath), and more! The audience loves a cameo, especially when it doesn't appear exploitative and by intelligent management of character involvement, Stardust also avoids the ensemble cast effect.In closing, another strength was the elegantly applied use of CGI and Spectacle (with a capital S). In the wake of the sword and sandals/epic fantasy boom we've seen a number of films rely heavily on grand set pieces that usually lack enough creativity to make up for other deficiencies in story or acting (how many can you name?). Stardust spares us the ordeal of a mighty battle or vast employment of special effects, rather choosing to let the characters and well timed pace keep you riveted. This is not to say you will leave feeling cheated for oohs and ahs moments. When they come they are expertly executed and the violence can and probably will catch you off guard at times.Stardust comes with my highest praise, I would recommend it to anyone. Let's see if the Golden Compass can keep the ball rolling for fantasy!!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best,"I just want to say that i think this is the best, most beautiful movie of all time and its totally worth watching. Now i don't want to spoil the experience for anyone but i can say it's full of love, humor and action, it makes a great adventure for any day. The humor spikes several times and you cant help laughing out loud. Except from some minor goofs, such as non-synced audio-video during a minute the film is pretty goof free too, and i have seen my share of bad movies. The actors are all great, how it would have been with other actors we'll never know but i don't think Stardust could get any better though. I was deeply touched several times during this film. You have not seen a good movie until you see Stardust, try it.Ten out of 10 starsp.s if anyone knows any movie like this please tell me",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Faster than light,"Two hours passed by like the falling star and brought me to the world, where everything is possible. All the actors are so sympatic that even the acts of bad characters are somehow hidden in comedial mist and nothing bad can make you hate them. Magic of love, shining of stars, beautiful locations of Scotland, Wales, England and even Iceland are carrying you away to the world over the wall, where death is a funny thing, but hatred is something you can't trust in....The movie draws you in and you forget about time...you are smiling like a small child and feel that warm and kind atmosphere, which reminds you, that love rules the world and is the biggest of all of powers and even the fantastic magic.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
dull....,"Blimey,How very VERY bland this film is. It must have done wonders for the tourist trade to the lake district, however, it seemed to miss the mark in every twist and turn...i think it failed because it just wasn't odd enough, it sorta had it... but not quite....I couldn't quite believe how dull and dreary and absolutely underexciting it was........................... oh how the hours dragged so badly....ohhhhhhhhhhh...Can't we do any better than this?........... probably not.....",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Brilliantly done,"Really brings out the meaning of love as a word, a true love story...a classic. The story is absolutely beautiful and the acting is funny at nobody's expense. The killing is sort of sudden - everyone gets pushed down a cliff or stabbed in the chest without much thought; I thought that added a lot to the affect of the movie, as did the ghosts. Danes' acting was superb and the movie pulled off a great balance of action comedy and romance. I think I enjoyed this movie also because the female actresses were not overly gorgeous or overdone (being a guy, I don't know if the same goes for De Niro) but the charisma of the characters is what creates that ethos a person will feel during the movie. It was definitely one of the best movies I've seen this year.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Grown up magic and fantasy for the Adult child within,"In the mid 2000's my teenaged daughter was interested in media /arts at school,and occasionally would request a trip to cinema to cover
a report on movies for media studies.At that time of my life,any sort of escapism from domestic chores and work stuff was welcome...
A revelation the film,it introduced me to Neil Gaiman's novels,I always read the original source if I'd enjoyed the film.Surprisingly the producer director Matthew Vaughan, offspring of his famous father actor who had starred in man from uncle,and magnificent seven ,,is also resident in East Anglia,another converted Anglophile.Any way a delightful now and again rewatch, with a stellar cast, those who are still on the planet,and still working in movies and the arts.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not a fan of fantasy but still enjoyed it,"I thought this movie was quite fun, good story and acting, and you can't help but feel good after leaving the theater. The teenagers in the audience seemed to find some of the romantic parts a bit too much to bear, but I find them quite well done and not too over-the-top as they can often be.The story itself is indeed fantasy, so you need to suspend your disbelief, or just be a natural fan of the fantasy genre. I never loved any of these types of films, even Lord of the Rings was a bit hard for me to get into, but the story and acting (DeNiro is fabulous) make it hard not to recommend this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
the best,"i didn't want to see stardust originally but my brother rented so i figured i'd watch it until i got bored. in stardust, i never got bored. we were talking about how this movie would be in our top 5 then as it went on we said top 3 movies. when the movie was all over and after we had seen the end, i asked my brother what other movie was better than stardust. there is no other better movie than stardust that i've seen. this would get a 100 out of 10 if i had my way. it was funny, the actors were hot, and the whole story-line was hilarious. i couldn't get over the boy, he was gorgeous. i'll be looking for him in many movies to come. Claire Danes is also stunning, and she just keeps up her reputation of being in good movies and acting wonderfully in all of them. i was also pleasantly surprised by Robert De Niro's character. i loved stardust.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A magical tale with twists and surprises at every turn,"It's a long story, as one often says, but in this case, the ride is well worth it. Stardust is a wonderfully inventive fairy tale, filled with twists and surprises at every turn. If you enjoy movies like Ladyhawke, then you will like this one even more. And for a film that is just 127 minutes long, it sure packs a lot. The engaging storyline, accompanied by a rousing score, unfolds like a gift being teasingly unwrapped; and by the end, the package is neatly tied-up again, topped off with a resplendent bow. Young Charlie Cox leads a starry cast, and they all gamely deliver deliciously off-beat performances. Stardust is a visual feast, and a tale that satisfies both the mind and the heart.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Suitable for kids only,"I saw a very good rating and some good comments about this movie and because I saw IMDb has compared it to ""The lord of the rings"" which is one of my favorites, I decided to buy this movie but as an adult I didn't like it very much. In my opinion and as a person who likes fairy tales it's not comparable with the Lord of the rings at all! some films are suitable for kids only and I guess we need to mention it in our comments. In this movie the story is poor,acting isn't brilliant neither the special effects.I don't know why Robert De Niro participated in this movie! I'm one of his fans but even he couldn't save the movie, may be it's a nice movie for kids but not for adults.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An unfortunate change of events (from the book),"Being a great fan of Neil Gaiman I expected something more like the book... Have to say this is my favorite book! However, the changes from the book were at many times distasteful to the original feeling of the book. From being a mastery of writing this movie left me unsatisfied with mainly the changes of the plot as to the end, the character of Una, the romance parts and the acting abilities of Yvaine... In some points towards the end it reminded me of the movie ""Sweet November"" in a ""love conquers all"" kind of way which trust me, was not good...So, my main question is... why not trust the (original) writer? My hypothesis on that would be that nothing is to be left for thinking or implied - much like a ""fast food"" movie... What a pity for such a masterpiece of a book!Just to be fair, I have to add that Robert De Niro is absolutely brilliant in delivering his character!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Fantastic story, combined with love and today's humans","I had seen the movie not before anyone, or with a premier, but rather later than everyone I guess. The movie was released in the beginning of 2007 and it has been 9 months when I first had the chance to see it. The story was first a kind of interesting but regular stories; at least it seemed so in the beginning 30 minutes or something. However, when the star had hit the other side of the Wall, it began to seem interesting. I will not talk about the content, most of the people who are reading these will probably have seen the movie. But what is really good about Stardust is first the combination of the actors, both young talents and the experts meet up in the movie. In addition to the combination of these actors, although the movie passes in a fantastic world in a non existing kingdom; the idea is simple. It basically represents the greedy, power hunger people around the world and those who are pushed hard by these people. At all, I really recommend you guys to see it if you have not, the effects are well done, the actors are fantastic (especially Robert De Niro while dancing in a woman's dress and while serving meals and drinks to the two others) and the idea beneath makes me think about today's worlds of power...",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not your typical Fairy Tale,"Star Dust turns out to be more than a fairy tale, it's a STAR tale and it is indeed a star movie to catch. I had gone to the cinemas expecting a break from the typical school stress just before the winter break and I was rewarded with more than what I had expected from it.Yes it has a happily ever after ending, that was just part and parcel of a huge and well-plotted fairy tale production. More than that, Star Dust featured budding leads and had a strong supporting cast. The animations were superb. Their costumes were very detailed and elaborate (you know how mundane magical characters costumes can be). The dialogs were engaging. The characters were very nicely characterized, I have to admit I even felt for the bad characters at some point in the movie. Star Dust had indeed brought me on a ride for the full 2 hours.If you want a taste of fantasy but felt that stories such as Die Hard have a plot too real for such, Star Dust will be a good movie to satisfy your craving for an action-packed, fun-loving fantasy that don't just end with a happy ending but also a smile on your face. Highly recommended to watch it with your loved ones!WQ",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Overlooked,"It's too bad this film was overlooked both in award nominations and in recognition from others. It was also overlooked in the theaters because it was only shown for about 2 weeks I think. This film is imaginative, beautifully photographed, well-acted, and just plain entertaining. It has humor, suspense, action scenes,romance, and more. How did this gem get through without a lot of hype,and without any nominations for awards? It has a lot of good people in it  and the part Robert DeNiro plays, he does SUCH a good job at.

Robert De Niro Needs To Go Find Billy Crystal,"Robert De Niro needs to go find Billy Crystal--""I go fag, you die"" (and only for his mafioso character do I permit and forgive the use of the word fag). I think dancing in a tu-tu with a fan sends De Niro into a flaming fit of flair and glamor that will have the audience dissolving in giggles. In addition to De Niro's massively entertaining parade, the film is a winner. It addresses love, and how more often than not people are more in love with the idea of being in love than actually being in love. It explores the path that one must follow towards self-knowledge, and it blooms in its charm, lovely cinematography, and the beautiful fairy-tale sway of the plot. Clair Danes is positively luminescent as the Star, and Charlie Cox is a charming take on the hero of Neil Gaiman's novel. Overall, while the story itself is another fairytale of a faraway place that perhaps cannot meet the epic battles of others, it is a sweet, blissful escape that brings you back to earth feeling content with the belief that every once in a while you truly can catch a falling star.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A beautiful, magical and wonderful story..","Stardust stayed with me long after i watched, enthralled, the first time. Claire Danes is one of my favourite actresses and her portrayal of Yvain is magnificent. Yvain is punchy and feminine. The best kind of heroine. Throw in Robert De Niro, Michelle Pfeiffer and Mark Strong and the strength of each performance pulls the eager viewer through various unfolding plots.On so many levels Stardust was more than i was expecting. Less Disney and more labyrinth, less twee and goofy, somehow more solid and totally enchanting.The combination of a stellar cast, some of the UK's finest comedians and the surprise of a relatively unknown but undeniable talent in Charlie Cox - who comfortably handles the male lead - Stardust is both genuinely comedic and engaging. A very satisfying adaptation, Gaiman obviously knew who to trust.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Star Rises From the Dust,"Once upon a time there was an author by the name of Neil Gaiman who decided to dazzle us all by presenting us to a magical world unlike any other we'd ever seen. In this world there was magic and fairies, witches and pirates. There was everything you could ever want in a fantasy. He named it Stardust.Eight years later, Paramount Pictures Movies Production Company hired director Matthew Vaughn to bring to life this fairytale for the big screen. A tremendous job since the book was so beautifully written and eloquently told. With a limited budget he was to create a movie with outrageous special effects, spells at every turn, and action on a large scale. All while making it believable and entertaining.Could he pull it off? The answer is yes.Very seldom am I able to use the sentence: The movie was better than the book. Seldom, but here it fits the case. The movie Stardust was filled with mind-blowing action sequences, witty humor, clever lines, and a gripping plot line that slightly differed from that of the novel but was completely for the better. There is something for every viewer: action, romance, comedy, fantasy, horror; all brought together in a near-perfect way.A modern fairytale, Stardust begins in a different place, the fictional country of wall just outside Great Britain. The city is named Wall because of the stone barrier surrounding it. Nobody is allowed to cross the barrier, neither citizens of wall, or those outside wall. Yet young Dunstan Thorn is mischievous and tricks the guard and escapes to the outside world where he meets the lovely Una at the fairy market. They fall in love and she gives birth to their son, Tristan Thorn, who is the main focus of the movie. When he is grown, he is just like his father: wanting to be outside the enclosure in which he has grown up. To win the heart of the icy Victoria, of whom he is love, he promises her that he will bring her the fallen star they see as they picnic on a grassy starlit hill.From there the movie only gets better, drawing to a close with a satisfying climax and the perfect ending.Even though it is two-plus hours, the movie didn't feel a minute too long as most movies of the same length do. Charlie Cox (Tristan) and Claire Danes (Yvainne) delight throughout the entire movie, taking us along a ride that includes Robert De Niro, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Sienna Miller among others. If there was any flaw in this movie it was that it was severely under-promoted and could have done much better had it been advertised more.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A perfect example of Fat Girl Fantasy.,"This is a movie of what I like to call Fat Girl Romantic Fantasy- meaning unrealistic and harlequin novel dramatic handling of medieval fantasy characters. Take all the dirt and violence and sex away and you are left with this very light handling of what could have been a very cool movie. Instead we get the same dopey kind of Disney crapola that will appeal to parents that want to let their kids loose on a movie with no full frontal nudity and nobody being tortured to death, and yet escape without a cohesive plot or an entertaining script.If you watch your movies based on what they are NOT - this movie is for you- it's a piece of crap designed for that mental sloth that inhabits suburbia and doesn't like being offended or frightened with movies. these are the spawn of the men that liked date movies and chick flicks.They can have this stupid dog of a movie- every time this movie had a chance to soar it stayed flat footed dopey and safe. I am sure the kids will love it- I will go throw up now.PLOT: A moses style beginning for a boy that is left on the doorstep in a basket learns that he may have some roots in a land of Faeries on the other side of the forbidden wall- unicorns, fallen stars, magic spells for children with adhd and speech impediments abound. If he captures a falling star he can win the hand of the girl he loves, but others want the falling star for their own reasons, and so a chase through faeryland ensues.Excitement does not. File this under fat girl romantic fantasy.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Terrific Summer Fantasy Flick!,"Stardust, which I'm sure you've all seen commercials for, is out in theaters.I watched it today. And you know what I think of it? . . . I think it's bloody brilliant.Story: Very well done, the director (I'm assuming) took a brilliant book written by the quite-talented Neil Gaiman and made it into a fine film.True, the special effects were a bit over done, and a few spots were a tad slow, but they were maybe ten minutes in a 2 hour and 8 minute movie. Fine acting by the entire crew, especially newcomer Charlie Cox and Claire Danes herself. I hope Charlie sticks around. He's very talented from what I see. And personally, I found Claire Danes to be on the same level of beauty as Michelle Pfeiffer.And if for no other reason, go see it for Robert De Niro's portrayal of a gay pirate. I promise you it's hilarious.I'm afraid it's going to be one of those movies that does terribly in theatres though. Which would be sad, as it was a terrific storyline, something which directors don't seem capable of producing anymore.All in all, a 9 out of 10.GO WATCH IT!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Best Movie in a long time! (spoiler free).,"The wife and I were arguing our way through the video store and decided to rent this title.It was quite obvious from the DVD case that it was geared towards a female audience but a quick scan of the screen captures on the back made it look like a fairly fantastic movie that promised to impress. The synopsis read a little weakly but we were'nt expecting to end up with an A+ movie at this time of the year anyways.We were greeted with a fairytale-like introduction but it was quite apparent early on from some minor innuendos that this movie was geared towards an older teenage or adult audience.(I would recommend pre-screening it before showing it to a younger audience.) If you find the content is not too strong for your children then I can guarantee this movie will rivet them down for a quality family movie night.My wife described the best quality of the movie as a sort of ""Je ne cest quoi.""(I don't know what.) While I must say the first thing I noticed about the movie was it's fantastic score of music which acted like an engine driving each scene along.There are many reasons why one might enjoy this movie though; The videophiles will find that the visuals although not flawless are still definitely worth mentioning. A high definition version of this movie would definitely please your eyes and put your expensive TV to good use.To the audiophile you will find that the sound effects are very balanced and appropriate. As I mentioned above the music is a key factor in how I scored this movie.The plot is to die for if you are into fantasy/ epic/ adventure/ romance/ all of the above movies. At a quick glance it seems very far fetched but when you look back again you will not be able to look away until the credits come up. The acting is solid and will leave you quite satisfied.The entire movie is well presented and with all of it's elements combined came out of the blue and completely shocked me. I wasn't expecting to be so dazzled by a movie I had previously never heard any mention of. My immediate reaction was to look for other movies directed by Matthew Vaugn but I was disappointed to find a very limited filmography. The next fantasy movie he does I will definitely be seeing on the silver screen.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An Unexpected Pleasure,"I've read a lot of differing opinions about ""Stardust,"" from raves to pans. One of my co-workers won't go see it because some of her friends have told her that it takes liberties with the book that they felt were unacceptable. She says that she may see it when it's released on DVD. I'm sorry, but I don't understand people who don't like movies because they don't follow the book exactly. They're two different mediums, for Pete's sake! What may read well on the written page may not play well on the big screen. After all, is ""The Wizard of Oz"" less of a classic because it didn't adhere scrupulously to L. Frank Baum's original book? Is Walt Disney's ""Bambi"" less moving because it took liberties with Felix Salten's tale?There! I've gotten THAT off my chest!My partner and I both thoroughly enjoyed ""Stardust."" It has action, adventure, humor, and magic. It starts off a bit slowly, but once it gets going, it's great fun. And unlike other fantasy films of recent years, this one is self-contained. The end of the movie is the end of the story. Michelle Pfeiffer seems to take delight in portraying evil women these days (viz. ""Hairspray"" and now ""Stardust"") and she's wonderful. Peter O'Toole is fine as the old king. Robert DiNiro is absolutely hysterical in his role as Captain Shakespeare. The rest of the cast couldn't be bettered. All the threads of the story wrap themselves up very nicely in the finale. We definitely will be acquiring this one on DVD when it's released.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

One of the best role he've ever had, he must been going through a change of his acting style or he got paid a lot, Because he've never played a more unique role then that, so this goes out to you De Niro fans, he's good in this one. anyway so the movie had some good laughter and some cool special FX scenes, other than that it was just a normal fantasy movie, but filled with great actors, was surprised when Richie Gervais appeared.

Only just 8/10 from mightyzebra,"In just about no doubts, this is an entertaining, exciting adventure and fantasy film. But just how many good points are there to it?1. Even without animation this is good for children (except for a few pieces of CGI to help with the special effects). 2. Some parts are ""Tongue in cheek"" to entertain adults. 3. There is good acting in this film. 4. The storyline is very well-thought up and convincing. 5. There are many charming and a few heart-wrenching parts of this film.In what seems to be the Victorian era, a young man walks over a long wall beside his home town and enters an amazing, remarkable whole new world. He meets a slave girl, who calls herself a princess. Nine months later, back in his home town, he receives a baby in a basket and he realises it is from the slave girl over the wall...Years later, the baby Tristain is nearly a grown man and he is in love with a woman whom he lives near to. They see a shooting star fall from the sky and it lands over the wall and Tristain tells her he will go over the wall to give her the star...Recommended for children aged 10 and above (because of a few rather tense fighting scenes), this is an entertaining film good for the whole family. It may not be to everyone's standard, although there is likely to be at least one quality which you will admire when you watch it.Enjoy ""Stardust""! :-)",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Just saw the movie tonight,"We just got back from watching Stardust at a free early preview that was shown here in Clovis, CA.Parents, pay attention to the PG-13 rating. I noticed some people brought their young children - not recommended. I'm glad I didn't take my 8 year old grand-daughter as there are a few violent scenes that would have disturbed her. I will buy the movie when it comes out on DVD and let her watch it when she is older.My husband and I enjoyed it very much and would have been satisfied even if we would have paid (although they did get $10 out of us for a popcorn and soda.) I thought the movie was well paced, it kept our interest throughout the entire 2 hours. De Niro fans are going to love him as Captain Shakespeare and he provides the comic relief. Seeing him in this role will be worth shelling out $10 for! Who would have thought he could be so funny!I gave it a 9 out of 10 for it's genre. Like I said it's good enough to buy the DVD when it's released and will enjoy watching it over and over throughout the years with my OLDER (13yrs +) grandchildren.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Everything a fairy tale should be,"What a wonderful, fanciful movie ""Stardust"" is.I could easily end it with that one statement and suffice to say, one could take it as a very strong recommendation to go see it.At a time when Hollywood seems bent on forcing remakes and sequels down our throats, ""Stardust"" makes us remember why we go to the movies in the first place - to escape reality for a couple of hours and explore other lives, other times, or other planets. Ironically, ""Stardust"" takes us to all three places effortlessly and with a childlike glee we all long for.""Stardust"" is full of all the characters we remember as children: princes, witches, pirates, ghosts and scoundrels. It has the damsel in distress, the hero, the rogues, the obstacles, spells, antidotes, charms, and even a touch of light-speed to make it quasi modern.""Stardust"" is about a man from the town of Wall, which is conveniently situated next to a wall that separates their town from a magical kingdom. The only way past the wall is through a breech that is diligently guarded by a scruffy old codger (played wonderfully by David Kelly). One day a young man from Wall named Ben Barnes out maneuvers the old guard and escapes through the breech. He happens upon an enchanted kingdom called Stormhold where he meets a chained (and very sexy) young lady named Una. She is held captive by a witch and leashed by an unbreakable chain. While the witch is away, Una seduces Ben and sends him on his way. Ben returns to Wall without incident and continues his life. But nine months later he is summoned to the wall breech where the old guard hands him what you might expect - a baby boy.The boy, named Tristan grows up to be a rather hapless young man (Charlie Cox) who is smitten with a girl way out of his league and also betrothed to another. Nevertheless, the young lady (named Victoria and played Sienna Miller) goes out once with Tristain and he confesses his love to her. After they espy a falling star, she tells him he can have her if he retrieves the star and brings it back to her. He agrees and sets out on his quest, which will take him to the other side of the wall.Meanwhile in the kingdom of Stormhold, the old king (perfectly played by Peter O'Toole) is dying. He calls his remaining living sons to tell them who shall succeed him to the throne. His sons' names are Primus, Secondus, Sextmus, and Septimus. The other sons where killed by the other brothers in a humorous competition to see who lives to get the throne.Anyway, he tosses his ruby charm to the sky and Voila, that what brings the star to earth.The star crashes in the form of a beautiful woman named Yvaine (Clare Danes) and she, of course, is wearing the charm. But little does she know she is now being persuaded by Tristain, the Princes, and also an aging witch named Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) who wants to cut out the stars heart to regain her own youth.Complicated? Yes. But it all comes together as the adventure unfolds.Tristain is the first to find Yvaine but is so blinded by his devotion to Victoria he doesn't recognize the growing bond between he and Yvaine. His initial interest lie only in returning Yvaine to Victoria as proof of his love. But he must get past the princes and Lamia first. The princes aren't that big an issue as they are constantly trying to kill each other - and just as in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" - never has death been so funny.But Tristain also encounters the witch who enslaved his mother (though he doesn't know it's his mother) and a band of flying pirates led by Robert DeNiro.His is the most important character in the movie and DeNiro plays it to a tee. He steals the movie with his toughness and soon we learn an undercover secret that will leave audiences on the floor with laughter. Though his role is small in length, DeNiro is extraordinary!Michelle Pfeiffer is wonderful as Lamia - a sexy evil witch. Claire Danes is most appropriate as the confused and distressed Yvaine. She makes a perfect damsel. Jason Flemyng, Adam Buston, Rupert Everett, and Mark Strong add the perfect dose of levity as the fighting princes whom, as they die return as ghosts ala ""Blithe Spirit"" and ""High Spirits"".Moreover director Matthew Vaughn, whose only other directing experience was ""Layer Cake"", weaves an enchanting tale that everyone will enjoy.""Stardust"" may be too complex for young children, but anyone over the age of 13 will want to see this movie multiple times. It's that good. ""Stardust"" is what movies are supposed to be. Perfectly written, perfectly cast, perfectly directed, and perfectly acted. In other words...perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pleasant surprise; well constructed fantasy adventure,"What's not to like? Vindictive witches, a magical star that moonlights as a beautiful woman, seven brothers--all possible heirs to a vacated throne--picking each other off, a Medieval Las Vegas, a gate guardian who does kung-fu, flying pirate ships, wild swashbuckling sword play; this movie has it all.A great fairytale style adventure for adults, although a little too violent in places for kids. Fantasy stories are often difficult to write, as the author has to create an entire world, but the land this story takes you to is given more than adequate foundation, and the back stories of the numerous characters are developed quickly and clearly. Basically, there are ""two worlds,"" one of scientific law, and the other where magic governs. They are separated by a stone wall, with one single gate of passage. Entry from the ""real"" one into the ""fantasy"" land is restricted by an old guy who beats the snot out of interlopers.There are several subplots, but the one prize everybody wants: the witches, the princes, a gypsy, a star crossed lover, and a few others is a woman who is sometimes human, sometimes a stellar object (don't ask, just believe!), and she has a power they're all after. Extremely well written, all these interlocking subplots converge for some good old style fairy tale good vs. evil fireworks. Acting is superior throughout; the witches are scary, the backstabbing princes are nasty, the star/woman is indeed ""heavenly,"" the spectator ghosts are amusing, the pirates are both greasy and funny, the hero easy to root for. Special effects are devised and utilized very well.It's obvious from the start how everything will work out, but it's a fairy tale, so that's to be expected, and it certainly doesn't take anything from the entertainment value of the movie. One of the better jobs of storytelling done this year; recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A classic modern fairytale,"There's really little I can find that is negative about 'Stardust.' For what it is, it's possibly as perfect as a film could be. It's a fairytale - pure and simple. It has everything you'd probably expect to see in a 'classic Disney' cartoon - dashing princes, beautiful princesses, evil witches and more magic than you could shake a wand at. There really is nothing new regarding the plot. If you've seen one fairytale then, technically, you've seen this story and nothing will come as much of a surprise when it comes to the plot. However, 'Stardust' isn't your average fairytale.If you check out the tagline on the marketing, you'll see it says something like, 'The fairytale that won't behave.' I can see where they're coming from. It's a cheeky little number that accomplishes what few films can - it's very watchable for both adults and children. Kids will love the simple 'boy meets girl' story. Characters are very easily identifiable as either 'good' or 'evil.' But the film's really bonus is its much darker undertones. There are simply dozens of visual and scripted gags which will probably go way over children's head and be picked up by adults.But, it's not just the script that's fun - every cast member is a recognisable face in their own right. Whether it's the narrator - Sir Ian McKellen, or the dodgy seller of lightning in a bottle (and other magical goods), Ricky Gervais. Naturally, the film likes to highlight its two 'trump cards' - none other than Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiro. Of course they turn in as excellent performances as you'd expect (I won't go into DeNiro's performance for fear of spoiling it for people who don't know what he gets up to on board his flying lightning-harvesting ship when his crew aren't watching and Pfeiffer smoulders as the evil witch, ruthlessly hunting our young couple). But it's the film's two leads that really have to carry the film. Clare Danes is more recognisable than her heroic counterpart, Charlie Cox, but their chemistry is just perfect.All in all, you'll be guaranteed a good time with this film whether you're young or old. You'll have to have a heart of stone not to be enchanted by its simple tale of princes and princesses, told to perfection for a modern audience.And, is it just me, or is the soundtrack one of the most uplifting ever in recent times?",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Michelle Pfeiffer was good, that's really about it.","This film may have wanted to be like Princess Bride but failed on all levels. I usually like well done fantasy movies but this was just a mess. The narration by Ian McKellen was fine but just about everything felt rehashed from other films and way too long to boot. Even the best parts of the score sounded stolen from Wojciech Kilar's excellent Dracula. Mark Strong was good as usual. But why does Robert De Niro keep wasting his talent trying to be funny, isn't there anything out there worthy of him any more. Too bad we didn't get to see more of Ricky Gervais' and Henry Cavill's characters.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Much Better then Expected!!,"I absolutely loved this movie. I kind of wanted to see this movie but when my friend suggested it I was disappointed (there were other movies I wanted to see). Well, I saw this movie and absolutely loved it!! This movie was funny, romantic and overall a good story. I loved the fact that everything was wrapped up in the end and everything connected. Robert DeNiro was SO FUNNY and I really loved his part in the movie. Claire Danes was excellent as usual. And the actor who played Tristan was really cute and funny. He really made a good transition in his part from the young, silly, clumsy boy to a strong, courageous man. I really recommend this movie. And others who write that this movie was too this or too that need to get a life. Movies are for entertainment and are not always perfect. Movies are also up to many interpretations so it is wrong to say that this was a stupid story.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What is wrong with me???,"I don't know, i tried 3 times to understand this movie, but i figured there is nothing to understand. I don't like concept of SF/Fairy tale. While whole universe and history of world seems interesting, the main story(fairytale) is not as much as interesting. Whole thing about witches, princes, princess doesn't belong to this universe. So i don't think that this is bad movie, but it wasn't what i expected.At least only thing that paid of is Robert De Niro and his brilliant performance (i think that everybody knows on what scene i am talking about):)So i give it 5/10 for those who know what they expect of this movie - go and see it, however i am not in that group...",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A brand new fairy tale of true love... for the ages.,"Oh my. This is EXACTLY the kind of movie we want Hollywood to make more of. The acting was perfect, the story was wonderful, and the love was plentiful. It had sky pirates, heroic unicorns, and glowing hearts. What more could you ask for in a movie? We just saw it on opening night in Miami, and the audience was spellbound. Much laughter, at all the right moments. Gasping and cheering and many many sighs.If you enjoy a good fairy tale, and you still believe in true love, don't miss this in the theater.

Don't be the one's saying to yourself after watching it on your 36"" TV, ""Honey we should have seen this at the movie theater"". It really is a theater made movie with many action scenes and beautiful cinematographyDon't hesitate to catch this while it's on the big screen!Especially if you enjoy Fantasy.

A Enjoyable Fantasy!,"This is a great film that concluded the 2007 blockbuster summer season. This is a great fantasy film that has some romance but thankfully is not overloaded with romance. I was surprised how much I liked this film because I thought this would be a full out romance movie with some aspects of fantasy mixed in. It's actually the other way around.This is about some guy who travels to a magic kingdom to retrieve a fallen star in order to be with some girl he loves. Unfortunately, the star is not what he expects and he isn't the only person looking for the star.The acting is very good. I liked newcomer Charlie Cox. Claires Danes did a magnificent job. My favorite screen presence is Robert De Niro. I really liked him here.Overall, this is a pleasant fantasy movie that is fairly family-friendly. I would want to see this again.

Very Imaginative Fantasy Film,"I went to the pre-screening of Stardust last night and am very glad I did. Aside from the movie, the offer of free Stone Cold ice cream and a free massage, plus raffle tickets for the book, and then free posters were over the top. Unfortunately, they didn't have many posters. Everyone got a card with a peel-off, silver stick-on star on it as an additional promotional for the movie.No need to really comment on the storyline since others here already have, but it was a wonderfully fun story to follow. It was incredibly detailed and imaginative ... so much so that there isn't another movie out there that can compare (as some already have done). This movie was so uniquely different it made it a pleasure to view. There is various tidbits of humor interlaced within this movie that are so well executed that they are an additional bonus detail. Someone I spoke to last night said the author of the book detests taking baths and hasn't bathed in years. He told me, too, that the author has other books with movie deals in the fire, so I am looking forward to more. There is a scene in the movie of one of the princes' in a bathtub (won't tell the details), but suspect this was the film-maker's symbolic tribute to the author done in a most clever way. There was a lot of attention to detail in this movie I was astounded.It was evident as I left the theater that there wasn't anyone who didn't like the movie.I am somewhat biased because I love fantasy films ... if they are well done, and this one was! If you like fantasy films with a good story and one that goes out of their way to attention to details, you'll fully enjoy this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
when was the last time you wished upon a star?,"I definitely agree that the trailers for this film don't do it much justice. I went in expecting to watch a children's tale similar to Narnia, but I was pleasantly surprised with the humor and poignancy of the story.How could you go wrong casting Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiro in a film, right? But it was Claire Danes that gave a memorable performance as Yvaine. For a moment, she makes us believe that true love does exist. And it is able to put a glow in someone's life.I haven't read the novel (by Neil Gaiman) that this movie is based on, but I'm sure there are a lot more nuances to the story than the movie is able to show. Topics like pretending to be who you aren't, infatuation, conditional vs. unconditional love, family.All of these plot undercurrents are cast against the backdrop of a world where magic and fantasy are merely separated by a stone wall. I really admire the author and screenwriter for not taking this story too far. For not introducing dozens of characters that don't get the proper depth in a movie. And mostly for giving us a fun sense of wonderment when we look up into the night sky and see a particularly brilliant star.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Brilliant,"It is difficult for a grown man to admit that he has shed tears while enjoying a film, even anonymously. But I did. And it was fully justified. There's just so much beauty in this movie. The world they've created is indeed mesmerizing and, well, magical but it is the characters and the actors portraying them that give it the sort of quality that will withstand the test of time and turn this little gem into a classic.For the more cynical members of the parish, you will indeed see some silliness and some flaws, thus confirming your world view. But if you only open your eyes and heart as well as your mind, you may just have a pleasant time.In conclusion, I highly recommend this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The effects was good and the story was really pulling me in. I was more and more amazed over this film. The story IS like a classic adventure tale, like the ones u liked when u were a kid. Then when i saw Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert D. Niro. Now i was clear to me that this for sure wasn't a no name movie.And i watched it, having big laughs, and ""fell"" in love with Yvaine. And this story had it all. For me it was a really good experience! :)And that is what matters too me, if the movie moves me in some way, then it is a good movie. And this one did it brilliantly!

Stellar!!,"What a brilliant movie! This fantasy tale entertains from the very first minute to the end with no lengths in between.This movie is very polished and it has everything one would expect from a good fantasy movie - including a fair bit of humor without ever getting ""too cheesy"".This movie will entertain kids as well as adults alike. Adults will like it since it is not ""childish"" in any way, and kids will like it since the story is not too complex.I especially like: * the movie is beautifully shot. Watching this on a 52"" plasma guarantees entertainment from the first minute to the last. Its not on the ""epic level"" like LOTR, but it comes very close in terms of ""creating"" the right feel and ambiance needed for good fantasy entertainment.* Even if there's violence and fighting it is not a bloody movie at all, doesn't idolize violence as ""solution for all things"". (Refreshing after seeing a bunch of Mel Gibson movies....) * A nice bit of humor throughout the movie * No ""morale teachings at all cost"" as seen in SO MANY movies. There are so many movies from Hollywood which win prices because they always *need* to teach a morale, like ""family is important"" or things like that. They have an overly emotional plot like featuring a dying mother with 7 kids, and, at all costs, need to ""embed"" a morale lesson, over and over again.This movie does NOT lift a finger trying to teach a lesson. Thank God! This is fantasy entertainment as its supposed to be, perfect in any sense! I don't know whether this movie earned any awards - in my opinion it deserves them. Stellar movie!

Stardust promised so much,"Stardust tells the story of a young man who sets off on a journey to recover a fallen star for his true love, only to find the star as a beautiful woman, and witches and the King's sons are also after her.Based on Neil Gaimen's novel, this fantasy adventure is interesting and light-hearted, but doesn't have the humour and the true lovable factor to make a true classic.With an exceptional cast which includes several Oscar nominated actors, and zeitgeist stars, this had true potential but in the end there just isn't enough zest to bring it out of a conventional plot line.O'Toole (Lawrence of Arabia), Pfeiffer (Fabulous Baker Boys), De Niro (Raging Bull) are just some of the names included and all do their roles justice, but not even the talent of these Oscar nominated actors could do much to satisfy the plot. In the end, it just felt very star driven. De Niro was the best role of the film, the funniest and strangest.The plot is inconsistent and hardly exciting with plenty of lapses, including a really uncomfortable first meeting between Tristan and Yvaine. The whole Victoria and Tristan also is very far-fetched and daft to base the whole journey upon.There seems to be too much going on at the beginning, and though it does even itself out, there then seems to be too many perfect timings and chance meetings which gives the plot a lack of realism.The tagline ""The fairytale that won't behave"" is the most bizarre and worst one there has been for many years.Even Take That's Rule the world song for this film wears off, and is only included in the end credits.Not caring for visual effects, I hardly cared that they were very poor anyway.There is no true depth on any level of this film, with the plot and visual effects poor, the acting is mild exception. Not worth the price of admission or on DVD, this is a very forgettable fairy tale which promised so much.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The most emotional movie about the most fantastic love story I have ever seen for now!,"The first time I saw this movie is in 2007, when it released as well as I was still a freshman in Uni. It is an English class, not as usual, I didn't escape from the class that day, and I am sure that was the most wisdom decision I made about running away from the classes or not. Maybe for attracting students to come back to class, our English teacher surprisingly projected a movie for the rest of us. Only less than 20 of us got the opportunity to appreciate the movie (You can image how unpopular his classes are), unfortunately I was late so missing the name of the movie......One thing I can clearly remember is that it is the most attractive English class I've ever attended in that age, and I was never distracted for only a minute. The reason why I fell in love with this film, I think is because that I was still a freshman on love and I was thirst to find a true lover. However, I found I was wrong about myself when I finally found this movie and watched it for a second time three years later. I was still a undergraduated student, still single, but I had been refused by two girls, the thirsty turned a little bit to desperation. This time the more feeling I got from this movie is admiring, touchable and disappointed of myself.Our poor Tristan is the same as me at the beginning, swearing to bring the girl happiness but being played by her. It seems like I am the Tristan at the first 10 minutes, which made me strongly identify with him. I carefully watched and wanted to find some moments I can learn from to break my curse. Honestly, after watching this movie that time, I was disappointed and concluded that it is the bloodline making our poor Tristan become a prince and helping him get every thing a man fights for.Very soon, I forgot the name of the movie. Fortunately, I can hardly believe that I didn't delete this movie three years ago after it disappointed me. It is maybe my potential personality functioned and kept it for the future me. I opened the player without aware of it is that one, and this time I felt a new life come out of my mind. I finally understand that our prince Tristan is not happened to be the prince and not totally depends on the luck to get Yvaine. There are willpower and sacrifice when he steps into the unknown world to bring the star back; responsibility and loyalty when he insists to fulfill the promise; kindness and courage when he decides to save the girl, twice, once for a recognise girl and another for his true lover. Although the luck can't be overlooked, it is Tristan the young man with quite many good qualities can take the luck to happy ending.I am not disappointed, not thirsty to make a girlfriend, and I exactly know what I want and what I should do now. I will not be a lost young man any more. It is this movie help me commit to my heart, find a example learning from and teach me so many bright characteristics that I should occupy in my long rest of lifetime. Abusolutely happy ending for everyone, in the movie and in front of the screen.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Fairy Tale for Adults,"Stardust, which is adapted from Neil Gaiman's novel, despite my early skepticism translates very well onto film. After reading the book, I was slightly worried that the essence of the story wouldn't be captured on screen, but I couldn't have been more wrong. Matthew Vaughn's movie, like Gaiman's novel, does an excellent job of tackling serious themes like love and loss without ever taking itself too seriously. These comedic tones, which can be seen as subtle jabs to some fantasy epics, are what really led to my enjoyment of the book and the movie.Matthew Vaughn's talents in the directors chair have given the movie viewing public another excellent film. He does a great job of keeping the viewer completely emerged in what is happening to the characters throughout the film. While slightly over two hours long the film never once drags or feels bloated with needless characters or subplots (aka Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest). Working with a $70 million budget, which is a somewhat small budget for a fantasy film, Vaughn brings to life the Village of Wall and the kingdom Stormhold in such great detail. He takes Gaiman's descriptions of places, characters, and events and displays them magnificently on screen. He also manages to get some great performances from his entire cast.Newcomer Charlie Cox plays the main character of Tristran Thorn with great presence and charisma. He does a great job with the transformation from the lovable loser to the brave hero. Mark Strong also stole the show as the power hungry prince Septimus. Even though he was the ""villian"" of the film I hated to see anything happen to him because he brought so much to every scene that he was in. Michelle Pfeiffer, Robert De Niro, Claire Danes, and Sienna Miller also gave admirable performances in their supporting roles.The marketing campaign is the only thing that I have to complain about for this film. They did a terrible job of showing the public what this movie was going to be about. In any of the adds that I saw do you ever really get a glimpse of what the plot is going to entail. There was just random clips of Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert De Niro. While they were both good in the film, they were not in any way the main characters of the movie. I just hope good word of mouth will help this movie get the recognition it deserves to have!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A ""PG-13"" Movie with a ""G"" plot","There are four points I wanted to make about this film. One: This movie's plot would seem more feasible if it were a typical rated ""G"" Disney movie, but for a movie rated ""PG-13"" I want something more plausible. (Yes even in the fantasy genre, movies can be creditable, this movie wasn't) Two: There was no explanation offered for why Tristan's hair suddenly grew on the ship. If this was a magical ability of Shakespeare then why wasn't this more apparent? Three: Not one single character in the movie wondered what would happen if Shakespeare flew his ship over the wall. (I wondered this immediately after first seeing the ship.) Four: Too many continuity mistakes. Normally this is my least favorite of mistakes that movies make, mostly because I don't even notice them until I read about it on web sites like this one, however I was able to spot several on my first viewing of the movie. Having said all that I still recommend this movie, but only if you have nothing else to do. It's not bad, it's not great either but I don't think it's worth avoiding. I am reminded of something Ebert once said when critiquing a movie. He said ""A great film has at least three great scenes, and no bad ones."" Unfortunately for Stardust I can only think of one great scene and at least three bad ones.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Delicious, striking sets and rich, beautiful acting","Stardust is a lush fantasy story about love, dark magic, evil witches, entitlements of inheritance, and the twinkling stars in the sky. It is gorgeously filmed and well paced, and its denouement will make your heart soar.For the unrequited love of a girl, young Tristan (Charlie Cox) vows to bring back a fallen star. But once he makes it to the crater where the star hit, he realizes the star isn't a rock at all - it's a beautiful young lady named Yvaine (Claire Danes), who's none to pleased to have fallen from her high-and-mighty perch in the firmament. But promises being promises, Tristan ensnares Yvaine using an enchanted chain and begins their journey back to his village, so that he may present the star to his love, Victoria (Sienna Miller).But Tristan and Yvaine are unwittingly part of a larger story; the king of the enchanted realm (Peter O'Toole) has just died, and the new ruler will be he among the sons who possesses the kingdom's sacred ruby, which the dying king had tossed up into the heavens, where it smacked into Yvaine, thus bringing her crashing to Earth. Now all the king's remaining sons are on the hunt for the ruby, not knowing Yvaine wears it around her neck.Meanwhile, three witch sisters have noticed the falling star, which is a major omen in the kingdom of Stormhold; whoever can possess the fallen star will be immortal. You don't have to be pure evil to think immortality might be kind of fun, so the oldest of the sisters, Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) sets off to find it as well.During the long journey back home, Tristan learns about love and his own parentage. Oh, does he learn about love! With a griping, angry denizen of the sky as his prisoner, Tristan thinks he has everything worked out; he'll present Yvaine to Victoria, who will marry him instead of the cad Humphery (and really, could he be anything but a cad, with that name?).This is more than a simple fantasy story of good versus evil. It's about telling the difference between being infatuated and being in love; it's about trust and righteousness; it's about doing the right thing, even when it seems impossible to do so.Based on a Neil Gaiman story, Stardust is impeccably written (it was adapted for the screen by director Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman), with rich characterizations, top-notch acting, and wondrous visual effects. Robert DeNiro gets a showy role as the captain of a flying ship (sort of a cross between a dirigible and a pirate ship), and although it IS a showy role, DeNiro is far from hammy in it - he is, in fact, outstanding. Pfeiffer is remarkably despicable as the ugly-then-beautiful-then-ugly rotten witch Lamia. She doesn't dress down for the role, she dresses down and dirty and Lamia is not a shallow, one-dimensional character in the least. A lesser actress would have played the part a little over the top, portraying Lamia as a power-mad demagogue obsessed with looking pretty, but Pfeiffer delivered a multilayered performance, fulsome in its depth.Danes is also a huge asset here. Her dancing eyes and rubied lips (matching the stone, of course), coupled with the CGI-added glow about her (since she is, after all, a fallen star) lend a real ethereal feel to her character, but it's her acting that lends the appropriate gravitas; otherwise, Yvaine would be a simple, irritated version of Victoria.And although the role of Tristan might have been given to an actor offering only a callow performance, Charlie Cox is fantastic as the protagonist. He doesn't just let things happen to him, he makes things happen through decisive actions, good or bad. He's forthright and honest; he's just blinded by the prospect of love from Victoria.Exquistely photographed and with quick, efficient pacing that doesn't let itself get bogged down in the special effects of the moment, Stardust is a real treat for fans of fantasy novels and movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This movie is excellent!!!,"All I can say is WOW! I didn't know what to expect about this movie after having read a ton of reviews. I was afraid it would be too cliché, cheezy and predictable. I was pleasantly surprised. Alone on a Saturday night, I had the pleasure of watching the movie myself - left alone to laugh out loud several times. Sure the movie was predictable at times and had its cliché moments, but overall it was incredibly well executed. The casting and acting was very good - Charlie Cox did well in the lead, Michelle Pfeiffer did as well as you would expect, as did Robert DeNiro; Claire Danes did an amazing performance whether you're a fan of hers or not. Overall, the supporting cast did a great job as well. And although the story was a fantasy and therefore had familiar elements to it, it definitely, as several other reviewers have commented, has a uniqueness that I have not seen of late. There were no real parts that dragged, the special effects were well integrated into the story line and did not seem forced and the details were simply awesome. When you watch the movie, you can really see a lot of detail work was done on the sets and you notice the details when you observe the subtle body language of the actors. Like most reviewers I would say it might not become quite the classic of Princess Bride (with it's most awesome quotes) or have the romance of Say Anything, but it is likely to continue to hold its own in the future due to its unique style, story line and execution. Great date movie, though the violence (even if it is relatively cartoonish overall) will turn off some and makes it inappropriate for kids. I really liked this movie for its combination of fantasy and romance...and that's coming from a guy.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant,"This film was absolutely brilliant i really must say. It was a new, fresh look at fairy tales. The main things that set it apart from others is that strangely in some elements it has a sense of realism to it, for example they don't have posh ridiculous accents, and the various cameos such as Ricky Gervais and Robert De Niro really added to this.Even though i guest what the story would be about 15 minutes in, it didn't take away from the enjoyment one bit! This definitely isn't a just a kids fairy tale it appeals to all ages. Don't be fooled by the trailer, when i saw it i really didn't like the look of it and thought it would be another meaningless blockbuster but it really isn't.I would 100% advice anyone whatever age you are to watch this it is really a brilliant, warm funny film. Robert De Niro does a funny and different performance, at first when he came on i was thinking it would be the same old role that he usually plays but this film is just full of surprises! WATCH IT its a must see movie! 10/10 and usually I'm very critical of films.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
pretty boring,"-- the CGI was kind of trash which is understandable given it was released in 2007
-- the story bored me quite a lot and I didn't really care about whether the characters survived or not. I couldn't bring myself to root for them very much.-- the jokes weren't funny, which would normally be fine since it's not a comedy but they tried to make a lot of jokes and they don't work

Fantastic Fairytale,"I had previously read the illustrated novel of this story. I had thoroughly enjoyed the book and was keen to see the film. However, two years later I finally got to watch this film.Needless to say I thoroughly enjoyed it. The story centres around a boy in a small parochial town in England who gets involved in a fantastical adventure.The film is quite long at two hours but passes quickly. This is helped by the balance between lighter and more serious moments. In terms of cast, you can see the enjoyment they obviously had making this film. I thought the young lead was excellent as the small town boy and thought Michelle Pfeifer was excellent as the villain. I'm glad I bought this film as surely it will warrant further viewing. I would highly recommend this film. It is a perfect escapist fairytale with a lightness of touch that stops it becoming prurient or bogged down in special effects. If you want a great movie for an enjoyable evening of fun and relaxation then you won't go far wrong with this.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A joyous experience and the underrated Gem of last year,"I had a sneaking feeling that when I went to see this film it was going to be one of those that was going to be a complete waste of time or a quiet masterpiece and thankfully it is the latter.After a quiet but intriguing start which the adults will probably enjoy more than the children, we are thrown into the deep end by watching the king of the magical kingdom offer a challenge to his potential heirs in order for them to become king, whilst the hero of the piece tries to bring a star back for the spoilt brat that he thinks he loves. After various scrapes we watch as the boy of the start becomes a man and realises what is important in life. Plaudits go to the gorgeous Michelle Pfeifer who has a great time in the best role she has had for years, but the scene stealing award goes to Robert De Niro who is simply amazing and I'm not a De Niro fan! But in this film he plays completely against type and is a revelation, which, for an actor of his years is no mean feat.Get it on DVD when it comes out. You deserve a treat",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Quite possibly the most beautiful movie this summer.,"""Stardust"" is, at first glance, a typical fairy tale. A magical world, evil, ugly old witches, all the fairy tale elements. But dig deeper and you'll get a beautiful story of love and heroism. The story: A boy promises to bring back a fallen star for the girl he wants to marry. He crosses ""the wall"" and finds that the ""star"" is a beautiful woman. Meanwhile, three witches learn that the star has fallen, and go to get her for their own means. And finally, the remaining sons of the dying king compete to kill their brothers and gain the crown. These three stories come together in a thrilling climax that will have you on the edge of your seat. The previews don't give it its due credit. ""Stardust"" is an enchanting(if you'll pardon the pun) and exciting movie that the entire family will love.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Enchanting,"When I first went to the theater to see this, I honestly didn't know what to expect. I only went to see it because I am a Claire Danes fan, ever since My So-Called Life, I have had to watch all of her movies. Anyway I went in there with low expectations and came out pleasantly surprised. I loved this movie so much! When it came out on DVD I bought it right away and I have also purchased the book. Stardust is very clever, it is the right mix of comedy, romance, and fantasy.Not only was I impressed by Claire Danes' performance, but Michelle Pfeiffer is an excellent witch and Robert De Niro is simply hilarious.

Entertaining and Light-Hearted Fantasy,"I really enjoyed this ""star-studded"" movie, which is a fantasy along the lines of Princess Bride or the Golden Compass (minus the hidden meanings or social commentary as far as I could tell). It is a little long, so not sure it'd be right for the wee ones, but it was great for what it was. The visuals were gorgeous, and the story line interesting enough, and all the actors did a great job. I was surprised a fantasy had slipped by me without my having heard must about it. I would definitely watch it again, although not as many times as the Princess Bride.

hey not bad at all for a fantasy,well as you might have guessed I do have a predisposition to fantasy films but this one is really OK! a great little adventure.The best thing is that the plot development and the dialogue is 90% devoid of cliché lines. That really saves any film in my book - perhaps this is down to Jane Goldman. Some nice twists and turns.The sort of silly medieval gibberish that many producers sanction for feature films is avoided by the little quirks. The ghost sons of the king could be done in a shabby over the top way but it is considerably understated.I'm a sucker for romance so this is a main reason why I like the film.

"Beautiful, wonderful and well-balanced","The film has everything you need for a good fairy tale.It's a beautiful mix of fairy-tale places and characters, love and hate, humor and magic.
There are good guys and bad guys, and of course there are indirect - not quite good, but complementing the performance with humor.Great acting.
Good and not exaggerated special effects.
Very well-chosen music that builds emotions.Great for teenagers.

Beautiful fairy tale with a tang of cinema humour,"No, the film is not a comedy, more of a darker fairy tale, but there are certain scenes that clearly point to other movies. For example Claire Danes and Charlie Cox standing on the prow of the air ship as it hits the water. It must have been hard for the actors not to raise their arms. Also when Michelle Pfeiffer used a voodoo doll; very Eastwick of her.The story is almost standard: you get the prince(s), the princess, the witches, the hero, the evil king, the pirate... all the tarot cards are there. The effects are good without being terribly flashy, the actors seem to have been chosen for their match to the role rather than using Hollywood stars (pun intended) to bring people in the cinemas.However, what makes this film good is that it puts the story in the foreground and the actors, soundtrack, special effects and whatnot remain where they are supposed to: as props for telling it.Bottom line: good fairy tale, both for children and adults, and a very well done film.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What a Family film!,"Yeah I have to say that. I'm not a little boy anymore. But I still enjoy this movie. Good script. Good production design. And I couldn't remember any other movie there's a girl glowing like in the movie. So beautiful and memorable moment. And the movie is better because of the witch Lamia, she's playing that role so good.

Waste of a lot of talent,"This movie barely passed as acceptable for me. I cannot believe so much solid acting talent was amassed here with so little result.As was mentioned by another rater, Cox was a weak lead. The other stars really had little to do with the script they were given. Pfeiffer was good, though.The movie ran for slightly over two hours, and I was flagging at 30 minutes. I got the DVD from the library and it took me five different sittings over 3 days to get through it. Being a fairy tale, knowing the end at the 10 minute mark did not help.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
More then a whiff of stardust!   MAGIC!,"Films that depend heavily on special effects as created by computer generated graphics have never been too interesting for this viewer - and that, of late, covers a lot of territory from the Harry Potter series through the continuous glut of sci-fi films, vampire tales, and apocalyptic epics, etc. But there is something very different about STARDUST that brings it into a realm of solid storytelling simply enhanced by well-done special effects, and that difference is in the story itself, an unabashed fairy tale populated with wonderful characters played by some of our finest actors.And it all begins with a wall (according to the narrator, Ian McKellen) that separates the real world from an enchanted place and through that wall runs a young lad who starts the frolic. Flash forward and the child of the runaway lad, Tristan (a magnetically alive Charlie Cox), has groan to maturity and has fallen in love with the beautiful Victoria (Sienna Miller) who demands a star from Tristan to prove his love. The magic begins when that 'star' falls from the sky in the form of Yvaine (Claire Danes, radiant even without the halo that surrounds her). The foul witch Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) and her wicked sisters become aware and plan to cut out the heart of Yvaine in order to gain immortality. The little village is also under the stranglehold of the impending loss of their king (Peter O'Toole) and there is a struggle among the seven sons to ascend the throne: the seventh son Septimus (Mark Strong) defeats his now spirit brothers and sets off to gain the stone that Yvaine wears which will give him immortality. The on-the-run groups encounter a pirate, Captain Shakespeare (Robert DeNiro in a splendid role), who captures lightening in a marvelous flying ship manned by a swarthy crew. Of course Tristan and Yvaine become his 'captives', only to discover that the fey closet queen captain is on their side against the forces of evil. As the film progresses Tristan and Yvaine gradually fall in love, negating their past histories, and the ending is another act of pure magic: evil succumbs to good in the best of fairytale ways.The cast is uniformly excellent, from the true star turns by Pfeiffer, DeNiro, Danes, and Cox to the secondary roles equally well cast. The special effects are beautiful and very much in keeping with the story instead of simply breeding monsters to emerge from the bowels of the earth to destroy civilization. Everyone involved, from the director Matthew Vaughn to the writers Jane Goldman with Vaughn (and of course the creator of the novel Neil Gaiman) to the cast, seem to keep tongue in cheek and appear to be having as much fun as we the audience. It is a light, exceptionally beautiful fantasy that is pure joy! Grady Harp",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It has everything: magic, panoramic scenery, romance, true love, good versus evil, & a macho male supporting character who's a closet queen. The big screen viewing experience is KEY to maximum enjoyment of this movie. I'd bet money that Claire Danes went to the Gwynyth ""Emma"" Paltrow voice coach to prepare for this role. Charlie Cox as Tristan in the male lead is effective & adorable. Michelle Pfieffer is a treat (& somewhat of a surprising choice) for the wickedest of the Weird Sisters.

Excellent Fantasy Adventure,"Stardust is a fairy story, where good triumphs over evil and the hero eventually wins the girl. The film's most appreciative audience is likely to be children between the ages of 8 and 12 however it was officially rated a PG-13 partly for its ""risqué humor"" and Yahoo suggested the film was suitable for an audience of 14 and up. This probably explains why the film only took $39 million at the U.S. box office. It deserved to do better.Stardust takes places in a magical world called Stormhold. Charlie Cox is very good as the hero and Claire Danes is execellent as the love interest. De Niro plays a cross-dressing pirate called Captain Shakespeare. Michele Pfeiffer plays an evil witch and gives an over the top performances worthy of British pantomime. The supporting cast includes a long list of British acting notables including Sienna Miller, Ricky Gervais, Rupert Everett and Peter O'Toole. Everybody hams it up outrageously.

A confusing but okay film,"The movie starts off well, with a quaint setting and a classic fairy tale set-up. The bar is impressive, with numerous well-known British and Irish actors, as well as megastar American ones. HOWEVER, the film soon starts to devolve into too many characters and plot lines that are not fleshed out adequately. You don't get all that invested in the two leads, who are pretty dull. Also, the film isn't that old but contains several weird plot devices, such as characters who fall for their kidnapper/abusers, or how the threat of sexual assault is framed in a comical way.Women are depicted fairly poorly in this film overall. And instead of having a clear storyline, solid world-building and decent character development, the movie just had a number of ""convenient"" things happen at the right time but without explanation so that everything gets tied up nicely. I don't hate it, but it does feel like a one-off made-for-TV movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Fun and delightful journey,"A funny thing happened on my second viewing of this movie. I saw it when it was first released back in 2007 but apart from finding the special effects a little overblown, I was nowhere near as touched as I was watching the second time. Not sure if the difference is 8 years of additional maturity and life experience on my part, or that during the second viewing I saw the movie on its own merits rather than alongside a rerun of The Princess Bride in my head, and away from the rather pushy marketing when it was first released.I suspect that anyone who has a strong reaction to watching the characters is reacting to its portrayal of innocence. Through young Tristan we inhabit a character who is the embodiment of innocence and all it represents to us, such as trust, hope and youth/purity. At the start of the movie he is young and inexperienced, and he keenly feels it, confiding in his unrequited sweetheart Victoria about how he yearns to travel to exotic places just to fetch her a boon, not just Ipswich to buy her a ring. Despite his brave face, the humiliation of being beaten down by Victoria's preferred suitor Humphrey, and being identified as 'just a shop boy' lowers his spirits, but does not harden him. Despite his innocence Tristan is not naive; the power of his innocence comes from staying true to himself and having hope and faith despite of the setbacks and dangers he faces. It is trusting that your path is the right one for you, and keeping steadfast to it. In a less fantastical movie, innocence would have to be tempered with more cynicism, caution and an underlying belief that the only way to achieve his goals would be to go it alone. For this reason, all movies about the journey of an innocent are ensemble movies by necessity. Tristan cannot achieve his goals by virtue of innocence alone, but it his purity of heart which allows him to trust any mentors who happen on his path, and in doing so, they both learn from each other. Tristan's refreshing authenticity brings out the best part of Captain Shakespeare, and in return our hero gains confidence in himself and his abilities to achieve his ends.Young Tristan sets out to find a shooting star to prove his love to a village girl, but unknown to him, the star has powers that restore lost youth. The witches and princes also pursuing the shooting star for her gift of everlasting life and youth are wonderfully realized. Watching it the second time it occurred to me that their pursuit of prolonged youth is actually an attempt to reclaim lost innocence just for themselves. Stripped down to just its superficial traits, innocence embodies the younger self, unmarred, unaffected by the cruel life they have lived. The villains want to undo the effects of their harsh their lives and return to a state closer to purity – even if it is only skin deep. The biggest revelation to me on this second viewing was that despite the star Yvaine being the object of pursuit, the powers possessed by her character are the reflection of the qualities personified in Tristan, making the greatest treasure in this movie his strength, genuineness and his innocence.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

An excellent tale of romance and fantasy...,"In the late 80s, a new generation of writers changed the American comic book industry forever with the complex mature-themed nature of their stories, effectively transforming what was considered an unsophisticated literary genre into a well respected art form. Among that group of storytellers was Neil Gaiman, a young British writer who decided to try his luck at comic books convinced by his friend, Alan Moore (writer of the classic graphic novel ""Watchmen""). After landing a job at DC comics, Gaiman started the series that would make him famous, ""The Sandman"", the comic book where his taste for fantasy and great imagination found no limits. Years later Gaiman returned to prose, and so he decided to make a fantasy novel in the style of classic English fantasy, the one that used to be done before the days of Tolkien and Lewis' high fantasy. And the result was ""Stardust"".""Stardust"" is the story of Tristan Thorn (Charlie Cox), a humble young man hopelessly in love with the most beautiful girl in his town, Victoria (Sienna Miller). To his misfortune, she has accepted a marriage proposal by Humphrey (Henry Cavill), so he decides to give her an ultimate proof of his love: a star has fallen from the sky, so he tells Victoria that he'll bring it to her, even if that means to cross the legendary wall that separates their town from the mysterious forest. What Tristan doesn't know, is that the wall exists to separate his world from the magical realm of Stormhold, and that he is not the only one looking for the star, as a powerful witch (Michelle Pfeiffer) wants it to be young again, and two princes (Mark Strong and Jason Flemyng) need it to claim the throne of Stormhold. However, the biggest surprise will be the star's identity.Screenwriter Jane Goldman and director Matthew Vaughn make a nice adaptation of Gaiman's novel that keeps the story's core points, although they toned down the darkness of the novel quite a bit. This is not really a bad thing, as in the process, Goldman and Vaughn remained faithful to the novel's spirit and the result is a movie that joyfully plays with witty comedy, fantasy and romance, and yet it's still completely in tone with the fantasy stories that inspired Gaiman's book. In essence, ""Stardust"" is what could be called ""a fairy tale for grown-ups"", as it's fantasy is whimsical, clever and very imaginative, but with a greater emphasis on the characters and their development than in any epic scale adventure. And this is where ""Stardust"" has its strongest point: the character development is remarkably well done, and even those characters with very short screen time are unforgettable.While ""Stardust"" is a very different (and more ambitious) film to his previous movie, 2004's ""Layer Cake"", director Matthew Vaughn manages to make it work by concentrating in the story and letting everything else grow from there. Since comedy and romance are now the main ingredients of the film, Vaughn focuses the film on his characters, specially in the relationship the main couple. Still, while ""Stardust"" lacks the epic scope of high fantasy films, Vaughn manages to make his story a very beautiful looking one, giving life to the kingdom of Stormhold with a beautiful Victorian style and good care for details. Sadly, a fantasy film like ""Stardust"" fantasy films tends to relay a lot on special effects, and budgetary reasons prevented Vaughn from making truly stunning visuals, however, the ones that appear are good enough to make Stormhold come to life.As written above, ""Stardust"" is a fantasy movie where the characters have more importance than the story, so a good cast is needed to make it work. Well, the movie is benefited by a great supporting cast that includes Ricky Gervais, Peter O'Toole, a truly unforgettable Robert De Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer in what is definitely her great return to mainstream movies. Sadly, the main couple, Charlie Cox and Claire Danes, get easily overshadowed by the supporting cast's performances, specially Cox, whom despite having great natural charm still feels a bit weak in the lead role. Danes fares a bit better, as there are scenes that truly allow her to shine in her character. By the way, I must say that while his role is kind of limited, Mark Strong is excellent as prince Septimus, and delivers some of the best swashbuckling scenes of the last times.Being an accomplished mix of fantasy, romance and comedy in the classic style of fairy tales, ""Stardust""'s worst enemy may be it's very consciously attempt to pay homage to that kind of fantasy tales. In a time where adaptations of high fantasy books like ""The Lord of the Rings"" or ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" are popular, it would be easy to expect ""Stardust"" to follow that pattern, but it doesn't and it may turn off people expecting epic battles instead of romantic swashbuckling. If there's a recent movie that bears any similitude to this film, that one would be ""The Princess Bride"" (also based on a novel), although Reiner's film is certainly grounded even more on the comedy genre. There are details in the lead actors' performances, and the already mentioned troubles in some visual effects, but these are minor quibbles that don't really hurt the film.While not exactly a masterpiece of the genre, ""Stardust"" is still one of the best fantasy films of the last years, and most definitely a worthy adaptation of Gaiman's novel. Whimsical and lighthearted but also witty and clever at the same time, ""Stardust"" proves that not every fantasy film must be about saving the world from an evil dark lord, and that romantic comedies must not be unnecessarily sappy affairs. This excellent tale of fantasy and romance is great for fans of both genres. Comparisons to ""The Princess Bride"" can't be avoided, but this film is almost as good as that fantasy classic.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Fantastic proverbial fantasy,"Stardust is a fantasy about a young man named Tristan, who journeys to collect a fallen star that he and a girlfriend notice in the sky one night. In doing so, he journeys from his ""real world"" town of Wall into a magical land that is hidden behind a wall nearby. But he is not the only one after the star; a band of witches and the son of a King also pursue the fallen star. The star turns out to be a woman that carries an attitude of her own, further complicating the quest. The film has several subplots that are important but too complicated to describe here. When everything comes together, you get a fascinating and elegant structure that forms a perfect fantasy tale.The movie is, above all else, creative. The fallen star visibly glows as she becomes happy and strong, the witches grow old and ugly as they cast magic (which is why they are after the star; the star's heart regenerates their youth), the King has a unique method of choosing his heir, and there are countless magical spells or objects that are remarkable to imagine (Babylon candles, witch hexes, trapped lightning). One of my favorite ideas is that of Captain Shakespeare (perfectly played by Robert DeNiro), a pirate that believes reputation is everything. The imaginative use of the fantasy world and bright characters is the factor that puts it above most movies.Stardust does suffer from occasional acting or dialog problems, although none are too distracting. The music is fantastic; its not too intense or overused, but perfectly suits the style. Depending on your personal tastes, it could be a little slow, but for most people the pacing should feel perfect. The finale was especially put together well, with a few exciting surprises to wrap up all the subplots.I recommend the movie for people of all ages. It has a magical atmosphere that you can't go wrong with. People who love fantasies, dreams, or adventures will like it the most.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Why we should love this movie,"Although Stardust seems to be a fantasy film with predictable ending and average performances, it is certainly not. When i saw the movie, i knew it was going to be one of my favorite movies. And i was right.Stardust is more of a fairytale than an adventure film. It has this magical 'aura' from the beginning to the very end of the movie. The storyline is well written , and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Like every tale , it has some short of morality. Therefore we know in our hearts that the evil brothers won't take the throne but the innocent boy who manages to overcome every obstacle and difficulty he encounters during his journey. We also know that the true love is Yvaine and not Victoria , the material girl who is shallow and manipulative.I have to give extra credits to Claire Danes. She literally shines in this movie. Her eyes have this sparkle that fit totally in her character. Moreover, she and Cox do have chemistry which makes the romance in the film even more notable. The rest of the cast are well known actors and actresses which of course make Stardust an interesting and ''high classed'' movieOverall , the movie is FANTASTIC, the locations magical and the plot interesting.I was very disappointed that the film didn't get nominated for more awards. I have to give at least 9/10 stars for this.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This Star Shines Brightly,"Highly enjoyable, very imaginative, and filmic fairytale all rolled into one, Stardust tells the story of a young man living outside a fantasy world going inside it to retrieve a bit of a fallen star only to find the star is alive, young, and beautiful. A kingdom whose king is about to die has said king unleash a competition on his several sons to see who can retrieve a ruby first to be king whilst a trio of witches want the star to carve up and use to keep them young. These three plot threads weave intricately together throughout the entire picture blended with good acting, dazzling special effects, and some solid sentiment and humour as well. Stardust is a fun film and has some fun performances from the likes of Claire Danes as the star(I could gaze at her for quite some time) to Michelle Pfeiffer(I could gaze at her at full magical powers even longer) playing the horrible witch to Robert Deniro playing a nancy-boy air pirate to perfection. Charlie Cox as the lead Tristan is affable and credible and we get some very good work from a group of guys playing the sons out to be king who are constantly and consistently trying to kill off each other. Mark Strong, Jason Flemyng, and Ruppert Everett plays their roles well in both life and death(loved this whole thread as well). Peter O'Toole plays the dying killer daddy and watch for funny man Ricky Gervais who made me laugh more than anything in the entire film in his brief five minutes(nice feet). But the real power in the film is the novel by Neil Gaiman and the script made from his creative and fertile mind. Stardust creates its own mythology and its own world and it works.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Neil Gaiman is underrated,"This movie was another instance of Neil Gaiman's intriguing imagination. I would describe this film as 90% Terry Gilliam's Adventures of Baron Munchausen with a little bit of the dark side of a number of fantasy films, most recently Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. If you are not familiar with other Neil Gaiman works of other literary forms, check out Smoke and Mirrors (a collection of stories) or his graphic novels (comics) The Sandman and Black Orchid.Stardust has a little bit for everybody, plenty of romance (obviously), slapstick comedy, and wit. The acting and actors are not bad either -- not a lot of movies will include DeNiro, Pfeiffer, and Danes in the same movie all with pivotal roles that they took seriously.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Fairytale, Predictable, Funny, De Niro","If someone asks me to briefly describe ""Stardust"" I would say fairytale, predictable, funny, De Niro. Let me explain you what these words means to me.Fairytale. It is obvious that this is fairytale. It has every element of it. Witches, stars, pirates, magic and everything else. Fairy tales are usually made for children, but I think that these stories are made for everyone who is not afraid to say that he still hasn't grown up completely; that he still has something childish left.Predictable. The whole story was too predictable to me. At the beginning I knew how everything is going to end and that isn't good. I like surprises but I couldn't found any in this movie. I also think that children will enjoy this movie more than teenagers and adults.Funny. Some scenes are funny and very cleverly made. Like the characters of Primus, Secundus (Rupert Everett is great) and all of the king's sons. I am aiming on their ghosts. That was very funny just like characters of Ferdy the Fence (Ricky Gervais), Guard (David Kelly), King (Peter O'Toole) and especially Billy - the goat (Mark Williams). Also I admire Ian McKellen because of his voice (he's narrator of the whole story). I'm just sad that he didn't show his brilliant acting abilities in these movie.De Niro. I left him out in section funny because he is story for himself. I think his character is simply great and all of his scenes are great. His appearance is my favorite part of the movie. For me he was very funny, although someone will think that he's only throwing away his reputation. But why don't we all just admire his scene when he wears women clothes and dance? I did.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Wow, out of nowhere comes a falling star that's a hit!","10 out of 10 and MORE!!Everything from the strangely-effeminate Robert DeNiro to the all-of-a-sudden re-hottiness factor of Michelle Pfeiffer (looking great for 49!). Not since Ladyhawke has she looked this appealing.I knew absolutely nothing about this movie when I watched it, and I was amazed. Great characters, wonderful effects and visuals, along with a very interesting story of a boy who falls in love with a girl, who wants him to prove his love and devotion to her by performing some seemingly impossible task. Oh, so you've heard this one before? Well, not quite like this one is told, at least I don't think so. There's enough danger and darkness in it to keep it from being a Hollywood fairytale. It plays more like a Grimm's fairytale, with humor and a very pleasant love story intertwined in it.I laughed, I felt sad, I was amazed and entertained. I wanted it to end a certain way, and it did. I can't ask much more from a movie, especially one I've never even heard of, and I enjoyed every minute of it. I will be buying this one on DVD, with or without Special Features. It's a hit, with lots of stuff I'm sure I missed the first time through because the kids can't stop talking during it, and I'm looking forward to watching it again and again. Great casting with funny, beautiful people and awesome locations. What a treat!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Surprised,"I was surprised how much I enjoyed this film. It was not the best thing in fantasy I have ever seen but it was really entertaining. A fairly original story well told with excellent special effects. It was a joy to see De Niro in a real departure for him and also thoroughly enjoying himself. Michelle Pfeiffer I love in anything she does and she too has fun with the part ( and a very passable accent too). Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughan have made a good job of the writing but I would have liked a little less modern idiom and something a little more classic in the way that characters speak. The humour is spot on appealing to children and adults alike. Mark Strong gives excellent value as a dark villain, brooding and menacing. I loved seeing all the British comic actors like Mark Williams, Ricky Gervais and David Walliams in small but effective parts, adding atmosphere and amusement to the movie. I have watched it twice now and enjoyed it more the second time. Well worth a viewing.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great fun and romance,"This was an unexpected pleasure. My lady is a big Gaiman fan and a big films-like-this fan, so the fact that we'd be going to see it was a no-brainer. The fact that it might just turn out to be thoroughly enjoyable did not occur to me. So, let's look at the bits: the direction was spot-on, dealing with the soppy and romantic bits with enough comedic or dramatic flair that, though never cynical, they were carried off with the right amount of tongue-in-cheek. The action delivered and the comedy was funny in the right bits. The weakest point of the cast was probably Claire Danes, and even she was engaging, believable and amusing. Pfeiffer's panto dame witch was a hoot, and De Nirowell, watch and learn. And laugh. Genius.Overall, the film had, for me, no weak bits. Well written, cast, acted and shot. Well edited. Wellwell, well everything. Never a work of art, and never a ""film of the year"" contender, but the sort of enjoyable, entertaining and classy film that you wish happened more often than it actually does. They make it look easy but, like a falling star, things this fun are not that commonplace.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Watchable I Guess,"This movie came highly regarded from coworkers who couldn't believe I hadn't seen it. 20 minutes in I knew I wasn't a fan, but when I checked here I was baffled at the high rating/view count! Did we watch the same movie?My issue with Stardust is that it's heavily plot/dialogue based and moves the story line quickly, but it's not a particularly great story. It feels like a stream of clichés delivered by uninspired acting. Everyone in this film is white and cis. There are no surprises. It tries so hard to let you know how dramatic it is. You'll notice the ""epic"" music occurs every other scene.Maybe the strange badness of this movie is part of its charm, but I found it difficult to sit through. It's not completely unwatchable; mildly interesting stuff happens frequently on screen. I'd probably enjoy it more if it wasn't such high production, or had better actors. I really just wanted to turn it off and watch Harry Potter instead.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
More than just a fairy tale,"A philosopher once asked, ""Are we human because we gaze at the stars, or do we gaze at them because we are human?"" Pointless, really... ""Do the stars gaze back?"" Now *that's* a question.And, so begins the unlikely, and incredibly inventive tale that is Stardust.Stardust begins with a young man named Dunstan Thorne (palayed by Ben Barnes, one year before his breakout role as Prince Caspian in the second Chornicales of Narnia film) lives in a town in England known as Wall, for the stone wall that has surrounded the town for 150 years. No one knows what lies beyond the wall, because no one has ever gone beyond the confinement. But, Dunstan Thorne breaks that streak, by venturing beyond the wall, and into the magical realm known as Stormhold. While there, he meets a beautiful woman who he has a short, but memorable affair with. He then returns to Wall, but 9 months later, the elderly gate watchman (David Kelly) arrives at Dunstan's home with a baby, which he claims belongs to Dunstan. The young boy is named Tristan (played as an adult by Charlie Cox). Tristan is smitten with the beautiful Victoria (Seienna Miller), who is dating an asshole named Humphrey. One night, Tristan gets his wish of spending more than a few seconds in with his true love.Meenwhile, the King of Stormhold (Peter O'Toole) lays on his death bed. 3 of his seven sons still remain alive, because the only remaining one is crowned king after their father dies. Two brothers (Rupert Everet and Mark Strong) plot the death of the third brother by pushing home out the castle window. The King tells the two remaining brothers that the first one to retrieve his necklace will be crowned king. He then chucks the necklace into the sky.The necklace hurtles through space, knocking a star out of the sky. The star crashes to Earth, but not before it's seen by Tristian and Victoria. The two make a bet that if Tristian can go beyond the wall and return the star before Victoria's birthday, in a week, then the two will be married.Using a strange candle given to him by his mother, called a Babylon Candle, which posses the power to transport a person hundreds of miles in the blink of an eye, Tristain ends up in the middle of a crater, with a strange girl. The girl, named Yvaine (Claire Danes) turns out to the human form of the fallen star. The two set out on the 100 mile journey back to Stormhold.Along the way, they encounter a cast of quirky character including a witch (played by Michelle Pheifer) who is obsessed with looking young, a band of lightning collecting pirates lead by Captain Shakespeare (Robert De Nero), and a black market trader named Ferdy (Ricky Gervais.)For those who did not see this film when it opened in theaters back in 2007, simply because it looked like a fairy tale, you missed out on one of the most entertaining films of the decade. Yes, it is a fairy tale, but, overall, it is simply an epic fantasy, albeit an epic fantasy where you know that the two main characters are going to get married in the end, director Mathew Vaughn, who made his directorial debut in 2004 with the mob thriller, Layer Cake, starring Daniel Craig, and most recently directed Kick-Ass with Chloe Moretz and Nick Cage, takes some interesting paths in arriving at that point. It wasn't hard for me to fall in love with this movie, which Vaughn adapted from the Neal Gaiman novel of the same name.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An awesome movie for all ages...,"I like Neil Gaiman and I love Jane Goldman. I really didn't know if I would enjoy this as much as I thought I should and was surprised to have been blown away. The movie starts off slow but builds momentum as it goes. It is visually stunning (Cinematographer and Art Director or just the Director I wonder?) with a good soundtrack and is well acted by most of the stars. Ricky Gervais and Robert Deniro over act a bit but there is a chance that it is intentional. I just read that the director is taking on Marvel Comics Thor next, and if he keeps with the fell and quality of this piece, it should pretty sweet. The director also did Guy Ritchie's Snatch and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels which I would recommend to fans of the hardboiled/Brit gangster/dark comedy genre. This is my first IMDb movie review and although it sound as if I am gushing, this doesn't happen often as will be reflected in any other review.as a last note; The volume of the speech track seemed very low as opposed to the sound effects and music tracks. I am wondering if it was the movie or the theater I was in.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beautiful movie,"I would typically give a movie like this an 8/10, but since I hold the Fantasy genre close to my heart, I give it the extra boost.The story is very original, witty, well directed, produced, and some great acting from everyone. Not that the other actors don't typically do good work but I'm pretty sure Robert De Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer being in the movie made everyone step up their game.Claire Danes was impressive as always, and I think she'll become one of those Hollywood legends someday. She is such a talented actress, and always seems to pick amazing and intelligent roles over popular ones. I hold great admiration of her for that reason.If you're a fantasy nut like myself you will enjoy this movie. If you're not well versed in the fantasy genre, I'm sure you'll still find it entertaining. De Niro's eccentric character blew me away, and Michelle Pfeiffer did a flawless job playing the villain.I hope to see Charlie Cox do a lot more movies, because he played the part of a poor boy becoming a man brilliantly. Kudos to the writing for creating a situation that many men can closely identify with in the central character.Well done!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A funny fantasy movie,"An ordinary boy promises a girl from his village that he will retrieve a fallen star as a sign of his true love. This way, he crosses The Wall, venturing into the magical world which existed on the other side. He's in for a big surprise when he finds it, as it wasn't exactly what he expected. Besides this, he isn't the only one after it. A couple of other people wanted it for its heart (which granted eternal youth to the one who ate it) or for its diamond (which granted a true male heir to the magical world's throne his crown).It's a movie which I was tempted to take seriously but I was very surprised when I found out that it was actually presented in a funny and entertaining way. It's unique way of telling a fantastic story made me laugh quite a lot but also kept me eager to discover its ending. As you might expect, the plot is OK, but nothing more, just enough to makes the funny events possible. It is a great movie in my opinion, a must see, but if you're after a movie which doesn't put such an accent on its comical side, this might not be for you.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Princess Bride for the new millenia,"I've been a fan, somewhat, of most of Gaiman's other works. At times I do find him a bit pretentious and tedious. I have the original graphic 'novel' of the Stardust stories and enjoyed them quite a bit. It was with trepidation that I went to see the film version as Gaiman has a very unique writing style that has often found difficulty in translation (the Neverwhere TV series was mediocre at best).I was wonderfully surprised that Vaughn and company were able to temper some of Gaiman's more tedious tendencies and make a wonderful and enjoyable picture.I never found myself feeling bored or distracted and by the end of the movie, unlike most romantic pics, I walked away feeling lighter of step and smiling. I remembered sequences of the film and light touches and happy occasions, despite the seriousness of the threat in the film, with great relish.I also remembered one of the few films of the past that have left me with this same feeling. The Princess Bride. Both were irreverent, to a point, poignant, yet not maudlin, and exciting, but not overdone.This film, for me, is a buy. I don't/can't afford many films but I will be adding this to my library so that I may share this bright and wonderful discovery with anyone willing to listen.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the worst movies i have ever seen,"I have watched the Movie in German dubbing, which i nomally don't do. I did this because i wanted to have a nice evening with my family.I know a lot of Fantasy lore, played World of Warcraft for years and know how trivial this genre sometimes can be. But this one? The plot is so thin it could enter every room without even opening a single doorMr Vaughn must have been fallen on his head while doing this movie...
When you watch a movie and know after five minutes how everything will develop the Screenplay is seriously flawed.It is an approach to merge Pirates of the Caribbean, into an Tim Burtonesque Cinderella kind of Story paired with Lord of the Rings Music, which failed me bigtime. literally everything was foreseeable to a tee.In Addition: All acting is way over the top. Literally everybody is overacting his role wich is ridicules. If this movie was a parody it would be somewhat good but it wants to be taken seriously.The only good thing to me was the Performance of Mark Strong as Septimius, whose overacting was not that much and resembled my feelings regarding the movie while watching it.The comment of My wife about this movie is a very good summarization:
""Well, Honey. From time to time you must watch a really bad movie so you can appreciate the good ones even more""",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stardust,"Stardust is really, really magical. More than the whole Harry Potter series, because you can feel the weariness and the desire to hit the box-office more than they can in Harry Potter movies, while in Stardust all comes from the heart and all is heartfelt. And the viewers feel that: the movie theatre was nearly empty (apart from me and my friends, and some lustful couples), but near the end we all burst into an applause.I think the best actor-actress here has been Michelle Pfeiffer. Villain without redemption, she portrays perfectly the bitchy witch Lamia, and probably she's even prettier than Claire Danes and Sienna Miller, although Mrs. Pfeiffer is nearly 50-something. Charlie Cox won't be a great movie star, but a good actor; Robert De Niro is funny, funny, funny, funny (my friend Federica and me couldn't stop laughing); Claire Danes is a bit false, but works as the falling star Yvaine; Sienna Miller appears for few scenes, and it's better this way: I can't stand her! Costumes, sets, cinematography, all first-rate, not like the computer graphics; to make up for it, we have what an American film fantasy can't offer: good actors, valid screenplay, imaginative direction.I hope they won't do a sequel or a prequel so Stardust won't be spoiled, but Neil Gaiman didn't write a second book and we can heave a sigh of relief.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Mind you don't wear out the wenchStardust,"A magical adventure is just what the summer needed to usher the season into its closing months, leading up to the award contenders' fall/winter releases. With all the sequels and over-the-top action and special effects heavy drivel, an intelligent story steeped in originality couldn't come at a better time. Neil Gaiman and Charles Vess's fantasy story Stardust is a tale ripe for cinematic translation. With the adventure, the surreal, the action, the romance, and the comedy, this film is a direct descendant of classics in the genre like The Princess Bride. After walking out of the theatre, I only had one regretthat I hadn't the opportunity to open up my newly purchased 2007 hardcover edition of the novel yet. If the film was this enjoyable throughout its entirety, I can't wait to check out the source material.I don't want to ruin any story/plot lines in this review. There is a lot going on and many characters to contend with. Rest assured, everyone's motives are clearly laid out and no one seems two-dimensional or a waste of space. Even the small parts, which crop up at many instances throughout, have fleshed out roles, integral to the story thread that they are a part of. Nothing happens without a reason or regard for some future event. Between the journey of a boy for a fallen star to win his love back at home, the quest for the ruby stone that will crown a prince king, the mission for eternal life by a sisterhood of witches, and the story of a boy becoming a man and finding the true meaning of love and sacrifice, Stardust literally has it all. Fate is a big factor with the progression of our characters as an incident that happened eighteen years previous started a chain reaction of events leading to where we begin our tale with young Tristran. All our heroes and villains continue down the same paths, hot on the heels of each other or narrowly missing confrontation at every turn. The magical land of Stormhold is very near our very own England. Only those with the courage to seek out adventure will dare cross over to see what the other side holds.We are treated to a plethora of quirky folk along the journey of Tristran and Yvaine. They soon find out what trouble lies in store for them and, with the help of others, attempt to stay alive so that they can each get back to their respective homes. Charlie Cox is fantastic as our hero with equal parts shyness and bravery. His transformation along the duration of the movie is realistic and he handles the romantic moments with the same poise as the action sequences. Always with a smile, his awkwardness to the world outside his reality leads to some very humorous moments with great comedic timing on his part. As for our falling star, Claire Danes continues to impress me this year. The girl I couldn't stand has been slowly finding a soft spot with me. She is radiant here, and her smile glows enough so that the filmmakers didn't even need to use the halo effect when she is happy.Fans of British film and television will enjoy seeing the numerous cameos included. No matter the name or the top billing, some of the big stars don't last very long. Either way, though, each does his job fully to create the world we are in. We are given nice turns from Ricky Gervais, Peter O'Toole, and Jason Flemyng along with wonderful brief moments from the likes of Rupert Everett and Mark Heap. Michelle Pfeiffer is fantastic as our main villain, yes, but it is Robert De Niro who truly steals the show. You have no idea what to expect from him in the trailers, and you still don't upon his introduction. However, when his true self comes out, it is absolutely priceless.I never would have thought Matthew Vaughn could create such a lush world of comedy and swashbuckling amongst so many fantastical elements, complete with some very nice computer generated work. This is the guy who produced Guy Ritchie's high violence capers and directed his own harsh crime story in the film Layer Cake. To go from almost directing X-Men 3 to than begin work on a Gaiman fantasy story is quite the leap, but he handles it beautifully. I read that Gaiman actually approached Vaughn because he knew him as an entertainment industry guy that he could trust. Not wanting his words to be altered and disrespected, he met with Vaughn and the two came up with a way to make the film true to the novel while also being palatable for Hollywood to embrace. This is truly a story with a lot of heart and I can't wait to watch it again.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Magic again,"Our life continues and we keep on watching films about magical words, far away from reality but with another reality altogether. I haven't seen all the most recent ones, and I won't mention them. Should we worry about all of this similar tales based on novels? Are we tired? I don't have the answer, but I also don't know how filmmaker keep coming across books and novels and take them to the screen. Maybe writers should stop writing for a while, but then again I never care about finding out if the novel a movie's based on is a recent one. Maybe most of them are old.Of the films of the type that are not so recent, ""The Golden Compass"" is one of my favorites, and it presents magical elements in the reality we meet when it begins. In ""The Chronichles of Narnia"", what divides reality from fantasy is a wardrobe; in the amazing ""Bridge to Terabithia"" it's this bridge; in ""Stardust"" (based on a novel by Neil Gaiman) it's a wall.""Stardust"", directed by Matthew Vaughn (in another one of those challenges some directors take by doing something they've never done before) and adapted by Vaughn and Jane Goldman, however, has a difference with the other two films: its hero, Tristan (the natural Charlie Cox), is not a kid. He has 18 years old and possesses the maturity to deal with the destiny prepared for him. From the start (an this is among the film's positive aspects), even before we meet Tristan-when we his father, who also crosses the 'wall' and spends the night with who would be Tristan's mother-we are liberated from the usual surprise kids usually experience when they find magical elements in these films.Tristan is surprised when he meets Yvaine, (Claire Danes, with a great British accent) a girl who is actually a star, but in his face we don't see the wonder of Lyra when using the golden compass, nor the wonder of Lucy when she finds herself standing in snow after closing the wardrobe, if you know what I mean. Therefore, the technical team isn't very worried about wooing us, or so I believe.Because magic doesn't feel so magical for the one individual that needs to transmit it to us, the magic in ""Stardust"" comes from another place: characters and relationships. Unlike some of the constant jumps from one part of the story to another in ""The Golden Compass"", ""Stardust"" stays most of the time close to Tristan, focusing on his adventure and the people he meets along the way.First, there's Yvaine, the hero's love interest, played by Claire Danes with a sweetness we're not used to see in her. She's a serious, independent actress; and what she achieves here shows how wide her range is (even if some of us already knew that). Then there's Lamia, a selfish witch played with mischief by Michelle Pfeiffer; the greedy prince Septimus (Mark Strong), who would do anything to be king; and Captain Shakespeare (a delightful Robert De Niro), who hides a predictable secret.There are others of course, and they are all developed enough for a movie like this one. I won't tell you which role each of them plays in the story (of which I've mentioned almost nothing), because there's also a certain charm to it. But believe me when I tell you that you'll become so involved with the characters that in the end it will be just like a romantic comedy or, more fit for this matter, a classic love story in which you're waiting for Prince Charming to come and save the Princess; whether with a kiss or by getting rid of everyone in his way.Don't doubt for any second that this is how it will be, and you'll forget any trespasses.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The best thing about this film is its catchy theme song by Take That; what does that tell you?,"Clare Danes plays a falling star (although perhaps Robert De Niro, one of the film's other big names, would've been more convincing, given his recent track record) sought after by a love-struck young man (Charlie Cox), a trio of witches (led by Michelle Pfeiffer's evil Lamia), and a prince hoping to become an immortal king (Mark Strong).With a rating of 8.0 on IMDb, a splendid array of dazzling special effects, and a brilliant cast featuring several Hollywood big hitters (plus the inexplicably rich and famous Ricky Gervaisa case of scriptwriter Jane Goldman's husband Jonathan Ross calling in a favour, perhaps?), I was expecting Stardust to be the perfect Saturday night family movie for me, the missus and the kids. Boy, was I wrong.Adapted from a book by cult novelist Neil Gaiman (who wrote the equally disappointing and over-rated Mirrormask), Stardust is a bland, unsatisfying mess of mis-matched moments cobbled together from a plethora of stale fantasy ingredients: wizened witches, a magical kingdom, a hero unaware that he has already found his true love, a benevolent unicorn... etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. Occasionally, there can be found the odd spark of originality, but, more often than not, these moments are quickly extinguished by the film's endless tidal wave of terribly predictable tosh.Another major problem I found with this film is that Layer Cake director Matthew Vaughn desperately wants it to be all things to everyone: an oh-so magical experience for the kids, but a more subversive ride for the adults (for a family film, there is way too much sex and death, and that's coming from a bloodthirsty pervert like me!!!). The end result fails on all levels: it's too meandering and meaningless for children; its mawkish sentimentality should have most adults gagging; and parents will probably be squirming in their seats for the duration, hoping that their children don't understand the more suggestive content or suffer nightmares from the violence.Reading others' comments here on this website, I have noticed that many have likened Stardust to the brilliant The Princess Bride. There's only one thing I can say to that: 'Inconceivable'!",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Funny and surprising,"I just saw this movie at an advance screening yesterday, and I loved it. Admittedly, I have not read the book upon which it's based, but I went with my best friend who is a die-hard Gaiman fan and had reread the book to prepare for seeing the movie. According to her, she had expected to hate the movie, and it is apparently quite different from the book, but she still walked out raving about it. It is sweet and often hilarious (Robert De Niro totally steals the show, but not in a way I've ever seen him do so before). The best parts are the constant surprises: though there are some formulaic and predictable moments, often a situation suddenly develops in a way you did not see coming. The beginning and end are perhaps a little rushed, and the special effects occasionally leave something to be desired, but other than that, I have no criticisms. Excellent performances by all and a really fun ride.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Tolerable translation,"Adapting a much-loved book for the screen is always a risky affair. On the rare occasion when it is done with a slavish regard for accuracy (Harry Potter 1, for example) the result can end up a little on the sterile side. On the other hand, a cavalier approach (Starship Troopers, Kubrick's The Shining) leads to part of the audience wondering how the point of the book could be missed. Even when an adaptation is regarded as successful, there can still be valid reservations (Gimli as light relief in Lord of the Rings, for example).I realise two things - one, it is often the case that changes have to be made because what works on the page doesn't work on screen and, two, the primary motivation of those who put up the not-inconsiderable funding to produce a mainstream feature film is to make profits. That means bums on seats. And that may mean you don't always cater to the sentiments of those who hold the source property particularly dear.I'm a big Neil Gaiman fan. The Charles Vess-illustrated version of Stardust sits proudly on my shelves and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. It tells a fairy story in fairly traditional terms, but tells it with adult sensibilities. I'll confess that I haven't read it for a number of years, and I never did memorise it (although I do recollect that it had the single most effective use of profanity on the printed page which I have ever seen), so it follows that much of the detail is vague in my memory. I was therefore able to approach the film without excessive preconceptions.I saw it in a fairly full cinema with a friend and his young son. I don't recall ever being among an audience which contained so many women in their 30s before, which surprised me.This film satisfied that audience. It satisfied my friend and his son, and it satisfied me. I was surprised at the amount of humour - Gaiman recounts the story in the book in fairly straight-faced manner - and the humour all worked, and worked well: it didn't prevent the story being taken seriously, but it did lighten the tone. This was necessary, I think, because there is a need to maximise audiences, and this fairy story (the tale, as opposed to the telling) pitches as well towards children as it does towards adults. So why exclude a big chunk of audience from the cinema and DVD sales demographic? No, it's not a faithful adaptation. But, with the exception of the inclusion of humour - not necessarily a bad thing - it captured the flavour of the book, and was entertaining in its own right.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stardust (2007),"Directed by Matthew Vaughn. Starring Charlie Cox, Claire Danes, Michelle Pfeiffer, Robert De Niro, Sienna Miller, Mark Strong, Kate Magowan, Jason Flemyng, Joanna Scanlan, Sarah Alexander, Peter O'Toole, Nathaniel Parker, Melanie Hill, David Kelly, Henry Cavill, Rupert Everett, Ricky Gervais, (voice) Ian McKellen. (PG-13)Adaptation of Neil Gaiman's fantasy book about an impressionable young man (Cox) who crosses the barrier between the real world (England) and a magical land (Stormhold) to fetch a fallen star for the shallow woman he adores (Miller); that star happens to be a human-like entity in the form of Danes, and ancient witch Pfeiffer has designs on her as well, to say nothing for the scheming princes who want the gem that Danes carries and an effete sky pirate (De Niro) that captures lightning from storms. Busy and convoluted (without the interest to make it justifiable), stuffed full of skewed humor, forced whimsy, magic spells and charms, special effects, fairy tale romance, high adventure, and more...but director Vaughn lacks the light touch needed to make it work. Pfeiffer is zesty fun, Strong puts the faintest spin on his customary glowering technique, Cox and Danes are lackluster even when one of them glows with starlight, De Niro's vamping is less entertaining than simply surreal (and absent full commitment). Lots of color but limited delight. It is refreshing, however, to find a big-budget fantasy movie this century that doesn't feature a massive battle waged between CGI armies.52/100",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Brilliant fun,"In terms of family fantasy movies I would put this as a close second to 'The Princess Bride'. A wonderful adaptation of Neil Gaiman's novel, with a cast that was superb, especially Robert De Niro as you've never seen him before. A great movie for all the family, watch it, you won't be disappointed.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wonderfully fanciful,"A really enjoyable movie. The acting is good, the cinematography vibrant, the storyline compelling. I can't really fault this for anything, it's not lacking in any area. The storyline is well done, and has a great flow. The characters are well developed and are fun to watch. Quite an enjoyable fantasy.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Flawed but still a must see!,"Well i've been waiting to see this movie for a while and got the chance to see it Friday morning. Overall it was definitely worth the ticket. Despite the fantastic cast Michelle Pfieffer owns this movie. Every minute she is on the screen it lifts what is a pretty good yarn into something really worth seeing. Whenever the picture gets in the danger of straying into Pirates Of The Caribbean territory(more later) She brings the whole thing back on course and is a delight to watch and you can tell she absolutely had a blast doing it. If there was an an Oscar nomination for most entertaining female actress in a movie she would win hands down in fact she should get a nod for a best actress nomination.Besides Pfieffer. Rupert Everett also gets props as the other actor who really brings something to the movie and like Pfieffer he helps propel the narrative along. De Niro is great fun but Danes and Cox are merely adequate as the leads and the movie stalls whenever they have a lot of screen time together.If there is a flaw with Stardust, it's the Pirates Of The Caribbean syndrome. There are occasions where the movie is in danger of losing its way with too much going on and some of it rather extraneous and it's down to Pfieffer or Everett to bring it back on track. Even De Niro's part, though entertaining, is not that necessary.Ricky Gervais has some screen time as a market trader and plays, well, Ricky Gervais.The first half of Stardust is better than the second, mainly because it's tighter,peaking with the movies best scene at an Inn which Pfieffer 'builds'. Stardust could've been a classic instead it's merely very very good and visually it's astounding and it really delivers when so many movies don't. This could well do $200 million+ at the box office. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Romeo and Juliet meets The Wizard of Oz.,"That's not a very good summary line above, but this movie is very hard to sum up. It's just that good, that it defies pigeonholing. All the characters are quite convincingly played, and all seem very real and human, even the ones we only see for a few minutes such as Billy and the guard at the wall. It's dramatic (the final confrontation was engrossing), it's heartwarming (you'll cheer for Tristian) and while it's hilarious (Robert De Niro in an over-the-top comedic role? One more aspect of this film's genius) the humor never overwhelms the drama. Instead they coexist quite harmoniously. If there's been a lot of comparisons to The Princess Bride, well, if the Princess Bride had had modern special effects it would have been this good. And that's the best compliment I know how to give.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Strangely Stitched-Together,"I approach Stardust as someone who has not read the source material, so I do not have the benefit of being thrilled to see familiar characters brought to life on screen. For me, this is a very strangely distant, disjointed film. There are plenty of interesting ideas, clever lines and fantastic images, but the whole simply does not engage me.The problem, I think, is the directing. The angles, shots, editing; they do not assist the actors and visuals in connecting with the viewer (read: me). It feels like an anthology of scenes that are linked by story but not put together in such a way as to comprise a cohesive whole. As someone else said, it is ""episodic."" Perhaps that is how the book is, but if so, then I would question the wisdom in adapting such a structure. It feels like a classic example of something that is only the sum of its parts, not more.As someone who generally enjoys fantasy, is a big fan of Claire Danes and can appreciate a story that plays imaginatively with genre tropes, I expected to enjoy Stardust more. I suppose that to some extent, it just does not synchronize to my sense of aesthetic or sense of humor, the way that it does for other people.Ultimately, I think that this film is simply a matter of acquired taste. Many people find it tremendously engaging, beautiful, inspiring, romantic. I can see the shards of those things, but ultimately I find myself bored by how it is all put together. So in my estimation, Stardust is an interesting bit of cinema, worth watching once, but not one of the classics.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Amazing but overlooked,"The weekend this came out was the same as Rush Hour 3 (which I'm a huge fan of the series) so when my buddy suggested we go see it I was skeptical. Yet this was definitely in the top two movies of summer 07 and it goes in my top 25 movies. This movie has everything a good movie should. Action, romance, suspense and best of all, humor. The only thing that disappointed me about this movie was that it was overlooked by the broad spectrum of movie goers. In a summer with such hits as The Bourne Ultimatum, Spider-Man 3 and as i previously stated, Rush Hour 3, it sorta fell to the bottom of peoples to see lists. I believe that people that aren't fans of fantasy movies will greatly enjoy this flick. This is not your typical fantasy movie such as Lord Of The Rings and Harry Potter. Don't be fooled into being convinced it is such. With an amazing cast and a great directorial flow it is a definite must see. I will have to read the book now that have immensely enjoyed the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wonderful fairytale,"Great acting, great music, interesting story, good directing, what else can you wish for. I've even had a few good laughs. If you're in a mood for a feel-good fantasy film I fully recommend!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
