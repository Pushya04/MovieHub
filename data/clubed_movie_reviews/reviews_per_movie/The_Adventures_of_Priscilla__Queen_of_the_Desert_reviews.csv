A Weaving Pearce Stamp For Collectors,"What unlikely trio to fall in love with, just as unlikely as the landscape. When a movie fits so well without a tag that links it to anything else in its historic film context, it can only be described as a happy accident. Premeditated for sure, but accident nonetheless. Terence Stamp, is an actor with a spectacular career. Varied and surprising. It defies description, but let me try. Peter Ustinov's ""Billy Budd"" William Wyler's ""The Collector"" Federico Fellini's ""Spirit of the Dead"" John Schlesinger's ""Far From The Madding Crowd"" Pier Paolo Pasolini's ""Teorema"" Joseph Losey's ""Modesty Blaise"" Oliver Stone's ""Wall Street"" Stephen Frear's ""The Hit"" Richard Donner's ""Superman"" ""Steven Sodebergh's ""The Limey"" Am I making my point? He is an actor for all seasons, beautiful beyond belief to boot. In ""The Adventures of Pricilla Queen of The Desert"" he unveils another unexpected side to his considerable talents. A Woman. And what a woman, a Meryl Streep with a past and, thanks to director Stephan Elliot, with a future. Dressed by geniuses. More human than ever. He is flanked by two spectacular Aussies. Hugo Weaving (The Matrix) giving a performance of such tenderness that even my brother in law, a homophobic macho man of the first order,loved him. And Guy Pearce (L A Confidential) He is such a beautiful,sexy, funny girl that made me long for a her/he all to myself. Some other monstrously cloned movies were rushed into production trying to capitalize on the success of Pricilla. They all failed miserably and rightly so. Frank Capra, accepting his AFI Lifetime Achievement Award sent a profound and heartfelt advise to young filmmakers. ""Don't follow trends, start new ones"" Well done Mr Elliot. Well done.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"A bitchy, gaudy, outrageous, kitsch comedy classic (8/10)","1994 proved to be rather a good year for Australian movies, with both this and MURIEL'S WEDDING delighting international audiences with their cheeky over-the-top humour, panache, pathos, winning performances, and fun soundtracks.  Both, of course, heavily featured the music of ABBA (Australia has long had a particular love-affair with the Scandinavian quartet - it was probably no coincidence that it was decided to shoot the group's own feature, ABBA: THE MOVIE, during the Australian leg of their 1977 world concert tour).  In MURIEL'S WEDDING the band's music is perhaps treated with more reverence and respect - Muriel Heslop is, after all, a huge fan, and the film itself is of a far more serious, distinctly black nature. PRISCILLA, on the other hand, constantly revels in its own bitchiness and catty humour, and has countless memorable, and in many cases unprintable, lines of dialogue, including stabs at the supergroup - ""I've said it once and I'll say it again - no more f***ing ABBA""; ""What are you telling me - this is an ABBA turd?""  Of course ABBA is merely one of MANY verbal targets for the film's three main protagonists, but far from this alienating us from any of them, we cannot help but be swept along by the sheer garish joy of the entire venture.The basic plot focuses on recently bereaved transsexual Bernadette (a magnificent, hardly recognizable Terence Stamp), who teams up with two younger drag artistes, sensitive Tick/Mitzi (Hugo Weaving) and screaming queen Adam/Felicia (Guy Pearce), so that they can travel half-way across Australia on board an all but dilapidated bus named ""Priscilla"", in order to perform a cabaret act at a remote casino run by an ex-partner of Tick's, soon revealed to be, horror of horrors, a WOMAN!  Along the way they encounter all sorts of absurd situations and individuals almost as strange and unconventional as they themselves are, whilst Bernadette, against her better judgement, falls for gruff mechanic Bob (Bill Hunter, who also features in MURIEL'S WEDDING) that they pick up en route, and in so doing he loses his ""mail-order"" bride Cynthia (Julia Cortez), who in one especially memorable scene does things with ping-pong balls you just don't want to imagine!The performances are really the thing here - Terence Stamp (who won numerous accolades for his cast-against-type labours) is amazing and totally credible as the quietly dignified transsexual, and it is hard to believe that Weaving and (especially) Pearce have not worked as flamboyant, lip-synching drag queens all their professional lives!  The gaudy, outrageous costumes won a well-deserved Oscar, and the photography of the barren, surreal landscape is also masterful, as is Stephan Elliott's creative direction and hilarious, ultimately poignant script.  The soundtrack may not be to everyone's taste, but it has enough camp classics to satisfy anyone yearning to relive the tacky heyday of the '70s - including ABBA's ""Mamma Mia"", the Village People's ""Go West"", and Gloria Gaynor's superb ""I Will Survive"", given a gloriously inventive rendition to a bunch of appreciative aboriginals, with one of their number joining in most enthusiastically.A true kitsch classic, then - well worth re-visiting, again and again ... and again.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Take a letter, Maria",When few countries were pushing the boundaries of the LGBTIQ community this beautiful movie tested the waters. It made Australia grow up in an era when economically everyone wanted to go back to a more comfortable time. It came out around the same time as Muriel's Wedding which is equally about a run down family of characters who are better when they come together. This movie is a prime example of Australian cinema.,8.0,Anonymous,Music
My road trip adventures in a bus never matched this amazing tour.,"A relatively low budget Australian film about drag queens took the world by storm, almost caused a riot at the Cannes film festival and drove a million young queens to the dressing up box in the hunt for sequins, sparkles and pink flip-flops! The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of The Desert gave us such classic lines as, ""Just what this country needs, another cock in a frock on a rock!"" and ""Listen here you mullet, why don't you just light your tampon and blow your box apart, it's the only bang you're ever going to get, sweetheart""It is without exception the best and arguably the most successful drag queen movie of all time, breaking box office records and capturing the top of the charts in numerous countries around the world. It was an Academy award winning extravaganza of glitter, glam and lip-syncing with the most outrageously camp costumes the world had seen outside Madame JoJo's or Funny Girls! Uproariously funny and yet deeply affecting it proved to be way more than just a camp outing of tried and tested queer humour.The late eighties was a bit of a coming of age time for Australia's gay population, especially Sydney, it really came alive and blossomed into one of the bigger gay populations in the world. Australia has a reputation for all the big butch manly men, which considering how the modern nation of Australia started, would seem pretty accurate, only it's not, it's completely different, ever so much more vibrant and colourful. It is that vibrancy, that colour and that hopefulness that is so perfectly depicted in Priscilla.Stephen Elliott, the director and writer, who incidentally has a small cameo in the movie as a cute door boy in Alice, says he saw drag shows in other places, like the US and England, which were essentially men in dresses lip-syncing to other peoples songs. In Australia they did the same, but took it in a completely new direction, it became a completely new strange variety of theatre, so much so that he even used to go to drag queen jelly wrestling, pushing the envelope to the maximum. It was this experience along with watching a drunken drag queen at the Sydney gay Mardi Gras, which gave birth to the movie idea, which took hardly any time at all to write.From the very opening you know this film has deep rooted soul, first shots of Hugo as Mitzi mouthing the words to the poignant Charlene song, 'I've been to paradise, but I've never been to me' give the impression of an emotively sad song, yet this is so rapidly defused by the appearance of a lethargic priest and Felicia nursing a baby rubber chicken. You have left in no doubt after that that is no ordinary Australian movie and the jokes and gags just tumble on from there in rapid succession. However it's not all giggles, there are some key moments of high emotion - seeing the graffiti sprayed on the side of the bus in pink paint the morning after shocks the trio along with the audience and strikes a chord with those of old enough to have lived through a time of such prejudice and discrimination and how true those word seem when they ring in our ears, that no matter how tough we think we are, such things still hurt.There are deeply moving scenes, such as the gay bashing of Felicia and the confrontation between Mitzi and his son in Alice, which really seem seep through the comedy to dance in your heart and make you fall in love with the film. ï¿¼ One of the key aspects of the movie is the superb casting; Terrence Stamp previously typecast as your typical British villain, took a risk on the role of Bernadette and knocked it out of the water in a downbeat, down trodden put upon yet completely resilient way. Hugo Weaving is the less visually striking member of the trio and the central character of Mitzi, who really is the lynch pin between the two worlds. The role of Felecia is taken by the simply stunning Guy Pearce who had literally just left long running soap Neighbours, in which he played goodie two shoes Mike and was an inspired choice and oh so pretty. Guy's superb performance takes the movie to new heights and is so good that the he has had trouble-convincing people he is actually straight in real life, even to this day. Bill Hunter a massive Australian character actor shines outstandingly as the gruff and butch Bob, the mechanic and unlikely love interest for one of the three.Priscilla is a beautiful magical combination of humour, catty bitchiness, kitsch costumes, stunning disco soundtrack and subtle sentiment with provocative thoughtful scenes and a delicate brush of honesty. Some jokes are obvious so too is the stereotypical veneer of the characters upon first glance, yet look a little deep as the film rolls on, you see more and more layers being unpeeled and exposed in a gently moving and comical way. It is one of the most enjoyable gay movies of all time; each subsequent viewing cements that sentiment further into fact.

Thoroughly Entertaining...,"All three leading ladies and their performances are outstanding. The story is very amusing, quite often hilarious but also grounded with the prejudices they encounter on their journey.

A Movie You Can Watch Over and Over,"This is a great movie!  Not only are the actors wonderful but the dialogue keeps you watching the movie over and over again because you missed a great line the last time!  The musical numbers are worth watching alone, but combined with the story and all the sub-plots and the funniest lines I have heard in a long time (The ABBA turd convo cracks me up every time), this is a movie to buy and watch over and over when you need to be entertained as well as dazzled!!!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Queer classic,"When I first saw this film in my adolescence I have to admit I wasn't a very big fan. I found it to be depressing and a bit droll. After revisiting it so many years later I have a slightly better opinion of it. Looking at it with different eyes I appreciate aspects of it that I didn't before. If you haven't seen this queer classic it tells the story of a single gay dad who hasn't seen his son in ages and gets contracted by his former wife to do a drag show at a resort in the middle of the desert. The man is surprisingly Hugo Weaving of the Matrix films and he brings along his two friends. An aging transvestite whose just lost her lover played by a solid Terence Stamp and a flirty, young, charasmatic drag queen played by a surprisingly engaging and sexy Guy Pearce of Memento. The film tracks their journey across the desert and all the mishaps that go along with it. In the end I definitely enjoyed it more but it left me wanting a bit more character and story development. That being said it's still a wild, fun stylish ride with a great soundtrack.Budget: $2M
Box Office: $29.7M7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Improbably great,"...and I don't say ""great"" lightly. This isn't merely some tired road comedy in drag, it's a fun, at times surprisingly moving story.Part of my immense surprise comes because I'd never really understood the appeal of drag shows. While I'm not sure I'm any bigger a fan, I definitely found myself drawn into the little universe created here.The central characters are real people who manage to play to stereotypes without succumbing to them. I was frankly amazed by Terence Stamp, an actor who has made a career playing dangerous, macho types, and made a surprisingly compelling and believable ageing transsexual. The novelty quickly wore off; it was one of those rare performances that was just totally without affect. Honestly, one of the best performances I've ever seen.Fun, as I expected, but there's a genuine affection and depth here. A very pleasant surprise.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Here is to all free-spirited and open-minded people!,"While I wasn't crazy about the movie, I could still really appreciate it for everything it did- and the way it handled its themes.Seems that it are mostly the persons who can't handle the movie its themes are the ones who don't like this movie. A movie about cross-dressing homosexuals just clearly isn't everybody's cup of tea. But the homosexual aspects of the movie really wasn't to me what the movie was all about really. I saw it more as an ode to all of the free-spirited and open-minded people of this world. People who are simply doing their thing because they like it and feel comfortable that way, no matter what everybody else says or thinks about it and those who respect people for being 'different' and not living by the normal rules and standards. It's all what makes our world even more divers and also more of a joy to live on.And that's really the foremost thing I got out of this movie. The story itself seems to be secondary, since it's a quite simple one and can be seen as a typical road trip movie, in which the main characters come across all kinds of persons, get into trouble, while traveling through Australia. And as far as road trip movies go; this isn't the best example of it that I have ever seen. You feel that with some better writing the movie could had been a bit more fun and clever and witty to watch.One thing I also wasn't too fond about was its pacing. It's often going way to fast, which causes some things to not develop- or make an impact properly enough. You could perhaps 'blame' it on the fact that this is of course different from a normal Hollywood movie, since it's of course an Australian production, that uses a completely different approach and way of storytelling. I often have similar sort of problems with other Australian movies, so perhaps it's fair to say that I'm just not the biggest fan of Australian cinema.But still another thing that I can highly respect and appreciate this movie for is its acting, or rather said the courage and professionalism that the actor's show in this movie. The three main leads, who are all in drag throughout basically the entire movie, are being played by Hugo Weaving, Guy Pearce and Terence Stamp. All three very manly and tough looking men in real life, who also have families of their own and clearly aren't homosexual. Yet they have absolutely no problem with it to show themselves from a more vulnerable side and also aren't afraid to walk, talk and act like as if they are actual females. I really respect it when an actor does this and plays a character that is totally the opposite of who he or she is. You could of course question it though if Guy Pearce and Hugo Weaving would had still agreed on their roles if they had been the well known and much acclaimed actors that they are today. Not that they now would complain about this movie though, since it was the one that put them in the international spotlights and they have appeared in many big Hollywood projects ever since. The haven't forgot about their home country though, since every now and then they still appear in an Australian production. It was also refreshing by the way to hear them speak in their natural accents but it's arguably still Terence Stamp who steals the show, as the elder, once very successful drag queen, with still the very deep and distinctive Terence Stamp voice.So ultimately not a perfect movie, that I could still really enjoy and appreciate for the way it was handling and celebrating its themes.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Music
This is comedy,"This movie made laugh and does so every time I see it again. Perhaps it won't go down in history as a timeless classic is does deserve it so much. The original premise is a weird one, about transsexuals traveling through the desert of Australia. The sense of humor is very wicked and thank God for small favors not restrained to Hollywood standards. And I've never watched a game of table tennis without a smallish grin on my face which has little to do with the game in it self.The actors are great an absolute anti choice in the matters of typecasting . The scenery of the movie is great, the bus in the desert are two extra players that give this movie an extra beaut. The extra castmembers are great and unforgettable. Ever since when I watch an episode of Flying Doctors or things in his sort I wonder about the nutty folks out there. the costumes are great and gobsmacking, they perform very well in the musical numbers.I showed this to my mum, after the initial shock she was very amused and agreed with me that it was a very funny movie.I will watch this movie a lot in the future, why?? It keeps me laughing every time.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
finally ...,"Two drag queens (Guy Pearce as bitchy Felicia, and Hugo Weaving as Mitzi) and a transsexual (Terence Stamp, marvellous as the widowed Bernadette) make a trip to Alice Springs in a pink bus called Priscilla.Cue a soundtrack of mostly Abba songs (plus an off-the-cuff 'I Will Survive', and C E Peniston's 'Finally' - a great set-piece) and three towering performances.  From the initial hilarious premise we follow the trio through the Australian desert and meet the various inhabitants of places they pass through.  It remains fast-paced and touching within the comedy.  Wonderful.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Don't Come the Raw Prawn With Me...,"Seeing a cult film in a cultish setting with a fan audience (in this case, a cinema tent at a festival) is a fine way to see the cracks in Priscilla melt away and the charm take over totally. It's deeply problematic but also vibrantly shot and with some real show stopper moments. Certainly large chunks of it belong in the past, but despite how well-trodden the cult has become in the decades since it still has the capacity to shock and subvert. It's welded now into a memorable viewing experience anyway, and whatever else time does to it, it'll always have that for me.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Ironically, it drags","This is one of those inoffensive and mildly entertaining little movies that strive to make you to like them more. But like so many others, it's material isn't strong enough to successfully fill a couple of hours.The pitch is promising: three drag queens drive a bus through the Outback from Sydney to Alice Springs. They run into lots of trouble - with homophobic locals, with the engine, with their pasts.The real trouble is with the dialogue. The leads are fine (though Pearce's continual campness becomes tiresome), but the one-liners and epithets feel forced where they should be casually thrown away. Characters shouldn't laugh at their own gags.Writer/director Elliott also feels the need to pile on the pleasingly incongruous shots of flamboyant drag costumes against stark desert backgrounds like so much cheap make-up. For a movie about self-confidence and just being yourself, it all seems very insecure with itself.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
I'll never look at those three guys the same way again...,"...and that's a GOOD thing. Basically, before I truly became aware of ""Priscilla"", I had only thought of its three central actors as just regular, boring guys who were fine enough at acting, but really weren't anything special. Wrong. I had heard about this mysterious movie once or twice, but had no idea who was in it, nor what it was about (beyond the rather vague concept of drag queens/transvestites), and when I decided to read more about it, and find out who was in the cast - SURPRISE! Guy Pearce (of whom I had had a bad first impression when I discovered him in that travesty ""The Time Machine""), Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith himself!!!), and Terence Stamp (whom I don't think I ever saw in any films, but whom I still knew a fair bit about)! How genius is that? I had to see this to believe it, and when I did, I was not let down! Beautiful scenes, costumes, dialogue and music made this probably one of the most interesting and memorable movie experiences of my life! I wasn't the least bit uptight about it (as some people were turned off by the flamboyant behaviour and distasteful jokes, which I found refreshingly great!), and delighted in the campy antics of this fantastic trio! It's a beautiful, feel-good comedy that I recommend to anyone with a catty sense of humour (and a VERY open mind).",,Anonymous,Music
Toward the Acceptance of Diversity,"This is a film that every straight person should see. The screenwriter created three drags queens from the cloth of everyday life Â an older person (who happens to be transgendered), an average guy next door and a pretty muscle boy. You can say that this film is about ""the great reach of little lives"" (a comment originally applied by Donald Spoto to Tennesee Williams' ""The Glass Menagerie."") We also see, in Anthony Bellerose's story, that sexuality is not a cut-and-dried affair. Underneath it all, we see that these people aren't much different from those we meet ion our daily lives. A screening of ""Priscilla"" would do more good than a hundred lectures to high school kids on the acceptance of diversity.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

"It's weird, but in a funny way","Although this movie got a lot of good criticism when it was first released, I never watched it until now. I always thought that this wasn't a movie for me. I'm a straight guy and I was convinced that I didn't want to see weird men dressing up in women's clothes, play-backing seventies hits from ABBA or other groups. That's why I never rented it, but when it was shown on television, I decided to give it a try anyway. I could always switch it off if it was too terrible. But I didn't, I kept watching it until the end.The story that is told in ""The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"" brings us to two drag-queens and a transsexual who will go to a resort in Alice Springs, a town in the middle of the Australian desert, to perform a drag show. As they travel from Sydney to Alice Springs, they encounter all kinds of people, but are almost always the subject of misunderstanding and hate, because the locals don't always understand or like the way these three men act. When the engine of Priscilla, that's how they called their bus, breaks down in the middle of the desert, they paint it lavender, waiting for help to come. Then they meet Bob who takes them for what they are and who fixes the problem with their bus. He travels on with them, protecting them for more problems...If you are looking for a not so average comedy, then you definitely should give this movie a try. A road movie about two drag queens and a transvestite isn't exactly something that you'll find every day, let alone a good one. And I admit that I started feeling completely different about this movie once I was seeing it. OK, it may not always be perfect and sometimes it is completely over-the-top, but it also offers some excellent laughs. And seeing Guy Pearce, Hugo Weaving and Terence Stamp in this kind of roles is already great fun on itself. Normally you wouldn't expect them in such a role, but they did a very fine job.All in all I guess you have to be incredibly homophobic to hate this movie. I'm not saying that it's my favorite comedy of all times, but the story, the acting, the humor,... made it all worth watching. I give this movie a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

A fabulous & colourful romp that inspires my neverending gayness.,"Oh how I adore this film ! I found it to be enchanting & inspiring. This film is sooo special to me, I took my boyfriend Jun to see it & I must say that we hardly kissed at all as this wonderful piece of cinema was far too absorbing to take your eyes off the screen, not even for one of Juns sexy smooches.The costumes were the highlight, I was in awe of their delicious boldness & I continue, even to this day, to be inspired by this movies wardrobe ( or should I say 'closet' - tee hee ).On the man candy side, I couldn't get enough of Guy Pearce & his cheeky pout - what a saucy monkey. The other actors were equally good, but they lacked the hot cheekbones & bulging muscles of the gifted Guy Pearce.I would recommend this film to any man, gay or otherwise, as it is truly remarkable.

"A Meaningful Riot,","The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert is a fantastic movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding cast. It is a really funny film, as we follow a group of drag queens lip syncing to famous pop songs while journeying across Australia. However, it is also has a very meaningful, heartfelt message, as it embraces the idea of doing what makes you happy, whether people like it or not, cause it is your life and you choose how you live it.The only issue I really had is that I felt we did not get to learn enough about the three main characters before they begin their journey. Very little is actually said about their past or personal life, which would have helped us connect with them more before their adventure begins.The three leads are stellar, it was a huge risk on all of their careers, as straight actors, to be taking on these roles, and they could not have performed them with more liveliness. Terence Stamp keeps a serious demeanour throughout, Hugo Weaving's characterisation is fantastic, while Guy Pearce's wild and energetic personality is the highlight of the film for me.There is nothing quite like it, big fun with big heart.

Dressing Well Is The Best Revenge,"This is a visually interesting and attractively well-designed movie. The clothes in particular are really inventive and fun and the Australian desert makes for some intriguing and disparate vistas and backgrounds, particularly for the dance routine at the Aborigine camp. Some of the set pieces, however, cannot be considered realistic and it is clear that they are merely moving the plot progress or creating a situation in order to provide an excuse for plot development. It should have been more organic and natural.Finally, I gave it an above average review because the performances were so strong; it was totally believable that Guy Pierce and Hugo Weaving were both not only gay men and serious drag queens, but talented drag queens at that, no easy task indeed.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
FANTASTIC MOVIE,"This film goes down in my books as one of the best. The emotion involved with everything that happens is just heartwrenching. One moment i was laughing the next in tears. I would reccomend this film to anyone who wants a realistic look at gay life in the 80's. It's amazing how narrow minded people can be, but these people show us the true meaning of life, love, fatherhood, and most of all friendship and loyalty. Using humor and good natured prodding of controversial issues, the filmmaker is able to break through the barrier of bias, and get to the core of these three magnificent people.

Touching dazzling movie with some comedy sprinkled on top,"In honor of pride month, I decided to watch a movie I could not believe I have never seen before. That movie is of course the adventures of Priscilla Queen of the desert. I can honestly say that it is one of the best LGBTQ films ever made. And just because this is an LGBTQ movie doesn't mean that that's all that it's, it's not. It's is a road trip movie about these three individuals. It's stars Hugo Weaving, Guy Pearce and Terence Stamp. Weaving and Pierce play to gay drag queens and Terence Stamp plays an aging transgender woman. They all three decide to get in a bus that they have named Priscilla and drive across the desert to some drag shows they will be performing in in a town called Alice Springs. On this road trip they come across many things: homophobic assaults, they learn secrets about one another, and they get to know each other better through deep meaningful conversations. That's why I call it a touching road trip movie sprinkled with comedy, it is not strictly a comedic film, I would first call it a drama before I would a comedy. The acting is really what holds this movie up, along with the good dialogue and the fantastic costumes (for which the film won an academy award). The one that really shines the most in this movie is Terence Stamp, his performance as the transgender woman Bernadette was absolutely flawless, personally I think he should've gotten an Academy Award nomination. Hugo weaving and Guy Pearce were also very very good in their roles, it's just that Terence stamp really outshined everyone. Guy Pearce was not only very good looking in this role, but he was also very flamboyant and cheery character, so he was kind of the comedic relief of the film, not that the movie was making fun of his being gay or being flamboyant, he was just a very funny character, which was good because it's always good to have a balance of good touching drama with some comedy. The costuming absolutely deserved that Academy award win, they were fabulous and just perfect for the drag shows. The soundtrack is great too. All in all, this is a very well made film and I suggest it to any and everyone. 9/10. Happy Pride Month everyone!!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
An Incredible Austrlian Cult Film,"Two drag queens (Guy Pearce and Hugo Weaving) and a transsexual (Terence Stamp) travel across the desert to perform their unique style of cabaret.Guy Pearce is pretty amazing here. Although not gay, he plays the stereotypical gay guy to a T. He takes what we saw from Robin Williams in ""The Bird Cage"" and improves upon it, making it all his own. This is more believable than what Williams did.Terence Stamp is also incredible, playing a total bad-donkey. He is apparently supposed to be transgender, but looks like an old man in a wig. That actually makes him all the more interesting, because it bends the genders in a fun and entertaining way: a man transitioning to a woman, while still maintaining a tough, rough, and pugilistic exterior.

The kind of movie that makes you proud to be Queer and glad to be alive,"I must confess, I was not looking forward to this movie. As members of the LGBT community go, I am pretty straight. I don't have a trace of flamboyance about my Queerness, I've never been to a pride parade, and though I have been to a drag show, it was just the one time. Though if they appeal to you, more power to you, I say, but those things are not my cup of tea. But damned if I didn't smile more during this movie than I have at any other movie in recent memory.Why did it appeal to me so much? I'm not sure, aside from the fantastic sense of humor, appealing characters, insightful script, gorgeous cinematography....oh, wait, did I answer my own question after saying that I couldn't? Crazy...This is the most pathos-filled comedy I've ever seen since the days of Chaplin. I was drawn into the world of the central trio from the start because this movie, more than any other, captures the poignancy of being proud to be yourself in a world that is not always welcoming. The three leads project the joy of being authentic in a way that almost makes you wonder about the actors that played them and their true selves (no, the movie is not politically correct in the world of 2022 because a cis man plays a trans woman-something I object to in every other movie, but I was shocked at how little I cared about that by the film's end). We could all learn a lesson from these characters.Furthermore, this is one of the few movies about a trans character that I have seen that allows the trans person to be a fully-fledged character, instead of just being shy and timid. Indeed, she gets some of the best lines in the whole picture, including an insult that shatters records for me in terms of making me laugh (I can't wait to use it myself someday!). Too many movies let their trans characters fall into stereotypes, but Bernadette is a whole person with a whole personality, and this alone made me love the movie.It also doesn't pull any punches about what an intolerant world this can be for LGBT people. Or how it can feel to be slapped by that world. However, it also does not dwell on this, and when homophobic bullying sets in, the main characters (eventually) brush themselves off and carry on being who they are. Like Wile E. Coyote after a run-in with the Road Runner. (Why do they do it? They don't have much of a choice and they know it, so they choose to carry on with style).",10.0,Anonymous,Music
On target all the way,"Irreverant look at three female impersonators who travel across the Australian outback learning to deal not only with outside world, but also themselves, and each other. Insightfully examines the complexities of the 'alternative' lifestyle in a sharp,witty, fast paced style. The three leads play their parts quite well.

Completely and Utterly Unique,"Most people use the word ""unique"" in an off-handed and lazy manner, applying the word to anything that is a little bit unusual but not downright original. Well, The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert is truly unique in every sense of the word.What is more unique, I ask, than two drag performers and a transgender woman journeying through the Australian Outback in a camper van during the mid 90s? I've never seen anything similar. Not even remotely.Priscilla is a journey into the lives of drag performers at a time when being such was a risky pursuit. It is a dangerous job that could mean serious injury if one is not careful. There was a lot of stigma attached to being a drag queen, let alone a transgendered woman in that era. One had to be careful about where and when they held shows and who they allowed in their viscinity.This movie's greatest gift is that it shines a light on drag and transgenderism, bringing a humanity to these stigmatized identities at a time when it was sorely needed. There are tons of heartfelt moments here, such as when they are inducted into the tribe of natives and put on a show that lasts through the night. It is such a display of warmth and acceptance that was truly beautiful and moving. Another powerful moment is when they enter a bar and are immediately told to leave, only to change everyone's mind and create a more fun and lively atmosphere than probably existed ever before.It's not just a film about increasing LGBTQ+ visibility though. It's downright fun and we are witness to all of the crazy antics that go on in such a troupe. Bernadette is a master at disarming ill-intentioned people who wish to bring harm to her and her allies. She is like the matriach of the troupe.Each character feels fully fleshed out and deeply human. We come to feel deep care for each of their journeys to where they are now through flashbacks to pivotal moments in their lives.The use of colourful costumes amongst the sparse, desolation of the Australian Outback was a very good choice. The juxtaposition of these elements creates vivid and impactful visuals. Indeed, those barren lands seem like an ideal place to live out one's deepest drag fantasies.The Australian banter was difficult for me to completely integrate into my own cultural understanding (Canadian) but it doesn't really matter because the underlying message came through quite clearly: that the LGBTQ movement is not just a bunch of clowns to jeer at from the sidelines, but people that are fully human and deserve just as much love and acceptance as anyone else.It's truly a gem of a movie and surely a required viewing for the LGBTQ community. It can teach us a lot about not only performers, but about ourselves and it can powerfully alter our perceptions in a more inclusive direction.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Wow,"I saw this movie and couldn't do anything but laugh! I thought that it was SO FUNNY! I must admit, ""Adam"" was also a major attraction if u get me.... Wow, what a body..Well enough of that!

But Priscilla on the other hand... Now that was something that made me laugh! I'm not a drag queen but it was something that i would watch and do nothing but giggle at. The characters were well written and there are some true scenes in it, e.g. the ""queer bashing"" :( I just wish all queers could stand up for themselves as well as ""Ralph"" did!I thought however, that there was some bits where i was like ""Oh, My GOD!!!!"" This movie is outrageous and fun, it makes me laugh and i heard the ""Bisto song"" at the end. (if your from England you should know what i'm talking about, and if not SORRY!)

Best Aussie movie,"This is my favourite Aussie movie of all times - a classic hilarious comedy in Australian tradition.There are 3 aspects of the movie which make it such an outstanding entertainer.Firstly, it's the brilliant screenplay by writer-director Stephan Elliott about 3 drag queens - a gay, a bisexual and a trans-sexual - from Sydney going on a bus to Alice Springs, a distance of over 2000 Kms to the centre of Australia, for a public performance. It's a road movie unlike any I have seen before, outrageously funny in one moment and poignant and touching the next.Second, the performances by the 3 lead actors are outstanding. It's hard to pick one which has outshone the others. My personal favourite, like a lot of others, is Terence Stamp as the trans-sexual.Third, the stunning costumes are worth watching just for themselves. Some of the scenes in the movie where we see the characters in their wildly colourful costumes against the background of an outlandish landscape are breathtakingly beautiful and memorable.It's a movie one can see many times, and enjoy it every time.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"pretty, but stupid and shallow","Terence Stamp can carry off anything, but this is still a shallow one-dimensional movie.   It's nice to look at - so are the actors - and if you're into drag queens, I guess you might like it a lot, but the plot and characters are as thin as cardboard.   It's one of those politically correct movies that warps everything else in order to make a 'minority lifestyle' seem warm and cuddly.  It gets a lot of mileage out of bitchy dialogue, which is amusing in this sanitized form, I guess.Ninety percent of the action is parading around in gaudy costumes in incongruous situations.   The dramatic content is a token appendage - they hardly try to get you to take it seriously.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
My take on Priscillianism,"Exemplify a wacky dress without being tacky, and beyond, could be the film's tag. Whether you wear it on a frock or naked, should be aimed at people who say the film is OK, nicely done and frothy and all, but without much to it. Wrong. Wrong viewers they are that downplay the film's witty heart.I do not think there has ever been a film that delivers its ethos in the tag-line ""a cock in a frock on a rock - that's what our country hardly needed"". The smashing alliteration outwits the scenario-in-a-capsule phrase of this more kind-than-kin road movie. It must have to do with something else. Queering the deadpan or deadpanning the queer? I am not sure I can fathom Terence Stamp's take on delivering what he says.All three actors bless the idea of casting and based on their choice there should be a new kind of lifetime achievement award, bestowed by the Vatican, for the film should be included in all discussions of trinitarian discourse: Bernadette as a very dignified Holy Spirit or as trans-gendered Godhead, Adam as a reckless Holy Spirit or Son in drug-fueled high heels, Tick as Father, for sure. It should - the least - provoke a wave for re-evaluating the doctrines of Priscillian, the early Church heretic, or martyr depending on your appreciation of controversial matters, who was the first person in the history of Christianity to be executed for heresy: he mostly lived in the desert like Adam, Bernadette and Tick, but being a strict ascetic, had failed to watch the film and be converted.It is a sly achievement to which one gives up and surrenders intelligently, when you realize that the film is a tender plea for man's precarious status, his always tenderness-seeking or wildly avoiding identity: the women in the film range from the bully in the bar to the inane, almost extra-terrestrially squeaking runner, to the unintelligible vagina performer, and when in the and at last we encounter a human being, Tick's wife, the rich ambiguities are neither explained nor skimmed: we now understand that these women with their full range of caricature and sexual being, are there to put into relief the three characters' embattled manhood (Tick trying to sell the odious face-creams totally drunk in that bar, by his drawl rightfully pronounces the product: woe-man): Bernadette still clutches to some core of enjoyment in what concerns her pre-operation self, as her rage whenever Adam calls her by her earlier name (and this somehow counter-contrasts, to call the effect by that name, with Adam's counter-molestation flash-back), Ralph, erupts, Tick has an amazingly human face charting all delicate and anxious hesitations concerning what is to be a father, drawing a line to procreation, and this, in turn, has an uncanny resonance to and with the fact that Adam seems peculiarly parentless. Perhaps it is this difficult to grasp effect that from the three performances the one that stayed with me was Pearce's with all its reckless abandon.Terence Stamp has not demonstrated that he is from another solar system that well even in Pasolini's ""Theoreme"" - it is surely a system of stellar poise and dignity, and we rarely see that around here; and how difficult it is to have Hugo Weaving's strong, unmissable face playing a humane character without something leaking into false notes. The story is perfect in being a pilgrim's progress and its queering of it: Stephan Elliott touched genius with this film, and so did the leads, and so do we. Thank you.",,Anonymous,Music
Camp classic,"Three drag queens take a road trip from Sydney to mid-Australia to perform on stage. Also, one of them has a secret that's revealed at the end. Nothing new plot-wise, but it has a fantastic soundtrack (Gloria Gaynor, the Village People, Charlene, etc.), unbelievable costumes (a deserved Academy-Award winner) and three great performances. Hugo Weaving is good, Terence Stamp is excellent as a transsexual--this couldn't have been an easy role, but he pulls it off. Guy Pearce is absolutely gorgeous as the youngest of the bunch. Also, there are more than a few scenes of him shirtless or parading around in his little Calvin Kleins--definitely worth seeing (I know he's straight, but I can dream can't I?). Also the bitchy banter is funny (if occasionally too caustic) and they don't ignore homophobia and, at the end, present a little boy who is totally comfortable with his dad being a drag queen and his mother bisexual (it's suggested). Also, back in 1994 this helped me get over a very painful breakup. If you're gay, you've got to see it. One of the best gay films of all time.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

This is Hugo Weaving before he was Smith and he is playing as a drag queen. No kidding, he's playing a drag queen! Not only you get to see Hugo Weaving as a drag queen but also Guy Pearce and Terence Stamp. They're all playing drag queen. Now how often do we see Hollywood actors playing as a drag queen?Mitzi (Weaving), Felicia (Pearce) and Bernadette (Stamp) decides to go for a performance in a Hotel. They travel on bus across the desert and it breakdown in the middle of nowhere. They discovered that the owner for the hotel they are performing for is owned by Mitzi's wife. They soon meets Bob who help them fix the bus. They bring him along on their journey to fix the bus. Soon they made it to the hotel and Mitzi finds out that he has a son and he doesn't want his son to know what he is working as.This is a wonderful sing-a-long movie with lots of laugh out loud jokes. I watched this movie once and I've already end up singing along with the movie. The soundtrack of the movie is great. Lots of famous songs like 'Mamamia' or 'I Will Survive'. This is a soundtrack worth buying. The characters are well crafted and the acting is brilliant. It is so good and so believable they deserve a best actor award.The camera works are simple but great. It matches well for the film. The editing is great for some of the scenes like the performances scenes. The art direction for this film is excellent. The costume for the performance scenes are well done. The script is well written with lots of jokes that can make you laugh till you drop. You will not get bored of the jokes.I hardly watch movies about drag queen and I'm not really a fan of it but after watching this movie, I like it even if it is not my cup of tea.

Funny thematic comic offering over three weird Drag Queens in the Australian desert tour!!,"Who would have through that Terence Stamp, who often used to portrait from those tough Mobster or sophisticated high society businessman, Hugo Heaving as relentless manhunter in Matrix and Guy Pearce in the famous L.

Am I the Only One Who Thinks Guy Pearce Makes a Hot Woman?,"The surprise indie hit about three drag queens who go on a voyage of self discovery. Hollywood liked it so much that it basically remade it as ""To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar,"" with bigger names and a sanitized plot.Marketing for ""Priscilla"" makes it seem like a gay romp (sorry, I couldn't resist), but it's not. It's actually a very serious and quite depressing film. These are not drag queens full of bravado and content to be who they are. These are men struggling with serious issues and to some extent using their female personas to hide. Yes, there are some disco numbers and lots of dazzling costumes, and yes, ""I Will Survive"" does make its appearance, but anyone coming to the movie thinking it's going to be a riot are sure to be disappointed.It boasts three great performances from Hugo Weaving, Terence Stamp and Guy Pearce, who particularly proves to the world how hot a woman he can be.Grade: B+",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Mediocre film with something special,"I can't be objective with this, as it's been my official ""feel good"" film for decades. The direction and pacing are a bit off, the jokes are not even that funny, but somehow I still end up watching it regularly. There is just something charming about these characters and the way they use humor to deflect discrimination and hard times in life that makes you love them instantly. Bernadette is my childhood hero, his character is pure genius and I loved Terence Stamp's grouchy lip-sync and stiff dance routines. Guy Pearce really got into the role, but the most convincing as an old-school drag queen was hands down Hugo Weaving.Three decades later, the public perception of drag queens changed drastically, and this film certainly lost its edge over time, but it's still moderately fun and extremely heartwarming. After Drag Race became popular there is an invasion of glamorous, second-rate haute-couture drag queens, but I still prefer the ridiculously showy, masculine feel of the scene portrayed here.

Overrated PC rubbish,"I saw this in the cinema during its initial release and can only ask ""has the world gone mad?"" The seemingly overwhelming positive response is mind boggling for this poorly written, embarrasingly predictable clap trap.Stephan Elliot is no genius film maker as evidenced by the consistent bombs he has produced since (check out 'Welcome to Woop Woop', 'Eye of the Beholder')I can only assume making a film dealing with the gay/transexual culture has people assuming that to dislike the film is an offense to this sector of the populace. Aren't we smarter than that? What about an interesting script and good performances? Ok so the 3 leads do alright considering what they have to work with, but this film includes the worst performance by a child actor I have ever seen, not helped by appalling dialogue and a really lame resolution that you can see a mile off.This is a disappointing film and one that doesn't deserve the overblown reputation it has garnered.",1.0,Anonymous,Music

Hey Lady..,"Rented this the other day, and I am STILL amazed at how this good of a movie this is. 11 years ago (was it really that long ago? My, how time flies), I caught a sneak preview of this film with like 200 other gay men (the screening was put on by a gay newspaper) and we were all STUNNED at the originality on display here. Watching it again in 2005, it still holds up extremely well. Queens will be queens I suppose. This was all done of course when Hugo Weaving and Guy Pearce were relative unknowns, and no one could give a whoop what Terrance Stamp was doing. Upon the initial viewing, I had no doubt that the two lead queens were gay. No doubt. None. Of course, what's so amazing about it NOW is that of course they're NOT. I think I was annoyed about this fact when I found out, but now, it's just so amazing how everyone, especially Hugo Weaving, just GOT it dead on on their portrayals. I haven't even talked about the story, which I'll let you discover for yourself. But the script is wonderfully bitchy, acerbic and downright hilarious. Not too sure why this didn't get nominated for a screenplay award at the Academies when Lizzy Gardiner won her well deserved award for the costuming in the film.

However the trick of this movie is that the guys don't play it too broadly. Stamp and Weaving are actually playing it reserved. They are more wore-down middle age men than flamboyant gays.

"Amiable, but ultimately undernourished comedy-drama","Shaggy, friendly yet frustrating film has the same old message: if you want to make it in this world, being imaginative isn't enough, you have to live up to your place in society and that means living by the (heterosexual) rules that govern us. Drag queen comedy-drama from Australia is a mostly upbeat journey of three male friends traveling across the Outback in their pink bus, christened Priscilla. While not a formula film per se, there are the obligatory ""road movie"" sequences (bonding by the bonfire, facing down the rednecks, etc.). Writer-director Stephan Elliott follows every potentially mean-spirited moment with a little humor and sympathy, but there are puzzling gaps in his narrative, a dire subplot about a gay man's relationship with his ex-wife and estranged pre-teen son (both of whom are comfortable--and the child wise--with his lifestyle), and a third act with no energy whatsoever. It has some wicked transvestite humor and a fairly game cast, but a script that seems to have been watered down along the way. ** from ***",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Beautifully Bizarre Travelogue,"Three gay male performers journey from Sydney to Alice Springs in a colorful bus. I found the story to be contrived and not very interesting, though never let it be said that the three main characters lacked personality. The film's dialogue seemed flat and unimaginative.But what the film lacked in screen story, it made up for, as a travelogue. What a grand music video. The Australian outback, in its lonesome desolation, with its resident lizards and ants, was magnificent. Amplifying these images was the film's harshly haunting score. The result was a wonderful tribute to the visuals of Sergio Leone, and the music of Ennio Morricone, in their spaghetti westerns. Then, into these emotionally evocative scenes, add a transvestite walking alone to nowhere, or applying lipstick, and you have what amounts to true cinematic art. Just terrific.I also liked the images of the sleek, shiny fabric streaming back from the top of the bus as it flees across desert badlands, while Felicia sings, with gusto, some operatic aria. And then there is the image of the pink kite flying high, with ethereal music playing in the background. Given the offbeat nature of the story, somewhere, concealed in all these stark images and intense sounds, is a profound symbolism.Most of the scenes in this film are tedious and uninteresting. But those scenes that do stand out are memorable and hugely successful. I don't recall a film in which the cinematography and the music of selected scenes so overwhelmed the overall story. "" ... Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert"" is certainly evidence that a film can, and should, be more than a mere script.",,Anonymous,Music
More than I expected,"I was pleasantly surprised by Priscilla, Queen of the Desert when I watched it for the first time yesterday. Having expected something very light and almost fluffy, I liked the fact that there was a little more depth to it than that.The beginning of the film suggests the humour that comes later in the film, but it doesn't stop the first five minutes or so from having quite a sad and solemn feel. What I particularly like about this film are the fantastically well-crafted lines - they can be intentionally very funny, but at the same time there are just as many funny lines that aren't specifically meant to constitute punchlines - they're just there and they're funny.An aspect of the film that I especially liked was the use of colour. As an art student, I have always found that colour appeals to me and I love the visual impact that the colours - the pinks, the lilacs, the jades, even the zebra prints - make on the screen, perhaps more so than the fabrics the costumes were made from. Who said over-the-top automatically equalled tasteless? These costumes are over-the-top, but the film is all the better for it.Little details within films also appeal to me - the blink-and-you'll-miss-it Barbie doll mobile hanging up in the tour bus, for instance, or the reactions of the local people they walk past in the streets - as much as the larger details. I think the landscape shots are brilliant, and the scene where the three find themselves lost and stranded in the middle of nowhere and the camera pans out to demonstrate this is just fantastic.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"priscilla, queen of the desert","Like most road movies it's better when it's on the road. The scenes in the outback are both visually and verbally impressive, featuring some of the most awesome desert/mountain cinematography since Winton Hoch took on Monument Valley for John Ford as well as some of the cleverest bitchy banter this side of Dorothy Parker. Bravo cinematographer Brian Breheny and writer/director Stephan Elliot!Once we reach our destination, a casino oasis in more ways than one in the wasteland, the film starts to slow down and lose both its visual and comic edges as the more serious but slightly duller issues of Mitzi's being a good dad and Bernadette's being a good wife start to encroach upon the brilliant comic rivalry between the three drag queens who are constantly and hilariously on each other's last nerves and the wacko marriage of Bob, an outback garage mechanic, and a lusty, slightly insane stripper.The performances from the four principals are all great. However, the movie reaches the full crescendo of its hilarity, in my opinion, in the interplay between Terence Stamp's world weary, easily irritated Bernadette and Guy Pearce's cheeky, monumentally annoying Felicia. When these two go at each other it's impossible to keep a straight face.Bottom line: Until we hit Alice Springs it's a great ride. Give it a B plus.PS...A couple annoying PC matters to dispense with. I could have done without the Indigenous Australian equals good/Caucasian Aussie equals less good equation as well as Bernadette's kneeing the most transphobic character in the balls, a scene we've seen countless times before.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Priscilla Does Her Best,"This film really took the world by storm when it was originally released. I'm happy about that as is confirmed in many of the reviews here, this subject matter makes a lot of people uncomfortable and/or is very foreign to them. I think this is in part why it was so successful, people thought they knew these type of characters and the film dispelled a lot of negative stereotypes and really humanized them and actually made them relatable. Yes, the film looks good, the costumes are great, and the soundtrack is fun, yet also a bit pandering, and cliched. Unfortunately, the story doesn't move much beyond the cliches and we're left with a film that has lots of great elements, solid performances, and does provide a few fun and interesting moments, but are left with disappointment at how much better it could have been. Still, Priscilla is worth checking out.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Epically Queer and Dazzling 30 Years Later,"In 1994, one of the most important LGBTQ films from the land down under was released entitled The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. Written and directed by Stephan Elliot, the film was a massive success both in its home country of Australia and all across the globe, as it brought mainstream international attention to the LGBTQ community thanks to its positive portrayal of drag queens and queer individuals. Given that its success spawned a 2006 stage musical and a large cult following, it's time to see just how well it holds up after three decades in the queer cultural landscape.The movie follows three drag queens as they journey across the Australian Outback from Sydney to Alice Springs in their tour bus named ""Priscilla"", along the way encountering various groups and individuals. As Priscilla is a road movie from near start to finish, its tone is quite comedic and risque in nature but also shockingly tender and emotional when it needs to be. The lead character Anthony ""Tick"" Belrose, a.k.a. Mitzi Del Bra, is primarily attending Alice Springs via request from his estranged wife Marion, which is difficult considering that he has to admit his profession to his own family. As earth shattering as that is for him, the accompaniment of the trans woman Bernadette Bassenger and the lively yet childish Adam Whitely (Felicia Jollygoodfellow) make the journey thoroughly engaging with their personalities contrasting well off one another. Hugo Weaving and Guy Pearce make for strong leading men and you feel for every single situation they end up in, whether it be a perilous life threatening sequence or a fun musical number, and they're just part of the fun.Outside of Weaving and Pearce, Terence Stamp nearly steals the show as Bernadette, making the character more reserved and nuanced in nature yet rightfully the more experienced member of the trio from living a longer life and witnessing more prejudice in spite of being content with who she is. As fun and campy as the film can be in tone, it knows when to let its more dramatic and tender moments let loose thanks in large to Bernadette, especially when she grows closer to the men and Bob Spart, the only man willing to help out our heroes in spite of his own troubles. As for Marion, while she is content with her husband's life and group albeit in lieu of her own entertainment profession, a much bigger hurdle is faced in their relationship, and without giving too much away, let's just say that is where the film's real heart lies within. Many of the other characters are mere obstacles in the trio's way, including many homophobic gangs and Bob's problematic showgirl wife. Even with a fairly small cast, the actors make the most out of their roles and make them more memorable as a result.As far as the presentation goes, the film actually won an Oscar for best costume design and it definitely deserved it. On top of a large variety of materials making up so many different suits that our trio display throughout the film, the cast fit in them so smoothly that their attire is practically to die for. The wardrobe is made even more fabulous by the elaborate choreography and lip synching to to the film's killer soundtrack, consisting of numerous camp classics like ""I've Never Been to Me"" by Charlene, ""I Will Survive"" by Gloria Gaynor, ""Finally"" by CeCe Peniston, and of course ""Mamma Mia"" by ABBA. Although some numbers might stop the film dead in its tracks here and there, they're so much fun to marvel at that you hardly even notice, and they're always a blast to listen to on their own. The original music by Guy Gross also fits the film appropriately amongst the long illustrious outback captured gorgeously onscreen. These notable production qualities are just the little things that make a film like Priscilla, Queen of the Desert a pure visual delight in addition to being a wholesome experience.To say that Priscilla, Queen of the Desert is a landmark in queer cinema, let alone Australian cinema, would be an incredible understatement. Not only is the film packed with comedic show stopping splendor, but its wholesome story and outstanding performances have allowed it to age like the finest wine there is. Whether or not you yourself identify as queer in any way shape or form, this film is a must watch for anyone curious about the finest movie going experiences down under. It's amazing how much cultural significance this film rightfully garnered over the last three decades; it truly is a one of a kind road flick.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Tack-a-rama!,"I embarked on a journey through the beautiful outback of Australia with three guys who are searching for an answer. They are three drag queens. The best in Sydney, who want to spend the next four weeks traveling to this casino to perform their performance of a life time. There is Adam Whitely, also known as Felicia Jollygoodfellow (Guy Pearce). He is the ""classic"" drag queen. Constantly looking for a good time. Very comfortable in his lifestyle, and always looking for a chance to be in the spotlight. Pearce adds most of the comedy to the trip and perhaps some of the best costumes that these ""ladies"" have to wear. There is also Anthony ""Tick"" Belrose (Hugo Weaving), also known as Mitzi Del Bra. He is the secretive drag queen. We learn that he is married, he has a child, and that he is afraid of his profession. Quite possibly the best performer in the group, he provides a sense of leadership to the group. He is the one that organized this trip, and the one who's wife works at the casino, and set up this gig for them. Finally, there is the elder of the group. The experienced drag queen, Ralph, also known as Bernadette Bassenger. He is almost like the Yoda of the group. Shouting out lessons that need to be learned, he plays the complete opposite to Pearce's character. After buying a bus it to travel through the outback, they christen it ""Priscilla"". After a few road bumps such as stops in other locations, a Chinese ping-pong lady, a group of violent mates, and even love. As they make it to the casino, our group hits their final snag as they struggle for acceptance in an unchanged world.This was a horrible film. Not just horrible, but also confusing, plot less, motionless, and uneventful. Yes, I realize many of those words mean the same, but they all happened in this film. My first problem was that I had trouble trying to see who the ""stand-out"" character was. Normally in films, you have that one character that has more screen time, more sub-stories, more character development. While I first thought that it was going to be Weaving's character, during the bus trip through the outback, I began to question my initial guess. I feel that if we wanted to have the emotional impact at the end of the film for Weaving's reuniting with his son, then perhaps we should have spend less time with Stamp as we traveled. I felt that midway through the film, Stamp became the central character because of his love towards Bob. If this is the case, was the director trying to create the theme of acceptance towards same sex characters, or was he trying to show the theme of acceptance of who you are and not to be afraid to be proud. I felt that these themes broke down like ""Priscilla"" in the outback.Not only were the themes jumbled, but so were these characters. I realize that Stamp was nominated for some awards for this role, but I honestly felt like he, along with the rest of the cast, were just walking through some lines and blocking. During their songs, I felt that they were acting. I never once felt a connection to these characters. Colorful costumes do not make a better actor. Terence Stamp hardly smiled in what I felt was supposed to be a fun character. I need to also say this, if you are going to make a film about lip singing to songs, make sure that your actors know the lyrics. About ten times I saw them, especially Stamp, flub his lines.Finally, there was not enough development at all with Pearce's character. I felt that if anything he was just annoying. Not really contributing anything to the actual story other then the occasional joke or reference, he seemed to just float through every scene on just his physical appearance. Did he need to have his shirt off for every scene?Overall, the costumes were great...but don't make this the focus of your film. I enjoyed the beauty of the costumes in the desert...seemed to strike me as religious in some way. Dull, trite, and what seemed like bored actors brought this film directly to my DVD then right out the window. Films have moved so much further in this genre of film that I hope that we learn from its mistakes.Grade: ** out of *****",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Epic LGBTQ+ Film,"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"" is not merely a film; it's a vibrant, shimmering cultural artifact, a testament to the power of self-expression and the enduring allure of the open road. From my initial viewing years ago, to the countless times I've revisited its sun-drenched landscapes and sequined extravagance, and even as recently as yesterday's re-watch, the film's magic remains undiminished. It's a testament to its timeless quality, a quality that transcends trends and speaks to the universal human desire for acceptance and joy.What makes ""Priscilla"" so enduring? It's a confluence of factors, starting with its audacious premise: three drag queens, Tick/Mitzi, Adam/Felicia, and Bernadette, embarking on a cross-country journey through the Australian outback in a flamboyant tour bus named Priscilla.This journey isn't just a physical trek; it's a voyage of self-discovery, a confrontation with societal prejudices, and a celebration of chosen family.The film's visual spectacle is undeniable. The costumes, designed by Tim Chappel and Lizzy Gardiner, are a riot of color and texture, a dazzling display of creativity and resourcefulness. From towering headdresses to shimmering gowns, each outfit is a character in itself, reflecting the personalities and aspirations of the queens. The outback landscapes, vast and awe-inspiring, provide a stark yet beautiful backdrop to the queens' flamboyant performances. The contrast between the arid, rugged terrain and the queens' opulent attire creates a visual feast that is both striking and memorable.Beyond the spectacle, ""Priscilla"" delves into deeper themes of identity, acceptance, and the power of friendship. Bernadette, the elder stateswoman of the group, played with grace and gravitas by Terence Stamp, provides a sense of wisdom and resilience. Adam/Felicia, the brash and impulsive one, portrayed with infectious energy by Guy Pearce, embodies youthful rebellion and a thirst for adventure. Tick/Mitzi, the more introspective of the trio, played with vulnerability and depth by Hugo Weaving, grapples with the complexities of fatherhood and his own identity.The film's humor is both broad and subtle, ranging from slapstick moments to witty one-liners. It's a humor that celebrates the queens' flamboyant personalities while also acknowledging the challenges they face. The film doesn't shy away from depicting the prejudice and hostility they encounter, but it does so with a sense of defiance and resilience. The queens' unwavering spirit and their ability to find joy in the face of adversity are ultimately what make ""Priscilla"" so uplifting.""Priscilla"" is more than just a comedy; it's a celebration of diversity and a powerful statement about the importance of embracing one's true self. It's a film that challenges societal norms and encourages viewers to question their own preconceived notions. It's a reminder that beauty and strength can be found in the most unexpected places.The soundtrack, a compilation of disco hits and pop anthems, perfectly complements the film's vibrant energy. Songs like ""I Will Survive,"" ""Finally,"" and ""Venus"" become anthems of empowerment, reflecting the queens' determination to overcome obstacles and live their lives on their own terms.The music is an integral part of the film's emotional impact, amplifying the joy, the sorrow, and the sheer exuberance of the queens' journey.For anyone who's ever felt like an outsider,""Priscilla"" offers a sense of belonging. For anyone who's ever dared to dream big, it offers a sense of inspiration. And for anyone who simply wants to laugh and be entertained, it offers a truly unforgettable cinematic experience. It's a film that resonates on multiple levels, offering both lighthearted entertainment and profound insights into the human condition. It is a film that deserves to be watched, re-watched, and celebrated for its enduring brilliance.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Highlighted by fantastic performances and stunning costumes.,"If you're thinking Priscilla is a lady, you're mistaken. If you're thinking its a drag queen, you're also mistaken. Priscilla is actually the name of the bus three gay guys travel in.The story revolves around three drag queens, Tick (Hugo Weaving), Adam (Guy Pearce) and Bernadette (Terence Stamp) who go on a cross-country journey in a bus to do a drag show at a Hotel Casino Resort. At first glance these three might look like three ordinary drag queens, but as the film develops and we learn more about each character, we discover each of them are fighting their inner demons and there's more to them than meets the eye.We see two very different sides of each character throughout the film. There's the flamboyant, blissful and boisterous side, and then there's also a much deeper side to them. The actors portrayed these very different personae to perfection. Terence Stamp in particular was excellent.There's plenty of laughs and adventure along the way, and a bit of drama as well. The cinematography is absolutely beautiful and the costumes and make-up are simply stunning! The film also has a great soundtrack.When it comes to gay-themed movies, there really is only a handful I view as masterful, and 'Priscilla, Queen of the Desert' is one such a movie. This was sensational.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Sparkling cuvÃ©e, attempting to imitate champagne","many superlatives have been thrown at this film, many sycophantic accolades. In my opinion, it is an attempt to cut through, a bold, and even adventurous exercise in film story telling. the sad reality is that it is a failure in honest theatrical terms.Like a sparkling cuvÃ©e, it is imbued with effervescent enthusiasm, but its pedigree lacks the finesse of the champagne it attempts to imitate, and, not surprisingly, it conveys very little taste.The direction is stilted and obvious, even clunky at times; the acting, with one, and occasionally two notable exceptions, rates from bold to over the top, and the dialogue suffers from poor scripting and unrefined delivery. Like many (alas too many) Australian films, it is a work based upon a script devoid of a good story, which is competently shot (although in this case containing some technical errors of judgement) but rather over enthusiastically played out. PQD is like the outpourings of an amateur theatre troupe, hell bent upon having fun, strutting their individual stuff, and playing for laughs.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Great road trip,"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert is a great road trip movie that constantly zigs when you'd expect it to zag, enhanced by a collection of characters who are a joy to spend time with. It always remains a fun film rife with warmth whilst still being able to acknowledge the darker sides of human intolerance. Every stop on their journey brings joy or tension, culminating in a satisfying use of an Abba song that's set up early on.Hugo Weaving, Guy Pearce and Terence Stamp are all phenomenal. Their performances are varying degrees of extroverted with Pearce being the most, but they do it in a very impressive fashion so it never comes across as a pastiche. They communicate so much without having to say a lot thanks to their impeccable body language and there are still plenty of moments of earnest emotion when they do open up.Stephan Elliott's direction nails the road movie aspects as the film moves gracefully from one destination to the next without ever rushing or dragging and the tone generally never falters. Brian J. Breheny's cinematography accomplishes big things in a subtle way, capturing beautiful vistas of the Australian outback made even more striking by the titular brightly coloured bus and the flamboyant outfits traversing them.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Marvellous!,"This is one of the most wonderful films ever made.  Never mind the gaudy, unselfconsciousness or flamboyance.  Its ultimately a film about acceptance, extremely positive, and almost everybody I know who has seen it loved it.My personal favourite moment is when Tick is playing the butch man for the benefit of his son, and realises not only that his son knows that he is a gay man and a drag performer, but that he totally accepts this as normal. Its a hugely poigniant moment.  Its probably hard to understand if you've never had something about yourself that could be tough for others to accept. The transgendered person.  The widow.  The gay man trying to solicialise with thugs in a tough town.  The gay father.  That gay man whose been married with children.  All of the characters are looking for acceptance and the reassurance for each of them is reassuring to the audience, and it speaks in particular to gay and t/g audiences.I thought this film had a lot in common with the more bittersweet ""Torch Song Trilogy"", but with a more positive ending.  Firstein's early film ends on an ambiguous note, almost back where he started, with the unpredictable bisexual boyfriend and uncertain future.The whole mail-order bride thread was utterly hilarious, her desperation for attention and hyperactivity a real hoot.Also the soundtrack - very camp, slightly retero.  Funny thing about this film is how it hasn't really dated.",,Anonymous,Music
whats not to love...,"I ordered this movie soon after seeing it on TV and how glad I am I did so. I did not make the connection with 'superman', 'matrix' or even 'the time machine', being the actors other movies they have been in, but knowing so makes this even more special knowing how well they gave of themselves to make this believable. You can really feel yourself there going through their experiences. It's more than just a movie of two dragqueens and a transsexual, as it conveys 'three lives' intertwined through comedy, raw life and just pure love and respect for one another. The acting, plot,costumes, score and overall charm of this movie can't be overstated, and I just want to say for the record :Thanks to the entire cast for brightening my world.I went into the movie feeling myself just part of another day. Three friends take 'who' they really are on the road for the world to see and enjoy, and become better for the sharing. I came out of the movie somewhat sad because of the good memories it stirred up of days in the bars with people I knew then, but also with a renewed zest, reminding me that part of who I am is still here and doesn't want to be forgotten.In the end we are to take from this movie the age old philosophy of be yourself and be happy, amongst good friends and good times.I wholeheartedly accept and so should you ;-)",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert","The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert as well as Strictly Ballroom very much gave Australian cinema a shot in the arm regarding camp and kitsch.If the new wave emerged in the 1970s with serious Oz cinema. Now it was letting its hair down in the 90s.Priscilla is basically three drag queens on a road trip to the outback. Mitzi/Tick (Hugo Weaving) needs to visit his young son that he had from a brief encounter. Joining him are his fellow performers.Bernadette/Ralph (Terence Stamp) who is getting over the death of his partner. Felicia/Adam (Guy Pearce) who is young, carefree and reckless.While they get some semblance of acceptance in the big city. The outback is another matter. After their bus Priscilla breaks down, they put on shows in small bars with garish costumes and lip sync to camp disco classics.Bernadette finds tenderness from Bob (Bill Hunter.) A mechanic with a Thai wife who likes to play with ping pong balls when she gets drunk.It is a thin story but with lots of heart and stereotypes. There are viscous put downs as the performers face homophobia.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A f a n t a s t i c movie,"This film was so amazing i would be surprised if i have watched it any less than 15 times! The actors were so great - they were so brave to take on such a different role and their performances were so amazing - i have to pinch myself from time to time. 'Being a man one day and a woman the next is not an easy thing to do.' The constant out there jokes (cue Abba turd) get me every time - so do the scenes between Mitzi and Benj - and Bernadette and Bob. I think it's amazing that a movie with such a different storyline and odd jokes could have a soft, sweet side.I recently went to see 'Pricilla Queen of the Desert - The Musical' and i was absolutely blown away - the costumes and the music were so great - i which i could see it again - but the movie was just a bit better, in my opinion - and thats only because the actors in the movie seemed so real - and had real feelings and emotions.The choice of music was great - and kept the lively vibe from the movie going to the very last 'Mamma Mia' scene. The songs are constantly in my head!! The scene after the credits about the kite was very funny and kept me laughing even when the movie was finished.The director, Stephen Elliot, was fantastic. Not only did he write an amazing, open-minded, out there script - but he managed to deliver an even better movie. Nobody acknowledged that the drag scene existed in Australia - and lots of the Aussie population thought that these men were wacky and were making absolute fools of themselves. Stephen Elliot showed the drag queens, transsexuals and gay population in all their glory - kudos.All in all - this is my favourite movie and a classic film and has changed the way that people think forever.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert","Drag queen ""Tick"" (Hugo Weaving) gets the offer of a gig in Alice Springs and suggests to fellow artiste ""Bernadette"" (Terence Stamp) that they both go. How to get there? Well that's where their headstrong young pal ""Felicia"" (Guy Pearce) comes in. He has no compunction in using a bit of emotional blackmail to extort cash from his mother. Next thing, the three have an old (soon to be pink) bus and are winging their way from Sydney at the start of their 1700 mile trip north. Like any trip in a confined space, tempers flare and these three, already near the top of the histrionics chart, provide us with some entertainingly profane language that make you smile and wince at the same time. As they travel, they tentatively explore more of each other's foibles and personalities as well as a terrain which isn't always the most hospitable. En route, they encounter ""Bob"" (Bill Hunter) who might just offer an hint of romance for the trans ""Bernadette"" who is suffering from a bit of ennui with life in general. Their eventual arrival tops a journey of discovery for all of them, but especially ""Tick"" who's in for quite a surprise! A great soundtrack and some earthy and witty writing help out enormously here, but it's essentially the three men whose ridiculously exaggerated characterisations and temper tantrums of an existence that make this a journey you'd love to watch but are very glad you're not actually on. There were a few popular films made that challenged the global stereotype of Australian machismo and bull-headedness but by taking this into the outback, this offers everyone a chance to contrast the open-mindedness of some with the opposite in others - all whilst keeping sight of the fact that this is a comedy, and a satirical and delightfully sarcastic one at that.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Weird, disturbing, poor acts, great costumes.","I like all of the main actors involved in this quite bizarre film. Terrance Stamp, Guy Pearce & Hugo Weaving have all proved themselves as some of the best & most capable actors around, but I could not get into this. I don't know if it's because I don't understand the lifestyle or what, but I could not get my head around this film. Worse than anything is that the actors made some of the ugliest drag queens I've ever seen. I think that was part of the point, I don't know. I realize that is probably an insult, but I don't know what else to call them. I must say I bought the guys as the performers (the correct term?) but the story just wasn't very good or very interesting either. I will say that I can't usually appreciate costume designers very well, although I notice them when they are wrong or out of place, but I was very much impressed with these. Very creative to say the least, just not attractive, but I don't think they're supposed to be. I don't know I am definitely not the target audience and would never go see a performance done by these kind of performers, but I wouldn't go see ballet, or opera either so I don't know. If this is your kind of film then you will probably like it, but if it's not skip it because it is...well not for most of us. I just checked it won the Oscar for costume design & I will say rightfully so. I must say Ebert didn't care much for this film either, though he liked it better than I did.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

The crazy adventures of two drag queens and a transsexual as the traverse Australia in a converted bus is hilarious. The music is nearly all ABBA and the costumes are simply over the top and deserving of the Oscar that they won - and who remembers the costume designer in her American Express Gold Card dress? This is a touching movie about self acceptance and true love despite all the odds. And all three of the main characters are straight but completely believable as gay men. The scene that contains the ping pong balls is, alone, worth the price of a rental but the film in its entirety is a fun-filled road show with a new twist.",,Anonymous,Music

A terrific movie that didn't get it's due,"This movie is such an underrated classic. It's initial release was overshadowed by ""TO Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar"", because most of the general public couldn't wait to run out and see Swayze, Snipes and Leguizamo in a dress. But the real warmth comes from this little Australian Film. I worked in the ""Drag Queen"" Industry (although not as a drag queen - I was the genetic female cocktail waitress) and the general consensus was that this was a much more accurate portrayal of the life of a Drag Queen. Humorous beyond measure, yet poignant enough to give a glimpse into some of the problems and obstacles (Bernadette and Tick's conversation at dinner, Felicia's drugged out beating, the bus) facing alternative lifestyles.

The subject matter has been dealt with very simply -- no philosophizing, no apologies, no going into traumatic childhood kind of thing (although there was a scene where there was a flashback of Adam and his stepfather in the bathroom -- but that was more hilarious than traumatic).I loved the costumes, the treatment of the Wo-Man makeup products and got a real kick watching Hugo Weaving throwing handbags as an improvised game. The most memorable scene was the one where a real Asian girl go-go dancer and unhappy wife of a mechanic took the stage in her zebra print lingerie outfit complete with hat and white hosiery plus ping-pong balls. She did this amazing trick with the ping-pong balls that left our three drag queens shocked beyond words.Truly amazing!!",8.0,Anonymous,Music

"A ""gay friendly"" film with some qualities, but which seems unfinished in some important aspects.","This has been one of the most beloved films among the transsexual community, even though it seems obvious to me that being a transvestite and transsexual are not identical things. A transvestite is anyone who wears clothing belonging to the opposite sex to look like that. A transsexual is anyone who believes that they should have been born with the opposite sex to the one they have, and who, not infrequently, begins to undergo medical treatments in order to achieve the physical appearance they desire. What do they have in common? Both are minorities of little expression within the ""gay"" movement and, despite being visible, they have demands that sometimes contradict those of the homosexual movement, leading to some internal friction.None of this really matters, but it helps to understand why the group keeps this film on their favorites list. Filmed in Australia, it shows us the bumpy journey of a troupe of transvestites through the Australian desert to a remote town, where they are supposed to have some shows. The film has an intelligent script, where the adventures and misadventures of the trio intersect with other caricatured characters and, of course, with the intolerance and homophobia of isolated rural communities, where the ""gay friendly"" film takes the opportunity to make certain criticisms of these attitudes. Unfortunately, the film doesn't give us more than this, the characters are poorly developed and the feeling that remains is that of a project made to please a niche audience and not to tell a good story.The cast has three strong names at the front who ensure consistent protagonism: Terence Stamp, Hugo Weaving and Guy Pearce. The three actors are solid bets and do a very decent job with the material received, with Pearce, more extravagant and bizarre, being the one who least satisfies me. The character he offered us is a caricature and not a credible human figure. He is the one who purchases the tourist bus that will be used on the trip, and which he bizarrely names Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.On a technical level, the film does not present great quality scores, for which it deserves special praise. With a couple of exceptions: the first is the design of the costumes worn in the film by the trio of main actors, full of bizarre details that allude to the world of the show; The second is the cinematography, very well conceived and crafted, and to which the exquisite choice of desert filming locations and, also, the good filming and lighting work largely contributed.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
smashing,"I cannot understand how someone who sees this film cannot be taken by how wonderful it is. True, it is not deep, it is not groundbreaking, and the plot is not the strongest asset. But the acting is wonderful, the characters are believable, and there are subtleties that cannot be noticed watching it the first time. I have seen this movie maybe twenty times, and every time, I see something new, something funny.Guy Pearce of L.A. Confidential makes an astounding change of pace as a very effeminate drag queen, and So does Hugo Weaving from his straight role in Proof. I cannot even look at Terence Stamp anymore without admiring how he could morph so gracefully into a ""woman.""Overall, I sing praises for this movie.

A funny movie that makes you think,"This movie is great! It addresses the issues of homosexuality, transvestitism, and gender changes with a funny, optimistic attitude. The acting by Weaving, Stamp, and Pierce is great and humorous, and the costumes (which won a 1994 Oscar) are amazing. The movie is not limited to the happy-go-lucky side of the three companions' lives as performers, but also has its fair share of exposing the discrimination experienced by drag queens and trans genders. The soundtrack is mainly disco and dance music, so this may be irritating to those who aren't big on ABBA!

"Wonderful, hilarious, campy fun","Wonderful, hilarious, campy fun.Two drag queens, Felicia (played by Guy Pearce) and Mitzi (Hugo Weaving), and a transsexual, Bernadette (Terrence Stamp), leave Sydney for Alice Springs in order to play a series of shows. Their mode of transport - a bus, Priscilla. Their appearance in rural towns gets mixed reactions...Very funny movie. Dialogue is razor-sharp and wittily clever. The characters themselves provide much of the entertainment, especially the over-the-topness of Felicia.Some interesting themes too, especially of tolerance and intolerance, and not prejudging people. Much of our characters' help and support comes from unexpected sources...Great work by the three leads. Guy Pearce is great as the larger- than-life, bitchy Felicia. Terrence Stamp provides the gravitas as Bernadette. Mitzi is the most complex character and Hugo Weaving does a great job in the role.Good support from Bill Hunter as Bob.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

An Adventure in the Cycles of Life,"Beyond the campiness of the ABBA tunes, the outrageous costumes, and the superficial drag queen/transsexual jokes is the story of three different stages of life as we encounter them.We meet Tick/Mitzi, Adam/Felicia, and Bernadette (don't call her Ralph) heading out to the Outback in Australia for a gig.  Our heroines have their run of the mill ""adventures"" on their trip but what elevates this film is the exploration of the needs of each of them.Felicia is in his mid 20s and all he wants to do is have fun and danger. He doesnt have a problem in the world and he doesnt care to have them.  His youth is not going to be wasted.Mitzi, in his mid 30s is starting to think about being a bit more responsible.  We discover that the manager at the hotel where they're due to perform is actually his ex-wife and if that weren't enough, his son is waiting for him as well.  Mitzi, like most people in their 30s with children wonders if he'll be a good father.Bernadette is in her mid 50s.  She's gone past the first two ages.  Her only concern now is someone to spend the rest of her days with.  Luckily, she finds Bob.In this subtle way, we're pulled in to identify with and feel for these people.The acting was superb.  Although Terence Stamp got most of the accolades, Hugo Weaving and Guy Pearce were brilliant as well.  Despite your opinions on ABBA, you'll probably enjoy the soundtracks as well.  Definately required viewing.",,Anonymous,Music
The best film ever made,"I saw Priscilla when it first came out, and, seeing as I'm only 17 now, I wasn't that old then. Thing is, despite my short stature and inability to be able to understand half the jokes (I'm sure!) I was mesmerised, and have never looked back. From the first time I saw it, Priscilla has been my favourite film of all time. I bought it on video as soon as it came out, and have seen it around 200 times (I'm not kidding or exaggerating) yet still I love it more than ever.I love its mixture of camp humour and serious messages about the morals and mixed messages in our society. I love Bob. He rules! If only other men cared so little about anything but who you are on the inside.I also love Adam, and the story about uncle Barry in the bath! hehehe. And I love the way he gets at Bernadette by calling her Ralph. The only thing I can say which annoys me in this film is the appauling acting by Mitsy's wife and son, who seem to think they are the new family in 'Neighbours' and the wife in particular opens her mouth so wide every time she speaks, I think she's going to eat me! But other than that, which is such a small proportion of the film, and does not distract in any way from its simple camp charm, this is an absolutely AMAZING film! I will continue watching it til the day I die! Peace out. Laura-Leigh (Smileypies)",10.0,Anonymous,Music
You don't have to understand drag to love this movie,"This movie is about friendship and love and tolerance of your own people. We all have those friends that drive us crazy but for some reason we still love them. This movie shows us how far we will go for our friends and the people we care about. Including letting them go to live their lives their way. It makes you root for the characters in ways that wouldn't be expected. Well the costumes and the makeup and the behaviors are all over the top. But behind all of that are people, people looking for happiness and joy and companionship. The phrase I would cross the desert for you actually comes to life in this movie as they travel to the remote part of Australia. And like anyone being in close proximity of each other test their patience. But they always come back to each other and that's what this movie is about and that's why I love it.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"30 years later, still the Queen","No pun intended - I never watched the movie before now (well a few days ago). And I think I was wrong or had the wrong idea. I personally would never dress like that - it just is not something I am into. But that doesn't mean others shouldn't do it. And seeing how much fun people are having at events - why would you not want them to just do what makes them and others happy? I am not sure if we have moved enough from back then, but I do hope we will as humans evolve much further and accept any and everyone.The movie and its actors also walk a fine line. They cannot be too cliche - and they have to be able to make us feel what the characters go through. Really remarkable performances - they chose the right actors for that. I am sure they had a lot of people who know what it is to be in that world ... to always have to fear for your safety (movie does not shy away from that either) ... to have so many insecurities ... you do not have to think something is beautiful, you do not have to understand something either! Just let people express themselves - especially if they are not hurting anyone. And they surely are not.Great story, great performances and a beacon of hope overall .. for humanity.

Also, I must say that Terence Stamp looks gorgeous playing a trans woman, looking very Meryl Streep-esque.The Adventures of Priscilla features so many gorgeous Australian sunsets, but the sun never sets on the fun in this movie! It's replete with queer joy, with many drag performances to famous songs of the yesteryears, but it also portrays the struggles that trans individuals and drag queens face.The striking images of technicolor drag finery against the drab rocky landscapes of Australia display the courage and grit it takes for the trans and drag communities to be their authentic selves in a world that deems them as aberrations.The nostalgic OST features many songs that you'll know from bygone eras that will have you singing along and tapping your feet.There's much to love in this film and I'd definitely recommend watching it - especially if you're from the LGBTQ community.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

"Typically Australian melodramatic, conveniently black humorous yet pragmatically awareness raising","Typically Australian melodramatic, conveniently black humorous yet pragmatically awareness raising
To be honest I watched this show a few times before but it's probably the first time I finished the whole episode. After all on a Covid lockdown Saturday night what other better things do I have to do? And despite previous neutral to negative feeling towards this movie this time I actually find it a hit, a sensation and even a bit of touch not only because of the many hilarious scenes or vibrant music, but the awareness raised for people with non-binary sexual orientations, a group that has been long living in the shadow, a cohort that has long been loathed by the mainstream society and a subculture that has been buried in the everyday hype.Drag queens are not very attractive forms of people by many of our standards. Yet they exist just as any other human beings. Whilst being a taboo in various cultures, politics and religions as it is almost certain to open a can of worms such people are still ordinary people like you and me who deserve kindness and respect. This movies reveals many of the hatred and discrimination they experience especially in the outback. Passersby's refusal to help when their bus breaks downs, audience's indifference to their performance in the pub and near bashing by locals in the town reveal nothing but the disdain and resentment they suffer. It is also revealing that some of them, despite being homosexual, came from some form of heterosexual relationship before. It is 2021 and we all have been told to exercise tolerance and inclusiveness. While it is best to leave this matter to individuals' own interpretations, this movie at least reveals some of the little known facts that might become an eye opener to us.Apart from the topic itself there are many vibrantly colorful songs in the show which are an appeal to a musical fan like me. Many of them, like I Will survive , Go West and Finally Scene, have become classic or household songs.Cast and crew are another highlight. Hugo Weaving is an absolute talent with vast versatility in roles he acts, be it The Lord of the Rings trilogy, V for Vendetta (2005) or Dressmaker (2015). His British compatriot Guy Pearce makes a perfect acting partner due to this duo's flamboyant acting in the show. The outback backdrop in the heartland of Australia with red rocks and crystal clear sky clearly makes this show a draw card to many who haven't had the chance to visit this beautiful country.Just before I wrap up, can I please use the anecdotal timing for this show which was watched by me the day after my company held a Wear It Purple Day? What a coincidence.All in all I believe this movie proves to be a great show due to its artistic features as well as its revealing content. I'm sure no matter what perspective you look at it from there's gotta be something that amazes you.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Like a drag show, this film has an unnerving amount of confidence","Few films tackle the gay/lesbian genre with such flamboyant and outrageous tendencies, but The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert manages to be one of the genre's rarities. It's an uncommonly free-spirited film, bound by nothing and restrained by no one, with a writer/director who clearly understands and empathizes with the subculture and a cast committed to giving it the respect and the zany fun it deserves.We focus on Anthony Belrose (Hugo Weaving), who uses the drag pseudonym ""Mitzi Del Bra"" and works in Sydney as a performer for Lasseter's Hotel Casino Resort in the remote town of Alice Springs. Anthony, despite success at Lasseter's, hungers for something more out of his life and his performances; he's sick of being belittled to ""get naked"" or show skin when he's pouring his heart out on stage before the microphone. As a result, he rounds up his colleagues Bernadette Bassinger (Terrence Stamp), a transsexual performer and Adam Whitely (Guy Pearce), a younger, more obnoxious soul who goes under the stage name ""Felicia Jollygoodfellow"" to embark on a four-week tour through the Australian Outback in their large RV named ""Priscilla.""Classic road trip tropes ensue the second this eclectic trio embark on their journey. The three find a group of Aborigines, whom have never seen the art of drag performance, along with a group of rednecks that nearly have them lynched for intruding on their territory. Along the way, the gang gets equal parts feisty and sentimental with one another, getting on each others nerves at times and finding solace in one another for at least empathizing with their desire to be understood and respected for what they do.The Adventures of Priscilla, in order to really succeed as a film, needed to occasionally capture human emotions through a tender, sentimental lens and Elliot perfectly delivers it without the violins and the overblown emotional manipulation. He gives us a lot of time to spend confined with this trio on Priscilla before the emotions take over. He starts off lighter, peppering the film with bouts of wittiness (when the three harmonize the drinks they want in tune of ""Twelve Days of Christmas"") and light-hearted fun.The first leg of their trip about the goofy, somewhat hostile conversations they can have with one another. The second leg of the film is when most of the antics kick in and we see the trio's interactions with other minority subcultures, who choose to respond to the three in whatever way their own culture has perceived them (either openly or narrowly). Finally, the final leg of the film takes the aforementioned introspective look into these characters as human beings, with their own sense of idealism for themselves and the people around them. This is when The Adventures of Priscilla becomes a bit sadder, but never forgoes the element of good-natured, consistent fun.Aside from the conversational banter being a real hoot, Tim Chappel and Lizzy Gardiner's Oscar winning costume design is almost a character in itself. Chappel and Gardiner bathe the film in an exciting, eye-popping array of flamboyant color schemes and loud tones and hues that make for a visually delicious experience. Brian J. Breheny's cinematography also lends a hand to making the Australian Outback a lively character, accentuating every detail of the land in a way that makes the excursion that much more enjoyable. All the background devices in the film are precise, which makes The Adventures of Priscilla not only an interesting character study but a royal feast for the eyes.The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert also features some of the most compelling and uproariously funny work from Pearce, Stamp, and Weaving, three veteran character actors who continue to expand their horizons with the variety of roles they take. With all of this, there is a general showstopping quality to the film that stems from all its aesthetic attributes and central performances. Like a drag show, the film steps out with a bold, unflinching amount of confidence and persists to exploit every ounce of entertainment and humane element that it can handle and, in turn, delivers terrific entertainment for most of its runtime.Starring: Terrence Stamp, Hugo Weaving, Guy Pearce, and Bill Hunter.

Nice night for it.,"I have seen this movie maybe 20 times and never get sick of it. I laugh just as much now as I did when I first saw it at the cinema in 94.

Drag queens bopping their way through the Australian Outback,"For my buck, Priscilla Queen of the Desert was just going to be another gay movie.  There was a real trend in the mid nineties with films like The Birdcage, Too Wong Foo, Its my Party, and Love! Valor! Compassion! exploding onto the screen as America began to feel more at ease with its gay brothers and sisters.  And as we watched these movies, a whole `Gay Comic Genre' was really born.  Also we can't forget about the popularity of gay stand up at that same time.Priscilla did indeed avail itself of this trend, and every gay humor trick in the book.  It also managed to slip us some really amazing visual, comic and compassionate moments.  The relationship between Mitzi and his son is both intimidating and soulful.  As a gay man and a cross dressing performer, he was very unsure as to the receptivity of his son and really what sort of dad he could be.Mitzi (Hugo Weaving) and his two buddies (Guy Pearce and Terence Stamp) head for the deep outback to perform at a holiday spa doing their drag routines. They buy a bus for the trip (from three Swedes named Lars, Lars and Lars), and they christen it `Priscilla Queen of the Desert'.The trip to the outback is fraught with delays, mean hearted blokes, and desert creatures (not to mention some very musical Aborigine).  They shtick their way to the club, dancing to Abba, and dressing divinely all at the same time.  This is a very funny movie and you will not be disappointed.",,Anonymous,Music

Having to cope with an homophobic society, and yet finding love and understanding within it. It's the triumph of laughter over bitterness. With every possible reason to be bitter, they choose to laugh and conquer the hearts and minds of both the spectator and the desert people.

It's in the story; it's in the character--right where it should be. I found the film tender, sweet, real, hard-edged, tough. The ending is full of surprises--not just one but several, all sprung on the viewer within a short space of time, almost like an Agatha Christie novel, but with even more of the ""I should have known"" factor.

"'The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert' is filled with feathers, frocks and ""flippin' kangaroos"".","The worldwide cultural hit that helped introduce LGBT themes to mainstream audiences. Not only did it encompass drag queens, transgenders and homosexuality, but bravely tackled deeply moving subjects including homophobia and cultural segregation. It's easy to class this as a comedy road trip, and on the surface it is, yet surprisingly the humour disguises a powerful drama within. Two drag queens and a transgender woman journey across the Australian outback, meeting various individuals along the way, to perform their drag act in a remote casino resort. The energy that keeps this narrative flourishing is the chemistry of the cast. If the friendships are non-existent then the darker subjects pack no emotional resonance. Fortunately, both the literal characters and the performances were exceptional. These three fully independent sassy ""queens"" each have their own personality when in the disguise of drag. Felicia becomes extremely flirtatious, this juxtaposes Bernadette's more withdrawn persona which in turn results in Mitzi being viewed as tawdry. It's a testament to the power of drag, being able to portray someone else that opposes their conventional behaviour, and the film captures that both elegantly and comedically. Weaving (consistently underrated), Pearce and Stamp all give outstanding performances. The costumes were illuminatingly vibrant, the utilisation of resplendent colours against the backdrop of the dusty outback made for many memorable moments, particularly when Felicia sings atop of Priscilla (the name of the bus they travel in). Whilst the story addresses homophobia, it would've benefited from more tender moments considering how well developed the characters are. Also, I saw the camera crew in various reflections, just took me out of the film occasionally. Despite these criticisms, Priscilla remains hilariously flamboyant, boasting a stupendous screenplay by Elliott and fantastic central performances, cementing this as the pinnacle of LGBT films.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

He is awesome in this, totally different from the Time Machine and Memento.  And, Hugo Weaving is very good.  Some what scary in the costumes, though.  Another totally different roll for him then in The Matrix and Lord of the Rings.  And, also Terrance Stamp!  He is so good as the ""women"" of the bunch!  Very good performance by him, I liked him much better in this then in Superman 2.  Costumes are awesome too, actually they won the Academy Award for them.  On a note for parents...  This movie does use the ""F-word"" a few too many times, and there are many sexual references (which is kinda a duh because they are drag queens and transvestites).  But over all it's a pretty fun film. Oh and for the Guy Pearce fans (like me)...  Just be prepared for a fun ride, with a interesting drag queen...  hehe For the grade for this movie I give it a 9/10...  Which is an A in my book ^_^",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Fabulous,"Yes, it is filled with stereotypes. Yes, that should be a bad thing. But it isn't. Priscilla has been a favorite of mine for so long. It is charming, funny, and a great movie to sing along to. Yes, the characters are stereotypical. But I personally know people who are JUST LIKE each of the characters. And the jokes, the one liners, are laugh out loud funny, even after 3 or 4 or 50 times. The makeup is spectacular, the costuming is incredible. The shots of the Australian outback are magnificent. And underneath it all there is a vivacious, bubbly innocence that creeps under your skin and makes you feel good.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Overrated,"To me, this is just an OK film. Even after buying it on DVD, I can't be bothered to watch it twice. No disrespect to the leading actors, who all did a good job, but it just isn't very deep, moving, involving or complex.Surely the only way this film is above average is as a nice feel-good film for people attracted or entertained by the lifestyles at its core. Come on, we all know a feel-good film when we see it.. I can't see any other reason anyone should give this anything more than 5 or 6 out of 10. The plot and character development are easily outdone by good TV. For me, some of the film is patronising: the aborigines getting into the show smacks of right-on political correctness. I can't help but wonder would that happen in real life? This reminds me of when they had an old black guy dancing in a Rick Astley video, to ""show"" that although Rick as a thin ginger white boy from Lancashire, working for Stock Aitken and Waterman, he was in fact a real Soul singer, as demonstrated by the way this black waiter got into the music. We've all seen this device used in lots of places (including politician's ads).There are 2 other cult films like this I've bought that have also fallen far short of their reputation: Easy Rider (dreadful rubbish), and Withnail and I (this last one is just about worth watching twice)I like Terence Stamp the best, a very dry performance - and the most convincing. Once again: not a dreadful film, but not a classic by any stretch of the imagination",5.0,Anonymous,Music
"""That's just what this country needs","This is the absolute best film ever made about drag queens. It follows the life of three Austrailian beauties as they make their way across the outback in their lavender bus (Priscilla).

"this 90s flamboyant drag cult made from Down Under is truly, a hoot and a half","Revisiting this 90s flamboyant drag cult made from Down Under, a trio of drag performers, two drag queens, Mitzi (Weaving) and Felicia (Pearce) and a trans-woman Bernadette (Stamp), embarks on a road trip on their titularly coined bus, from Sydney to the outback to perform their routines, en route, they meet multifarious people (whose reaction ranging from beneficent, gobsmacked, impassive, miffed to violent, and the juxtaposition between the aborigine and the white hicks is piercingly sharp) and each has his/her own generational revelation to cope with by the time their four-week-stint ends.Felicia, a sassy whippersnapper played by a sinewy Guy Pearce in his breaking-out cinema role, who constantly squabbles with Bernadette and has to learn his lesson in a hard way after he has a narrow escape from hate-crime induced mutilation, and Pearce is barnstorming to a fault, as if he is too self-aware of his orthodox masculine appearance, which he compensates with a patina of overlown effeminate affectation and posturing that runs to distracting, as we know that queer and masculine don't necessarily exclude each other, perceivably, he is the weakest link in the fold.Hugo Weaving's Mitzi, acting more natural in his persona's stage/private distinction, carries a more weighty responsibility when we realize he is married to a woman and they have an eight-year-old son Benji (Holmes), the burden of guilt and shame is what weighs down on every nonconformist being's soul, his tentative attempt to reconnect with Benj engages with a tender vulnerability that precariously avoids becoming saccharine, which says a lot about the performer's emotive strength.Nevertheless, the best performance unequivocally comes from Terence Stamp, whose Bernadette is long in the tooth, but she proves that wisdom, dignity and snide quips are amassed through years of hardened self-preservation against side-eyes and brandishing fists, Stamp embodies her with superlative poise larded with subtle cynicism and utter phlegm, which makes Bernadette's romantic kindling with a rough diamond Bob (Hunter) more like an unexpected boon than a hackneyed plot maneuver.The show must go on, and for a drag troupe of three, lip-syncing of queer-friendly iconic hits (Charlene's I'VE NEVER BEEN ME is an infectious show opener, which would be dusted off in Lynne Ramsay's YOU WERE NEVER REALLY HERE 2017, and rendered an idiosyncratically poignant effect) is just a one trick pony doesn't offer much variations, so their pageantry lives and dies with its gaudy, zany, eye-popping, varicolored, Oscar-winning apparel, particularly when being put into use against the vast topography in the middle of nowhere, and the crowning moment on the top of King's canyon, that majesty feeling of being unique in a cosmic world is so refreshing and life-affirming.Lastly, one cannot stress this enough, it is an unqualified relief that director/writer Stephan Elliott sticks to his guns with a less dramatic leitmotif to anchor his tragedy-prone subject matter in the most gracious way one can probably conceive, PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT is truly, a hoot and a half.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Excellent costumes!,"This film is about two drag queens and a transsexual woman's journey into the middle of nowhere in the Australian desert. They performed drag shows in the conservative areas, with predictable reaction.The script can easily be seen to be entertaining and humorous. What I find the most entertaining are the costumes. The endless parade of colourful and flamboyant costumes is dazzling and breathtaking to say the least. What amazes me the most is the scene in which a drag queen stands on top of a traveling bus, with her costume stretching tens of metres in the wind. The tail of the costume flies and waves in the wind, it is so graceful and beautiful, as if it was a demonstration of their pride to the world!I also applaud the filmmakers for making a film about this topic. It is not every day that films like these get made!",,Anonymous,Music
Great costumes highlight  this desert road trip. (spoilers),"For some reason, I had the premonition that the Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert was a sort of lavish fantasy tale set in the desert. Like a drag queen version of Alice in Wonderland or something like that, and particularly it was the outrageous (but spectacular) costumes which had me thinking this, in addition to never having seen the previews.This is the story of two drag queen friends (Hugo Weaving and Guy Pierce) and their transsexual friend (Terrence Stamp) who get the idea to travel to some isolate town in Australia and perform at a hotel in a cabaret show. Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, refers to their vintage bus which takes the trio to an odd assortment of locations along the way with its irritating knack for frequently breaking down. In a way, this is a typical sort of road trip film of friends bonding over harder soul-searching moments, particularly among Bernie (Stamp) who recently lost his companion and Mitzi (Weaving) who is summoned to this little town by his wife who asks for his help with ""something."" In a sort of way of painting the town red, the trio do tend to light up the bland and almost alien life with their outrageous costumes (and it seems that the actors change clothes in nearly every scene) and disco-days performances, awing some and angering others and it seems those who are the most understanding are those who themselves at some point have been ostracized.It is a great film that offers a lot of laugh and the sort of wit so familiar to comedies such as these. I thought it was ridiculous to place the costume designer on one of those idiotic 'Worst Dressed' lists for her credit-card dress design, considering it complimented the art direction of this film quite nicely. These were by far some of the best costumes on film.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Confidential"", and General Zod from ""Superman II"") gallivanting around in drag. The film did not disappoint.I did find parts of the movie lacking: There is very little conflict in the overall plot, and of the three main characters, only Terrance Stamp has any kind of dimension (more time should have been spent with Mitzie, by default the movie's main character). Also, I find fault with the scene where a certain part of a guy's anatomy is stuck in a bathtub's drain- although humorous, I doubt the mechanics of the whole thing (Trust me, I went through a series of scientific experiments at home to prove this).But over all, I really enjoyed it. The acting is grand, the soundtrack is superb (and I, for one, like ABBA) and the dialog is fantastic. The insults come fast and are all crackling with wit. So I do recommend this movie.

Slightly Overlong... but Great!,"I first saw Priscilla: Queen of the Desert at a friend's house with nothing much else to watch. Whislt I'd heard very little of the film before, I'd obviously heard of the stage show and was aware of the film's content. Priscilla is a great film, because it doesn't only provide its audience with the campy jokes and snappy one-liners that are accustomed with films such as this, it also has a lot of heart. I adore films that express brave choices in casting, as Priscilla does just this with Terrence Stamp playing a transsexual and the whole thing works so well. Its academy award for best costume design is extremely well-deserved and I also enjoyed some of the almost surrealist touches to the film. At some points the unfolding of events on screen resembles a Salvador Dali painting for example the scene in which one of the 'Queens' rides atop their bus in a large shoe, painting the desert with pink dust. I couldn't help but feel however that the film was a tad overlong. A lot of the content felt slightly drawn out, but its still definitely worth a watch.

"Amusing, but not as good as it could be","Alright. This movie is definitely interesting experience. A drama about drag queens. Now I myself have never been a fan of men's choice dressing up as women and parading around, but I am not against it. It's their choice of life. But if you have some problem with this choice of life, well then don't condemn this movie. That's YOUR problem. I suppose this film sends the same sort of message that anti-racist and pro-homosexual movies send. That there is nothing wrong with being different. I guess the fact, that this specific message is applied to the life of a drag queen, is quite original, because there are very few movies about these sort of people. But it could have been better. It seemed for me, that the idea did not reach it's full potential. I mean take the movie 'Milk'(2008) or Ang Lee's 'Brokeback Mountain' for example. They also send a same sort of message, about being different and all... And those movies just blew me away. After seeing them I was left paralyzed by their greatness for quite some time. This movie did not have that impact. But it's still nice to see it for it's good intention. And another REALLY interesting thing to watch here was Hugo Weaving, Guy Pearce and Terance Stamp in their REALLY colorful roles as drag queen's. Never in my life had I even imagined to see Hugo Weaving - Agent Smith from the 'Matrix' - one of the coolest bad ass characters ever, in the most eye blowing over-colored women's dress with HUGE feather's and make-up AND parading around ABBA's 'Mama Mia'.IT WAS HIILARIOUS!It really is an amusing movie for open and accepting people.

The movie stayed away from ""To Wong Foo""'s message of ""See, drag queens are people too"" and just let these people live their fabulous lives and we can choose to come along for the ride or not. I also didn't get a sense, as in ""La Cage Aux Folle"", of the gay lifestyle being put up as a laughingstock. The characters were allowed to be well rounded people, with families and concerns in life beside costumes and acting ""fabulous"". See this movie.

Fabulous!,"'Priscilla' is a road trip movie where two drag queens and a transsexual (MTF) journey through the outback on their way to their next perfoarmance venue.'Priscilla' compares favorably to ""To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar"". Both movies share plot elements. But where 'Wong Foo' falls flat with formulaic plot, shallow characters, and rigid acting, 'Priscilla' delivers.Bernadette (Terrance Stamp) is the eldest, and has the most character of the group (being a transsexual, having her lover die, etc.). Hunky and shallow Felicia (Guy Pearce) provides plenty of eye-candy, filling out dresses with muscle to spare. Pearce's flamboyant characterization of Felicia was on target and the level of detail is amazing to watch.Mitzi (Hugo Weaving) provides the group's direction by setting up the trip. Unfortunately, Weaving is a bit flat at times, leaving the audience to guess at some of his reactions. When Felicia jests at the possibility that Mitzi has a son, Weaving's reaction should have revealed the truth behind the remark.The plot was well developed but a bit shallow. While the characters had background stories and personalities, there was no real motivations or conflicts for the characters to grow by.I liked that 'Priscilla' didn't pull any punches. When someone asks what sort of performers they are, Felicia explains that they dress up in womens clothing and lip sync to music. A few plot points were missed on the first viewing and could have been made clearer.While obviously a budget film, the technical aspects of the film fared well. Some of the scenery was captured nicely, along with a variety of costumes. A minor point was getting over the Australian accent and lingo.I enjoyed 'Priscilla' and would watch it again.

At this point I cannot tell one actor from another, but I thought the depiction of the character who is married and has a child was best.
