"Sometimes frustrating, generally great.","Former star, Riggan Thomas, once famed for playing superhero Birdman, tries to get his career back on track, writing, starring and directing a Broadway play.I can't lie, I quit when I first tried to watch it, I got twenty minutes in, and struggled, I found it a little too heavy, this time I stuck with it til the credits rolled.I'm so glad I stuck with it this time round, it took a little time for me to get into it, initially I found it quite pretentious, but it does settle, and genuinely becomes quite engrossing. The turning point came for me, when Riggan receives a roasting from his daughter, it really helps explain where he's at.Sublime cinematography, it's a gorgeous looking film, the camera work is impeccable, the film flows incredibly well. You also get to see a great deal of Edward Norton.The cinematography is great, but even that is trumped by the acting, some superb performances. Art does seem to imitate life, it seemed relevant for Keaton, who of course played Batman, but definitely had a lean spell, his performance here was spellbinding.Credit to Edward Norton, Emma Stone and Andrea Riseburgh, I thought the whole supporting cast were excellent.There was a massive hype surrounding this film, I understand why it's loved, I can't say I deem it as a masterpiece, it's somehow too niche for that, it's definitely going to alienate some viewers, the mood was right for me tonight though, I thoroughly enjoyed it.If you haven't seen it, or quit early as I did, I urge you to give it a chance.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
What is wrong with people?,"I have a tendency to check user reviews on IMDb before watching a film. I was surprised to see how divided people were for Birdman. Most of the reviews were either 9-10 stars or 1 star. This made me want to watch the film even more and by the time I finished watching it, my faith in people had decreased by a little bit.Birdman is brilliant! This is not just an opinion, I wouldn't even consider it as one of my favourite films, I didn't even give 10 stars. When I say it is brilliant, I don't mean that I liked it too much, I mean that every aspect of the film is masterfully dealt with. Sublime acting, excellent cinematography, interesting and unconventional directing and a wonderfully original score. OK there wasn't a fast-paced plot with lots of plot twists, but not every movie has to be like this. One of the reviewers who gave one star complained about the plot and suggested to the readers to go watch a Kubrick film instead. Well, Kubrick himself made movies with minimal plot which were nevertheless proved to be masterpieces (2001: A space Odyssey, Eyes Wide Shut). He once said: ""A film is (or should be) more like music than fiction"". Films are supposed to make us think and feel, like music does. You can make a good song by adding story-like lyrics and you can make a good song by adding no lyrics at all. The same applies to movies. There are plot-driven masterpieces and there are no-plot- driven masterpieces. Birdman is one of the latter.I don't want to spoil the film. I just want to say that I would highly recommend it for anyone, except people who only want to see pointless action and superhero films. Birdman will make you think, reflect on similar situations you might have experienced and discover the other side of actors and films. I can absolutely understand people not liking it. There is not a single film that appeals to everyone. What I cannot understand though is people calling it a bad movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Hypnotising,"A washed-up ex-superhero actor is trying to make a mark on Broadway. Unfortunately, his new found want to make 'something serious', as opposed to superhero films, is challenged by the inability to shake his old persona.It's a film about Hollywood and its many personalities - the drug-addicted, the mentally unwell, the sexual abusers, the egotistical, the scathing critics, the stars and the has-beens. It's not a topic I particularly care for and I didn't enjoy Tarantino's 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' or Alma Har'el/Shia Lebeouf's 'Honey Boy'.Birdman, however, hypnotised me. You're greeted by snaking, daydream-like single shots that seem stretch forever, one scene flowing effortlessly into another through a combination of clever camera work, editing, and special effects. In short, it's a cinematographic dream. The high-conflict scenes, action, script, and larger than life characters glue your eyes to the screen in this rollercoaster that's effortless to watch. For a film about Hollywood, you'd expect good acting, and it certainly didn't disappoint, whether from Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, or the rest of the talented cast.Birdman thrusts you into supernaturalism briefly, before thrusting you back to reality. It leaves it up to you how to interpret some key events and this creates division within the audience.I understand why some dislike the film. I didn't find it meaningful, deep, or clear to what its message was. However, its punchy style was refreshingly new, worked perfectly, and is reason alone for cinephiles to delve into this engaging whirlwind of a film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Life Imitating Art or Art Imitating Life...Can Anyone Tell the Difference? Does It Really Matter?,"BIRDMAN just keeps coming at you, time and again, from every imaginable angle, until the end credits, about an hour and 50 minutes in. Is it just me ....or are many reviewers reluctant to state the obvious? Michael Keaton as a down on his luck Ex-Superhero, desperately trying to prove his relevance in 2015, to the entire world, to his rather distant family, but, probably most of all, to himself. Oh yeah, and he talks to himself in a rather smooth, but hoarse and gravelly BATMAN...I mean BIRDMAN, Superhero voice, his last on screen portrayal of which was in 1992! (Yes, in BOTH of them)So, just where do we draw the line as to what is fact and what is fiction? That is one of many recurring themes dealt with in BIRDMAN. I think it is the central one in the film.... Just where and when do we draw those critical dividing lines? Riggan Thompson is feeling the rapidly escalating pressure of a quickly approaching Broadway opening. It is a dilemma of his own device. His life is in shambles. He finds himself still pining for his ex, while attempting, rather ineptly and intermittently, to bond with his daughter. He has taken on overpowering debt to finance his Broadway play that, if successful, will provide him with the self-vindication he needs to put his life and career back on track. His problems seem insurmountable, or at least, he has convinced himself that they are!The ensemble cast performance is deliciously superb. Zach Galifianakis as the steadfastly single-minded lawyer/best friend, who has to employ his myriad of abilities to hold the production together and keep it moving forward. Emma Stone, as Sam, the more often than not neglected as a child daughter, just out of Rehab, who seems to be on the road to stability in her life by serving as the reluctant gofer for her neophyte Broadway director/producer father. Naomi Watts, as Lesley, one of the play's stars, perhaps the star struck little girl trapped in the 30 something body of a struggling actor who is on the verge of her lifelong Broadway wish- fulfillment debut!Edward Norton delivers an Oscar-caliber performance as the obsessed Method actor who's only real moments are the ones he spends on stage. And of course, Michael Keaton, in the title role, projecting a gigantic on screen presence as a man possessed, obsessed, intensely flawed, human and, ultimately, somewhat skewed by his own inner demons! Makes you wonder... Exactly where does Michael Keaton end and Riggan Thompson begin?I would be derelict in my reviewer duties were I not to mention the effective and original use of the continuous, one-take technique employed in making BIRDMAN...It lends an extreme presence, intensity and intimacy to the overall quality and tone of the film which is quite unique. I'm sure the implementation of this style presented director Alejandro González Iñárritu with a formidable series of challenges, which he dealt with flawlessly. Gonzalez has directed some previously highly recognized films, such as Amorres Perros, 21 Grams, Babel and Biutiful. This highly thought provoking film guarantees that we will be seeing more of his work in the future.10**********....... ENJOY! / DISFRUTELA!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
for once the academy got it right,"With all due respect to Eastwood's American Sniper, the academy actually got it right with this pick for best picture. Every actor and actress in this given the space to breathe life into characters, every monologue and dialogue hits like a ton of bricks, every scene tries to get towards some fundamental truth of human nature only to have the next scene undermine that character and that purported truth. It's amazing that in the era of comic book universe movies that something like this can get made at all. An absolute must see before you die movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"Very much a divisive film, to me it was a 2014 highlight","Despite the near-universal acclaim from critics, 'Birdman' very much divided audiences to a quite extreme degree. This division is very much understandable, 'Birdman' has a great many merits but not everything will work for everybody.To me 'Birdman' was an excellent film. Maybe not quite as good as the hype suggests, but nowhere near deserving of the many 1/10 votes when its merits are a great many that some people seem to have not acknowledged. Although, from personal opinion, a little over-hyped, 'Birdman' ('Gone Girl', 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' and 'Whiplash' were also personal favourites, and 'Boyhood' was also better than given credit for considering the amount of hate it's garnered) was a 2014 highlight and a worthy Best Picture winner.Not everything in 'Birdman' works. Some of the pace is a touch frenetic in parts of the second half and not everything feels quite as tied up as ought with things left a little loose.However, 'Birdman' is an exceptionally well made film, with some of the best and cleverest cinematography of the year, some of the cinematography and editing is so dazzling it's enough to take the breath away. The special effects are also tremendous. Directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu (in the first of his deserved director wins, the best being 2015's 'The Revenant), 'Birdman' is one of the best directed films of 2014 too and shows Iñárritu's immense talent as a director, with breath-taking vision, sense of mood and the ability to make the story as gripping as possible.The script is fun, thought-provoking and at times touchingly profound. The story mostly, while sometimes thin, is gripping and the characters engage.Michael Keaton gives his best performance in years, an outstanding performance and perhaps a career-best. Edward Norton is similarly superb, his performance also ranking among his best. Emma Stones charms and delights too.Overall, very much divisive, with some people adoring or admiring it and others hating it, personally was one of the people who loved it while acknowledging its imperfections. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
It's satire people!,"I have to say I am shocked and how many bad reviews I have seen on this site for this movie. It seems to me that the majority of moviegoers who have chosen to review here are only capable of viewing a movie at face value.This movie is clearly a satirical look at Hollywood and the constant need to remain relevant in the entertainment industry.I will admit that the film does appear unnecessarily ""artsy"" in places, but some Hollywood actors love being unnecessarily artsy as they think it gives them depth.That was the entire point of this film, for Hollywood to turn the camera on itself and expose all of it's own crap.What I took from this film is what I have always felt about Hollywood, which is also what I love about it. Actors are inherently insecure, which is why they choose to be in an industry where there is a need for constant approval. The actors who are worth their salt risk everything to entertain...us. For that they will forever have my respect.Definitely worth watching and worthy of it's Best Picture Oscar.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
True Definition Of A Masterpiece,"Whilst viewing 'Birdman', I spent the first hour of the film trying to decipher my emotions and opinions towards it, what I was watching was a weird, yet wonderful work of art. Truly though, 'Birdman' is a technical masterpiece. Michael Keaton has generally been undermined as an actor (despite a few notable roles as Batman or Beetlejuice) and has instead faced Hollywood picking more acclaimed and popular actors, 'Birdman' however might just be his ticket to an Oscar nomination, and possibly even a win, his performance is mesmerising. Alejandro González Iñárritu has created a truly spectacular character study that arguably features this year's strongest acting performances, alongside a well- executed script, booming soundtrack and a monumental achievement with cinematography from Emmanuel Lubezki in which he attempts a Hitchcockian approach, reminiscent of 'Rope', and displays the story through a seemingly single and unbroken sweeping shot. This is the true definition of a masterpiece.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Entertaining,"A former Hollywood superstar (Michael Keaton) was famous as a film superhero over twenty years ago. He attempts a comeback to fame by writing, directing, and starring in a Broadway play.Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, shows the same adept work in ""Birdman"" as he did in his best works ""Amores Perros"" and ""Babel"". There is almost a playful way the camera moves through the thin zigzag halls of the backstage of the theatre, giving the viewers the experience of the cast and crew in their daily work.Overall, there is a welcome liveliness in ""Birdman"", not only in the directing, but also in the acting. Keaton heads a solid cast that also includes Edward Norton (a standout), Emma Stone, Naomi Watts, and Zach Galifianakis.The story is good but might have been better considering the other achievements in this film. It seems to be trying to grasp something that is profound but only partly hits the mark. Also, a few cheap and old tricks lower the overall effect. A sitcom gag of being ""locked out"" in a very inconvenient way is decades old. Also, the cheap thrill of a spontaneous ""girl-on-girl"" kissing scene may not be as old but it's just as stale.""Birdman"" is still an enjoyable experience especially considering that Keaton (who was a superstar in two ""Batman"" movies over twenty years ago) might possibly be playing himself. - dbamateurcritic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"Fascinating, but not for all tastes","I absolutely loved the film. From the colors to the amazing camera work and the brilliant performances, it was a masterpiece.

Beautiful mess...,"It's chaotic and loses focus now and again, but it is ambitious with some of the best acting you will see in any movie this year. It is witty and self aware and there are many who simply won't ""get it"". If your tastes lean more to the obvious or straight forward, this is not the movie for you. If you like imaginative, challenging, and visually stunning films that deal with ego, passion, love, weakness, insecurity and redemption, this is worth your time.Unfortunately some subplots are completely forgotten and character arcs begun but not finished, but there is so much rewarding here to be found these are mostly forgiven shortcomings. The editing and scene structure plays like a stream of consciousness, but the consciousness of a very neurotic person. And while there are several standout performances in a uniformly excellent cast, Keaton is the the focus and he is amazing. He runs the gauntlet of neurosis and desperation and pulls it off with an amazing balancing act between insanity and relatability. Perhaps not the best film of the year, but a very memorable one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
An excellent film with insanely unique filmography,"An excellent piece.

Certainly an Ambiguous Challenge,"Michael Keaton and Edward Norton are terrific. They are wonderful actors in nearly every sense of the word. I was engaged most of the way, but then the flying sequences. He is indeed a broken man. He is probably schizophrenic, listening to himself discuss his failures through the persona of the character he used to play. Enough has been written about this movie (it was the darling of the Oscars) for me to offer much. Nevertheless, I feel that we need to play fair with the audience. If this was a demonstration of what is wrong with Broadway and the Broadway crowd, let us know. There is a great scene where he confronts a powerful theatre critic who can make or break a show with a bad review (I never understood the power of these people) and chastises her for her vindictiveness and and arrogance in ruining peoples lives when she, herself, must not face the music. I'm sure her editors would disagree, but what he says is true. Unfortunately, as we roll to the end, we are made to make up our minds. I suppose it's OK not to be one with the character, but the ending is truly ambiguous, to a fault. Fantastic acting by the whole cast, yet it left me really cold at the end.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Stage Play on the Screen,"I'll start by saying this movie is worth seeing at least once, at least to see what it is doing. It is shot much like Hitchcock's *Rope*, though not exactly. It isn't all one shot, but there are many shots that flow from scene to scene. The catch? Those scenes are not always chronologically continuous. This is a fact you very well might miss if you are distracted or have something inhibiting you (the theatre I watched it in first however many years ago had abysmal audio, so this was me the first time).This may sound disorienting, but if you change the way you are viewing the movie, I think it will help. Don't look at it as a standard movie: instead, view it as a stage play whose stage is an entire neighborhood, mostly one building, and which was mostly captured as it was being performed by a cameraman. This means that the actors moving in and out of scene have the same flow that a stage play has, and this also explains the presence of the drummer that you randomly see in the background performing the soundtrack to the movie. (Yes, the soundtrack is mostly a drummer; it works really well somehow.)There's only one tiny wrench in this, the movie has all sorts of elements that are generally assumed to be hallucinations or imaginings of the main character (Keaton). In different scenes where he is alone, we see him using various telekinetic powers. Occasionally, we actually see his younger self as Birdman (an action-movie role from his younger days) in person, although usually he just antagonizes him via voice over. Some of the few hard cuts in the movie that do not follow an actor from one room to another are used to establish that the telekinesis in the previous scene is probably just Keaton throwing stuff around the room in anger.How to reconcile this is... well, difficult. It certainly plays with the tension between stage plays and movies. In neither is everything you see always taken literally, but in stage plays it is much more figurative (hence the bending of time and space from scene to scene). But on stage, you usually can't perform the kinds of special effects (characteristic of movies) that we are being asked not to take literally. (I'm trying to stay spoiler free, so I'll not say what I'm thinking right now.)This is where we should look at the themes of the movie, because these formal elements in conflict that I mentioned mirror the thematic conflict between cinema and theatre. Long story short, the premise of the mov... (movie? . . . stageplay? . . . ) ...of the story is that Keaton is a has-been actor, known (very well known) for superhero movies he did ten or twenty years ago, all based around a character named Bat*coughs* I mean, Birdman.Sound familiar? Okay, good. Well the inciting incident in the story is that he is trying to reclaim his career as an actor in general, and with it his artistic street-cred, so to speak, by writing (adapting), directing, and starring in a play. It is based on a novel by someone who encouraged him to be an actor when he was a child. Therefore, this isn't a move of cold calculation, trying to get famous again after years of not being as successful as he was as Birdman and therefore being artistically inauthentic, although he is certainly accused of this. But it is instead a very real attempt to reconnect with his younger, artistic self, before Birdman, which he sees as the inauthentic detour of his career and as not what he wants to be remembered for.The conflict is, he seems to be finding that the film world doesn't translate to the stage world. He seems to be hitting the problem that there may not be such a thing as an ""actor-in-general"" but only two separate things called ""stage-actor"" and ""screen-actor."" On multiple occasions, this film criticizes the spectacles that saturate Hollywood and the celebrity culture it grows in the Petri dish of its award shows. Edward Norton plays his foil, someone else who finds himself on stage more than he does in his natural life, yet a stage insider, rather than a film one.The film isn't all anti film culture, however. In many ways, film has its last laugh when we see that the kinds of things that make the theatre-world fall in love with you and fawn over your talent are superficial as well.The formal conflict inherent in how the film is delivered therefore mirrors the thematic content that is being delivered, which is almost always the optimum result.In other words, I have a lot of respect for this movie. I rate it 9 stars because that is how I say I think everyone should give it a fair chance.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

The Definition of a Masterpiece,"I don't know how to start a movie review off, seeing as I've never written one. I feel my meager rating out-of-ten is enough information to tell those interested what I think of a particular movie. Birdman, however, is the exception.I understand I'm an absolute stranger. Who gives a damn about what I have to think? My only hope is that after reading one fan's fanatic praise for Birdman, you will go and see it. In the interest of not over-hyping this movie (which many will feel I'm about to do), I will say it's nothing short of utterly amazing. Every aspect of the film is masterfully crafted and executed. Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography only exemplifies this. The brilliant choice of always having the camera rolling lets the viewer see what happens before and after any given event. This added information creates a realism unknown to nearly every other movie ever made. What better way to capture the raw emotion and awkward stumbling of an angry outburst at your father than to show the immediate reaction of the ranter following her outburst; you get to see the anger slowly fade from her face as the reality of what she said sets in. Details like this are so often lost and these often- lost, immersive subtleties are what make Birdman the gargantuan triumph it is. Not to mention some of the transitions and dolly shots are just damn impressive.Even though many movies are yet to come out this pre-Oscar season, I feel it is safe to say no other casting ensemble will come close to the performances given in Birdman. Michael Keaton, Zach Galifianakis, Emma Stone, Ed Norton, Amy Ryan, and every single other actor in the production execute their roles with professionalism that most movies are lucky to see in just one of their actors. Each actor didn't wait for their time to shine to pull out the big guns; every moment of screen time was utilized to its full potential. There isn't a second where the audience's immersion is broken by an awkwardly delivered line or a slightly out-of-place facial expressions or emotion.The only criticism I have about the film is that more aren't like it. A smart, satirical movie that is capable of criticizing without being hypocritical is unfortunately rare. However, it's rather nice to have movies like this stand out from the crowd instead of being the norm, because the relative quality only makes them that much better.So, in short, I implore you. I beg you. If you step into a movie theater once this year, let it be to watch this film. It deserves your attention.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Alejandro is the Real Deal,"This movie really touch my soul in very different ways, I was laughing and crying at the same time when I was watching it. Alejandro's clean smooth directing really states a new canon in the way a movie is conducted, I was blown away with Michael Keaton's perfect performance and the rest of the cast did well around him. I had never seen this kind of genre called ""Magical realism"" as well as in this movie, it really submerge you inside the head of the main character and the brilliant drum-based score helps to explain the situation by the minute. I am very happy with the Oscars won by Alejandro (well deserved) especially because I am Mexican too. I know that this kind of movie is not for everyone, some people said that it is boring, pretentious, over-the- top, strange, difficult to understand, hideous. But let me tell you this movie is fascinating, touching, funny, sad, eloquent, fantastic and dramatic. I liked very much how it makes fun of big-budget summer-blockbusters hero-movies which easily Alejandro will have done if he had wanted but no, he preferred an artistic low budget movie that make you feel instead of make you eat popcorn.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"Good parts, but the film is too familiar and seems quite overrated.","At this time, ""Birdman"" has a phenomenal IMDb score of 8.7 and has been talked about a lot in regards to the Oscars. Whether the film does get the nominations (particularly for Michael Keaton) is something we'll know in the next few weeks. As for me, however, I really do think the film is quite overrated--and the biggest reason is that so much of it I've seen before--such as in Fellini's ""8 1/2"" and a few films that have copied this, such as Woody Allen's ""Stardust Memories"". The movie, at least to crazed film buffs like me, just lacks the originality to be a great film and it seems overrated.As for the film, it's about a down and out actor who USED to be a big star back when he starred in superhero movies (like Keaton in real life). Now, decades later, he's attempting a comeback-- starring and directing in a Broadway play. The film is, generally, a behind the scenes look at what it's like during a production. But, it is also punctuated with very strange, surreal fantasy scenes--VERY reminiscent of Marcello Mastroianni's little fantasies in ""8 1/2"". In fact, there are so many that it's difficult to know what REALLY is happening at times.I loved parts of the film. Many little bits and pieces made me smile or connected with me. But, at the same time, I struggled with liking the film because so many of the characters were either completely unlikable or were underdeveloped. This, combined with the unevenness of the script and familiarity of the style, the film didn't do much for me. Did I enjoy seeing it? Not especially, but I am glad I did see it-- and assume folks not familiar with ""8 1/2"" would probably like the film much more than me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
audacious concept,"Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) is famous for his role as comic book superhero Birdman.

His daughter Sam (Emma Stone) works as his grumpy assistant. Lesley (Naomi Watts) acts in the play. When a light falls on the lead, Lesley suggests headliner Mike Shiner (Edward Norton). Mike is a method actor who gets on Riggan's nerves.The concept of long continuous scenes is interesting. It adds to the level of difficulty. It is audacious and makes the audience sit up to pay attention. Although this movie does not take place in real time. It's not 2 hours of Riggan's life. There is one amazing scene with Keaton in his underwear. There is a daring in that it is outside in the real world. It adds a higher level of energy and that scene buzzes. The standout performance is Norton. He's got the most fun character. Everybody does a great job especially Galifianakis, Stone and of course Keaton.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
More than amazing acting for an story seen hundred times,"That ""Birdman"" is a self-conscious movie, that thinks too high of itself and that doesn't care is obvious from the moment it starts. For sure, it looks beautiful, and the actors do an amazing job, but this doesn't change the fact that the movie is looking at itself the whole time and saying: I'm great.The story doesn't really matter. Washed-up actor Riggan (a Michael Keaton that eats the screen and keeps the movie going even in its low points) decides to put a Broadway play where he will be director, actor and adapt an story by Raymond Carver. That's all an excuse for cool camera work, meta-dialogues, tongue-in-cheek situations and the same story of actor that wants to give himself a last chance, that left his family for his work, that is known by a blockbuster but not recognized by his acting... It has to be said that all the actors more than deliver, because behind Michael Keaton's center piece, Edward Norton, Emma Stone, Zach Galifianakis (more toned down than usually, which is an improvement) or Naomi Watts do an excellent job. Iñárritu's work with scenery is very good too, showy but assured.But that the movie knows that it's playing with the convention doesn't save from itself patting its own back constantly, with even some unnecessary shots at blockbusters, plastic surgery, etc... You don't have to tell that you are great if you are really great.Nonetheless, it is a movie really worth watching, even if it is just to see Michael Keaton's astonishing interpretation.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"Using the ""M"" Word Again...Masterpiece!","I think we've all been exceptionally good this year because Christmas came early with Alejandro González Iñárritu's masterful ""Birdman (or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance),"" an experience that you won't soon forget. Debuting at Venice and Telluride Film Festivals, the film closed an already impeccable New York Film Festival on Saturday morning for press and industry colleagues. It's a film that resonates profoundly, and may just be the best film of 2014. From its pristine writing (by Iñárritu, Armando Bo, Nicolas Giacobone, and Alexander Dinelaris), to its carefully constructed direction and cinematography, to its genius casting and performances, ""Birdman"" is just a dream of a movie.The movie tells the story of Riggan (Michael Keaton), a washed up actor who used to play a superhero icon called Birdman. In a valiant attempt to reclaim his career, he adapts, directs, and stars in a Broadway play. With problems from one of his very method actors (Edward Norton), assistant daughter (Emma Stone), emotional co-star (Naomi Watts), overly sexual girlfriend (Andrea Riseborough), flamboyant producer (Zach Galifanakis), and loving ex- wife (Amy Ryan), Riggan prepares for the breaking point of his career.""Birdman"" is so damn enjoyable and one of the most entertaining films in years. It charms not just because of its story, but because of the performances and slick way that co-writer/director Iñárritu plays with tone. It's downright hilarious in parts, probably the funniest film of the year, and then there's the dramatic edge that comes into play, and simply breaks your heart. Above all, Iñárritu's ""Birdman"" is a celebration of cinema. It's an audacious achievement that floors just about every aspect of film witnessed in 2014. Iñárritu already had vocal admirers from ""Amores Perros,"" ""Babel,"" and ""Biutiful,"" but this is his most accessible. This will move him up in the ranks with the Scorsese's, Spielberg's, and Eastwood's. He familiarizes us with the stage and the theater. He makes the surroundings a very palpable character for us to know and enjoy.At 63, Michael Keaton has been criminally underutilized in his career, despite some iconic performances. The nerd crowd will worship him as the ideal Bruce Wayne/Batman combo, while the same thick will remember his ""Beetle Juice"" fondly for all-time. Where Keaton was passed over was for his dramatic capabilities. I've beat the horse dead on mentioning his cancer-stricken father-to-be performance in ""My Life"" or his recovering alcoholic player in ""Clean and Sober."" In ""Birdman,"" Keaton marries the two with an undeniable sensibility that stands as the actor's finest to date. It's such a studied turn, you feel the accuracy and precision in which he executes every move and mannerism of Riggan. It's the role that Keaton has been waiting decades for. It's the role of his career.If we're talking about underutilized actors, then Edward Norton needs to be mentioned. Two brilliant performances under his belt, both Oscar-nominated (""Primal Fear"" and ""American History X"") but both passed over for someone else, Norton is back and better than ever. A scene-stealing standout, Norton makes us realize how unspoken dialogue between characters can be just as humorous without the punchline. Emma Stone has finally arrived with ""Birdman."" Criminally misused and passed over by Hollywood for ""bigger name"" actresses, Stone finally shows the world what they've been missing. In one single scene, Stone revolutionizes and captures the essence of ""Birdman"" with a ferocity that you couldn't see from any other performer. She finds the heart and soul of Sam, laying her on the screen meticulously and transparent.Though brief in screen time, the vivacious Naomi Watts, the sexy Andrea Riseborough, and the seasoned Amy Ryan make their marks exquisitely. Watts gets the most chuckles out of the ladies while Ryan has the greatest arc for us to explore. I hope and pray that Zach Galifianakis continues down a path in independent cinema. Fully realized and delivered, he layers the film with a beautiful sympathy, vocal and restrained, he finds the meaning of Riggan and presents him to us.Emmanuel Lubezki. That is a sentence, statement, and just pure cinematic meaning nowadays. You can't watch a movie shot by the Academy Award winning Cinematographer and not find yourself more intimately contained and available to the realm of the movies. Just one year after stunning us with ""Gravity,"" Lubezki allows the audience to be in the movie. We are present in every scene, every movement, and every thought that a person is having. We feel as though Riggan and the cast are interacting with us. When they're laughing, we're laughing, when they're crying, we're crying. He is an absolute magician.This seems to be the year of the drums because Antonio Sanchez composes ""Birdman"" with a drum score that lays deep in my ear canals. Tapping your feet and bobbing your head, Sanchez elevates the film to new heights. Editors Douglas Prise and Stephen Mirrione may be the unsung heroes because in the film, we are nearly in one continuous take, which hardly ever gives up (at least to the untrained eye). In no way do I call myself someone who can spot a digital edit, but I spotted no more than a dozen cuts throughout. That is amazing. I'm sure there were dozens more, but you couldn't catch them.""Birdman"" is a masterpiece (there goes THAT word). At a time where movies feel like they have to choose to between comedy and tragedy, Iñárritu's beauty works on us from the inside-out. It's a human story, comedy, thriller, mystery, all rolled into one. All told by a master filmmaker and storytellers. The year's must-see experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

And sometimes they did not.As with Altman's films, some people really like Birdman. And some do not.So the real issue -- how did it win Best Picture?????????????????

Génial!,"Great opening at the Venice Film Festival with this must-see movie. The story of an actor persecuted by the role that made him popular, ""Birdman"", and pressured by the willing of proving himself on stage with his new play.The characters in the story are all struggling with something: Sam (Emma Stone) with her drug addiction, Mike (Edward Norton) with his sexual problems, Lesley (Naomi Watts) with her self- realization and Michael Keaton with love. What kind of love is he lacking? Is it admiration for his work? The same admiration that chained him to Bridman, who is probably the only one capable of saving him.The cinematography reminds of that used in Hitchcock's ""Rope"": it seems to be filmed consequently. The originality of the cinematography, though, may have sacrificed the storyline.""Birdman"" certainly needs to be seen more than one, but likewise certainly it's going to be one of the greatest movies of the year",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
A tour de force in acting with a highly quotable script,"At one point in Birdman ""or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)"", Michael Keaton as 'celebrity turned serious actor' Riggan Thomson rants at a vicious New York Times critic Tabitha (the excellent Lindsay Duncan – – ""About Time""; ""Dr Who: Waters of Mars"") about how all critics lamely fall on ""labels"" and ""comparisons"" to describe their subjects, never getting to the guts of how the art made them actually FEEL. And it made me FEEL like he was talking directly to me! So how did Birdman make me feel? What would be the snappy tag lines I would put on the poster?""Astonished""; ""Deeply impressed""; ""Full of wonder""; ""Slightly irritating"" (that one probably wouldn't make the poster).Birdman is definitely not a mainstream film, and it is likely to baffle and frustrate audiences almost as much as last year's almost impenetrable ""Under the Skin"". Riggan Thomson is part long-in-the-tooth actor and part superhero, at least in his fevered mind if not in reality. Surfing the C-list celebrity ocean following past glories in 'Birdman', 'Birdman 2′ and 'Birdman 3 (The Quest for Peace)', Thomson needs to prove to himself, his inner daemons and the world in general that he is a ""real actor"" by staging a play on Broadway. (In this regard, following Tim Burton's 1989 ""Batman"", this is almost art imitating life for Keaton). For this heroic effort he chooses a short play by Raymond Carver called ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"" adapting it to allow himself to shine in the spotlight.Thomson provides Broadway debuts for friend Lesley (Naomi Watts; ""King Kong""; ""The Impossible"") and crazy girlfriend Laura (Andrea Riseborough; ""Oblivion""; ""Brighton Rock""), but is less than impressed with his male co-star. 'Birdman' exits the guy with an ""accident"", but unfortunately that introduces a cuckoo into the acting nest in the form of famous actor Mike (Edward Norton), who risks completely upstaging Thomson with his theatrical brilliance.This introduction leads to one of the best laugh-out-loud lines of dialogue so far in 2015: ""How do you know Mike Shiner?"" asks Keaton; ""We share a vagina"" replies Watts.Again with this introduction, we see art imitating life, since Norton's performance (particularly in the first reel of the film) genuinely does risk outshining Keaton, despite all of his Oscar hype. I thought after ""Whiplash"" my choice for Best Supporting Actor was fairly safe with J.K Thompson . but after seeing Norton's performance I could see the race as much closer.Overall though this remains Keaton's film, and his performance is remarkable in an extremely varied and challenging role.Also remarkable is the gorgeously kooky Emma Stone as his sexually-louche and druggie daughter-cum-assistant Sam. This is particularly true in one astonishingly good rant to camera, where Stone delivers what could be termed an ""Anne Hathaway Les Miserable"" moment in its Oscar-worthyness. In each film, Stone is just getting better and better. I have said it before and will say it again, Stone is a future Streep in the making.As the previews of the play progress towards a dramatic opening night, Thomson's grip on reality continues to unravel, as pressures get forced on him from all sides: artistic via Shiner; financial via his managerial colleague Jake (a dramatically better Zach Galifianakis than in the ""Hangover"" series); and via parental guilt over the relationship with his daughter. His outbursts both as Thomson and (down two octaves) Birdman become more and more extreme and paranoid – ""I'm a f****** trivial pursuit question"" he rants at one point while destroying his dressing room in rock group style.The startlingly daring drum soundtrack by Antonio Sanchez actually counterpoints the action extremely well. Breaking down the fourth wall, the drummer keeps randomly appearing in a most surprising manner.So what of the ""Slightly irritating"" poster quote? Director Alejandro González Iñárritu undoubtedly delivers a tour de force of a film; an instant classic that will be poured over by film students for years to come. However, he delivers the whole film in the style of one continuous take (give or take the odd time lapse sequence). And whilst this was entertaining to start with, I personally started to find it tiresome and irritating by the end of the film. Like Hitchcock's ""Rope"", also filmed in this way, you are constantly distracted by looking for where the edits actually fall, sometimes seeing what looks to be an inconsistent couple of frames where perhaps no cut existed in the first place! Worthy of note though was Emmanuel Lubezki (""Gravity"") who's cinematography also bore many similarities to Hitchcock classic effects, including long drifting panning shots that appear to seamlessly melt through metal railings etc. Very impressive.In summary, this is a must see for lovers of the art of filmmaking, and Birdman should feature very strongly at the Oscars in a month's time.(If you enjoyed this review please see past reviews at bob-the-movie-man.com and enter your email on the site to receive future posts.

"Amazing! Turbulent, wild, funny, sincere.","This is an amazing film! Great acting and strong story, it will keep you on the edge of your seat. Some scenes had me laugh out loud. The film can get a little confusing or even perplexing at times, but in a good way. The soundtrack is original and supports the scenes brilliantly. The film is centered around a play (an adaptation of Raymond Carvers short story ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"", if you haven't read this: it is great). The cinematography couldn't be more spot one to refer to the fact that it is about theater. The magical realism might not be for everyone, and I am usually not a big fan, though in this film it gives the main character just the edge that it needs and it expresses his psyche well.In this film, all elements work together to create a turbulent, wild story that is both highly entertaining and arty: it is exiting; it is sincere; it is intelligent and amusing.

This is a tedious film,"I do apologise if I was supposed to get something meaningful out of this film for I didn't get anything much other than annoyed by it. Perhaps actors and others involved in cinema and theatre will walk away from having watched it, fairly gushing about same, seeing in it brilliant satire which pokes fun playfully at their business. All I did was check my watch repeatedly, wondering if the end of the second hour of it would arrive more quickly if only I checked my watch once or twice more.I wanted to like this movie, but I couldn't get into it at all. With a brilliant cast and an acclaimed director, it should have been so much more. Instead, all I was presented with were a handful of great performances that somehow didn't fit quite together and a film that was a touch too cute for its own good.

Too many sub plots opened then abandoned instead of being explored, and the whole super powers thing.

Interesting rift between reality and delusions of grandeur,"'Birdman' is the story of washed-up Hollywood actor Riggan (Michael Keaton) and his friend/producer Jake (Zach Galifianakis) trying to put together a Broadway play, despite all odds. With no money, poor casting choices, and a constant, nagging voice of his former self (a la Birdman), Riggan struggles to keep his grip on sanity and his freshman play.The whole movie is filmed in continuous shots; it is almost like a play itself, in that, there are very few cuts. There is a CGI element towards the end, and some almost telekinetic rage-filled moments, but everything else appears to be shot with regular people and props. The Birdman inner monologue that Riggan has to deal with is reminiscent of Tom Hardy's character in 'Venom' (2018) and, likewise, adds to the character's unique progression.It's worth a watch, but may be a little hard to follow at times.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

This is Broadway,"No sh*t. From the very beginning it's obvious that everyone here is a stage actor, even though they're not. The opening rehearsal scene is supposed to reveal that one of the actors is terribly overacting. But you quickly get the feeling that everyone is overacting.The rehearsal falls apart and they keep overacting. Zach Galifianakis does his best Richard Dreyfus impersonation. In fact, it's the best Dreyfus impersonation I've ever seen.When they're on stage they're stage acting. When they're off stage they're stage acting, only slightly less so.The music, such as it is - nothing but somebody jamming on the drums, or some child playing piano, is distracting.The camera work, just so much more cliché shaky-cam which has become so popular lately, makes it difficult to follow. And every opportunity for subtle nuances are lost. There should be a theory taught in film school - never move the camera unless you have a reason to. Because this dockers commercial BS is so 1990s. Get over it an move on to something new.Birdman is a fictional tale of a washed up action film actor trying to establish his importance as an artist. It's fiction and yet biographical. Michael Keaton, one of the most talented actors of our time, came to world-wide stardom in Batman. And ever since then it seems like his work has been underrated.In the end, it's an artsy-fartsy attempt at a meaningful story. There's nothing new here, it's all fairly predictable.

Sweeping cinematography mixed with brilliant performances makes Birdman one of the very best of the year.,"Birdman is a brilliant, mind blowing experience that is filled with grand performances, Hitchcock-esque camera movements and a brilliant way of storytelling. Above all, Birdman's all star cast featuring Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, Emma Stone and Zach Galifinakis propel this film to greatness, telling the story of a has been actor, Riggan, who was once known for a comic book franchise from yesteryear as he struggles to regain the stardom he once had through an off Broadway play. This proves to be harder and harder for Riggan as he deals with the disappointments of his own life while dealing with the difficulties of making this play his ticket back to stardom. This film serves as a somewhat personal film to Michael Keaton, giving the mere fact that he was known for playing Batman, a comic book hero eerily similar to Birdman. Keaton is an actor that proved time and time again that he can play virtually anything from heavy and hard hitting dramatic roles to silly and funny comedic roles as well. In Birdman, he strikes a perfect balance between the two and turns in the best performance of his entire career. He is firing on all cylinders and truly rises to perfection especially in scenes with an equally great Edward Norton. Another highlight of Birdman is the cinematography. First off, WOW. This film has some of the best cinematography I have seen in quite some time. Focusing on extremely long and spiraling takes, it submerses you in the scene, giving you the type of voyeuristic experience that Birdman calls for. We very much follow these actors as if we're watching a documentary on LSD. The camera movements are slow and bouncy, the tracking shots are nothing short of amazing and it gives an overall, dream like experience when watching this film, something that really benefits the film towards the latter half of it. I fully expect the film's Director of Photography Emmanuel Lubezki to score a Best Cinematography nomination come Oscar time. Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has given us some new age classic films such as Babel, Biutiful, and 21 Grams. Birdman is no exception and, to be honest, this very well may be his masterpiece. He directs his actors with grace and never lets them miss a beat and with some extreme long takes throughout the film, it shows just how good of a director he is and just how good his actors can be, especially Michael Keaton. Overall, I could go on and on about this film and just how great it is but nothing of what I say here can really do Birdman justice. It is a film that you need to experience for yourself. With that being said, Birdman features amazing performances including a jaw dropping turn from Michael Keaton, along with some of the best cinematography I've seen in years. If there is one film to see during the Awards season, it is Birdman.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Entertaining and Enthralling,"I saw the preview for this a few months ago and I must say that all I could think was, ""This looks weird."" After seeing it last night at the NY Film Festival (as the closing film of this year's festival), I came out more than pleasantly surprised. I don't know what type of film the preview was trying to make ""Birdman"" seem like, but it's not anything like I thought it would be.Inarritu, the editors, and the cinematographers incorporate a style of editing which would have been impressive without any plot whatsoever. It kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time, almost to a fault. It's almost exhausting having to keep up with it all. The score by Sanchez is bare but works great for the film, and is aided by a few visual representations mixed in throughout. The cast is more than up to the challenge as well, especially Keaton and Norton who have a few scenes where they each get to flex their acting chops. The rest of the cast doesn't seem to get as much of a chance to show off, but does not make their performances any less impressive. Awards for the four mentioned by name here could be forthcoming.An entertaining film well worth the price of admission. Don't let the strange preview fool you.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Nice counterbalance/complaint against the superhero movies,"This movie is widely criticized here because of its supposed lack of story. Indeed, if you've got your head stuck in the a** of the superhero movies and cellphone culture that Iñarritu is vehemently complaining against with this movie, it's got a definite lack of action. But, if you can appreciate a bit more subtlety and have some patience, can tie up some of the loose ends by yourself instead of having everything spelled out for you, then you'll see this movie is a nice little puzzle. It shows an actor that is depressed, passed his high days, going insane- some of the scenes really blur the line between reality and the main character's imagination. Definitely not an easy watch, but both the story, camera-work and acting have been worked out in detail really well- however none provide the viewer with everything on a silver platter. Watch if you're in a mood to think, not if you want an easy cheesy comedy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Effort for technical originality and a couple of strong performances aren't enough.,"There are many ways to make your movie different from the others and one of them is by attempting an achievement in the technical department. The director of Birdman made the conscious choice to shoot his whole movie like it is one continuous long take (with an exception near the end).Well, stunts like that sometimes work, sometimes don't, and in my opinion Birdman is closer to the latter.It should be better, in my opinion, if it was filmed in a more traditional way. It might not had the spotlight as a technical achievement but I think it would be far more efficient and far more entertaining. The director tied his own hands. He deprived some pretty powerful creative tools, in an effort to be different.The plot is OK. A delusional, washed-up Hollywood actor famous for playing a superhero (Birdman) in blockbuster movies decades earlier, tries his luck as a performer and a director on a Broadway theater. The other characters in the film his colleagues, his ex-wife, his daughter, are more like secondary characters who serve his story, without actually complete a sub-plot on their own.Michael Keaton is OK too. I hear about an Oscar nomination (he got a Golden Globe already). Well, people have won Oscars for less.The film is actual a dramedy, and there is a really funny scene outside of the theater (that the film mostly takes place), which might actually reward you if till that time you thought the film was boring.So. Is it worth watching? Hm, yes. Why not.Is it a ""masterpiece"" like I'm reading from some hasty or biased fans? Well No. Far from it. I use the ""M""-word (as someone said it) for movies like ""Amadeus (1984)"" and above.You probably won't remember ""Birdman"" next year.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
A treat for everyone that enjoys cinema,"There are very few times when I can actually say a movie has completely surpassed my expectations. It is sad but commercial cinema rarely takes chances anymore and art films are now usually more into the experimental and shock factor than actually trying to innovate a way to tell a story. Birdman does all of this and more.I have to confess I had lost faith in Iñarritu and I usually find his movies hard to watch, they are dark and quite depressing and leave me with a sense of despair. Im not saying this is bad just that it makes his movies too dense for my taste.That is why Birdman was such a surprise: Iñarritu has completely reinvented himself and the kind of stories he usually tells, in turn giving us a trip into the creation of an artist and the struggle with exposing such creation to the world.The acting is superb an intimate, created by his almost perfect planning of each scene.On the other side, Lubezki... Chivo always surprises me with his cinematography and each movie made by his hand is like rediscovering cinema. Every shot is beautifully shot and planned, sometimes to the point where you are left wondering how he can possibly do it. He is a genius and I feel privileged to be able to enter his mind if even for a couple of hours.All in all Birdman is astounding to watch and a movie that MUST be seen in cinema if only to appreciate the art of its film-making even more.If you think all this talk about art and technique makes Birdman a bore to watch you would be wrong. The movie is fun and witty and heart-wrenching and special. Frankly the best I have seen in years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
A film directing its arrow for prize,"A film shot by Inarritu with the obvious aim of a technical achievement and concern for prize.Here is a fine point that hits you in his other films, but you can't explain it with words, it doesn't go through in the movie, it stays in you after the movie ends, you have such a sincere feeling inside you. However, all the messages are pur in the words by the characters, too obviusly. They as well seem so numb and shallow characters, as if in a glass cage, so distant.Praise yes, ok, fine. Yet there is no cinematic masterpiece here that deserves such ""exaggerated"" praise, because there is nothing ""unique"" with this movie.It would be unfair to criticize the film on technical aspects, but it should not be exaggerated either.

Not quite fully-fledged Birdman,"Positioning himself on a meta-level just above the business and the times he is commenting on, Alejandro Iñárritu gives us an askew look at the flip side of show-business in general and movie-stardom in particular. His look takes the format of black comedy, but is more black than comedy, really, as we get to know one Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton), once one of Hollywood's biggest box-office stars as the superhero Birdman, now down on his luck both domestically (divorced) and professionally - having possibly bitten off more than he can chew by trying to write, produce and star in his first ever Broadway play. The echoes to real-life Keaton are almost painfully obvious at first sight, but never feel true in a deeper sense. In other words, we never feel that Keaton is risking much - something his character deems as the number one virtue. That being said, Keaton plunges himself into his first leading-role in six years with full conviction, but he's quickly on his own against the elements: Iñárritu's fancy camerawork and the shallowness of the script.Now, one could claim that this shallowness reflects the business and the world around it, which may be a fair point. But if so, the satire, which is valid and at times biting, should have made more of an impact. The film wants to give the impression that it's offering a reality-check for actors and audiences alike, but it's a flippant, elementary reality-check which eludes every possibility to go into depth. Instead we're often left with simple dichotomies such as critical acclaim vs fame, art vs entertainment, age vs youth. And even though Iñárritu has some interesting observations, he has already said everything he has to say when he's got half-an-hour left of his film.And so we're left with the moving, continuous camerawork, which is technically amazing and quite often artistically effective. What it probably also does, however, is cripple the performances, all of which feel stiffer and more mechanical than they should. There's great talent at work here, but much like Riggan Thomson himself, Birdman has a hard time convincing everyone that it's fully-fledged.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
BIRDMAN,"Directed by Alejandro G. Iñárritu, Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) tells about a washed-up actor Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) famous for his role as superhero Birdman, who struggles to mount a Broadway adaptation of a short story by Raymond Carver in the hope to revive his career.It's a black comedy movie from a great original screenplay written by Iñárritu, Nicolás Giacobone, Alexander Dinelaris, and Armando Bo. The story mostly centered around Thomson struggling with the whisper of his past role who always criticize him, which is a manifestation of his fear and self-doubt in a form of Birdman. It is also a satire of the current state of Hollywood itself, where superhero movies are booming.My favorite aspect of this movie is they managed to make this as if it was shot in a single continuous take, which is perfect for the theme of the movie.

"Laudable, yet somewhat too familiar and self-important","Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton), an aging movie star best known for his role as the superhero Birdman, tries to restart his career with a Broadway adaptation of Raymond Carver's ""What we talk about when we talk about love"". Story-wise, there isn't much novelty, but where the movie most excels is in the narrative medium: the (illusory) single shot, which is intertwined with the stylistic choice of presenting real events and Thomson's thoughts (or hallucinations) in a continuum. There are some clichés, such as Thomson's relationship with his daughter (Emma Stone) or the character of critic Tabitha Dickinson (Linsday Duncan), but the movie puts an original enough spin on them.The performances are generally pretty good, with Edward Norton standing out as self-absorbed method actor Mike Shiner. Nevertheless, the movie suffers from the same general sense of self-importance that characterises Shiner: while rightfully antagonising the world of mindless action movies and that of obnoxious and self-righteous critics, it somewhat too explicitly presents itself as what ""real"" cinematic art should look like.Still, the result is mostly entertaining and quite thought-provoking, resulting in a wholly satisfying picture.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

At what point does the actor as artist stop dishing out garbage to earn a buck? How is one supposed to make sense out of their life when they believe they are a sell out?

One can empathize with Riggan's plight as his self-doubt more and more conflicts with his need to achieve something worthwhile. Can he do it?

A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: The Expected Virtue of Unrestrained Brilliance,"Alejandro González Iñárritu's Oscar nominated film Birdman, aka The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance, is a departure from the contemporary style of filmmaking. Iñárritu uses a technique that gives an illusion as if the entire film were shot in a single extended take. Birdman's strong albeit bizarre dialogue and impeccable slapstick timing on one hand hark back to the works of the American screenwriter and playwright David Mamet, particularly Glengarry Glen Ross, while on the other, it strongly reminds of the films like Barton Fink and The Player in that it deglamorizes Hollywood while exposing its hypocrisies.The movie tells the story of a washed up Hollywood actor—once famous for playing an iconic superhero called ""Birdman""—as he battles both his inner demons and outer enemies in a desperate attempt to reinvent himself as a Broadway director by staging a new adaptation of a Raymond Carver short story called ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"".Birdman offers a nice blend of realism, surrealism and magic realism. Vintage Iñárritu, Birdman doesn't feed any definitive answers but rather allows the viewers to engage at their own intellectual planes. While the entire cast puts up a brilliant show, Michael Keaton and Edward Norton deserve special mention for their sublime performances. For Norton, Birdman marks a return to form. As to Keaton, he delivers a performance so emphatic and complete that it can be easily described as the performance of the decade. One wonders what kept him from unleashing himself on the celluloid all these years.

A too ambitious movie,"That it does not come up that ambition. First of all the main character is rather uncongenial, a truculent and arrogant man who hostilizes almost everybody often without reason. The story is an acceptable one but not particularly moving or dramatic: an actor who was famous for his role of a comic book character and that now ends his career by trying to put a play on a Broadway theatre stage. In doing this he meets a few obstacles such as a bad relationship with another actor and some unfavourable newspaper critiques. And personally he has got a conflict with his daughter. All this is rather ordinary in human terms. Besides that he seems to confuse himself with Birdman his former character that has made him famous, hearing and listening to his voice. This is a bit inadequate. The movie is nevertheless rather good in technical cinematographic terms.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Total disappointment,"I am someone who really likes watching movies and I don't mind watching a bad movie once in a while but this movie just beat everything. I was so hyped for this movie when I read what is was about and when I saw the cast, but thank god my friend bought it before me, now I don't have to spend any money on it. It's kinda sad actually, I had such good hopes and then as I watched the movie I got more and more disappointed. There is no tension, no good quotes, no action, it is very predictable and to be honest without so many star actors this movie would suck even more. The actors themselves played good but the movie as a whole is just a disaster. I don't get why this is being nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. The whole time you wait for something exciting to happen and when it does they don't even do it properly. I mean after one hour you get just annoyed of the main character, he's so insecure and when you think he finally got himself together he screws it up again. Well, I guess bad movies have to be made, too ;)",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
All in one shot,"Birdman's cinematic gimmick is that the entire movie is seemingly shot in one continuous camera take, no cuts, no edits. In the tradition of the masterpieces ""Russian Ark"", ""PVC-1"" and Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rope"" (which actually had 9 or 10 necessary cuts, due to the limitations of film cameras), likewise here we watch a story seemingly in real-time as if we were invisible observers orbiting the drama. The art of the ""long take"" is a risky gamble because it involves a lot of extra choreography, production, lighting and attention to detail, and most viewers hardly notice. But it's one of the most impressive things that can be done with a camera.Note: the entire film wasn't actually done in 1 take like the aforementioned movies, but through the use of tasteful cgi edits it's close enough.If that little introductory factoid bored you, then you'll probably be bored by the flick. Yes, this is an ""artsy"" film, but it doesn't lose itself in artsiness like, say, one of those movies that force you to read subtitles (/sarcasm). Through the use of quirky humor, an interesting story, and of course Michael Keaton's excellent portrayal of a complex lovable loser, there's enough to keep your attention as long as you're not expecting an action flick.""Birdman"" is about an aging moviestar named Riggan who once played an iconic superhero named Birdman, but now having matured, he is intent on leaving the world a legacy of more than pop culture in tights. He self-produces a stage play, investing his entire fortune, as well as the greater part of his sanity, in it, hoping that the insane actors he hired don't destroy his entire vision.Oh by the way, Riggan may have a few super powers.The plot itself is a mouthful, but the power of this film lies not in the plot but in the tense human drama that unfolds as we explore themes of dysfunctional family relationships (particularly with his Meh-lennial daughter, excellently played by Emma Stone), arrogance in the art world, and of course the tragedy of not being taken seriously just because you wore blue tights for half your career.The gimmick of the continuous camera as well as excellent overall cinematography and staging, is the icing on the cake. I can see how Birdman easily swooped up the Academy Award for cinematography in 2017 (along with Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay).I can also understand why some people hated this movie. It's not an easily digestible entertainment flick, and it is NOT a superhero movie despite it featuring ex-Batman himself in the role of ""Birdman"", so don't expect fight scenes and flying (well not too much flying. And the fight scene was a riot). If you enjoy heavy dramatic works where not a lot happens, yet we are given a peek into the deepest recesses of the human soul (Streetcar Named Desire, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, or any classic stage-to-film adaptation), then this will be right up your alley.I would compare Birdman to films like ""De-Lovely"" (a stylish biopic of Cole Porter), ""Klimt"" (featuring John Malkovich as the famous Austrian painter), or on the lighter side, a great dysfunctional-superhero gem called ""Special"" with Michael Rapaport playing the role of a lonely metermaid who suddenly develops super powers but still can't get his life together.""Birdman"" definitely soars above the flock of common Hollywood flicks. If you're not sure, I think you should go ahead and wing it. Just be aware that Birdman isn't exactly a crowd pleaser. Er... crow pleaser? Either way I think you'll beak content with time well spent. Ok, I'll stop now.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"""Popularity is the slutty little cousin of prestige.""","If you're a fan of dialog-driven ""tour-de-force"" ensemble acting movies then ""Birdman"" is for you. Besides the great cast and script, the real star of the film is the D.P. Emmanuel Lubezki. He weaves technical magic with the camera and in the editing room; about 100 of the movie's 119 minutes are made to look like one almost seamless take, with no cuts. The single-camera, extended tracking-shot style pioneered by Hitchcock and refined by Kubrick, Orson Welles, Scorsese and a few other directors, is taken to a whole new level here. Even with the crisp, snappy non-stop dialog, some camera tricks took me out of the story just long enough for me to wonder how in hell it was achieved. I'm sure Academy Award nominations are in store for the cinematography and editing as well as for director Alejandro Iñárritu.Michael Keaton has been given the definitive role of his career, and he puts the opportunity to good use. The supporting ensemble cast is also great; it's obvious everybody sank their teeth into their roles with abandon. The level of intensity is on a par with ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" - the groundbreaking 1966 movie about four people having emotional meltdowns. In this story, it's Keaton's central character who's losing his grip on reality, and the audience is along for the ride on a hot rail to Hell.There is a lot of wit and humor to balance out the pathos though - it's not an unrelenting downer by any stretch. And the final scene is ambiguous enough to allow the viewer to decide for him/herself if it's tragic or joyous. I thought that was a nice touch.A few caveats: Edward Norton's self-centered asshole actor character is a bit one-dimensional, occasionally over-the-top, but always interesting, if not a scene-stealer. A few parts of the script are predictable (I was anticipating some lines of dialog before they were spoken), and the story premise itself isn't original, but has had variations done many times before (a middle- aged former superstar actor/athlete/lawyer/criminal who's fallen on hard times goes for one last shot at redemption in a winner-takes- all gamble). Having said that, the combined talents in this endeavour manage to put together an extraordinary work of art, flaws and all, and for those who are tired of Hollywood drivel with caped crusaders and CGI explosions, this is the right antidote.

This isn't a film for the meagre minds who expect to clap their cymbals in harmony with some of the drivel that are shown on today's silver screen. If it is your heart felt opinion that The Avengers deserves an Oscar, then don't bother watching this film.Birdman is a heavily nuanced yet eloquent visual art form. It is different. And it requires the audience to flow with the unconventional rhythm of the film rather than expect rigid logic and conventional storytelling. We are allowed to explore the character's purlieu while empathising with his inner mediocrity. It aims to express the level of malaise one experiences when he fails to achieve what he feels he deserves.

One of the Best Films of All Time,"Birdman is a powerhouse of cinema. Throwing away the commentary on critics and the movie industry and artistic integrity; it's still a live, thriving beast that has so much unpredictability in every scene. It has raw, powerful, career-defining performances, ridiculously impressive camera-work, surrealistic cinematography and an always involving story that gives the film ground even with it's surrealistic moments (something the Tree of Life lacked a bit). You can just feel the energy, the tension, and the off-beat score drum score is impeccable. Anyway that's all I have to say about Birdman. It's my 2nd favourite film of all time (after Synecdoche, New York) and the only problem with this film is that it's too big, too alive to watch on a normal television screen. Honestly, it's not Gravity, Avatar or even Intestellar. This is the definitive cinema experience. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

"""Birdman (Or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)"" asks brilliant questions, teaches fantastic lessons and brings a new style of cinema to the fore.","""Birdman (Or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)"" is a simply excellent film. Why? There is a scene in ""Birdman"" where Riggan Thompson (played by Michael Keaton), who is trying to direct and star in his Broadway adaptation of the Raymond Carver play ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"", walks towards the front of the stage and talks about love, what it is to be loved, and how we all crave that. But is it love we crave? Or, as Sam (played by Emma Stone) puts it, is Riggan confusing love with admiration? These are some of the many wide-ranging questions that ""Birdman"" leaves you with as you leave the cinema and you thus don't really realise how good the cast, direction, dialogue and score are until you've given up on those questions, realising that they are just too difficult to answer.The cast is simply stellar in ""Birdman"", brilliantly led by Michael Keaton in what Variety's Peter Debruge calls the ""comeback of the century"" and which I agree with him over. However, I'm not sure if Michael Keaton would accept this title, in a recent interview promoting the film he laughed at the concept, yet the comparisons between his career and that of Riggans are unavoidable, he also laughed when this was bought up too. But, to be fair, all I knew of Michael Keaton before I saw ""Birdman"" was that he had starred in the 1989 ""Batman"" film as well as in its 1992 sequel ""Batman Returns"". His career hasn't been stellar and it's a surprise I even knew his name before I saw ""Birdman"" really But his performance in this film deserves all the attention he gets and all the awards he is being nominated for. Riggan is a complex character and you are never quite sure about him, how he feeling and how he feels towards others, not only because of how Riggan changes as the film goes on but also because of how that reflects the ever-changing nature of the film, moving from one question or theme to the other without actually leaving it behind, instead leaving it in the back of your mind for you to think about later.Again, as I said earlier, the rest of the cast is great too. Edward Norton is brilliant (playing the self-obsessed, ego-driven actor who feels more real on the stage than off it, Mike Shiner). But then Miles is so much more than that and again it's hard to put your finger on what or who he is and what he is looking for. Zach Galifanakis (playing Riggan's agent, Jake) who is trying to keep Riggan grounded, is also brilliant and then so is Emma Stone and Naomi Watts (although both seem to be in very familiar roles). I could go on listing actors and actresses but it would just be a paragraph of names. (Last one I promise but Amy Ryan also does well playing Riggan's ex-wife Slyvia.)But each of these is alleviated, and should thanking him in any of their Oscars speeches, by the film's director, Alejandro González Iñárritu. Alejandro hasn't done many English-Language films before (except Babel in 2006 and 21 Grams in 2003), and considering that, it makes his direction in ""Birdman"" even more outstanding. Where he really excels is in how ""Birdman"" is seemingly filmed in one take. These really emphasise how good the acting is in this film, be it a monologue by Emma Stone as she rants at her dad, a take that involves Michael Keaton walking in just his underpants through Times Square, or a scene where Keaton and Edward Norton rehearse on stage. What makes these one takes even better is how the film is almost entirely set in St. James Theatre and you really get a feel for it as you glide around it in these one takes, feeling, seeing and hearing everything that is going on. It truly is an experience. I loved every moment of it and what this ultimately did for me was make me feel like I was part of the production, as if I was being given this behind the scenes look at what was going on. This thrill inspired me to get back into acting, something that I used to do a lot of. What happens with this you as the film goes on, you begin to realise that this is less of a trip to the cinema and more of a trip to the theatre. It's a good mix of both and I can't really imagine it being the same on DVD, although it never is. I will definitely be seeing it again.Birdman's dialogue is great too and it matches the fast-paced score of ""Birdman"". Both reflect how unique ""Birdman"" is and that is where its brilliance lies. Just like how when you are in a production and the curtains come down on closing night you come to think that you really did not want that to end, and I had the same feeling when ""Birdman"" did. Its cast, score and direction are all what will be directly nominated come the Oscars, but there is no specific award for the questions ""Birdman"" made me think about, the way ""Birdman"" made me feel and the lessons ""Birdman"" taught me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

Seriously?,"I am forced to respect that many people disagree with me about this movie and that is is receiving all kinds of awards. However, seeing this film was a truly dreadful experience. I give it two time peeks, a personal rating system. It simply means if I check my watch twice during the film, I am not entertained and want to go home. In what I hoped would be the climactic scene, the main character jumps to what I was breathlessly hoping would be his immediate death, thereby bringing the film to a close. Sadly, no, he lives. Let's see: a man gets locked out of the theater in his underwear and has to go through a crowd to get back in. A man levitates for no apparent reason and a pretentious actor intentionally destroys a live performance out of ego and sheer disdain for that night's audience. And a bunch of people who think they too are the center of the universe occupy a screen that they have no business paying to get in to see. If this is the best thing Hollywood produces for its awards shows, then Armageddon is surely upon us. I once liked the lead actors in this film, but that have managed to outlive their careers. Next time hopefully they will succeed at that one thing-jumping from a roof. Gravity deserves to be taken seriously.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"An ""Actor's"" Movie","BIRDMAN is an interesting ""actors"" movie that, I'm sure, appealed to the performers that agreed to appear in it. Unfortunately, I'm not too sure that this movie is appealing to much more of a population than that.Michael Keaton plays Riggan Thomas, a former star of blockbuster comic-book movies who is trying to make a comeback as a ""real"" actor by writing, directing and starring in his Broadway debut. He struggles throughout the movie with his own identity. Is he an ""actor"" as he likes to think he is, or is he ""just a celebrity"" as someone tells him - and does it matter? Ultimately, the last question is what this movie tries to tell us.The ""gimmick"" of this movie is that it is filmed in one, long shot. (It isn't really, but it attempts to give us the illusion that it is). We follow Thomas and others throughout the St. James Theatre on Broadway and places very close to there (close enough to walk to). It's an interesting way of telling this tale, not one that I think helps the story along, and since I was aware of the ""gimmick"" throughout the movie, it might have hurt it.I have heard Oscar buzz for Keaton's performance, and I just don't see it. True, it is GREAT to see Keaton back in a leading role and he acquits himself just fine, but it just isn't an ""Academy Award worthy"" performance or role (IMH0).Because of the ""inside"" nature of this movie, I stated earlier that this would be appealing to actors and, I am sure, that is what drew such strong performers as Edward Norton, Emma Stone, Naomi Watts and Andrea Riseborough. They all served the script and the gimmick well with strong performances. Only Zach Galifinakis' agent, Jake, falls short for me. He just isn't in the same league as a dramatic actor with these others. It's fun to see him try, but he falls short, resorting to over-acting at times.Director and Writer Alejandro Gonazlez Inarritu creates an interesting world, but I wanted him to flesh out the supporting characters more and rely on the gimmick less.if he did, I might have cared a little more at the end as to what happens to Keaton's character. But, as it is, I didn't.6 (out of 10) stars. And you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

Skirts around some important issues,"""For what else is the life of man but a kind of play in which men in various costumes perform until the director motions them offstage?"" – ErasmusOnce you add up the upcoming films from Marvel and DC studios, there are twenty two ""superhero"" films being planned over the course of the next four years. Though decried for their paucity of artistic merit, what is often overlooked is that these films, with their depiction of a magic pretty much gone from some of our lives, are not only popular because of their enhanced action scenes but fill a void in the current paradigm saturated by materialistic culture that does not recognize our personal power. Of course, for those who feel their acting talents might be better utilized, these films are not their friend.Case in point, Riggan Thompson (Michael Keaton) whose career in Hollywood took off with his role in the superhero film Birdman, the title of the new movie by Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu (Biutiful). Though he has played other roles since then, the only one that prompts requests for his autograph is Birdman. Frustrated with how his career has become sidetracked, Riggan has turned to Broadway for redemption. Now middle-aged, Riggan attempts to resurrect his career as an actor by writing, directing, and starring in an adaptation for the stage of Raymond Carver's What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.Shot by cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki inside and around the landmark St. James Theater in New York City close to Times Square, the film follows Riggan's frenetic attempts to put the show together despite overweening self doubts and a roller coaster relationship with the cast and crew, especially his co-star Lesley (Naomi Watts) and girl friend Laura (Andrea Riseborough). Also in the picture is Riggan's daughter Sam (Emma Stone), a production assistant who has recently been released from rehab.Still resentful of her dad's absence during her formative years, Sam is very critical of his refusal to use social media as a means of promotion. ""You don't even have a Facebook page,"" she says. It's like you don't even exist."" Inarritu creates a frenetic pace with long shots following different actors, while weaving in episodes of magic realism that include scenes of flying and the costumed Birdman, aka his conscience, following him with advice about making another superhero movie. ""Those people don't know what you are capable of,"" he says.When one of the primary actors is hurt during rehearsals, he is replaced by the volatile Mike Shiner (Edward Norton) who gets into disputes with Riggan about how each scene should be performed while blatantly pursuing Riggan's daughter, though he tells her he can only perform on stage but is impotent off the set. The three preview performances do not go well and a meeting in the bar with the highly critical New York Times theater critic (Lindsay Duncan) who rails against actors and threatens to ""kill the play"" leaves him in a state of despair, underscored by his encounter with a street actor shouting the Shakespearean lines from Macbeth about how ""tomorrow and tomorrow creeps in this petty pace from day to day.""Aside from his lawyer and best friend Jake (Zach Galifianakis), Riggan's main anchor seems to be his ex-wife Sylvia (Amy Ryan) who provides him with the ego boost he so desperately needs. In its attempt to create a satire reaching for wit and originality, Birdman touches on but mostly skirts around several different themes: the inability of an aging actor to adjust to a changing environment, the nature of our true identity beyond the roles we play in life, the art versus entertainment conundrum, and the inordinate worship of celebrities in contemporary culture.Unfortunately, despite an Oscar-worthy performance by Michael Keaton in a welcome return to the screen and the film's engaging moments of true energy, the film does not pause long enough between the drumbeat of a jazzy score by Antonio Sanchez, the lugubrious strings of Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony, its pseudo-profound spirituality and juvenile humor to say anything meaningful about any of these subjects.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

The main character, Riggan Thomson, is so well developed and sympathetic that the plot of the film can become somewhat philosophical and even depressive at some point, but always seeks to make the audience sympathize with the protagonist's feelings on a roller coaster of, mostly negative, emotions, as you put together the pieces from the plot of this bold feature film. The only thing I could criticize about Birdman is that in the second half it mainly focuses on Riggan Thompson, of course he is the main character, so that's not a surprise, but other characters that seemed important at the beginning and also have a good background plot practically disappear in this part giving the sensation that some closure was missing, like his daughter Sam (Emma Stone), a former drug addict living with the same man that abandoned her many years ago, or Mike Shiner (Edward Norton) the douchebag experienced Broadway method actor who gets so involved into his role that he sometimes does not seem to be able to distinguish the thin line between reality and fiction.

"""Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)"" (2014) - Film Review (10/10)","*GREAT MOVIE* Mike Shiner: Popularity is the slutty little cousin of prestige.There's drums, ""Birdman"" stomps across the screen. There's a quick flash of a beach with jellyfish, a meteor plummeting to Earth, then there's Michael Keaton; floating in mid-air Indian style. After these first few minutes of Alejandro G. Inarritu's ""Birdman"" went by, so many thoughts flew through my brain that I started to smile trying to figure things out. Without doing much, ""Birdman"" gives you a lot to think about just in the first couple of minutes. What does this mean? Why did this happen? How bizarre, how strange, how weird, how curious, how unbelievably intriguing? After Keaton leaves his dressing room, the camera follows him, and doesn't stop. It moves to other people, follows their lives, their thoughts, then comes back. I cannot get over how innovative and intriguing this film is. Along with this brilliant camera-work, the film has a fantastic script; sharp, funny, and even satirical. I smiled the whole time while watching this film.""Birdman"" is the story of a man who used to play an iconic superhero in the movies, who's now haunted by these memories in his own mind, who tries to make it on Broadway. The movie is a trip through the lives of our main character, Riggan (the guy who played Birdman) and the others surrounding him. It reminded me of a Tarantino movie in a way, because of the level of ambition in the script, and the long, but masterful, meaningful scenes.""Birdman"" is the best film of the year. It stands out, it's on a completely different level of filmmaking.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Dazzling Satire,"Birdman pictures how celebrities deal with the mid-life of their careers, as they often try to win back their glory days, but struggles with their personal demons. The movie centers a man who is haunted by his past and seeking to transcend himself to a project where he can be respected. It is presented in one very long take on how he works in this particular stage play, while also being challenged by his personal life issues and his superhero role, as a pigment of his imagination, discouraging that he will never be as good as he was. Birdman is best described as magnificent, easily by its craft and terrific performances. It insanely presents this thespian's attempt of redemption and the conflict of cultural changes. It is often meant to be comical, but there's a strange value to that.The movie doesn't always take itself seriously. Other than having a fantasy of being tormented by his iconic superhero role, the story often makes a joke about the industry, how today's view to true art is hardly valuable, and attention towards worn out careers gains better in controversies. It just keeps pushing the harshness to the main character until he completely lose his mind. This is a total satire, but the big picture here is Riggan's ego, the movie often explores that and his psychosis, and how it is messing with his career and his show. People would wonder why most of their conversations have to be too broad in drama and comedy, but then, this is about poking fun at this generation of fame, which is either meant to display humorous or awkwardly tragic.The characters are excellently defined, although they're pretty much the most bitter and weirdest people you'd encounter on screen, but it's still entertaining when they attack each other by their words that can either be reasonable or not. It's the actors that brought the utter pizazz. This film might as well be for Michael Keaton, the actor's talent has been taken for granted lately and it takes for a prestige project like this to remember what he could actually deliver as an actor. Keaton lends a real character, making Riggan's constant insanity feel truly substantial than plain ridiculous, yet the emotions stay real when the scenario shifts to seriousness. The supporting cast is splendid as well, with Edward Norton brilliantly delivers something memorable out of his obnoxious method actor character. And Emma Stone surprises, especially in one scene where you can leave yourself nearly breathless.For its filmmaking alone, the movie is sensational. Sure, the single, nearly endless take has been done by several movies before, but nothing goes this far like Birdman. But not only the camera-work that has gone beyond limits, the cinematography brings life and makes stunning shots in every angle. The movie just shoots these things like it's unimaginable, of course there are tricks to cover up the interconnected cuts, but it never matters since it already overwhelms by how it keeps it moving, from doors to hallways.The film ends with a mystery, but we can easily see what all of that means. Birdman is just one grand satire that explains how difficult to appeal the modern audience if you belong in a different era of the industry when you were better. The movie embraces the whole ridicule, but the real impact belongs to its technical achievement, as it perfectly reflects what's going on, turning things into larger-than- life. It may get too crazy, but there's no exception how extremely entertaining the experience is.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
A movie not about superheroes. A movie about life and fighting your dreams.,"Before seeing the movie I'd watched all of Keaton's interviews about it on YouTube and I have to say I saw an actor pleased with his part and acting. It wasn't just about the nominations and prizes. It was about doing something meaningful.I liked the idea of actually fighting our dreams and figuring out our own way of doing things, and how our lives are all beset by regret and lack of support until we actually come to peace with ourselves.Keaton's performance is amazing and he took the role at the right moment. He was a favorite when I was young and watching Batman and now, after I grew older, he is still there not the comedian, not the superhero, but the person on screen I can relate to.If you like superhero movies and CGI then don't watch it. This movie is not a part of the Avengers franchise and will never be. It's never coming down to that level.Enjoy it, cry if you need to, laugh if you can but you will find yourself at some point.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"Fascinating, maddening, a soaring experience","The hype and acclaim for this was huge, and yet somehow the film still managed to surprise. I don't have a lot of time to give more detailed thoughts like I did Whiplash yesterday, but it's safe to say I agree with the board in its admiration and intense love for both. Unlike Whiplash though, this was a different sort of experience, definitely one I had to get used to. The film's ""one take"" structure really does sort of push the film into the audience, to fully take the characters in and at times be overwhelming. It took me about 30 minutes to be fully immersed in it, but when I did, it functioned as a character drama in such extraordinary ways, and in ways that really hit me afterwards. By the time it was over, I was ready to watch it again, it's one of those films... I also want to say that it feels like such an instant classic. I don't think any recent film in years has felt this way, but this really does. I'm also surprised by how it's one of the two front-runners for awards, I wouldn't have thought as many people would be as open to it but I'm so glad. The ensemble is amazing, with Norton and Keaton being among the best of the year. I actually think that it's such a shame that both Simmons and Norton came out the same year because both would've made more-than-worthy winners. Seeing both Whiplash and this in the span of 24 hours is just, too much to contain. Too much greatness, I feel like I can't take it",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

Who Cares?,"I had to watch this movie because of all the hype and nominations and just couldn't wait to see something that looked interesting.Don't get caught up by my rating though, I will say there are some nice things about this movie. Firstly, the acting was really great. Keaton and the other actors had very realistic emotions and acting. They are truly believable actors. Keaton, a washed up actor who played a fictional movie hero ""Birdman,"" tries to evolve from an action packed star into art and theater, trying to find true emotion and symbolism. He puts everything into directing this play including ignoring his already distant family and giving up everything he owns to pay for its production. The viewer sees as the movie progresses that the main actor is slowly losing his grip in reality. As opening day comes he realizes more and more, how more impossible his dream is becoming. This is where the viewer must focus on the mood, the thoughts, and even the meaning of the background sounds/tunes. What do these mean? And how should you apply them to the ending?Was it artistic? Yes, it was very artistic and interesting. However, the plot just seemed so boring. I applaud anyone who went through the first 20 minutes and still had patience. The plot really isn't anything new. Keaton plays a dad who made it big and lost sight of the things that mattered like his family and true loved ones. Alright, alright, same story played differently. I know the play was supposed to look mediocre, but just the added screen time devoted to showing it made the movie even more boring. Seeing these parts over and over again. The movie is simply a dead beat washed up father who stubbornly chooses to go down with the ship. Some movies you just know whats going to happen and you hate those, well... this one is kind of the opposite but its kind of dreadful.The artistic aspect was alright. Its not something we haven't seen before like Shutter Island, Inception, or other films where you really have to pay attention and figure out what the real ending implies. After, you go wow, that was interesting, and then look back at the plot, I really don't understand how you go, wow! Awesome movie! Its more like... so what? It was good acting, but I didn't feel any connection to the characters. Who cares?I'd watch it again in passing but wouldn't pay attention much. Movie is quite slow and at times obnoxious. Art in movies is awesome, but it is completely lacking in the passion of the viewer towards the characters and the plot.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
What really makes us happy?,"It's not very often a film is made and it it hits you almost too close to home. I myself am an actor. I perform in theatre and aspire to work in film, not because of the glitz and glam, but because I am truthfully and honestly passionate about my craft.Rigger Thompson, a man who once graced cinema screens as the hero 'Birdman.' After he found the franchise being less an artistic venture, and more so a gimmick, he left. Leaving a 20 year gap where he has never been able to toss the cape and cowl and simply be an actor. This film weighs heavy on what does it mean to be appreciated? and if so, does it make you happy?First and foremost, Michael Keaton comes forth with a career defining performance. A performance layered with heartbreaking desperation, pent up angst, and unbridled passion. His cynical yet honest view on the world around him can't help but be admired. With his ball busting manager/best friend, his admittedly kooky girlfriend (who is easily at least 15 years younger than him), his distant daughter, and his co-star Edward Norton who is so committed to the theatre that he himself almost can't operate in everyday life. All of these views on life, and the society we live in spiral in front of Riggan like a non-stop vortex of emotion where he begins to doubt himself to a point where schizophrenia takes over.The supporting cast is absolutely top notch as they do not miss a beat. Emma Stone's heartbreaking monologue as she tries to get her father to open his eyes and face the facts left me speechless. Edward Norton who, in my opinion really shows us what he can do in this film utterly full of himself, but not out of want and need for acceptance, but out of this idea he has crafted for himself. Stage actors live life, where film actors play life. His performance is highly political, and I can't help but agree with most of what he says. Zach Galifianakis does a wonderful job of playing Riggans manager and best friend. Whether or not you agree he is looking out for his friend is u to you, but his want and need for Riggan's success is almost a catalyst for disaster. With that Zach isn't a bad guy, he's sincere, hard working and ultimately committed to his client.Visually, this film has done what few films even attempt to do. Using the 'one shot' technique where the whole film looks as if it is one seamlessly continuous shot is not only a brilliant piece of camera work, but also gives you the sensation of it unfolding right before your eyes in real life. Using the element of fast film in other pictures with jump cuts and time lapses you loose track of where you are, and what just happened. In this case the transitions are utterly seamless. It is a hoy to watch such beautiful pacing in a film. Something that has not been given the respect it truly deserves.Alejandro González Iñárritu has written, directed, and produced a film which hinges on life itself. He attacks actors, filmmakers, critics, journalist, Twitter, Facebook, the list goes on. He teaches us that success is not based in monetary value, but what you make of your life, and whether or not what you are doing in your life is truly making you happy.I am making a statement right now that Birdman is one of the greatest films ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Lost and Found: The Potential of Birdman,"With the movie ""Birdman,"" I tend to be asking myself while watching it, ""What's the point?"". I felt several ties throughout the film were lacking due to the style of the whole ""One take shot"" feel the movie was going for that drastically changed how the pacing of the movie felt. The film's substance and what it gave me felt a little bloated to me personally while compared to more traditionally made movies that I found myself enjoying more. I can tell why this movie could be entertaining to certain people, but it's just not for me. Everything I said as a fault is the only reason I didn't enjoy the film. The filmmaking and cinematography were great for what they could have been, even if they didn't use it to their most significant potential. I found myself very interested in almost every character in the film, with Edward Norton's character being a great highlight. I would recommend this film to anyone to show them how well shot and masterfully directed this is, and maybe they would enjoy the bits I didn't as well more than me.

"Highly skilled, challenging, and full of brains and heart","The film's technical merits are without exception. Most predominant is that the whole movie feels like one long sequence shot, from about minute 2 until nearly the end. There are disguised cuts, and the movie finds moments to settle down the camera to contrast the movement. But the orchestration of actors, the re-framing of the camera, and the support of crew outside the frame, are nothing short of phenomenal.The film's artistic merits are easy to see in the performances, design and composition, but harder to puzzle out emotionally/intellectually. They rely partly on multiple ambiguities, and the audience will need to do some broad-view thinking about life and art to really crack open the movie.

It has everything to entertain and challenge.,"""Popularity is the slutty little cousin of prestige."" Mike (Edward Norton)Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is important to see if only for Michael Keaton in the titular role, a has-been movie hero (Birdman) hoping to make a comeback as director, writer, and actor in his Broadway adaptation of a Raymond Carver short story. Keaton will be nominated for an Oscar; he's that good.The film is also a witty commentary on celebrity (as the above quote attests), its tragic consequences when success does not follow success. In addition, collegial relationships are explored during the high-strung rehearsal of gifted actors at the St. James Theater on Broadway, challenging each other in professional and personal ways.No fellow actor is tougher or brighter than Edward Norton as Mike, whose thespian gifts are generously displayed but who is sexually impotent off stage. When he works on stage with Keaton and Naomi Watts, the acting is better ensemble work than in any other film I can think of this year.Besides the stunning acting, the camera and editing are to be experienced: the careering camera visits dressing rooms, hallways, and stage without skipping a beat--the director is extending takes and cutting minimally, letting the camera do the work while scenes follow scenes seamlessly. The effect is the high-energy of creative people bursting the confines of narrow backstage to emerge in the seemingly endless space of the stage, an expanse waiting for the egos and talents to fill it.It's all about acting, and it is not always pretty:""I wish I had more self-respect."" Lesley (Naomi Watts) ""You're an actress."" Laura (Andrea Riseborough)However, it's Keaton's acting that dominates: edgy and impatient, on the lookout for the right nuance, diffident and dreaming--he's an artistic mess.

Birdman soars to new heights with masterful storytelling and powerful symbolism,"Alejandro González Iñárritu's ""Birdman"" is a tour de force in cinematic storytelling, using rich symbolism and stunning cinematography to create a captivating exploration of identity and the human condition. The film follows the story of Riggan Thomson, a former Hollywood star who is trying to revive his career by staging a Broadway play. As he grapples with his own inner demons and insecurities, he begins to blur the lines between reality and fantasy, leading to a climactic confrontation with his own sense of self.At the heart of ""Birdman"" is the concept of the superhero, both as a cultural icon and as a metaphor for our own struggles with identity and purpose. Through the character of Riggan and his alter-ego, the titular Birdman, the film examines the complex relationship between performance, authenticity, and the search for meaning. The use of long, unbroken takes and the illusion of a single-shot film lends a sense of immediacy and intensity to the story, as if we are watching the events unfold in real-time.One of the most striking elements of ""Birdman"" is the way in which it incorporates the idea of the theatre into its visual language. The film is shot in a way that constantly reminds us of the theatricality of the story, with characters moving through the corridors and backstage areas of the theatre as if they are part of a living, breathing organism. The use of stage lights, props, and costumes as visual motifs underscores the themes of performance and illusion that run throughout the film.The performances in ""Birdman"" are uniformly excellent, with Michael Keaton giving a career-defining turn as Riggan Thomson. The supporting cast, including Emma Stone, Edward Norton, and Naomi Watts, are equally impressive, imbuing their characters with a sense of depth and complexity that is rarely seen in mainstream cinema.Overall, ""Birdman"" is a bold and audacious film that pushes the boundaries of what cinema can be. It is a work of art that demands to be seen and savored, a testament to the power of storytelling and the human spirit. With its masterful use of symbolism, stunning visuals, and powerful performances, ""Birdman"" is a cinematic triumph that will stand the test of time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

A career defining performance from Keaton (and when we are talking about Keaton, that's saying a lot) and everyone else is also on top form throughout. What really blew my mind was how the film is (save a handful of transitions) one giant take. I cannot stress enough how much of a nightmare this must have been to make - noone can make a mistake, no scenes can be edited ot reshot, nothing can be cut. The director and crew had to be 100% certain of what they wanted before even rolling the camera. Imagine having the balls to even attempt this! That aside though, the plot and characters are interesting, the drum-led soundtrack morphs and follows the tone of the film perfectly - almost serving as a heartbeat or sorts... and the film is also visually stunning.

Birdman on a Wire,"Part backstage drama and part study of an actor having a nervous breakdown, (plus that awful alternative title in parentheses) you might be tempted to give this particular film a miss. Incredibly, there actually are super-hero sequences too in a movie which swings between imagination and reality, fantasy and the mundane at will, taking the viewer along with it in its wake. This latter is accomplished by the acting skills of the cast and in particular the free flowing directorial style with continuous camera work tracking the action wherever it goes, imperceptibly speeding up timelines and giving a fly-on-the-wall insight into the tawdry lives of a group of actors trying to break a play on Broadway.Central to it all is Michael Keaton, cunningly cast as an ex-movie star typecast from blockbuster movies he starred in twenty five years before as the super-hero Birdman, now trying to establish himself as a serious actor by adapting a Ray Carver short story into a play. Actually, said play looks absolutely awful but putting that to one side it's all about the characters' interaction, including his smart-aleck daughter who Keaton employs as his gopher, a maverick big-name big-headed actor who he recruits to boost the play's prospects, his plate-spinning manager desperate for the show to succeed as well as his former super-powered alter ego who makes Harvey-like appearances and utterances urging him to jettison the present.I liked the way off-beat humour kept puncturing the so-serious conversation pieces which elsewhere take up so much of the screen time, such as both Keaton and Edward Norton as superstar thespian Mike Shiner at different times caught in scenes unashamedly donning only their tighty-whiteys, Norton's character becoming aroused in a live bedroom scene and Keaton's final breakdown when he regresses completely into his super hero guise.The long-takes and relentlessly mobile camera work is wonderfully inventive and even though there is a sense that there's not really much of a story to tell here and occasionally style overtakes content. Keaton as Riggen Thompson plays the falling apart lead trying to pull himself and his play together. He demonstrates considerable range but like most of the parts here it is flashily written and screaming out for official recognition, which it duly got at the Oscars and more.I enjoyed the film and loved the depiction of New York's Broadway, especially as I've just returned from a first time visit to that very part of the Big Apple. I still have my suspicions as to whether the film will age well and really stands up in terms of content but no doubt actors and directors, budding and established will get a real kick out of it. Not being either, maybe I thought I occasionally saw instead the wires, smoke and mirrors propping it up.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
The pure definition of a masterpiece!,"To me Birdman wasn't just a film. It was an experience. This is truly one of the best films I've ever seen.Everything in this movie was done so perfectly that I couldn't find any flaw with it. Michael Keaton gives the best performance of his entire career and one that isn't just Oscarworthy but one that is ground-breaking and will be remembered for a long time. The rest of the cast also provided some extremely powerful performances. The movie is made to look like one continuous shot as if it were a play which solidified my judgement of Alejandro G. Iñárritu being one of the best filmmakers present. His direction brings a whole rawness to the story and characters that makes them believable.The cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is incredible. You feel like you're at Broadway witnessing this character driven drama and immerses you throughout the film. The story handles so many themes and ideas like Family, Hollywood, Critics and many more to a point where you feel worried whether the film can convey so much in a runtime of 2 hours but I can assure you everything is handled perfectly.Overall, this film is a MASTERPIECE! You won't see anything like Birdman and its commentary on Hollywood, Actors, Family and Critics is sure to make you think. I HIGHLY recommend this! This is what cinema is all about.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
As surreal as it is cinematically impressive,"Birdman is artistically novel in its use of a ""single"" take: the first 15-20 minutes is one continuous shot, weaving through the fuddled depths of backstage theatre between cast and crew. The colours throughout are key to these shots not becoming tiresome - bright neons and glowing warm lights bathe the set, emphasising the emotions felt in each scene. Perhaps my favourite part of the film, however, is the seamless interlinking of both scenes and music. More than once, the near constant drumming accentuates scenes so well, along with the amazing orchestration of movement in and out of the theatre itself.As for the cast, you couldn't ask for much more - Keaton is great as a slightly haywire actor on the brink (with his alter ego muttering alongside him), but Norton shows his true ability by nailing the range of an aggressive, temperamental but caring theatre journeyman devoted to his work above all else. Stone, Galifianakis and Riseborough also lend their talents well.Birdman is worth watching purely to admire the feat of stringing these long takes together: however, a worthwhile plot and intriguing development also gives this film an edge not seen often in cinema today.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

possibly not as good as the sum of its parts.,"OK, so like many bozo film fans, I ran into the theater expecting a clever, knowing pastiche of the 'Super Hero' Genre. The modern super hero film is becoming increasingly knowing, the clever CG and the 'graphic novel' a sophisticated character in it's own right.Birdman, will get this surely, do something clever, making smart reference to the modern film? Sadly it does not, the central character that the film plays with is from that Michael Keaton era of super hero film, the early Batman who was more super hero cut out than anything particularly sophisticated.It is almost as if the film has arrived at the self referential cinema party ten years too late. There are many smart references to the relationship of critic and artist, the loud and dumbed down international blockbuster vs earnest artsy Broadway play.For me the two outstanding scenes are when Riggan and his wide eyed daughter face of in a way that only a Father and his grown child can. The scene is full of pathos and Riggans sense of loss of his own relevance and identity is palpable. The second scene when Riggan confronts the theater critic in the bar is also remarkable a fulcrum and catalyst for Riggans sense of identity and purpose in a fast moving always on consumer culture. In this respect the critic is death itself a macabre demon a great deal more sophisticated than the Birdman character who plagues his past memory and present sense of the world.An interesting film with some real high points bogged down by an anger which is clearly directed at the industry, an industry that is simply a mirror of public taste. With this in mind, who is the middle finger aimed towards?",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Iñárritu gives us another eccentric masterpiece,"Alejandro González Iñárritu's brilliant tour-de-force, ""Birdman"", is a most audacious dark comedy about a cinematic ex-superhero trying to make a comeback with a Broadway play, but that's only the setup. It's unorthodox to a flaw: many will find getting up to speed difficult with its hyper-kinetic madcap burst of verbal fencing amongst its cornucopia of stars (all at the top of their game), headed by Michael Keaton playing the title character.I deeply love Iñárritu as a filmmaker. His best work conveys a cinematic exuberance that comes close to a Mahler symphony in its scope, forming a synthesis of despair and joyfulness in rendering the human experience. He's made five films to date, each of which won countless awards at Cannes, Venice, the Golden Globes and Academy Award nominations. His first three films comprise a trilogy utilizing intersecting stories, the best of which, ""Babel"" (released in 2006) took a year to shoot in four different countries, and begins with a sheepherder and his two sons in North Africa and culminates with a deaf and dumb naked teenage girl in a penthouse at the top of a skyscraper in Tokyo. It won Iñárritu Best Director at Cannes, and is still Iñárritu's masterpiece. ""Birdman"", however, is a complete about-face from the triptych epic to a simpler, more focused drama with tour-de-force directing that shows him at the peak of his powers.Iñárritu's camera moves everywhere, gliding and flying about (as if the entire film is virtually one long single take), following actors' movements, going through doorways, behind stages, into the street, even up to the roof and beyond -- while a soundtrack of drums underscores the action like the nervous approach of an intracranial hemorrhage. This is a film that demands much of its viewers, but the intelligent ones who allow themselves to sink into the marvelous mosaic of the experience will find something to revel in, and eagerly want to revisit after getting their breath back. A rich, extravagant celebration in cinema that fully deserved the 2015 Oscar for Best Picture.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
A Fantastic Film That Covers a Broad Spectrum of Ideas,"Birdman is directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu (most known for the excellent ""Amores Perros"") and stars Michael Keaton as Riggan, a washed up actor who used to play a superhero (Birdman) and wants to be taken seriously, which leads him to write a play for Broadway. In the midst of this, he is struggling to have a relationship with his daughter Sam (played by Emma Stone), and is forced to deal with an extremely demanding and overall hard to work with lead actor named Mike, who is wonderfully portrayed by Edward Norton.As the title states, the film isn't just about the making of this Broadway play. It's about blockbuster movies, a superhero obsessed culture, it's about pretentious film critics, and struggling to bond with your family. It's about struggling to find purpose in your life. This film is a lot more complicated than a plot synopsis would have it appear, and the film and it's messages, especially the ending, can be interpreted in thousands of ways.Monologues are one of the first things that come to mind when I think about this film. Emma Stone delivers a seriously powerful one to Keaton, and Keaton delivers potentially the greatest monologue of all time (slight exaggeration, but one of the greatest) to a film critic. These monologues are a true testament to the ability of these actors and actresses. Like I mentioned earlier, Norton portrays the character of Mike extraordinarily well, in fact it might even be his best performance next to Fight Club. Keaton is amazing, much worthy of his Golden Globe win and his Oscar nomination, and Emma Stone is great, as always. It impresses me that these characters were able to remember their lines with such long takes. Speaking of which...For those of you who don't know, the whole film, besides the beginning and close to the end, is designed to look like one take. You can spot some places where they most likely used editing tricks to make it look like one take when really it was just a transition into another take, but other than that, the film is completely seamless. The one take cinematography makes you feel like you're actually there with the actors, tagging along with them for the ride. ""Rope"" from Hitchcock pioneered this style, but Birdman nearly perfects it. This is truly a remarkable achievement in cinematography, directing, and editing.The writing is fantastic in addition to all of this. With perfect comedic timing, excellent (previously mentioned) monologues, and just really good banter between the characters, the films kinetic directing perfectly matches the the energy of the writing.The single flaw I have with this movie is the drum based soundtrack. It feels very out of place, and doesn't have the same energy the rest of the film has. It kills some moments, but this is a very small price to pay for the scenes when it's not playing, which are just incredible.With wonderful performances by it's excellent cast, a great comedic tone that blends perfectly with the drama, and some excellent direction, cinematography, and editing, this is a film that perfectly displays a mastering of the craft. The drum based score might be a bit ""meh"" but it's a small price to pay for this profound experience. Go see it. One of the greatest films of 2014.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Extraordinary,"This film was simply extraordinary. Masterful. I don't think I've ever seen a film like it, and I know I haven't seen anything comparable on stage or screen in a decade. The screenplay and directing - so tight, not a moment of wasted space (well, there might be one gratuitous scene, but otherwise, flawless). I could watch this film every day for a week and still find something new to contemplate.The acting performances were very good: Michael Keaton, good, though very Michael Keaton. Ed Norton also strong, as was the rest of the cast although Zach Galifianakis delivered one of the weaker, more one-note performances. Though this film, for me, didn't seem to be about the actors. They all came together to tell the story - no one was a distraction.If I were an actor, I would kill to work with Inarritu. Kill.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Keaton Delivers One for the Ages,"Birdman (2014)**** (out of 4)Michael Keaton delivers the greatest performance of his career as a washed up actor trying to get his life and career back on track by staging a play, which he wrote, directs and stars in. The only problem is that he's battling a crazed actor (Edward Norton), his just-out-of-rehab daughter (Emma Stone) and various other dramas. Through all of this, perhaps in his mind, the superhero character he's best known for, Birdman, keeps trying to tell him the comeback isn't on the stage.Director Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu has created one of the most original and brilliantly witty satires of actors, Hollywood and Broadway. There's no doubt about it but the director has really created a behind-the-scenes look at a struggling actor but not only given us a glimpse into his career but also all the added drama that comes with trying to do something that you should probably fail at. BIRDMAN is a film unlike anything else I've ever seen and that's something rather hard to do in today's day and age. The film not only tells the story of this struggling actor but it then bitterly asks about what's more important. Wealth? Fame? Should an actor have dignity and go for the art film and respect? The movie drops a lot of names throughout and it's look at these subjects makes one think of ALL ABOUT EVE and Robert Altman's THE PLAYER.There are so many wonderful things here but we can start on the technical side of things. The cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is some of the greatest you're ever going to see and it's so spectacular that this ""small"" film just needs to be seen on a giant screen. To say the cinematography is a masterpiece isn't an overstatement because it's just amazing to see how it's constantly moving, gracefully floating from one situation to the next and only standing still whenever it makes us enter the souls of the people we're watching. Everything from the lighting to the placements are downright flawless and it really creates an atmosphere like no other film. The drum score by Antonio Sanchez is another masterpiece as it perfectly pulls us into this world.Then, of course, there are the performances, which rank as some of the best you're going to see this year. Stone is simply wonderful in the role of the daughter who just never had her dad around enough. There's a scene where she loses it on her father and the perfection in the performance can't be missed. Norton also delivers one of his greatest performance as the ""serious"" actor who can't stand or control the real world.Both Naomi Watts and Zach Galifianakis are also excellent. The real highlight is without Keaton who has to play comedy, wit, satire, drama, tragedy and a maniac depression.Sometimes all of these emotions are needed within one short sequence and to see Keaton pull it off is just some truly inspirational. Keaton has always been an underrated actor but he delivers a performance for the ages here.BIRDMAN goes through a wide range of emotions but there's no denying the director's brilliance in holding it all together. This film could have gone off the rails on so many levels but when you step back and think about it, how it's all held together just gives you some added faith in creative minds out there today.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

What do we talk about when we talk about filmmaking?,"Birdman or the unexpected virtue of ignorance is this year's film of the year. A remarkable deep satire on modern Hollywood shot and panned out so brilliantly it leaves one shocked and stunned with emotions long after the credits start running.Genuinely and passionately portrayed by M. Keaton, Birdman follows up a once-famous-now- washed-up movie star (Riggan Thomspon) who is trying to revamp himself by directing, writing and acting in his own adaptation of a love story. Riggan, just like all of us to an extent, has a big ego, which is portrayed as a physical character in birdman, a representation of something that Riggan was never able to let go. He misses the fame, the power, the fans; his desire is to be on the top again. After all, we would all love to fly across Times Square, high above everyone else. And this is all a part of a great, hilarious and clever sarcastic joke that Inarritu allows us to see.Every major character in the movie is a satire on Hollywood and it's ways. From the co-actresses starring in the play (brilliantly portrayed by Naomi watts and Andrea Riseborough) who only desire to make it and get recognized, Riggan's agent who only cares about the public outcome rather then the one of his best friend, the critic that puts her own emotions and thoughts above everything else, audiences reactions when Riggan actually shoots himself on stage, to finally Riggan himself, who can't stay true to the twitter-and-facebook era and simply dreams of making it big again, despite all the difficulties and the sheere absurdity of doing something as blunt as his own theater production.Yet on the side of this all, Riggan's wife is the most sensible of it all, and maybe the only thing Riggan has in his life that is true, real. She loves him for who he is and seemed to adjust to his ever growing ego, but you can clearly see how she despises it all, everything to do with this industry and it's pretentious people. And we see this echoed in their conversation just before the final scene, where Riggan can finally be honest enough to say that he regrets it all, not being with his family enough for the most part. Yet was is still so striking and inspiring about Riggan is his inability to give up, no matter what obstacles come his way, he has managed to put them aside in various ignorant (remortgaging his house that was meant to be for Sam) and hilarious (dropping a light bulb on an actor he didn't like) ways.Mike is another character that adds so much needed diversity and angle to this film. He is a complete opposite of Riggan, he couldn't care less about the critics or what people think of him, as opposed to Riggan, he can only be himself on stage, he can't get it up with women and seems like a self-absorbent and ignorant character. His ego clashes with Riggan's, but Mike's ""Birdman"" isn't quite the same as Riggan's – he seems genuinely happy with what he has achieved and most importantly he is confident in everything he does, the exact opposite of Riggan himself. This provides a superb contrast into two completely different yet very similar people.Everything is amplified even more with an amazingly original drums-only soundtrack that is so emotionally powerful it almost takes your breath away. Adding an even more original one-shot directing style makes this movie really stand out. It is a daring and honest experiment that in my opinion is a trillion times harder to pull off then something like boyhood.The controversial ending simply represents the transformation of Riggan from Birdman to his stage character, who kills himself in the end. On the last scene we see Birdman, however this is the first time when he is not talking to Keaton, finally birdman's time has come and Riggan is able to move on by flying and exploring uncharted territories of his own. He was finally able to let go of Birdman.What are we doing here? – is the question asked by Michael (Ed Norton) to Sam (Emma Stone) at one point in the movie, which might just be the subtle sense of it all.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

Birdman,"A washed-up actor, who once played an iconic superhero, battles his ego and attempts to recover his family, his career and himself in the days leading up to the opening of his Broadway play.Birdman is directed by newly Oscar winner Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and stars Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, Naomi Watts and Emma Stone. This film deals with a multitude of theme: one existence, one place in real life, how you view your own life, duality, Critics, family life, drinking, special effects and blockbusters. Firstly, the way the movie was filmed surprised me: the film is made to look as if it's one continuous shot through clever editing techniques, really long takes and some very skilled actors to accomplish that. It feels like the opening shots of Goodfellas but for the entire movie which is a mind-blowing experience and kind of revolutionary. I can't even fathom how a movie can work like that. This aspect of the film makes us feel like we are behind the scene, on set with these people, it feels absolutely real. The score is very jazzy and feels unpredictable which is very similar to the movie itself. Michael Keaton plays Emma's Stone father, they have a difficult relationship. In fact, they all feel like they are pretending in real life and throughout the the movie Keaton character ears the voice of Birdman in his head telling him to do things; he also happens to have some mysterious power of some sort. This movie is WEIRD. Keaton character battle is a little bit like Dumbledore's saying ""You do what's right or you do what's easy."". Undeniably every character in this film is dealing with an intense psychological issue of some kind that makes them feel split as they're two halves for one whole. It touches also, on distance, what your place in the world is and what you're here for. The movie is filled with brilliant metaphorical imagery which install thoughts into your brain, explained afterwards through very good film making and excellent acting. I can't say it enough but actors are AMAZING. Michael Keaton pulls off the best performance of his entire career, Edward Norton is the best he's been in years and Emma Stone may be the best she's ever been.Birdman approaches blockbuster movies, not in an insulting way, it questions our vision of this industry. However what hold the biggest impact on me is the way this film deals with Critics in general. In a scene Michael Keaton literally explodes and exposes in a monologue each and every problem film criticism knows nowadays. It's heaven! Indeed, film critics do not talk about film making anymore, they do not talk of a scene structure or shot composition, they are looking for a quote they can put on a DVD cover (yeah DVD because I'm old fashioned). I'm guilty of those things myself but it doesn't make his point less relevant to me. An other scene assault on audience members that don't care about anything but green screen and explosion sequences. I do absolutely love good action movies and some big fun entertainment movies but I also respect Art films that are trying to be just ART: a film that has so much thoughts provoking behind and so much to say about Humanity, relationships and also movie business in our society. It emphasises perfectly the conflict of Hollywood right now: Blockbusters Vs Indie Movies. If you are in a Blockbuster it doesn't mean you're a bad actor as well as if you are in a smaller production it doesn't mean you're a good actor. This is breaking the fourth wall and talking to all of us. Plus, the fact that they reference real Hollywood people such as Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, Ryan Gosling or Jeremy Renner. Those references are things we actually know as entertainment, as Hollywood movies and actors. It makes it feel more real, like it is happening in our world.Overall everyone was great in this film. I felt like I was part of it, I was there, it was unique and original. Birdman is one of those movie you're glad someone made it happened. We really do need more movie like this one! After this movie you are going to notice all the scenes changing and all the jump cuts involved in the editing process of a movie, EVERYTHING. It's going to drive you nuts!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"A Complex, Multi-Layered Cinematic Treasure","I am amazed that ""Birdman"" ever got made, but not surprised at all that little American creative talent was involved in making this film. It's too good for Hollywood.Most people know the premise by now: a one-time movie star, known primarily for his appearances as a superhero, is trying to reinvent himself as a Broadway star, writing, directing and starring in an adaptation of a Raymond Carver story. A bold choice, for certain.In a standard Hollywood film, Riggan Thomson (embodied wonderfully by Michael Keaton; I'd like to know how close the Academy vote was for Best Actor) would have faced a predictable story arc, culminating in Riggan's triumph at the end. I am not saying that doesn't happen, and I am not saying that it does. What I am saying is that at no point can you be entirely sure which way this film is going.That's because director Alejandro González Iñárritu is too clever a filmmaker for that. He took the technique pioneered by Orson Welles in ""Touch of Evil"" and developed its full potential. Connoisseurs of cinema know it well: the first six minutes of that film are in one continuous six-minute take, packing in half the information the audience needs to understand everything that's coming.Iñárritu understands the sort of choreography, blocking, and basic effects needed to pull that off, and in ""Birdman"" he does this over and over again, using the tracking camera to change perceptions and to make transitions from one character's point of view to another. Not only is it excellent cinema, the technique also increases the sense of theater: to pull these shots off, the actors have to rehearse over and over and over until the single smooth long take can be accomplished without tricks. All that's added is a jazz drum score by Antonio Sanchez. (This is the only original music in the film, and, while it does its job, and does it well, you'd never buy the album unless you really like drum solos.)The story is complex, multi-layered and driven by character; Clint Eastwood is all but alone among American directors when it comes to placing character at the center of a story. We are treated to many of Riggan's demons, not the least of which is the goading voice of Birdman, who would love to get his job back. He's also plagued by family problems; his daughter Sam (Emma Stone, very believable as a spoiled Hollywood brat) is, due to her personal history, unemployable except as her father's personal assistant, and it's not a recipe for familial harmony. We also never quite know with Riggan what's real and what's not; Iñárritu treads that tightrope with finesse.Edward Norton adds plenty of sparks as Mike Shiner, a certified Broadway star. It would be very easy to wreck the train in this part; for all I know, Norton might actually be the vain artiste with a highly overdeveloped sense of his importance and the value of his extreme methods; what matters is that at no time does the aroma of ham ever come from him. I've never seen Norton better.The film nicely skewers the entire Broadway scene as well; if ""Birdman"" is your first exposure to Broadway, nobody could blame you if you never bought a ticket. The scenes with nasty Broadway critic Tabitha (British TV actress Lyndsay Duncan) had to have been pure malicious joy to write and play. Safe to say people like me apparently aren't very welcome in the theatrical world.I believe most audiences will be as entertained as was I, and the more discerning viewers will want to watch this film several times in order to fully understand Iñárritu's art. This will be a hard one to top.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

A Man Divided,"The must-see spectacle of 2013 was Alfonso Curron's technically brilliant Gravity, widely praised for its innovative use of the long take. This year's Birdman, made by fellow Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, seeks to one-up the long takes of Gravity by seemingly having one continuous shot.It isn't a single take but that in no way diminishes the superb camera work. Instead of cutting between characters the camera glides to them, taking on a life of its own at times. The disembodied camera floating down hall ways and stairs feels both surreal and exhilarating when paired with the upbeat jazz score. The behind the scenes of a theatre production have never been more thrilling. Birdman is a bold technical exercise and instead of the B-movie that Gravity was under the surface, Birdman has soul.Michael Keaton plays Riggan, a washed up ex-Hollywood Superhero who is attempting to restart his career by staging and staring in a Broadway play. However, Riggan hasn't left the past behind and the Birdman character that made him famous still plagues his thoughts. He is a man divided, in Freudian terms his psyche is split. Part of him longs for the glory days of Birdman while part of him wants to prove critics wrong, showing them he is more than just a celebrity.The internal turmoil of his life mirrors the external chaos of his stage play. In an act of fate, a falling camera takes out the sole incompetent actor working for him who is replaced by the talented and egotistical Mike Shiner (Edward Norton on top form). At first Mike appears to be a god-send but quickly becomes another obstacle for Riggan. Besides stealing the spotlight in the play, Mike also develops an interest for Riggan's daughter (Emma Stone) who is fresh out of rehab and has clear daddy-issues. One of the female leads in the play claims to be pregnant with Riggan's child. Stuffed to the brim with dramatic tensions, Birdman is reminiscent of the high- speed comedy dramas of Howard Hawks.Birdman is the first of two mainstream Hollywood satires this year, the second being David Cronenberg's Maps to the Stars. Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (who also wrote the screenplay) fires shot after shot at the self-obsessed culture of Hollywood. This culture which at least in myth was one confined to the California hills, has now transcended Tinsletown with the dawn of the internet. Now with Facebook and Twitter everyone is just a video post away from fame and, as Edward Norton reminds us after his massive on-stage erection goes viral; there is no such thing as bad press.If there is a criticism of Birdman, it's how ambitious the film is. Alejandro seemingly throws all his ideas at us and the film moves at such a brisk pace that they all can't be absorbed in a single viewing. A more restrained approach, focusing on fewer topics but in more detail instead of attempting to take on all of celebrity culture in 119 minutes may have better served the film. However, despite the chaos, the film still works, thanks in no small part to the outstanding performances in the leading and supporting roles.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
fickle industry leads to a very interesting movie,"Alejandro González Iñárritu's ""Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)"" recently won Best Picture. Now that I've seen ""Birdman"", it's going to take some explaining. Michael Keaton stars as a washed-up actor known for playing a superhero - sounds like a reference to Keaton's role as Batman, doesn't it? - attempting a comeback by starring in a Broadway adaptation of a Raymond Carver story. The actor is nearly at the end of his rope, exacerbated by the people surrounding him. Meanwhile, the superhero won't leave him alone.The movie is filmed primarily as one long shot, as though the audience is directly witnessing the action. And boy is there some action to witness! Overall the movie focuses on the entertainment industry's fickleness (of which the industry's ageism is a symptom), the issue of typecasting, and the abundant egomania. As Samantha tells Riggan, the play is a vanity project. The movie gets more and more surreal as it progresses, with the contrast between Riggan's mental breakdown and presumed superpowers growing more apparent.I don't know whether or not this was 2014's best movie. ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" and ""Boyhood"" were also really good, but I haven't seen many of last year's movies. But without a doubt I can say that Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography deserved its win. In the end this is a movie that I highly recommend. And I hope that everyone paid attention to Alejandro González Iñárritu's reminder that the United States is an immigrant nation.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Excellent,"A (moslty) single-shot movie in the vein of Hitchcock's Rope (there's even a sly reference to it right near the beginning), this film stars Michael Keaton as a washed-up Hollywood actor, famous for playing superhero Birdman, trying to regain his clout by starring in a Raymond Carver adaptation (which he wrote) on Broadway. As the film opens, one of his co-stars is injured on set (thankfully, as far as Keaton's concerned), and he replaces him with famous but difficult stage star Edward Norton, who proceeds to throw the show into complete chaos. Other characters include Keaton's lawyer/manager/best friend Zach Galafianakis, his daughter Emma Stone, his other co-stars Naomi Watts (Norton's girlfriend) and Andrea Riseborough (Keaton's own girlfriend), as well as Amy Ryan, Keaton's ex-wife. Keaton is also stalked by the disembodied (at least at the start) voice of his character Birdman, who taunts him and urges him to do awful things. This is a high wire act, and it's pulled off beautifully. Sure, it's a bit stagy and a bit pretentious (as are all of Iñárritu's films), but, because of the setting, it works. It also helps that all the performances are so great, and it's aided immeasurably by the cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki. I also like the mostly drum score by Antonio Sanchez, which gives the whole thing a jittery feel. I wasn't quite sold on the ending. It may have been foreshadowed thoroughly, but it just didn't quite work for me. I don't mind that they broke away from the one shot for the epilogue, but I don't like the way they did it. An excellent film, though, most certainly.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

Overacting, poor script, and unrealistic dialogue all fitted into the formula for this flick. It was Hollywood's overindulgence to itself.I am glad Michael Keaton got a chance to star in a movie but his acting was so over the top.

'Through the Looking Glass',"I rarely bother to do more than rate a movie, unless it had some profound impact on me. To say that about 'Birdman' would be an understatement.This movie left me feeling as though every emotion I've ever experienced and every thought I've ever had were condensed in 2 hours of amazing cinema and then reflected back at me, defying me to stare them in the face, right there, in my seat.The need to be relevant. The despair upon figuring out that there's no such thing. The need to create an identity. The angst upon realizing that holding on to it might make you miserable. The need to connect with others. The emptiness of seeing you're actually alone. Love. Unconditional, familial love. Practical, day-to-day, love, or lack thereof. Dedication to one's craft. Elation. Societal approval. Anger. Self-hatred. Self-deprecation. Regret. Fear of dying. Detachment. Meaninglessness.These are only some of the themes that struck a chord in me.I think that what these people have achieved is phenomenal. Michael Keaton displays an acting range unlike anything I've seen in a while and has an intensity that is mesmerizing. The sheer courage of taking on a role that basically has him looking in the mirror is worth a round of applause. Edward Norton's character is the embodiment of the Actor, with a capital 'A', not unlike Norton himself. Emma Stone is perfectly believable as something other than cute and proper and has a few very powerful scenes. Overall, the entire cast is superb.Some people are disappointed with the plot and the action. Others say it's a pretentious actor's movie. Many think it's a satire of show business.It may very well be some or all of those things. But, to all these people, I say: you've missed the point. You need to look in the mirror, too.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Finally a smart movie,"I'm writing this review with one purpose to respond to all those stupid and unreasonable haters who ''watched'' the movie. I don't really understand all the hate. I'm lying actually. I understand them completely.The title is Birdman.You expected a superhero movie, didn't you? Nope! Not this time. You see that's why you're disappointed by a movie. Because you expect it to be something that it's not. I'll tell you what this movie is about. It is a subtle satire of the sensationalism in the American entertainment industry and of the movie critics of today. A movie in today's world is not a movie if it's not a prequel of a prequel's sequel and if it doesn't involve some kind of heroes. But when there is a movie that demands of you to uh...I don't know...think while you're watching it there it goes: ''It's a load of crap...It's terrible'' and so on and so forth. In my opinion this movie really makes us think about what kind of movies we watch and how much of the attention we are paying to the acting in general. Is the theater dying out because of the sensationalist movies that we watch without thinking for ourselves after watching it. So we just say: it was good or It was bad but we don't know why we say it. It is just like that. If you were watching this movie without thinking about it for real afterward it is no miracle that you didn't like it because you are brainwashed by exactly those sensationalist crap we today call ''good movies'' and you didn't understand the message this movie wants to put out into the world. But if you didn't understand the movie you don't have to hate on it and immediately trash it. Just admit: ''Okay. I didn't understand what this was about''.

"bold, masterful, and memorable","Riggan Thomson was a famed actor who gained recognition for playing the lead role in a superhero film series. More than two decades later, Riggan has faded from the limelight and is continually tormented by a derisive inner voice and a vivid, overactive imagination. Still determined to stay relevant and be recognized as a serious actor, he takes on the task of writing, directing, and starring in a Broadway adaptation, taking his girlfriend, his lawyer/best friend, plus his estranged, strung out daughter, and a talented but loose cannon method actor along for the ride. An intense, surreal, and immersive movie experience with terrific dialogue, outstanding visuals, clever, self-referential humor, and a story that's riveting from start to finish. Nearly every actor is phenomenal across the board, and Iñárritu's crafty directorial style is astonishingly effective, allowing for several tense tête-à-têtes between characters that'll shock and amuse. An impressive and unique piece of work, with an ending that'll leave much to talk about afterwards. ***½",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
special effects,"OK this may have been pointed out before but there are a lot of camera shots in front of mirrors. A lot. Obviously the camera crew weren't seen but did anyone apart from me think that what was seen in the mirror didn't reflect(!) what was in front of the mirror.How did they do that? Did they digitally remove the camera crew (which is OK but time consuming) or did they film twice, the mirror scene and then the scene in front and stitch them together?It was uncomfortable watching and trying to figure it out.Also where do you think the actual cuts came.

"Strange, maddening, and seriously overrated.","There's no doubt in my mind Birdman will divide audiences. You will either go with its heightened sense of reality, or disconnect with it entirely.Filmed and edited in a ""single-shot"" style, Birdman demands for your complete attention, and never gives you a moment to breathe or look away. It feels very much like a play. It has undeniably brilliant moments, with fantastic performances, impressive camera work, and directed with a great eye for detail. The performances are truly the highlight, with Keaton and Stone delivering career bests.Keaton in particular, turns in a brilliant performance as the deluded Riggan, an actor washed up and hungry for artistic recognition. In fact the entire cast is great, and there is an urgency is nearly every scene that really captures the chaotic behind the scenes atmosphere. It puts a harsh mirror onto the art scene, where you feel trapped in the business, where the only choices seem to be selling out, or staying with egoistic actors and the pretentious critics who judge your earnest work by spitting on it. Much like a reflection of what is actually happening in the movie industry now. Blockbuster franchises like Marvel thrive while indie movies have a much harder time to survive.Iñárritu commits so much into the style of the film, that it becomes rather joyless. Everything impresses on a technical level, but never resonates. It succeeds in putting you into the shortsighted view of Riggan by essentially almost never leaving the Theater set and outside street for the entire movie, but it robs the movie of any scale or sense of consequences. Everything felt small. All we see is the set, the stage, and the streets outside the theater, and for a movie that asks you to never look away, its became surprisingly visually bland as time went on. The tradeoff is in the immersion factor, which Birdman absolutely nails.At the end of the day, i cant say i enjoyed of Birdman. Parts of it has incredible emotional resonance, but for a majority of it, i appreciated its technical accomplishments, yet it felt cold at its core by the end of it.The brief flashes of dark comedy give it a strange tonal imbalance, with some of the fantasy sequences serving as the foundation for the final shot, which ends on the now clichéd ""art-house ambiguity"" shot. The performances carry it up, and i suspect its a film that art students would gladly study over, picking apart its themes and marveling at its technical prowess. And rightfully so, it should be applauded for that.As a viewing experience, its decent if you want to try something new, andlike art-house films. And Keaton's soulful performance alone is worth the price of admission, but everything else falls flat and feels empty.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
An Audacious Window to the Struggles Involved in the Creative Process and the Aftermath of Superstardom,"Anybody who's been through the creative process of either writing a book, a play, a short film, or anything in which they put their blood, sweat, and tears into will relate to the story depicted in Birdman.Riggan Thomas once was a superstar. He became famous twenty years ago with a trilogy of superhero films in which he played the protagonist. Now that he has aged, and went through several years of being the shadow of his former self and struggling to get other significant roles, Thomas tries to reinvent himself on Broadway with a play that he wrote, that he will direct and in which he will act. However, we get to witness the creative and psychological struggles that he faces as a father, as a once popular washed-up actor, and as a creator caught up with the voice of Birdman, the one role that once made him beloved by the public, but that is now haunting him.It's delightful to see Michael Keaton on the big screen again, especially in this role. Yes, he is the one man that became notorious after playing Batman in Tim Burton's cult films. I do not want to diminish the part of Keaton's career that came between these two Batman films and Birdman, but let's just say there is a similarity between Keaton's career and his character's that brings some kind of magic to the aura of this film.Keaton is unforgettable as a man dealing with a wide array of creative, parental, and professional struggles. The whole cast does an unbelievable job of portraying Riggan's entourage, through a palette of atypical performances from great actors (Edward Norton, Noami Watts, Zach Galifianakis, Emma Stone, among others).Birdman in itself is a huge technical accomplishment. It's worth watching for that alone. Alejandro González Iñárritu's directing is a visual tour-de-force. Rarely do we see almost an entire movie be delivered through a tracking shot (which was slickly sewn together at a few key spots). The setting is also explored in a way that feels almost suffocating at times, drawing a great metaphor between the backstage corridors of the theatre/Riggan's dressing room and Riggan's tortured mind. The only few times he gets out of the theatre's walls, he never goes really far, and his mind never leaves the place.Also, Birdman would not be the same film without its dialogue, which leads the whole film, in line with the stunning directing, to both hyper realistic and surreal places at times. Its pin-point timing, along with the constantly moving camera and the minimal soundtrack, dictate a tightly measured pace that brings the viewer in the middle of a neurosis that's peppered with just the right amounts of humor and drama.Impressive work in all aspects.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Pretty Good,"I wanted to love this movie. I used to be a big Batman fan, Michael Keaton is great overall. I didn't hate this movie. It was somewhere on the good side of ""middling"" I guess.The ""one-shot"" thing was great, very impressive technically. It was so impressive actually that it sometimes distracted me from the story. But the story was good. I cared about the lead characters. Emma Stone is unbelievable in it, I'm not surprised she's up for awards at all.I think there were some missed opportunities in terms of payoffs to things they were setting up, but I hate spoilers so I won't go into specifics.If you at all are interested in theater, or the process by which stage plays are put on, and all the politics and craziness around them - then this is probably a must watch. If not, then you might enjoy this just as an interesting story.Great actors. Good story. A few missed opportunities but OK.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
A Must Watch Film,"What to say about Birdman...... The Acting in this movie is just on a different level the most movies could hope to even be, i mean of the last 10 or so years i would probably put Birdman and Whiplash in the 10 for acting. Edward Norton is my stand out in Birdman hes amazing I forgot he had this in him it's been a while since fight club but he showed his true power in this movie. not that hes ever really done poorly but this was just something special. Emma Stone and Oscars will be something you start to hear a lot together in the future, maybe even the near future she showed off her skill in this movie just with her facial expressions alone. Michael Keaton gives a career best performance as well showing some range i never knew he had. Throw in a great supporting cast with great performances from Zach Galifianakis, Naomi Watts and Andrea Riseborough, and you have one of the best movies maybe of all time if not.. then surely of 2014. And its not that i think that the plot and story line are even that great, i mean they're really good but its basically a midlife crisis story about a recovering celebrity, that happens to have a great script due to some fantastic writing that meshed the comedy and drama so well. Capped off with some of the most beautiful directing and cinematography i have ever seen in my life, the whole one shot style that just follows everyone around was amazing.

Not My Thing,"This movie is for critics, film industry folks, folks who romanticize the profession of acting in my opinion. While the cinematography is cool, some actor performances are strong, the film plot was ever so thin. The struggle of an actor with his ego? The artsy interludes of introspection with visual effects? It is really self involved and cheesy for folks in the film/acting industry to try to highlight the troubles of being a star. I mean are you kidding? Acting and fame are so hard? What? The story of introspection of an actor is really just......like a film crew was sitting around bored and said ""...lets make a film about ourselves!"". Granted, a very talented film crew and actors.I see the stories told by film in a different light. Maybe I am just a fan of a movie like the made up 'Birdman' they talk about in the Birdman movie. I want a plot that interests me about something. For example, I had just seen Snow Falling on the Cedars (again) prior to checking out Birdman. There is no comparison. Both films cover human introspection and a story....but SFOTC is a story that touches folks and Birdman.....doesn't for me, not even close. I felt nothing seeing Birdman, but SFOTC immersed me in feelings about the plot, the story, and so the characters.I watched the Acadamy awards recently, don't always. The fact that Birdman won so many awards reminds me that the decisions of the Acadamy don't reflect the public's choice for the best films. The Acadamy's choices truly reflect the film industry's choice for best films, based on film industry folk's interests. Clearly they were interested about a film that highlights acting/entertainment topics that are important to them. Now it makes sense to me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

Michael and Amy's work in bringing life to the most sweetest couple when everything was said and done was beautiful. Zach's enactment of manning the ship is excellent. Andrea's and Naomi's characters could be reflections of two different timelines of sane story. The essential sorrows of life preoccupied with on stage personas , clinging onto the tiniest of hopes.

"It's a Bird, It's Insane","Greetings again from the darkness. Hollywood versus Broadway. Screen versus Stage. It's always been a bit Hatfield's and McCoy's. The basic argument comes down to celebrity versus artistic merit. Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu blurs the lines with his most creative and daring project to date. It's also his funniest, but that's not really saying much since his resume includes Babel, 21 Grams and Amores Perros.The basic story involves a former Hollywood actor well known for playing a superhero (Birdman) many years ago. Riggan is played by Michael Keaton, who you might recall garnered fame playing Batman many years ago. While the parallels are obvious, it's quickly forgotten thanks to a majestic performance from Mr. Keaton. Riggan is trying to prove something to himself and the world by writing, directing and starring in a stage production of Raymond Carver's short story ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"".Riggan's quest runs into every imaginable obstacle, not the least of which is his own internal struggle with his ego ... voiced by his former Birdman character. This could have been a more detailed exploratory view of the creative ego, but we also have money issues, casting issues, personal issues, professional issues and family issues.Zach Galifianakis plays Riggan's best friend-agent-lawyer, and is the film's most grounded character. Yes, you can read the sentence again. A slimmed down Zach perfectly captures the highs and lows of the guy charged with juggling the creative egos and the business requirements of the production. Naomi Watts plays the exceedingly nervous and emotional film star making her stage debut, while her boyfriend and co-star is played by Edward Norton who, well, basically plays Edward Norton ... a critically respected method actor who is known to be a royal pain in the keister. Riggan's current squeeze, who is also an actress in the play, is played by Andrea Riseborough who gleefully blindsides him with an announcement that is unwelcome and untimely. Riggan also receives visits from his ex-wife (Amy Ryan) and is employing his fresh-from-rehab daughter (Emma Stone) in an assistant role. As if all of this wasn't enough, a tipsy Riggan botches a pub interaction with an all-powerful stage critic (Lindsay Duncan), and the two trade incisive insults regarding each other's vocation. So all of these characters and worlds collide as the production nears the always stress-inducing opening night.After all of that, it's pretty easy to state that the script is the weakest part of the film. Instead, the directing, cinematography, editing and acting make for one of the most unique movie experiences of all time. Director Inarritu and famed cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and the editing team, deliver what appears to be a single take for mostly the entire run of the film. Of course we know it can't possibly be a single take, but it's so seamless that the breaks are never obvious to us as viewers. We have seen a similar approach by Alfred Hitchcock in his 1948 film Rope, but this time it's a frenetic pace, and the maze-like setting in the bowels of NYC's St James Theatre that makes this one a spectacular technical achievement.Lubezki won an Oscar for his camera work on Gravity, and he has also worked on multiple Terrence Malick films, but this is the pinnacle of his career to date. It's impossible to even comprehend the coordination required for the camera work, the actor's lines and marks, the on que jazz percussion score from Antonio Sanchez, and the fluidity of movement through the narrow halls and doorways of backstage. It's truly a work of art ... whether a stage critic thinks so or not! Most every cinephile will see this one multiple times, but mainstream appeal will certainly not grab ahold. Reality, fantasy, insanity, and morbidity all play a role here and frequently occupy a character simultaneously. These aren't likable people, and the film's crucial scene forces Mr Keaton to speed-walk through Times Square in only his tighty-whities, leaving his character in the proverbial ""naked on stage"" situation. It's rare to see such unflattering looks at both the stage and screen worlds, and it's also rare to see such fine performances. Three standouts are Keaton, Norton and Stone. If the industry can avoid presenting awards to itself for ""cartoons and pornography"", these three should all capture Oscar nominations.Beyond that, director Inarritu, cinematographer Lubezki, and composer Sanchez deserve special recognition for their incredibly complex technical achievements. For those who complain that Hollywoood only produces re-treads, sequels and superhero movies, take a walk on the wild side and give this one a shot. You may not love it, but you'll likely admire it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Intensely overrated,"Obviously an absolutely stellar cast with performances to match. Some really interesting direction, and a decent script. Unfortunately the creators were so caught up with the style they ignored the 11th commandment; Thou shalt not make a boring film. That's the only problem. Literally everything else is good, but when a movie is boring, the rest goes out the window. A big problem I'm noticing in recent years. Movies like Pacific Rim for example are condemned for a basic storyline and reliance on action, which I totally agree with, but out of the two, I'd rather watch the action, because movies are about escapism. We watch them to get lost in another world, to empathise or collide with the characters. I've tried to watch this multiple times and I find myself appreciating little aspects before quickly losing interest. I feel like I could watch Michael Keaton criticise his least favourite toothpaste at length, but this movie just saps any momentum and it's difficult to get through. I think it's worth a watch for the sake of the great performances and the continuous concept. I'd suggest splitting it into sections, but that kind of defeats the purpose of the direction, which seems to be the greatest ambition of Iñárritu yet its priority is what causes the film to fall flat.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"Witty, Clever, Funny and Dramatic","I was excited to go and see this film in the cinema and thankfully I was not disappointed. Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is a Black Comedy starring Hollywood powerhouses like Michael Keaton and Ed Norton and is directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu (whose name I can't pronounce).The film is about a washed-up actor who is famous for portraying a popular comic book character on the big screen. This actor is Riggan Thomson played by Michael Keaton who was made famous for the exact same thing. In an attempt to become ""relevant"" again, Riggan decides to adapt a novel into a Broadway stage production.One of the elements to this film that really stuck out for me was the performances. Michael Keaton and Ed Norton were arguably the best, but Emma Stone and Zach Galifianakis also give stellar performances. All the actors have great chemistry on screen which helps to produce an enjoyable experience.Furthermore, another thing that I liked about the film was that it wasn't entirely a Comedy, or entirely and Drama. It incorporated different elements from different genres and combined them beautifully together. There was never a point where I thought the change in tone was forced. I found myself laughing at some points and completely entranced during others.Even though I mostly enjoyed this film, there were downsides in my opinion. Unfortunately I'm a bit too used to the conventional Hollywood style of filmmaking. This film seems more artsy than most films in main stream cinemas at the moment so those, like me, who don't often visit Art House cinemas may find some parts a bit weird and out of place. However, overall it didn't hinder my viewing experience too much.In conclusion, Birdman is a great film that definitely deserves multiple viewings. Michael Keaton and Ed Norton give Oscar worthy performances, the story is great and offers different tones to please different viewers. If I was to have a gripe with this film it would be that some bits are a bit weird to me.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Birdman is a soulful satire that venerates cinema's artistic merits while simultaneously condemning it's contamination through commercialisation.,"If you've noticed during previous telecasts of the Academy Awards, there's always a short spoof movie they play at the beginning of the event. It's a parody of the year's top films where Hollywood lampoons itself. They just love to be at the center of the joke as long as the joke is told by them. Directed, produced and co-written by unconventional Mexican filmmaker Alejandro G Iñárritu, Birdman, sub-titled Or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance, is one such wholesome parody – a pitch black satire where Hollywood makes roaring fun of Hollywood.And it's a ton of fun from the very first scene where we see Michael Keaton levitating in his underwear. Setting off a chain of parodies is Keaton playing Riggan Thompson, a washed-up middle aged actor whose last blockbuster saw him playing the titular superhero in the 1992 sequel, ""Birdman 3"". Now 20 years on, he is desperately grasping for former glory by trying to reinvent himself as a theatre artist. As the director and producer of a Broadway play, Riggan has a few problems to tackle, starting with his alter ego, the growling and grotesque voice of Birdman (also Keaton) who taunts Riggan into insecurity and regret. These are bizarre sequences and we are left guessing whether Riggan is mentally unstable or possess supernatural abilities no one else knows about. His second problem is the passive-aggressive nature of his lead actor, Mike Shiner (Edward Norton). Known for his brilliant method acting but also infamously impulsive and abrasive, Norton is another caricature of himself as Shiner, an actor whose outbursts leads to a series of disasters on the play's preview nights. With the big opening night just around the corner, Riggan is left to overcome his final obstacle – A New York Times theatre critic (Lindsay Duncun) who loathes Hollywood celebrities for commercialising and thus tainting what was once true art in theatre.One of the main parodies of this multi-layered film is the fact that the current horde of superhero films from DC Entertainment and Marvel Studios didn't quite exist until Keaton kick-started the genre in 1989 by playing the titular superhero in Batman. It gets better. Keaton hasn't been in the limelight since his 1992 blockbuster sequel, Batman Returns, the same year Riggan peaked in his acting career. Coincidence? Not really. Such is the ingenuity of this film but Keaton and Norton aren't the only ones lampooned and we'll get to that later. Comprising of an ensemble cast, Iñárritu has plenty on offer and they all deliver in uniformity starting with Emma Stone as Riggan's feisty daughter and assistant, Zach Galfianakis as his best friend and manager, Naomi Watts as his lead actress on her first Broadway show, and Amy Ryan as his ex-wife and voice of reason.Why Birdman will be an Academy Award magnet is obvious. Besides Keaton's comeback of the century and Norton's outstanding delivery, this film is theoretically a movie within a movie and thematically about an actor making a comeback. That's ample flattery to win over The Academy and precisely why The Artist went Oscar crazy in 2011. But irrespective of how this film fares at the 2015 Academy Awards, the real pull is how intensely immersive this film is in creativity, imagination, performance and technical excellence. After winning an Academy Award for last year's Gravity, cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki is back with more wizardry by shooting the entire film in one continuous take; Seamless digital binding, yes, but otherwise impossible to achieve conventionally. And bolstering the pace is some fantastic music from composer Antonio Sanchez who uses just percussion instruments with perfect timing.That Iñárritu ends the film with ambiguity could be received with mixed reactions. Like Christopher Nolan before, Iñárritu leaves it open to interpretation and that's always a good thing when giving a film a long lasting impression. Thoroughly entertaining with endless hilarity, both slapstick and dark, Birdman plays on cinema's artistic merits while simultaneously condemning it's contamination through commercialisation. To this effect there's a mini action scene dedicated to the kind of profound stupidity found in a Michael Bay film. Another shot of a meteor plummeting to Earth speaks volumes about the death of stardom and the birth of insanity. If you look closely at the fire ball, you can almost see Bay's name on it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Best thought provoking film of 2014,"Just watched Birdman last night...I love the feeling of coming out of the theater without having all the answers and discussing with your companion how they interpreted it! This movie has multiple layers and you were invited to peel off the onion in a fluid cinematography that adds value to the overall story. Lubezki applies the concept of ""camera always running"" to add realism and to make the audience part of the movie. Amazing how a 2 hour long movie which is shot basically all inside a theater, is able to capture everyone's attention without getting dull, due to genius acting, directing and the relentless camera-work. Keaton, perfect for the role, given his history with superhero and being forgotten for so many years, delivers a visceral interpretation without worrying about his image, with pure focus on the character. Norton is at his best- the rehearsal scene with Keaton is amazing, and so is his dialogs with Stone. A movie that criticizes mainstream cinema, and will make you reflect about choices, about family, career, and love. The end is left open for interpretation. Without spoiling it, in my opinion it is part of the main character's delusion and how he wants to be admired. After all, what do we say when we talk about love?",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"Best film about an aging artist's career reboot on Broadway? ""All About Eve"" still in the lead...","I liked Iñárritu much better when he was turning out heavyweight arthouse fare like ""21 Grams"" and ""Biútiful."" In his earlier films he didn't hesitate to take on XXL themes like chaos theory (""if a butterfly flaps its wings..."") and globalization; the results were sometimes pretentious and incoherent, but they weren't boring. In his big US crossover move, he narrows the focus a bit--high vs. Pop culture, Broadway vs. Hollywood, print vs. Social media--and in the end he seems to be playing to an even tinier audience of showbiz insiders and fanboys (see ""Trivia"" on this page for a long list of smirky inside jokes and gossipy riffs on the cast's defining roles and personal quirks).After a promising early scene in which Method fanatic Mike Shiner (Ed Norton) shows struggling director Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) how to cut a few lines from Raymond Caver's famously laconic prose (I guess that's an in-joke too, but it's a pretty good scene), the film completely loses momentum. We couldn't get too interested in Riggan's high vs. Low dilemma or the brittle backstage romances, and Inárritu's trademark magic realist touches (very effective in ""Biútiful"") just seemed pointless, notably when Riggan uses his telekinetic powers to trash his dressing room. The final question the film raises--whether Riggan has lapsed into self-destructive psychosis or achieved transcendence and taken to the skies--is of course left unanswered.Maybe the rigid shooting schedule and the showoffy single-take cinematography (which apparently didn't allow for many retakes) put too much pressure on the cast; only Emma Stone seems really comfortable in her role. Long story short, ""Birdman"" was a major disappointment and a bit of a chore to sit through; the only time I felt any honest emotion emerging from the murk was when the film was quoting someone else--Keaton reciting the last lines of the Carver story or a few quiet bars of a Mahler song suddenly becoming audible (amid bursts of infernal drumming) on the soundtrack...",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Reminds us of the heights that cinema can soar to,"In Birdman's opening moments then we are introduced to Regan (Kearon) as he meditates in his underwear and levitating a few feet off the ground. It is a rare moment of tranquillity that he rarely gets throughout the film. But it is not long before the Skype alarm goes off and he is thrown back into a world that continuously mounts the pressures upon him as he tries to mount a stage show to revive his career and reclaim his former glory he had when he played the hero Birdman.It is this lurking shadow that appears to haunt the entire film with his conscience acting as a dark reminder of how far gone his heyday is. As he looks to the sky he imagines soaring once more to the heights he previously had above everyone else in the world. On top of which he constantly tackles the fears that this stage show is going to be a failure and he no longer has a true place with the fear that he just doesn't matter any more.The film makes some interesting statements on both the current nature of modern cinema (with his thoughts telling him that all people want now is explosions and monsters) with the desire to be respected and validated as an actor but fearing he will never get this recognition he deserves. As these pressures build with the constant drumming that follow us throughout the film, we are brought to boiling point as we witness the pressures that past fame can be and the dark daemons it can create.Iñárritu's vision of combining the entire film into what appears to be a single continuous shot is one of the most ambitious pieces of filmmaking in recent years. Just like any theatre production there is no chance for error with every actor, every prop and the camera movement having to work to be perfectly timed so as not to ruin these long takes. In spite of all this risk the film is carried out near flawlessly with all the comedic timing performed incredibly with not a single moment wasted in the film, constantly passing from scene to scene seamlessly. It's a mixture of technical mastery and cinematic genius that Iñárritu has used to create this masterpiece as through these shots he can switch from showing us Regan's reality before transitioning to beautiful and at times dark fantasies as the film blurs the line between the two and throws us in to the constantly shifting mental state of our protagonist as he longs to fly again to the heights he once flew.With the long continuous shots there are many times in the film where the film focuses on nothing but the actors performance to guide the scene. Fortunately the entire cast were up to the challenge with every member of the cast giving a standout performance. Though it must be said that Keaton particularly gives the performance of a life time. Obviously Keatons background as the caped crusader and the many parallels between Keaton's life and the character creates an additional element of relevance. But what really makes him perfect for the role is how he incredibly matches both the comedic tones and the emotional hardships that the script calls for. Throughout every scene Keaton nails everything in the script going from a silly clown one minute walking merrily down the street in nothing but his underwear to becoming an emotional wreck questioning his entire production in the very next scene. The film clearly hinged on getting a spectacular lead and without a doubt they got one in Keaton.Every actor assembled similarly gives a career high performance, with each deserving all the acclaim that can be given. They all handle the long takes in stride ensuring that every line delivers the comedic or emotional punch that the scene calls for. And the script is perfect at facilitating these masterful performances ensuring that each character gets a stand out moment ranging from Stone's emotional explosion as she tells her father that he doesn't matter to Norton fighting Regan in his underwear. Each character in the film is well fleshed out even taking the highlight off Keaton at points.Dark, emotional and constantly funny, Birdman is astonishing. It's flawless performances mixed with Iñárritu's visually stunning style to create what is nothing short of a masterpiece that reminds us the unbreakable limits that cinema can soar to.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

As you watch this movie, you get the feeling that the filmmaker is deliberately trying to impress you (or somebody) with cutesy gimmicks in various forms, rather than just make the best possible movie he can.I also agree with various user comments that a lot of the dialog is weak (if not also just plain unattractive) and the actors' performances become irrelevant when the subject matter doesn't reach the feelings of the viewer. At the one-hour mark, I found myself starting to look at my watch to see how much longer this would go on. The bottom line is, for all the cutesy gimmicks, this just doesn't work for way too many viewers. The fact that industry insiders claim to get a lot out of the story doesn't cure that.That said, although I was tempted to do like so many other articulate reviewers have done and give it a solitary one star in an effort to drag down its seemingly incomprehensible 8.1 rating (at this juncture, at least) to something more reasonable, in the end I decided to be intellectually more rigorous and gave it a six, my usual rating for a movie which is technically good yet is not compelling entertainment at any level for even the most thoughtful of lay audiences.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Best movie I've seen this year.,"I hesitate to even write a review of this movie. I feel that my inability to write to the standards of all the internet armchair movie critics out there may cause people to focus more on my (lack of) writing prowess and ignore the fact that this is an amazing film. In spite of my hesitation, this film moved me and inspired me to put my thoughts out into the ether; so, I guess I'll just have to take my chances.I will start by saying that I think this movie reaches guys more than women. Not that it's necessarily a ""Man Movie"" but the main character is a man and the film is essentially about his struggle. Men will identify with it. I, specifically, identified with the character. Not because I've ever been a movie star or that I've even tried to challenge the world to take me seriously... but because I've had to deal with the humbling feat of dealing with, falling victim to, and eventually overcoming my own ego; as I think most men of a certain age have.The depiction of Keaton's character realizing that his whole struggle of self discovery was really just his ego's way of tricking him, talking him into buying more of his own B.S. It was a kick in the balls to my manhood, as I saw my own failings and egocentric behavior in Keaton's. It was touching, heart wrenching, hilarious, humiliating, and uplifting to share in his experience on screen. Like I said... guys will get it more than women. My girlfriend like the movie, but not nearly as much as I. But what does she know? She's just a girl and has never been a movie star.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Masterclass,"I don't use that word easily. This movie is a masterclass of acting, writing, cinematography, directing and story telling. Probably the most original movie I've ever seen. Michael Keaton, Amy Ryan, Edward Norton, Emma Stone and Naomi Watts are at their absolute best with powerhouse performances. What Alejandro Inarittu achieved here is nothing short of miraculous. I put this movie off for so long because of the title but I finally watched it tonight and I get it. Four Academy Award sweep of the top categories for Best Picture, Best Writing, Best Cinematography and Best Director all well deserved. But I was shocked there were no Oscar wins for any of the actors. The actors would go on to win SAG awards and Golden Globesand other awards for acting but the academy really should have awarded Oscars for at least three performances. If you haven't seen this film give it a go.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"Wow wow wow, the directing, the acting, the story.","So many good things about this film, where to start... the director does long one shot takes to great emotional effect. Hand held camera is a little shaky which is such a great metaphor for the characters being filmed. The layers of satire are just amazing, and the casting was dead on. Performances were captivating and the characters so interesting. What makes this film great tho is how it makes you think. What is really happening and what does the director want you to think? Oh boy that ending delivered and makes the film stay in your head long after the credits rolled. One final note, the music was awesome too.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
The play is the thing,"Alejandro González Iñárritu has made a wonderful technical film in Birdman with the way the set has been constructed and the movement of the camera to make it look like one long shot. It is also a deceptive film as a second viewing gives you more clues apart from the obvious Chekhov's gun principle.I do wonder if Iñárritu had already signed up Michael Keaton before the script was written or completed. It was well known that before Birdman Keaton was doing inferior films such as Penthouse North and heading television movie land. Although having watched Batman Forever, no reasonable person can fault him for turning it down.In Birdman Keaton plays Riggan, who once made it big as squawking superhero Birdman, years before the current superhero craze. Since then he has been washed up. He tells his daughter a story of being on a plane where he sat a few seats from George Clooney, the plane encountered some trouble and Riggan realises at this point that if the plane crashed, it would be Clooney's face plastered on the papers. The irony being that Clooney was the second actor after Keaton to play Batman and a few years later Keaton was playing a small role in a George Clooney thriller.Riggan is directing, adapting and starring in a play in Broadway to reclaim his career. His recovering drug addict daughter Sam (Emma Stone) is assisting, girlfriend Laura (Andrea Riseborough) is a co-star. When the main actor gets injured at rehearsal, it is suggested by another actress Lesley (Naomi Watts) to bring in celebrated but difficult stage actor Mike (Edward Norton.)Straight off the bat Riggan realises just how good Mike is, how the play comes alive when he speaks the dialogue, yet also what a nuisance he can be, throwing tantrums. Mike only feels real on the stage, this includes being sexually functional.Riggan needs to get the play working by opening night and impress the theatre critic of the New York Times and she is sharpening the knives for Riggan. A celebrity (she refuses to acknowledge him as an actor) like him does not belong in polluting the New York stage.Of course Birdman is more than just Riggan getting a play ready. In his quest to be relevant, he hears voices of his alter ego, Birdman. We see Riggan moving things by just thinking about it, is he on the edge of sanity or somewhere between life and death?The film demonstrates how good Keaton could be, it is an astonishingly good performance from an actor known for light comedies back in the 1980s. It is a film with good performances. Norton like Sean Penn shows how effortless he can do comedy even while being intense. The real plus about the film is how you can interpret the film. It is a satire on Hollywood fame (with all its cultural references it will also age quickly) but also a reflective film about life and death.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
I Can See Why It Was Popular With The Thespians,"Somewhat surprisingly the Oscars this year were heavily weighted towards Indie cinema . This is a good thing in my opinion if only because I'm old enough to remember previous decades where Hollywood had a reputation for giving Oscars to studio films with a feel good factor or in recent years awarding films that were being produced by Miramax . Nominating films not made and marketed by the big studios brings some deserved attention to a mainstream audience that would have probably been ignored at the box office otherwise . If a film wins Best Picture then it's got to be worth seeing so that's why I went out of my way to see BIRDMANWith hindsight the Academy voters have played it very predictably and safe . A film where the protagonist is burned and on the comeback role is something that appeals to award voters . Cast someone like Bill Murray in LOST IN TRANSLATION or Mickey Rourke in THE WRESTLER and you've got something that's approaching meta-fiction . Put Michael Keaton in a film where he plays a washed up actor and BINGO we have a film voters will love . Add constant name checks to other actors working in Hollywood today and you'll have voters falling over themselves filling in those ballot papersI'm sounding a little bit abrasive and cynical here aren't I ? Yes I am and it's deliberate and I don't want to over state my case here but BIRDMAN is a mildly enjoyable film but no more than that . I can imagine the Oscar voters - the majority of whom are actors - watching the screening and departing to the bar and saying "" Hey I remember that happened to me on Broadway"" and "" Do you think that was supposed to be ... "" . In other words you can understand why it didn't do any spectacular business at the box office but got a lot of awards",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"Great Film, But Still Over-hyped and Overrated","A washed-up actor who once played an iconic superhero (Michael Keaton) must overcome his ego and family trouble as he mounts a Broadway play in a bid to reclaim his past glory.All the hype said this was an Oscar contender for Best Picture, as well as for Best Actor. As of now, the film has walked away with two Golden Globes: Best Screenplay and Best Actor. The former seems fair enough, but the latter is misguided. Keaton, while good, never seems to go outside his comfortable range, while Bill Murray in ""St. Vincent"" blew Keaton out of the water.This is still a great film from a technical standpoint, with credit going to the editors and the cinematographer. And the acting is certainly not bad (though Emma Stone seemed out of play). But the praise Keaton is receiving seems out of place, and exaggerated.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

Birdman: The Dark Night,"There'a a lot to like about this movie and I understand why it has received so much attention at various film festivals. Basically, it's about a group of dysfunctional people who try to work together to put on a play. The main problem with the film is that sometimes the plot is lost in the clouds of their dysfunction. In other words, dysfunction sometimes takes center stage. On the other hand, it has some thoughtful dialogue much of which revolves around what it means to be successful. What is the true measure of success or of living a successful life? Is it that many people like you? Is it that you are praised by critics? Or is it something more ethereal, such as being loved by people we value? These and other darker, existential questions are addressed by the movie with varying degrees of success.Although predominantly a drama there are a number of darkly (and not so darkly) humorous moments. The clash of generations, the vapid and transient nature of modern measures of fame, interpersonal relationships, and the clash of fragile egos all supply ammunition for comic relief. Towards the end of the film, people begin to appear more as symbols than as real people, which is not necessarily bad. Much in the entertainment industry is criticized and ridiculed, such as the arrogance of critics who think they can control this world with their reviews. In an attempt to show their power, they will value personal motives over the true artistic merit of a work. It seems like the writers and producers of Birdman are taking their own satiric revenge at times.The acting throughout the film is tight and flawless. I would not be disappointed if the actors or the film win academy awards. The film addresses some big questions, which makes it more thoughtful than most films and, considering the modern zest for easily approachable box office films (something this film criticizes), may limit its appreciation by some movie-goers.Keaton's character occasionally lapses into inner dialogues and fantasies which, though interesting in their own right, interrupt the flow of the film at times. There were also moments when I thought the film was trying too hard to appeal to modern expectations or to younger audiences, perhaps as a box office ploy. This was too bad because I thought that the film had a retro feel to it overall. That said, these shortcomings were minor.In the end, I found it an entertaining and amusing film. So if you want a movie that's meatier than most of what's out there today, you should not be disappointed in watching Birdman.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
A remarkable achievement in filmmaking.,"""Birdman,"" directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu, is a captivating and innovative film that explores the complexities of art, identity, and celebrity culture. Starring Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, and Emma Stone, the movie tells the story of a washed-up actor who attempts to revive his career by mounting a Broadway play.One of the film's most impressive features is its use of a single, continuous shot. This technique creates a sense of intimacy and immediacy, as the camera follows the characters through the halls and backstage of the theater. The movie also features a dynamic and eclectic score that contributes to the film's frenetic energy.The performances in ""Birdman"" are exceptional, with Keaton delivering a career-best turn as the lead character, Riggan Thomson. Norton and Stone also shine in their supporting roles, bringing depth and nuance to their characters. The film's exploration of the relationship between actors and their craft is particularly compelling, as it delves into the pressures and insecurities that come with performing.At its heart, ""Birdman"" is a meditation on the nature of art and the role that it plays in society. Through its portrayal of the theater world, the movie questions the value and validity of commercial success and asks whether true art can ever be divorced from the commercialism of modern culture. It also examines the concept of identity and the struggle to reconcile one's public persona with one's true self.Overall, ""Birdman"" is a remarkable achievement in filmmaking. Its innovative use of form, exceptional performances, and thought-provoking themes make it a must-see for anyone interested in the intersection of art, identity, and celebrity culture.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Everything and nothing,"Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu seems to have cheered up a bit since his reach-for-the-noose-depressing trilogy of 21 Grams (2003), Babel (2006) and Biutiful (2010). The first two are excellent films (I haven't seen the third), telling honest and brutal human stories powerfully played by expert, distinguished actors, but show no signs of the kind of energy, wit and satire of his latest, Birdman, this year's Best Picture Oscar winner. We spend two hours inside the world of washed-up actor Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton), who is having a later-than-midlife crisis trying to escape from his superstar days of being a costumed hero and trying to re-invent himself by writing, directing and starring in his own play.For a film that spends so much time poking fun at the self-contained world of thespians and the empty yet highly-craved escapism of blockbuster cinema, Birdman manages to be, in it's own strange, unique way, a bit of both. When we first meet Riggan, he is meditating mid-air. He moves objects telekinetically, and his actions and decisions are criticised and mocked by his former alter- ego, Birdman himself. We are in and out of our protagonist's head, which is made even more delirious by the magnificent camera-work by Emmanuel Lubezki, one of the finest in the business. With the odd exception, for the most part Birdman appears edit-free. Day turns to night in the same shot and vice versa. But this is no mere gimmick.We're on the cusp of the opening of What We Talk About When We Talk About Love, Riggan's stage adaptation of Raymond Carver's (very) short story. One of his actors is injured by a falling piece of equipment and is replaced last-minute by primadonna d**k-head Mike Shiner (Edward Norton) whose girlfriend Lesley (Naomi Watts) is already working on the play; his daughter Sam (Emma Stone) is fresh out of rehab and is resentful of her father's late-in-life attempts at reconnection; his female lead Laura (Andrea Riseborough) is pregnant and tells Riggan it's his; and pompous art critic Tabitha (Lindsay Duncan) is determined to destroy the play before it's even played. It's a stressful time for Riggan to say the least, and with the illusion of watching one continuous shot, we feel right there with him. With the near- constant jazz score, we also feel every beat.But the technical aspects of the movie do not overshadow the story, and it is played out by a gifted ensemble. With the loose, free- spiritedness of it all, Keaton breaks free and shines, excelling at the moments of comedy (Riggan's semi-naked dash through Times Square is a highlight), and moving us in the more tender moments involving his sympathetic ex-wife Sylvia (Amy Ryan). He's also as precious as his fellow actors, disgruntled that Woody Harrelson, Michael Fassbender and Jeremy Renner are unavailable due to working on their highly successful franchises, resentful at he fact that he wore a cape before capes were cool. It could have been a disorientating experience, instead it's exhilarating. It could have also trodden ground covered before, but it's so on-the-nose that it feels fresh. And it may not be the best film of the year as Oscar may have you believe (my heart lies firmly with The Grand Budapest Hotel), but Birdman is everything and nothing, just like Riggan himself.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Short Review,"It is a story about an actor Riggan (Michael Keaton) who is past his peak days. In his peak he used to play a superhero, Bridman. Now in his later years he regrets that he didn't validated himself as a true actor. To right his wrongs he acts in and directs a Broadway show. So the whole film revolves around that show, it feels more like a play than a film. It is a satirical commentary on the bombardment of superhero films in our age. Keaton's performance was outstanding, along with brilliant performances by Emma Stone and Edward Norton as supporting cast. The cinematography was fabulous given there are very few visible cuts. But even more so because of the long takes, which would reach upto 15 pages of dialogue at a time! The music score is also worth mentioning which is performed solely on drums.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

"Sharp, funny & with career-defining turn from Michael Keaton","It's not hard to see why Birdman has divided audiences. It isn't an easy viewing experience and it would be all too simple to call it a 'Marmite' film, but it's not as straightforward as loving or hating Birdman; I think some people just don't 'get' it. And, no, I'm not setting myself above all others and claiming that I do get every point and nuance.Writer/director Alejandro González Iñárritu (21 Grams, Biutiful) has crafted a comedy drama of depression and insanity where the viewer isn't always entirely certain what is going on either upon the screen or in Riggan Thomas' mind. For that matter, Riggan isn't entirely certain where the dividing line is between reality and psychosis, so what hope is there for us?Riggan Thomas (Michael Keaton) is a washed up, wrung out movie star famous for his role as the titular Birdman. With his film career on the wane, his personal life in tatters and his mental state fragile, he endeavours to kick-start his career and prove that he is a real 'actor' by adapting, directing, staring and producing an adaptation of a Raymond Carver's short story, What We Talk About When We Talk About Love, on Broadway. The production is troubled with recasting problems, relationships, clashes with inflated and fragile egos and family issues including a daughter, Sam (Emma Stone), who is begrudgingly working as his PA. But these problems are nothing compared to the maelstrom in his head.Birdman is a very dark and frequently disturbing film that is lightened by occasionally also being very funny. There are snaps of dialogue and physical action that thrust a belly load of laughter into the air to lift the mood and the action, though mostly the action of language and retorts, keeps the viewer on edge. Antonio Sanchez' jazz drum score, however, scratches at the brain so that we are never truly comfortable, regardless of the humour and action upon the screen.The camera work is an absolute joy to behold. Periodically a film comes along (The Player, Atonement) that causes us to rave about a particular scene that is one long, elaborate shot and which must have been rehearsed and choreographed endlessly. Birdman is comprised almost exclusively of such shots that are so beautifully edited that it is frequently very difficult to see where one shot ends and the next begins, although it is difficult not to be distracted by Iñárritu's skill and play 'spot the edit' rather than concentrating on the film.Birdman is loaded to the brim with fine performances from Edward Norton's egotistical actor, Mike, to Lindsay Duncan's viciously cutting critic, Tabitha. With solidly impressive support at every turn from Zach Galifianakis, Naomi Watts et al, Iñárritu has filled Birdman with variety and sparkle from his cast. In any other year, Keaton would be looking pretty damn confident in the run up to the Oscars but he has a battle on his hands with Eddie Redmayne's turn in The Theory of Everything. Regardless of how much gold he wins this year, he is on blisteringly good form here as Riggan in what may very well displace Betelgeuse as his career-defining role.I'm not entirely convinced that Birdman is a film to enjoy, but it is a fantastic, mind-mending, disturbing experience of madness and surrealism that needs to be witnessed more than explained. Take a deep breath and go for it, but don't blame me if you emerge with your head spinning and less relaxed than when you went in.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Interesting film by very ageist for women,"Watched Birdman, interesting script and camera but as usual I got disgusted by the typical age gap between female and male actors. The protagonist is Michael Keaton (64), his ex-wife Amy Ryan (46), his lover Andrea Riseborough (33). The most important female actors are women aged 27 to 46, all very good looking. The only female actress of his age is the critic Lindsay Duncan (65) who is called that woman that looks like she sucked the buttocks of a man. It's disgusting to see that women are seem as sex meat from 12 to 39 and after they're 40 they're just ghosts and witches. I cannot be impartial, films like this are dictating that women are only worth before they turn 40, and we see this influence in real life too.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
I can't imagine cinema without Birdman now.,"There's too much context to go into for Birdman. There's the state of cinema today, the state of contemporary film criticism, the transformation of Alejandro Gonzalez Inarittu, the reliably spectacular photography of Emmanuel Lubezki, the relationship between film and theater, art and commerce, and Michael Keaton's blockbuster past. Birdman offers a lot of developments and comments on cinema and operates on so many levels. I'll admit, I love meta films like this. I'm not even invested in Keaton's career of his Batman of 25 years ago, but it's difficult to ignore the over-saturation of comic book films these days and how bringing him back can speak volumes. The film even makes a sly comment on the epidemic as they list of actors who've succumbed to the cape. While there's wry grit in its commentary, this isn't a bleak and mean- spirited venture, it's overtly satirical, and that's what makes it such an endearing experience.Of everything that Birdman is about, there's two factors that resonate with me the most. One, a factor explored by Edward Norton's brilliant but out of control actor Mike Shiner and a more nuanced symbolic approach by Lubezki's gliding eye, concerning the truth in fiction. And another, one which propels the narrative and protagonist, artistic legacy. The complete subtitle - The Unexpected Virtue Of Ignorance - smirks at this idea, hinting that it's better to be unaware at your own importance in culture. Keaton's Riggan Thompson is in hot pursuit of redeeming his legacy, smirched by his portrayal of a blockbuster hero in a past life. In risking everything, the film presents a fascinating argument on the importance of cultural impact by an individual and how they're earned. It's funny, the power of these ideas makes the universal theme of love in the Raymond Carver play the principle characters are performing feel trivial. Birdman wants love on a grand scale, as per its opening quote.It's no easy journey, jostling from bumps and bruises of his ego and motivation by disastrous preview nights, offstage actor drama and lashings from his vulnerable daughter. Keaton is subdued in this first hour, merely soaking everything in, yet slowly deteriorating. He's outshined by the whirlwind overzealousness of Norton's Mike, who's never been better or more welcome to chew the scenery and question everything. He's funny, abrasive and thoroughly profound. However, in the second half Keaton steals back the show, starting from a rant against the labeling nature of criticism. He bites hard. It's extraordinary and utterly disarming in a refreshing way. It's made sweeter by how much he's been knocked off his pedestal previously in the film. Every time he's stripped of his pride, the film compensates with giving him empowering feats of telekinesis in ambiguous fantasy sequences. In breaking the bounds of reality, it's utterly liberating and a stroke of expressionistic genius.While Keaton and Norton lead the herd, they're supported by a fantastic ensemble, as expected for an Inarritu film. Naomi Watts gives a tender performance as an actress eager to please in her Broadway debut. She may overplay it, but it's utterly appropriate and all the more engrossing, especially when placed beside Norton. Emma Stone, who's going to get the bulk of the supporting actress accolades, is terrific as Riggan's daughter, toeing an emotional high wire with the boldness to tumble off it. Andrea Risebourgh, Lindsay Duncan and Amy Ryan give ample support but Zach Galifianakis gives the most surprising performance of the second tier, anchoring the film in his sincerity and deep investment in the other character's lives and careers. If there are any flaws in the film, perhaps it would be that it's almost too precise. Is this an essay or a story? Offering laughs instead of tears, it's a fair critique, but one deflected by how incisive it can be at its most relevant. Doesn't stop the film from being satisfyingly overwhelming.Of course, the main aspect that sticks out is that one shot. Evidently still salivating from Gravity's ambition, Emmanuel Lubezki ups the ante. Yeah, he's the star of Birdman. It's fitting, this is about theater and there's no cuts. While it may feel self-aware, the film is self-aware itself so it's very fitting. It captures this chaotic and buoyant tone of the madness of the characters and the project, but without feeling outlandish. Antonio Sanchez' innovative drum score aptly does the same, often having the ability to snap us back into gear after a short serious interlude. It's all the ingredients for a delectable recipe. If any film can duel with Whiplash for my favourite of the year, it's Birdman. It's also my new favourite of Inarritu, a director I've loved since Babel which at the time was a film that really opened my eyes to what mature cinema can be. I can't say this touched me quite as off guard but it certainly articulates everything a lot better than anyone else can.9/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
A Picasso,"The Oscar and film awards season has been a fun one this year, featuring one of the most intense Best Actor races of all time, but the sad thing is how many movies have disappointed. ""Interstellar"" was one huge supposed Oscar player that fell out of the race once people saw it, and the word right now is that Angelina Jolie's ""Unbroken"" won't be as big a player anymore. However, since about July there have been two movies that have stayed in the race, and at the front of the pack. The first being ""Boyhood,"" a great contender for winning the Best Picture award, and the second is ""Birdman."" So when I entered the theater I was praying this movie would be all it was cracked up to be. Let's just say it didn't disappoint.Michael Keaton - an actor who used to be well known for playing the superhero Batman, but has since fallen out of the spotlight- stars in this movie about a man named Riggan Thompson - an actor who used to be well known for playing the superhero Birdman, but has since fallen out of the spotlight. See the similarity? In this film, Riggan Thompson is coming up on the opening night of his Broadway play which he has written, directed, and starred in as an attempt to reclaim some of his fame. As the play, and his life, begin to fall apart days before the premiere, Riggan begins to learn the difference between who he was, who he is now, and who he decides he's going to be.Though there is a strong sense of irony in having Michael Keaton play a washed up actor in this film, his performance makes you wonder why that irony was even possible in the first place. Keaton perfectly plays the comedy in his timing, the dramatic pressure in his actions, and the sad truths his character faces in his eyes. Keaton is thick in the pack of Best Actor contenders for the Oscars which is exactly where he belongs. Edward Norton leads the supporting cast of this film giving a performance that proves his incredible acting ability and makes us sad he turned down playing the Incredible Hulk in ""Marvel's Avengers."" Emma Stone, who typically sticks to sarcastic comedy roles, finds new ground here that we didn't even see in her dramatic breakout ""The Help."" Though I love Emma Stone, I've always been skeptical of her dramatic ability, but here I was surprised in the best way possible. Zach Galifianakis and Naomi Watts also head up the incredible balance of comedy and drama that was featured in this movie.In this world, there are two types of art.Let's say you walk into an art museum and see a Picasso. The colors are vibrant, the geometry is fascinating, and the techniques are entirely unique. People gather around this painting with you to marvel at the decisions this visionary artist made and the perfection created on the canvas. You tell yourself you're happy you got to see such a famed and outstanding piece of art, then you leave the building and hop in your car to go home. As you're driving home you flip on the radio to keep yourself from falling asleep. A song you've never heard before, but you really like, comes on and you start jamming all the way home. You get home and your friend is there. He asks you how your evening was, and you tell him all about the Picasso you got to see. Your friend is really interested so he hands you a pencil and a piece of paper and he tells you to sketch the Picasso for him. You look at him like he's silly, but he urges you, so you hesitantly pick up the pencil. That's when you realize that you can't remember exactly what it looked like, so you set the pencil down. Your friend then asks if you've heard any good music recently, so you tell him about the one you heard in the car. He asks you to hum it. Piece of cake.""Birdman"" is a great film. The actors are outstanding, the score made up of solo percussion is a genius idea, and the technique to make the film appear as a single take is not only successful but adds to the film as a whole. However, when the credits of this movie finish and you hear the last drum beat, the movie and everything about it comes to a complete end. This movie was hilarious, dramatic, and practically perfect in every technical way. ""Birdman,"" was a Picasso. This movie was absolutely outstanding, but the only thing I was able to take away from it was a couple funny lines.""Birdman,"" like a Picasso, was a technical masterpiece and the combination of that and how well reviewed it was resulted in me liking this movie without even thinking about it. Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu made the choice to give ""Birdman"" an alternate title. That title is: ""The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance."" I think that fits perfectly.I give ""Birdman"" an 8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Unique.  A challenging but hilarious master class in modern film making.,"It's as if Alejandro González Iñárritu and Michael Keaton have been on an unintended collision course towards the inevitable making of this art-house meets superhero movie - although Kick Ass managed to subvert the latter genre it only did so on a single dimension; this does so on multiple levels.To even allude to it as a Superhero movie is, of course, to massively understate what is a film bristling with more ideas than a month-long sabbatical at Stephen Hawking's house.It starts with the poster, moves onto the credits (the best I've seen for years) and then; scene one act one.Every scene brings another ""how did he do that?"" in fact ""how did he think of that?"" moment.In fact the scenic structure is the first big jaw drop aspect of the movie given that, essentially, scene one act one is all there is - it, arguably, never ends. Cleverly stitched together in the edit suite and captured by Emmanuel Lubezki the whole film is an homage to the ambitions of Orson Welles in his monumental ""El Rancho"" tracking shot from Citizen Kane.Lubezki's camera prowls the dressing rooms, corridors and backstage areas of a Broadway Theatre endlessly, where washed up ex-superhero (the Birman of the title) star, Riggan Thomas played in a career defining performance by Michael Keaton is mounting a self- funded, self-adapted, self-directed and self-starring play of a Raymond Carver short story.The trouble is; it sucks.But after the weak link in the four man cast is nearly decapitated during late rehearsals, a big box office stand in, Mike Shiner, ((played magnificently by Edward Norton) takes his place the day before the first preview. Shiner may be a true star vehicle and 'box-ioffice gold' but his highly contrived method-acting is a massive pain in the ass and causes mayhem both on-stage and off.Meanwhile, trying to direct the volatile Shiner plus his equally volatile girlfriend (more of a cameo but again brilliant by Angela Risborough) Keaton's character starts to fall apart, simultaneously haunted by his alter ego (the bird man that is embedded in his avian brain).The action is relentless, breathtaking actually, as it is driven along by an incessant jazz drum solo that peppers the score.Keaton looks and acts more and more like Bill Murray in his prime but his performance goes far deeper than anything I've ever seen Murray achieve (with the possible exception of Lost in Translation). It's dark, tragic and sensitive.The awful relationship he 'enjoys' with his clearly disgruntled 'assistant' and rehabilitating daughter, Sam, played to scuzzy perfection by Emma Stone is remarkable. In one scene Stone berates Keaton for his inept fathering skills to the point that you genuinely think her head might actually burst open. It's electrifying.As the frankly bizarre story unfolds more and more levels of pathos, black humour and tension are introduced; the pursuit of short term fame is brought brilliantly to life when Keaton 'trends on twitter' after an inadvertent stroll through Times Square in his jockeys. The veneer of fame and the dubiousness of acting ability - ""You're a celebrity not an actor"" sneers New York Times theatre critic played viciously by Lindsay Duncan in another notable cameo just before she sets out to crucify him: just because she can.And we meet up with Keaton's superhero past an an entirely unexpected way.The opening night of the play brings a denouement that I dare you to predict.You won't.You can't.I've had my eye on Alejandro González Iñárritu since his debut feature in 2000, the heartbreaking Amores Perros, through 21 Grams and Babel and most recently the battering ram that is Biutiful. All these movies deal in big issues around the human condition. All break your heart in different ways and all are light, very light, in humour. So for him to create a comic masterpiece such as this is all the more disconcerting really. It has many, many laugh out loud moments but at its heart lies yet another big human condition movie.How can one create true happiness in life when relationships are such fragile things in the world of celebrity?What is art?What indeed is fame?As Andy Warhol said; we all have 15 minutes of it.The trouble is, for many, the real stuff is like crack cocaine and we all know that's a hard one to kick.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
An Innovative Achievement,"From the richness of ""Babel"" and ""21 Grams"", we know Alejandro González Iñárritu has a knack for directing but he transcends to even greater levels of excellence with his astonishing work in ""Birdman"". He moves the camera, frames the shots, and sets up the material superbly but further dazzles you with his diligence in making a theatrical film experience. Iñárritu's ""Birdman"" is one of the few exhilarating cinematic experiences of 2014. It's the type of movie that not only dares some arduous and fresh challenges, but actually surmounts them gracefully.""Birdman"" develops a technique first established with ""Gravity"" last year in filming entire blocks of time within a scene in a single take. Emmanuel Lubezki helps Iñárritu capture ""Birdman"" with as little cutting in the film editing as possible. It slides around the actors and objects for nearly two hours without any noticeable moments where Iñárritu categorically moves from one separate shot to another.For 120 minutes, we see ""Birdman"" fly with this technique perfected by the directing and photography. The spirit of the theater is uncorked by this ""gimmick"", but to call it a ""gimmick"" is feels unjust--it's a move of artistic genius and technical mastery to enhance the storytelling. In addition to relentlessly gliding around the actors and through the sets, the cinematography is softly-lit and possesses a tender radiance, making ""Birdman"" easy on the eyes.""Birdman"" is one of a kind. In the most elegant ways, it pushes the boundaries of art film in mainstream cinema. The screenplays harnesses a meta theme to a dark ideology and comments on show business, specifically how the reputations of actors become linked to certain defining roles, the difficulty in achieving beyond that hump, and the criticism involved with show business in the media-obsessed world of today. With so much creativity on display in the technical and acting departments, the finely formulated dialogue should fade into the background but it doesn't.The cast of ""Birdman"" slays the project and unifies their talents for a spectacular result.For Michael Keaton playing this role must be so personal to him, and that seeps through from his real life into the fictional life of his character. Keaton has his fair share of ""Look At Me!"" moments, such as when his character violently demolishes his dressing room, but I find his acting to be more thought-provoking in fragile and sensitive than the noisy scenes, as when he intimately speaks with his ex-wife and daughter about the past. (Though one cannot help but stare silly at Keaton knocking every loud moment out of the park, like when he, slightly inebriated, confronts and disparages a New York Times theater critic at a bar.) This performance is capable of winning him Best Actor at the Oscars and a win would certainly be deserved.Edward Norton is the right-hand man to Keaton's splendid leading performance. Norton conducts himself with a buoyant, ceaseless energy and won't be overlooked by anyone in the audience. Naomi Watts continues her string of post-""Diana"" supporting roles, and she makes her role in ""Birdman"" terrific, tearing into the audience's emotions to larger extents than other actresses would be able to do in the role. Emma Stone is receiving raves for her work here, though I found her to be a step below Keaton, Watts, and Norton, there's something she brings to her work--a tranquil, quiet stillness most noticed in her final scene with Keaton--that justifies the praise. Amy Ryan and Zach Galifanakis round out the cast. Though they are of the lesser utilized additions to the ensemble, they squeeze everything out of their briefer scenes.""Birdman"" is resourcefully made, commandingly acted, and ambitiously envisioned; it's an innovative achievement.* * * * / * * * *Grade: A",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"Great performances, but ""restricted"" and over-sophisticated plot","As I have seen all feature films by Alejandro González Iñárritu, I did not expect neither trivial nor smooth watch, but I remember large diversity of people and topics from previous ones. Birdman, however, is focusing on persons involved dramatic art, their goals and issues, robed into Iñárritu's round-the-bend approach. Although I had some giggles and the performances of all more-or-less leading actors were pleasing to watch (particularly Michael Keaton as Riggan Thomson / Birdman, Edward Norton as Mike Shiner, Zach Galifianakis as Jake), I often felt that not all scenes and lines reached my mind, that I apparently missed inside jokes and stuff familiar to people daily involved in acting and play production (therefore, it is logical that The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has awarded 9 Academy Award nominations to Birdman this year). Thanks to skillful directing and camera-work, I did not get blah feelings, and quite a witty ending arrived earlier than expected, but still...My two close relatives have worked in different theaters, I know some actors personally, been to back stages, etc., and yet, Birdman remained out-of-the-way to me. I can't image how people with no or casual contacts with theater world could watch and enjoy Birdman's storyline at all. And even if I admire Keaton (well, always have), I think that ""Performance by an actor in a leading role"" should be awarded to either Benedict Cumberbatch or Eddie Redmayne this year.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"Is it a bird?  Is it a plane?  No, it's Michael Keaton's awesome performance...","Michael Keaton plays a washed-up actor, best known in his heyday as the star of the ""Birdman"" comic-book films, now trying to rejuvenate his name by writing, directing and starring in his own play on Broadway. From the opening beats (literally), I was transported into the fragile psyche of Riggan Thomas - a mind haunted by former glories and struggling to atone for a failing career, a failed marriage and an estranged daughter. The film is cleverly shot to seem as one long continuous take and unravels much like a play in itself. We meet the supporting characters, most notably an ego-obsessed actor (a superbly funny Edward Norton) and Riggan's angst-ridden daughter (a convincing Emma Stone) as he struggles to balance them all and himself while preparing for the play's opening night. Norton, Stone and the rest of the great cast (including Naomi Watts, Zack Galifianakis and Andrea Riseborough) are all on fine formbut this is Keaton's show. With ironic symmetry to his own career (I'm sure I don't need to remind you he was once Batman and a much bigger name 20 years ago) he gives Riggan a very personal touch, which may have or may not have been intended. A character desperately trying to escape his own narcissism, is given a brutally honest, captivating and heartfelt performance. The film may be a left field, almost avant-garde for some - it's not for your average popcorn muncher – but its' a highly refreshing experience. Just don't go in expecting a superhero film. Birdman is quite the opposite.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"Hrmm, not bad but not that great either really","Still not really sure how to describe this film at the end my girlfriend and I looked at each other and went ""eh it was OK"" guess maybe I was expecting something a little different because a lot of the movie was just a little dull and boring and seemed to try and hammer the same stuff into you over and over again, we get it already. This was classified as a Comedy Drama and while there were some funny moments something just felt like it was missing from the movie for me, it kind of left me with an empty feeling at the end. The first 40 mins or so just seemed to drag on and on. It was OK don't get me wrong it was watchable but I don't see why so many people are calling it a masterpiece, Schindler's List was a masterpiece you really think these two movies belong in that same category of greatness?",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
One of my favorites this year,"Birdman or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance is an amazing callback to the likes of Hitchcock, Kubrick, and Scorsese. The standouts of the movie are the long takes and directing skill. The performances are multi layered and cool. Everything reeks of an art house tone and quality.The move is about an actor played by Michael Keaton that is famous for playing a superhero; Birdman. He is tired of his reputation as a celebrity and wants to be recognized as an artist. His passion project is a play which he wrote, stars in, and directs. He pours all of his money and time into making it as good as possible. The story follows the actors in the play and the time up to opening. Keaton brings a performance like I've never seen from him. If all you've seen of his work is Batman you will no doubt be impressed. I personally was very surprised. From scenes were he's an actor playing an actor that acts in a play, to a hilariously funny fight with Edward Norton's character he constantly impressed me. Every scene that follows him with a tracking shot was implanted in my memory. One aspect of his character that I like was that he might possibly have super powers and it's left up to the viewer to decide. I love a character with multiple layers, and Keaton showed me that he either always had tremendous chops or he developed them in a hurry. He himself said it was his most difficult role, and I don't doubt it. Another actor that blew me away was Edward Norton. I'm not exaggerating; I think it was one of the best Norton performances. He plays an actor that has to fill in for an injured actor in for Keaton's play. As soon as he comes in for his first rehearsal he adds a new depth to the play. He plays an extreme method actor. Real emotion and real alcohol are essential for him to be at peak performance. His back and forth dialog with Keaton as they refine the script and their on stage chemistry is incredible. It felt like I, the viewer, was getting an inside look at the acting process. No matter how realistic or exaggerated that scene was I loved it. Norton is a lock as my pick for best supporting actor this year. Another stand out cast member was Emma stone. She plays Keaton's troubled daughter who seems to hang around the theater when she's not getting into trouble. Her big, bright eyes light up the screen. She has a really good scene that is close up on her face as she delivers a one take deconstruction of Keaton's character, yelling with ferocity I didn't know she had, she convinced me she could act then and there. I was never thinking of Gwen Stacy when I saw her and that's a good thing because her character is nothing like Gwen. She deserves any praise she gets. The rest of the cast like Naomi watts, Zack Galifianakis and Andrea Riseborough were all good. The cast as a whole can't be rivaled this year in the quality of acting displayed on screen.I opened with a comment referencing Hitchcock and I did so because the movie calls back to one of my favorite Hitchcock movies, Rope (1948). In Rope, Hitchcock filmed the entire movie in four to ten minute takes (because the film roles only went up to just over ten minutes) with editing tricks to make it look seamless. In the same way the director of Birdman (Alejandro González Iñárritu) wanted to make the entire film seem as though it was filmed all at once with no breaks. Iñárritu cleverly used special effects to pull it off. This style makes the movie like nothing you've seen before. Even when the scene advances to the next day the camera tilts up to the sky and then comes back down appearing to have never missed a beat. Visually, the way the movie moves could be tiring to some people because it forces the viewer to pay attention at all times. For me, after about ten minutes I got used to it. The movie spoils you with tracking shot after tracking shot. The directing is very good and I think, deserving of an Oscar.Over all you can't go wrong with this film. It has everything a movie fan could want and more. You have to think about what you're watching, and you may get something new each time. I would highly recommend you see it for its acting and directing accomplishments.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
An average film oversold by marketing gimmicks,"Director Inarritu's earlier works ""Biutiful"" and ""Babel"" were superior to ""Birdman,"" if one is not swayed by the special effects used in this recent film. His ""Biutiful"" also touched on paranormal gifts but there was some relevance for it in that film's plot. But ""Birdman's"" paranormal activity and imagination of flying around like a superhero are examples of playing to the gallery.What did the film offer beyond sex-drenched drivel and the creative world vs. critics battles? Little else.Check out Istvan Szabo's ""Mephisto"" (1981) (in Hungarian) which was far superior to ""Birdman,"" on the travails of a great actor while dealing with a somewhat similar subject. Ye,s Keaton was good in ""Birdman""; yes Lubeszki was impressive. But as a complete work, ""Birdman"" was just an average film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Frenzied high calibre hit with real bite,"(80%) Cinema and theatre combine in this oddball mash-up flight of fancy that results in something quite unlike anything else out there. It's also something that is really hard to know exactly what to make of it in just one viewing, but the fact is that I enjoyed it enough to happily sit through it again. In fact it may be brilliant and I simply haven't realised it. Only time will tell. But in the mean time this is a wonderfully assembled comic drama with brilliant one take direction that needs to be seen to be fully believed (even if you can spot the joins), the amount of work that must have gone into it is unimaginable. The writing, despite the story not being what one would call overly substantial, is razor sharp; and as everyone who's seen this already have thus far said, the acting throughout the entire cast is outstanding. This has its sights set on the jugular to many different aspects of the entertainment industry, from the differences of attitude in stage and screen; with critics getting a good roasting, which is both fun and brave.

A Saga of the Complicated Comeback,"Everybody seems to like the drama of a comeback. After all, there's something inspiring about anyone who rises from a great fall. And so it goes that Birdman features Michael Keaton portraying an actor who puts everything on the line to restart his career by staging Raymond Carver's ""What We Talk about when We Talk about Love,"" not the most easy-going material to act out or convey to an audience. Along the way, there is much support from Naomi Watts as an actress making her Broadway debut, Edward Norton as a smart-ass, temperamental, hot-item actor and Emma Stone, who plays Keaton's daughter, apparently neglected from growing up with a show business father. It's all very emotionally complicated and sometimes overbearing due to all of the characters' constant bickering, petulance, regret and hand-wringing. Also, amidst all of these real-life dramas, Director Alejandro G. Inarritu injects a kind of supernatural, whimsical element that may be more distracting than constructive. So, is the film worth seeing? Definitely. Might it be a bit overrated and less perfect than expected? In my opinion...yes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

The single-shot film is something so many filmmakers have thought about and tried over the years, but few have been able to successfully do. Birdman is the first to flawlessly pull it off (even though it wasn't truly a single shot). The problem is that gimmick made it more difficult to delve into the characters and story and instead pull attention to itself (the filmmaking) rather than the film.

Greatness or (The Unexpected Satire of Hollywood),"""Birdman"" is one of those films that's entertaining when taken literally, but fascinating when taken thematically.This is a dark comedy that explores the battle to remain relevant in the acting industry. It even manages to satirize how most people just want entertainment (blockbusters) instead of philosophical thinkpieces (everything the Academy nominates) while even snagging the Best Picture Oscar. But one of the themes in the film that really hit me (due to the performances from Michael Keaton and Emma Stone) was how constantly trying to become famous may start to alienate people. This is shown by the protagonist's strained relationship with his daughter.Michael Keaton's performance was absolutely great. He really gave his character a damaged feel, since he's trying to struggle between being Riggan Thompson and Birdman. I've never seen Keaton like this before, and I loved it.Emma Stone's performance was also really good. Although she was a supporting character, she did provide some of the film's dark humor, as well as some emotion (due to some of her dialogue). This really showcases her talent, and I'm glad she won an Oscar the year after (despite her performance not being THAT good in ""La La Land"").A lot of people talked about how the majority of this film looked like one continuous shot. And I've got to say, even though I know that this WASN'T true, it really looks like it was one shot.This film had quite a bit of dark humor, and it all really worked.One thing that really surprised me was the characters' parallels to the actual careers of some of the actors. Most notably is Michael Keaton, where he's been trying to get past his success as Batman and try to be taken seriously; this is strongly represented in his character in the film, who is trying to get past his success as Birdman and try to be taken seriously. Another one is Edward Norton's character. In real life, Norton is known for being a method actor who is extremely hard to work with; in the film, Norton plays a method actor who is extremely hard to work with. Coincidence? I think not.I know that this is a Best Picture winner, but I haven't always had good experiences with those. I loved some (""The Godfather"", ""The Silence of the Lambs"", ""No Country for Old Men"", etc.), but then I didn't really like others (""Argo"", ""The Godfather Part II""). However, ""Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)"" is definitely one of the Best Picture winners that I can say that I loved.PROS:Performances (Keaton, Stone, and Norton)CinematographyDark HumorThematic DepthSatire of HollywoodParallels with Real Hollywood Careers (specifically Keaton and Norton)CONS:Um........................................... none?",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

Second, When Riggan is daydreaming about all kind of action sequences (for me this is Key Scene) and finally, third, at the end of the movie when Riggan's daughter is looking for him at the hospital...In conclusion, it is a very good movie, with really good actors and a very complicated screenplay, BUT you have to wait...thats it!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

A worthy candle lit at both ends,"What isn't portrayed in this gorgeous picture when it comes to our current movie market which resembles theme parks as Scorsese calls them? Because bold films seem rarer than ever and the satire at the end shoves it right in our face, especially with multiple references to superhero flicks and actors throughout the film. And it shouldn't surprise us as our main character is a former such star. This isn't the first movie that goes into the depths behind an actor/ writer/ director's life behind the curtains. Riggan manages to fill all those shoes and is it a roller coaster from start to finish.The names of the performers speak for themselves and each of them puts on a great performance, but Keaton and Norton (even better given the perfectionist actor who lives only for the scene) are out of this world. Ironically, Keaton managed to reinvent himself as an actor at that time in 2014 with stellar moments, same as our character, but let's hope that he did not have to experience every bit of agonizing schizophrenic, depressed episodes as Riggan.A candle lit at both ends which does not let you, for one moment, get out of the director Iñárritu's world. Should you hate this selfish individual who values his ""career"" more than anything (which is more of a way passed star, not actorship as Lindsay Duncan's character mentions it at one point) as we see that in the first few minutes when his coworker suffers an unfortunate event. Or are we bound to take a better look into the mirror and see the ambitious, ready to risk it all, dream achiever person that may lurk inside of us?The cinematography is exceptional. The ""no cuts"" approach is getting less and less used these days and it was even more infrequent in 2014. Sure, it is no Boiling Point (2022), which is filmed in one single take for 90 minutes straight, but the transitions are perfect and every passing day builds the anxiety towards the premiere of Riggan's play. Even though most of the set is reused throughout and we see the character's play rehearsed multiple times, the smooth approach of the camera, the cozy or uneasiness inducing color palette, the constant off screen tension of the actors themselves preparing to rush to the next scene will make you beg for more. I also couldn't ask for a better score, it kept my heart pumping with every tune, drum beat or moment of silence.Am I labeling this and calling it brilliant like Riggan mocks the critic in the bar? Yes, I am! It is a a journey of crisis and transformation portrayed with great symbolism where our main character questions the true worth of his life, while battling colleagues, family, and friends who threaten his vision. Or is it all self induced by his powerful inner demons? Nevertheless, it is a movie which resonates with a lot of us who had a crisis (almost everybody) and you will laugh and get teary.

"Clever, enterprising and ambitious.","Going head to head with Boyhood for the Best Picture Oscar, this quirky meta-dramedy about a washed-up movie star attempting redemption on Broadway has generated much applause from critics around the world. It's not hard to see why, what with director Alejandro González Iñárritu's ambitious technical achievements, the razor sharp satirical screenplay and a bunch of soul-bearing performances. Presenting the story as one long continuous take, Iñárritu employs all the tricks of the trade in search of something unique and it largely pays off; his ever-flowing camera segues between scenes creating a dreamlike atmosphere. Finding where the shots have been joined, however, can at times distract from the emotional journey crafted by Iñárritu and his team of writers, in a script full of dark humour and irony. Unfortunately there's also a hint of pretension and self-satisfaction in Iñárritu's work – intentional and otherwise – that comes across as smug and, therefore, annoying. As Riggan Thomson, the former A-lister seeking professional rejuvenation on the stage, Michael Keaton gets a long- awaited opportunity to shine in a lead role and attacks it, for better and worse, with unbridled gusto. Ed Norton hogs the spotlight though, with a comedic turn as a supercilious stage actor looking for the ""truth"" in even the tiniest of things, whilst Emma Stone, Naomi Watts, Zach Galifianakis, Andrea Riseborough and Amy Ryan round out the impressive cast. Birdman is clever, enterprising and admirably distinct, if occasionally laborious and inaccessible; it's not for everyone, but lovers of film and/or theatre should seek it out.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Batman as a bird,"This movie was a whirlwind of themes and deeper meanings. Though I can understand why people would dislike it, I thoroughly enjoyed it.The film revolves around Michael Keaton's character, Riggan Thomas. Riggan is an actor who had a big role as Birdman, this role rocketed him to fame which died out in his later years. Riggan tried to rekindle his fame by making a broadway play that has a deep important to him. Though the risks he takes to make this play come to frutition are no light matter.The movie is very well directed. It is pretty and uses intriguing angles. The movie has a couple of themes it follows, one being the theme of wanting to be important and relevant. Keaton shows this feeling off so well. The film also shows what it's like to be an actor/actress. The film makes actors more human like. Gives us people we relate to. Though the biggest theme that I saw was the fear of not having a purpose. I think that is a fear everyone faces in their life. The movie expresses this theme so well, through their use of satire and the way they show Keaton and how he views things in the movie. The sound track, especially the drums suit the movie well.The characters were fascinating. Riggan obviously followed Michael Keaton and his life after playing the Batman. It was so interesting to see and feel how it must of felt. The other characters were fabulous. Adding a lot to the story. However Keatons performance really shined through.However I can see why people didn't love it. The satire parts of the movies such as Riggans powers, combined with the realism that the movie tackled was definitely an interesting take. The ending as well was an ending that can be interpreted in many ways. I personally saw it as the fall to insanity after trying so hard to be something, that it just loses its meaning.The movie was very well made.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Didn't understand it but loved it anyway,"5 February 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Birdman. I have to say that was one of the most bizarre films I have seen in a long long time........and I absolutely loved it. My cinema going chum said....'I can honestly say I didn't understand all of it'......and I have to agree with her, but it was an edgy, dark comedy which tackled it's demons full on and dragged you down with it. Michael Keaton plays Riggan Thomas, a once successful film actor who starred in a series of superhero movies. Turning his back on yet another lucrative sequel he is gambling his money, his family and his life producing, directing and starring in a play on Broadway. The whole of this film has that ""just off Broadway"" feel to it as each of the characters on and off the stage battle their demons and try to put on a brave face for the audience. Keaton's acting was supreme. You could openly see the turmoil within his character as he tried to overcome the malevolence being fed constantly into his ear by his alter ego. Although this is a whole new character for him, I have to point out that in one particular bar scene I definitely espied that insane white faced Beetlejuice. Don't go and watch this film expecting to come out revitalised, and clear about what you saw, because you will not......come out of it having witnessed a phenomenon, and some very clever acting.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"Probably the worst of the recent ""best.""","Curious isn't it? Lots of people say they love it but I have no idea why. Michael Keaton was, apparently, a box office superhero star. He seeks to authenticate his life by making a Broadway hit on stage. It seems that what he had before was somehow lacking and caused him to fail both his wife and daughter. A part of him, characterized by a voice from within, keeps wanting to lure him back to fame and fortune. Another part of him, (rather less clearly cast), suggests that he is genuinely possessed of super powers, (telekinesis and the ability to fly at the very least). The film itself, partly driven by the Broadway play which both advances and reflects its themes, staggers between massive issues about love of family, artistic integrity and, crucially, being true to yourself, without examining any of them adequately. All the characters are little more than sketches and, given that this is precisely what Keaton is seeking to redress, the result is disappointing. If this film was really an artistically dressed up version of the idea that the abandonment of family and clutching at fantasy amounts to being washed up, it succeeds in stating the obvious. If it's about the difficulty to be found in recovering from such losses by regaining the love of those who matter (including love of self) it simply fails to gel. None of the characters is sufficiently developed for the viewer to be able to say very much about them or what it is that they might find lovable. There's a wife, there's a daughter, there's a movie critic, there are some fellow actors and there are some incidentals including Keaton's ""best"" friend. I watched the film in silence and felt a cloud descending. It didn't lift and I had no idea who anyone was. That can't have been the aim.....can it?",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

A weird and beautiful master work of art.,"Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) (2014) is a cluster of film genres that blend together so seamlessly in this tale of a retired superhero actor who writes, directs, and stars in a play to show the world that he isn't just that one guy in that kid movie as he deals with his substance abusing daughter, his ex wife, a brilliant but offensive method actor, his cast, and his own voice in his head telling him to f the world and make Birdman 4. It's a film that's so real in its stars performances but so dream-like in its cinematography and directing being edited to look like there was no edits in a beautiful ""one-shot"" filming style. The performances are literal perfection, the style has a lot of substance, and the ending is an ambiguous delight. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Looking into the soul with a fine toothed comb,"I honestly don't care what people have said or what reports have come from the Hollywood press stating this film was not a carefully tailored tale about Michael Keaton's career. The denials are everywhere, and there is a plenty of people in this world that will believe the coincidence that Keaton was merely chosen for this film due to the logical conclusion he would be the perfect actor for the project. Poppycock. Balderdash. Any and all other old timey British phrases of incredulity.Michael Keaton was really the only person on the planet that could play this role. Before the ridiculous times we live in where a comic book character could be considered a ""prestige"" role, it was something of a career killer back in the day. Patrick Stewart will always be Jean-Luc Picard or Mark Hamill will always be Luke Skywalker. Keaton, a quirky comic actor in the 80s was an odd choice for the role back in 1989, and now he is routinely called the best of all the Batmans in the comic book universe. With this role, Keaton became hard to cast. Sure, he had some movies every now and then but he could never shake off the Batman role. So when a movie confronting the artistic integrity of a man that was pigeon holed into one iconic role was casting, Keaton was the perfect man for the job. Not only does it seem like an honest opinion of the actor in the film, it is an honest opinion of Keaton himself. If you are old enough to understand just how much the Batman affected Keaton's acting career, then you will definitely understand the pain he is experiencing in the movie.I couldn't get enough of how much Keaton had to look in the mirror to not believe some of the things coming out of his mouth. The meta commentary on his life would have been one thing, but the way the film is shot and structured gives more gravitas to the underlying message. Popularity is one thing, but how far will you go for artistry? What do you have to do shake off the past?Right now, just about everyone in Hollywood wants that comic book money regardless of the artistically vacuous subject matter the movies try to showcase. There is so many of them now that actors can disappear into multiple roles and fans wonder why so-and-so actor has not been in a comic book/Star Wars property yet. The word ""typecast"" might as well be removed from the dictionary now that anyone can escape into some off beat role whether it be film or television due to the mountains of streaming services available. As for Keaton, the glimpse into his soul paid off, even if the academy got it wrong for not giving him an acting Oscar for this, he now has some new appeal and a new surge in his career. He is no longer ""Batman"" in the eyes of many, but ""Oscar winning actor"" to the general public. I would say that is a fair trade-off.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"Sankara, or inner city jazz","Hollywood just loves views of itself; and when coupled with aging actors having to cope with fame in histrionic performance and some obvious wizardry in the camera it gets everyone up from their seats to festoon with awards. That's fine. Funny however, Welles was once upon time ostracized for much the same thing in Kane.But that's half the story. The other half is that this is much more cinematic and layered than several winners of late. I like this. Whereas Argo and King's Speech were competent at best, this aspires to mastery. To go deep into the stuff that keep us awake.This is about one such man kept awake at nights by where he fits in the narratives of life, rendered as an aging actor wandering in and out of a performance he struggles to bring to life over the course of a few days, one that caps off a lifetime and leaves behind something worth recalling. The place is a theater but more broadly the stage of dreams.This layer of the film yields the obvious; satire about the business of having to live with and up to an image, Caine playing himself as the man who used to be Batman, snarling and throwing things. Some more commentary about the mechanisms that control a fickle culture; the journalist who controls the fate of a show by what story she writes, people stuck with the familiar image in mind (Batman).That's all readily available, simple essaying. There's something more important to glean further inside however, more deeply about our place in the midst of images.We're all actors like him (or so we think), going out on stage every day to wring truth out of role. We're all like him constantly wading through inner narratives we sustain around us, with desires and aversions that summon things to us or push them back. (Mental formations)(Now we see the difference with films like Batman and others, that show us a flawed hero who crisply walks through some dramatic arc. Oh he may look pained or confused in spots, but the overarching gaze is always solid, we're in full control as viewers. In actual life, we fully undergo the pain or loss of control ourselves, have our narratives shuffled in surreal ways)The place is a theater as said. Some of the most marvelous occasions are when we walk onto that stage and find ourselves slipping from real to fiction, or in the middle of a performance a spontaneous fire makes the narrative rattle. Norton's fiery interruption about his gin being replaced.That's all fine, great in other hands. But even further inside I encounter the specific maker who made this, who can't help coloring everything else, creating it in his image. See, I was surprised to read near universal acclaim for this, knowing it comes by a filmmaker associated with histrionics in previous films.A contrast forms. The best account I can give is this.With a ""soft"" eye that doesn't dwell in particulars and feels the deeper undercurrents as they rise and subside, I sense the pull of oceanic power. The shifts from real to fiction to real that show truth to be a matter of illusory context. The improvised truth intruding into fiction and slippery ground it creates. The rhythm of the cuts and the shift of views, the whole instrumentation is often marvelous to see.But the froth that ripples the surface, the tumult these currents create when they reach the narrative surface closer to us, the emotional splashing of inner conflict from the mouths of actors, these show a histrionic sensibility. The life we get that has to face age and loss becomes tantrum, actorly splashing around in the shallow instead of swimming out to sea.These are two different modes of conveyance. One soft, wants to evoke and float. The other hard, thrashes about and fights to come up for air. The first evokes some of Altman's improvised jazz. The other PT Anderson's attempts to play much the same music but laboring and hitting the notes too stridently.I want to say that Lubezcki had a lot to do with the former (who practiced next to Mann, Malick, and Cuaron, all preeminently visual makers) but it may just be Innaritu has both intuition and the urge to overstate.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Best Movie of 2014,This movie was excellent. It's easily my favorite movie of 2014 and it deserves every price it gets.The best thing about it was that the whole film is cheated to look like it was taken in one shot. This was a great choice for several reasons. Because the movie is about actors performing a play and you actually see them doing their performances i got dangerously close to constantly reminding myself that i'm just watching actors playing a role. But the fact that you never see a cut as well as the really great performances prevented me from doing so and i got sucked right into it. The other reason is that some methods used in a theatrical production like quickly changing costumes between scenes are also most likely being used in this movie because you can't really tell where the cuts are placed.I found it also great that there are not many locations. The majority takes place in a theater and you see a lot what's going on Backstage. Other places are parts of the Broadway and a bar. Aside from that there where some other locations but the characters do not stay there very long. Most of the time we are just in the theater seeing the characters preparing the play and i'm glad that this decision was made.The movie also had a great sense of humor. The film never tries to rub the jokes in you face but they are very well placed and the overall pacing and directing was very good. It also criticized a lot about modern movie going audiences and modern blockbusters in general.The only thing that distracted me a little was that some parts are really predictable but aside from that nothing bothered me at all and i'm still going to give this movie a perfect rating.,10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

The perfect pairing of Alejandro González Iñárritu and Emmanuel Lubezki have made an entrancing masterpiece. The skill of the camerawork dwarfs The Revenant, and though uses a limited set makes it entertaining and engaging throughout. The harsh neon colour palette catalyses the insanity of Birdman. The jazz accompaniment gave me jazz fever which was enrapturing as I danced along with the film's rhythmic ferocity. The humour was tasteful, the script was beguiling in its utter randomness.

Michael Keaton came to play,"I happened to catch BIRDMAN just a bit ago, for those of you who don't know about it or even for those who just saw the trailer and were still a little confused, Birdman is an art-house flick written and directed by one of the new heavies of Hollywood Alejandro González Iñárritu, of 21 Grams, Babble and Biutiful fame. The movie stars Michael Keaton as an aging actor living in the shadow of his past glories and his attempts to reignite his career with a Broadway play that he believes will help him prove to himself and the world that he's not just another flash in the pan Hollywood star.It's kind of hard to know where to start with this movie because there is a lot going on in it and all of it is noteworthy. For starters, the story is really interesting as it seems to be written SPECIFICALLY for Michael Keaton about his experience since playing the famous caped crusader from Gotham City. The movie plays in a very art-house cinema sort of way incorporating sharp dialog with surreal visual elements that keep your mind working to figure out how the show is going to play out. This experience is fueled by performances by Edward Norton, Emma Stone, Naomi Watts (all of which have been in comic book movies... Yes, even Naomi Watts, remember Tank Girl? You don't? Well I guess it's just the same because it wasn't very good anyway) as well as a startlingly good performance by Zach Galifinakis! It's really interesting following Keaton and the cast throughout this film and the semi-surreal nature of it really keeps you glued to your seat and wondering what is going to happen next. Will Keaton grow wings or will he buy a pack of gum? Who knows?! And that's really the appeal of this film. It's a kind of original film making that hasn't been seen on a big screen since the late 1970s which is really refreshing.I really enjoyed this movie and it is sure to garner a few golden statue nominations including Best Original Screenplay and maybe a Best Actor nomination for Keaton and honestly, it would be well deserved. If you do see this movie, here is a tip, don't let the trailer trick you into thinking it's a artsy superhero movie, IT TOTALLY ISN'T but don't let that dissuade you from going to check it out because It's in my top 10 this year. Birdman gets a 4.5...out of 5.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"Great direction, disappointing content","Although this movie is revolutionary, introducing the concept of non stop action which, in my point view, was designed greatly by Alejandro for this, the film itself lacks depth and meaning. The characters were badly explored and the story is minimum, giving more concern to the connection between scenes which show us constantly stairs or empty corridors turning the movie a little bland.However, the concept is interesting and the film presents a great soundtrack capable of pumping everyone, that turns this movie more pleasant to watch and easier to digest.

I recognise that it is arty in the way it's filmed which I liked but I wouldn't rate it up there with the films you *must* watch in a year... that said, I enjoyed watching it so nothing wrong with that.If you're looking for something entertaining and a bit different to watch one evening, then give this a try.Additional: apparently I have to write a bit more for a valid review, so here it comes. The start of the film I didn't really know what was going on... it presented an interesting view of the ""theatre"" industry which I quite liked - I still don't know if it's true but it's an interesting insight (mildly backed up by what you may think).As the film develops, I became more accustomed to the way it's shot, which I'd found a bit random at the start, however I came to like at the end - the way the scenes merge together (that'll make sense if you see it). I thought it was arty and the would be director in me enjoyed it.I never quite got the story but for me that didn't matter. The ending left me satisfied and I hope that others feel the same.I'm not sure if the film is meant to be supernatural or not - I guess that's for each to decide but I liked the way it was presented.As above though, just sit back and enjoy it for what it is (oh, and not forgetting all the awards so you should watch it!).",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

"Probably More Clever than Profound, but Certainly Fun","When I saw Rope, which Alfred Hitchcock famously filmed as though it were one continuous take, I was disappointed, because the continuous take effect wasn't nearly as cool as I expected. Decades later, Birdman does it right. The entire movie is filmed as one long take, with the camera swooping and gliding and wandering about. Not only is it cool, but it doesn't feel like a pure cinematic trick, but rather a technique to create a sense of claustrophobia and chaos, and to allow actors long, intimate, intense scenes.The basic story is straightforward enough - has been Hollywood Star Michael Keaton attempt to storm Broadway and experiences various disasters and personality conflicts - but the movie asks you to question everything you see from the beginning, when Keaton is seen floating in mid-air. The question of whether Keaton is supernatural is soon joined by questions of whether this movie is seriously presenting worn out tropes like a brilliant, destructive actor or a vindictive, all-powerful theater critic or whether everything in the movie is actually a mental projection.While the plot lives in a strange reality, it is counter-balanced with very grounded performances. The cast is excellent, particularly Ed Norton as the brilliant destructive actor and even more so Emma Stone as Keaton's angry daughter.The is this real or not vibe is most reminiscent of the brilliant TV series Wilfred, but overall the movie seems like a mix of Living in Oblivion and Black Swan, two entertainment-industry movies that toy with reality.It's not, for me, quite as good as either of those. Yes, it's brilliantly acted and clever as all get-out, but I'm not sure the movie really has much to say; it feels like it just wants to impress you with its cleverness, and while it does, I wish I felt there was something more to it.All the same, it's a really interesting movie, and a must-see for fans of cinematography, for which it deservedly won an Oscar.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

So human... it becomes more than interesting.You'll want to know more but you can't, because it portrays life so deep and life doesn't give answer to every curiosity.

The Virtue of Bemused Bewilderment,"Has Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu reinvented himself through Michael Keaton? The director of films known more for their universally- connected narratives, ensemble casts and flashy but suffocating visual styles has kept only the flash and instead gone small-scale and intimate. Yet, even in reinventing his narrative methods, he has still maintained certain personal elements that keep one from being able to pin down exactly what type of movie Birdman is. At times, you may feel as if you have the rest of the film figured out, only for Iñárritu to do a near-180 spin that leaves you thinking about why and whether or not it works. Then again, whether it works or not may be a moot point when it comes to this director.Every once in awhile, fate or some other external force graces film- goers with a pleasant experience by permitting circumstances to wed a particular actor with a particular role. Whether poetic justice comes into play is still to be determined, but few would be able to see the casting of Michael Keaton as a former blockbuster star attempting to reinvent his career on Broadway as anything but a marvelously innovative notion. Aside from noting the obvious imitations of art into life with Keaton's history as Batman, it is interesting to study how Keaton is able to unravel himself as an actor with more capabilities and dimensions than any of his previous roles have allowed him. He embraces age, the thinning hair exposing his round forehead, the facial hair sporadically spread over his face like vegetation in the desert. Aside from his brief tenure as the Dark Knight, Keaton has always seemed a marginalized actor; a familiar face but not noteworthy as a bona-fide star. This judgment no longer holds true.As much of a revelation as Keaton is, he may have the dubious misfortune to be in the same movie as Edward Norton, whose interpretation of a method actor incapable of leading any semblance of a real life without resorting to thespian techniques is an astonishing triumph. Norton has always been understood to be a massively talented actor who for whatever reason has kept his talent to a smaller pool of roles which, nevertheless, have become indelible for many since he burst onto the screen 18 years ago. In some ways, this role mirrors his own career in much the same way as Keaton's does. Still, nothing has prepared us for this kind of Norton intensity. He is at once vain, empathetic, sweet and cruel. Such a memorable performance can be undone, however, if the film's focus becomes distracted and we lose sight of a great supporting role, which seems to be the case here. The last 20 minutes become completely about Keaton, yet our interest in Mike Shiner has only increased, leading us to be incredulous as to the conclusion of his importance. What exactly was it supposed to be? And are we supposed to ignore these feelings while following Riggan Thomson down his path of enlightenment?If this sounds like criticism of the director's capabilities, it is more a questioning of his intentions. There can be little doubt regarding Iñárritu's talent as a director. Indeed, his ability to utilize the illusion of one continuous take throughout the whole film seems like a cheap gimmick at first, though eventually we become used to its effect, which is never overtly flashy or self- conscious. In many ways, you cannot help but be amazed at how much Iñárritu is able to fit into each frame, considering how often it fluctuates. Still, its actual effect will puzzle some viewers. What is its intended purpose other than to show off Iñárritu's ability as well as the intimate setting, in front and behind the curtain, of a Broadway play? Some have claimed it breaks down filmic barriers in order to bring the audience closer to the actors as they relate to their surroundings but the effect has little to do with its practicality.For all its technical prowess and intense acting, Birdman at its most bleakly poignant remains a well-tread tale of a man who put his career before family and relationships. Such themes add nothing new to the experience of watching the story of a man attempting to redeem himself but Iñárritu's methods are convincingly overwhelming. One critic described the film as ""vacuous virtuosity."" If ever there was a label for mixed feelings this would be it, and Birdman would be that movie.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Going to have to let this one roll around in my head for a while,"I'm not really sure what to think of ""Birdman"". I know this was supposed to be a juicy role for Michael Keaton (and it is), but didn't know what to expect beyond that. The cast is remarkable, that's for sure (Keaton owns here), and I do like the jazz drums score. The long takes were interesting and I appreciated the work that goes into them, the high levels of coordination, but the camera just couldn't sit still. I have the same problem with J.J. Abrams, but didn't think that'd happen with ""Birdman"" as well. On the plus side, this movie made creative use of the referential humor. Usually, when something is being meta, it's glaringly obvious. But here, it's actually funny.This isn't ""Gone Girl"" underwhelming, but perplexed is the best word to describe my reaction.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
A Celebration of the Art of Acting,"Birdman is a cinematic masterpiece. It's a celebration of the long continuous shot, and a celebration of acting.These kinds of movies, with long scenes of very long dialogues to remember really blow my mind. The interplay with other actors' lines, characters often switching back and forth between their in-movie character and the character of the stage play they portray...to not only remember it all but to be so convincing and real/natural. It's truly mesmerizing.The ""negatives"" ..The acting is often hammed up, not just the parts of the in-movie stage play, but the real world characters in the movie.The incessant drumbeat soundtrack is a nice idea, but it is mixed way too loud, making it difficult to hear what the actors are saying thruout the film.All the actors do a great job, but it's Michael Keaton's time to shine. I've always liked him as an actor, he's very underrated and seldom gets recognition for his great range. In Birdman, tho, he's a tour de force, his talents undeniable.Birdman is a must-watch, and should be on every cinephile's bucket-list...but it is a film that is there more for the appreciation of film-making and acting than it is a film to live vicariously and lose yourself in the story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"Great acting, technically accomplished and lots of jet black humor","A washed up big screen actor mounts a Broadway show as a comeback vehicle and with this loon in charge of production, things go hilariously off the wall. Keaton does fantastic work here as a man desperately clinging to the need to be relevant again and is tortured and occasionally guided by the voice and powers of Birdman. As opening night gets closer, the stress sends Riggan into a tailspin of unhinged behavior - his play might be an embarrassment, an actor keeps sabotaging previews by getting drunk and trashing the set or having an erection on stage, his daughter fresh out of rehab hates his guts, his kind of girlfriend might be pregnant, he's burning through all of his cash on this play and the most powerful critic wants to kill his play on the principle of who he is. It's not easy being a self absorbed lunatic, who once played an iconic superhero. Occasionally Birdman can meander and by the film's conclusion, every actor has their scene to emote and while a few of those can feel a little episodic, there's always enough humor and wit to overcome any bumps along the way. Norton in particular is a standout who is hilarious as a difficult actor. Designed to be one long unbroken shot, occasionally it feels like a gimmick, but more often than not, the cinematography feels invisible. Most of the camera work feels spontaneous and the focus pulling is as accomplished as the seamless edits. Birdman is an odd and original work with some jet black humor throughout and a fully committed cast makes this always fascinating to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

The performances were great all around, I really could have used a bit more Zachary Galifinakis however, he can hold his own in serious roles when he needs to. A bit more blanchette would have been nice as well. It was great seeing Michael Keaton back in form being not only hilarious but showing real depth to his character arc.

We all have a secret 'inner life'?,"I did not see this back when it was in theaters.... I finally watched 'Birdman' for the 1st time just last week. And good I waited.
Think I appreciate the story and the main character, played expertly by Michael Keaton, now, as I can relate to the struggles he was going through. I'm not an actor, and have no allusions to 'Fame', even the 15-minute variety that artist Andy Warhol once spoke of... But, being a near senior citizen, the trials and tribulations of anyone that is over 'a certain age' is something that I, and anyone in that era of life, that also likes a thoughtful AND entertaining story/film, surely can relate to....
We might all not have an 'inner voice' that insults us, and eggs us on to 'Do Better' (while said voice appears, now and then, visibly - and, wearing a super hero suit), but we are fallible, sometimes (often) ego-driven creatures.... and simply just want to know we are loved (lovable?) and appreciated - as we go faster and faster through this often hectic, and at times crazy & stressful existence, on this tiny speck floating in an immense and indifferent universe!
This film is both fascinating and a bit perplexing, so I will have to watch it a second and third time... very soon. But, if you like watching odd & unusual types of films: one that has humor, occasional fantasy & action, and social commentary - and especially, if you enjoy the underrated and excellent acting of Mr. Michael Keaton - then 'Birdman' just might be the film for you?

The second half most momentum,"This film tells the story of a then famous actor who wants to regain credibility by creating his own Broadway adaptation of a play. The run-up to the opening is plagued by problems.When I realised that the film appeared to be shot in one take, my interest in it got heightened. I kept looking for spots where there could have been a break in filming. This interest didn't last until the end, however, because I only found the first half of the film interesting.The first half tells a convincing story of what happens in a Broadway production. All the actors give great performances, even Emma Stone whom I didn't realise acted so well. How the camera flows from one scene to another is quite an experience.The second half of the story gets confusing. The story focuses on the downfall of the lead character. It takes on surrealism, or hallucinations; the exact nature is open to debate. Instead of increasing my interest, I had decreased interest in the film because it is confusing and strays so much from the first half of the story. I thought the momentum from the first half is lost.Overall, I would still watch ""Birdman"", mainly for the great continuous shot and for the actors performances.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Not as good when revisited,"Once the novelty of seeing Michael Keaton playing someone who played a superhero un the movies wears off, there is not too much more this film has to offer. It's worth to see Michael Keaton's performance and he is mostly why this still gets a positive rating.The story is about an actor seeking to find his true identity as a performer, father and husband after learning he has been a bit of a caricature of all three most of his adult life. The story ends up being mostly about self acceptance and it doesn't offer much beyond just that. The subplots are forgettable and frankly, most stories revolving around the theater are pretty boring.There are some darkly comic moments but not enough. I watched this again for the first time in years and I felt like i was watchung something that wasn't fleshed out and fully realized as a compelling story. It's unfortunate. Still, 7 stars for Michael Keaton. He clearly was playing someone he wasn't despite playing an actor. Or I should say he is a good actor playing one who isn't so good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
A Cinematic Triumph of Innovation and Artistry,"Michael Keaton as Riggan Thomson, a former superhero actor trying to reinvent himself on Broadway. This role is a brilliant nod to Keaton's own past as Batman, adding a rich layer of irony and depth to the story.The film's standout feature is its cinematography, which creates the illusion of a single continuous shot. Emmanuel Lubezki's work here is nothing short of extraordinary, pulling viewers right into the chaotic and immersive world of Riggan's life. It's a visual feast that keeps you engaged from start to finish.Keaton delivers an incredible performance, blending vulnerability and desperation perfectly. The supporting cast-Edward Norton, Emma Stone, and Naomi Watts-are equally impressive, adding layers of complexity and humor to the narrative.Iñárritu's direction, paired with a smart and witty script, tackles themes of relevance, ego, and artistic struggle with both humor and poignancy. Antonio Sánchez's drum score adds a unique and intense rhythm to the film, enhancing its distinctive style.Overall, ""Birdman"" is a triumph of creativity and innovation in modern cinema. It's thought-provoking, visually stunning, and packed with standout performances. If you're looking for a film that's bold, unique, and deeply engaging, ""Birdman"" is a must-watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
The parts are greater than the sum,"Well, so the Academy awarded BIRDMAN Best Picture of the Year. Strange choice but perhaps it means that the Academy is taking a different look at Indie- type films instead of the all too huge glut of Marvel comics (though there are certainly elements of that in this movie – the main character does fly solo over NYC and moves objects with a flick of the wrist etc) and potty mouth dialogue (though there is considerable of that in this film, also) and rehab druggie overtones (though that too is part of the story).The acting is very fine from the entire cast, the cinematography is interestingly claustrophobic in the St. James Theater (except for the sci-fi elements outside), and the story has some solid philosophical bits about family, parenting, hopes, dreams, delusions, etc. All good.Much of the dialogue is buried in what has to be one of the most irritating soundtracks ever created. Individually the constant drumming bit is well done – if it weren't competing with the story or the dialogue. The excerpts from Mahler's Symphony No. 9 and the Rückert-Lieder excerpt 'Ich bin der Welt abhanden gekommen', Tchaikovsky's Symphony No 5, Rachmaninov's Symphony No. 2, John Adams' Prologue from 'The Death of Klinghoffer, and Ravel's Passacaille movement from his Piano Trio– all gorgeous and well performed by various groups – simply made no tangential sense, fought with the drumming, and again covered the dialogue.But, this was an experimental movie and as such was a breath of fresh air to be even considered for an Oscar. As for the participants, Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, Emma Stone, Naomi Watts, Andrea Riseborough, Zach Galifianakis, Natalie Gold, and Merritt Wever and, of course, writer/director Alejandro G. Iñárritu all are in top form. Maybe on the big screen it doesn't appear so dissociative.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

A Unique Experience To Say The Least,"Birdman is unlike any movie I've ever seen before and that's the highest praise I could give a movie and is one of the reasons I love it so much. One thing I loved about this film was the way it was directed, I've always loved watching long, on stake shots but expanding it out across an entire movie is something that never crossed my mind and I loved it, it just gave this film a flow that allowed it to be perfectly paced and is possibly one of the best directed movies I've ever seen. The way this film views the modern film industry is fantastic, it's not done in an insulting way but in a way that allows the viewer to think upon other big blockbusters. Michael Keaton is amazing in this movie, I've always liked him as an actor but he's never really blown me away until this film, he was able to draw from his own life experience to add to his performance and is overall just a unique performance. You really felt for his character you understood why it was so important for this play to work out for him. Edward Norton is one of my favourite actors and this is easily one of his best performances, not only does he succeed at being a scumbag but he's also able to bring a humanity to his character that makes him more compelling, like Keaton you understand completely why he is the way he is. Emma Stone has really grown on me in recent year but I've never seen her like this, it's a completely disgusting character but it's not needless, you understand her past experiences and why she is the way she is, Stones now famous monologue in this film blew me away, my jaw was on the floor and eyes were glued to the screen. This movie is very interpretative and I liked that about this film. You don't completely understand what is going on and the choice of leaving an open ending really made me want to go back and watch it again to try and form your own theories and understand better. This film also does great things with its characters, the reason all the performances Birdman are so good is because there all developed perfectly, they all have great backstories and reasons for their attitudes.To be honest I don't really have any flaws with this movie, I can't explain it but I just can give this film a 10. But it doesn't change the fact that I love this film. I admired how it tried to be different, I loved all the character and performances. It perfectly and paced and directed and I believe that this is one of those films that everybody, film fan or not, should experience at least once in their lifetime.91%/A",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

"'Birdman' Flies, But it Doesn't Soar","'Birdman' is without question a technical marvel that should be seen by anyone serious about film making. The cinematography is groundbreaking, I wouldn't be surprised if it were to spark a new wave of films trying to capture those magical moments of following actors around, while delivering lines for up to 10-15 minutes at a time. And of course the actors are completely up to the challenge, they give some very strong performances, especially Keaton (I think only Foxcatcher's Steve Carell can rival his performance for Best Actor). But while the movie had all of these fantastic technical achievements (acting, production design, and cinematography), the storyline seemed just a tad derivative for me. When I say that, I mean the classic, 'a has been is giving it one last shot at fame', but instead of the common sports story theme, its about an acting career. I think people are giddy over the fact that the movie basically describes Keaton's acting career and are giving the film slightly too much praise for that sole reason, had it been a different actor playing Riggan, the results would (in my mind) be less spectacular. When all is said and done, the movie didn't have much 'excitement' or 'thrills', it certainly had its moments, but not a strong driving force that kept me on the edge of my seat waiting for the next scene to come.And as a final thought, 'Birdman' really got me reminiscing about, 'Black Swan' and 'The Wrestler', I won't list the similarities, but there are plenty of them (especially between 'Black Swan'). I prefer both of those films when compared to 'Birdman', I think they feature stronger central characters. But my point is that i'm unsure as to whether its a good thing that 'Birdman' inspired me to recollect my thoughts of similar movies and compare the bunch, or it was an unfortunate sin, because it took my thoughts away from 'Birdman'.Full Review At: www.simplefilmreviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

The best choice for academy award...FIANALLY,"I was strolling down and reading some of the users' reviews when I faced some really negative ones and as I read their ideas, I wasn't convinced to lower my rating at all. I think some of the movie goers here are only capable of viewing a movie at face value.
First of all, let's be clear about the ONE SHOT thing. To my mind, it wasn't boring at all! It was something new that I had never experienced before and I think that's one of the reasons this spectacular picture stands out forever.
And about the cast, some were of the opinion that there was too much acting of them and most of their performances were overacted. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! I don't get how an furious girl shouting at his dad about their issues could be considered as OVERACTED! Or an anxious director going wild over a theatre critic again known as OVERACTED?!
Regarding music, not being as exciting as a Hans Zimmer masterpiece, it had its specialty as seldom can it be found in other movies. That's what we are looking for! Something new.

Hardest Film To Review Of The Year,"I think I have to review this film in two parts. Personally, I disliked it massively. I've watched all the nominees for best picture this year and this is my least favourite. The plot just didn't seem to go anywhere, I couldn't have cared less about the characters and their predicaments. I think Michael Keaton's performance has been hugely over-rated. As a dime a dozen movie-goer, I just didn't get it. However, this film has Academy fodder written all over it. I can definitely see why this film has sweeped awards this year. Edward Norton, Emma Stone and Zak Galifinakis were very good and the direction was also very Academy pleasing with many scenes done in just one shot. So, personally, I've ticked it off my list and I'll never be watching it again, but I'm not so naïve to not recognise it as a feat of cinematography. I certainly think its a movie made to try and win awards rather than for the likes of me to go and have a good time at the cinema.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Alenjandro 's Philosophy,"The first time we see Michael Keaton in his tighty-whities in ""Birdman,"" it's from behind. His character, a formerly high-flying movie star, is sitting in the lotus position in his dressing room of a historic Broadway theatre, only he's levitating above the ground. Bathed in sunlight streaming in from an open window, he looks peaceful. But a voice inside his head is growling, grumbling, gnawing at him grotesquely about matters both large and small.It's powerfully clear that they all worked their asses of to make this complicated thrill ride look effortless. The result is one of the best times you'll have at the movies this year–which might even be the best movie this year.I have now started finding better movies through www.flickstree.com.

Just know what you're getting into,"Before I give my review, I'd like to explain some of the hate this film has been getting. Many people hated this film because they thought it was boring and artsy. Some people went into this film thinking it would be a superhero films (which it is not what so ever). If you go into this film thinking it's anything other than what it really is, chances are you'll hate it. Birdman is a drama, and it could be a satirical comedy if you are a movie or theater buff. It follows a man trying to revive his career as an actor into becoming a play director and actor played by Michael Keaton. Michael brings in the best performance of his career, as well as Emma Stone, who plays his Daughter. Edward Norton, who plays a theater actor also gives an excellent performance. This movie can do everything a movie is supposed to do. And it might sound cliché but you can laugh, cry, feel good, and learn something new. The film is put together to look like it was all filmed in one shot. This makes sense seeing as the film is about a theater production and Theater has not cuts or editing. But this film isn't only about a theater production, this is a film about critics, movies, superhero movies, actors and actresses, life. This is essentially a movie about everything, the ultimate movie. Birdman has excellent performances, a great story, amazing camera-work, and legendary direction from Alejandro Gonzalez Iñaritu and this one is totally deserving of it's 9/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

Good But Certainly No Masterpiece,"I can't help but feel that Birdman is going to be one of the most over rated movies of the year if not the decade because the critics are praising this film far beyond what it deserves, which is a shame.Fact of the matter is that I found Birdman to be quite good but no more than that, the cast is good, the performances are very good, the idea is pretty original and it's certainly something we don't see very often so that's refreshing. There are a number of pretty funny scenes as well which keep you going but ultimately there are plenty of flaws which won't appeal to the casual cinema goer.I found the script in general to be a little weak, I can't think of any particularly brilliant quotes from the movie and if it's supposed to be a comedy I heard only sporadic laughter in the cinema over the course of 120mins. Now I'm not generally a fan of ridiculous comedies like the Scary Movie saga but if that's your thing then stay well away from Birdman. Also I found the background drums soundtrack to be a little over used and irritating by times and the emotional scenes I found to be a little out of place and boring, particularly Emma Stone's.The ending is a little bit bizarre as well but I suppose that was to be expected considering the arty nature of the film, but again I found it weak rather than powerful, amusing or even significant.So to conclude, I think this is more a movie for the critics, arty people and the middle aged who've experienced success and failure so can relate to the story more than younger people. That's not to say don't go to see Birdman, it is worth watching but don't be fooled by the reviews, it's nowhere near as good as the critics are saying.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Very enjoyable film,"I loved this film.

[20/20],"Common knowledge would have you believe that 'Inception', 'Mad Max: Fury Road', 'Django Unchained', 'Toy Story 3' and 'The Wolf of Wall Street' are the five best films of the 2010s so far. Whilst I don't think that any of those choices are bad films ('Fury Road' and 'Toy Story 3' in particular are great), I'm always left wondering as to why this masterpiece is left out of so many people's lists.I don't like that word 'masterpiece', I think modern audiences associate it too often with good, not great films. I use it lightly, this is one of only four other films released since 2010 that I associate that word with.I watched this film on DVD recently after it came out... loved it.

I had heard mild rumblings online that a sizeable percentage of audience members were not impressed with it.I decided to write this review after watching a video online. I won't mention who released it but three competitors were asked ""Which bad film, did the critics love"". The three options the competitors gave were 'Citizen Kane', 'Snowpiercer' and 'Birdman'. Three great films. The thing is, after the 90 minute video, I still couldn't understand why the American didn't like 'Birdman' (or the other two films for that matter). However, I can think of several reasons why 'Birdman' was a masterpiece.1) It's bloomin' beautiful. You'll probably struggle to find anyone who doesn't believe that the mostly one take camera movement that Alejandro G. Iñárritu decided upon didn't look great. The problem the American had with this technique is that ""why is it made to look like on take!?"". Why not? Not only does it look fantastic, it also keeps the narrative flowing at a great pace and perfectly shows what it's like to work at a West End theatre, it's cramped, everythings two feet away from everything else backstage and Iñárritu used the camera to show this space.2) The performances are great. No, they are. Everyone loves Michael Keaton, never trust anyone who doesn't like Michael Keaton. I do like Eddie Redmayne and I thought his performance in 'The Theory of Everything' was phenomenal. But I feel like the little gold man belonged to Keaton that year. The Americans main problem in the acting department was Emma Stone... he still didn't give me a good enough reason why. Credit where it's due, Stone was great because she was the only member of the cast who had to properly act. Keaton, Norton, Watts and etc were all great in this film, but I did feel that they were playing exaggerated versions of themselves (that's not a complaint btw). Stone was the only member of the cast who I felt as though was not playing herself, but was adapting to a character who doesn't share to many similar traits. That's good acting.3) The story is great. Another one of the American's complaints was the story. He said, the story and the characters fell flat. Mate... they just didn't. As my Art teacher once said ""You could look at a red box and say to yourself 'it's blue, it's blue, it's blue' but at the end of the day it's not, it's red"". You can look at the story and say ""The story fell flat, the story fell flat, the story fell flat"", but at the end of the day... it just didn't. It is literally said in the film ""People, they love blood. They love action. Not this talky, depressing, philosophical b******t."" Iñárritu literally talked to the audience. The rough translation is ""People don't want to think when they see a film anymore"". As the reaction of ""passive audience"" members proved, this statement is corrected.I think the reason why a lot of people write off this film is because they can't be asked to think and get hold of the meaning. I think the reason films like 'Django Unchained' and 'The Wolf of Wall Street' are considered by many two of the best films of the 2010s is because you don't have to think to hard to watch them (I don't like either film, but I like DiCaprio btw). Their good films, but neither are masterpieces.2014 was, overall, a great year for films. 'Whiplash' = great, 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' = great, 'Nightcrawler' = great. We also got 'Boyhood', 'Gone Girl', 'The Babadook', 'The LEGO Movie'. Speaking of ""Talky, depressing, philosophical b******t"", we got some of the best, well made and most heartfelt summer action blockbusters in a long time in the form of 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' and 'Guardians of the Galaxy' (the latter of which being the MCU's best film). However, as far as I'm concerned 'Birdman' is the king of the castle, the leader of the pack, the rightful Best Picture winner.As far as i'm concerned, 'Birdman' is one of the best films of the 2010s so far, maybe even the best. And considering there is only nine months left of the 2010s, I think it's going to stay that way.(BTW- If you didn't like this film, but do like explodey-wodey, mindless action films... at least have the decency to admit that you're a ""passive"" audience member).",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Innarritu is masterful as the director and Keaton is on top once again,"Alejandro Inarritu directed and won 3 Oscars all together along with his cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki who won an Oscar for his amazing artistic achievement in making the movie look like it was being filmed in all one shot.
Inarritu is a groundbreaking director who also co-wrote the screenplay and led an all star cast starring Michael Keaton, Edward Norton and Emma Stone who were all nominated for Oscars as well.
Keaton is magnificent as an aging comic book movie star and he brings his full background to this role. He could have easily won an Oscar but this movie either way was his comeback film. Everyone shines in this one. Innarritu made a masterpiece with this one but I am sure there are many more to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

Michael Keaton gave a brilliant performance, as did Emma Stone and the rest of the cast.The one ""long take"" aspect is well done, although kind of obvious in places.

A Comedic and Moving Satire on Acting,"If there is at least one film that I implore you to see and embrace, it is Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's latest barnburner of a movie, Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance). The opening shot is like the opening line out of Pynchon's ""Gravity's Rainbow"" as ""a screaming comes across the sky"" from above leading to Michael Keaton meditating in midair as he prepares for his first performance on Broadway with his adaptation of Raymond Carver's ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love,"" in which he stars in and directs. The next two hours is a gripping, funny, and naked look into the world of acting, celebrity, and redemption as Riggan Thomson (Keaton), a former big budget action star from the late-Eighties, tries to get through a hectic three days of preview showings and opening night of his first and maybe last chance of acting. Within the pressure of trying to reclaim his place in the spotlight, Riggan is blindsided by his masochistic, method-acting obsessed co-star (played by Edward Norton) trying to steal his mojo while his daughter/publicist (Emma Stone) and co-star/girlfriend (Andrea Riseborough) try to tame Riggan's ego as he goes through a path of self-reflection and destruction due in part to the voices in his head telling him that ""he should have done that reality show"" and that ""nobody wants to see that talky bullshit"" he has sacrificed to put on stage. Birdman is a profound meditation on the age-old fight between art versus commerce while focusing on the desire for affection.Michael Keaton gives a phenomenally funny and poignant performance as Riggan; many critics have questioned whether life imitates art in regards to Keaton's past success as Batman or Beetlejuice before petering out of top-billing status. Regardless of how close Keaton is compared to Riggan, his intensity, humor, and warmth fit perfectly in what is one of his finest performances in quite a while; his verbal sparring session with a New York Times critic shows he hasn't shown signs of slowing down, just shifting into second gear. Emma Stone gives a raw and powerful performance as he chews out his father hours before going out onstage or contemplating life on the theatre rooftop opposite Edward Norton. With a succession of previous successes on screen, Stone gives her best performance in Birdman.It would be a travesty to label the rest of the cast as ""supporting actors"" as each of them give their pound of flesh on screen. Edward Norton is incredible as he satirizes the method-acting approach whether it is appearing drunk onstage to feel like Raymond Carver when he poured sweat and liquor over the typewriter or getting aroused when the stage curtains open up for him. Seeing him and Keaton clash heads and egos is like watching Jeff Beck and Eric Clapton duel on guitars. Zach Galifianakis delivers a perfect balance of humor and neurosis as Riggan's shrewd lawyer and only friend. Amy Ryan, as Riggan's ex-wife, gives a solid and stoic performance as she sees Riggan wrestle with his emotions in his dressing room. Naomi Watts, who plays a naive actress getting her first break on Broadway, savors every minute of her brief time on screen by giving a sympathetic and funny performance.Alejandro Inarritu continues to raise the bar in his canon of films that focus on the human condition with a supernatural twist as he did with Biutiful and 21 Grams. Birdman is the ultimate film nerd's film as Inarritu manages to create a mesmerizing homage to the auteurs of the past; take the excess and surreal nature of Fellini's 8 1/2, the improvisation and layered characters from Altman's films mixed with the philosophical and supernatural style of Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire, put it in a blender and drink it all up. If there was an Olympic competition for cinematography, Emmanuel Lubezki would reign supreme as his work on the stedicam is fluid and balletic just like his previous work with Alfonso Cuaron. With an incredible cast and a visionary filmmaker at the helm, Birdman stands out as a raw, original, and powerful work of art.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Technically brilliant movie,"This movie has been in the news for quite sometime, and here in India, movies like these are getting released after 2-3 months of its US release. Never-mind, I marked my calendar and booked tickets to this movie, as soon as it opened. I was having quite high expectations on this movie, and I was a whole lot disappointed when I finished watching it.Pros Top notch performance, from the core actors. Be it, Keaton, or Norton, or Stone. Everyone delivered their best. Here, there are lot of actors who would be blindly stated as Hollywood equivalent actors. To all those people who compare home grown actors to Hollywood actors, I would just say ""Learn what is acting, from Michael Keaton in BIRDMAN.""Movie making it self is a great plus here. I found it hard, to see where the scenes were cut, and where the editing was happening. The no. of scenes in this movie would be easily more, than your average movie. Things were happening so damn fast. Simply put, this would stand as the example of modern day film making. Crisp scenes, fast screenplay, razor sharp editing.This is all you got in the movie. There is nothing else to talk about. When I came out of the movie hall, I was totally disappointed. I was feeling left out and craving for more. The emotions are not so deep. The characters are confusing. There is no life in this movie. And, when I knew that Interstellar, and Nightcrawler were overlooked in the award ceremonies for this movie, I felt really bad. Disappointed. Heart broken.This is a very very average movie, with modern filming techniques. But, this alone doesn't make it a masterpiece guys. The movie lacks a gripping screenplay.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Too Brilliant for a Label,"This is the first time I'm using these words, Birdman is a ""modern classic"". I've seen a lot of films from IMDb's top 250 recently and Birdman has just become my favorite of all time alongside The Dark Knight and The Shawshank Redemption. Although Birdman has no similarity with either one of them. In fact you can't connect Birdman with any other film despite all the cultural references. Birdman is one of a kind.Marvelous film making. Powerful screenplay. Legendary acting performance. Alejandro González Iñárritu, before Birdman I've never heard of this man. So it's not like I have some kind of weakness for his style or anything. Yet I've found his directing phenomenal in Birdman. Michael Keaton, experienced actor provided with a role he can connect to easily and the result was acting of a lifetime. Surely Birdman will win Oscar in these three major categories. I feel sorry for Edward Norton and Emma Stone, they gave their best in this film but their roles weren't significant enough to get them on a solid platform to fight for their Oscars. The story is another masterpiece. It's a battle between family and ego. Oh! You think that's Cliché! Don't worry it also have explosions, superheroes and other box office shits. The kind of craps kids these days want. The stuffs that goes viral.The musical score and the production design are kind of annoying but I think they are meant to be annoying. The film editing is another beauty. I don't understand why it didn't get another Academy Award nomination for film editing.Final Verdict: Birdman will show you the plain truth you've always failed to see. This film doesn't need any appreciation from the critics or the audiences. Birdman is it's own critic and audience. It's one of a kind.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"""...it is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.""","If there is one word to sum up this movie it is ""pretentious"". It is a comedy that isn't funny, a drama that isn't serious and a satire that mostly hits back on itself. It is impressive more than enriching and, expect for the contemporary comment on Hollywood and showbiz, there isn't much of an underlying message to take note of here.The redeeming strengths of the film lies in the acting and cinematography that are absolutely top notch. Keaton is giving the performance of a lifetime (and was perfect for the role for obvious reasons), Norton is back in American History X mode, Emma Stone nails the part as Sam and shows that she is someone to be taken seriously in the future. Even Zach Galifianakis is showing new sides of himself and gives a very well rounded performance overall.Alejandro Iñárritu is both writer, director and cinematographer of this movie, it is is by all accounts his baby. And when it comes to directing and cinematography it is a real tour de force, perhaps a bit showy and distracting in places but nonetheless extremely well done and very impressive. If you're a study of cinematography this is a film you should see.The problem lies in the writing, or rather the story and fundamental driving force of the movie. The acting hits a lot of high notes but in the end there is little to take away; the story could have gone a million different ways but it all ends up being is one big poke at Hollywood, showbiz and people who happen to like marvel blockbusters.At it's heart it is a tabloid type movie and has no deeper fundamental meaning than the industry it is trying to poke holes in. It is a film which I'm glad to have watched once, the cinematography and acting alone is beautiful, but it is not a film I will soon give a second viewing.At the end of the day this very film is like a movie critic; it criticizes and judges the works of others but has no lasting message of its own.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Birdman: or (The Unexpected Brilliance of Filmmaking),"This was one of the most masterfully crafted films I have seen in years. An intense drama masked by comedy; phenomenal acting from the entire cast, not a moment is unbelievable. Michael Keaton was top notch (his best performance ever in my opinion). Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography is something to marvel in its self! The idea of following him day to day as one continuous take shows the sad nature to this characters world. Behind the comedy of this films world there is a very depressing nature to the film throughout. Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) is haunted by his past superhero character, Birdman, and it's destroying him as a person.

A unique film told with a lot of class,"Every now and then you come across a film that is unlike anything you've seen before. Sometimes it's hard to put your finger on what exactly makes it so unique but you are in no doubt that is. 'Birdman' is definitely one of those films. Director Alejandro González Iñárritu used a very distinct style while filming this (which sounds like it was a nightmare for the actors), but it has produced great results. It comes across as quirky and fun and gives a sense that the unexpected is right around the corner. I was surprised to see that he is a relatively inexperienced director, as this could easily have been mistaken for the work of a genius of the industry who had been applying his trade for many a decade.The acting is also nothing short of superb. Michael Keaton is obviously the stand out in the lead role. He's in a two horse race with Eddie Redmayne to win Best Actor at the Academy Awards this year and I wouldn't be shocked if he pulled it off. He is captivating in the role and never has even so much as a single weak scene throughout the film. The style the movie was filmed in will give his chances of winning a real boost as well, as you can tell it would have been anything but easy work to make.The other two actors who have been nominated for their supporting roles are Edward Norton and Emma Stone. Norton (who I often refer to as my favourite actor) is nothing short of his brilliant best. You know a performance is great when you are genuinely missing that character being on screen and that's how it was in this. He goes almost entirely missing near the end of the film and it is a real shame because I never felt like I got any closure on his character. Stone is also good, although I think gets overshadowed by the two main actors. I have found the Best Supporting Actress category to be a little weak this year and I think this has helped a few performances get recognition that may not have in other years. There's no doubting though that she held her own in every scene she was in and gave a very solid performance.'Birdman' certainly won't be for everyone. The person I was watching it with couldn't stand it and left about half an hour in for instance. It's billed as a comedy but it's far from conventional in that sense and could disappoint a few people in that way. It's absolutely filled with inside jokes (some right in your face, others not so much) that are imperative to keep in mind throughout if you are to fully appreciate it. The script has certainly been well thought out and the dialogue is excellently written.It's the only film in the Best Picture category giving 'Boyhood' a run for its money, and while it is a slight outsider (it has roughly the same chance of winning as Keaton does of upsetting Redmayne) I would not be the least bit surprised to hear its name read out as the winner come February 22. I've always said the Academy loves a film and about a film (or in this instance a play - as close as they're going to get this year). It will be very interesting to see it all pan out.

Bird scores!!!,"It's a bird, It's a plane, actually it is a bird! It's Birdman!!! And definitely one of the best movies of 2014. Alejandro Gonzalez Iñarritu's directed ""Birdman"" stars Michael Keaton as Riggan, an aging actor who had his thespian heyday in the early 90's playing an iconic superhero named Birdman. And do I have to hit you with a bat on your head, to discover the irony in this since in the early 90's Keaton himself played.... well, you know the rest, or at least I hope you do. Well, anyways back to the current Riggan era. Riggan is now in production of a Broadway play based on a Raymond Carver novel. He stars, wrote the adaptation, and is directing the play. It is here where ""Birdman"" flies with greatness as Iñarritu brilliantly sends us to the backstage Broadway theatre world, and shows us all its complex eccentricities and politics. Alejandro the Great also scribed up a very witty ""Birdman"" screenplay with co-writers Nicolas Giacabone, Alexander Dineralis, and Armando Bo. Michael Keaton was more than phenomenal as Riggan, and Keaton is deserving of all the award love he is receiving. The supporting work of ""Birdman"" also did not fly the coup. Edward Norton was spectacular as Mike, a feisty Broadway actor. Emma Stone was standout as Riggan's daughter Sam. Zach Galifianakis was superb as Riggan's lawyer Jake. Watts out, here comes another brilliant acting effort from Naomi Watts', here playing the emotional-wreck theatre actress Lesley. And other solid supporting work were delivered by Amy Ryan, Andrea Riseborough, and Lindsey Duncan. But this was really Michael Keaton's main stage, and he kept us birdwatching throughout his stupendous performance. My only minor flaw of ""Birdman"" is the one-too-many fantasy-like scenes, but that was just a minor mishap in the ""Birdman"" nest. So rise up and catch the ""Birdman"". ***** Excellent",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

the unexpected brilliance of cinema,"Birdman , though the name is deceiving is not a triple a superhero movie you would expect crowding the Hollywood cinema in this age and era of movie , but this a movie that i can best describe as an experience. Birdman gets nearly every aspect of a good cinema right and in this review i will breakdown each aspect and giving you all the reasons why you need to watch this movie and also validate the fact as to why i rated this 8 and not a shot 10.1) Casting and Performances :- One of the best things in the movie is the wonderfully cast roles.The movie hold an exclusive banner with a stigma array of actors ranging from industry veterans like Michael Keaton and Edward Nortan as well as others like Zach ,Emma stone , Naomi watts ,Andrea Riseborough and so on giving a stellar performance with a well clicked sense of humor and comedic timing. Michael Keaton fits the role perfectly with his brief history of being batman in it's previous iterations. Michael Keaton in this movie is named Riggan once popular for his action superhero movie birdman is now off the fame ladder and tries to make himself significant in the industry with a book adapted play shown in Broadway. Both Michael and Edward Norton taking leads of sort display a spectrum of emotions each of them having a unique charismatic peak. On a whole birdman ""shouts casting done perfectly "" in every frame.2) Direction :- For people who watched Alejandro's previous movie biutiful starring Javier they are certain about one thing, a visual treat which is pleasureful to our eyes. Alejandro's camera is the first person perspective of a real event grounded in reality with each stance of the movie depicting fear , emotions ,characters even without the need of a solid dialogue delivery. Birdman is shot with some really clever camera and editing tricks to make the movie feel like it's shot in a single go. Lighting is perfectly lit , sounds are realistic , angle of shot is dispensed with utmost beauty. It's a rare trait that not many directors inhibit.3) Story :- The story as seen from it's surface is simple and mild going through the struggles ,fears , pain , ego and many other emotions of a man trying to redeem himself and become significant in the world, but what really surprises is the ending that according to me is one of the most well thought out endings for a movie. The movie can be broadly divided into 4 acts , the introduction , the practice , the execution and the finale. The introduction begins with the director showing the type of life Riggan played by Michael Keaton lives , the present , his career and his troubled relationships with his daughter and wife. The director does a clean job in marking out the subtleties in their loose characterized bond with Riggan focusing on his Broadway play , his daughter trying to cope with loneliness and her need for drug use. The second act holds place exclusively for Edward Norton .A stellar performance by him ( for the second time in the year after grand Budapest hotel ). Norton lifts the already lifted show playing a character named Mike , an actor who believes he is a person with only a character he plays but no natural character of his own, more like water in a container taking shape of what he is placed in. The third act is where the movie falls short just a bit with the same story , and narrative dragging on with a bit pacing issue. What really stands out in the movie is the final act , the act that depicts ideologies of realization , self consciousness , self control , ego burst and perfection and as stated previously , an ending that truly makes a difference. The story does a brilliant job in touching concepts and showing the life behind the curtains. Story of actors struggling to act ,story of actors trying to stay in characterized control despite their real life emotional breakdown ,a actors striving to be significant , fights with reviewers and so on , a complete drama package.The reason why i rated this movie 8 is mainly because the movie drags on a bit in the middle and a lot of characters are left out with little to no conclusion.This is movie that is more of art, it's clearly depicted as Alejandro's playground of thoughts , his ideas , this movie is a painting whose beauty can witnessed more than once.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Iñárritu's Best Work,"What a great remarkable film. I had high expectations for it ever since I first heard it was being made two years ago and they were far surpassed. What a comeback performance by Michael Keaton. He IS the movie and the movie IS him. His performance truly deserves an Oscar. Actually, every performance in this movie shines. Norton was splendid and even Emma Stone surprised me with her acting chops (I'm not that big a fan of hers). The film feels like one long take from start to finish with some hidden cuts here and there. This is one of cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki's best works of art. The film is beautiful to look at. Thank you Alejandro González Iñárritu for your dedication in making this piece truly stand out. In my opinion, it's Iñárritu's best work. The time and dedication spent crafting this one shows. For sure he will get some recognition on this one. Got to give it to Mexico's big three filmmakers in leading the way for future generations. Iñárritu, Alfonso Cuarón, and Guillermo Del Toro are some of today's best directors.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Birdman - Depressing brilliance 4 stars,"All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely playersWilliam ShakespeareWalking into the cinema... Birdman has the critics raving... That is usually a deterrent for people to go to see a film. Critical acceptance is usually code for 'art film'. Too bad, because this film looks like a masterpiece. The question has to be, can Michael Keaton carry this film?Art House* rating: 4 stars Family rating: This film is for mature audiences only. It has mature themes and language that should be taken into consideration before viewing.Riggan Thomas (Michael Keaton) is a world renowned actor who played the iconic super hero know as ""The Birdman."" It provided him the opportunity to live out his dreams of acting and brought his life an enviable fame. Eventually the fame and fortune disappeared and he is attempts to get his career back on track. Ultimately, he wants the respect of the thespian community and hopes to achieve it by directing and acting in the classic Broadway dramatic play called ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"". The weekend premiere is coming up and the live previews are underway, but the real drama of Birdman is behind the curtain. The lead actor for the play is injured and his replacement is the brilliant method actor, Mike Shiner (Edward Norton). Mike is a blessing and a curse to Riggan and Brandon Vander Hay (Zach Galifianakis), his lawyer, business partner and friend. Shiner is a master craftsman and his presence helps to boost ticket sales, but he brings the self-absorbed baggage of method acting. Adding to the drama of the production, Riggan wrestles with his theatrical alter-ego, the challenge of his washed up daughter, Sam (Emma Stone), the disdain of an influential critic and the minutia of managing this disastrous stage production. As with many great theatrical events, the behind the stage antics of the players and stage crew lead to disaster after disaster. Riggan's life and the production are a mess, but he has to do all that he can to salvage both through this play.Seeing Birdman causes a love/hate cinematic response. Alejandro González Iñárritu (Babel, 21 Grams) does an masterful work of storytelling. His style has the European flare and brilliance that is not to often experienced in American cinema. Shooting the film as one long take was risky, but added to the tension of the production. He was able to draw from the energy of the theatre and the desperation of the actors. The visual experience was accentuated by the tension of the actors having to deliver their lines and hit their marks. This level of intensity that cannot be manufactured in this era of over-production and excessive editing. Keaton and Norton were at their acting best. Even though they do not admit to an autobiographical nature of the story, their ability to draw from their real life career experiences adds a depth to their performances. Galifianakis gave the performance of his career and represented the glue that holds the story together. His performance added the needed humour and balance to the combustible lead characters. Naomi Watts and Emma Stone held their own in the tension filled, claustrophobic atmosphere of the small theatre. The styling and acting brought forth an engrossing balance of the tragedy and the comedy of live theatre.The styling and story were brilliant, but they also were the reason for the disdain for this film. Iñárritu reaches into the darkest recesses of the human experience and exposes all of the good and bad in humanity. Whenever a director exposes the unenviable existence of actors and what they do to achieve greatness in their field, it sucks the joy out of the cinematic experience. It equates to watching sausage being made, the process makes the product less appealing. Looking deep into the lives of the actors shows the audience that all of humankind wrestles with the same issues of envy and the need for love and acceptance. Also, this film shows the emptiness that can occur when one achieves them. Not that reality is bad, but this film crosses into uncomfortable depths. Every turn of the camera gives the feeling of travelling through Riggan's thoughts. Each corner brings to light something that adds a less than desirable experience. Just when you think that the story could not get any worse, it does. The film contains a brilliance and freshness in cinema, but draws out a despair that should remain in the shadows. If you enjoy being faced with the harsh realities of the world, Birdman is the film for you, but it will not appeal to those seeking an enjoyable cinematic escape. The challenge in seeing this film was to consider where identity, hope and love can truly be found. It is the only means of pulling yourself out of the depression that will engulf your life after seeing this film.Leaving the cinema... Birdman is a true art house experience. The artistry cannot be denied, but the message is hopeless. The direction and acting pushed the performers to new heights in their careers, but the story will push the audience into undesired depths.Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. Where do we find our identity? (Genesis 1:27, 2 Corinthians 5:17) 2. How far should we go to achieve our goals? (Proverbs 21:5, Philippians 3:14) 3. Where can you find hope in this despairing world?

Fly into the brilliantly original world of Birdman.,"It's not very often I leave the cinema with a huge smile on my face. On one of my no drinking days - I simply had to go for a beer with my friend to chat through one of most original films I have seen in years. Birdman see's Michael Keaton star as a washed up actor who once played the world famous Birdman - a super hero, that in the 90's was a huge box office hit. Sound familiar?Keaton's character Riggan​ is in the process of writing and starring in a new play to try and establish himself as a credible actor. Riggan though is plagued with personal issues, His wife has left him, his daughter is full of resentment for him after never being there for her and worst of all he is convinced that he actually has super powers.​The film opens with a long tracking shot that sweeps around each character, after 5 minutes you realise that this is going to be the style for the whole film and cuts are disguised by tracking down a dark corridor or bright light. It works beautifully, you feel like you are right in amongst the action and connect with each character as the camera roams around the three or four locations the film is set in. ​ Overall the film is definitely one of the most intriguing, original and wonderfully acted films I have seen for a long while. Keaton is at his best as this self obsessed, depressed yet still likable character and is complimented by a fine comedic performance from Ed Norton.The film is accompanied by a rather strange yet perfect soundtrack which is mainly percussion based. There are even moments when a random drummer is playing part of the soundtrack in the street! Original films are hard to find and this is possibly the most original and intriguing film I have seen since Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless mind. It's funny, a little sad, yet totally compelling and a must watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
A modern classic,"Good film. One of the best, ever. Tickles the mind, challenges the senses, and probes the spirit. Im not sure the 20s viewers will connect with it fully. But I hope they will.Its like a modern hash of Lost in Translation - but on speed. The characters and scenes are presented like touch points to the Keaton's character, who is propelled like a bird through storm to storm, to Tornado to Cyclone to something even bigger.Its also a bit like watching a Quentin Tarantino production. The support characters are very strong, and creates a series of tense moments and scenes. You start to wonder... What's going to happen in this scene? Whats going to happen in the next few seconds?The subtext about advantage of ignorance is also good, and works at several layers. As are the outrageous scenes, most of which are confined in the tunnels of a Broadway theater.Its fast paced in many parts, with fast dialogue. So it can a bit hard to catch, for those not familiar with English. Which is interesting considering the writer/director's first language is Spanish.Iñárritu is a product of Central American, European and Hollywood experience and influence. And it shows! This is a masterpiece, which I will place next to Godfather, Reservoir Dogs and seven Samurai.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
One person's trash is another person's treasure..,"So after a lot of debate, I decided to watch this movie today. 9 Oscar nominations... Was it just by chance? Was it just because critics loved its uniqueness? Was it due to performances alone?Every now & then some movies come along that just blow you away. This is one of them. I understand everyone is entitled to their opinions. But discouraging somebody to NOT see this movie is a CRIME.Of the many complaints that people have about this movie I would like to address a couple of them that I felt were the most unfair.. Some say that this movie has no storyline.. No plot.. My answer is.. Watch a Hitchcock movie if u r craving for a plot.. This movie has a storyline & its wonderful. The essence of his accomplishment washes over you like a cool breeze in a world of confusion. Others complain about the metaphorical ending. I felt that it is supposed to be like that. That's what unique movie making is all about. The director respects the viewer's intellect to interpret the ending according to how we desire. For that utmost respect goes to the genius.All in all no matter what people say, I would recommend you to give it a try. You will adore it if its your cup of tea. If not then realize that, One person's trash is another person's treasure. This was a treasure to me & maybe it will be for you too..",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

The Phoenix Rises,"When it comes to films, I try and stay hidden from advance reviews in order to always go into the cinema with an open mind and thus, be unaware of what anyone has said about the film before I have seen it. Unfortunately for the case of Birdman, this was unavoidable. After seeing a range of films in the cinema over Christmas, a Birdman trailer was always guaranteed along with the many 5 star reviews that are presented to you during its' run-time. Because of this, I went into the screening of Birdman with my expectation level moderately high yet, once the film had finished, it is fair to say I wasn't disappointed.In terms of plot, Micheal Keaton plays Riggan Thompson, a washed-up Hollywood star famous for playing the role of superhero 'Birdman' who, at an attempt to get his career back on track, takes a shot at Broadway by means of writing, directing, and starring in an adaptation of the short story What We Talk About When We Talk About Love by Raymond Carver, an idol of Thompson's. Unbeknownst to anyone else, Thompson is plagued by the subconscious voice of Birdman, who, along with a faltering family and disruptive cast, place Thompson's life and career firmly in the balance.Firstly, it is fair to say that Birdman is something unlike anything else I think I have ever seen before within cinematic history, with its' mix of genres, (Is it a drama? Black comedy? Satire? Superhero movie?) fantastic cinematography, (by Oscar-winning Emmanuel Lubezki who won the award for Gravity) and a brilliantly barmy plot performed perfectly by an equally superb ensemble cast. Secondly, Keaton is excellent (I am running out of superlatives) as Thompson and should easily be recognised within the upcoming awards season, even if I couldn't help but draw parallels between his character's life and his own (Keaton played Batman in the Tim Burton films). Lastly, the satirical notions regarding cinema in today's society were greatly emphhasised and executed throughout the film, particularly the scene with a fancy dress Iron Man fighting Spider- Man which, in my opinion, was rather splendid. The films' two hour running time, in general, went quickly, although I felt there seemed to be too many scenes where the film was set to end and then quickly carried on, yet this didn't deter the utter joy I felt whilst watching it.Overall, Birdman is a brilliant, barmy, and bonkers piece of cinema which no doubt will end up somewhere in my Top Ten films of 2015. Keaton is superb. The visuals are stunning. The plot is splendid. RIP Batman, long live Birdman.Overall Score: 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"Full of itself, but deservingly so?","Hollywood is full of itself, and no movie is as self-serving as Birdman or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance. This film is one big ego trip, and its mere premise fails to make the audience feel sorry for main character Riggan, played by Michael Keaton. The disappointing ending adds to the viewer's anger with the selfish Riggan, whose biggest gripe in life is that his stardom has faded. With that said, the movie has entertainment value. Tremendous acting jobs by Keaton, Edward Norton as the self-absorbed Broadway star, and Emma Stone as the recovering addict daughter (all deservingly nominated for Academy Awards) and the illusion of the movie being filmed in one continuous take make Birdman worth viewing, and makes director Alejandro Inarritu deserving of his Best Director nomination.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Shockingly Amazing,"To be blatantly honest, I din't expect much from this film. I heard it was critically acclaimed, but ""12 Years a Slave"" was also loved by critics and that movie didn't deserve its praise. I was shocked to discover one of the most brilliant movies to be made in the past decade. This movie truly transcends from entertainment to art, and I think that's what the director was going for. First of all, the cinematography was fantastical, allowing the entire film to look like it was made in one shot. It is awe inspiring, but cinematography cannot carry a film. That's where the acting came in. Every character was perfect, played brilliantly by the cast. Characters were not only believable, but also interesting, which is hard to pull off well. The story does fall a little flat, but not so in a bad way. The somewhat simple story allows the actors to play off each other perfectly, and also allows the film to make many statements about things such as film making and critics. The film truly surpassed all expectations, and even explores the psychological side of Micheal Keaton's character, which leads to many shenanigans. These shenanigans show the film to actually be quite funny, and even more entertaining. Birdman was a surprise hit, and it deserves every award it will surely be nominated for. If you missed Birdman, it is a much watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"Excellent, but falls short of being a masterpiece","Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's ""Birdman"" is a masterpiece on many levels. First of all, a very unusual camera technique is used to make the entire film feel like one continuous shot, which is very engrossing. Secondly, the soundtrack consists almost entirely of scattered, dissonant jazz percussion, which gives the film an unhinged feel. It really is on a level with the one in Kubrick's ""The Shining"". Thirdly, all of the lead actors give solid, occasionally great, performances.But what makes this film fall short of being a masterpiece, oddly enough, is Inarritu's directing and writing. The frequent use of surrealism is intriguing, but it doesn't seem to have much meaning or purpose. The story is thin and exists only in service of the performances. Nevertheless, ""Birdman"" is an experience you will remember for some time, and I urge you to see it.8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

I can't the terrible overacting hold against the actors, they got the job, they do what they're told or what they think they'd have to do. The misery comes from the director and screen writer. After about 10 minutes my mind started to wander off, staring at the endlessly senseless Stedicam camera moves - ahh, oh so fluid and oh so meaningless. The constant effort to produce 'energy' robs all of it out the picture. Resume: pseudo intellectuals will be flocking to this film for reasons unknown.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Impressive in every way!,"-So Birdman is about an actor named Riggan, played by Michael Keaton, who used to play a Holylwood superhero named Birdman until he quit in 1992. He is now trying to put on an artistic stage-play on Broadway to make himself known as a high class actor really. Only problem is everything. He has Mike, his supporting actor played by Edward Norton, who causes all kind of problems on set. He has his daughter who is just out of rehab. He has a critic who wants to close his play. Oh, and he literally has the character of Birdman following him around like an evil shoulder-angel.-Birdman is a perfect example of how to make an artistic AND great film! It is pretty impressive in every category I can think of! (Really.) -The story: There are some obvious parallels to Batman in this. In 1992, Michael Keaton says no to Batman 3 after Batman Returns came out. The film is very accepting of this to the point where it is almost mocking Hollywood films, but then defending them! I think the story is great because it is so ground in reality! -The pace of the film is pretty good. One of the BEST things about it is that the entire film looks like one shot. I kid you not. There are a few day-to-night transitions, but other than that there are just no cuts in it.-The acting is some of the best of the year. Michael Keaton killed it, probably because he could pull from personal experience so much. Edward Norton was probably my favorite actor in it and he killed it! Emma Stone had probably the best performance of her career! And Zach Galifianakis was so good he was actually my favorite character! Never thought I would say that.-The characters themselves feel real because of how broken they seem. Michael Keaton especially is pretty crazy, whereas it's hard to really love any of the characters.-The editing is Oscar worthy.-The music is all drums and symbols, with some classical pieces. Very odd, but very original.-The themes of the film are probably one of the best things about it. It really dissects what a Hollywood film is by comparing blockbuster pics to indie films and Hollywood to the stage. I could go on and on about it, but it really just lays out what's what.-Content: It is rated-R. It has some language throughout. Not as much as Fury, but it is consistent. The rest of the content would probably be PG-13. It has a butt and some suggestive content, with some references, implied awkward moments, and an inappropriate kiss. Still probably PG-13 worthy. It also has some brief violence. Also PG-13 worthy. (So R for language) -All-in-all, Birdman was probably, in my seasoned opinion, the best film of the year. It has a great story, great themes, great acting, fantastic editing, and yeah. Birdman is totally worth seeing in theaters! Now I will say it is not like Guardians Of The Galaxy fun, but I will easily give Birdman an 8/10!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
A film which questions all about modern society,"Birdman director Inarittu excels himself here. Not just is Birdman technically brilliant with its almost fluent long takes,but ground- breaking through its moral questioning.Firstly, Birdman is entertaining to its core. As well as a strong script, performances particularly from Keaton, Norton and Stone are extremely strong and laugh-out-loud hilarious. The film-making itself is also a technical achievement. Inarittu's ability bulk out character development whilst also creating a fluent, enthralling story about Keaton's last shot at an acting career after years playing his alter ego, Birdman, is second to none.However where this film particularly excels in its metaphorical meaning. So many brutally honest questions are asked by this film about not just movie industry itself, but about us as a human race. Is creativity dead within motion picture? Are those who act on screen hierarchical to all else? Do you have to have supernatural power to be superhuman?All these questions are asked of the viewer and many more. It's snub at the Globes is a travesty, and I implore all who love film not just to be passive but insightful to catch Birdman before it leaves theaters.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"The Theatah, the Theatah, What Happened to the Theatah?","While watching ""Birdman,"" the latest from Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (""Babel,"" ""Amores Perros,"" ""21 Grams"") I felt an admiration and respect for it that never bubbled over into emotional involvement. The acting is superb, and Inarritu chooses to film his story in what appears to be one fluid shot; there are no cuts in the film, and instead master cinematographer Emanuel Lubezki (currently the best one in the business as far as I'm concerned) sends his camera swooping around the rooms and hallways of New York's St. James Theatre, where most of the action of the film is set. So I noticed and admired the formal aspects of the film, but didn't connect with it on any meaningful level.But as time has passed since I saw it, the film has lingered in my head and gathered a richness I didn't feel like it had when I first left the theatre. I'm still not sure it will be one of my favorite movies of the year, but I can say I really really liked it, and I certainly liked it much more than any of Inarritu's previous movies.In ""Birdman,"" Michael Keaton gives a just-shy-of-excellent performance as a washed up actor best known for a superhero series who's trying to prove something to himself and everyone else by mounting a Broadway play. The fiction of the play blends in with the facts of life, and the seamlessness of the actual filmmaking adds to the ambiguity of the story. I've always liked Keaton, and I'm not surprised to find that he has dramatic abilities as an actor that haven't been tapped before (or at least not frequently; he did expand his range in ""Clean and Sober""). But he's still somewhat limited as an actor, and I can't help but feel that a better actor, someone like Christian Bale, say, who could lose himself so completely into a character, would have made ""Birdman"" overall a richer experience. After all, we're with Keaton's character almost non-stop for the entire film, so he has to be played not only by an actor who you want to be with for that much time (which Keaton is) but also who can keep you interested for the entire time (which Keaton does only partly successfully). The problem is, and this is a huge compliment to the casting director, the actors around Keaton are so good that they overwhelm him, and I found myself wanting to follow them rather than stay with Keaton. Particularly good are Edward Norton as a cocky actor, and Emma Stone as Keaton's surly daughter. Naomi Watts is always good, even if she's underused here as another member of the acting company, while Amy Ryan is excellent as usual in a couple of scenes as Keaton's ex-wife.""Birdman"" explores some interesting themes, chiefly the need in humans to feel relevant and how social media has changed the way people go about doing that; and more specifically to the entertainment industry the dynamic between Hollywood and the legitimate stage. But neither theme is as developed as I would have liked.Still, if I don't end the year thinking that ""Birdman"" is one of my favorites, I will at least probably think it's one of the most original.Grade: A-",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
You will not forget this film,"A priceless film by director Alejandro González Iñárritu, a genius totally at odds with Hollywood values, and one not fearing to ask of his actors total truth and exposure and even madness to get at the bare and painful truth of the story. Michael Keaton plays Riggin, an aging actor famous for his Birdman character in a Batman-like, comic book movie from twenty years earlier. Washed up and broke, he now risks whatever is left producing and acting in an old play about love by a famous playwright he once met in a bar. The play is now rehearsing on Broadway, and Riggin is torn and thrashed at every turn by the play's production problems, his star actor's arrogance, his own past, his angry daughter, a vicious media critic, and most especially the insane voice in his head and his life-threatening fear of failure.Director Inarritu, he of 21 Grams and Biutiful fame, fashions a film story unlike any director working today, more like a play than a film, with no ""movie star turns"" by any actor, with no one character overpowering the others, all working for and off each other for the best end result....the most truth in themselves and in the story. Keaton was an inspired selection for the lead considering that he once played Batman 20 years ago, and that he obviously had personal experience with a lot of the same emotions that Riggin felt....trying to come back, trying to overcome old and worn out fame, trying to prove that he was more than a has-been movie star. Riggin was also giving his life trying to prove to himself and the world that he could make it as a real producer/actor in the toughest venue possible....Broadway. He must prove it to himself... even after he harmed his chances by scolding a hateful critic that was determined to make his play a flop. Plus, as if more pain were needed, Riggin was a ""recovering"" alcoholic and an guilt-ridden absentee father to his resentful daughter who was helping out as a gofer. All of that impossible to overcome? Yes, perhaps, except for grace that the Unintended Virtue of Ignorance might provide.Edward Norton and Naomi Watts were strong support, along with a great turn by Zach Galifianakis as Riggin's agent/manager/best friend, and Emma Stone as his daughter. Inarriti always gets such honest but tortured performances from his actors, and the result of that effort is a film that surely will be a future classic and is without a doubt the best film of the year to date. Keaton is a lock for a Best Actor nomination as is Inarritu for Best Director. The searing and painful truth of this story and its superb acting is what great and classic films are made of.

The best and most unique motion picture of the year.,"""Birdman"" is a comedy drama directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and stars Michael Keaton, Emma Stone, Zach Galifianakis and Edward Norton. Riggan Thomson, played by Keaton, is an actor on the last leg of his career. It has been 20 years since the original Birdman movie came out and made him a star. He has searched for relevance within his art ever since. His last chance at being remembered as anything other than Birdman comes in a theater adaptation of Raymond Carver's ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love,"" which he wrote, and is directing and staring in. The play starts to fall apart and Thomson's psyche goes with it. He starts to imagine the character of Birdman as an alternate personality of his and the lines between reality and fantasy become more blurred. Michael Keaton is a man mostly known for one role. While many cinephiles will tell you the man has had a plethora of amazing characters to his name, there is one that still haunts him to this day, Batman (1989). Since then, he has become an actor fighting under the shadow of success, which makes him perfect for the role of Riggan Thomson. Keaton is beyond excellent in this film. It will be a crime if he does not win an Oscar for Best Actor this year. He brings sadness to his character and plight. The fight for relevance is something every creative person can relate to and he makes it even more heartbreaking. It is never truly stated whether Thomson sees truth or illusion. The character is constantly on the edge of a breakdown, he adds realism and believability to the fantasies around him. The acting in general is to be commended. Stone and Norton both give award-worthy performances as well. Stone plays Thomson's drug addicted daughter and Norton plays a fictional version of himself. Both play characters who, in the wrong hands would be deplorable, but they make them charming. There are many interesting and engaging aspects of this film. The continuous shots, the mixture between meta-realism and off-the-wall visuals and random moments of black comedy make it compelling. The meta-realism of this movie is present and sound. Many pieces of fiction fail at building a convincing world, but this movie never struggles with it. The superhero craze, the nature of critics and the personality of an actor are just some of the aspects of this movie which make it successful.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"An ambitious film about Broadway, life and relationships","Birdman was one of the most ambitious films of the year and Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu managed to pull off this very unique film about a former movie star trying to get back in the spotlight through a Broadway film. At first that is what it seems it is going to focus on but it does touch on more deeper meanings involving his family and his relationships with himself and those around him. Michael Keaton was definitely the best part of the film, he portrayed Riggan so well that i began to believe that this could have actually been a real person. He showed so much passion in playing this character that you really get sucked in to his amazing performance. The supporting cast i felt also did a pretty good job but did not shine as brightly as Keaton.Another highlight from the film has to be the ingenious and mesmerising method used to film it. The one-shot sweeping camera technique used gave this film a very different feel than many other films and really let you follow these characters and get to see them in all different environments without all of the jarring cuts. The performances as well as shooting technique are what make this film what it is. But that was still not enough for me to absolutely love this movie, the overall tone of the film didn't really work for me, i understood why they went for a dark and comedic yet also dramatic tone as there were some sections that i really enjoyed but for the most part i couldn't really enjoy the entire film as much as i wanted to. Despite not being able to really enjoy this film as much as i had hoped, i still got to see one of the performances of the year in one of the more different films of 2014, if you are an admirer of some different, quality film this may be the film for you - 7.6",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Keaton/Norton on top form,"Birdman delivers some truly great performances notably from Keaton and the very skilled Norton. The depth of both their characters and they way they interact on and off stage defines the quality of Birdman as a film.,....as a story.The authenticity of Keaton's portrayal as a previously successful actor trying to rekindle the glory is tangible. His emotion real, his pain confusion and soul searching thought provoking and credible. The Oscar nomination was well deserved and if he had won, it would have been no surprise (it went to Eddie Redmayne for Theory of Everything)Norton also deserved the Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. His performance was rock solid as the super confident stage actor brought in by Keaton's character at the last minute. In fact, his role is at times in danger of stealing the film...a top performance and also worthy of the Oscar nomination.Finally, Emma Stone who plays Keaton's grumpy daughter must also get a mention. Superbly complex as the daughter who did not see enough of her dad when she was young. Unlike similar characters in other films, she balances the hard edge with vulnerability and confidence and similar to Keaton and Norton, provides an exceptional performance.....also also deserved the Oscar nomination.The film resonates with life in so many ways. The challenges we all face dealing with different people trying to work towards the same goals....somehow, struggling as perspective and agenda gets in the way. This plays out beautifully in Birdman and leaves you with a whole range of emotions from happiness to sadness, to strength and reflection.I loved it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"Challenging, Intriguing and Inventive, But Also Presumptive and Overbearing","Michael Keaton leads the charge as a teetering schizophrenic actor, struggling to find validation on Broadway after a long, expired run as a glossy Hollywood blockbuster-dweller. On a purely technical level, it's astounding. Precisely edited to appear as though the whole thing were executed in one extremely long take, it's a mesmerizing experience, profoundly different and expertly crafty when the timeline needs to leap forward. It's dazzlingly acted, too, with Keaton delivering a masterful performance alongside noteworthy supporting work from Ed Norton, Emma Stone and (to my surprise) a very versatile Zach Galifianakis. The moral lessons are laid on thick, though, and too often it feels like we're being lectured for daring to indulge in the kind of loathsome fun that drove our lead to this strange brand of mania. One scene in particular, Keaton's confrontation with a stuffy critic before opening night (who glares right into the camera before storming off in a cloud of self-righteousness) plays like a direct scolding of the audience. Maybe theatre purists will take this as a firm voice of reason, the rare call of someone who finally *gets* it, but to me it came off as tremendously stuck-up and pretentious. I can't deny there's a lot to enjoy here, and it's a clear arrival for auteur Alejandro González Iñárritu, but I also can't help wondering how much better it would be without that permeating air of superiority.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
An Ambitious Drama Told in an Unusual Style,"It is not a usual drama full of dialogue or a superhero film, but the way that the screenwriters manipulate to present the whole story is surprisingly stunning. It ventures into the stage performance, film industry, the fight between the integrity and mind of the artists, the critics, the over bloating superheroes film in Hollywood; all are perfectly crafted into the life of an old actor who is struggling with his egoism in attempting to recover both his career and family. This journey of crisis, transformation, battling of stressful emotions and the inner powerful demon of himself are well played by Michael Keaton, thanks to the strong and loud jazz drum scores as well as magical, thrilling, ambitious style of delivering by Mexican director Alejandro González Iñárritu.

Birdman acting,"I was expecting ""Birdman or (The unexpected virtue of ignorance)"" to be a blow up acting lesson, but it really surprised me with its completeness and universal message...Alejandro González Iñárritu really did it well. He is a proved and delightful author and director already, but this movie can really bring an Oscar to Michael Keaton.But let's start with the atmosphere. The set is New York - WOW! I am really impressed how they showed us The Big Apple's artistic district. The camera work is incredible - long shots, beautifully transferring from one scene to another. The moving of the camera is flawless and alive. The viewer really feels the vibrant life of the main characters. And the music is very clever and fitting. Especially the rhythm and the pacing of the action are exact and provoke our emotional reaction almost every time. The whole setting and scenery is creative and true to the Broadway style life.I must say that the main character Riggan (Michael Keaton) and Mike (Edward Norton) play almost perfect embodiments of how the modern actor's behavior. This encyclopedia of decision making and emotionally hazard behavior is tempting the viewer to feel empathy for them. I completely enjoyed their acting and felt that after all the American acting school is not behind the European at all. Hollywood may produce tons of bullsh*t, but Fox Searchlight has proved again its record of good production choices. And the acts in this film are really classical in a way. The falling out of glory struggling Riggan is investing his career and sanity into the play What ""We Talk About When We Talk About Love"". And we can feel the thickness of tension which is building up on his head. The reference to Keaton's actual career is evident, so we feel true empathy to the main character in Birdman. His alter ego - the Birdman is constantly reminding us of the Ego of every actor who has received appreciation, but is craving for more. And Norton's character Mike is truly an expected surprise representing the actors' boldness and ingenuity. The supporting cast - Zach Galifianakis (just wow!), Naomi Watts (the usual delved into character personality), Emma Stone and Andrea Riseborough add to the constellation of stars shining on the stage and on the screen. I must say - with such a cast a good director such as Iñárritu has done marvels of wonder!Maybe I am too exuberant in my rants about this film, but I feel that we're witnessing really a piece which is close to perfection. I really enjoyed it very much and the true reason for that is the script. The story's both particular and general view for modern acting and the current condition of the cinematic industry have really impressed me. Every line is on spot, the ideas are not new, but are presented very fresh. One can only reflect upon the true nature and signification of the theater, cinema and acting as a profession and way of life. Yes, way of life. Because after all, depending on the situation, we all tend to act and react. All humans are actors in a way.

"Entertaining, Accessible, Rigorous","Dazzling and imaginative, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's tour de force soars because this time around, he's less of a moralizer and much more of a philosopher. Inarritu employs every visual trick in his repertoire (the film's signature is that it seems unedited) but enjoyably employs them in the service of a fable set in a Broadway theater. The result feels refreshingly immediate, urgent; in such a setting, the questions asked feel worthwhile. What's really interesting is that the questions themselves deal with a topic specific to a target (read: educated) audience. Inarritu and his collaborators (writers Nicolas Glacobone, Alexander Dinelaris and Armando Bo) concern themselves with art and all sorts of questions related to it: why is it made, who is it being made for, how does it relate to the the individual as well as the collective? Michael Keaton, wonderful in a performance imbued with a gravitas he seldom draws upon, plays an action-movie actor attempting redemption by directing, starring and adapting Raymond Carver for the stage; in order to realize his vision, he must run a harrowing gauntlet consisting of an antagonistic, preening actor (Edward Norton, loads of fun), a relationship with a co-star (Andrea Riseborough), a daughter fresh out of rehab (Emma Stone) and a critic hell-bent on destroying him (Lindsay Duncan). Inarritu works with a magical realism (Keaton is able to use telekinesis to manipulate his surroundings and is responsible for some of the stresses that befall him) but the film, taking place as it does in a familiar setting, seems grounded throughout even when the open-ended (yet fulfilling) conclusion is just as magical; rather than the clean resolutions that restored the world in ""Babel"", here it's the individual, alone and detached from every surrounding antagonist, that makes a messy breakthrough and the result speaks to every member of the viewing audience. Entertaining and accessible but also rigorous, it's about time a film played to an engaged audience and not only to the multiplex masses. Kudos to Antonio Sanchez' brilliant drum score, which continuously yet subtly comments on the film's content.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
You can fool some people some times but you cant fool all the people all the time,"This review's title goes to A. G. Iñarritu. How pretentious and messy can you get when you write and direct a script? Birdman-type. A whole new adjective for a movie suspiciously similar to Synecdoche New York, from Charlie Kaufman.This is not a movie theatre experience. This is self-pretentious, lisergic pseudo intellectualism. Not to say, plagiarism.What did we do to deserve this, I don't know. This movie is madness out of boring. Actors did quite well, but the film's clumsy and drags them along, merging with pseudo intellectual scripting, one-shot style in a NY theatre's backstage... this cannot be so over-hyped for Christ's sake.Worst movie Hollywood sold me in quite a long time. Can not understand the positivism about this. This is like 12 years of Slavery, now absolutely forgotten because it was a forgettable movie.St. Vincent, Gone Girl, even Wild Tales (Relatos Salvajes)from Argentina, have lots of more fun than this, without the ""I know what's going on, you idiot, you don't know sh**"" attitude from director. This kind of subliminal and liminal messages Iñarritu sends in the middle of this pretentious form of art as he claims is what pisses me off the most. I can even understand the bad script, the no-story plot. I can understand it. But I don't know how this guy manages to go with other filmmakers and stand in front of those men with his face unaltered. I'd be crying in shame asking for forgiveness. First, for robbing the plot from Charlie Kaufman. And then, for torturing all of us with that drum soundtrack that puts us on our nerves. For a drum solo story, go and see Whiplash. That's a movie where it fits well.I mean, even Babel had its moments. This is nude wrestling, one-shot theater pomposity I don't need in my life, and no one should have to suffer from this.I had to overcome Babel, giving it a chance, and saying I'd mostly liked it. I didn't want to confront the massive positive opinion about that. 21 grams.. passable, but pretentious too. Now Birdman is Iñarritu at his best: one of the most irritating directors of all time.Worst movie I've seen in a few years. Since Tree of Life, I guess.I'm sorry for Michael Keaton, they are using his talented gift to sell this rubbish.What happens next is that Keaton will still be Michael Keaton and we'll love him forever. I can not say the same on the person who shot this lame movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Birdman in my eyes is a perfect film,"Riggan: I'm nothing. I'm not even here.The story to Birdman is about an wash up actor (Michael Keaton) - famous for portraying an iconic superhero - as he struggles to mount a Broadway play. In the days leading up to opening night, he battles his ego and attempts to recover his family, his career, and himself.Okay in my review of Whiplash I bought this movie up mid way through the review just to give a heads up of when I'm going to watch it, because Birdman was my most hyped film of 2014. But just like every time I really wanted to see a film so baldy I have to wait for a while until I finally get a chance to watch it, story of my life really. But anywhere I was really looking forward to this movie ever since September, and now finally seeing the film I can safely say that Birdman is one of the best movie of 2014.I always know that Micheal Keaton was the kind of movie star that will pick any random movie role just because... well he what's to be important and still show to everyone that he still got it, I guess?. Like early last year now he was in two movies that were pretty blah, and that was The Robocop remake and the film Need for Speed, and those films just made Keaton look like he was just cashing it in just for the sake of it. Until when I watched this movie and seeing Micheal Keaton's performance and thinking to myself ""Wait is Keaton giving probably his best performance I've ever seen in my life? I think he is"", because Keaton in this movie pretty much pulls of the best performance I've seen him in his all career. His character in this movie is like a wash up actor who had everything like love from the critics, his fans. Yeah he still dose have that Keaton thing that he always dose in his previous movies, but the scenes where he plays his character (Which is himself if you really look at his character in this movie) but anywhere he still gives a strong and believable performance that at times give me flashbacks of the good old days where he still had roots and felt like he isn't just cashing it in. I hear a lot of Oscar buzz about his performance in this movie, and I wouldn't be surprise if he wins because he totally deserves it. Excellent work Keaton.Edward Norton is this movie pretty much plays a familiar character to himself has the hard to work with actor that at times doesn't follow the lines that he was given or even the direction he was told. We already know that Norton is a fantastic actor in his previous work, but in this movie his performance could be descried has stellar and insanely good.Emma Stone is this movie and of course like most of the actors I named of so far of who outstanding they were in this movie and well you can already guess what I'm going to say next. Emma Stone acting in this movie was just terrific and marvellous to watch in this movie and it's good to see a real break out performance from her more than the lay back ones in her other movies. Nice one Emma. The other cast in the movie like Naomi Watts, Zach Galifianakis both did good as well.The movie is shot to look like it's all one shot take and my mind was just blown away by that fact. There where screens were I said to myself ""Oh my god is it one shot?"", well I can already imagine the stress, hard work and how many takes they had to do to get it, and boy did it pay off nicely, because I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I dared myself to look away from the beautiful cinematography and the impressive editing used in the film.The movie has a brilliant message about film critics today that doesn't feel like it's in your face message that you normally get in movies. There is a scene in this movie and it's not a spoiler by the way, but I really need to get this out the way first. So anywhere Micheal Keaton character just starts having a rant over this theater critic who is going to give a bad review to his play when she hasn't even seen it or seen any of the premieres. He talks about how she only users big words that nobody will say in person and shes to lazy to come up what she really thinks about it so she users big words just to fill in the sentence. This movie probably has the best rant in movie history and Keaton in that scene shows how good of a actor that he is.For problems in the movie... I really don't have any to be honest.I loved this movie and yes I'm coming out be saying that. This isn't just the best movie of the year and such, no this is just flawless film making right here. Birdman and Whiplash are the two films I will highly recommend to people because those two films are my favorite films of 2014.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Keaton's Oscar should be in the bag,"Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's ""Birdman"" is one of the great films about the theatre and about acting. Ironically, if it has a fault it's that the play within the film isn't really that good, (but then they never are; if they were they would exist as plays in their own right). That aside, in every other respect, this is a sublime film that manages to poke fun at the current fad of movie stars attempting to prove they are really actors and not just celebrities by strutting their stuff upon the stage while at the same time honoring the whole concept of what it means to be an actor in the first place as well as giving us a crash course in what it takes to put a straight play on Broadway.The straight play in question is an adaptation of Raymond Carver's collection of short stories ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"" and the man staging it, and starring in it, is Riggan Thompson, a once famous film star who made his name playing the titular superhero Birdman and who pulled the plug on his own career by refusing to do ""Biridman 4"". The play is a psychodrama with a central character searching for love and himself and finding neither and it seems to mirror Riggan's own life. He's got an ex-wife, a druggy daughter and a co-star who happens to be a Broadway 'name' (and the bigger draw) and who seems to be hi-jacking the play. The film's also a comedy and often a very funny one and is certainly the best thing Inarritu has done since ""Amores Perros"".Michael Keaton is Riggan and he is magnificent. Keaton himself has been something of a spent force in the cinema recently so you might say he has put a good deal of himself into the role. Whatever, this is a career-best performance that should see him pick up a well-deserved Oscar next month. Indeed, no-one in this movie puts a foot wrong. As the vain Broadway star Edward Norton hasn't been this good in years. Emma Stone is superb as the daughter and as other Broadway types Zach Galifianikis, Amy Ryan, Andrea Riseborough, Naomi Watts and Lindsay Duncan add to the brilliant ensemble.It's also superbly photographed by Emmanuel Lubezki whose continually swooping, roaming camera gives the impression of it all being done in one long, continuous take. Here is a movie that really soars, both literally and metaphorically; a film about the theatre that is unashamedly cinematic. (There's one astonishing moment when Inarritu, and Keaton, play their biggest scene off-screen). This is the kind of intelligent entertainment that restores one's faith in movies and it really shouldn't be missed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
What is it to exist anyway?,"A short film review of ""Birdman"" because, well, why not?""The thing is a thing not what is said of that thing"" said the mirror -A wholly satisfying film to consume - marinated in well seasoned thoughts of identity and existentialism wrapped in satire, Birdman stylistically asks us ""what is it to exist anyway?"" This feature film, a latest in a queue of interesting titles (Biutiful, Babel and Amores Perros) by Alejandro González Iñárritu literally marches to the beat of it's own drum, punches through the screen, invades your psyche and compels it's audience to engage through a range of perspectives.Essentially a film about a washed-up actor ""Riggan"" brilliantly played by Michael Keaton, (a great casting choice as let's face it what was the last film he did anyway,) this film follows the protagonists journey to finding truth in his craft. On surface level a zero to hero journey, but your budding cine-literate will wiggle with wonder at the fleshy layers of subtext; Reality vs illusion, Addiction and my favorite of all relevance in today's ever evolving yet grossly primal social climate.This funny and significant body of social commentary sees the usually boring (you know it's true) Emma Stone deliver her most engaging performance yet. However, the delectable Edward Norton keeps us entertained throughout with probably his most edible role since Fight Club. As I seem to be drawing on most loved participants in this film a particularly special mention must then go to Lindsay Duncan who could give Addison DeWitt* a run for his money in an award for execution of rhetoric as emitted by a theater critic!Birdman is a refreshing intake compared to a wealth of current films that reek of pastiche. An invigorating film, this work of art happily respects it's viewers as intelligent and knowing. A real treat for the senses this visual feast is not one to be missed. __________________________________________________ *A character from the Award winning All About Eve starring Bette Davis, which if you haven't seen may require you to reassess your priorities in life",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"A Technical Marvel That's Ambitious, Audacious & Astonishing.","From the director of Amores Perros, 21 Grams & Babel, Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is Alejandro Gonzáles Iñárritu's most distinct & daring film to date when compared to his previous works, and certainly the most ambitious one around on a technical scale as the renowned filmmaker here aims to blur the lines between theater & film as well as reality & fiction without breaking continuity and for the most part, he truly succeeds.Birdman tells the story of a former Hollywood star famous for playing an iconic superhero decades ago & who is now a washed up actor. Filled with regret, constantly tormented by the voice of his most memorable character & fearing of falling into oblivion, he decides to make a comeback by risking everything he has on a Broadway play, hoping that its success will revitalize his career. But as the play approaches its premiere, he runs into several issues.Co-written, produced & directed by Alejandro Gonzáles Iñárritu, Birdman is a huge leap for the Mexican filmmaker as he completely reinvents his tone, style & method without discarding the themes that have been an integral part of his entire filmography. Screenplay takes a jab at all things Hollywood & doesn't even spare the critics but it is actually in the fluid execution of these moments where Birdman ends up making its biggest impression.Emmanuel Lubezki is steadily rising as one of the best camera operators around & with Birdman, he adds another impressive feat to his résumé. Apart from its opening & closing moments, the entire picture is presented as one continuous long take for the camera keeps floating from one character to another, even manages to shift through time & different sets without breaking continuity, and works in perfect tandem with editing & digital effects to pull off its gimmick.Coming to the performances, Michael Keaton makes a stunning return to form with a work that's arguably his career-best. But he isn't alone as Edward Norton also chips in a performance we haven't seen from the actor in a long time. And the supporting cast is no slouch either for Emma Stone, Naomi Watts, Zack Galifianakis, Andrea Riseborough, Amy Ryan & Lindsay Duncan do a fine job in their given roles, but Birdman is ultimately Keaton's show all the way from start to finish.On an overall scale, Iñárritu's first foray into the comedy genre has more positives than negatives for his latest is a technical marvel that's ambitious, audacious & astonishing, and yet I can't help but feel slightly underwhelmed by it because it could've done so much more with its self- referential characters, the theater vs film & art vs commerce argument, and its bashing of critics but it unfortunately doesn't. In the end, the most memorable thing about this film isn't its story or characters but its one-shot gimmick. Nevertheless, Birdman comes recommended.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

Birdman - review,"This is a ultra-weird film. You can have many different interpretations about what is happening, and you still won't have a clue. So I'm not going to talk straight about this film because, I feel like I can't. There are so many possibilities to choose from... it's ridiculous.So let's cut to it.The acting in this film is exceptional. Edward Norton steals the show in this film. Michael Keaton is at his best. Emma Stone does her job, but she is breathtaking in one scene. Everyone else pretty much does their job.The score is fantastic. I feel like the music really plays well during each scene.The directing is unusual. I've never seen anything in film like this before. The directing adds a whole other layer to this film.The film is fantastic and it definitely deserves more than one viewing. To sum it all up. Watch this movie. Do you like to be entertained?

The whole film has been worked to look like one single take and this enhances the viewing experience.Michael Keaton proves that he has still got it. His performance as the lead character is astonishing and now he has been nominated for Best Actor at the Academy Awards. He excels at his role, providing a solid and powerful performance.Edward Norton also gives one of his best roles to date. Mike is the egocentric douche bag of the film and he brings his character to life so efficiently that it is far beyond believable. Emma Stone is the other notable performance. Stepping aside from the comedy of Easy A and the loveliness of Gwen Stacy in The Amazing Spider-man franchise, Emma delivers a strong, rehab struggling woman who is just craving for her father's love on the inside.The writing is incredible, you won't find a single piece of dialogue boring and when you have Norton and Keaton on screen together, the chemistry is just mind blowing.Birdman is without a doubt the best film of 2014.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

Throwing mine on the pile...,"Gotta say, with 400+ user reviews at this time, this comment is having trouble feeling significant!But I gotta back up my rating, right? It's simple: The piece feels like the very best of fine theatre, coupled with tremendous filmmaking craft, and yet somehow floating free of the curse of detectable artifice.This flick is an absolute jewel box of semantic riches, like a book that you can open randomly, plunk a finger down, and discover yet-another passage that blows your mind.For example, I was just now reflecting on the scene where the hero faces off the critic in the bar. That scene is a mind-blower, in that it masterfully--if not seemingly inadvertently--mitigates against its own self. The woman decries the death of art, and does so with such force that we could overlook the fact of how that scene shimmers with deep and beautiful artistry.OK, that's one example. This flick is both visual and experiential fine sculpture. In the same way that great sculpture invites you to brave its firehose of beautiful imagery as you circumambulate it, this film is a non-stop cavalcade of beautiful visual impressions and whirling, tumbling humanity.As _Capote_ was for PSH, and _Kill Bill_ was for David Carradine, I sense that _Birdman_ could be the performance of a lifetime for Keaton. Sure, I hope he continues to hew to this kind of daredevilry in the future, but... He has somehow secured something precious and timeless with this flick.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
A Soaring Achievement,"If there's one thing that Birdman proves it's that Michael Keaton can still own a role. This time he is poking fun at the superhero genre and the fact that he has played Batman in the past makes his appearance all the more poignant.Because of the title's more than obvious hint at a superhero, some of us may be forgiven for thinking that the film concerns one. It doesn't. Instead we get a look at the deteriorating career of an actor, one that coincidentally (?) parallels that of the great Keaton. He plays Riggan who in order to restore his falling reputation (he says he turned down Birdman 4, 20 years ago) he decides to direct, write and star in his adaptation of a play no less, but that does not come without consequences and various people to contend with. As if this wasn't enough to make audiences drool we are treated to a magnificent performance from Edward Norton who appears in due course. He gives everything that he possesses with such powerful acting that it rivals his other performances. I would go as far to say his role in 'Fight Club', which astonished audiences everywhere.What follows is one of the greatest films of 2014 and in fact the twenty first century. Even actors I had thought incapable of acting on a dramatic level impress me and that you can be sure is saying something. Particularly Zach Galifianakis (known for is role of a buffoon in 'The Hangover' Series) who shows restraint and a sense of control or some at least over Keaton's character, as his lawyer.The female leads also astonish, namely that of Emma Stone and Naomi Watts – but when have they ever let us down? Stone here is in vast contrast to her role in the 'Spider-Man' series, which was sweet; here she is (dare I say it) bitter with her father, as well as a drug addict and practically uncontrollable. Watts ends up a bit off of the rails, but hey who can blame her?I don't think that anyone would have liked Edward Norton trying to have a quick shag with you before the main event. But there is always some who wouldn't mind. I feel the need to be brief or as brief as is possible for me. It is literally magic on screen from the acting, to the set design, score, cinematography, humour (every joke finds its mark and will have you grasping the air to still breathe) and oh my script! I don't think that one has been as punchy since Aaron Sorkin's for 'The Social Network'.Need I say more? This is the first I have heard of Alejandro González Iñárritu but I will be sure to follow him religiously now.

A washed up superhero,"Birdman is about riggan Thomson(Micheal Keaton)an actor trying to make a comeback by writing,directing, and starring in his own play.

How he directed birdman was something very special and something I've never seen before. He shot birdman so it was one shot throughout the whole movie. The performances were so great by everyone. Of course Micheal Keaton did an amazing job playing this washed up superhero star. Edward Norton and Emma Stone did a great job but one performance that was a surprise was Zach Galifianakis. We are used to him playing a funny role but here he played a serious role and he knock it out of the park.

There are only four flat-out sight gags that I counted, and even those aren't cheap laughs.I gave it a 9, only because I don't think there was enough of Lindsay Duncan's character's arc to power her conflict with Michael Keaton's character.

People really loved making this movie and it shows.I won't talk about the subject much, as it has been talked to death. It's about actors, plain and simple. Michael Keaton plays really well a washed out actor who used to act as a superhero in a famous movie. He steals the show, so to speak, yet I didn't feel the story was about him, but about actors in general, perhaps all people, as actors are caricatures of real men and women. For me the scene that defined the film was the one where Naomi Watts' character goes back to her dressing room, humiliated by her actor boyfriend on stage. When she was a little kid, she wanted to be an actress. And now, that she was playing on Broadway, she still felt like a little kid.Perhaps it is just a gimmick, a movie about actors made by actors for other actors. It feels intelligent, but maybe it is not.

Fruitful Movie,"The movie is simple and quick-play. Not too slow, but that much, as to understand how an elder (Riggan Thomson) strive to survive into a hard competition of Broadway's star system.

The movie is a quick snick look into an actor's soul (Riggan). An person who lived in fame and would prefer ""die hard"" on stage rather sleeping in his corner. What really surprise is director's talent to shot the movie in a such short time (2 months shooting). However, a quick parallelism came into my mind, with Mickey Rourke's playing (The wrestler).

"Ambitious, audacious and soulful","Birdman is like being introduced to a new kind of music or experimental art form with its own internal rhythm. This is entirely due to its unique cinematography by the brilliant Emmanuel Lubezki and especially how it's edited to give the illusion of one continuous take. It helps create a loosely directed, loosely blocked film that feels so improvised yet is a work of incendiary intention.If there is one quality that this film does not possess it's the ability to allow itself to settle. The long takes, tracking shots and lines of dialogue are so quick and snappy it doesn't allow the depth of the themes to grip the viewer in the way that it should. This I suspect will improve upon repeat viewings, yet is somewhat of a mitigating issue. There are also one or two moments that doe require the viewer to take a bit of a leap of faith and the suspension of disbelief. The screenplay is also wickedly funny; it contains many sharp unsettling one liners that provoke howls of searing laughter.It has distant echoes of previous classic Hollywood movies about marginalized actors in the vein of ""Sunset Boulevard"" this frame of reference was also used in the overly adulated awards hit ""The Artist"". It has some of the psychological deliriousness and fantastical realism present in ""Black Swan"". There are also sprinklings of the hilarious calamity and opportunistic ambition of ""The Producers"" these as I have previously mentioned are but distant echoes. The film does feel totally unique and original; I can't say for certain if it makes the viewing experience of the film better or worse for the casual viewer.The question that lies at its core is if its originality is what makes it a masterpiece or a floundering piece of pretentious comedy art. I personally really enjoyed it; it's a terrifically unique viewing experience, it may just prove irksome to the viewer with a passive interest unfortunately.The standout performances here are those of Michael Keaton and Edward Norton. Keaton's character Riggan Thompson is ""staging"" one last attempt at relevancy by writing, directing, financing and starring in a Broadway adaptation of Raymond Carver's Novel ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"" Riggan is a washed up movie stay who acquired fame for playing the titular ""Birdman"" a series of superhero movies from the 90's. As Norton's character mentions in the film it's clear that ""popularity is the slutty little cousin of prestige."" The film contains some scathing indictments and lambasting of the critical community. Riggan berates a critic at one stage shouting about how all she cares about are buzzwords that help to sell magazines and that structure and technique are not evaluated and not given the appropriate weighting to form the critical consensus. This comes after the critic explains to Riggan how she detests his Hollywood acquired sense of self entitlement and self- importance with the lofty presumptions of Broadway success.The interactions between Keaton and Norton's characters are also outstanding there are multiple occasions where they come to blows or get underneath each other's skin in the most childish and petty ways possible.Norton plays a character that is largely a riff off of himself. He is a critically adored, egomaniacal actor one with a massive persona and is difficult to work with. Norton often gets drunk, criticizes the production at any given opportunity, sexually harasses and demeans the actresses and assistants both on and off stage. His drunken explosions of brutal, catastrophic obstinence are a sight to behold. Norton is the best he's been in years. Riggan's hallucinogenic breakdowns are also wonderful with his Birdman persona whispering murmurs of self-doubt in his ear. His alter ego declares his play to be overly pretentious with dumb lines such as ""The kind of love I'm talking about is absolute"" and ""I don't exist"". This sets Riggan into a hilarious downhill spiral of mindless delirium of all shades.In essence Birdman is a movie that is hard to quantify because it contains so many elements that make it so wholly original yet are somewhat inherently problematic in certain small ways. It's not the seminal film for the industry, yet is one that is necessary to help shake up Hollywood's culture and the money grabbing image created movies that it produces. It has most certainly earned its reputation through its monstrously ambitious relentless technical prowess. It is backed up by a well observed, inspired and intelligent screenplay that adds a great amount of heft.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
A technical and creative masterpiece,"Take my advice and go see 'Birdman'. Maybe even watch it a second or a third time. Because, chances are, you're not going to see a film like this again for a very long time. Sure, there will be other great films, other magnificent films that are essential viewing, but films like this don't get made very often. So refreshing to see, in this age of cinema where everything is adapted or reimagined or sequelled, a film that is so utterly original.On the surface, it isn't too different from your standard independent dramedy – twenty years after playing an iconic superhero, washed-up actor Riggan Thomas is writing, directing and starring in a Broadway play. It's the last chance he has to rejuvenate his career, but everything around him is falling apart. His cast; his family; his sanity; it's all going wrong. As opening night draws closer, Riggan teeters closer and closer to the edge.You only need to scratch beneath that surface a tiny little bit to see that 'Birdman' is far from standard. Very ambitiously and very successfully, writer/director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu edits the entire film as though it is one continuous shot. The camera tilts, swivels and slides along in one seamless motion, either chasing after its actors or panning across rooms and storeys. This is not just a technical achievement (a ridiculously big technical achievement, mind) but a creative one. Ensuring it was a success meant the cast essentially working through pages and pages of script, requiring the highest levels of concentration and acting finesse.But don't let all that fool you, this isn't just some fancy party trick – the cinematography does more to enhance the hysteria seen backstage at a theatre production than any montage ever could, and the constant movement of the camera is reflective of the central character's own ever-frenetic mind. Driven by fear, anxiety and pride, Riggan Thomas cannot stop. And the camera moves with him every step of the way.As Riggan, Michael Keaton is simply superb. It's ridiculous to think that it's been four years since he last headlined a movie, and even longer since he got a role as meaty as this. To say he makes the most of the opportunity is beyond an understatement. This was a role made for him, and the metaphysical in-jokes (George Clooney's chin is a lovely reference) only add to the nuances. Riggan Thomas is a man driven by the fear of losing everything, and Keaton expresses it all brilliantly. The sharp script obviously helps, but Keaton's ability to emote just with his eyes, or a twitch, is beautiful to watch. Just like McConaughey, this could see the beginning of Ketaon's resurgence. I sincerely hope so.Everyone else pitches in too, though. Zach Galifianakis' long-suffering producer; Naomi Watts' insecure young actress; Andrea Riseborough's frustrated girlfriend; Amy Ryan's exhausted ex-wife; they're all excellent in relatively small but significant roles. But of the supporting cast, Emma Stone and Edward Norton are a cut above. Norton is hilarious as the Broadway veteran, difficult to work with in his undying effort to find 'truth' on stage (mirroring Norton's own storied behavioural issues). Emma Stone, too, is just incredible. It's a character that starts off looking quite generic – young daughter out of rehab who doesn't give a crap about anyone – but she comes into her own in a big way. Stealing every scene she's in, including a fantastic final few seconds, Stone shows once again why she is one of the best actresses out there right now.There are a lot of big movies coming out this year – your Stars Wars and your Marvels – but this is already a frontrunner for movie of the year. Technically and creatively, 'Birdman' is a cinematic triumph, and a brilliant way to start the year. If this is the calibre of cinema we have to look forward to, we're in for a ride.So please. Go and watch 'Birdman'. And then think about watching it again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
I missed Downton Abbey for this?,"I agree with many reviewers that it deserves a 10 for figuring out the impossible logistics of the ultra extended single shot. Gimmicky, yes, but it works. Chapeau to all involved in figuring it out. In the end however, it comes down to being engaged in a story that moves you. I admire that G. In/arritu takes risks (by the way why'd he change his name from Gonzalez In/arritu to just G. In/arritu? What's wrong with Gonzalez? Sounds like his Hollywood agent had a talk with him), but the risks he takes seem too 'Rebuscados' - trying too hard to be cool, different, smart, innovative, meta. Michael Keaton? OK, he's playing a washed up superhero actor who's trying to find meaning again. But it would have worked better if he'd played himself - the superhero should have been Batman not Birdman. I love Emma Stone but that monologue? Rebuscado. Not her fault. It was the writing/directing. Cut the monologue and she deserves the Oscar.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"Masterpiece, one of the best of 2014","This is without a doubt the best 2014 film I have seen. It's very original and out there, the whole film is shot as it it were one long take with no cuts whatsoever (a great feat on part of both the actors and director Alejandro González Iñárritu). The acting in Birdman is absolutely spot on; for me every single actor in this film gave me their best performance I've seen. This can particularly be said for Edward Norton (who I believe should win Oscar for Best Supporting Actor from this), Michael Keaton (showing new depths as an actor I've not seen from him, and a performance which will certainly be unforgettable for most that have seen him) and Emma Stone (who is as wonderful as she usually is). The story is crafted excellently, with the plot always being different and interesting, and making you care about what's going on with all the characters. The only small problem I have with this film is the ambiguous ending, but I don't have too much of a problem with that. I have no reservations whatsoever about giving this film 5 stars, it is now my second favourite film of all time. The score (unfortunately deemed 'not eligible' for the best score Oscar) is brilliant, for the most part being some excellent drum work, always fitting perfectly and building tension. If you haven't seen this I cannot stress enough how much you should go to the cinema and watch this; it's a real treat for any fans of cinema out there.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
I'm really sad that such a callow filmmaker has won the Oscar for making such a lackluster drama!,"The moral of the story is annoyingly unabashedly on-the-nose. I'm glad the protagonist has figured out a way to deal with the nose at the end. Adding insult to injury, It's safe to say that Iñárritu went too far with this surrealist denouement. Plus, the film is really overlong. Actually, I think the entire last thirty minutes should have been dealt with the same way Riggan has dealt with his nose. Besides, there must be a boring scene every now and then that is also somewhat pointless. I believe this is a result of the overstuffed nature of the plot. I don't reckon there's anything worse than a pretentious plot with a lackluster execution.(1 star out of 5)",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Pretty good.,"This movie is listed as a comedy and a drama. While I didn't find it that funny, it definitely works as a drama. I'm not a very big fan of drama, but its done incredibly well in this movie. All the performances are absolutely fantastic. My favorite thing about this movie is that its cheated to look like it was all done in one take. The camerawork is fluid and impressive. There are multiple scenes with mirrors that, while they serve a purpose for the story, seem to just exist to show off the skills of the people who made this. I can see why people wouldn't like this movie, but I would definitely recommend it to fans of great cinematography, and anyone who likes watching characters that are so well-written and acted that they feel like real people.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"Birdman is a black comedy with elements of magical realism, presented as raw drama.","Riggan is a washed-up actor who tries to claw his way back to relevance by staging a Broadway play.As he prepares, he's surrounded by crazy family, friends and colleagues in one big, beautiful surrealistic swirl. This film shook me to the core. Michael Keaton delivers an amazing performance in the midst of a stellar cast. If you're looking to go more meta than you've gone in a while, go see Birdman.The most intriguing aesthetic element of the film is how it appears to be one continuous shot. Of course, it isn't actually shot like this, but the brilliant camera-work and editing provide this glorious illusion.I love that Birdman is almost a nod to Keaton having played Batman all those years ago, making this movie more meta than what most people can handle. This unapologetic film asks bold questions about the movie industry and the people in it; making it a brilliant form of introspection for the cast and their peers. The main character, Riggan is a personification of all actors (the idea of an actor as a construct), caught in the purgatory between art and the spectacle.I'd love to compare it to something else, but I really can't. It's such a unique piece of work.Anyone can enjoy this film, except the blunt instrument. Speaking of instruments, the score is also absolutely stunning.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Terrible movie,"The whole movie could have been done in 20 minutes. Plot has very little substance, and so does the movie.Many filler scenes which add very little to the plot and do not advance the story much.This movie left me with the feeling from the very beginning that it was going to ""start"" and that the story was going to develop at any point, all the way until the end. That's when I thought ""oh, so that's it really?""In short, nothing much happened in the story and this movie was just a huge disappointment, don't waste your money or time.Oh and another thing, the scenes shown in the trailer were mostly the only interesting scenes in the movie, other than that it was very lame.

"There you go, you motherf*****!","As a movie enthusiast (having in mind true qualities that make a film worthwhile when using this label), Birdman just DID IT. It delivered. It reminded me why i love films so much.Without giving anything away, it's hard to review this film to give it the credit it deserves, but here goes. Michael Keaton gives the performance of his life, you just gotta love him. He plays a washed up actor with his alter-ego-from-the-past torturing his mind and he portrays this brilliantly - every man's inner battle shown on film. Emma Stone is great also, Edward Norton, well, he's excellent as expected, and i'm glad Zach Galifianakis got his screen time, i think he's a great actor too.The story is great, the music too, you'll see what i mean by 'music'. The way the movie is shot also blew my mind, Iñárritu is a damn genius. I'd love to say more, but don't want to spoil anything.Birdman is the movie of the year and the one you just have to see, if you enjoy cinema. Frankly, it's one of the best films i've ever seen. It's entertaining, deep, makes you think, laugh... Birdman. Gravity doesn't even apply to it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
I don't get what the hate is for,"I went into this film with the expectation of being highly impressed or highly disappointed, and it was most definitely the former. The execution of everything was flawless from the cinematography to Keaton's hauntingly moving performance. I read many negative reviews that said the film was too pretentious or that the plot moved too slowly. All I can say is that those people just prove Birdman's genius. You don't want to watch a movie with an accurate representation of American society and instead curl up with Michael Bay's Transformers because you're so stimulated by the CGI be my guest. The movie satirizes itself so brilliantly that it even points out its own drab depiction of theater, saying that all people care about are multimillion dollar films with action and destruction; not the skill of acting, writing, or directing. Keaton succeeds in rejuvenating the seemingly lost art of theater while giving his career a return to greatness. Whether you hated this film or loved it, everyone can agree that its depiction of humanity's inflated ego was met with some humility and made you think long and hard after viewing. Bravo, Birdman. You created something worth talking about, and that's all that we needed from this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"not a work of art, but a work of class.","I have read and heard people having issues with this movie such as it is boring (suckers don't get it), the movie is trying so hard to win Oscars (which it is not), the movie is basically pointless (well some people are plain blind) etc.Of course the cast had pre installed my interest level in the movie and for that purpose i tried my best that i scrutinize the movie with diligence and come up with a rational and precise review.for the most part, the first half is slow, not necessarily boring. It is perhaps the most important part in the movie because what happens later is based on what they are setting you up for. every expression, every act, every scene is a an expression that is trying to talk to its viewer. in years, I have watched a movie that has a first part which talks to its viewer through actors, script AND direction so vaguely because it MEANT to. Since this part is so delicate that most people lose it here and make judgements about the movie such as being a wanna be artsy film or being boring. More like it is a threshold for REAL movie critics and wanna be movie critics.Once you get past this beautiful slow paced first half, every story and character begins to unfold into something magical. Everything speaks to you vividly and if you grabbed the first part right, this genre gives you the shock of a thriller.In all my honesty, it is one of the most spectacular movies I have ever watched. It leaves you with mixed emotions that you don't know whether to cry or to laugh about what happened since it elaborates the feeble world of Hollywood and the extent of loyalty to what you believe in, both at the same time.The movie is not a wannabe artsy which it is not yet it is a piece of art.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Birdman Is An Instant Classic,"I can't remember the last time I've so passionately loved a film. Walking out of the theater, I was literally weak in the knees.Birdman is everything I love about film as an art form: it's bold, incredibly original, emotionally rich, gorgeously shot, and unmistakably energetic and alive. It's about how art and life are hopelessly intertwined, how people's lives, egos, opinions, have all become clichés of art, people searching for true meaning and social acceptance in the murky battleground of the stage, fantasy vs reality, past vs present, popularity vs prestige, criticism of criticism, the jumble of life's mysteries. Birdman balances these ideas beautifully and delivers them ferociously, angrily. The characters constantly rant and rave to each other about how phony everyone is, about who is most passionate and real, how theater audience are rich white people whose only care is where they're going to eat after the show, how movie audiences are morons who only care about shootouts and superheroes. These ideas are bitter and acerbic and they're the true heart of the film. One of my very favorite scenes features Sam, Riggan's daughter, explaining to him how a roll of toilet paper that has 150 dots on each square, each dot symbolizing 100,000 years, is like the history of Earth. Sam says that humans represent only a single square of toilet paper on the entire roll, which really puts into perspective just how self-obsessed we are and how all of our self-doubt and truth-searching are ultimately meaningless in the grand scheme of things; how if humans are negligible, so is art, and vice versa. We're only as meaningful as we say we are: this is an idea displayed in the movie by Riggan's ability to bend the laws of physics. Sometimes, he genuinely believes he has the powers of his superhero alter ego, and by simply believing, he possesses these abilities. This is just incredible! I could go on for pages about the films themes and ideas, but it also has an extremely impressive technical side to discuss.The experience of Birdman is like a stream-of-consciousness jazz piece that lasts for 2 hours and doesn't let up or slacken for a moment. Alejandro Iñárritu and Emmanuel Lubezki (probably the greatest cinematographer of our generation) shot Birdman in what is mainly supposed to look like one uninterrupted take. Similar to Hitchcock's Rope, but the one-take technique is both more captivating and meaningful in this case. It brings a strange surrealism to the whole experience which highlights the blending of real life with fantasy/art. The constantly moving and unblinking camera eye also does wonders in making the audience feel like they themselves are part of the story, a genuinely brilliant decision that rewards attentive viewers with a unique, transcendent experience. The score is almost entirely percussive and feels much like the pulse of Birdman. When the camera is moving and so are the characters, the drums kick in, but when the camera is still and the tone turns dramatic or melancholy, they sputter out.Now, on to the performances, and this is a huge category. The entire cast is brilliant and there are absolutely no exceptions. The players themselves are like jazz musicians that feed off of each other's vibes and energy to create some kind of sweeping, orchestral odyssey. Michael Keaton and Edward Norton are arguably playing exaggerated versions of themselves, which adds to the innumerable layers of satire already at work. Keaton as Riggan shows off his entire acting range and gives what is without a doubt the best performance I've seen from him. Norton is more of a straight-up douche, but he still radiates intelligence and a mysterious yearning. Zach Galifianakis is one of those comedians that I thought could be a great dramatic actor if he wanted to, and my thoughts were confirmed with his small, impressive performance here . Emma Stone shocked me with her powerful yet intimate portrayal of Riggan's young, ex-drug addict daughter and delivers Birdman's most memorable ranting scene as well as some of the film's most tantalizing and thought- provoking bits. The extraordinary female cast is rounded out with great efforts by Naomi Watts, Amy Ryan, Andrea Riseborough, and Lindsay Duncan.I'm elated to have finally seen Birdman. My expectations were high going in but were completely blown away, which almost never happens. Iñarritu and company have created a funny, exciting, thought-provoking, and all around jaw-dropping masterpiece that deserves every award it's got coming to it. Birdman is the best of the 216 movies I've seen so far this year, and is generally one of the best movie-going experiences I've ever had. Easiest 10 I think I've ever given.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Brilliant,"Birdman is a film that left me feeling truly raw as I walked out of the cinema the first night I saw it, in fact, I have been turning it over in my mind for the past two weeks since I witnessed the (obvious) best film of the year, picking apart the beautiful details. Now, there are only a few movies I will watch over again within the same year, but I saw Birdman in the cinema for a second time a week after my first viewing and bought it on Blu-Ray.The cinematography is flawless, even revolutionary. Each scene seamlessly stitched together with passionate craftsmanship that can only be accomplished by cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, who recently won an Oscar for his work on Gravity.Director Alejandro González Iñárritu has been quoted as saying that he intended for Birdman to be ""a cinematic desert."" And that is being modest. This movie truly feels like a breath of fresh air in the film industry because of its creativity and originality. Now, I have only given five other films a 10 out of 10 rating, this being the sixth. Those films include The Godfather, Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Pulp Fiction and The Big Lebowski.The technical aspect of this film is obviously extraordinarily noteworthy, but how is the acting? In one word. Radiant. Michael Keaton gives the performance of a lifetime as a washed up actor who's ego is far beyond what it should be. Emma Stone, Ed Norton and Zach Galifianakis have also never been better. In fact, they are all Oscar Worthy, except for maybe Zach Galifianakis, but that's only due to his abbreviated screen time.I also loved how it touched on the expectations of movie goers today and their opinions on what they want to see when watching a blockbuster film,as well as film critics and how all they ever do is use big unnecessary words to avoid actually reviewing films and look for a good quotes to put on the posters and DVD covers.I predict that this film will age very well and hopefully resonate in the thoughts of moviegoers and critics alike. And there is no reason why Birdman shouldn't sweep the 2015 Academy Awards.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"Funny, satirical take on modern show-biz, albeit a bit over-rated.","I really had a fun two hours watching this film. It was brilliantly crafted, and some of the dialogue was classic. However, I cannot consider this film a masterpiece simply for its witty dialogue or its technical and artistic merits alone.Sadly, Birdman: the unexpected virtue of ignorance lacked deep characters. Keaton's plight never made them worthy of any emotional involvement on my part. The thing is...that the jokes didn't match the tone of the cast's acting because the performances were realistic. If this film had a slap- stick element to it, then it would've worked a bit better for this story.I do believe this film should win awards for the directorial effort and writing but as for Keaton--well, he wasn't bad at all, but he was out- staged by Ed Norton--who was fantastic in this film! I know this film will win plenty of statues this coming Sunday, but perhaps it deserves only a couple.Nevertheless, its worth a rent. After all, how many films deserve ONLY a couple of Oscars right?

A spoiler-free introduction to Birdman,"READ THIS FIRST: I give an abstract description of what happens in the film without describing any actual content. Therefore, this review is quite (though not entirely) spoiler free, but if you simply want an answer to the question: 'Should I watch Birdman?' I recommend skipping to the end!Birdman is a film about the kind of life Michael Keaton might have, starring Micheal Keaton.This premise is excellent and was to me reason enough to go see Birdman. Furhermore, the acting is excellent by every single cast member and the direction is original and compelling, effectively entwined with the motives of the film. The theater feels claustrophobic and the odd transitions maintain a feel of unpredictability. There is also a continuity in the filming that is very well executed. From a professional perspective, Birdman delivers.But there's also a lot of things that Birdman is not, that you may expect it to be from trailers: Birdman is not a superhero movie in any obvious or direct sense. It is for the most part about the work and life in theater. The charge that this is pretentious is understandable: someone who comes into Birdman expecting an eccentric work of art won't be disappointed, but someone who expects to be easily entertained will find it bothersome.The first three-quarters of the film are tense and exciting for anyone who feels the impending doom of a show about to fall apart (a tension comparable to that of Misses Doubtfire), but this tension borders on anxiety inducing. None of the characters feel strongly relatable, each rendered unpredictable by their own Freudian struggles; as a result, the cynical voice of Birdman in the head of main protagonist Riggan Thomson (Keaton) becomes oddly comforting. Mike Shines (Norton) personifies this unpredictability: he is a despicable human being who cares only about what happens on stage, making him an ideal artist and a scumbag simultaneously.While Mike Shines personifies Riggan's professional effort to create legitimate art, he is also confronted with his personal life, particularly his detachment with it. All the characters display their personal flaws in a believably (though perhaps a little rushed), but those of Riggan are most credible. He is tormented by his loss of celebrity relevance, and although he loves his daughter and ex-wife, he has convinced himself he needs his fame to earn their respect.This forms the triad of values in his life: family, art, and fame. Riggan has trouble separating these three. He tries to become relevant again by doing theater, something he considers real art contrary to his Birdman career. In doing so, he hopes to win the respect of his ex-wife and daughter. Yet his work is overshadowed by Birdman who explicitly torments him with the questions: Aren't you doing all this for celebrity and fame? Then why not just make Birdman 4?The pretentiousness of the entire first part of the film comes mostly from the jokes about actors and how shallow their dreams may be or seem. This, combined with the anxiously unpredictable atmosphere that surrounds the theater, makes the first part of the film a little difficult to watch. Yet the movie all builds up to a wonderful climax that literally transcends the entirety of the first part of the film and requires the petty personal quarrels of all these characters, only to be forgotten right after.It is Riggan's eventual identification with Birdman that creates the continuity in his life, work and fame, not elegantly or clearly, but flawed with paradox. This forms a beautiful conclusion: Riggan may be old, flawed, even confused, but he was and is Birdman. And Birdman can fly.RECOMMENDATION: In summary, Birdman deals with the struggles of artists who must navigate their lives around their work, popularity and personal lives. This struggle is presented in a way that is easy to understand, though perhaps not always pleasant to watch. The contemporary theme of heroism is very fitting, though only a minor part of the film. I highly recommend Birdman to anyone who feels they can relate to the artist's struggle.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Saved by the Performances,"Birdman is an odd film that succeeds largely on the basis of its performances. It follows the inner life of a washed up Hollywood actor, famous for playing the eponymous superhero, as he tries to do a Broadway adaption of the works of Raymond Chandler. Michael Keaton is great in the lead and has an excellent supporting cast, but the film comes across as too pretentious for its own good.There is not enough praise in a small review for the performances in this film. Michael Keaton's work in the lead should cement a comeback and earn him an Academy Award nomination in the bargain. However, the true highlights of the cast are Edward Norton as an obnoxious co-star and Emma Stone as Keaton's troubled daughter. Both actors steal every scene they are in and deserve to win Oscars for their work. Norton embodies the ego-maniacal actor while still managing to keep his character likable, even after what is arguably an attempted rape. Stone conveys her character's vulnerability without making her pathetic. Zach Galifianakis also does well as Keaton's business partner.The film also explores some very interesting themes, such as the relationship between filmmaking as art and the production of mindless blockbusters. There is also a thought-provoking discussion of film criticism and the attitudes critics bring to actors and their work. There are scenes that will make armchair critics (...cough) think before they trash a film or play someone has worked hard on.However, Birdman is hampered by a pretentious atmosphere that undermines the appeal of the actors. The framing of the film as one continuous shot is distracting and comes across as showing off by the cinematographer. Furthermore, the more whimsical elements of the film feel out of place at times, occasionally leaving the viewer to wonder what is really happening and what is in Keaton's head. This is especially true at the conclusion. Still, the performances make the film worth watching.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
A movie for readers !,"Alejandro González Iñárritu completely moves away from his previous work that has included deep and tragic movies such as '21 grams' and 'Babel' with this comical and at the same time meaningful look at a man's rise and fall. 'Birdman' is a film where very few recent movies have dared to go, based on a production on 'Broadway' and its many characters with their fears and ambitions. Each character portrays a different stage in a person's life with the final stage being that of 'Riggan Thomson', a struggling veteran who is hoping for one last shot at glory after his only previous claim to fame was being the face behind a superhero called 'Birdman'. On the surface this is a simple plot but the depth of this movie is how it shows different human emotions, ambitions and aspirations. The film is addictive, with its great performances where every star is so well placed in a low key role and Michael Keaton towering above as the 'Superhero' and the struggling director, writer and actor of a Broadway production. If you are a reader, this movie is for you because it goes further than most movies dare to go! @zulfmanauthor",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Is it too early to call Birdman the film of 2015?,"Birdman is Ace!I have to preface this review of Birdman by saying that this kind of film was right up my street. As an independently minded, foreign director helmed, black comedy film featuring recently sub- par actors (Keaton, Galifianakis, Watts) who were pulling out the all the stops I loved the idea at conception.Then I saw the the film and was blown away from it from the first scene and sentence. Birdman is genuinely inventive on many counts. Firstly, the idea of the story progressing ""one take"" propagated by a steady cam and invisible edit points was astonishing. I have not been taken in by such inventive cinematography since Gravity, so it was no surprise that it was shot by the same DP (Director of Photography) as Gravity was; Emmanuel Lubezki. Secondly, the way that the minimalist jazz drum score drives the film forward was fantastic. I now have the soundtrack on constant repeat.Thirdly, the genius casting of Michael Keaton to reference to a failing actor from a film franchise. Who else could it have been? Val Kilmer's Batman? Brendan Routh's Superman? Michael Crawford's Condorman? None of the above would have sufficed! In SummaryIt should be noted that all these points would add up to a gimmicky if it wasn't for the story and the way that it unfolds. Riggan Thomas, Keaton, seems to have everyone against him; his daughter, his ex-wife, his new-love interest, his manager, his fellow actors and that strange hidden ""Birdman"" character push and pull him in multiple directions. It's impossible to know which way he could turn.On top of all this it is genuinely funny! I love it when you leave a film and you aren't quite sure what happened and you know that you'll have to watch it again and soon.K*",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Stunning in every way...a gripping and beautiful marvel,"Birdman (2014)A tour-de-force imaginative wild ride. Every aspect has been pushed just slightly into creative territory—though you won't mistake this for an art film. It's a high budget, very slick, very approachable melding of drama and cinema, the intimate and the polished slick big drama you expect from Hollywood.I say Hollywood, but in a way this is an outsider film. The director, producer, and writer is Alejandro González Iñárritu, rising Mexican director who pulled off the impressive ""Biutiful"" and further back, ""Babel."" And whatever the astonishing contributions of actors Michael Keaton, Edward Norton and the host of others (including Emma Stone), and whatever the equally astonishing contributions of cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki (""Tree of Life,"" ""Gravity,"" and ""Children of Men"" for starters) and composer Antonio Sanchez, it is Iñárritu who makes this all gel, makes it vivid, and makes it make sense. Watch all these people over the next couple decades, but most of all watch him.You might say that this movie suffers from over-production, from being too amazing, from avoiding truly human qualities and human issues by rising above and being a sensation. Fine. Skip it. Watch ""Amour"" over and over. I love those movies, too, but that doesn't leave this out. It's a great example of combining the formal elements of movie-making with interesting plot and great acting. It's true that it makes a gloss of anything tender and intimate, even if at times it seems to try for depth, but overall it does what it really intends to very well.For those who do like astonishing camera-work, don't miss this. The film is shot as if done in one single long take, camera moving with cunning fluidity through rooms, hallways, streets, and theater spaces without stop. Ever. There are clearly times where a break is snuck in, or one is implied (the camera is continuous but the time of day is not, and we see an actor in front of us that was just somewhere else). But if a long take is immersive (that's its point, to create the sense of now and extend it and extend it so that you feel involved), this long take of a movie is so immersive it's spellbinding. For two hours.Add the free form drumming, which at first is almost irritating in its offbeat asynchrony, and add some stunning lighting from scene to scene, and you have an elegantly jarring movie. But then you realize, with this intense acting (all extremely well done), that the script is also superb. What they are saying and arguing about and proposing to each other in interwoven ways as this ensemble cast digs in is really interesting. It's not quite glib or flashy or superficial even if the movie has pushed it all to an extreme.Yeah, see this. A pleasure and an impressive feat.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Birdman rises,"What to say about this movie? Immediately I was sold after about 5 minutes and enthusiasm lasted until the very end. Performed Keaton, shooting angles, long scenes, simple music (drums), even I thought this movie autobiographical (due Keaton) because there are a lot of links with his career (a failed actor who is best known for his role as Batman), and after that he did not have any good role (who will first mention Jackie Brown or maybe My life?) and now is trying to get back into acting through its theater play (movie Birdman). The film is full of interesting facts and, to me personally, was not at all boring as others. References to the actual film world were perfect. I almost did standing ovation in cinema when it ended. I have some objections, but very small. I give it 9.5 and to sum up the 10. Congratulations, this is the right thing for all film lovers.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Captivating troughout,"From start to finish this beautiful piece grabs you by the wazzoo and forces you on a thoroughly engaging journey. The viewer is dragged along with no choice in the matter, and this is the movie's strong suit. The whole aesthetic, the rugged visuals, the incredible drums and the rapid dialogue, all make for thrilling non-stop stimuli with few moments of respite. This beautiful chaos is perfectly executed. As for the message - fantastically put. Excellent acting throughout and the somehow made Emma Stone attractive also. Super memorable and unique piece of art.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
One of the Best Films Ever Made.,"I have been an avid film lover all my life, for as long as I can remember, film has been a place of comfort to me, a place to laugh and distract myself, as well as focus on my sorrows and breathe into the life of another world. Birdman is a very important film to me. Not only do I feel it shines the light on mental illness, show business, fame, as well as so many other important topics- but it tells it so honestly, so genuinely, and without taking any stops or shortcuts along the way. I think the film is a masterpiece, in every way imaginable. I didn't expect much from the film when I first saw it, I heard good things about it, but also some mixed reactions, so I tried to keep an open mind throughout. I was blown away when first watching it, and since then, I've watched it nearly a dozen times. Michael Keaton was truly robbed for not winning the Best Actor Oscar in 2014, and I truly believe it is his best performance to date, which is saying a lot because I love him as an actor. Emma Stone is also incredible on screen, also my favorite performance from her. I love La La Land as well as her performance in it, but c'mon, she is so much better here than she ever was in any other film. The supporting cast is great, I especially appreciated Ed Norton, Lindsay Duncan, and Naomi Watts- each providing very memorable performances among a cast of incredibly talented people. Norton gets more time to shine, but I think Duncan provides one of the most important roles, and truly no one could have done it better than her. The cinematography is fantastic, in fact it's my favorite of any film period. The script is brilliant, the direction even better, and the pacing is taut and absolutely perfect. There isn't a single dull moment in Birdman, nor is there anything bad about it. It's a truly divine piece of cinema, and i'm not ashamed to call it one of the best films ever made.
My Rating: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"A very divisive film for sure, like art","I've read a number of reviews, and am aware that this film won many awards. I have to admit, this is really different from most films out there, with a sombre theme, regarding the terrible state of affairs for actors in Broadway. People who want to make it big but realise it is very different from what they imagined but they are stuck in too deep to extricate themselves, those who have overwhelming egos and seek to destroy everyone but themselves, the very common theme of substance abuse and some other marriage or personality flaws etc.The execution and presentation was interesting, with the normal band music or OSTs replaced by drumming and there being little real music, so we can actually hear what the actors and actresses say in their entirety.The issue I have instead is with the story itself, and the addition of many unrelated scenes, which seem to point to somewhere else. For example, right at the beginning, a few scenes hinted that this would be a superhero film, with Riggan Thomson wielding certain powers. Which made things confusing here and there. Yes, like art it is supposed to be abstract, and many scenes seem to suggest something, then later some scenes depict something else. This sort of directing and redirecting certain focus here and there is what makes this film unique, yet when one really reflects on it, I guess I don't really know what I have been watching. More importantly, which scenes are real, and which are not?To keep it simple and spoiler-free, all I will say is it's a make-or-break basically, looking at the reviews I see either very low scores or very high scores. Kind of interesting, for me it's quite mediocre, and frankly, a depressing film to watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"Note on Riggan's dressing room mirror: A thing is a thing, not what is said of that thing.","Michael Keaton earned a well-deserved Academy Award nomination for playing Riggan Thompson, a film turned stage actor. He was famous for playing the Birdman in the movies. In this film, he wants to succeed on Broadway in a play. Emma Stone played his daughter, Sam. Edward Thornton played his co-star in the play. Zach Galifankis played a producing partner in the production. Filmed on location in New York City, the film is about temperamental actors and the process being one. The film is somewhat entertaining except I can't stand the bird costume. Michael Keaton does a tour-de-force performance as Riggan, an unusual name. The film won an Academy Award for Best Picture. The film is quite entertaining especially with the cast. The ending doesn't make sense though.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"Notes addressed for those who watched: ""Birdman""","Beginning by what the film has plainly to tell us (what's to say: by some quotes):""Popularity is the slutty little cousin of prestige"";""The unexpected virtue of ignorance"";""A thing is a thing, not what is said of that thing"";""Truth is always more interesting"";Let's treat ""birdman"" as a clay concept that we can manage its meaning along the text.So, a first consideration: ""birdman"" is about being OVER society, like flying over it, or is about been OUT OF society, as it was possible to be away from what society produces in terms of concepts, expectations, responsibilities, consuming behaviors, etc?Now, does a ""birdman"" still a man, although half man/half bird? Or the fusion mischaracterizes both the concept of ""man"" and ""bird"" in a way that ""birdman"" doesn't keep any correspondence with the two others?When we get to this considerations, it automatically comes to mind the following: ""birdman"" as a hollywoodean character is something far different from Riggan-the-actor? Does the stage and the behind-spotlights share anything in common? Real life and its opposite — whatever it may imply — shares anything in common?The unjustified search of fame, socially described as an indicator of a successful career, are more likely to refer to a ""birdman"" OVER society, meaning that the efforts by Riggan of getting the critique and also the general acclaim with his play go all in the intention of separate him of the normal people and the normal life, get him — once again, and who watched will understand — in the spot regardless of the play. Continuing, all go in the intention of transforming him in some ""idol"" that stands over society, but logically demands its existence, even better if all of its attention points to the idol — than comes to stage the social medias, the cultural industry and so on.However, if ""the popularity is the slutty little cousin of prestige"", in what the search for fame differs from the search for making an oeuvre d'art? Woudn't this two have the same roots, if we agree with the fact that the ""real"" artist searches recognition for the posterity (prestige?), searches for being an idol as well? And the ""real"" qualifier is a trick here 'cause the one-take- that-goes-beyond-days film is always joking with our conceptions of ""real"" and ""unreal"", ""truth"" and ""lie"", ""play"" and ""reality"", mixing and confounding it all, in an exercise of dialectics.And that ""remember note"" in Riggan's mirror which says ""a thing is a thing, not what is said of that thing"" could be a provocation: who would be able to say what is and what is not art? What is worth of been played at Broadway — doubtless an idol in our society — and what is not? Maybe no one and, at the same time, we all. Because ""art"" is ""art"" and not what we say about it, we should trace the path to its ""truth"", its ""essence"" in order to state what it is, but this task is so contaminated and determined by the social language we were taught to speak that we could never reach any ""truth"" of anything, as it doesn't actually exist, as ""real"" and ""unreal"", ""truth"" and ""lie"", ""play"" and ""reality"", again, was really different perspectives of seen things — like a method of looking to world and describing it — and not just some mess up of the director (Riggan or Inirratu?).So, we are all allowed to build our parameters of ""truth"". And ""truth is always more interesting"" right because it ins't something solid and fixed, but fluid — as the film is, thanks to the production's techniques choices — and dialectical.And this is how ""the unexpected virtue of ignorance"" could be meaning: different from what our traditional philosophical standards says, we could revolutionize all the constellation of concepts socially built and that are all around us, determining us all the time; we could give any sense to any word according to our will — we could give a scientific status to ""ignorance"", crystallizing it as a virtue. Cultural industry — Hollywood, Broadway ... — has been always creating meanings and idols according to is own purposes. We could create our own world too, maybe even against what is given to us already built up and maybe this act would be an ""real"" act of ""art"" from somebody's perspective.Lastly, maybe the ""birdman"" that stands inside us and that is quite opposite to all this media things and fame and so on, is that one flying OUT OF society, society in terms of a bunch of concepts, the source of a language the allows us to communicate within objective symbols, a language sometimes oppressive and despotic which works to the establishment (Foucault?), but flying out to an another society — or, more precisely, an another language — in which even some physical laws are reinterpreted — as the theater does —, in which even some reactions are reinterpreted — to which Emma's smile at the last act of the film is so expressive of (relief, happiness ...?).",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
A waste of great acting talents,"A product of a schizophrenic, decaying mind with short sequences of excellent acting... Well, this was all what I had to say but according to the IMDb rules, now I will have to write 10+ lanes, so here it goes. I was sorry for the great actors who had to participate in this ""artistic"" craziness. All characters are just wondering around along with the camera during the movie, seemingly not knowing at all what they should do or say. So most of the time they just say something randomly and act according to that. I was really surprised that it got so good reviews. Nevertheless, short sequences are played great e.g. Emma Stone with Edward Norton on the balcony. That short sequence alone made me learn Emma Stone's name - she is truly fantastic. Well I hope it is already 10 lanes. Why do I have to write 10 lanes minimum anyway? That is as crazy as this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
It is what it is.,"There's nothing I can write in this review that wouldn't be hypocritical; to say anything is to fall prey to Birdman's point. A caustic satire on The Method that pontificates of what art really means, this film is thoroughly engrossing. It is a bolt from the blue and the more times I watch the more I am convinced it beyond words and description.I think my appreciation of the film can be summed up in a single, but not simply, question. Is Keaton actually acting in the film?I will also remark that it isn't hard to get this narrative into actual superhero tropes. After all, before the big show, a penultimate showdown with the actor's nemesis, i.e. the critic, takes place. Nemesis monologues about how she will destroy the world-sorry I mean play-and her plan to do so.This is Birdman",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
I feel for Michael Keaton!,"Michael Keaton did not win Oscar as best actor in a leading role, Eddie Redmayne won instead for his role in ""The Theory of Everything"".

Boyhood is a good film and was a good contender. There is no doubt about it, but the better film took the award. This film left a long lasting effect on me. Even after so many years, I still think of this movie as a great one. And I genuinely feel for Michael Keaton, he should have won!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"""My Play. Why? Because I'm Birdman!""","Birdman is the pure definition of film making at its finest. I know this wasn't his first film, but as his first breakout film, Alejandro G. Iñárritu envisioned a script so witty and thought-provoking that only a true visionary like him would be behind the camera to understand. The message underlines what acting and the box office truly means to a person even if the main populist is indifferent whether blockbusters or artistic art should be the ones praised. Honestly, all of this couldn't have been possible without the phenomenal actors attached to the film with Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, and Emma Stone being the stand out performances. Don't even get me started with the excellent editing, long-takes, cinematography and drum score that elevates the experience to an even greater one. There is a reason why this film is praised and dares others to soar above the ground like Riggan himself.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"'Birdman' is not a masterpiece as cited by many, but it is an instigating, dynamic film, full of references and that makes us reflect in different ways","Anyone who follows the career of Alejandro G. Iñárritu knows that the Mexican director deals with controversial topics, he is one of the few that invests mainly those marginalized and discriminated against by society. That was the case in Amores Brutos (2000), 21 Grams (2003) and Babel (2006). The Mexican director's films have several stories or 'arcs', where different nuclei of characters develop, whether or not they can cross, and this time he follows the same motto, but bringing innovation in the filming mode.In the past, Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) was very successful playing Birdman, a superhero who has become a cultural icon. However, since he refused to star in the fourth film with the character, his career has started to decline. In search of lost fame and also recognition as an actor, he decides to direct, script and star in the adaptation of a consecrated text for Broadway. However, amid rehearsals with the cast of Mike Shiner (Edward Norton), Lesley (Naomi Watts) and Laura (Andrea Riseborough), Riggan must deal with his agent Brandon (Zach Galifianakis) and a strange voice that insists on remaining in your mind.Undoubtedly, 'Birdman' is the most daring work in Iñárritu's career so far. If in his previous films, most of them were worked on the editing island, true puzzles, the director's ability consists especially in innovating by filming practically everything in sequence, making the camera, sometimes faster, sometimes more calmly follow parallel plots that intertwine all the time, following not only the perspective of the protagonist Riggan Thomson, but also of all the other characters. At the same time, the viewer's gaze is guided by the director to follow the troubled relationship between the dreamy aspiring Brodway actress, Lesley with temperamental actor Mike Shiner and obviously Riggan with his lawyer, agent and best friend Brandon, with his ex-wife. , with the news of a possible pregnancy of one of the actresses in her play, with her daughter Sam (Emma Stone), besides having to deal with the problems behind the scenes of her new play and the fear of criticism, of that work that could be his triumphant return to the spotlight.The director makes a collage of references in the black humor drama ranging from Godard to Hitchcock and Sokurov. It has discreet influences from The American Night (1973) and The Player (1992). The montage, as in Festim Diabólico (1948) or Arca Russa (2002), engages long sequential shots with cuts at barely noticeable key moments, simulating a film that is totally unassembled. And this showing 99% of the time the tatro and its backstage, making the camera walk through the corridors, make-up rooms, costumes, etc., that is, in a dry space, which makes the question of filming in general more difficult, well in more open planes, sometimes in close-ups and sometimes in counter-plongée - when the camera is below eye level, facing upwards. The audience is not treated here only as external observers of your story, but as a character within the screen. Technically, 'Birdman' is a visual spectacle, but it depends a lot on the fusion of what is seen on the screen and the public's prior knowledge of its main actors, especially Michael Keaton, once the star of the time for having starred in two films of the Batman. This is essential for the operation of the film. Without metalanguage there would be no Birdman.Michael Keaton plays the role of his career here. The actor decides to play with his persona, building a believable man in a fantastic world. It was not enough for him to prove to everyone that he can still star in a successful production, his personal life is going from bad to worse. Riggan is explored carefully in layers - from the insecure director to the proud actor - bringing in the man who was once Bruce Wayne, three different personalities. The first of these is the man himself, an ordinary person who struggles to make his life work, trying to make his play work while he has to deal with his daughter, Sam (Emma Stone in her best performance so far), who, in turn, , has a certain involvement with drugs. The second stage is in the already mentioned performances within the performances and the genius is in the way this character dialogues with Riggan itself, reflecting, in the play, the life of the actor / director. The third, in turn, appears in the moments of loneliness of the character, Birdman appears as an aggressive manifestation of his self-respect, functioning as a hidden double-personality. Here Iñárritu inserts his touch of master, creating in us the doubt whether Birdman really exists or is it just a tired mind's imagination? Is Riggan really a superhero?If Keaton is featured, the same can be said of the supporting cast. Edward Norton gains a role to match his talent. Mike is a tough guy, who doesn't care about the opinions of others, and tries to steal the show every time he appears. His scenes with Emma Stone (equally great) and his clashes with Keaton are other memorable parts of the production. Highlight also for the always excellent Naomi Watts and Andrea Riseborough, who experience disappointments in the personal lives of their characters and end up supporting each other.Many other aspects are criticized by Iñarritu, who criticizes practically all aspects of the current film industry, such as the massive investment in superhero films, in the pride of the actors - perfectly exemplified by Edward Norton, who plays a cartoon version of himself - and, among many others, in film criticism itself. In the technical part we still have the soundtrack of Antonio Sanchez using only drums, which got more and more accelerated as the action unfolded and became more intensified on the scene. Emmanuel Lubezki's photography is fundamental to materialize Iñárritu's plans, working dynamically, changing the focus of attention on the characters at all times, also showing the dynamism behind the scenes of a theater and the pulsating life behind the curtains.'Birdman' deals with the protagonist's existential dilemma, about having fame and then losing it, about having to prove yourself with each new job, forcing yourself to reinvent yourself to feel relevant again. It is the eternal search for acceptance, here by the critics and the public. It is also a matter of learning to deal with your ego, especially in the artistic world. Keaton's character, who like the viewer, does not know what is true and what is theater (or cinema). Can he levitate? Can you make objects float? Is dead? These are some of the inventive and unusual actions that the actor will take throughout the story, in this mixture of fantasy and reality that the script proposes. A sensation that sometimes mixes reality and illusion, where the desired is manifested through Birdman's voice and figure, as if he were a ghost chasing his alter ego. They are one, inseparable, and the continuous appearance is nothing more than the voice of conscience questioning their actions, day after day. And, in addition, bringing an objective portrait of that world around him. 'Birdman' is not a masterpiece as cited by many, but it is an instigating, dynamic film, full of references and that makes us reflect in different ways, which is a little scarce in recent years.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Playful and enjoyable,"The drama and comedy in this movie centres around a former superhero actor who has lost most of his popularity and tries to recapture his former glory by putting on a serious Broadway play. Inspite of the millions he made in superhero films he now wants to prove he can do something which will impress the critics and not just easily pleased cinema goers. Unfortunately he's bitten off more than he can chew and as things unravel and he begins to lose control, things get more and more out of hand. Much of the movie is ambiguous regarding exactly how talented our protagonist really is, as well as the motives driving him to try and make his masterpiece. All the cast performances are very strong, Emma Stone surprised me, coming out of the dire The Amazing Spider-man 2, this movie just shows that given a good script how much an actor/actress can shine. The soundtrack is playful and fits the movie well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
A Satire About Entertainment Today,"Birdman tells the story of Riggan Thomson, a washed-up Hollywood actor best known for portraying the superhero Birdman, as he attempts to reignite his career by writing, directing, and starring in a Broadway play.The film portrays the struggles Riggan faces in different ""realms"" of the entertainment world which form an ultimate dilemma. On one hand, Riggan must deal with the fact that he is typecast as Birdman and fears he will only ever be known as Birdman. On the other hand, the Hollywood actor must deal with the world of the theater, a radically different and intimidating world that approaches acting and direction alternatively from Hollywood. Overshadowing these issues is the question, is Riggan doing this for his own acting career, or is he doing this just to be relevant in society again? The writing in this film was fantastic. I was fascinated by the psychology of Riggan Thomson's character; throughout the film, he is tormented by an inner voice that represents his alter ego, Birdman. Birdman serves as a character in itself that helps accentuate the satirical themes of the film. In a world where action films dominate the market and actors achieve fame from starring in said action/superhero films, Riggan tries to rid of his reputation as Birdman while Birdman goads him to embrace it. Riggan aspires to be a great actor, while Birdman aspires to be a famous, loved actor.Michael Keaton delivers an outstanding performance as Riggan Thomson. He perfectly embodies the inner struggle and split that Riggan deals with in the film. Keaton manages to help convey the complex and mixed emotions that Riggan feels as a washed-up actor in his subtlety; nothing ever seems overacted and blatant. I'm rather upset he didn't win the Academy Award, I believe he deserved it with such a tense and careful performance.Also worth an honorable mention is Edward Norton as Mike Shiner, the famous yet infamous theater actor who joins Riggan's production. Shiner is the foil to Thomson; he represents the theater world. He is difficult to work with and yet is a fantastic actor (In one scene, he learns his lines almost instantly, which intimidates the Hollywood-based Thomson). Ed Norton's performance brought a sense of intensity and dynamic to the film; his abrasive personality made me feel almost uncomfortable watching him as he acted in some of the more surprising scenes.This film is perhaps the best direction and camera-work I've seen in a film yet. The entire film (with a few exceptions) is made to feel like one continuous shot. What does this do? It allows the audience to experience Riggan's life and torment as if we were actually following him through the tight corridors backstage and in the wide open spaces of the stage. There are no cuts or jumps, much like our own lives. We never ""pause"" or ""cut"" to a scene in our lives, we live it continuously. I was amazed by every take's length and the level of mastery the actors displayed in rehearsing their spots. The film's perspective overall helps the audience experience what show business is like; the audience reaction, the repetition of rehearsed scenes, the feeling of embarrassment when a mistake is made, everything.At a time where the biggest money-makers in the film industry are superhero/action films, Birdman could not have come out at a more perfect time. Don't get me wrong, I love following the superhero films of our times, but ever notice that Academy Award-worthy films often don't do as well in the box office as, say Star Wars: The Force Awakens? This film points out the truth of the film industry; more people will spend money to watch high-adrenaline action than what critics may consider ""art,"" and so those worthy of recognition may forever go on unnoticed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"Beautifully shot, brilliantly acted. I just wanted more","I will admit that this film kicked my ass, I read a lot of reviews before seeing it ensuring none of them gave away the story. I'm not sure though whether what I read misguided my imagination from what I actually seen or the film was so over hyped that what I eventually ended up watching didn't live up to the expectation as predicted. I ummed and ahhhed over re-watching the film before reviewing it again but in the end have decided watching it again would be unfair and to be an honest review I should write my first thoughts. Perhaps I'll write a second review sometime in the future, for now though I'm going with my original feelings and thoughts and penning that hopefully this review will leave make way for some great discussions.Riggan Thompson sits in his dressing room mediating, he hovers about three feet off the ground legs folded and hands in a praying position. Riggan Thompson was once a great comic book turned movie hero to the film industry with a legion of fans, that was all back in the 1990's. Since leaving half way through the third and fourth films his career took a dive, these days he is a washed up almost forgotten actor so to make his way back to the hearts of his fans and create some new ones he decides he will write, direct and star in an adaption of a Raymond Carver story ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"". The play is set to debut in the St James Theatre in New York, 24 hours before the first preview screening one the main actors is injured and can't do the play. He brings in a very well-known method actor Mike Shiner who has done more than enough to empress Riggan. During his first preview screening Shiner does the unthinkable and Riggan's world suddenly comes crashing down around him, his estranged relationship with his daughter gets father apart, his best friend turns on him and to top it all off a famous and reviewer has threatened to destroy the play no matter how good it actually is. With Riggan's ""birdman"" attacking him from the inside slowly Riggan's world becomes more than he can handle but what and how will he make this all work.The first and last thing you will notice about this film is that of the amazing camera work, the entire film appears to be shot in one single take which is absolutely stunning to behold, fantastic idea by both the director Alejandro González Iñárritu (21 Grams, Babel) and his lead cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, the second thing you will notice is the brilliant acting by Michael Keaton (Batman, Beetlejuice) who plays Riggan Thompson, he is amazing in his role very believable you almost think that perhaps he isn't at all acting but being himself which must be the sign of a true genius, add to the amazing acting the stunning performance by Edward Norton (American History X, Fight Club) who plays Mike Shinner, I loved his character and thought he really helped the film where it would have otherwise fallen down. I found the story though very lack luster, almost boring, I personally believe it just tried too hard to be an art-house but failed, sure it had its moments and the camera work is more than enough to class this film as amazing, as is the acting from Michael Keaton and Edward Norton, I felt it needed a lot more though to deserve all the acclaim it's so far received. Also in the cast is Zach Galifianakis as Jake, Emma Stone as Sam and Naomi Watts as Leslie.Birdman is a film that needs your full undivided attention, I personally don't believe it will be for everyone, it is a very intellectual film (perhaps that's why I didn't enjoy it as much as everyone else) It's a film that will take you deep inside a man's mind and what makes him tick, it's a film that will wish for that little bit more and lastly I believe it's a film that lies to you especially if you have seen the trailer so don't expect no big budget action film as the trailer leads you to believe.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

This couldn't get more meta!,"A movie about theatres and their theatrics, this couldn't get any more meta than this.Birdman is a movie that is not only brilliantly put together and guided by a credible vision, but it is also delineated as a character study of an aged celeb, a lost, delusional artist who is attempting to reclaim his long lost stardom and relevance and now intends to reassert his place on the front page of the editorials whilst fighting the urges of his own demons.From start to finish, this was an exhilarating, metaphor-laden trip bolstered by spectacular performances from all sections of the ensemble. Not to mention the single-take perspective that tends to foster a gratifying, life-like experience.My only criticism is the underutilised dynamic of the estranged father-daughter pairing, which could have played a more pivotal role if only they had granted this relation more time to grow and develop.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

Riggan is a tormented man who fights with his internal demons. An impressive cast with Edward Norton, Zach Galinfianakis and Amy Ryan to name a few.

"Original concept, well made, too frenetic and lacking composure","It's commendable that Hollywood should use theatrical timing to make films, because recent titles are often feel like pop videos.Woody Allen is a master at that, refusing his actors screen time shorter than 2 minutes in order to express a complex feeling. Modern films do that in a couple of seconds, and become emotionally junk.I don't like woody Allen but i think that his direction of the camera, the scene and the tempo of the acting is superior that what this awesome cast achieved.It's a film which was written for the ex batman star, and attracted a lot of good actors due to it's theatrical basis, but it failed to capture my interest.The frenetic pace was contrived, speaking was too fast, the scenes weren't elaborate, perhaps to put the viewer in the shoes of a person in situ, the camera explores the scene like someone walking around.The greatest test of composure is calm moments of intensity, and a charged silence which raises many question in between words... The lack of silence was the problem for the film. no scenic metaphors interrupted the constant hurried speaking, there was no space for reverie, although it could be a very enjoyable film after a drink and a rowdy night out, in the Cinema.I'd rate Bullets Over Broadway (1994) as being superior, perhaps just to the beauty of it's setting, it calm composure, compared to the chaos and drab backgrounds of this film and it's endless frenzy. The lack of contrast in color also with the backgrounds helped to make the frantic pace tedious, where a larger and less mundane backdrop may have lifted the unnatural uniterrupted fast chatter of the film in order to make the it more watchable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
A Tragic Comedy,"Expecting a few cheap laugh on a dull evening a brilliant plot unfolded before me while watching Birdman. For years past the notion of a tragic comedy was a commonplace but its definition ambiguous until Birdman. Rarely a film's ending that becomes apparent half way through makes me cheer for the protagonist to not execute the his ultimate actions. If I was capable of crying I would have shed a tear at its ending, making me jubilant of the direction the ending eventually takes.To understand Birdman you must realize that once millions of people adore you as a fictional superstar you start believing the hype. Just as an idea becomes an ideology once millions embrace so does a super-ego of film star begin to manifest itself into reality. The brilliance of the film is its far reach from the common but still, its ability to capture the lust of our inner world in conflict with reality.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

"Wholly original and well played, with universal themes (if not universal appeal)","Ambitious, messy, confusing, over-the-top; there is merit in all of these criticisms, if you look at Birdman from the bottom up. Several issues loom, in that respect. For example, for an overly long two hours, viewers are forced to run through the claustrophobia-inducing hallways of a theater as a troupe of actors prepares to put on a play, despite infighting and other setbacks. Outside, the cinematography flows seamlessly, with brilliant effects, thanks to Emmanual Lubezki, but seemingly separate from a consistent story line. The actors and casting were spot on, if few characters are inherently likable (Ed Norton as antagonist Mike is as stereotypically self- absorbed as you'd expect any heralded celebrity to be, for example). Setting is fully familiar, with Broadway memorably represented, but related scenes, like protagonist Riggan (Michael Keaton) being forced to run through crowds in his underwear to make his stage scene on time, seem tacked on to add needed humor to a story about a man on the edge.But what happens if you consider the plot from top down? What if, like a soaring Birdman, the Superhero that Riggan once so successfully and lucratively played on film, you could see Riggan's world all at once? Here's the essence of the story. A man who spent years being self deluded as to his own importance and place in the world attempting re-entry in his last viable years as a respectable stage actor. is going through a life transition to determine exactly what his final legacy will be. He desperately must reinvent himself for his daughter, Sam (waif-like Emma Stone), his ex-wife, his current girlfriend, and a harshly judgemental theater critic. It's his last gasp. He looks in the mirror repeatedly after removing all manner of wigs and disguises, only to see an aging face and vanishing capabilities. At the same time, his still-vibrant imagination convinces him that he can move objects, even hurl furniture at the walls, through sheer force of will. Decades ago, an obscure salesman named Willy Loman faced a similar challenge. In Miller's play, he clings to memories of long-ago but now irrelevant successes in order to believe, and convince others, that he still matters. Audiences rooted for Loman in all of his ego-blindedness and flaws, knowing he was, after all, Every Man. When do we say it's over? Wouldn't we really rather, as Riggan says passionately to his hostile critic, ""kill ourselves"" so that the play can go on? And so we can re-invent ourselves, before all the minutes run out?This is the theme that pulls Birdman together in the end. Keaton, who was woefully under-appreciated in a number of roles--Clean and Sober is just one of many examples-- nails the essence of what director Inarritu has set out to do, above and beyond the flaws that sometimes occur when a talented director is overly ambitious. Sit back--be patient--look for the big picture--and look for solid mentions (in acting, cinematography) at Oscar time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"What does a former James Bond, Bruce Wayne or Peter Parker do when a younger, stronger actor takes his place on the screen?","Birdman brings a whole new ""magic to the movies"" that I haven't felt in a very long time. CGI and other amazing talented movie makers have given us the middle earth (Lord of the Rings) and realistic twin brothers (The Social Network). It's not a bad thing at all -- we are living in such an amazing time for movies and TV shows. That said, rarely do I walk away from a movie completely in awe of how it was made.Enter Birdman. While there is some CGI to it, it's the camera-work that is truly outstanding. It's like watching a play in front of your eyes, the camera never breaks as it walks you though the story. No second shots. No fades to black. It's as if the actors and crew had a one-day shoot with quick costume changes and breaks between the scenes. Please spend your hard earned money supporting this movie at your local theater -- even if it's just to appreciate and support the talented folks behind the cameras that made this movie.Now for the folks on screen -- amazing. Michael Keaton, Emma Stone, Naomi Watts and Ed Norton. I have a personal motto when it comes to movies ... ""If Ed Norton is in, I'm in"". Of course he wouldn't let me down. Yet again he comes to the screen with some of the best acting I've seen. After watching Naomi Watts play a Russian stripper in St. Vincent, it was awesome to see her in a completely different role a Broadway actress struggling with confidence on and off the stage. Emma Stone was brilliant. Not only would she be a great friend to have ... she is proving herself as not just a pretty face but a talented actress who I see getting a golden statue someday.And Michael Keaton -- we've missed you. What a wonderful comeback story to bring to us. His real-life comparison playing Batman over 20 years ago made this movie eerily creepy in a touching way. But Keaton was not only great because he once himself a Birdman, he was great because he is a great. A few times I did hear a bit of Beetlejuice in his rants, which brought back more fond Keaton-memories.I felt a lot of vulnerability from Keaton. It seemed personal. And there is nothing better than genuineness on and off screen. Keaton, Stone, Norton - they gave it their all.You may love this movie, you may not. It is a true independent film -- if you're favorite movies are Hollywood blockbusters this is not going to be on top of the list. However I still encourage you to see this movie. It's an interesting story about life after big Hollywood (think modern-day Sunset Blvd.). What does a former James Bond, Bruce Wayne or Peter Parker do when a younger, stronger actor takes his place on the screen? After watching Birdman, you may even have a bit more respect for our childhood superheroes and their courage after the sets are closed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
As good as it gets...,"I've thought about this film every day since i saw it last week. I don't see anything unless I've read enough to figure it is going to be worth my ticket price. So, I was pretty sure it was going to be good. It knocked me for a loop. Technically it is fantastic. The editor will win the Oscar, I'm betting. Many scenes appear to be one long take of five or ten minutes in a run. the edits but they are hidden, disguised and sublime. This gives the movie an energy that just pulsates.the trailers and TV spots show us some super-hero stuff, explosions and such, but those elements take up maybe fifteen seconds of the movie itself and are used only for very specific emphasis (Keaton is imagining them)every performance is award-caliber....not a stumble, not a miss. Keaton is stupendous. Norton is huge. Galifianakis can ACT. Emma Stone, exceptionally fine. Naomi Watts: best performance of her life. Andrea, Amy, Lindsay all at the very top of their game! even the background characters who appear on screen for a few seconds are perfect. like the stage-hand to gives Keaton a smoke and a light..he's just the right guy to do it.this one is amazing and satisfying in every respect. i'd love to have Ebert with us to tell us what he thinks.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
This is Theater - Birdman,"Birdman is a combination of Day For Night and Shakespeare in Love in the sense that it is a play within a play (or a movie within a movie, if you prefer). It is sometimes hard to separate the reality from the fantasy. And that is waht makes it such fascinating viewing. The play, of course, is mediocre, at best, and the acting is over the top by design, but the concept for this film is brilliant, and the writing and directing are impeccable. The special effects are kind of neat as well. I did sympathize, however, with the brutal review of the Times critic in the film, that most Hollywood actors are celebrities, and not really artists. That label, of course, does not hold true for Keaton in this film, nor does it hold true for the absolutely perfect Ed Norton performance (how does he reach such perfection in EVERY role he does?). I have been a critic for several years, and I can vouch for the fact that nothing will eat you up alive more than live theatre. The life of an actor is tough at times, but the life of an actor or actress in theatre is very tough on the body. What a great film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Rip Off Of Day For Night,"This is a really well-executed rip off of a movie very few people have watched. Or had and forgotten. Surprised no one has brought this up before, but it has identical themes with identical characters and identical moments. The one thing we can say, is that it is an indictment on the life of Michael Douglas (Keaton) the same way it was about the indictment of Francois Truffaut.I think it's a great steal though. And done well. It really put Keaton into the driver seat of both being an apologist for his career and executioner of the fan base that followed him through his Gotham days. IF his life interests you and his opinion of nerds who fell into the hole of Warner Bros. product, this movie will fascinate you. For the rest who care very little about a has-been superstar self-imploded spoiled actor, this will irritate you.I liked it for the insight to how people like Keaton feel about us. And critics. Does it effect him...what the public says...yes. Does it guide his life...no. He's perfectly content on the lackluster career he's had since the cape crusader. Has he spent a lifetime proving to you that he isn't that guy anymore? I think so. I never thought he was that guy anyway. But...I find it odd that someone who turns to be beloved such as Jack Nicholson hurdled this stardom but someone who is in his head so much, like Keaton got buried under it. This movie may give you a glimpse on his own psyche.It's not enjoyable, but has moments. And moments are enough.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"Talk about ""sound and fury, signifying nothing"" ....","I won't add a blow-by-blow criticism of this film, as plenty of other reviewers have already provided those. My overall impression was summed up by one scene, where Michael Keaton's character goes to buy booze and we hear someone yelling lines from Macbeth's most famous soliloquy (""To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow ... full of sound and fury, signifying nothing""). Like that moment, _Birdman_ consists largely of hyperdramatic dialogue, delivered caustically, and without an obviously redeeming purpose.That doesn't mean I'm blaming the actors; I think they work at a high level in fulfilling the director's vision. Unfortunately, that vision is almost relentlessly tawdry, depressing, and lacking in basic human warmth or decency.This is probably some sort of paean to the nihilism of the acting world. Not being inside that world, all I saw and heard was an ugly, noisy mess, full of obscenities, lies, and bad behavior. It may be wonderfully self-referential if you're an actor or director or producer, but in my world, it just isn't entertaining.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Amazing. A masterpiece. Ignore the negative reviews.,"This film is brilliant. Don't let the negative reviews fool you. I can only imagine the people complaining about a lack of plot could only understand a terrible Adam Sandler film. Michael Keaton is fantastic as the troubled former Hollywood superstar trying to be a success on Broadway. All the performances are great but Edward Norton is the other stand out, playing a stereotypical method actor. The relationship between Keaton and Norton gives us some of the funniest and most memorable scenes.However the true genius in this film is in the direction. The one continuous shot format is incredibly immersing and the drum soundtrack makes somebody walking down a corridor have a tense feel to it. I was the only person in the cinema as I watched it at the end of the run, it could have been easy for me to get bored but I was fully engaged and swept up in this masterpiece.

The acting is superb from Keaton and the rest of the cast but still wasnt that impressed with the concept or the direction that the movie took.

The adventures & misadventures of Riggan Thomson, the doomed protagonist, is at times funny & at times heartbreaking. Riggan not only must overcome his ego, but is also pitted against a rebellious, drug addicted daughter (A Fabulous Emma Stone), a notorious, egomaniac co-actor (An Incredible Edward Norton), as well as deal with his estranged wife & even a money-minded producer (Amy Ryan & Zach Galifianakis, both in top form).Iñárritu, Nicolás Giacobone, Alexander Dinelaris, Jr. & Armando Bo's Screenplay is utterly delicious, throwing in everything you might expect, be it high level emotion, crude humor & potent drama, there's everything here & its all put in significantly.

Not half as good as it wants to be,"After reading all the great reviews, I was really looking forward to seeing Birdman but I was sorely disappointed. The story doesn't develop into anything particularly interesting and I didn't care what happened to any of the vacuous, one-dimensional characters. The lesbian scene is thrown in there for no reason at all, Norton's character doesn't develop enough and we never really find out the background of the relationship between Keaton's character and his wife and daughter (I can't remember any of the character's names, that's how much I cared about them).As far as I can see, the reason for the rave reviews must be down to the unique filming technique with all the long takes which is different to anything I've seen before, (even though there is more than one occasion where somebody fluffs their lines but it was left in the final cut anyway), and the acting which, to be fair, is very good. All in all, Birdman left me feeling empty. It's self- indulgent, pretentious nonsense that doesn't deserve the 5 star reviews it's been getting. Not by a long shot.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
The cinematography is luscious with a very creative screenplay and mesmerizing musical score,"I left the theater feeling I got my moneys' worth, and as a result I have placed this film title on my ""purchase for personal library"" list. Why? Well I am not a big fan of dark comedies but the characters in this film, and more importantly the actors playing the characters were all top notch performances. I can understand why Michael Keaton would have received an Academy Award nomination for Lead Actor, and why he has already won the 2015 Golden Globe award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy.The film revolves around a depressed washed up action hero whose action hero character the Birdman made three epic multi-million blockbuster films some two decades earlier. After losing his box office drawing power Riggan Thomas (played by Michael Keaton) decides to invest his remaining bankroll and mortgage his Malibu beach home to write, direct and act in a Broadway play based on a short story written by an author named Raymond Carver. Carver had hand written a note and personally handed it to Riggan complementing him on his performance when Riggan was a young actor just starting out in the business. Riggan held on to that note for the next three decades in his wallet as a reminder that someone as famous as Raymond Carver believed in his acting abilities. So Riggan decides to muster up all his courage, talent (and especially his own money) to adapt his stage play based on Raymond Carver's short story that was written some 50 years earlier. Riggan will give his heart, soul and mind to direct and also act in his stage play.Riggan's action hero character Birdman continues to haunt and taunt Riggan's mind by telling him he is the Birdman and must rise up and fly like he has never flown before and take the worlds evil doers on as he did when he was the number one rated box office draw. Riggan realizes that his mind is playing tricks on him and so he tries to suppress these images of the Birdman when it appears in his dressing room just before he is to appear on stage.The stage is where we get to see both Michael Keaton's and Edward Norton's brilliance as ""A grade"" actors. Norton adds both humor and suspense to the film when he joins the plays cast as a late replacement for an actor that Riggan felt was just awful for his play. So Norton, who plays Mike, is considered a natural born for the stage box office draw agrees to join the cast after his live in girlfriend Lesley (played by Naomi Watts) recommends her boyfriend Mike to Riggan.The business of operating the play is managed by a lawyer named Jake (played superbly by Zach Galifianakis). Jake also adds some of the the comedy relief to the depressing character of Michal Keaton's Riggan/Birdman. Jake is Riggan's oldest and dearest best friend and moral compass to keep the stage play financially afloat but Riggan's mind continues to waver as Birdman's character continues to make his presence felt in Riggan's mind and he continues to explode and make some bad decisions with both his finances and his career.Adding to his personal turmoil is his ex-wife Sylvia (played by Amy Ryan) and his daughter Sam (played by Emma Stone) fresh out of re- hab who are both hovering around the stage and adding to his guilt of not being a faithful husband or present father.So we the audience get to see if Riggan can survive his own stage play, his family guilt, his girlfriend, his new and brilliant co-star Mike, a New York stage critic with a nasty pen that has buried many a Broadway plays on their opening night, and of course can Riggan survive Birdman? I did enjoy this 2 hour dark dramedy more than I thought I would mainly due to the strong acting by this cast of stars and I will give credit to the director Alejandro González Iñárritu for maintaining a strong story line and captivating his audience. Mrs. Shullivan came out of the theatre stating ""well that was different but I did enjoy Michael Keaton and Edward Norton's performances"". It will be added as a keeper to my collection. Well done. I give the film an 8 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
The technical ambitions pay off for Iñarritu and Lubezki,"""You're doing this because you're scared to death, like the rest of us, that you don't matter. And you know what? You're right. You don't. It's not important. You're not important. Get used to it.""No matter how people feel about this film, there is no denying that Birdman is a technical marvel. Emmanuel Lubezki is one of the best cinematographers in Hollywood and he should continue working and experimenting with his fellow Mexican directors. Birdman is visually astonishing and one of the most unforgettable movie-going experiences of the year. He blew us away last year when he took us to space in Gravity, and now he astonishes audiences once again by giving us the illusion that the film is taking place entirely in one single shot. From the opening shot, Lubezki is letting us know that we are going to get our heads spun and so he circles around a table with four actors discussing their roles in the play they are about to act in. Birdman is unlike any other film I've seen in that sense, where you feel like you are watching actors in a live theater. The audience becomes the camera which follows around these egocentric and troubled actors as they interact with one another. The film has stuck with me and it is one of those rare movies I'd like to experience once again in the theaters. I can't think of another film that manages to portray the passage of time so well without having to cut from one scene to the next the way Birdman does.Alejandro Gonzalez Iñarritu is better known for his realistic and depressive films focusing on separate characters whose lives intertwine someway or another (Amores Perros, 21 Grams, Babel). This was quite a fantastic change of tone from his previous and more depressing films. He has crafted one of the best films of the year with groundbreaking editing effects that magically make us believe the film is all a continuous shot. He also uses dark and satirical humor to critique egocentric Hollywood actors, critics, artists, and even audiences who eat up anything they are served as long as there are loud explosions and non-stop action scenes. Iñarritu takes a shot at just about everyone. Alexander Dinelaris's script was wickedly smart and satirical with some great and memorable dialogues that complement the technical achievements of the film very well. Birdman has a lot to say about our human nature and our desperation to become relevant and important. It is a complete film that deserves all the recognition and awards it has been receiving.The performances in Birdman also stand out above most films released this year. Michael Keaton is fantastic as Riggan Thomson, a once popular actor who starred in a superhero franchise but hasn't been able to do anything relevant since. He is known for the character of Birdman, but he wants to prove he is a real artist and not just a washed up celebrity. That is why he is risking everything in a play he is directing, writing, producing, and starring in. His good friend, Jake (Zach Galifianakis) is co-producing the play with him. Lesley (Naomi Watts), Laura (Andrea Riseborough), and Mike (Edward Norton) are the actors he hires for the play, while his daughter Sam (Emma Stone) is working for him as his personal assistant as she tries to recover from her former drug addictions. The supporting cast is excellent in this film, especially Edward Norton and Emma Stone who share several great scenes together along with Michael Keaton. Galifianakis also impresses in a much more serious role than what we are used to seeing him in, but this is still Keaton's film who displays a wide range of emotions. Birdman has become such an important part of his life that he actually interacts with him in a surreal way. The film balances this magical realism very well and Keaton pulls off the feat of having these inner conversations with himself. The intimate camera-work only enhances these performances even more.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Stardust memories,"Much to this films credit, it defies a quick summary. Play within play within film, modern day fable, Blockbuster buster - suffice to say it has quite a few threads hanging off it that don't really help with defining it.It is, at least, the search for relevance in the wrong place. The acting is unusually good from a variety of sources. Keaton handles his careless madness well, and all the supporting characters help to build the showtime nightmare world that Keaton's own Birdman has helped create.Because the film is effectively so self referential, I suspect reviewers will be flaying around for meaning. I will only say that this very much what Woody Allen would be doing if he wanted to reprise the ideas in Stardust Memories. Or maybe Celebrity. In fact, this effective ensemble piece picks up on many of the great directors' themes.The film is clever, but it is always entertaining. The changes of pace are not always handled with care, which may leave people with the idea that the film is too long.

One of the best movies 2014 has to offer and one of my all time personal favorites,"Birdman, to put it simply, was exhausting to watch. I don't mean this in a negative way - in fact, it's a compliment. There really aren't words potent enough to describe how masterful the directing, cinematography, and editing are. Birdman is a masterclass of technical marvels - marvels that aren't in your face screaming, ""Look at how amazing this movie is!"". Birdman is a film of subtlety; its message and themes may be hard to grasp but once you grab hold, it's nothing short of an extraordinary ride.Emmanuel Lubezki. This man is a god of modern day cinematography. Lubezki has outdone himself again after his (stunning) work on last year's ""Gravity"" (which won him an Oscar as well as dozens of other awards) and 2006's fantastically shot ""Children of Men"". Throughout the entire main story of Birdman, the camera. Never. Cuts. Or so it appears that way, thanks to ingenious strokes of editing mastery. Films have attempted long shots in the past, one of the most famous being the tracking shot from Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"". Imagine a shot done just as well, if not better, and with so many intricacies but throughout the entire film. It's jaw-dropping. It makes everything seem so real and focused, and, as a result of this, exhausting to watch. It thrusts the audience into the picture; we are living and breathing in the movie along with the characters. This is a fare feat in film making. It's been done, sure, but not in this way. Not in a way so clever and genius yet simple and subtle.Alejandro González Iñárritu brings more complexity but seemingly simplistic talent to Birdman with his excellent direction. He knows exactly what needs to be done, how it needs to be done, and when it needs to be done. It's brilliant and thoroughly entertaining.Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, and Emma Stone all give the best performances of their careers, which is especially notable for Norton given his past works. It never feels like they're are acting; they feel like real people. The performances are, once again, subtle and incredibly natural giving everything a more genuine feel. The rest of the cast is great as well but don't standout as much.Birdman is a simple movie, or it appears that way. Underneath it's a complex beast full of ideology and philosophy about life, the people we spend life with, and, most importantly, who we ourselves are. It also spends a fair amount of time analyzing what the film industry has become as well as what impact critics have on both artists and audiences. It's a fascinating study of modern society.If someone were to ask me what Birdman was about I'd tell them it's really just a simple metaphor of life itself. Its beautiful, sad, funny, and enormously rewarding. I couldn't recommend this movie enough.

He is attempting a comeback doing something artsy, not unlike Michael Keaton in Birdman. Because it's self-reflexive, it must be FABULOUS! Well, not so much. But it is usually smart and oft entertaining. Like a piece of lesser-known theater, it has its moments.There are some things that are fabulous in Birdman. First, the bits of magical realism throughout the film work quite well, until the ending. Second, there is Ed Norton chewing up the scenery with controlled, skillful over-acting. And last on the list of the fabulous is the jazz drumming that follows the actors as they wind their way through the maze of rooms: dressing, make-up, costumes, and through the stage rigging, the lights and other tools of the trade found backstage at a Broadway theater.The other acting is as good as its script allows. Emma Stone is fun as Sam, Riggan's (Birdman) daughter, but her petulance becomes irksome after awhile. We fail to see one moment of genuine emotion from the character, even when showing her concern for her father. Her father, Riggan, is played adequately by Michael Keaton, but the famous actor down-on-his- luck schtick is tiresome. Riggan takes himself so seriously that he is a bore. Somehow, I believe that was NOT the intent of the director/writer Iñárritu.Naomi Watts is adequate, but her character's lines about trying to ""make it on Broadway"" were repeated too many times for me to care. It wasn't so much her acting that annoyed me, her hackneyed and out of place dialogue. If she improvised them, well, then it was her acting.Zach Galifianakis was surprisingly not the most annoying one in the movie this time. He plays the straight man, the producer of the play, to counterbalance all the lunacy of the actors. He keeps it together and does a fine job.Iñárritu is making an artistic comeback himself as the writer and director of ""Birdman"", not receiving this much acclaim since his first feature, ""Amores Perros"", a much more compelling drama. ""Birdman"" is interesting and clever with all its metaphor and fantasy. The problem is that Iñárritu could not get away from magical realism long enough to make a coherent ending. And as we all know, a terrible ending can turn a good film into a mediocre film. That, unfortunately, is what happens to ""Birdman."" It's treatment is so unusual, but its theme of a washout actor making a comeback so worn out, that a cogent ending was needed to make it work.The camera work and editing are excellent, as are the sets. The script is at times brilliant and at other moments, mundane. Another run-through by actors and other writers may have brought some needed realism to the magic on the screen. As far as New York goes, the city plays its part well, as always.Rating: MatinéeIt's fair, but for a better, harder hitting film featuring a washed-out actor, rent ""Sunset Boulevard.""Peace, Tex Shelters",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Birdman (or One of the Best Movies of 2014),"What can I say about this film... excellent would be an understatement. Having just left the theater, I am pained by the thought that more people have not and may never see Birdman. Birdman sounds cliché, the title is something we've all heard before. Superhero, superhero, superhero. This movie is not that.Instead, Birdman offers a true look in to the mind of a man who has, in theory, disappeared. He has no social media, barely any family, and about as much relevance as... well, a guy who played in superhero movies years ago. But what shifts Birdman from every other movie is the true glimpse you get inside of all the characters heads. Never once do you feel like the actors are trying to hard, you forget they're acting. You forget you're in a movie.Birdman constantly walks on the lines of reality and fantasy. And at the end, you are left to decide what is real or not.I recommend this film to anyone who truly enjoys movies, I mean real, authentic, just all around good movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Blown away by Birdman,I've seen many reviews here saying this is a boring film but with good characters. I was so captivated by the characters I did not find it at all boring and found it constantly engaging both through what was happening to the characters and through being able to really feel you were there among the action the action due to the way it was shot. It takes a few minutes to adjust to the continuous steady-cam but once used to it it becomes a more rewarding experience as it seems more real. I wouldn't be surprised if other films follow in this style of shooting. Having said that I believe I would have enjoyed the film even if it wasn't shot this way.,10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Simply the best!,"I had to create an account to review this movie and dis-spell some the critiques of this movie. Like the 'Artsy' quality being there as some pretentious 'fuck you'. There are layers to every art form and I can say this transcends a lot and does it well. The chaotic nature of the tone is an intended purpose, the dialogue is carefully crafted and flows with an almost poetic quality. I simply do not get these reviews berating this great movie, I get the twelve year old expecting some wafer thin action/comedy flick about a superhero. The satire of this film isn't only surface deep, it goes as far to criticize the very life of the actors playing their respective roles. As Keaton who played Batman and Norton who is notoriously difficult on set. The shots were complex and masterfully cut. The score set the tone of Riggan's mind, which co-incidentally is also a satire of the method to madness many actors employ on set, mirroring the issues many actors carry with them and ironically carry them to greatness and down again.There isn't some great conspiracy by Hollywood where pretentious movie critics flock around this movie to SEEM intellectual, however it does seem you need an intellect capable of seeing past a surface to actually enjoying this, so in that aspect a lot of the audience seems to have this movie fly right over their heads. There is a reason this has gotten critical acclaim in the press, and is a shoe in for an Oscar, not to mention it's two Golden Globes. It's not that they're ALL pretending to like a movie to seem smarter, it might be you're just not clever enough to enjoy it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Best film of 2014,"Birdman's plot synopsis, an ageing film star who once was successful in a comic book movie franchise launches a Broadway show in a desperate bid to reclaim his glory and save himself, makes it sound insignificant and dull. It's anything but. It satirizes, critiques and comments on so many things; family, the media, blockbusters, film criticism, egos, fame, celebrity culture and showbiz in general. It's filmed to look like one continuous take and has an amazing ensemble cast. In general, Birdman is the greatest film of the year (Sorry Boyhood) and a masterpiece so captivating I was lying stunned and open mouthed in my seat for the whole thing. There are very few issues, aside from the fact some may find it a bit weird, and this amazing superhero movie which isn't a superhero movie is a devastating, deliriously entertaining knockout blow which has more strength than all the heroes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe combined. Instead of cartoony villains, boring love stories, explosions and general idiocy this is a reminder of how great films can be, and a reminder of why all these actors are successful.Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, Emma Stone and even Zach Galifianakis are all exceptional in their roles, and Michael Keaton makes a remarkable comeback. It's amazingly well directed, and the single shot cinematography works remarkably well. The script is not only deep and clever, it's also darkly comic and bursting with raw energy. This is a darkly funny movie. It's a emotionally powerful movie. It's a thrilling and relentlessly fascinating movie. It's a hypnotic and enigmatic movie. It really has it all. This is probably too different to win best picture, but it should certainly be nominated for it. In general, this is a remarkable achievement for everyone involved and a nice break from the formulaic Marvel movies that seem to come out at least twice every year. It will speak to and entertain many people, and there's so much depth and ingenuity in this movie that I cannot wait to see it again on DVD. A must see for everyone. To be honest, a review and description doesn't really do this highly unusual and bold film justice. Just see it.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

Great cast and cinematography for a subpar script,"Needless to say, ""Birdman"" is an elegant film blessed by undeniable visual artistry and superb cast performances. However, it somehow falls short of its own ambitions due to its snobbish attitude and half-baked script. The illusion of watching one continuous shot for two hours straight is impressive indeed, and despite the leaps in time and space, the transitions are all handled elegantly. Other than that, it's yet one more self-referential film about the relationship between character and man, stage and life, theater and cinema, fame and genius, art and entertainment, and so on. The first half is actually pretty convincing, as it takes it time to introduce different artists who are all linked by their desperate seek for love and approval, as well as their tendency to sabotage their own happiness. Too bad that all these characters just appear and disappear without adding anything to the film, their portraits left incomplete and their purposes unknown. The only one to get full exposure is obviously Michael Keaton's, but he just keeps repeating himself with no character development or change of perspective whatsoever. There are fun dialogues and interesting scenes along the way, but the film as a whole felt like it could have been organized better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

There's a lot of meat on those bones!,"I love walking into a movie not really knowing much about it. Sometimes what you read jades you, it's only human. I will try to jade you properly. This movie is brilliant on many levels and it's not loud, it's not CG crazy or shot on green screen. You won't see a lot of flashes and explosions or fast paced editing. There is no 80s hair band post score. What it does have some fascinating humans that are roped together by this Broadway play and reality.To US movie goers Michael Keaton is a face we've known for a long time. I felt old when his first closeup comes, I thought to myself, Batman was made in 1989. But Keaton aged in good way. His character, Riggan is the once celebrated box-office action hero, Birdman. The film does a beautiful job analyzing his conflict between art, his stage debut and the prospect of doing Birdman 4. I love the technique Alejandro González Iñárritu chose for this first person style narrative. And that's all I'm saying about that.This movie is not for everyone, but if you happen to be in the production business, you will see it and you'll learn something you didn't know. To me, that's the bonus but to the art film buff Birdman is the next great superhero!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"A complex and brilliant intellectual machine of a film, a soaring accomplishment","Washed up celebrities, surrealism, truth and the theatre converge into an extraordinary film from Alejandro González Iñárritu (""Amores Perros,"" ""21 Grams""), a master of weaving multiple story lines together tackling dark but powerful themes about human nature and love. ""Birdman"" does not veer from these themes, but it is a dramatic structural shift for Iñárritu; rather than disparate subplots or vignettes, the film is intended to look like one continuous take.Michael Keaton aptly stars as a celebrity whose heyday ended in the '90s – Riggan Thomson, a.k.a. Birdman. Riggan is about to enter previews with his Broadway debut, an adaptation of Raymond Carver's ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love,"" which he wrote, directed and stars in, yet he's haunted by Birdman, a voice in his head that provokes him and tells him he's above it all. But Riggan has everything tied up in this production: a ton of money, his pride, his self-worth as an artist (not a celebrity) and even his personal life. His daughter, Sam (Emma Stone), is fresh out of rehab and working as his assistant, and he's dating his co-star (Andrea Riseborough).It all hits the fan, however, when one of the play's male leads suffers an accident and in walks Mike Shiner (Edward Norton). A Broadway star, Mike's views on theatre and acting put him at creative odds with Regan. He also creates more backstage drama because his girlfriend is the play's fourth star (Naomi Watts) and he also strikes up a connection with Sam. Thus begins a series of tumultuous events as opening night nears, where everything could unravel with one bad review from The New York Times.Iñárritu gleefully plays with reality, keeping the audience constantly guessing as to what's real. This isn't just limited to what's going on in Riggan's head and whether or not he has telekinetic powers; the script floats in and out of its own dialogue and the play's dialogue, blurring the lines between the two, especially because the play, of course, echoes the themes of the film. Iñárritu does a masterful job keeping us from ever quite establishing what's ""real"" in the movie, a tactic the serves to heighten our attention to detail while watching everything unfold.And my, what details indeed. An entire review could be written about the film's continuous takes, or about the rhythm and timing of all the shots and scenes accentuated brilliantly by a score performed on a single drum set. ""Birdman"" feels like its own organism, with Iñárritu, composer Antonio Sanchez, cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and editors Douglas Crise and Stephen Mirrione working in perfect harmony. It's kind of amazing that their work doesn't distract from the story's complexities, let alone bolster them.The actors are far from pawns in this intricate machine of a film, however. Keaton rises above simply being cast for the obvious ways his career mirrors Riggan's and meets the demands of this role in a way with surprising aplomb. Although he'll go down in the history books as Batman and Beetlejuice, this is the crowning achievement of his acting career. Norton, Watts, Stone and even Zach Galifianakis as his manager/assistant are a pretty extraordinary ensemble of supporting cast members helping him to succeed.The themes, ideas and commentary about art and celebrity make ""Birdman"" a total critics' film and one with an endless pile of conversation-starters. Each relationship between characters, Riggan's relationship with himself and with Birdman brings its own ideas to the overall film, plus there's the notion about truth in art, being an artist versus a celebrity, the relevance of social media in our lives as it relates to these things and more. Add in how the technical aspects of the film complicate these themes and ""Birdman"" is a total intellectual triumph. It's also darkly comical, dramatic and bizarre, so the entertainment factor doesn't fall by the wayside.Audiences will enjoy ""Birdman"" to the point that they can play along with Iñárritu's distortion of reality. Getting too caught up in what's real or what's actually going and not exploring the artistic messaging going on below the surface or emerging from the details will make ""Birdman"" a frustrating viewing experience. Expand your comfort zone and imagination and ""Birdman"" takes captivating, creative and majestic flight.~Steven C Thanks for reading!

Heavy man !,"Largely over rated movie, not lacking qualities, probably exceeded though. It's often funny, okay, poignant at times, absurd or even fantastic (poetic?) sometimes, but it's so heavy for a topic that deserves more lightness. This is the story of a challenge, a rebirth, a creative process for a has-been actor attempting to be recognized at last and for that matter the choice of Michael Keaton (whose Beetlejuice remains legendary to me) and the resonance with his own career is perfect. It's also a film about show business, where the strings, tricks, clichés and outbids are visible ad nauseam. As for staging theater, backdrop of the intrigue, the form of Birdman has a lot to do with its point. Except that it is abstruse. It is only a pretext for a series of burlesque scandals from each of the protagonists. Let me be clear, this is still a movie to watch: it's well done, the actors are excellent, there is rhythm and imagination in the waltz (perpetual sequence-shot) depicting these pathetic people, but everything is running round, it's heavy, insistent and in the end we do not care at all about their states of souls. In comparison, Birdman is closer to American Huslte or Synecdoche NY than Altman's or Cassavetes' movies, which I read Iñárritu's feature was compared to.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Suicide Is good?,"As we dive deep into the mind of yet another conceited self-wallowing self-absorbed psychotic main character in this years winner for best picture, I find myself dumbfounded in what is considered art in todays society. Although I did enjoy the film it rattles me to the core what is considered a great film in the eyes of people in this generation. I sense a message coming from this movie that says todays big Hollywood hits, mainly comic book superhero films, are nothing more then big flashy expensive productions that is not real art, and does not represent good creativity in the movie making industry. At times to me it bathes in its own self-righteousness all while maintaining its central theme of suicide. I swear that this movie couldn't go ten minutes without referencing suicide in some way shape or form. At some points you actually start to believe that Keaton's character will abandon his selfish desires for the betterment of his families needs, but in the end chooses to end his own life in an attempt to show everyone that he is in fact ""somebody"" and not just a washed up Superhero actor. It even tries to convince us that in this act he is taking some sort of admirable approach to his dying career. Going out with a bang fashion. It upsets me that they mock films that inspire us to do good, and try to show us morals even when we doubt ourselves. Films that teach us real courage and sacrifice for the better of mankind, such as the Dark Knight trilogy, are considered less creative, and not deemed real art while films that teach us to ignore loved ones for selfish desires, and that suicide is a reasonable and honorable approach to failure are widely and critically acclaimed. My opinion of what true art is seeing something that you did not think was possible coming to life in front of your eyes. I get that from films such as the Avengers or Man of Steel. Those movies are the reason I go to the theater, to see something spectacular come to life that I have never seen before. This movie is nothing more to me then a carbon copy of all other films that show us the inside of a mentally unstable characters mind, and we get to witness his depressing fall into madness only to try to shock us and disgust us with what actions this madness makes them do. Making people try to guess what atrocious horrible action this character is going to next approach to film making is not art to me. It is my hope that great films like the ones Marvel studios puts out, and hopefully DC soon, will get the same recognition and awards that these films about crazy people doing crazy things do. Unfortunately I don't see this happening anytime soon. It was a good movie, but deserving Best Picture of the year I do not agree at all.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
A psychological journey into your own identity.,"This film runs deep into the psyche of the artist. It's the sum of itself and won't leave the cinema in your head but in your heart. The narrative never asks the audience any questions, it simply presents you with a possible truth and through the nature of the medium the audience superimposes this truth onto themselves and then assesses the result; and that is power. A straightforward narrative in the broad sense, there are few surprises in the plot and the 'big wow' moment is setup in a fairly blatant manor early on. I was a little disappointed by this setup. The presentation of the content had me off balance for most of the film, like I said it made me ask a lot of questions of myself and if the 'big wow' was more of a surprise it might just have led to a profound personal experience. The acting and potential for acting is phenomenal. This script is one of those rare treasures where it's pretty good on the page but give it to a talented cast that can connect with what lies beyond the lines and you have an incredible film. The performance gives it power. Making the audience believe that they are somehow looking in on the truth of what happens in the lives of these people (like films rarely do) becomes super-realistic as people are rarely that honest with each other in their own lives. The characters are rich and vibrant with challenging character flaws and strengths that are complex and informative of the characters. You get to see them when they are lying to each other, then you get to see they turn around and share an honest reaction with themselves. The supernatural element that is and isn't important, which is or isn't a delusion, and that is or isn't real, flows easily into the film. It makes you obviously aware of the film and the medium while keeping you focused on yourself, I mean the character; what better way to get people to question themselves? Never allow full immersion but being so truthful that you can't help but allow it into your mind. Cinematographically the film keeps the unity with extended shots, lapsing time and blending scenes into one another without overtly cutting in the edit. This makes the audience feel more present, more like a peeping tom, more like an invader in this other person's life that makes you uncomfortable, conscious and questioning. The lighting is immaculately done though the flares got a bit much. Costuming and props were spot on, the presence of the wig and the magic of backstage in a theater during a performance, all contributed to the most subconsciously conscious film I've watched in a very long while - consuming more mainstream pop culture than festival films might mean that's a deficit on my part. I'll end off with the dialog that made me cringe and smile. It's a quote from French Novelist Gustave Flaubert and reads; ""One becomes a critic when one cannot be an artist, just as a man becomes a(n informant) (original - stool pigeon) when he cannot be a soldier"" (October 22, 1846). There, in questioning identity, is the power of ""Birdman"" (Iñárritu 2014).",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
A curious insight into acting and vanity,"'Birdman' is an interesting film, but also a movie about a Broadway play - not the most invigorating subject. The concept of a former Comic Book Movie Star trying to re-start his acting career on Broadway is certainly unique, and the film has a great look - especially the way it's filmed to look almost as if it's one continuous shot. There's a few laughs, but this is definitely not a comedy.Keaton (Riggan) is great and ably supported by Stone (Sam, his daughter), Norton (Mike - happy to get around in underpants or his birthday suit for most of his scenes) & Watts (Lesley, his co-stars), although Galifianakis is a little wasted. Even though the cinematography is good, the fact it's basically one shot means there's a fair bit of wasted time as we follow characters down hallways. Probably could've been a 100min film, rather than two hours. The other thing I found annoying was the drum/cymbal fills - they're in his mind, but are very distracting.It's essentially about ego and the driving force behind actors. Sure, Riggan is a more delusional character than most actors (hopefully!), driven by his insecurity. As the critic says to him: ""you're not an actor - you're a celebrity"". Burn. The ending is, like the whole film, different, but not completely satisfying.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Birdman Soars,"Birdman (or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) has already received a flock of critical acclaim. With an impressive 93% on Rotten Tomatoes and a more than respectable 89 from Metacritic, it should be clear to readers that there is plenty to love about this movie. What will one more positive review going to do? Hopefully, it convinces readers to see one of 2014's finest films and one of the best of the 2010's (a decade that Birdman has a quite a few things to say about.) Director Alejandro González Iñárritu hatches a living, breathing masterwork that feels like nothing else I have experienced at the movies.The story, although difficult to categorize, lands in the precariously placed nest of 'meta-film' – but in that case – it could just as easily land in the 'meta-theater' category. Obscure as those genres may be, Iñárritu's fifth feature throws in enough comedic banter, existential crises, spot-on satire, taught drama, and surreal suspense to mystify any film scholar attempting to successfully pigeonhole Birdman. Think back to the year's most critically successful film (Boyhood) and the year's most lucrative (Guardians of the Galaxy); while each of these films boast some substantial cinematic creativity, neither of them come close to the unclassifiable postmodern genre goulash that is Birdman. Iñárritu and his three co-writers (Nicolás Giacobone, Alexander Dinelaris & Armando Bo) have crafted a screenplay with a 'meta' feel that does not get off by winking at the audience the entire time.In addition to its tantalizing cavalcade of genres, Birdman filters its action through an effective art-imitates-life lens aided largely by Michael Keaton's presence. As many critics have observed, Keaton's casting is perfect for the role of Riggan Thomson. Keaton, who played Batman in the two Tim Burton adaptations twenty years ago, has seen his career become somewhat deflated (although not entirely extinct) since donning the guise of the caped crusader. Similarly, Riggan, a Hollywood veteran who played Birdman twenty years ago, finds that his post-superhero acting career is in relatively dire straits. Introspective, insecure, and occasionally insane, the viewer encounters a Riggan who appears to have pulled it together just enough to stage a massive comeback by way of his Broadway adaptation of Raymond Carver's ""What We Talk about When We Talk about Love."" The film chronicles the backstage friction leading up to the play's previews and, of course, the premiere itself.Within the first five minutes of the film, a myriad of problems arise that can potentially prevent Riggan's play from taking flight. As if Riggan's own perilous ego as the director, writer, and star of the play wasn't enough to worry about, the production must replace an originally slated actor with Mike Shiner (Edward Norton), a world class actor with world class pretensions. When Riggan isn't fighting with Mike over professional ideals, Riggan's alleged best friend and lawyer Jake (Zach Galifianakis) plagues him with reminders about the production's financial instability and impending lawsuit. This all goes without bringing up Riggan's tumultuous relationship with his daughter Sam (Emma Stone), a recovering druggie who Riggan has hired to be his assistant. Oh, and did I forget to mention the voice in Riggan's head incessantly bringing up his past failures?With all of these factors in play, Birdman offers some of the year's richest characters and most original scenarios. Thanks to terrific writing and an all-around stellar cast, what could have been an ambitious mess becomes an ambitious masterpiece in Iñárritu's masterful hands. Keaton, Norton, and Stone deliver performances deserving of award recognition come Oscar time, but the acting is just one of the movie's exceptional assets. Despite being set primarily in a theater, the film's cinematography is surprisingly dynamic. Emmanuel Lubezki's camera work distracts from the confines of its limited space by being constantly on the move. In fact, the film appears to be composed in one unbroken tracking shot. The unedited feel of the photography intimates the most honest recording of a theatrical performance I have ever seen captured on film, and Antonio Sanchez's omni-present jazz percussion soundtrack provides fittingly kinetic aural accompaniment to the film's frenetic visuals.Brimming with technical brilliance, Birdman also proves to be indelibly enthralling to witness, especially for stage and screen aficionados. According to Christy Lemire's review of the film, Iñárritu sent the cast a picture of Man on Wire's Philippe Petit walking along a tightrope between the World Trade Centers. The film's every aspect channels this balance between success and failure. Birdman examines and mocks; from its characters to modern culture, nothing is sacred. Thankfully, its critiques dodge didacticism and are never anything less than constructive and thought-provoking. For every bump, twist, and turn in Birdman's roller-coaster, there is a deeper message demanding unpacking from its audience.Grade: ABy Ben Pieper (November 17th, 2014)",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Virtual virtuosity,"The stars of this movie are Director of Photography Emmanuel Lubezki, editors Stephen Mirrione and Douglas Crise, and drummer/composer Antonio Sanchez. They are the leads in Alejandro González Iñárritu's cinematic tour-de-force.The acting is, as you'd expect from this collection of actors, of the highest quality. But even these major talents (and they really don't come much more major than Lindsay Duncan, one of the great names of the British stage) didn't prevent me from taking more of an interest in how the illusion of a film made of one take was achieved. It's even beyond the achievement of Aleksandr Sokurov's Russian ARK, which really WAS in one take.The downside is that BIRDMAN is so witty, clever, self-referential, culturally aware and artistically impressive that it drowns its characters in its virtuosity. I began to wonder whether that was the director's intention, but I just couldn't believe Signor Iñárritu would be egomanic enough to play a huge joke on his cast and his audience buy spending two hours of screen time satirising egomania.

I tried to love it, but could not. Except for the good acting, the film offered me little to love. May be I was spoiled by over-expectation. Whatever the reason, I didn't have any strong impression one way or another after sitting for two hours watching the film. I didn't remember any particular scenes, nor pieces of music, nor dialogue. I just had a general feeling of boring and confusing. This film is another example ofHere are my general scoring Plot: Average, confusing sometimes, 6/10.

Giftless directing vs. great actors,"I must admit that I decided to give this movie a chance mostly due to some good actors starring in it, plus I assumed it would be kind of like a parody about the superhero genre. From the very beginning something went terribly wrong - it was the music. This pointless, annoying drumming that would not stop. I am sure this ""music"" was performed by a poorly trained monkey. Then there were those loose pieces of pointless monologue that made no sense. It must have been written by a dysphasia patient. And then I could not help but notice that the dialog was written for merely the sake of producing useless sounds. Kind of like their drumming ""music"". Even worse than anything else about this movie was lack of any mood. Whoever made this horrible waste of video recording technology was obviously on drugs and disgustingly in love with himself: ""oh, look! whatever I do always comes out awesome! and you, common people, must watch this movie standing up and applauding all the time, because if you don't, then any self-important movie critic will tell you that you don't understand art cinema!"" The old story of ""The Emperor's New Clothes"" keeps happening again and again.

Brilliant,"This film is brilliant. A wonderful idea, brilliantly realized.The actors in the film are brilliant. Keaton's performance is unbelievable, surely the best of his entire career.

Michael Keaton's Comeback,"Everybody loves a great comeback story. This was Michael Keaton's turn. Although he became recognizable in 1989 for starring in the blockbuster hit ""Batman,"" his career had faded in recent years. But ""Birdman,"" placed Keaton back in the public eye with a compelling performance that is clearly a standout in his 40-year career.Keaton plays a washed-up actor known for his role as the superhero Birdman. The parallels to Batman are meta, of course, and this is one of the great examples of life imitating art. It's also mapped out with a seemingly singular ""one-shot"", with no visible cuts for the entire film (a la ""Rope"").When it was released, the snobs claimed ""Whiplash"" was the superior independent film. They were wrong. Though Whiplash is certainly a wonderful movie, it doesn't have the epic artistic scope, story depth, or cinematic mastery of this masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Great flowing non-Super-hero movie,"The piece flows like a jazz note and floats it's plot onward, like a riverboat approaching a dam & lock. Quietly navigating through dialog that hovers above the cinematography like an increased loudness, a bass, to the treble of the thoughts within the audience.The problem was the sensitivity of the actors, especially the leads. They were working on stage, on camera, and inspired by all of the traditions of modern artistic entertainment.

"Actors are people too, you know","BIRDMAN is directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarrittu and stars Michael Keaton as a former movie superhero who takes it upon himself to direct, write and star in a Broadway play. Joining him are Zack Galifianakis, Naomi Watts, Emma Stone, and Edward Norton who play his agent, fellow cast members, and daughter. My initial thoughts when starting it weren't too great, but I gradually came to appreciate it a little more for its technical achievement and some interesting observations on the lives of actors. Still, in a film about the ego of actors and the importance of artistic expression (among other things), it came off as egotistical and self-important. Without giving away specifics or plot spoilers, I can say that the film is very ""meta."" Michael Keaton is playing a character who has some similarities, or shares some DNA, with his real-life persona, as does Edward Norton (apparently). Michael Keaton's Riggan Thompson is a former blockbuster movie star who is trying to do something artistic for personal validation, and Edward Norton's Mike Shiner is a method actor who probably takes his job a little too seriously. For me, those two characters (and their interactions) form the central dialogue and message the film is trying to get across. They also had the most interesting dynamic in the story. What I didn't necessarily warm up to was the rather cynical attitude it had towards critics and big-budget filmmaking. And some of the magical realism came off as labored attempts to be clever. Elements that did work a little more include Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography, giving the film a Malickian feel, and the drum score. Overall, I would say that I appreciated the film for what it is more than actually liking or enjoying it. It has an impeccable technical construction, but a lot of the dialogue and overt messaging felt more like therapy for actors and didn't engage me like a straightforward drama normally would. Even though this is Inarrittu's most playful film yet, it made me long for the emotional manipulation of something like 21 GRAMS. There is a time and place for different kinds of movies, and the way the film takes sides when they both feed into each other was rather disingenuous. I can understand why this film did so well at the Oscars, because Hollywood always likes patting themselves on the back, but it has mixed results as entertainment.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
A Weird and Wonderful Cinematic Masterpiece,"""I thought I knew what this movie was about. I was wrong"" A man in the row behind me said these words during the first scene of Birdman. That made two of us. I thought Birdman was about a washed up superhero movie star trying to revive his career on stage. And at least on the surface it is. But that barely scratches the surface. Birdman is one of the most complex and multi-layered films I've ever seen. There are deep glimpses inside the human mind, reflections on the nature of entertainment and art, scenes straight out of Terry Gilliam's Brazil or Walter Mitty, and all of it is hilariously funny and completely insane.Now most movie reviews start by telling you what the movie is about, but I'm afraid I can't do that. I can't tell you what this movie is about, because it is about so many things at once and because words simply cannot do this movie justice. You absolutely have to see this movie for yourself. I mean that. Whatever you're doing, get up and buy tickets to this movie right now! Sorry, I didn't mean to be pushy, it's just that I just finished watching this movie and it's really got me worked up. It's that good.Alright, that last paragraph was a little crazy. But I meant for it to be, because that will help prepare you for how crazy Birdman is, because it is utterly insane. The people in this movie are crazy. They say whatever they think, which frequently includes thoughts that would never go through a normal person head. They do whatever they feel like, no matter how inappropriate. Ed Norton's character is especially shameless on this count. He will hit on any woman, anywhere, anytime. If something bothers him, he will act out in the most outrageous ways, no matter how many people are watching. He is the ultimate Broadway prima-donna, with no self control, unlimited ego, and the unshakable conviction that he knows true art. In short an unbalanced A-hole who happens to act brilliantly.When it comes to crazy though, he's got nothing on Riggan, the former Hollywood action star turned Broadway hopeful. Riggan is on the verge of a complete nervous breakdown. And much like Bruce Wayne, he has the voice of his costumed alter ego stuck in his head, reminding him of what they had together and mocking what he's become. And he may also have telekinetic powers. The movie isn't entirely clear on that point.So this is a very unconventional role to say the least, and Michael Keaton is brilliant in it. He perfectly embodies every facet of the role: the endearing insanity, the anger and frustration, the ego and arrogance, the fear of being an old, washed up has-been. He does things in this movie that few actors of his stature would agree to do. He puts everything he has into this role, and a big part of it is that in a way he's playing himself. This is the guy who did the first two Batman movies after all. And come to think of it, the same is true of Ed Norton. His temperamental prima-donna is the embodiment of every story floating around Hollywood about how hard to work with.Add Zach Galifianakis as Riggan's frazzled lawyer Jake and the charming Emma Watson as his long-suffering daughter Sam, and the casting in this movie is perfect. So are the writing, direction, editing, and everything else about it. The screenplay blends the real and the fantastic until you can no longer tell them apart. The pacing is flawless, alternating between the serious and the outrageous so that neither becomes overwhelming. The dialog in this movie is more offbeat and maybe more realistic than Tarantino's. And the camera hovers beside the actors, matching their pace and looking over their shoulders so that you almost feel you're standing in the room with them.And oh how this movie can deconstruct. It thoroughly dismantles the realities of acting; the jealously, egos, and clashing personalities, the overlapping worlds of stage vs. screen acting, and the very act of pretending to be someone you're not. It shrewdly examines the jaded and cynical critics, the entertainment driven news cycle, the public's current obsession with the superhero genre, and our addiction to smart-phones, YouTube, and all things viral, and what it might mean for older forms of media. In a movie where a guy in a latex bird suit follows the star around there's even time to ponder the true meaning of art. This film deconstructs all of show biz in greater detail than Unforgiven did the old west.Alejandro González Iñárritu simply cannot get enough praise for what he has produced.

They are just flimsy obstacles for him to ignore. Nobody seems like a real person, the actors are all caricatures.It may seem as if Iñárritu is making fun of Hollywood/blockbusters/self-absorbedness/insecurities/vanities but with this over-long, dare I say never-ending, torture he is revealing himself as highly pretentious.Maybe I just can't relate to the subjects of this movie (self- obsessed admiration-seekers).

Stayed with me for days afterward,"I have not reviewed a movie on IMDb in several years, and wasn't even sure if my account was still active.I managed to remember my password and log in to write this review because this is the first movie I've seen in a while that had enough of an effect on me to write one. So here goes.I'll start at the end. When I left the picture-house (cinema) after watching this movie, I felt elated. Not some kind of fake high but a real sense of euphoria of being me. For the sake of being me. A feeling of pride in myself and a feeling of tremendous self-worth.Perhaps it's because the first movie I ever saw in a cinema was Michael Keaton's Batman as a 10-year old boy, and he rekindled something from deep in my past, or maybe because it was just a really f**king good movie.I mean... I was just glued, it was beautiful and just enjoyable. It had everything. Witty characters, amazing cinematography, surprises, out-loud laughs, I felt like the actors who were in this movie must have been having a blast when making it and that transpired onto the screen.

Even if your life is in crisis you can still be very happy and that's what this movie proved.It was cleverly made. The claustrophobic atmosphere of the theater and the first-person perspective moving through the corridors of the theater really made you believe you were there. On the big screen it looked amazing. Everything was so perfect it looked just...ordinary. Which was perfect. I'm not saying the movie was perfect, there's no such thing, and I'm not saying it's my favorite movie, there's no such thing either, but it's an entertaining movie that deserves your attention and theater ticket fee because God knows Hollywood doesn't make films like this very often anymore.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Acting 10 - Script 8 - Story 6,"Given this movie's underlying premise, I should say up-front that I have a love-not-love relationship with it. Yes, the acting is terrific. Given a script with substance, Michael Keaton, Ed Norton (truly amazing), and Emma Stone all received Oscar nods. I'm also big fan of Amy Ryan, who plays Keaton's wife in one of her trademark low-key performances, of the kind she perfected in The Wire. The story itself, however, of a middle-aged man's struggle to find himself amidst the debris of his messy family affairs and dwindling career is, for me, less interesting. In telling it, Mexican director Alejandro G. Iñárritu pays homage to magical realism of the South American kind (an armful of calla lilies appears on a monument somewhere to Gabriel García Márquez at every showing of this movie). What appears to be happening on the screen—Michael Keaton levitating in the lotus position or, yes, flying—can be accepted on either a literal or a metaphorical basis, or both, depending on the viewer's taste and tolerance. In the story, Keaton is a Hollywood has-been (a former superhero called Birdman) tackling Broadway for the first time, directing and starring in a production of the Raymond Carver short story, ""What we talk about when we talk about love."" The play is in rehearsal, and whether it will be successful is a toss-up. It looks unlikely. Meanwhile, Birdman himself keeps appearing like a nudgy pal, alternately flattering and browbeating Keaton and trying to lure him back into the gloriously popular action movies of his youth. The Carver story recounts an alcohol-soaked evening when two couples try to sort out what love is, a question that has baffled sober people from time immemorial. Because of his own extreme vision of love, the ex-husband of one of the characters shot himself but ""bungled it,"" says the play. Later, he died. This might be a clue to the movie's unwinding or not, because the extent to which the play-in-production is supposed to illuminate the movie is deliberately ambiguous. (I didn't understand the subtitle, either, as it seemed to me that the characters were all too knowing.) Numerous possible explanations (waking dreams, fevered thoughts, daydreams) could explain some of the action—especially the Michael Keaton character's flying—which if you're not overly hung up on trying to explain it rationally is thrilling. This is a movie that you have to decide to ""just go with it"" or face frustration. But the acting—and the bird costume!—is worth the price of admission.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

Keaton a bit bizarre as usual, and Norton in his extremely strong portrayals (it's almost getting type- cast for him though I think he's a great actor).Special effects very nicely done.

A play in disguise as a film.,"To me this film defines art. It's a phenomenon that will be remembered in cinema for years to come, and the best comeback of any actor I've ever seen by the superhero himself, Michael Keaton.A washed-up actor, (Michael Keaton) who once played an iconic superhero must overcome his ego and family trouble as he mounts a Broadway play in a bid to reclaim his past glory.Everything about this film is art. From the filming to the acting, to the tone, to the satire, this film is a superfilm. It's a play in the sense that most of the movie is a series of 30 minute continuous shots that showcase the behind the scenes of Broadway, from the actors, to Riggan's personal and business issues, etc. So much is going on, but you feel like part of the action. The film's satire is out of this world, taking on topics about the cultural genocide of our society, thinking behind an actor, a director, and even a film critic. It's the best satire I've ever seen in my life.It doesn't stop there, there's tons of superhero references from films, to clichés, etc. It's all about Keaton dealing with his ego from his superhero counterpart. The film takes several risks, hits em every time, but they're so smooth and subtle that it hits perfectly.The all star cast is irresistible, as everybody is perfectly cast. Emma Stone as Keaton's daughter who deals with drug recovery is truly supportive, Edward Norton is badass as usual, and Zach Galifianakis is hilarious as always.If this film doesn't win the Oscar for best picture, then I have no hope for humanity.

And while I mention the Oscars, I should add that Michael Keaton''s performance is absolutely stunning and probably deserves a statue too. No disrespect to the other actors, but if there's any justice, I think it should go to him due to the complexity of the character's personality. However, Hollywood has been known for liking actors whose characters are crippled, ill, and that have lost 20 kilos for the roleso we'll seein any case, back to the movie!

A classic example of what's wrong with Hollywood,"So, it was my 78th birthday, my son had come up for the occasion, and suggested we see a movie, specifically, ""Birdman"". In my youth I had a deep passion for comic books. Like the cars of the 40's and 50's, the comic book characters were individual, idiosynchratic and highly enjoyable...so what went wrong with ""Birdman""? Everything!.A talented writer creates recognizable characters, people for whom we feel sympathy or empathy. In this film, if you close your eyes, you can't tell who's speaking, and like Rhett Butler, frankly you don't give a damn.The writers seemed to believe that constant, mindless profanity would create viewer interest. Instead,all that puerile use of copulative, sodomistic language numbs the brain.I had a dental appointment the next day, and the dentist asked what I thought of the movie. My reply...""I think i just wasted two plus hours of my life."" And at my age it's a helluva loss. In summary, it puzzles me that the Academy could find any redeeming qualities in this avian misadventure.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"Uh Oh, Critic Says Birdman Isn't Perfect","Long gone are the days of Michael Keaton's Batman stardom. Hollywood has dramatically changed since then, and Keaton has found himself in a totally different position, replaced by new superstars to take up the superhero and blockbuster roles. Those days of fame and flowing paychecks have waned for not only the actor but the man who he intimately portrays in this black comedy, Riggan Thomson. Twenty years since starring in the Birdman franchise (ha, get it?), he has diminished into obscurity—hardly drawing in crowds for barely- constructed Broadway productions. That inherent feeling of self- importance is killing Riggan, the artist, inside with how far he has faded from the public eye.If there's one thing Birdman's narrative is particularly exceptional at, it's the honest and cynical look at the sheer egoism and narcissism that make up artists/actors. You always need to feel like you're the highlight of the show—the one that gets the headlines and fan girls. But when the startling truth of your irrelevance becomes realized, an ego hurt is like a soul penetrated with a keen knife. Riggan is struggling to finally make that comeback and eventually leave the world with a true legacy. He desperately wants people to admire him and to remember him as the legend his alter ego—the deep-voiced, snarky Birdman himself—and he think he is. There's no question that this is one of those films that rely more on its performances than its plot/narrative.Consequently, this is where mixed feelings materialize, but Alejandro Iñárritu's latest ambitious picture still boasts an incredible ensemble nonetheless that ranges from the greats like Naomi Watts and Edward Norton to newcomers who're still on the path to prove themselves like Zach Galifianakis and Emma Stone. Norton seemingly plays a role that also mocks his career and well-known personality. Whereas Keaton is yearning for admiration and respect here, Norton doesn't give two hoots about audience reception as he focuses more on his utter artistry and method acting ability, despite letting his bossiness and arrogance dominate the backstage production. Stone plays Riggin's daughter, Sam, who's a recovering drug addict but also frankly exasperated by her father's self-centered tendencies, constantly hanging around the theater with snide remarks.The one-take, franticly intrusive cinematography—seamlessly continuous at least in appearance—plays another essential character that complements and strengthens the already-excellent performances with a fair share of close-ups and orbital shots, traversing through majestically foggy corridors and the tragically theatrical stage to the perpetual sound of pounding drums. Thankfully, cinematographer Emmanuele Lubezski (also wildly impressing us last year with Gravity's arrant technical prowess) refrains from distracting the audience with blatant visual showiness since the fast-paced drama of stress on-screen would immediately take me back into the story whenever I'd momentarily heed the actual maneuvering of the camera.With that being said, Birdman is not perfect even though I hear the majority enthusiastically praising its genius and applauding it much like the easily-charmed audience that show up to see Riggan. A particular memorable scene in the film features a showdown between the artist (Riggan or Norton's Mike) and a New York Times critic (played effectively by Lindsay Duncan) as the two entertainingly bash each other with non-stop hurtful comments. It's clear that Birdman doesn't overtly respect the movie/theatre critic (it's unsurprising since many critics have had issues with Iñárritu's style over the years—Babel and Biutiful, for instance) as it rants with a fire about how especially entitled and unappreciative the critics are. Regardless of the wild generalizations and exaggerations made here, it keeps going and going with so much anger that the effect might either be that of irksome offense to the average critic or that of guilt.Sadly and perhaps guiltily, to vast irony, this is the point where I have to criticize this work of art (oh no!) because Birdman does indeed suffer from issues I simply couldn't ignore—problems that left me with considerable dissatisfaction, angry at the film for not allowing me to leave with the same pleasure like everyone else. First of all—as with most of Iñárritu's work—the film is so self-indulgent that I practically could see it incessantly grinning at just how clever it thinks its dialogue/screenplay is, even though everything executed and delivered quite heavy-handedly. There's no sense of subtlety and calmness to be found since the story is essentially an epic boisterous tirade. Surprisingly for such a prestigious picture, it also carries with plentiful of immature, shallow humor (""this place smells like balls""), and personally, most of the dark comedy intended didn't exactly deliver—occasionally a half-suppressed laugh to be had. The humor overall either felt underwhelming in its simplicity at times or like it was trying really hard to be witty in other moments.The ending was easily the most frustrating segment of this parade, being that it extended far beyond adequacy even though neither the narrative nor the thematic material was any more strengthened by the protracted length. Not to delve into spoilers, but the whole ordeal seemed like it was more so attempting to end on a positive/hopeful note rather than on a poignant, satirically startling shot that literally left my jaw open.Overall, when a film exists more for its themes rather than a compelling narrative, that's when I usually identify a hint of pretension within. Even despite its magnificent performances, phenomenal cinematography, and catchy score, Birdman can understandably be deemed slightly pretentious and schizophrenic (with the way it tries to shove more and more ideas and messages into its already-bloated satire while bouncing back and further between them with mumbling enunciation).",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"A mesmerizing, but bizarre film backed up by outstanding performances by Keaton and Norton","The first thing to note, for those who do not know is that the film looks as if it was done in 1 take. Big ""revelation"" aside: I came into this movie knowing just about nothing outside of what is listed above, the odd preview, and the fact that I knew I would enjoy the score. I also knew I enjoy the actors in previous films and I knew I previously didn't like the director in Babel. I came out thinking this is my favorite film of the year so far.Keaton plays Riggan, an actor who is most famous for writing, well, Birdman. He is shown to be rather psychotic, having an altered personality, shown through almost dream-like sequences with him arguing with his creation known as Birdman which results in among other things broken glass. Through him dealing with these sequences, he is trying to make a play while dealing with his self-conscious, the other actors (especially Shiner, aka Norton,) his mentor, his relationship with his daughter, and the ""insatiable"" movie critic (had to poke fun there, sorry.) Norton is outstanding as well, portraying his relationships as well as his view of his own life compared to what he can act as. He steals the show in the majority of scenes, especially in the roof-top scenes and the play scenes at the table.The other actors/actresses serve their parts outstandingly as well. The critic is as pessimistic as she should be and his daughter shows the angst and uncontrollable emotions of someone her age. The new actress shows her doubt but how she enjoys what she wants to mean to do.The film is backed up with an outstanding realized drum-solo score that keeps up with the brisk-unrelenting pace. You feel as tired as the actors but also in awe. Jokes are occasionally said but they work just to calm down the emotions of you and the characters.

"Intense, intelligent, intriguing and original","There's no denying it: 'Birdman' is pretentious, self-indulgent and very high-brow. But it's also a great movie. It's intense, intelligent, intriguing and original.It's a film about a play that's based on a short story. The characters in the film have things in common with the characters in the play. And one of them also has things in common with the real actor playing him. Michael Keaton, famous for his Batman-character, plays an actor who's famous for his Birdman-character, and this actor plays two different roles in the play based on the short story by Raymond Carver. Yes, it's complicated. And so is the film. Because I haven't mentioned yet that the Michael Keaton character also has an alter ego, heard but (at least in the beginning) not seen in the film.And as if this weren't enough, the movie is filmed as if it were one long shot. No close-ups, no cross-shots, no sudden cuts. It gives the film a real-life feeling: the audience follows the characters wherever they go, even when they move through the corridors of the Broadway theatre, or when they're walking to a bar. There are cuts, but they are very subtle.It takes a while before you find out how it all works and connects. But once you do, it's gripping. The film also keeps on surprising with cinematographic gimmicks. The one scene which mocks Hollywood blockbusters is hilarious, but so is the scene which mocks the intellectual New York theatre crowd.As a matter of fact, Raymond Carver is my favourite writer. After I came home from the cinema, I took his collected short stories from the book case and reread 'What we talk about when we talk about love', the short story the play is based on. It's a great piece of literature. And 'Birdman' is a great piece of cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
mixed feelings,"This movie had some of the best cinematography of 2014, such a stunning movie, the shots following the charcters walking around the hallways of the theater, are so brilliantly excecuted. It gives you this chaotic felling, which is exactly what its supposed to, because Riggan is a chaotic character. You really feel like youre inside of his head. Keatons performance was amazing, and i loved the dynamic between him and edward norton. The two of them were the highlights of the movie, and they stole every scene they were in. Mike shiner went from being this crazy dude around Riggan to this nice guy around Sam. It was such amazing acting all around. The script was so good aswell. The thing that drags this movieall the way down to a seven, is the way that they included birdman. It felt like they had this brilliant drama film, but the director just loved superheros, so he had to include one. It was like he couldnt decide if it should be a superherofilm or not, so he just made it a bit of both. And it did not work. It felt so messy. It would have been way better without, and it just ruined the atmosphere of the film. I didnt have a problem with the Dream sequences and the hallucinations ETC. But it was when it actually happened, it was so meesy and dumb. Like why would an Riggan who was athe actor of a superhero have the superheros powers when he wasnt acting?? It was not even creative. To be fair the movie was probably a 7.5, but when i had to choose whether it was gonna be a 7 or 8. I couldnt give it an 8, because of the terrible ending. The ending at the theatre was good, but without spoiling. The final end sequence is terrible and messy, and probably the worst part of the film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
A highly brilliant interpretation of all of our lives,"This movie is hard to describe if you are not aware of the world and your own life and even the fake parts of it.In this movie Keaton played himself but at the same time he did not.It was like he was being his FAKE self.He wasn't acting but at the same time he was.In essence this movie shows the entire reality even what we call ""fake"" parts of it like our alter egos and spiritual selves.The truth is that reality is BOTH truth and lie and that lies as such do not exist and are part of the truth that is reality.Like the ying yang symbol which represents good and evil intertwined together and each making a whole that is the symbol and reality.Keaton was amazing as well as Edward and everyone else that actually LIVED this movie(not acted it).This is reality.This is YOU.There isn't a fake or true you.just YOU.(this movie deserves like 20 something Oscars)SEE IT.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Good film,"Good film. The music, such as it is - nothing but somebody jamming on the drums, or some child playing piano, is distracting. Good film though. The camera work, just so much more cliché shaky-cam which has become so popular lately, makes it difficult to follow. And every opportunity for subtle nuances are lost. There should be a theory taught in film school - never move the camera unless you have a reason to. Because this dockers commercial BS is so 1990s. Get over it an move on to something new. Birdman is a fictional tale of a washed up action film actor trying to establish his importance as an artist. It's fiction and yet biographical. Michael Keaton, one of the most talented actors of our time, came to world-wide stardom in Batman. And ever since then it seems like his work has been underrated.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Best Acting Period,"Love him or not Michael Keaton rocks, and as Birdman he is the bomb, Totally love this movie and all the actor's, it has guts, with plenty of charisma and adult entertainment, I only wish I could of jumped into the picture and adlibed lines of love for each moment without being a distraction, but to be a real actor and entertain people, to make them believe what your saying is real and do it from a script is a really tough job, never mind remembering all of your lines and their's if your brain is that gifted, for me Birdman is about a hero character named Batman that was best ever played by Michael Keaton, yes he has done a lot of other great work, but in my mind he tops Batman in this role, Edward Norton, Emma Stone, Zack Galfinas all bring it too, but I just wanted to say more than anything, this is the kind of great movie making that makes me want to become a actor, director, writer, producer that is just a dream for most and especially me because I don't like being in the spotlight, everyone who made this movie clearly have earned their wings and do.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Flawless,"All of these 1 star reviews are pretty surprising, I found this movie to be one of the greatest films of last year! The Best Picture Oscar was very well deserved! The acting by all of the cast (which includes Michael Keaton. Edward Norton, Zach Galifianakis, Emma Stone, Naomi Watts, etc.) was great! Michael Keaton did an amazing job in the main role, as a man who used to play a superhero called Birdman, and is, now trying to become appreciated as a serious actor, and is putting on a play.The film is a darkly comedic, visually beautiful, surrealist satire of the film industry. It is both funny and even very dramatic at times! I mean, the movie was great on every single possible level, and has everything I love in a movie!

Virtuous! Even If I'm Ignorant,"If Michael Keaton doesn't win the Oscar for his role, I'll shoot my nose off to spite my face! This film is absolutely amazing in it's assembly, dialog and acting. Don't ask me how, but Ed Norton pulls off an amazing James Dean in this. And sadly what kept me from giving this movie a 10 is that he wasn't in it enough. But the other 9 go to Michael Keaton. Somehow he exudes himself, Riggin Thomas, Christian Bale, and Bruce Wayne through out. The irony of it all, and the fact that Keaton IS such a good actor outside of his previous typical roles in such a untypical movie about a play that will surely win Keaton recognition that he may or may not actually crave in reality... To grapple with all that, and pull off such a brilliant performance in spite of it all...? And for any other self imposed 'critic' to say 'Meh' here or the New York Times, It just makes me realize the importance of Norton and Keaton's confrontations with the feared 'critic' in the movie. And what an asshole I must look like now. Damn, my head hurts, I think I better lie down for a bit. Smells like an awesome movie in here.

Michael Keaton's best performance ever! It's a bird life and bird on the brain!,"Finally saw ""Birdman"" and I must say that it was a pleasure a film that was entertaining and a joy, as Michael Keaton does fly and soar in this role of past his prime actor Riggan Thomas. I always liked Keaton in my opinion he was the best ""Batman"" ever Michael always had range and depth with his acting choices, and with this he nails the best performance of his life! Keaton plays Riggan Thomas a past his prime washed up actor who after many years of success starring in a superhero franchise called ""Birdman"" decides to fold the tent on the role. And now Riggan has taken up life on the Broadway circuit making a living as a stage actor in plays. And Riggan's life is a mess he's divorced and he deals with a march to the beat of her own drum daughter named Sam(Emma Stone)who's just got out of drug rehab. And while working on the play Riggan has conflicts and personal clash problems with his co stars first up is the arrogant and playboy type method actor Mike(Edward Norton)and Mike is hitting on Riggan's daughter Sam and also he's trying to put moves on fellow co star and play cast member the emotional and cute colored bra wearing Lesley(Naomi Watts). Thru it all Riggan is dealing with family and his critics and his ego, and most of a challenge is how ""The Birdman"" memory haunts him Riggan hears voices and has visions of his once beloved superhero character. Overall this film entertains and is one that shows life is a challenge when you try to overcome people, and ego still if you have good memories on the mind it can help you soar to new heights in life just like that of one Riggan Thomas.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

I have no idea how they managed to make such a great movie in such small period of time. I'm big fan of Emma Stone and she definitely deserves Oscar for this performance.

Birdman is a Modern Day Sunset Boulevard.,"In Birdman (2014) Michael Keaton plays Riggan Thompson, an actor with a career path not unlike his own. Riggan was once Birdman, a Batman-esq blockbuster comic franchise. Only now Riggan is in the twilight of his career and is attempting to make it back to relevance with a Broadway play. One that he funded, directed, adapted and stars in. Riggan's play cast consists of Mike played by Edward Norton, his girlfriend Laura (Andrea Riseborough) and Leslie (Naomi Watts). Waiting in the wings to help support Riggan in his production are his assistant Jake played by Zach Galifianakis and his fresh from rehab daughter Sam, played By Emma Stone.We join the cast a few days outside of opening night during preview shows. The play seems doomed to fail from all kinds of casting, financial and critical pitfalls. Although the problems of the production all pale in comparison to its biggest issue, Riggan is a total delusional schizophrenic. All of the delusions play out first hand so we can see his madness in all its explosive glory. Riggan Thompson is a modern day Gloria Desmond in Sunset Boulevard, looking for his grand return to the silver screen and his last big close up.I must admit I had mixed feeling about director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu. I loved his early work in Amores Perros (2000). It was exhaustingly dramatic but the visual style and direction were powerful. Then with 21 Grams (2003), Babel (2006) and Biutiful (2010) I had decided that while a very effective and visually stunning director, his work was all way too dark for me. Maybe the artistic and symbolic message was lost on me. Overall I just couldn't help but feeling that he was a film canister is half empty type of director. Too dark and tragic to be entertaining, or enjoyable.Birdman is a wonderful departure from his previous films. Birdman is just as dark, yet there is a small silver lining of bitter sweet dark comedy to make it unforgettable. Alejandro has said in interviews that his films are an extension of himself. I can't help but wonder if this new found levity to his subjects means he has found happiness. The cinematography and direction in Birdman are unlike anything I have seen. The camera weaves in out and around the theater, with long, mind blowing steady cam shots and seamless time progression shots. The Broadway set is like a more elaborate version of Wes Anderson's diorama style sets. It is as much a character in the story as an of the actors.Michael Keaton delivers an Oscar worthy performance. Playing the tormented actor haunted by the inner voice of his Birdman big screen persona. The voice taking on the Christian Bale style deep, heavy smoker Batman. There are moments of madness and tenderness in Keaton's performance that rival any of his other roles. Edward Norton, as if it needs to be said, is phenomenal. Delivering sharp, rapid fire dialogue with laser point accurate timing and precision. Emma Stone as the daughter is a stand out supporting performance. Her role is a dark departure from the wide eyed cutesy teen characters she has played in the past. Zach Galifinakis as Riggan's assistant is deeper than his usual comic relief role, yet no less funny. The performances have such impact, the dialogue alone could play out amazingly as a radio drama; even without all of the pop and magic of the cinematography.Birdman's message is about what being a global celebrity can do to an actor. Specifically what happens to those who have fallen out of the lime light. With critics and social media there is now no end to the level of torture a person struggling for acceptance can be subjected to.In the dressing room Michael Keaton's character Riggan has a quote on his mirror ""A thing is still a thing, no mater what people say about it"". At the end of this film I couldn't help but think of the late Robyn Williams. A man brilliant in his work, loved by millions and yet tortured by inner demons, that eventually resulted in his demise.This film is a testament to all of the great talent we have lost one way or another, burned up under the harsh magnifying glass of their own stardom.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Not original,"The film is about an actor who's is popular because of some comic movies who made back in 1992 , and since then hi is then he is trying to make an ""artist"" name out of him playing in a Broadway theater. The casting is very clever because Michael Keaton is used ( an actor who played Batman in 1992, and except that role he is unknown to the public). This is very smart but not that original , since Darren Aronofsky has made the same thing in ""The Wrestler"" when he used Mickey Rourke to play a almost forgotten wrestler. If you see the movies you will realize lots of commons in the plot, the artwork etc, the symbolism etc The movie succeeds in make you emotional for the main character but I think that there is lots of wordy characters with problems quite irrelevant from the main plot. This film is worthy watching but not something great and original.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Keaton is shining in his later years,"I am a big fan of Michael Keaton, and I have to say, I've loved so much of his work in recent years. He is one of the most underrated actors, in my opinion.This film was a rollercoaster. ""Dark comedy"" is often a misleading genre, it seems. Some folks see it and think ""it's a comedy film!"", but that's not what a dark comedy is. It'll make you laugh at times, but the film is much more of a drama, to me.What might first appears to be a run-of-the-mill funny/comic book-type flick is in reality a wonderfully acted, well-paced, and very, very fun drama that has a top class cast.

Super Realism,"From what I saw the movie speaks about itself the entire movie. The actors are acting foolishly their role of actor acting a piece on stage. There is a mise en abysm that talks all the time to the viewer giving the feeling that at some point the real actors are improvising the movie. This makes their role all appear very narcissistic but actually real as if they didn't had the time to think the movie but instead had to live within its course as the camera rolls and that is what let them become someone on screen. Actors seems sold to the desire of the movie that will just run with or without them. The play ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"" in the movie is actually the movie Birdman. Thus the miracle of an empty space becoming a real movie.Birdman is probably someone ability to reunite all those actors and just make a movie about a movie and show on screen what it looks like in reality when the miracle of Birdman occurs. Like their counterpart that seems to change the script at each representation, the movie is also an attempt that would be different every night. In the film, the actors literally undress as if they were asked to do something crazy and had only a second to decide which resolved in them undressing themselves, a thing that give the feeling that all those naked bodies where not in the script and makes us think that probably a lot of the movie has been created during the editing. Anyway dialog seems meaningless in the movie. There is a feeling that this movie is about real actors living theirs actors life on stage while the movie is filming itself.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

It sometimes feels like It is all over the place and we are sometimes going in completely different directions from what I think the director was tying to state.The storyline mostly focuses on the main character without any real focus on completing or empathizing for any B or C stories. We of course have the wife, daughter and coworker situation but non of these feels fully resolved in the end.

Must see. Caw!,"I have no doubt this film will be dissected and studied in film classes for generations to come. Why? Put simply, it reset the bar for ""masterpiece"". It is at once bold and surreal, funny and deeply moving, grounding and satirical, and most of all poignant and provoking. The cinematography was certainly off-beat, but brilliantly so, as it left me entranced upon the actors as they flew around the dingy corners of the narrow (and at times soaring) avenues. Michael Keaton easily stole ""the show"", and delivered quite possibly the most versatile and breathtaking performance I have seen from an actor in my life time. Nay, I kid you not. And Edward Norton and Naomi Watts both rose far above the challenge shown in previous roles, to say nothing of Emma Stone's bringing of the heat, which was turned up considerably more than in her typical ""geeky girl next door"" roles. Zach Galifianikis, while very svelte, seemed slightly uncomfortable among the rest of the cast, yet still managed to bring more sophistication and class than previously shown. The writing was brilliant. The execution of the narrative was impeccable. This movie deserves to be in every theater, but sadly, it isn't.

The Perfect Metaphor,"Long shots, with little to no editing during scenes - the perfect way to relate the art of film to the art of theatre which it depicts, where crew and cast get one chance as they are live, Birdman captures its scenes continuously, amazing us at how a whole crew and cast have achieved such perfect sequences. Then somehow special effects are thrown into the mix, and we're left wondering ""how?"". I had to watch again just to admire the film production techniques, as appreciating both these and the story presented seemed too much to handle in one viewing.Birdman is also clever in its combination of imagination and reality, showing us the action and what must be a daydream of sort, with no separation so we don't know where to draw the line. All we know is that this is how Riggan (Michael Keaton) sees it, and that is the only perspective we need, allowing us Riggan's internal point of view in a way normally exclusive to novels. On my second viewing, I found myself questioning even more, what ""actually happened"" in the film.Birdman tells us the story of Riggan, an actor who formerly played a superhero, trying to adapt, direct and star in a play, in a career revival attempt. During this story, we are invited back stage where Riggan has to manage his business and personal lives, involving a challenging co star, daughter, ex partner, and lawyer, all of whom have demands he must cater to for his show to happen. Everyone has their moment, and all the characters stand out as some point, with Riggan's central story sometimes retreating and serving as a vessel for theirs to happen around his. Expectations are not met, and some moments of this film will cause complete disbelief, as each character reaches an extreme in their arc.Unique in its subject matter, production techniques, it is rare for a film to be so different from everything else and still be this good. Nothing I, or anyone can write, will do the film justice, You have to watch it, must watch film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"Good, not Great","Oscar Season and Birdman by Alejandro González Iñárritu is the first 2015 ""Oscar-buzz"" film I have seen. Iñárritu chronicles Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) attempting to gain credibility as an actor by writing, directing and acting in his own Broadway play. Thomson is haunted by his past action hero persona, dogged by his fans, loathed by theatre critics and undermined by his celebrated co-star Mike Shiner (Edward Norton).The movie relishes in turning the mirror on its audience, its cast, its crew and its critics. While this can be fun at times, it easily swings right round and is heavy handed. The symbolism that Iñárritu choose becomes so obvious he might as well have been in the theatre asking me: ""Have you got it yet?"" This over-emphasis makes me wonder how much influence Iñárritu had over the final cut as it seems that it was purposefully cut and marketed as ""Oscar bait"".Cinematography in this film is magnificent, everything is cut to look like one constant hand-held shot. Iñárritu employs simple but clever cutting techniques, such as letting a door close fully to allow an actor to walk back through it to start another scene. This is the real fun of the film, it creates a great sense of the theatre and continuity and this is something you will see many others trying to imitate.I loved the acting in this film; Michael Keaton just blew me away with his range in the film, it would be almost shameful for him not to win an Oscar. The supporting cast was equally impressive, with Norton playing probably the richest character I have seen him play in awhile. The subtly of Norton's performance comes from his character never really breaking his stage persona, and once again this adds so much depth to the film. Watts and Stone, however, were lumped with clichéd characters and while their performances were impressive, the limited female presence in the film left me irked.Script-wise the film is a bit shallow. It's a simple plot whose end is transparent from the beginning, it works, but some careful attention could have made it much tighter. The dialogue can be hollow; sometimes this is intentional and other times its distracting. In my opinion possibly chopping off 10-15 minutes would have allowed a smoother flow to the film.Overall, mostly funny, condescending all too often, and I have a feeling that I am either going to love or hate by this film by the end of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Why are people saying this is so bad??,"I saw Birdman, twice, and am starting to wonder if I saw a completely different film than anyone else did. I loved it. The performances were spectacular. The directing, writing, score, and cinematography were all perfect. Literally everything was amazing. Don't listen to all the Birdman haters out there, watch this movie. There are so many reasons to watch it. I think the reason that so many people are hating on this movie is because it is not what one would expect when walking into it. It is, and I cannot stress this enough, not what one would expect from any movie, let alone a Best Picture winner. I watched this in the theater the first time I saw it and after I had seen it I walked out saying ""What the f**k just happened"". It was not at all what I had expected I would be seeing. When I saw it the second time, at home, I was able to fully appreciate all of the comedy, weirdness, and general coolness of the movie, because I knew what to expect. For all the people who didn't like this movie, try watching it a second time, you'll probably like it a lot better. Also try to take this movie for what it is, a comedy that satires the Hollywood machine. It is that, and nothing more than that.

"Enthralling, entertaining, and likely enduring","Birdman is the story of what a man will do to be noticed again, and of all the people around him that are making that happen.I don't know if this deserves to win best picture of the year or not, I haven't seen all the nominated films. I would say this is one of the best pictures I have seen this year. It manages to be depressing or uplifting depending on what's happening, so it's a bit of a ride. That is a strength. While I did not always like the characters, I always felt invested in them regardless. They all have their moments.Edward Norton is in my opinion the best actor or actress in this film. His character is not per se a ""good person"" by any means, in fact he is capable of being a rather bad one. But his character was the realest to me, and I would blame it on Edward Norton's powerful performance.That said, all the acting is fantastic. It seems like they all pushed themselves or perhaps it is because of the director. This film may not be for everyone, I would label it artsy, and it reminded me of Black Swan. Not because it is super tense, but because sometimes the story and the style are similar. Emma Stone was very believable and charming as the daughter of the protagonist and it was interesting to see Zach Galafanakis take on a more serious role. Naomi Watts put in a very emotionally charged performance and felt very sympathetic towards her character.I think the play withing the movie did not actually seem particularly good, but that is perhaps intentional because the qualification of the main character's ability to make real ""art"" is held in contention as part of the story.Anyway, worth seeing if you are okay with something different, and if you are, you may really love this one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

As an Australian I surely found myself squirming in my seat every time she appeared on screen knowing that she was dragging this movie down with her poor imitation of an actor and that was quite surprising considering that this is the crux of the movie... being mainly about acting.

I can't deny how it's cinematography style is perfect and captivating along with the amazing performances by everybody (except Emma Stone who I don't really know whether she was nominated for being good or cause the year 2014 lacked good performances in this category being the least person with time on screen and also with emotions!) but that is just not good enough to save it's way of trying to be so much a film that you set as an example for movie making for those who want to learn, and don't get me wrong this style is not bad but it cannot be left with interpretation for what's happening at some points which I guess Christopher Nolan is the best director ever to do it with clearing the difficult things up at proper times of the movie and not leaving you with scenes that are like difficult verses of poems that not all people will get it. Some people loved it, others didn't but this time I am on the latter side with no reason for the ones who loved but they only like what they don't understand but still amazed by it's style of making but I give it a 7.5/10 .",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
One shot wonder...Nothing follows.,"I'm the kind of person who always try to see the good in almost everything but for this one, I have hard time. huh..AWFUL story, pretentious script, good actors but boring plot. I don't understand why it won the best picture. I would still prefer seventh son movie (which is one of the worst films recently) over this crap. OK, no crap at all because of the divisive, ambitious 'one shot effect' of the movie. But other than that, It sucks. For the directors, nice attempt to do something different with the cinematography but please always make sure that the movie itself is remarkable for its story and characters (It's just that Birdman himself is not remarkable and recognizable enough) i understand that it is not a superhero movie but the protagonist is not worth sympathizing with.

"Without me, all that's left is you.","This movie is one of the best artistic movie of recent times. If you want to catch a break from all the action, fights, CGI, crumbling earth and superheroes fighting the evil with definite ending, this is the movie you want to watch.Director has done the Oscar winning job with the one shot direction and all the characters are true to the core when it comes to people working on the Broadway.The score is subtle and still somehow throbbing with just one instrument being used in the background.I will have to admit, I was quite skeptical before checking this movie out as I was not sure what to expect, the poster did not make any sense to me. But I believe that was for the best. The movie takes you out of the regular Hollywood experience and makes you realize the importance of theater and the thirst so many real artists share for being on Broadway. You feel one of them and realize how powerful the concept of theater is.Michael Keaton deserved an Oscar for this one, alas he didn't get one though.True masterpiece and a definite watch for drama lovers.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
An experience as much as a film,"In Birdman actors play a version of themselves. Keaton plays a washed up ex superhero movie star who wants to gain recognition and respect as an artist and actor by doing a deep Broadway play. Norton plays a self righteous and difficult to work with talented actor (which is the reputation he has in real life). Iñárritu and his DP did a technical tour de force by making the film (appear) as one shot (with the help of the VFX guys no doubt) but that alone makes viewing this film an extraordinary experience. The score consists only of a guy playing drums (you actual see him in the background several times) in different tempos but it works very well - though that makes the score more supporting and less interesting to listen to on it's own (like the score of Interstellar e.g.). This film which was Keaton's first lead role in 6 years will surely put him back on the map in Hollywood. As much as I liked this movie it was not as good as Nightcrawler because of several reasons: the film is a bit long and Gylenhaals performance is more enjoyable then Keaton's so the Oscars can go to Nightcrawler for me. But certainly check it out, it's as much an experience as it is a film!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Birdman Takes Flight To My List of Favorite Movies,"Birdman is one of the greatest films i have seen in recent memory. I had heard a lot of buzz about Birdman and if it is possible this movie surpassed the hype laid upon me before watching this film.This film is about a man Riggan played by Michael Keaton who is putting on a play to try and revive his career after years of playing the notorious charter Birdman.He is doing this to prove that he is no washed up actor like everyone thinks he is.The first notable attribute to this film is the way it was directed.Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu is the director of this film and he blows it out of the water.This film was shot and edited to look as if it was one giant take.This is relevant because the movie is based around a play witch is all one take if you don't count intermission.I know imaging a film all in one shot might seem impossible but Gonzalez using clever camera tricks makes its so you don't even notice the cuts. Other than that the shots he sets up are fluid and nice to look at.All of this put together makes it seem that you are passively watching these charters at all times.This is a big way the movie hooks you feel like your with the charters and make you feel more attached to them and the actions they take.Second the casting for this movie was spot on.Michael Keaton as a actor who seemed to disappear for years after his super hero role and make a come back could not have been more perfect.Also the chemistry between the whole cast including Edward Norton,Emma Stone,Naomi Watts etc. This cast together not only creates great dialogue but also makes it feel so real and funny.If you are a movie buff you will love this movie , not only because of the technicality and acting but the satire too.This film pokes fun at the movie business and movie media.So making a review about a movie that make fun of movie critic's almost feels like a crimeOn my final note it doesn't matter if you are a movie buff or not, you will mostly likely enjoy this movie or love it like i did. I'm going to give this movie a 9-10 because i don't rate anything 10 because nothing perfect and that means perfect. On the other hand this is about as close to perfect as you can get.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"Interesting, thought provoking, uncomfortable, lingering","I review few movies, usually the ones that bother me or move me to places I rarely go and may not visit more than a few times. I enjoyed Birdman but probably wouldn't see it again. Birdman drew me into a setting I rarely see where dynamic characters clashed or danced in their humanity. A number of aspects of the movie, such as the cinematography, while interesting, are beyond my expertise. I sympathized with several of the characters who all seemed were treading the waters of their own internal conflict. For me more of a drama than a comedy. This is worth watching at home, in a comfortable seat, with time to burn and an open mind. Some, not all, will understand, or enjoy it. I hope you do.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Self-congratulatory dross,"This movie is essentially Hollywood giving itself one big pat on the back.

The movie's filled with self- referential, unfunny inside jokes about the film industry. The one redeeming aspect was Edward Norton, who was, as usual, excellent. The fact that this won ""Best Picture"" only shows how pathetically desperate for validation the Hollywood elites are. Completely forgettable.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
learn to fly,"I think that people writing negative reviews got mislead by the trailer. I had some false hopes myself and expected a drama in CGI environment, yet eventually i've seen a great movie.Birdman is a psychological portrait of a strained actor whose mainstream career took a turn twenty years before the events portrayed in the movie. This parallel with real-life situation of Michael Keaton and his reluctance to stay on board the Batman franchise in 1990s was a nice touch.In the given environment Alejandro G. Iñárritu has some surprisingly positive moments and didn't only intend to drag us through the shards of main character's life. His state of mind dictated the tempo and came across in a convincing pseudo single shot, a long take that stretched across the whole movie. The soundtrack, consisting mostly of jazz improvisation, underlines the strain to which our hero has been exposed.If you like theater, then Birdman might be interesting for you. It actually is a theater piece brought to screen and mocks the industry and the media surrounding it. Because, the real power is not your motivation, qualities or achievements, but how many people clicked on the link in which you've appeared.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"Best Acting, Best Directing yes, Best Picture of 2014, Maybe Not","This is a most intriguing picture, insofar as while it mines themes previously explored in movies, it does so with an absolutely amazing fresh approach, brilliant cinematic style, and some of the best acting talent on display. The themes it explores are not original -- male midlife crisis, self-doubt about being an artist, and regret about failed parenthood. It also takes a swipe at Hollywood establishment movies, which is not original. However, this movie takes such themes to an extremely personal level in the main character, with a commercial movie alter-ego in full combat with an inner artist who longs for the live stage as an ultimate defining dimension to define his legacy. The torment here is not unlike 'Barton Fink', and so while reiterating that the movie plows old ground, Michael Keaton takes it to the most profound, and thereby compelling level. For this, he definitely deserved the Academy Award and the Golden Globe of Best Actor, hands down. And Edward Norton, as both an intellectual and artistic foil to Keaton's character fully warranted the Best Supporting Actor award. Add these absolutely brilliant performances to the Director's style, which involves the longest single-pull shots and carefully orchestrated actor movement since Robert Altman, and you have a movie that cannot be ignored or relegated to any level lower than Good or Very Good. Was it the very best motion picture of 2014? Sadly, no, not among those nominated, and noting of course that those nominated seem to have been somewhat hit-and-miss, but then aren't voting members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences a real mixed bag anyway?!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"Beautifully shot, complex story","Upon watching Birdman I was left with a sense of bedazzlement. The movie features great performances with characters that are a reflection of the real world. The long takes by Iñárittu are wonderfully executed and exceptionally supported by great lighting and a competent cinematography. Still the whole experience felt somewhat underwhelming.To summarize, this movie is about Riggan Thomson, a man famous for portraying Birdman, a comic book superhero. Now he is trying to shed this association as he attempts to make it big on Broadway with an adaptation he writes, directs and stars in. Keaton was off course a perfect choice given his background as Batman in the late80's/early 90's. I feel that this movie expertly satirizes the pop culture aspects of today in a way that doesn't offend. Since I am as much a fan of this type of movie as I am of the blockbuster, I can relate to that. While Riggan is the main focus, characters like Mike, Lesley and Sam all offer their version of a real life person. Norton's Mike is a mockery of the method actor that seems to over accentuate everything when it comes to their art. Stone's Sam is the typical messed up daughter of a once famous actor and to a lesser degree, Watts's Lesley is that actress that doesn't know what happened to her ambitions as a performer. I do admit that last one isn't that apparent. All in all, these three and other main cast members do a stunning job.Birdman is a movie that did seem to wanna say something about the current world. It's problems along with how people from a different time are adapting and coping with themselves. Still the message fails to fully come across, at least for me. However I still applaud what is an otherwise well made film.Rating: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Long tony awards opening,"This movie is tony awards opening (120 minutes version) for me. Tony awards opening is live, I suppose. But this movie is not live. Just had long take! I know that long takes has meanings. But I want to watch the pressure of acting. Actors had pressure because of long takes. That's little bit ridiculous. If they are great actors, they can act of pressure like live. They don't need long takes do they?Russian Ark(2002) is more artistic and poetic. CG artworks are more amazing and importance in Black Swan. This movie remixed many ideas from a lot of films. (That's not bad way if you want to make movie.) But nothing added itself.

"good existential movie, plot was so-so","Although I felt the plot was more original than most movies that have come out recently, I still felt it did drag out in some parts. There were a lot of hard to follow ""whisper fights"" that made the movie tense to an uncomfortable level at some points. I did really like the cinematography and set design of this movie though, the music was also a bonus, I admired it for the jazzy instrumental glow it gave to the movie. There needs to be more movies with instrumental soundtracks, it adds a certain charm to the scene it accompanies. One of the other things I really admired about the movie was the camera work, the angles were personal and intriguing, they gave me an almost dazed feel, I felt more absorbed into the world the movie created. But that may be just me, I'm a sucker for lighting, set design, and camera work. The ending (which I won't spoil for you) was better than I thought it would be. It was surprising and left just enough to be desired. The movie over all was good, I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a more intellectual move, this doesn't seem to be something children could follow.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Self-absorbed actors and directors,"I don't think there's another film that's more about actors than this. Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's Birdman is a self-searching character piece about an actor caught between different demands of the craft (art vs. Commerce) while all of his personal problems are about the existence of being an actor. No wonder Hollywood loved it. I mean, it's a technical marvel with a lot of good performances, but, you know, it's kind of obvious from beginning to end. There's virtually no subtlety to the point, and it becomes obvious very early. That robs it of much of the joy of discovery when characters just flat out talk about the central ideas. It's weird instead.Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) is a former superhero movie star of the three Birdman films who is sinking all of his money onto a Broadway production of Raymond Carver's story ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"". He's having problems everywhere, mostly how his opposite leading man, Ralph (Jeremy Shamos) that both Riggan and his best friend and lawyer and producer, Jake (Zach Galifianakis), is terrible. When Ralph is accidentally hit in the head by a falling spotlight, the production is in a panic until the leading lady, Lesley (Naomi Watts), suggests her boyfriend and famous actor, Mike (Edward Norton). At the same time, the other leading lady, Laura (Andrea Riseborough) is his girlfriend with news of a pregnancy while his adult daughter Sam (Emma Stone) is his assistant while dealing with recovery from drug addiction.Gosh, that sure does sound like a lot of prime material for actors to have their moments to act! It's a good thing most of them are really good at it. I say most because there's one moment, one key moment, that just feels wrong and it's entirely about the believability of the performance.So, personalities clash. Mike is a control-freak method actor who gets up in the middle of a preview performance because Riggan replaced real gin with water, smashing the bottle against a wall. Sam regularly freaks out because Riggan was a terrible father and has seemingly impossible demands (like a particular kind of flower that she can't find in any shop). Laura is mad at Riggan for not being excited enough about the news of the pregnancy. Sam seems to contemplate suicide by resting on the edge of the roof, though Mike can see through her because, you see, we're caught between things. Between reality and fantasy, because real life and the stage, between hope and despair. It's obvious because at least three characters say it a couple of times each. There's no trust for the images to work for themselves, and I find that very frustrating.Now, the moment that kind of damages the whole acting package comes when Riggan is confronting Mike over an interview he did where he cribbed bits from Riggan's own life as his own, in particular a connection to Carver that Mike took whole cloth. Riggan breaks down, and it's honestly not that convincing. It feels rehearsed and forced, but then Mike falls for it. It's such a weird moment.Anyway, the whole thing is whirling increasingly surrealistically towards opening night when the critic, Tabitha Dickinson (Lindsay Duncan) who has promised to destroy the play with her review because she hates Riggan and all he represents (the crass commercialization of art, no matter his intentions on that stage). Around him, reality begins to breakdown as the voice of Birdman begins to manifest more physically, Riggan does more impossible things like flying across the city (explained with a pan that he just took a cab), and even at one point locks himself out of the backstage in the middle of a performance and has to run around, through Times Square, to make his entrance through the front doors, using his finger as a gun.What does all of this business amount to? What everyone talks about: finding your true self between opposing forces, making one or the other. Dramatically, I find that it works quite well. It just really didn't need all of the dialogue endlessly making that point at the same time. Riggan desperately wants to be taken seriously as an actor, so he goes to the extreme to do it (super-realism the critic ends up calling the choice), and then we get the kind of interminable ending of ""did he actually jump out a window?"" that I kind of hate because I understand the point of the whole thing and I didn't need the magical realism stinger on the end to drive it home.The real star of the film is how Inarritu filmed it, using long, extended takes and stitching them together through editing and digital trickery, this is a thing that I've grown increasingly exhausted of because the trickery has become so obvious over time. I'm sure I don't see every hidden cut or digital swipe, but I see a lot of them. Yes, it makes the one-takes somewhat easier because your camera, crew, and cast aren't trying to hit literally thousands of marks in one go, but the magic of the free-flowing, jazzy feels when you can see the whip pans, the moments to put in wipes, and the outright mismatches when not done quite right (there's a moment as Riggan and Mike are walking down the street that is really obvious). It makes me feel like an more traditional approach would have worked just as well.That leads me to the score, a fun, extended jazz drum solo Antonio Sanchez, and I think it ends up being used as tape to cover transitions a surprising amount. I mean, the drum solo is propulsive and works, especially in context, but it really does seem to amp up when there's nothing on screen for a moment. So much of the filmmaking effort seems to be about covering up the awkwardness of the transitions between one part of the shot to the next, like Inarritu and his editors underestimated how long it all took and used the spectacle of the drums to cover it up, giving the film energy that otherwise lagged.So, it's well-made, though fake. It's well-acted, though with one key central performance giving some bad notes. It's got something to say, and it won't let you miss it. So, I find it a technical showcase, anchored by performance, and just too obvious for its own good. It's a good ride while it lasts, but I don't think it's too much more than that.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
American angst,"Gonzales' Iñárritu's 'Birdman' tells the story of a once famous movie star trying to rebuild his career, and his sense of self-worth, as a theatre actor. Cue some comedy and a lot of very American angst, as the hero (and his fellow-protagognists) reveal themselves to be simulatenously needy and priveleged. My problem was that I didn't really know what I was supposed to be feeling - I certainy couldn't imagine spending any time with any of these people (or at least, I couldn't imagine enjoying it). Sometimes life is comic, sometimes life is tragic, sometimes you just have to not be so melodramatic about it, a point these protagonists don't seem to have learned.

Interesting insight into Broadway.,"After watching this film was puzzled why did they nominated it for so many Oscars.

I am sure there are a lot of people who will disagree with me, but for the Oscar race in Anno Domini 2015, I would definitely opt for Boyhood rather then this film. Boyhood is far, far, far better film then this one.As far as this film goes, acting is excellent, plot is an interesting insight into Broadway. When I lived in NYC I went to watch Broadway plays a lot and I am glad they made a film which gives an insight into Broadway world. Very interesting. I also liked editing, like this film was supposed to be one long shot. It makes it even more interesting.

"Interesting technique, good characters","Birdman garnered a lot of attention for its rarely seen cinematography, its interesting story and for its ensemble cast of actors. And deservedly so, because all those elements are what make the film so enjoyable to watch.First of all, the cinematography where the whole film is made to look like one, long, continuous shot. At first it's kind of attention-stealing, because you're looking for it, but surprisingly soon you kind of forget it's there and only notice it when the film calls attention to it by, for example, walking through halls to get to other characters. There are also a couple timeskips achieved through seeming fast-tracking, but those are also tasteful enough that it doesn't pull you away from the story. All in all it's a gimmick, but it's an interesting one.The story and the characters are what make this a good movie. The story is about Riggan, an aging actor, who is mainly known for his role as an early cinema superhero, Birdman. And now he's trying to regain some credibility by producing a play, where he's also the main actor and the writer. What's makes this so brilliant is that they got Michael Keaton, the guy who's mostly known for playing Batman years ago, to play him. If that isn't perfect casting, I don't know what is. And Keaton absolutely owns his role. Nigh perfect acting, not just from him, but also from pretty much all the main actors. Emma Stone and Edward Norton are especially noteworthy for their characters and their own subplot.All in all Birdman is a love letter to theater and to acting in general. It's a character study that examines the themes of loss, past fame, credibility, love both young and old, endurance, frustration and most importantly doing what you love. Well worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"Welcome Back, Michael Keaton","Birdman is definitely not the sort of movie for a person who can't stand art house style movies, because it has major elements of that...but I recommend that you get past those reservations, if you have them, because this is a fantastic movie. The story is a truly fascinating exploration into the life of an actor struggling desperately to regain some sort or relevance on the stage after having a film career compressed down to the point of only being remembered for a superhero role he had years before...all of this in the middle of a nervous breakdown that he is barely containing. It absolutely does not neglect the people around him though, spending an equal amount of time on the other characters in the movie. Michael Keaton is the only actor who could have brought this sort of authenticity to the role, what with his portrayal of Batman being the most memorable role of his career aside from perhaps Beetlejuice or Mr. Mom (Depending on how old you are). The whole cast is amazing though, especially Edward Norton, in a truly meta experience as he is doing an amazing job of overshadowing Keaton in the lead role both in the movie itself and the stage performance within the movie (albeit in a more intentional, malicious sense in the latter). Zach Galifianakis playing the straight man (and arguably the most reasonable and sensible individual throughout the whole movie) was a peculiar choice, but it worked out unbelievably well. I should have watched this a couple of weeks ago. If I had known I would like it this much, I would have.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"Yes, Yes, Yes","This film was awesome. I'm always skeptical of films that win Best Picture, but this one totally deserved it.It's a unique idea and it's really well acted, I mean, really, really well acted. Michael Keaton was AMAZING as Riggan. You can tell he put his absolute all into his performance. You really, sympathize with this character, this guy who really just wants another shot at his career, another shot at life. He sees this play as his second chance and he's determined not to let anything get in the way of making it and making it good. You also get really involved in the other characters. Edward Norton was amazing as this method actor, God he is a penis !!!! He was so obnoxious, the actor who just thinks he knows best, and God, I have met a whole bunch of people who are just like that. Emma Stone...how could you go wrong with her ? The writing of the film is really well written. The idea of the voice inside the head was awesome. That just continues this emphasis that this guy is really loosing his grip on reality after the birdman character (who was a huge part of this mans life) was taken out of his life.If I had any problem with the film, and it would be a minor one. It's that I don't get the ending, and I know it's meant to be open for interpretation but I just didn't get it and I'm going to need an art film fan...guy to explain it to me.

Batman...I mean Birdman!,"This has nothing to do with Batman except for the actor, of course. Speaking as a fan of Tim Burton's Batman and as a guy who likes to have an unusual but unique experience in films/TV shows/Books/Videogames, Birdman is now one of my favorite films of all time! It's one of those films where you can't really explain exactly why you love it so much because it has such a unique impact on you that you can't really find the words to describe it. A washed up celebrity who used to play an iconic superhero (kind of like the actor minus the washed up part) is starring in a Broadway adaption of Raymond Carver's book ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"" to show he is more than just formally a superhero and a real actor. But he is having trouble keeping his head straight when things go wrong and he has to fight to keep this play afloat. Michael Keaton has proved to me and everyone that he is more than just Batman, he is a real actor and a damn good one. The cinematography? Oh my god! This has to be the best cinematography I have ever seen in my entire life. I constantly ask myself, ""Why didn't they do this in the past?"" Emma Stone is pretty good, I still think she did better as Gwen Stacey from the Spider-Man reboots. Edward Norton is such an ass but he is so good at it. Zach Galifianakis? Really? He wasn't great but I don't think he did that bad.

Emotionally Volatile and Bizarre Masterpiece...,"Either ""Birdman"" is too simple but tries to make its nervous directing and real-time editing pass for intellectual complexity or if it really flies over these considerations with the insolent confidence of a real birdman. Well, I'm not sure the film is as original as it intended to be, but the treatment is one of a kind and maybe one of these cases where the form and the content redeem each other and contribute to one of these puzzling experiences that look too good not to be intentionally made to impress you, yet the result is so efficient that you almost feel guilty to fall for it.Again, Inarritu displays some infuriating wizardry, using long takes and transitions from scene to scene, that are nonexistent so that in the end, you have the confusing impression to have endured in less than two hours, a dizzying and mind-bending three-day journey swinging between arguments, confessions, improvisations, outbursts of anger, passions, feelings, reconciliations etc. It is noisy, talkative, the drum beats popping up here and there highlight the torments that can invade an individual's mind like so many hits in the head, but, say what you want about ""Birdman"", the movie is alive and full of characters with a purpose that goes beyond the simple story-line. Well theoretically, they're all present for the release of an adaptation of Raymond Carver's play, but they're also free electrons moved by their own instinct, pasts and personal issues.They all have a particular endeavor and they're all tormented enough to pull the blanket in their side when they feel the need. The result is confusing but somewhat exhilarating and that everyone stays dedicated to the play allows the film to keep its common thread, so this mess has a reason to be, and to happen. And there's the central pillar, Michael Keaton as Riggan Thompson: the has-been star. Riggan is an alter-ego of Keaton that fools no one, Keaton ensured the transition between the 80's and 90's with his portrayal of Batman, but only to sink into relative oblivion after Burton's ""Batman"" movies have been relegated to the status of their corny 60's counterpart by Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale. This is not just Riggan but Keaton's comeback and the similarities are so vivid that the performance was probably harder, because it really takes courage to laugh at yourself.Thankfully, the film isn't devoid from a sense of humor in its constant meta-referential take on showbiz; even actors find the strength to laugh at themselves, like Edward Norton playing Mike Shiner, a very difficult and volatile method actor who's a ticking bomb of unpredictability. Besides Mike Shiner, there's Riggan's daughter, Sam (Emma Stone) who just came from rehab and tries to rebuild her relationship with her Dad, there's his ex-wife (Amy Ryan), a Broadway debutante (Naomi Watts) and the manager (Zach Galifianakis), all these people gravitate around Riggan, who's like the ringmaster and the player of his own bizarre show, trying to find himself while he's not even sure to be worth whatever his conception is, constantly invaded by the voice of ""Birdman"", like a phoenix awaiting to resurrect from the ashes of the past. The conflict is between Riggan's past and future and structures the film's present made of an attempt to conquer pride and self-esteem.And it's quite impressive that, in this existential swirl, the film had time to make parallels between Riggan's struggles and the obsessions of going viral, dictated by society and affecting the youth. Speaking of celebrities, there is an important scene, Riggan meets respected critic Tabitha Dickinson (Lindsay Duncan) who's like a theater 'Pauline Kael', she doesn't take him as an actor but a celebrity, a media phenomenon, a fraud who tries to steal some prestige, he tells her that all she does is labeling things, giving sterile epithets to hide out the fact that she didn't nothing in her life, they're both part of the same hypocrisy but no one deserves resentment who tries at least to stake his life and do something about it, any Youtube commentator could get a taste of Riggan's rant. Yet these comments are relevant because everyone seeks approval and popularity.I guess what ""Birdman"" shows is that we're all driven by opposite forces, one that tells you what you're really worth, or that you're a God, or a bum, it's all about perceived, real and felt value, and how we can express any of them. The film is an eye-opening experience about people's inner needs to be accepted, but it's more about reaching the kind of state where a man can master his being and control himself in order to accomplish what he feels he's meant to do. Maybe unconsciously, but it borrows a lot from another stage-themed film about aging, John Cassavetes' underrated ""Opening Night"" where Gena Rowlands played a character in conflict with her self-perception and yet wanted to make her performance worthwhile for the audience as if the people in the theater were the incarnation of life. There might that idea that there's something in theater that encompasses life, as there are many moments where the line between reality and fantasy gets confusingly thin..Were these bits pretentious? Well, I don't think one's work wouldn't reflect part of his ego and maybe what we take from pretentiousness is the strong presence of a man's personal vision in his work. In that case, this is a real masterwork, and a dazzling drum-beat driven journey that feels like a good companion to ""Whiplash"", a co-nominee of the same year. ""Birdman"" took the Oscar home, maybe because it wasn't as linear as ""Whiplash"", it tried to go beyond the limits of imagination, or because it fooled the Academy, but maybe the talent it takes to fool the audience deserves an Oscar after all, maybe, it's all about fooling people as long as you don't make them look like fools.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Finely crafted with dark humour!,"This movie is the result of pure art! Truly a masterpiece. 
The director clearly depicted what an aspiring stage actor feels, think and work like. The movie has its own ambience which will suck you into it in no time. 
What amazes me the most is Alejandru Gonzàlez Inãrritu's marvel direction and the way he projected the deep sense of each character with in just 2.5hours which is really really hard to achieve in that amount of time. 
Should I talk about cinematography? Perfect. That's Emmanuel Leubezki for you. 
Sound mixing was on point. 
And, Michael Keaton was born for that character to play. 
The the movie ends with an adrenaline rush!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

"Beautiful, unique and thought-provoking","Birdman is dark comedy and drama film. Undoubtedly one of the most critically acclaimed films of the decade, it won four Academy Awards in 2015.The movie is about a faded Amercian actor, Riggan, who is famous for playing the character of superhero 20 years ago. Since then, his career is going through a downfall and Riggan is trying to regain recognition. There are several other memorable characters and the lead's relationship with them is pretty interesting.The film is crafted with masterful directing, music and cinematography. It's really rare for today's movies to touch the themes Birdman hit, like the issues in Hollywood, actors' life, the struggle of people with their ego, popularity, etc. It covers many different things magnificently.I would recommend this beautiful, unique and thought-provoking movie to everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

"A Beautiful, Satiracal, Character Study","Birdman is without a doubt one of my favorite films of all time. Everything from the directing to the casting is meticulously crafted to create one of the most compelling films I've ever watched. That being said, the film is by no means a superhero film. I feel that most people dislike this film because people expected it to be a superhero film. To oversimplify, the film is basically a character study of Riggan Thomson (played by Michael Keaton), a washed up actor trying to jumpstart his career by creating a broadway play. Along the way, we're treated with cinematography that presents the film as if it's one take, characters that are expertly acted by legends like Edward Norton, and a satirical message about Hollywood's fixation on the superhero genre that doesn't come across as too preachy or pretentious. Overall, Alejandro González Iñárritu crafted one of my favorite films of all time and while it may not be for everyone, it certainly left a great impression on me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Dreamwork,"The acting crew is an instant miracle and the magic between them created on set is beyond words.Michael Keaton proves that he and our elder midlife generation is still very much relevant and Edward Norton is a God's gift to art for humanity, the deserving heir of Sean Penn's enormous, prodigy talent which comes only once in a generation of Hollywood actors.Performance is amazing and veritable. During the movie and long after that one wishes to get on that imaginary stage of Broadway and just get naked and frivolous with everyone involved in the show.At the end of the day, only desirability is ingenious and relevant. Kudos, biggest yet. I'm not easily pleased but with these masterpiece I'm enchanted one.more time with cineastic& cinematic magic and it's all that matters. Put the right actor director, screenwriter and other right pieces together and you get - Birdman, a supernatural and brutally honest movie on staying relevant and surviving the passing of time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
I Knew What it was Going For,"Certain things were sprinkled throughout the movie and connected later on in an attempt to explain what is going on in Birdman's mind. While I respect the film, and applaud it for what it achieves, it did not satisfy me in all that it was trying to communicate. It falls short on explanation, which works for other films, but not completely on this one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
