Totally underrated!,"Personally, I find it hard to believe this movie is rated so lowly. It is at least a 7.5 in my books. Its far from perfect, but how many films out there actually question your beliefs and your actions and allows you to reflect on how you can live your life better? How many films make you want to know more about the film, the location, the people, the characters? Trust me, this film will make you more inquisitive and curious and probably open your eyes to the world beyond your borders.Again, it is far from perfect, but watch it and try to see where I'm coming from. If you do not share my sentiments then, at least Brad Pitt's excellent acting and the gorgeous cinematography will keep your interest.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
An Underrated Pleasure,"""Seven Years in Tibet""  was a pleasant surprise.  Sporting an Austrian accent that got slammed by some critics, I thought Brad Pitt was pretty good as an arrogant Nazi who finds himself captured by the British during a failed expedition to the Himalayas and is later stranded in Tibet after escaping from a POW camp.  He finds his humanity in the forbidden-to-foreigners city of Lhasa, especially after meeting the 14 year old Dalai Lama.  Echoes of ""Lost Horizon,"" ""The King and I"" ""Last Emperor"" and others abound, but the movie is ""old Hollywood"" in the best sense with magnificent scenery (widescreen advised: the mountains and countryside of Argentina and Canada stand in for Tibet).  The heart of the movie is the relationship between the blond Aryan golden boy and the young ""Kundun,"" with a performance by the young Tibetan actor playing the latter that is so charming he nearly steals the whole film.  An engrossing blend of fact and fiction, the picture manages to avoid condescending to the Tibetans and over-reverent preachiness.  Wrapped in an excellent production, this epic story makes entertaining viewing.  One question:  how did the young Dalai Lama come by his love of movies in that remote location?",,Anonymous,Biography
A good one -- worth another look,"I missed this film the fist time around and saw it for the first time last night on DVD. I was pleasantly surprised. It seemed to me that some extraordinary effort went into creating an accurate portrayal of the forbidden city of Lhasa, and the lives and culture of the Tibetans who are at the core of the movie.On the acting side, Brad Pitt was not quite totally believable as a German but, accent-quibbles aside, he did inhabit the character in a way that was compelling and interesting. I thought the supporting cast of Mako and (mostly) Tibetan unknowns was good and the use of these unknowns added credibility to the movie.The scenery was as beautiful as you would expect it to be -- breathtaking shots of the Himalayas dominating throughout much of the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"If it hadn't been that unnecessarily long, this would have been a masterpiece","It's too bad that the movie had to be 139 minutes long. It's not that I can't handle movies that are that long, but when watching longer movies, I expect that it has something to say during that extra time and that's where it sometimes went wrong with ""Seven Years in Tibet"". It just seemed to keep dragging on forever without contributing to the story.It needs about 2/3 of the time to show what a bad guy Heinrich Harrer actually is and only 1/3 of the time to show how he changes and gradually becomes a good man. All he thinks about is his career as a mountain climber. In 1939, just before World War II, his wife is pregnant with their first child. Harrer doesn't want to take up his responsibility and 'flees' from her by going to Tibet, where he will try to conquer Mount Nanga Parbat in the Himalayas. Because he is an Austrian and because the Nazi's already have taken over power in Austria, they will use his successes to prove that the Germans are the best race (I hope I don't have to explain the entire Nazi ideology to you, but that you paid enough attention during history class). During his attempt to reach the summit he is arrested by the British and taken to a POW-camp. After several attempts to escape he finally succeeds and together with Peter Aufschnaiter he succeeds to reach Tibet. First he is his old, bad self, but gradually he changes his lifestyle and becomes more 'Tibetan'. He even knows to get the attention of the very young Dalai Lama and becomes friends with him during the period that the Chinese took over power in Tibet.I don't know if all that is shown in this movie actually happened or to which extent some parts have been made up. Of course it is all a bit politically 'colored' (the Tibetan question is still not solved until today and so there will always be people who will choose China's side and say that what is shown here is completely wrong), but that doesn't mean that this movie doesn't carry a powerful message. But even without this message of being a good husband and not being a career driven jerk, the philosophical Tibetan approach to problems... this movie is very nice eye candy. The landscapes are absolutely stunning and Tibet really looks like a place that certainly is worth a visit. The acting is very good and it all looks very believable.So despite the fact that this movie dragged on from time to time and that it should have been a bit shorter, this still is a very nice film. I give it a 7/10, perhaps even a 7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A moving, well-crafted, and visually breathtaking film","First of all, Seven Years In Tibet is a very aesthetically pleasing film. The snowy Himalayas, the Tibetan villages, and the amazing costumes and religious ceremonies are all filmed beautifully, with rich colours and lighting. The music by John Williams is also excellent, and it's fascinating to hear how it blends with the unusual Tibetan music.It's not all surface though, there's depth here too. Don't believe the negative comments about Brad Pitt's acting. Admittedly his accent slips a bit in places, but he does a great job as Heinrich, both the unpleasant, arrogant character at the beginning, and the more gentle and wise man that he becomes as the film progresses. His relationship with the young Dalai Lama (a very impressive actor) is an unusual one and refreshingly unsentimental. The film is well edited; scenes are not drawn out any longer than they need to be. As a whole, it is fast paced but also peaceful, tender and moving. You don't get bored but you're not bombarded with pointless action scenes either.It's a pleasant surprise to see a Hollywood film where women and other cultures aren't treated as objects, and are allowed to be full, complex characters. It could be argued that this film has a Western perspective, but after all, it is adapted from a book written by a European living in Tibet, and intended for Western audiences. It treats the Tibetan culture with a great deal of respect, so I don't really see a problem with that. Similarly, those who have complained that it doesn't tell you enough about the Dalai Lama and too much about Heinrich, ultimately it is Heinrich's story, and that is its strength: that it is one man's tale, and not a political polemic. It gives you a great sense of how people's stories intersect and how the whole world is connected.Overall, an unusual film, very involving and emotional without sentimentality, with wonderful music and outstanding cinematography. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"This is a movie, not a documentary","A movie is by definition a fictional tale. It may be based - more or less loosely - on real events, but it is still a fiction.This part seems to have escaped many ""reviewers"" as it always does when a movie is based on ""real events"". In real life there are long periods when nothing exciting or interesting happens, but a movie cannot follow a character 24/7 in his daily life, even if that life takes place in Tibet.This story is very loosely based on the experience of Austrian climber Heinrich Harrer, who embarked on a climbing expedition on the brink on WWII and ended up as POW in a British camp in India, for most of the war.Having no reason to go back to Austria, he then ended up in Tibet where he met and became tutor to the 14th Dalai Lama. His adventure ended with the Chinese invasion of Tibet. That's it and it is already quite a lot.The plot is a journey of discovery, not only geographical but also psychological. Thanks to his experience, Harrer turns from selfish, arrogant and uncaring into a gentler human being.According to those who read Harrer account of his story, the film takes a lot of liberties, inventing episodes that - for me - are just supposed to make the story more cohesive. Also, I did not care much about Harrer involvement with the Nazi party, for which he apologised and that clearly was not the core of his existence.Finally, for those who protest because the movie does not explore Tibetan culture, once more this is based on Harrer's tale, from is point of view. You want to know Tibetan history and Buddhist culture? There are thousand of non-fictional books and documentaries to fulfil this purpose.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
One Of The Most Unique Adventures Of The Twentieth Century,"Tibet has certainly fascinated people all over the world. The hidden land in the most forbidding place on the planet not at either pole. In its day Lost Horrizon made quite a bit of money for its author James Hilton. But the real story of Heinrich Harrer is better than anything a fictional author could have thought up.Brad Pitt is Harrer in Seven Years In Tibet and this has become my favorite film of his. Heinrich Harrer, a world famous mountain climber and Austrian national hero goes on an expedition in 1939 to conquer an unclimbed peak in the Himalayas. While he's doing his mountain climbing Germany of which Austria is now part of marches into Poland and World War II begins. Harrer and his party are interred as enemy aliens.In 1942 Harrer escaped and he and a friend played by David Thewlis make their way into Tibet. The rest of the film is the seven years he spent there, centered around the unique friendship he formed with the child ruler of Tibet, the Dalai Lama. This in fact is the same Dalai Lama who today is possibly the world's greatest and non-aligned apostle of the gospel of peace.Brad Pitt is never better in the film than he is with the three child actors who play the Dalai Lama at various stages of his life. The physical hardship that he and Thewlis endure just getting into Tibet is adventure enough. But the spiritual journey he undergoes in his time there makes this one of the most unique adventure stories of the last century.One thing I liked about Seven Years in Tibet is that no effort was made to cover up Harrer's Nazi background. In an alternate universe one can speculate on what might have happened to him had he actually had to serve in the army in World War II. His internment saved him from possibly being involved any number of atrocities. God, fate, some kind of higher power saved him for something wonderful.The cinematography is breathtaking, this film had an incredible number of locations. Note that it was shot in British Columbia, in Argentina with the Andes serving as the Himalayas, Austria and even some establishing footage was shot in Tibet itself on the sly.Tibet's status is unique unto the world. It has been part of China since the Ming dynasty. It's referred to properly as the autonomous region of Tibet. China has given it autonomy in varying degrees over the past several centuries, it's never been truly independent. The Communist regime back in the days of Mao Tse-tung brutally asserted it's sovereignty a few times, most notably in late fifties when the Dalai Lama was forced to flee Tibet and live in Northern India where he resides to this day. That is when he's not traveling the world as it's foremost advocate of non-violence.It is sad that this film did not get more box office than it did. Brad Pitt, David Thewlis, director Jean Jacques Arnaud are all persona non grata in the People's Republic of China for making this film. Quite a market indeed to be shut out of for a stand for humanity.It's to be hoped that one day the Tibetans will be free. Until then they have their unique brand of Buddhism to sustain them and this wonderful film to tell their story.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Pretty Good, DespiteThe Bias","Even though this probably was a just a propaganda piece for the Dali Lama, I found it a surprisingly good story.Nice to see Brad Pitt in such a restrained role. Unlike Christianity, the religious matter here is treated with reverence by Hollywood but that aside, it remains an interesting story of Henrik Harrer (Pitt) his adventures getting to Tibet with his friend "" Peter Aufschnaiter"" (David Thewlis) and then his relationship to the young Dali Lama.The film is as pretty as you would expect from one in such mountainous surroundings . There are really nice colors in here and the movie looks just great on DVD. The story bogs down a bit in places but not for too long as it tells of Harrer's escape from the Western world and from participating in WWII. He winds up spending seven years in Tibet, hence the title.Finally, I thought the soundtrack was good, too, featuring an instrument I don't know but love its sound. The cinematography in here, and justifiably, gets a lot of attention, but the music is great, too.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very Uplifting,"I saw this film for the first time last night after hearing a great many people recommend it to me. I don't know why I waited so long! This is a soul stirring movie that is perfect in its simplicity. I don't think it's the best performance Brad Pitt has ever offered, but he was quite good. David Thewlis (an amazing actor who never receives as much praise he deserves) gave a perfect performance. But the real beauty of the film is the Tibetan people and their lifestyle. The cinematography was breathtaking and perfectly matched the mood of the film. I loved this movie so much that I'm going to buy it immediately. I love uplifting epic types of movies and this is truly one of the better ones I've seen in a while. In fact, it's one the better movies I've seen in a while.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Changing Your View Of Life,"30 October 2000Seven Years In Tibet takes place during the 1940s, we follow the adventure of Heinrich Harrer and experience his gruelling journey across the icy mountains, his dangerous and treacherous expedition brings him to Tibet. He grows a special relationship with the Dalai Llama but the peace and tranquillity doesn't last forever because the Chinese go on a murderous rampage whilst seeking control of Tibet.Brad Pitt plays the role of Heinrich Harrer, as soon as the film started you could notice he was finding it hard to latch on to the strong Austrian accent because it sounds as if he was over-doing himself and pronouncing every word with a stronger tone in the early scenes and then as every scene would go on he would start losing grasp of his dominant and loud-mouthed intonations. This flaw can be compared to his character in Guy Ritchie's SNATCH where he chose a role which required him to speak in a very demanding Irish accent. The character itself and its motivations were very inspiring, the physical and mental torture he gets put through changes his way of thinking and his perception of life. Overall, Brad Pitt delivers a good performance when it comes to the character's progression and evolution and his motives and struggles look believable but he had to work on the accent a bit more and give it a more balanced, genuine and realistic feel to it. Ralph Fiennes seemed to fit the role as well.The movie in itself is beautiful, the multiple locations are beautiful to look at and Tibet's rich, colourful and radiant setting is flawlessly executed. The Dalai Llama is well played by young actor Jamyang Jamtsho Wangchuk, his appearance and actions looked very believable. The cinematography is stunning, the landscapes are riveting. We get to view ice-covered mountains, the scorching desert and the combination of the two opposite weather conditions in Tibet. A multitude of different environments with diverse weather conditions. The editing is harsh and sudden, it takes the emotion of a certain scene and then quickly cuts away to something totally different. Anything special the viewer felt is suddenly interrupted because of a quick cut. A fade-out would would work a lot better and it would be able to maintain the emotion the viewer felt in the previous scenes.Seven Years In Tibet is a very enjoyable movie with a few flaws that make it lose it's charm but it's nothing too problematic. It won't keep you away from having a good time. The adventure has many twists and turns, it'll keep you attentive. French Director, Jean-Jacques Annaud has made a film that is hard to dislike, it has heart, soul and a lot of energy.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Disappointing,"Although Seven Years in Tibet certainly wasn't a short movie, it felt rushed. This is an epic story which requires a slow build.Brad Pitt is just awful in this movie.

Hopefully one day someone makes this film the right way, however it's unlikely with China's power over the movie industry these days.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
seductive,"not only for the story itself. or for impressive location. but for the values who defines a meeting and a friendship. that defines this beautiful film who, in each scene, preserves the mark of its great director. Brad Pitt does a more than good job and the rhythm of story is perfect to discover a metamorphose of a man looking himself. its great virtue - realistic - touching portrait of Tibet. not a manifesto, not a pledge. but a convincing puzzle about the identity, history, believes and manner to define reality of a land and its people. story to reflect, it is a seductive trip in a mysterious region.and the dose of poetry, characteristic of the films by Annaud, represents the perfect spice for become a memorable experience.",,Anonymous,Biography
Unique,"The movie overall was pretty decent I thought. The movie has really nice visuals - and the story is unique. I think I could have given this movie a 7.0/10.0 if someone else was playing as Heinrich. Brad Pitt doesn't do a bad job but this is a very different role for him. His accent does slip at times (no big deal), but I just didn't think Brad Pitt was a very good fit for this one.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Good film, less filmy",I am a fond of biography and movies based on historic events. I intended to watch the movie in order to know the history and the relation between Dalai Lama and Austrian Man. This movie is a bit slow with less filmy situations but clearly could bring up the vibe and essence of how strong bond Dalai Lama and the Austrian Mountaineer had. It also gives us the idea of his nature pretty much.,6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A vibrant tale of a caustic climber's change,"Heinrich Harrer is not a nice man. Driven, you might say, but overall not the most gregarious of individuals. His single-minded mission: scale a particularly difficult Alps peak in Austria. Of course, when he does so he abandons his girlfriend and their unborn child, but hey - you have to have goals in life, right? But this isn't a simple tale of a man finding himself on the mountain. You see, poor Heinrich's dream of scaling the peak isn't realized. World War II breaks out and he's taken off the mountain by Allied forces and imprisoned. He breaks out and attempts to visit Tibet, completely closed off to foreigners. Starving and cold, he eventually gains admittance, and through luck somehow becomes friends with the young Dalai Lama. It's the relationship between the two of them that changes Heinrich from a bitter, selfish, and self-absorbed young man into a diligent, thoughtful and courageous adult. At the Dalai Lama's bidding, Heinrich introduces movies to the Tibetans, and he teaches the young spiritual leader all he can about the Western world.Perhaps the most appealing thing about this true-to-life story is the casting of Brad Pitt as Heinrich. The man with the six-pack abs is not usually the first choice when it comes to the pensive roles, but Pitt pulls off the feat with style and a real sense of class. What's more, his character's transformation is gradual and perfectly plausible; it's not one of those one-minute-he's-a-jerk, the-next-minute-he's-a-saint transformations. This isn't easy for an actor to do, especially one with Pitt's maligned reputation. Mix in delightful cinematography with sumptuous scenes of Tibet itself, and you got yourself a fine movie. Don't think of it as overburdened drama, think of it as a spiritual odyssey. The true purpose and nature of this odyssey, however, remains unknown to our protagonist until he visits the ancient city of Tibet.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
But What about the Nazi SS?,"This is a visually and emotionally impressive film, with a fine lead performance by the versatile Brad Pitt and an amazing performance by the young Tibetan Jamyang Jamtsho Wangchuk, who plays the Dalai Lama aged 14 (and whose younger brother apparently played the Dalai Lama aged 8). The film is very beautiful to look at, and the Buddhist atmosphere is convincing, with a great deal of attention to ritual detail from a Tibetan production adviser. But the film raises many disturbing questions and doubts. I have not read the book, but the consensus of opinion from several reviewers seems to be that this film is highly inaccurate and that many incidents are entirely made up by the screenwriters. However, I am more troubled by the Nazi issue. Heinrich Harrer was a member of the SS, and although he is admitted in some sources to have been a sergeant, he may well really have been a commissioned officer. In the film it is admitted that Harrer was a committed Nazi when he was in Austria, which is very honest, but nothing is mentioned about the SS or that he would therefore have been under SS military orders when he went to Tibet (indeed, he could not have gone in any other capacity, since he was in the SS and had met Hitler). Harrer's internment by the British in India during the War was thus not of an ordinary harmless Austrian mountain climber but of a soldier of the SS, which was a very serious matter in wartime, and the film glosses over this entirely. Instead, Harrer is made to appear an unjustly imprisoned man, which is very far from the truth. Few viewers of this film can possibly be expected to know of the Nazi obsession with Tibet or the reasons for it. Nor is the depiction of Tibetan Buddhism as a wholly good institution accurate. The true facts are very different. There were thousands of monasteries in Tibet and some contained 'good guys' and some contained 'bad guys', to put it in its simplest terms. There were sects of Tibetan monks, doubtless a small minority, who were 'on the left hand path' and involved in black magic. They were sometimes called 'the Yellow Hats' by the Nazis. People like the Dalai Lama, who hate things like black magic and believe in love and gentleness, were strongly opposed to them. In other words, Tibetan Buddhism was anything but uniform, it was diverse. Hundreds of 'Yellow Hat' lamas went to Germany during the 1930s and 1940s, and three hundred of them committed ritual suicide in Berlin just as the Russians were invading the City at the end of the War, and their bodies were found all lying in rows not far from Hitler's bunker. These 'evil lamas' were in league with Hitler, and were controlled through the SS, of which Harrer was a member. It was their 'job' to use their spiritual black magic powers to help the Nazis win the War, and Hitler became annoyed with them at the end because he believed they had failed him and that their mystical powers had been ineffective. The Nazis believed all kinds of crazy things, and the SS was the occult core of the Nazi movement, with its head, Heinrich Himmler, being totally obsessed by such matters, including his Tibetan lamas. Among the bizarre beliefs of the Nazis was that there were 'secret chiefs', hidden spirits of gigantic, super-human size, in command of the dark forces, who resided in deep caves beneath the Himalayas. The Nazis sent various expeditions to Tibet in the 1930s, and some of them were received in Lhasa, or at other places which were friendlier than Lhasa. So it seems that Harrer was somewhat less than candid in what he revealed about this, and that the film in turn is even more obfuscating on the issue. Probably it is true that Harrer really did reject his Nazi past after his years in Tibet, but although admitting to a Nazi past to a certain extent, there was no advantage to him, and indeed there was considerable personal danger, in giving any fuller details. After all, his former colleagues would certainly have taken reprisals against him if he had told the true full story about SS penetration of Tibet. It was acknowledged at the top of the Nazi leadership by such occult fanatics as Himmler and Hess that Hitler was being inspired, perhaps even manipulated, by the primaeval 'dark powers' who resided beneath the mountains of Tibet and who would grant the Nazis dominion over the whole earth if they received enough blood sacrifices. The real reason why millions of people were killed in the gas chambers, by no means all of whom were Jews, was not a simplistic anti-Semitism at all (though that was put about for mass consumption, and the anti-Semitism was real enough), but was as a black magic 'blood sacrifice' to the 'dark powers' in Tibet. Hitler and Himmler believed that if they fed the evil spirits inhabiting the caverns beneath Tibet with the souls of millions of humans, the evil spirits would then grant them rule over the earth as their representatives, and at the same time they would be 'making a New Man' of pure Aryan blood. The SS leadership celebrated black masses and many strange sexual rituals and performed human sacrifices. Himmler was the Grand Master and he and his twelve chief subordinate initiates actually worshiped Satan at Schloss Wewelsburg. Concealing the truth about Harrer's original SS membership does no one any good. Indeed, the contrast between Harrer's true SS past, as opposed to the sanitized version of it which says he was merely a Nazi sympathizer, and his later attitudes does him far more credit than he has ever received. Maybe we should look at it that way, and not be too starry-eyed about Germans in Tibet in the 1930s.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Long journey,"I had no idea there was at least one other movie about this (from 1959) - I usually try to watch the original movies of something before I watch a Remake or reimagination. Having said that, since this is a real life story ... maybe it is ok to just go for this one. With an exceptional Brad Pitt, who does not get enough credit for his acting abilities ... which might coincide with him being an treat when it comes to his looks.Usually woman are reduced to the way they look, but I think we can agree that Brad Pitt and his status as sex symbol are also well documented. But this was more to show off his acting abilities. And how he could transform himself - by learning an accent. I mean he is blond and all, so why not be an Austrian, right? But he is just a spectator - even if he has trouble leaving his wife behind - promising her a swift return .. well I don't have to tell you how that works out.The movie shows real people, but amidst all the drama, there is quite a lot of action too. I did not expect this from this movie. But it was quite welcome ... even if it was horrible acts in reality of course. So not condoning any of that. But saying that it brings some well needed context and heightens the drama even more in this. You may feel inclined to check all the things that really happened after watching the movie, which of course is a good thing.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Passable - Good Scenery,"This biographical movie is about real-life Austrian (and Nazi) mountaineer Heinrich Harrar (Pitt) who is unfortunately scaling peaks in British India when WWII breaks out in 1939.  Interred in a British POW camp he and his climbing companion (Thewlis) eventually escape and commence a tortuous travail through India into Tibet and all the way to the forbidden city of Lhasa.  There the two men make friends, including the young Dali Lama, and find enlightenment.The best thing about Seven Years in Tibet is the breathtaking high mountain scenery.  How disappointing to learn the movie was shot in the Andes and not the Himalayas.  The story is also compelling following Harrar as he morphs from selfish pig to generally nice guy.  Unfortunately it's sometimes awkwardly told, and is over-long.  And finally the use of English language dialogue as variously English, German, and Tibetan was as off-putting as Pitt's on-again, off-again German accent.All in all a very ok film, not rip-off from the dollar bin.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Reaching the Summit of Human Conscience and Consciousness,"This is a panoramic film exploring the wilderness of Tibet through the consciousness of an arrogant Austrian climber (Brat Pitt). As Pitt challenges Nanga Parbet, the ninth highest mountain in the world and one of the hardest to climb, the political chaos of late 1930's and 1940's, and his own demons, the nature of mankind is revealed as layers of civilization are peeled to reveal an inner self paradoxically more powerful and yet more vulnerable to the ebb and flow of inhumanity. His own philosophical journey is a reflection of political machinations of the time, the ontogeny recapitulating phylogenetic change of western civilization resulting in a complex modern world forever coiled for violence and warfare.This film has a European pace unsuitable for those addicted to action figure movies with huge budgets and high body counts. I recommend it as a ""good view"" similar to a good read.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good film but Brad Pitt miscast,"Some really lovely scenes in this film and given the information online about true events, seems to depict them fairly well.As a European, for me, Brad Pitt was terribly miscast. Too pouty, crap accent, too Hollywood. Floppy blond hair, which features in so many other of his films, definitely doesn't work.When making films like this, which carry such weight, why oh why not cast actors from the countries the characters are from?! They are not in short supply.Honestly, I couldn't see past Brad Pitt in this film. Pretty surprised that so many people have raved about his performance. Not quite Seven!!!",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Has a bit of heart and worth a watch,"This movie is about a journey of a arrogant and selfish man named Heinrich Harrer(Brad Pitt) and after he is taken captive as a prisoner of war. And how he finds peace and compassion within himself. The beginning is fast paced and not developed enough, which is fine for a movie that has a long story to tell as this one. But it just wasn't engaging or got my interest, even if it's because it's to get Heinrich Harrer's character down. There is a long waiting period before Heinrich Harrer makes it to Tibet and than it's when the movie kick off and becomes heartfelt and touching. Brad Pitt was close to his prime when this movie came out and when it comes to appearance wise he has the charisma to carry the movie. His acting was decent but his Austrian accent just seemed way too forced in this. Sometimes I get used to actors or actresses fake accents but not this time around. The love triangle part of this movie bring out Heinrich's character but what makes this movie emotionally moving. Is Heinrich's relationship with Dalai Lama in Tibet. In fact this movie made me feel for the Tibetan people who are these really peaceful people that thinks of there ""enemy as there greatest teacher...Because only an enemy can help develop patience and compassion."" And especially felt for the Tibetan people when they started to get suppressed by the Chinese army. Although this movie doesn't entirely grab at the heartstrings it does have a bit of heart to it and is worth a watch. It isn't a great film but it's a good one.7.4/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sweeping and big-budgeted epic based on real memories of the mountaineer Heinrich Harrer,"Interesting and colorful film about an ace , cold-hearted climber called Heinrich Harrer : Brad Pitt, after the death some mountaineers decides to add patriotism and glory to his Austrian country by climbing Narga Parbat peak . As Harrer goes to British india and after Tíbet, leaving his pregnant wife in Austria . But in India Harrer is taken prisoner and he becomes a WWII POW at a British internment camp . When Harrer and his colleague Peter : David Thewlis, get away , they travel across India to Tíbet where Harrer bonds with and becomes a preceptor to young Dalai Lama in Lasha at time of China's takeover of the Buddist country . At the end of the World his real journey began.This is a pretty good movie developed with great intelligence , high sensitivity and spectacular vistas , though hampered by being extremely overlong and unfocused as well as sluggish narrative , which attempts to cover too many subplots . Based on a self-biographic book by Heinrich Harrer himself and enjoyable screenplay by Becky Johnson. However , the script hides the Nazi past of Harrer and his ties with the party . Brad Pitt as the mountaineer who attempts to take a crack at the peak of Nanga Parbat gives an attractive acting , though forceful , at times . And other actors provide capable interpretations, such as : David Thewlis as his escaped pal and a lot of Oriental players as Victor Wong as Chinese Amban , Mako as a Tíbet minister , B.D. Wong as an adviser , Jamyang as 14-year-old Dalai Lama and several others .It contains a brilliant and sunny cinematography with plenty of snow-capped mountain scenary and breathtaking sightseeing. Being wonderfully photographed by cameraman Robert Fraisse , though due to Chinese problems and India's refusal to allow shooting , filmmaker Annaud wound up substituting the Himalayas for the Argentine Andes . While the incombustible musician John Williams , Steven Spielberg's regular, composes another great magnificent score in his usual evocative style . The picture was compellingly produced and directed by Jean Jacques Annaud . This is a good French filmmaker who has got a lot of hits and a few flops . As he directed ""Quest of fire ,"" Hothead"" , ""Victory in Chantant"" , ""The Bear"" , ""The Lover"" , ""The Name of the Rose"" ,"" Enemy at the Gates"" , ""Two Brothers"" , among others. Rating 7/10 . Better than average . The flick will appeal to Brad Pitt fans . Well worth watching .",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Hats off to Robert Fraisse (director of photography)Dear Rolf Harrer: I'm a person you don't know, a man you've never met. But you are someone who occupies my mind, and my heart, in this distant land where I have gone. If you can imagine a hidden place tucked safely away from the world concealed by walls of high, snowcapped mountains, a place rich with all the strange beauty of your nighttime dreams, then you know where I am. In the country where I am traveling, Tibet, people believe if they walk long distances to holy places it purifies the bad deeds they've committed. They believe the more difficult the journey the greater the depth of purification. I've been walking from one faraway place to the next for many years. As long as you have lived. I have seen seasons change across the high plateaus. I have seen wild kiangs migrate south in winter and sweep back across the fields when spring appears. In this place, where time stands still, it seems that everything is moving including me. I can't say I know where I'm going, nor whether my bad deeds can be purified. There are so many things I have done which I regret. But when I come to a full stop, I hope you will understand that the distance between us is not as great as it seems. With deep affection your father, Heinrich Harrer.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Cinematography is absolutely brilliant,"This movie has some of the best cinematography I have ever seen. The movie does a great job of showing the Potala Palace and Jokhang Temple in Lhasa as well as the rural villages of Tibet. Not to mention the breath taking views of the Himalayas.Yes, Brad Pitt's accent wasn't exactly his best but it's forgivable when watching the movie. His acting was superb, portraying Heinrich's transition, which is what the movie is all about.The movie did lack qualities of the book, the ending was totally wrong and somewhat disappointing. And the whole Nazi part in Austria was completely unnecessary.Besides a few minor details, the movie is well worth the 2 1/2 hours especially if you are interested in the Chinese seizure of Tibet and the Tibetan culture and people.(Free Tibet!)",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Twelve years in the Tibet area, 1939-1951","""Seven Years in Tibet"" (1997) is a biographical historical drama about Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer (Brad Pitt) and his time in Tibet and friendship with the Dalai Lama, a boy, just before & during WW2, as well as the build-up to the invasion of Tibet in 1950 by Communist Chinese forces and the immediate aftermath. David Thewlis is on hand as Heinrich's German mountaineer friend.The movie's similar to other realistic walk-to-salvation wilderness adventures, like ""The Way Back"" (2010). Pitt is charismatic as the pompous mountaineer who is slowly humbled in the highest region of the globe. The movie couldn't be made today since it paints the Chinese Communist Party in a negative light; in other words, it's truthful.The film runs 2 hours, 16 minutes and the bulk of it was shot in Argentina at the city of La Plata and the Andes Mountains in the Mendoza Province, while about 20 minutes of footage was secretly shot in Tibet.GRADE: B",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fabulous Movie,"It's superbly-shot. Some stella casting. The clothes are gorgeous and locations are perfect. It's an early Brad Pitt movie and the guy just oozes movie star.However he can't do an Austrian accent. Why they didn't get him to do accent training I have no idea.Listen to Arnie S's thick Austrian accent and compare. It's the real bug bear of the movie for me tbh.Otherwise the authenticity of the peripheral is perfect, especially the pow camps and the holy palace.The book is clearly very special. I've not read it but I have read about Tibetan culture and I am hugely emphatic to its people, their struggle and the poor international response against the might of the Chinese army and communist government.It's a tragedy and a sin that the Chinese did what they did without ever facing consequences.I love how a big-budget movie can honestly depict the plight of indigenous people. Hopefully people will be aware and protective of the Tibetan people and their legacy and peaceful outlook on life.I'm glad that I watched the movie. It's aged incredibly well. Fabulous cinema and the long tracking pull-back shot of the mountain at the end is a delight.Fabulous stuff. Long live Tibet!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Memorable Movie,"It is Brad Pitt movie; so expect some class. And there it is.Directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud, ""Seven Years in Tibet"" is a biographical drama film based on the book of the same name by Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer.The movie stars Brad Pitt as Harrer, a selfish and arrogant adventurer who embarks on a dangerous journey to climb the Himalayan Mountain range, only to be captured and imprisoned by the British during World War II. After a daring escape, he along with another prisoner reaches Tibet where they meet the young14th Dalai Lama, the spiritual and political leader of Tibet. Harrer becomes a tutor to the Dalai Lama and learns about Tibetan culture and Buddhism. He also witnesses the Chinese invasion of Tibet Dalai LamaThe film is a captivating portrayal of Harrer's transformation from an egocentric climber to a compassionate human being, and the portrayal of the Dalai Lama's struggle to maintain peace and non-violence in the face of heavy odds is inspiring. The breath-taking scenery and stunning cinematography of the Himalayas and Tibet add to the movie's mesmerizing beauty.Brad Pitt's performance as Heinrich Harrer is commendable, as he convincingly portrays the character's transformation from a selfish adventurer to a man who learns to appreciate the culture and people of Tibet. David Thewlis also delivers a strong performance as Harrer's fellow prisoner, Peter Aufschnaiter, who accompanies him on his journey to Tibet and becomes his close friend.The film explores the personal growth and transformation of Heinrich Harrer, who starts as an arrogant and self-centred adventurer, but through his experiences in Tibet, he learns to appreciate the culture and people of Tibet and develops a deep respect for the Dalai Lama and his teachings. The movie highlights the clash between Western culture and Tibetan culture, as Harrer and Aufschnaiter struggle to adapt to the unfamiliar customs and beliefs of the Tibetan people. The film also focuses on the strong bond of friendship that develops between Harrer and Aufschnaiter, as they support each other through their struggles and adventures in Tibet.There are many interesting episodes in ""Seven Years in Tibet,"" but here are a few examples:Harrer's escape from the British prison camp: After being captured by the British during his attempt to climb Nanga Parbat, Harrer and his friend Peter Aufschnaiter manage to escape from the prison camp by scaling a steep cliff. This scene is both thrilling and suspenseful, as the two men use their climbing skills to evade their captors.Harrer's arrival in Lhasa: After several years of living in Tibet, Harrer finally arrives in Lhasa, the capital city of Tibet. This scene is beautifully shot, as Harrer is mesmerized by the stunning architecture and vibrant colors of the city, and the audience is given a glimpse into the unique culture and customs of Tibet.Throughout the film, Harrer's character undergoes a profound spiritual transformation, as he learns to embrace the teachings of Buddhism and develop a deep respect for the Tibetan people. The scene where he meditates with the Dalai Lama and discovers inner peace is a powerful and moving moment that highlights the film's themes of personal growth and enlightenment.Overall, ""Seven Years in Tibet"" is a beautifully crafted and thought-provoking film that offers a fascinating insight into Tibetan culture and history, as well as an inspiring story of personal growth and spiritual awakening. It is a must-watch for anyone interested in history, culture, and human relationships.Tail piece

Insane Intolerance,"While it take some time to get moving, this is a truly captivating film. It's about redemption and pain. It's about true events which cast the Tibetan culture against the Chinese's land grab. We have the Buddhists on the one hand, and the godless hordes on the other. The die is cast and all we can do is watch. This is a movie about a selfish character and his comrade who find respite in the Himalaya's in the temple of the Dalai Lama. The gentleness and trust of the people is betrayed by one of them but it really wouldn't have mattered. There is a nice relationship developed between the young Lama and Brad Pitt's selfish, pig headed Westerner. Apparently there are elements of truth to this story. One feels so helpless in a world like this with so little one can do. It finally gets to what the Buddhists preach. Absolute dedication to their beliefs down to the last person.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Seven Years in Tibet - Similar to Kundun,"I happened, purely by chance, to see Kundun and Seven Years in Tibet on the same day recently. They are both very fine motion pictures which have similar characters and events, but at the same time, they are both very different.The Scorsese version made years earlier focuses on Tibet from the top down, while the Annaud version focuses on Tibet from the bottom up. By that, I mean the common people are portrayed very differently in both versions. In the Scorsese version, the common TIbetans are generally faceless and anonymous, but in the Annaud version, they have vibrant personalities and individual traits.Oddly enough, the Dalai Lama is portrayed in a very similar fashion in both films. However, in the Scorsese version, the Dali Lama is almost exclusively in the company of his chief officials, whereas in the Annaud version, the Dali Lama spends an inordinate amount of time with a foreigner.I found the Scorsese version to be more believable for this characterization. Brad Pitt does an admirable job, as do the rest of the cast. In the Scorsese version, the Dali Lama is the central figure, but Brad Pitt is the central figure in Seven Years in Tibet.The treatment of the Chinese in both films differs as well. Scorsese is nowhere nearly as harsh on the Chinese as is Annaud, who shows the Chinese invaders in a far darker light. Also, in my opinion, this is Brad Pitt's finest performance; and it is a shame he did not get the Oscar for his work.I can heartily recommend both versions of the tales of Tibet and the Dali Lama to all audiences; they are both enlightening.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Very good...,"""Seven Years in Tibet"" is a Biography - Drama movie based on the real-life experiences of Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer during his time in Tibet. We follow his journey from a self-centered man to someone deeply impacted by the culture and people of Tibet, particularly his friendship with the young Dalai Lama.I liked this movie because it was interesting and visually stunning, with breathtaking shots of the Himalayan landscape and the vibrant Tibetan culture. The interpretation of Brad Pitt who played as Heinrich Harrer was amazing presenting very well the change of his character from arrogance to humility. While his relationship with Dalai Lama was heartwarming and acted as the emotional core of the movie. All in all, I have to say that ""Seven Years in Tibet"" is a beautiful and interesting movie of personal growth and cultural exchange so, I strongly recommend you to watch it.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Good, could be shorter","Movie is very good, strong story, good actors. But it ciuld be 20 mims shorter. Too much war focused. First half of the movie was better.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Too long but still worth it,"The main problem with this film, and indeed with many films set in the outdoors, is that it's too long.  Maybe it's because I'm a product of the city and the suburbs, but to me, most movies set in the outdoors that don't use the scenery to advance the plot or set the mood, but rather just want to gaze at it, bore me quickly.  It's like, ""Yes, it's beautiful, let's move on.""  Also, though I like Brad Pitt, he doesn't always do the job with his Austrian accent; even when he gets it down, you're always thinking, ""That's Brad Pitt doing an Austrian accent,"" rather than, ""That's Heinrich Harrer."" And that whole subplot about Harrer missing the son he's never seen doesn't work.Still, there is much to like in this film.  In many of these ""white men in strange country"" movies, the emphasis is on what the white man teaches the people in the other country, and that's somewhat condescending; here, it's on what the people in the other country teach Harrer, yet his story isn't made more important than the story of the Tibet people.  Also, though his accent doesn't convince, Pitt is convincing as Harrer in the physical sense; he looks like a former skier and like the blond, blue-eyed ideal of the Nazis.  And finally, he's convincing in taking us through Harrer's transformation.Two more things; one, someone in their comments wondered how the Dalai Lama knew so much about Western culture.  According to the book, Harrer found the Dalai Lama to be quite curious about the world around him, so he studied what he could.  Also, the film meets head-on the controversy about Harrer being a former Nazi; it doesn't soft-pedal his past at all, which makes his transformation that much more convincing.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Another good movie from Jean-Jacques Annaud.,"Seven Years In Tibet is despite its length never boring. It's entertaining and for a biography it's an interesting story. Not sure why they took Brad Pitt to play Heinrich Harrer, in my opinion they should have taken a real Austrian or German actor. I agree that Brad Pitt's German accent wasn't good at all. Nothing wrong with his acting though but his accent wasn't on top. David Thewlis also did a good job playing his character. The story is certainly worth to be told, what China did to the Tibetian people is scandalous and should not be forgotten. They should have mentioned that Harrer was a SS Nazi though, I wonder why they left such an important detail out of the movie. The cinematography was good and even if most of the movie was filmed in Argentina it could easily pass for Tibet. Jean-Jacques Annaud did it again. After The Name Of The Rose, L'ours and La Guerre Du Feu it's another hit from him. Seven Years in Tibet will please a lot of people, hence the high score.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Simply bad,"This is a really bad piece of disinformation and propaganda. Harrer is depicted as ant-Nazi, while in his real life he was very proud of the honors he received from Hitler and the photos where he appears with the Nazi boss. As a matter of fact he did not leave Tibet until 1950. Why did he remain there? Was he acting as an ""adviser"" for some Western power? Was he scared of going back to Austria and being summoned by an anti-Nazi courtroom? Or was he even more afraid to fall in the hands of Chinese judges? After all, he was a Nazi, allied with the Japanese, who had invaded China and killed thousands and thousands of innocent Chinese people. And Aufschnaiter? Did he really remain in the Himalayan areas because he had ""married a Tibetan woman""? Or was he similarly afraid to go back to the West? After all, he had joined the Nazi Party in 1933. And so on.

"Great for raising awareness for Tibet, but problematic Orientalist narratives","While this movie is both heartwarming and heartbreaking, has a few great scenes that will make you laugh, and shares a powerful message, its delivery was hindered by its painfully white perspective. The infantilization of Asia and all-knowing Western male figure make up an example out of an Orientalism textbook. Perhaps bringing Brad Pitt into this movie was the only way to attract Western audiences to this political subject, but I still believe the idealization of white foreignness in Asia and cringey depictions of cross-cultural interaction were highly problematic aspects of this film.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Remarkably unlike the book,"There is a theory that if choosing between a book and a movie made from that book one should see the movie first because if the book is read first the movie is bound to be a letdown. While there are rare exceptions to this adage (""The Green Mile"" e.g.) none is more true than ""Seven Years in Tibet."" Brad Pitt shows his acting chops, but the departures from the story of the book will cause hand wringing in the unsuspecting viewer.In the actual story: (Note SPOILERS ahead): -Harrer was not married, had no child to write to, no wife to leave behind and seek a reunion with. -Harrer was not particularly arrogant a person or in conflict with his fellow mountaineers before their capture. He seemed to be apolitical despite recent revelations of Nazi membership and simply self-absorbed. Thus, he did not need the ""redemption"" of his personality that the movie depicts. -There was no beautiful woman competing for the affections of the two Westerners. Aufschnaiter apparently never married, or if he did, Harrer made no mention of it and told of his own lack of inclination to form relationships with women there. -There was no palace intrigue related to the Chinese invasion. -The Dalai Lama appears only peripherally until near the end of the story. Although he and Harrer clearly bonded, this bond was described at the end of the book and did not form the basis for Harrer's immersion into Tibetan culture.One could ask what Harrer himself, in hindsight, thought of Germany's treatment of foreigners, particularly in view of the way the British treated him despite his many escape attempts (""sporting""); what he felt at the defeat of Naziism; how he might compare his feelings about Chinese aggression with his feelings about Germany's policies; what he sees of Germany's position in the post-war world, such as its democratic government and its United Nations roles in the Tibetan issues of Chinese occupation. None of this is mentioned in the book or its Epilog, though sufficient time has passed that a coda to the movie would have been possible and valuable.The move seems to have taken the title and run with it, but the story was left behind. Nice scenery, though.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Stunning scenery with a long drawn plot,"A dreadful reminder of the plight of the Tibetan people too often forgotten beneath the troubles of other oppressed peoples.Slow to start it takes over an hour before the main narrative starts to emerge.

I´ve never doubted it untill I moved abroad.I don´t think the latter part of the movie is demonising the communist party. Even I know that our party don´t appreciate things that are either too spiritual or too aethestical. They like pragmatic things. Although, it pains me to see how they destroyed the temples, the paitings and their time-honored religious traditions. It pains me to know that Dalai had to scape to India, like what was said in the movie.Ok, sentimental comments about Chinese history apart, the movie presents a very smooth story line and character transition, from a egoist loner to a wise man, still alone.

Brad Pitt does seem to have a way with septets,"Having starred in ""Se7en"", Brad Pitt then starred in another 7: ""Seven Years in Tibet"", about Austrian explorer Heinrich Harrer. Before this movie came out, I had never heard of Harrer, and the movie does a very good job telling his story. It shows how he started out working with the Nazis to try and take over parts of South Asia, but then befriended the Dalai Lama and had a change of heart. So, even though Brad Pitt's Teutonic accent isn't the most believable, the movie does a good job showing how a person can change. The cinematography almost is a character all on its own, with the Tibetan landscape. A very awe-inspiring movie. Also starring David Thewlis, B.D.

"Great cinematography, otherwise mostly disappointing","Maybe it's that fact that I have read the book 3 times, but having read other books and seen the corresponding films this one was particularly bad. It starts with the main character, Heinrich Harrer, played by Brad Pitt. I'd have expected much more of a world class actor. He doesn't behave like an alpinist, nor does he resemble an Austrian in general. However, in defence of Pitt, the screenplay is probably the worst bit of this film and as such probably a difficult task for any actor. When Harrer was invited to the premiere of the film, he mostly praised it, but only because he was a polite and humble man - much to the contrary what Becky Johnston (the screenplay author) made of him. She quite obviously had no idea about alpinism and didn't research Harrer's life. She doesn't even seem to have understood the book itself. The real book certainly wasn't about a lost son (Rolf) or a lost marriage, nor was it about any rivalry between alpinists (Aufschnaiter - Harrer). Harrer and Aufschnaiter survived a physically and mentally extremely exhausting escape over the Himalayas under deadly conditions with very limited gear where most of us probably would have died many times. The endurance of this incredible achievement is totally lost in the film. In Lhasa, it was mostly his awestruck confrontation with a hidden culture, which was quite contrary to the film or simply didn't get through to the audience. Anyone who has seen Werner Herzog's ""Rescue Dawn"", would agree that an escape story can be done much better with a much lower budget.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
AN OUTRAGEOUS DISTORTION OF HISTORY,"First of all, Heinrich Harrer was a Nazi.Secondly, Harrer was in Tibet in the first place because he was fleeing from his responsibilities to his family. The man was a complete and total opportunist.Thirdly, the cutesy little Dalai Lama spouting kitsch philosophy like some Tibetan Kahlil Gibran is absolutely untrue to life. There is no record whatsoever of the little Dalai preaching generalities to Harrer.Fourthly, all observers (including the Dalai Lama himself--see his autobiography) agree that the arriving Chinese were not at all the studiously rude boors depicted in the film, ordering Tibetans around with scowls on their faces and going out of their way to disrespect Tibetan customs. Even Hitler would have been polite on such an occasion, if only for the sake of his dignity.Fifthly, the Chinese did NOT make a diplomatic visit to Lhasa prior to the 1951 invasion, as depicted in this ridiculous film, and if they had done so, they certainly wouldn't have been stupid enough to trust the Tibetans to build them an airplane landing field, since the Tibetans had no experience with aviation. Nor, in all probability, would a Chinese plane have been lucky enough to have landed safely on a field constructed by Tibetans. Nor would the Chinese, having made it there by some miracle, have departed after a five-minute conference with their Tibetan opposite numbers.Sixthly, Brad Pitt gives the impression that this is his first attempt at acting. He's pathetic.The cause of Tibetan autonomy is not served by a film which creates a fantasy and invites viewers to confuse it with historical reality.This is a pretty film to look at, but worthless as drama or as a depiction of history.",,Anonymous,Biography

"I thought it would be absolute pants, but it wasn't.","OK, Seven Years in Tibet. It sounds like its going to be a bit of a four hour epic and you get a bit aprehensive before you start, but honestly there is no need to at all.Brad Pitt, our lead for the film, is an Austrian climber and a member of the pre-ww2 nazi party. He is married and has a child due in less than a month, so what does he do he runs off to climb a mountain. Thats obviously what you'd want to do.His character is absolutely arrogant and you don't like him at all. The film then centres upon this and shows us how he develops with time and the factors that influence this change. His son is born without him present and due to the lack of love he expresses to his wife she divorces him. Pitt is then arrested at the start of the war and breaks free from a prison camp and final stumbles into Tibet and the sacred city. Well we don't want to give it all away, so I'll stop all that plot development stuff right there.The big stunts, high adrenalin action is not there in this film at all. But it doesn't suffer at all as a  result. To me this film is all about the script and the characters in them. Pitts performance is brilliant, the best that he has ever given. There is nothing that you don't believe about the way he portrays his character. The way he develops it throughout the film is great to watch.

Very interesting story solidly told,There is no doubt this is a fascinating story and one that shows both the best and worse of the human race. Brad Pitt does well as the min character although the accent takes a bit of getting used to. Overall this is solidly made with some good acting from the supporting cast. For me the pacing is a little bit off with the intro before Pitt gets to Tibet and the Dalai Lama to long and serving no real purpose. The telling of the story between Harrer and the Dalai Lama is well developed and sympathetic and it is easily the strongest part of the movie.

Surprisingly Disappointing,"I like Brad Pitt as an actor so it is difficult to believe it took me this long to finally see this.movie.

Seven Year Itch,"Thrown into a prisoner-of-war camp at the outbreak of World War II, an Austrian mountain climber escapes and eventually finds a new purpose in life as a mentor to the Dalai Lama in this historical drama based on actual events. Brad Pitt has some excellent, quiet moments as the conflicted main character who gradually progresses from arrogant and resentful to humble and compassionate, however, his attempt at an Austrain accent makes it a hard performance to sit through whenever he opens his mouth. There is, however, a lot to like about Pitt's character and the way he comes to see the Dalai Lama (still a boy upon meeting him) as a surrogate son. The friendship and camaraderie between the pair is very sweet and easily the highlight of the film with the Dalai Lama's intelligent questions and Pitt's thoughtful responses. The two do not meet until around halfway in though, and amusing as David Thewlis often is as a fellow POW who escapes with Pitt, the first half the film does not quite have the zest of the second half. This is a technically well accomplished movie either way though with the atmospheric Golden Globe nominated music of John Williams and all the majestic, vast natural landscapes rendering the tale quite immersive. It is hard not to wonder what may have been though with a more compact run-time - and no fake accent.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Okay, last take, say 'Himalayas'.","Seven years in Tibet throws one mans Non secular ambitions and achievements against a culture that sees no use for them. Set in an intriguing snippet of Tibet's history, World War 2 halts our main character at every turn (played by Brad Pitt). Heinrich Harrer's goals slowly change as he begins to discover more about himself and mellow from an unwelcome, rather bullish foreigner, to a man of local respect. against the stunning backdrop of the Incredible Himalayas, the scenery really puts you straight into a world of religious seclusion and peace. With many twists and turns, the story of Seven years in Tibet keeps you glued in as an epic adventure, that rightly required a film, unfolds before you.Occasionally the mystique of the film is somewhat broken by Brad Pitt's unusual attempt at a Austrian accent, and I feel at a run time of over 2 hours, in sections it feels like it can drag. However I can forgive that of a film that documents 7 years of a very patient, very lost man.Seven years in Tibet enamors with a fascinating culture, gets you lost in spectacular landscapes, and weaves you in to an excellent story. It is a film I will not readily forget for it's character development, periods of tension and story and is certainly well worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Nice little piece of fiction,"Seven Years in Tibet is loosely based on real events. More specifically, on the live of Heinrich Harrer, played here by Brad Pitt, who got captured in India during World War Two, escaped and fled to Tibet, where he became acquainted with the young Dalai Lama.Very interesting stuff and one of those fine examples of reality sometimes being more interesting than anything fiction can offer. That being said, apparently the minutiae of this film is largely made up. The large strokes are correct, but the film makers have added in a lot of details, characters and events that never happened or existed. Which is a bit of a shame, because the real life events would have been interesting on their own, but then again, it's a movie. I never expect them to be 100 percent accurate.And what we do get is pretty nice. It's not the most riveting historical drama I've ever seen, but it has good actors, gorgeous locations and great music. Plus it sheds light on a time and place rarely seen in film.Although I must say that the film criminally underutilizes its David Thewlis. But that's just my personal bias.Seven Years in Tibet is a good watch if you're a fan of historical dramas. Especially if they take place in faraway land and culture. Just don't go in expecting anything resembling accuracy when it comes to historical facts.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Himalayas are the star,"It's a great real life story. The Himalayas provide a fantastic backdrop. So why did it seem so slow and boring? I like Brad Pitt, but he is hopelessly mis-cast here. Way too much flicking off his blond fringe and moody looks. He provides a very poor faux Austrian accent. Even David Thewlis (soon to be a convincing German in The Striped Pyjamas) seemed to struggle with it. The Pitt character was totally unlovable. Quite why the young Dalai Lama took such a shine to him is never really explained. Ever wondered why China is reluctant to be critical of the Russian invasion of Ukraine? Well - this film goes some way to explaining it.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A true story about a living deity,"This spectacular film set in the main in Tibet begins in Austria just before the start of the second world war. 7 Years in Tibet is a memorable if not riveting movie of a living deity which transforms the belief of the watcher. The wonderful background drops and scenery and equally dramatic music are superb as the story follows the progress of Heinrich Harrer (still living today) and his relationship with the current Dalai Lama, as a young boy. The peaks of the Himalayas and in particular Nanga Parbat never understates the achievement of this fine film. The Lhasa set is convincing and the spirituality felt throughout the film crescendos to a moving close. You are left with the feeling that you must know more and that wisdom transcends all. Watch it and watch it again and again.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A little too long,"There's an attempt here to capture the symbolism of the child as the spiritual leader of humankind. After all, the child is older than the adult by a generation and therefore, evolutionarily speaking, the adult's elder. The idea that a child might be wiser than the adult is plausible since the child is not yet corrupted by the prejudices and delusions of the current society, and may see things more clearly than we can. If I had made this film, I would have worked on those ideas. Still I doubt success since what is really necessary is an illumination of Tibetan Buddhism, which is beyond the reach of a general audience.What Jean-Jacques Annaud does is keep the camera on his star, Brad Pitt, and hope Pitt's charisma will carry the film. It does not, although Pitt does a commendable job, his accent fading in and out notwithstanding. It's just that without any real tension in the story, the film is just a picturesque travelogue, and not a very good one at that. There is no attempt to come to grips with Tibetan society nor with the issues surrounding the Communist aggression. Annaud does work hard on the relationship between Harra and the Dalai Lama, achieving unfortunately a sort of Western mid-brow comprehension. I was going to say news magazine comprehension, but it doesn't even reach that. Harra shows the kid how to work gadgets and trades some superficial knowledge of the world while learning humility and social responsibility. The unavoidable irony that Harra plays the father to the Dalai Lama instead of his own son was agreeable although acted out with entirely too much familiarity. Worse fault though is to just present the child as the Dalai Lama without attempting to show why a child is chosen in the first place. Just to illustrate how far from the reality of Tibetan Buddhism this film was, let me ask the question, why not a girl?(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

Spirit versus oppression,"The first time I watched this movie, I didn't pay much attention, so I didn't pick up the most important details. Second time I was drawn in and then I could really enjoy this movie. ""Seven years in Tibet"" follows the story of an Austrian alpine star and his life in Tibet. His encounter with Tibet, its culture and people is highlighted very well by the excellent director Annaud and the scenery is incredible.Brad Pitt excels in one of his first solid roles and makes this a worthwhile experience along with David Thewlis, B.D. Wong, Mako, the beautiful Lhakpa Tsamchoe and the young actor playing Dalai Lama. There is humor, drama and tensions here as well as tragedy and political intrigues. Wong is especially effective as the treacherous Ngawang Jigme, the man who becomes the main responsible for his country's fall. This subplot is the most interesting in the film and shows us how traitors have existed and will exist anywhere in the world, even in such a religious and ""pure"" country as Tibet.All in all, it's a very strong experience and enriching one also. Here we see the everlasting battle of the spirit against oppression, but in contrast to other such movies, this one has a more pessimistic ending. Oppression triumphs. This is clearly one of the most important movies of the last decade.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Lizzen, I haf a gret idea for zis movie!","OK, here it is: ""Nazi mountaineer befriends the Dalai Lama.""  What we do is, first we get a major star with no idea whatsoever how to do a Germanic accent, and we let him flounder around between French, German, American, and British for over 2 hours.  Then we concoct a series of wildly improbable events and space them apart very widely, so that the plot inches along almost imperceptibly.  But just to make sure the viewer doesn´t fall asleep, we throw in details which are shockingly absurd, such as our hero smoking a cigarette at an altitude of 22,000 feet.  Naturally, we must also remember that our target audience does not want to read too many subtitles, so we have every character, even the lowliest peasant in the forbidden closed-off city of Lhasa in 1943, speak perfect English, also with dubious accents. Of course, the trickiest part is how to handle the spiritual and political aspects of the story, so what we do is this: we have the Dalai Lama befriend the now-reformed Nazi because the latter is so good at fiddling with film projectors, radios, antique cars, and any other devices with represent the freedom of the capitalist west.  In return, our hero learns from his young protegé a kind of vague, undefined Buddhism which is never really brought out or treated in a serious fashion.  We also have lots of scenes with the hero flaunting all the marks of respects and protocol which the rest of the Tibetan society accords the Dalai Lama, even as we pretend that the hero has deep and profound reverence for these people and their spiritual leader. In other words, we just expect the audience to believe that this guy is now a Buddhist, sort of, in his own way, even though we ourselves don´t seem to know what his transformation entails or how far we want it to go.  And last but not least, we hang a statistic onto the end of the film about how appallingly the Chinese have treated the Tibetans (which is certainly true), thus opening ourselves up to charges that we have made a ""political"" movie, even though it is nothing of the sort.  So, zat ist my idea.  Vat do you zink?  Can ve make zis movie?",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
S7n,"7 years in Tibet is based on a true story about a man named Heinrich Harrer who is on a trip in the Himalayan mountains. He is an Austrian mountaineer. It all happens at the beginning of world war 2 (1939). The group gets arrested by Indian forces and put in a prisoner of war camp. In 1944 he escapes together with his friend Peter Aufschnaiter. They had to cross 65 Himalayan passes and survive the altitude and cold weather before they came to Lhasa (Capital of Tibet). He becomes a trusted person by the Dalai Lama. In 1950 the Chinese army invaded Tibet and the Dalai Lama has to flee. So does Heinrich Harrer. His years in Tibet have been described in the book 7 years in Tibet which has also been made into a movie. Whilst he lived in Tibet he was active in many projects that benefited the Tibetan people (build a dam, created a map of Lhasa, designed stamps, and became an advisor to the Dalai Lama).The group gets arrested by Indian forces and put in a prisoner of war camp. In 1944 he escapes together with his friend Peter Aufschnaiter by giving them ice skates and telling them that it is to cut meat. By the time that they have the skates on, they can run away.The film was filmed in Argentina, Andes, and Canada but also had to be shot at the Himalayan mountains because then a lot of the special effects would show so that the movie would look super realistic and that people would actually believe it. Heinrich Harrer is ""The main character"". The real story also took place in the Himalayan mountains.A 1997 American biographical war drama film based on the 1952 book of the same name. In one of the sequence Ngawang Jigme leads the Tibetan army at the border town of Chamdo to halt the advancing People's Liberation Army. However, he ends up surrendering and blows up the Tibetan ammunition dump after the one-sided Battle of Chamdo.During the treaty signing, Kungo Tsarong tells Harrer that if Jigme had not destroyed the weapons supply, the Tibetan guerrillas could have held the mountain passes for months or even years; long enough to appeal to other nations for help. He also states that, for Tibetans, capitulation is like a death sentence. As the Chinese occupy Tibet, Harrer condemns Ngawang Jigme for betraying his country, declaring their friendship over. Out of anger, Harrer further humiliates the senior official by returning the jacket that Ngawang Jigme gave him as a present, a grave insult in Tibetan culture, as well as by throwing him onto the ground.Many belive and I agree too that Brad Pitt wasn't the perfect fit for the job, he misplaced the character at many instances.Interestingly there is another 1997 film directed by Martin Scorsese called ""Kundan"" a biographical on Dalai Lama. Even before the film was released, China's leaders hotly objected to Disney's plans to distribute the film, even to the point of threatening Disney's future access to China as a market. Disney's steadfastness stood in stark contrast to Universal Pictures, which had earlier ""turned down the chance to distribute Kundun for fear of upsetting the Chinese."" Scorsese, Mathison, and several other members of the production were banned by the Chinese government from ever entering China as a result of making the film. China retaliated by banning Disney films and pulling Disney television cartoons. Disney apologized in 1998 for releasing the film and began to ""undo the damage"", eventually leading to a deal to open Shanghai Disneyland by 2016. Former Disney CEO Michael Eisner has appoligised for offending Communist Chinese sensitivities, calling the film ""a stupid mistake"" and said, ""The bad news is that the film was made; the good news is that nobody watched it. Here I want to apologize, and in the future we should prevent this sort of thing, which insults our friends, from happening.The Central Tibetan Administration is Tibet's elected parliamentary government based in Dharamshala, India. It is also referred to as the Tibetan Government in Exile. It is composed of a judiciary branch, a legislative branch, and an executive branch. Since its formation in 1959, the Central Tibetan Administration has not been officially recognised by China. The Tibetan diaspora and refugees support the Central Tibetan Administration by voting for members of Parliament, the President and by making annual financial contributions through the use of the ""Green Book."" The Central Tibetan Administration also receives international support from organisations and individuals.The Central Tibetan Administration's internal structure is governmental; it has stated that it is ""not designed to take power in Tibet""; rather, it will be dissolved ""as soon as freedom is restored in Tibet"" in favour of a government formed by Tibetans inside Tibet. The Central Tibetan Administration is headquartered in McLeod Ganj, Dharamshala, India. It represents the people of the entire Tibet Autonomous Region and Qinghai province, as well as two Tibetan Autonomous Prefectures and one Tibetan Autonomous County in Sichuan Province, one Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and one Tibetan Autonomous County in Gansu Province and one Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province- all of which is termed ""Historic Tibet"" by the CTA.The CTA attends to the welfare of the Tibetan exile community in India, who number around 100,000. It runs schools, health services, cultural activities and economic development projects for the Tibetan community. More than 1,000 refugees still arrive each year from China, usually via Nepal. The Central Tibetan Authority is not recognised as a sovereign government by any country, but it receives financial aid from governments and international organisations for its welfare work among the Tibetan exile community in India.The movie shows Kalachakra Mandala beautifully. Kalachakra term in Vajrayana Buddhism that means ""wheel of time"" or ""time cycles"". ""Kalacakra"" is also the name of a series of Buddhist texts and a major practice lineage in Indian Buddhism and Tibetan Buddhism. The Klacakratantra contains various ideas about society, the individual's place in society and how they are interrelated. These provide a sociological theory which forms the framework for the Klacakratantra's ideas on history, prophecy and soteriology. The Golden Urn refers to a method introduced by the Qing dynasty of China in the late-18th century to select rinpoches, lamas and other high offices within Tibetan Buddhism. Dharanis also known as a Parittas, are Buddhist chants, mnemonic codes, incantations, or recitations, usually the mantras consisting of Sanskrit or Pali phrases. Believed to be protective and with powers to generate merit for the Buddhist devotee, they constitute a major part of historic Buddhist literature. Many of these chants are in Sanskrit and Pali, written in scripts such as Siddham as well as transliterated into Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Sinhala, Thai and other regional scripts.Dharanis are found in the ancient texts of all major traditions of Buddhism. They are a major part of the Pali canon preserved by the Theravada tradition. Mahayana sutras - such as the Lotus Sutra and the Heart Sutra - include or conclude with dharani. Gelug is the newest and currently most dominant school of Tibetan Buddhism. It was founded by Je Tsongkhapa (1357-1419), a Tibetan philosopher, tantric yogi and lama.A watchable film ignoring Brad's shortfalls, makes you live and think.

Seven Years in Tibet,"Brad Pitt is acclaimed Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer who leaves his expectant wife to climb in the Himalayas. A couple of high-altitude mishaps and the commencement of WWII see him and colleague Peter Aufschnaiter (David Thewlis) interred by the British and confined to a POW camp. After a few failed attempts, the pair manage to escape and after some perilous trekking through the hostile wilderness, they find themselves at the gates of the holy city of Lhasa. Foreigners are not especially welcome here, but they are fed and watered and gradually become accepted to the point where Harrer is introduced to the Great Mother and thence to the young, curious and engaging Dalai Lama himself. The spiritual leader takes a shine to his new friend with golden hair and the older man regales him with tales of wonder from the outside world. Simultaneously, their much larger and increasingly more territorial neighbour has clear designs on Tibet. With troops massing on the borders, the precarious nature of the independence of this small country becomes more obvious and, well history is never far from the narrative. I think Pitt plays well as the arrogant climber and as the story develops so does his character - from a selfish loner to one who learns to care for things greater than just himself. To that end, Thewlis also delivers strongly as the pair bond - despite themselves, sometimes - and ""Jamyang Jamtsho Wangchuk positively oozes a decency and spiritualism as the boy who is fighting a losing battle against those who think religion is a ""disease"". Though it does rather oversimplify the politics, this film is beautifully shot with some genuine Tibetan scenes around the amazing architecture that is the Potala Palace and by the denouement you can't help but empathise with a nation that just wanted to be left in peace to live in peace.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

I have to say that the photography of this film is great.Heinrich Harrer (Pitt) is an Austrian mountaineer who leaves his pregnant wife in Austria in 1939 in order to climb the Nanga Parbat in India but once there he is going to be arrested with his team mates because Germany attacked Poland (WW2) , he will get to escape with a team mate and his way of seeing life will change forever when they get to the city of Lhasa ..6 stars = regular",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Not being brilliant, it's a good movie.","This film follows the course of the German climber Heinrich Harrer, who travels to Tibet in order to climb a mountain. The failure of the attempt and the outbreak of World War II takes him to a prison camp (India was a British colony), from where he manages to flee to Tibet, a neutral country outside of English jurisdiction but very averse to visits from foreigners . However, he is able to enter and settle in the capital, where he meets the young Dalai Lama and helps in his education. Thus begins a great friendship between the two, portrayed in a touching way. The plot has a strong story behind it and is truly interesting, with well-developed moral and historical backgrounds, though it does not focus much on the historical facts but rather on the protagonist's personal connection with what happened there. I felt that the Chinese invasion was almost a footnote in the film, and the movie ended up losing with that absence. Brad Pitt gave life to the protagonist and, despite a reasonable performance, was not totally happy with his character. It seems that he has never really been in the shoes of the climber he plays. David Thewlis had more capacity for his character but, being a secondary character, there was little for the actor. One never comes to understand whether Harrer is a sympathizer of Nazi ideas or whether he was merely a victim of events, like so many Germans who suffered from World War II and who have never reviewed the ideas of the regime. The film explores the whole Tibetan ambiance very well, with its impressive scenery and scenery. Although the film fails to create a mountain epic with an emotive background, it is good enough to merit our attention and does a good job showing a little of what Tibet has been in the past. I'm even surprised that this film has not been nominated for a single Oscar, but maybe political reasons have silenced the Academy.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Half-way up the mountain,"The scenary's the real star of Seven Years in Tibet: the film begins with some excellent mountain climbing sequences, and the bleak but gorgeous Himalayan skyscape looms high above all subsequent action.  But Brad Pitt, in the lead role, is as wooden as his accent, with none of the charisma he later showed in Fight Club, though David Thewlis is predictably excellent as his companion.  Unfortunately, the film's depiction of Tibetan society seems idealised; and most crucially, the everyday reality of life in Tibet for the German mountaineers is dealt with only sketchily, in spite of the film's great length and in spite of the fact that it's this that underpins the development of the characters throughout the story.  But the story itself is good (and tragic); and the film gets enough right to make you want to know more about the land and its history.

A remarkable movie,"True to the spirit of Tibet, with an incredible attention to details (both at materialistic and spiritual levels), this movie is a remarkable achievement. The challenge undertaken was all the more impressive that the main characters portrayed in the movie (Heinrich Harrer and the Dalai Lama) were still alive at the time the movie was made (50 years after the facts !), because of the political sensitivities involved in the making of the movie and (as a partial result) the various locations involved in the film-making. In the end, one has to wonder how everything was orchestrated for the movie to appear so seamless, so fluid.Beyond the beautiful scenery and story, the movie also stimulates a genuine reflection on cultural clashes, spirituality and materialism, personal goals and true achievements. At times moving, at times funny, it manages to subtly superimpose the destinies of a people and the main characters.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A Tibetan version of ""Lawrence of Arabia.""","Like ""Lawrence of Arabia"", the scenery (Tibet and the Himalayan Mountains) add to the appeal of this film. But there is also a story line connection -- a British office/Austrian mountain climber with personal psychological issues becomes adviser to Prince Faisal/the Dalai Lama. That's about as far as I can stretch the analogy because Lawrence led the Bedouins to victory over the Turks while Heinrich Harrer (Brad Pitt) was not a military adviser and Tibet was had no victory over Communist China.I thought that Brad Pitt did a splendid job of showing arrogance, disdain and sensitivity at the appropriate times of the story.David Thewlis is perfection as Peter Aufschnaiter, a more disciplined and sensitive leader of a German mountain climbing expedition.Harrer, who already is recognized as a champion European climber, is a member of Aufschnaiter expedition to conquer Nanga Parbat in British India. During the climb they encounter adverse weather conditions. Harrer want to continue to a higher level that he hopes will be above the storm, but team leader Aufschnaiter insists on descending instead. At the bottom they are imprisoned as enemy aliens as World War II has begun and Germany is now an enemy of the British.

Well believe me, they found a way.10 minutes into the movie and I'd already given up on the script, it was dull from the first line and barely improved after that, no point waiting for a witty or insightful remark because it isn't coming.Then there was the editing. Seemingly important scenes are over in a heartbeat while pointless scenes are dragged out. Moments that seem like big twists are immediately and coincidently reversed just 5 seconds later, it's all a bit of a mess. The film never really flows, it limps along, takes a sudden leap, then limps again.Brad Pitt isn't too bad but the supporting cast is pretty hopeless, the acting quality would barely compete with a daytime soap opera, and the elevator music soundtrack just makes thing worse.If you like a bit of culture and funky scenery then it might be worth a look, but otherwise Seven Years in Tibet will feel like seven years in solitary confinement.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography

An Absolutely Epic Adventure,"Wow, what a beautiful film, an absolute feast on the eyes and the acting and character development was superb. A film that shines the spotlight on such a beautiful country and and it's devastating downfall, a subject rarely touched by Hollywood or even known about in the western world. It was interesting to have been educated somewhat on the history of this almost forgotten country and the problems the region faces even up untill the present day.

Much more than a Brad Pitt movie,"Maybe it's a fascination with the Dalai Lama. Maybe it's the breathtaking Tibetan landscapes. Maybe it's the lively characterization of the Tibetan people. Any way you look at it, in spite of its faults this film is an engaging, intimate portrayal of a young spiritual leader in his formative years and the people of Tibet in a time of cultural metamorphosis and impending political subversion. Brad Pitt's performance as the Austrian Heinrich Harrer is commendable, if not the highlight of the film. The extroversion of his character is believable, humorous at times, at other times painful. This is a story of growth, change, evolution and upheaval on many levels; personal, spiritual, cultural and political. Though predominantly Western in perspective this film still takes a thought provoking look at Eastern thought, values and culture.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Amazing - a Brad Pitt movie I didn't like.,"The acting, other reviews notwithstanding, was remarkably well-done. Brad Pitt handles the role of an annoying, obnoxious Austrian climber quite well. Other acting is fine. The story could have been riveting, but somehow, it misses - one never really understands or cares for the characters shown, and so the story, which could have been quite dramatic, fails to draw in this audience.Beautiful scenery and cinematography, a remarkably dramatic true story, important events that shaped the world that we live in - but I could not, try as I might, involve myself in this story. As an unabashed Brad Pitt fan (I consider him one of the top 5 actors of his generation), I expected to *love* this flick - and yet, it left me cold.It could be a failing within myself, but I tend to point toward the creative end of this movie - direction, scriptwriting, production, editing - somehow, they lost me. It's a shame, because it could have been wonderful.Good acting, dramatic story, beautifully shot - it should have been magnificent. It wasn't. Probably worth watching, just to make your own mind up on it - but don't expect too much, and perhaps you won't be as disappointed as I was. Mostly, it bored me.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Nice story,"I think this movie is great. It touches your heart and your soul. It helps to give faces to Tibetans and their plight. It speaks about the German invasion and an individual's struggle towards becoming themselves. I thought it was amazing. To see a man, who would not take no for an answer or accept that he could be held down. Continue to fight despite what others said and learning who he is gaining peace in his objectives towards life and achieving his goal. Planting the Tibetan Flag was an awesome contrast to the beginning when he was told to plant the flag with the swastika. The movie contained depth and broaden/confirmed my perception regarding why we are here. Maybe I am simple but I thought it was great. There is more to life than this, if I could give it all up and lead that lifestyle my life would be good. Only thing I hated to see was the oppression.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Well acted by everyone involved, well directed, and the soundtrack is awesome.The question that springs up at the end of this movie is ""Why didn't Western countries step in to prevent the mass genocide!? They just let it happen?"". We posture on being anti-dictator and anti-genocide, but many western countries and administrations continue to appease the Chinese Communist Party to this very day, the very same CCP that killed 80 million Chinese people, over a million Tibetans, and continue to oppress and genocide people all over China at this very moment, such as the Uyghurs, Mongolians, Tibetans, and Chinese.I feel this movie should be shown in schools the world over.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Hoho, if that's true, the civil war wont take so long, not even to mention the Long march happened in the 1930s.Second, I read on internet that there was no battle happened, the Tibetan army surrender during night, not so sure about that, but definitely, not like the movie shows, the PLA shoot with AK47? 4, Man, before the communist went there, there should be the KMT, now set down in Tawain, they use traditional Chinese, not the simplified Chinese showed in the picture of ' Chinese Commision'.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography

I love this movie,"First I have to say my english is not very good. I have seen the comments of others on movie 7 years in Tibet and would like to say my opinion. Of course the movie is long, it shows a long period spent in Tibet and follows the book. I am deeply interested in buddhism and Tibet and for me the movie is beautiful. I am not interested, for example, in films about mafia and for me the movie ""Goodfather"" is nothing. Or for example ""The raging bull"" - why should I be interested in the life of some boxer, even if film is very well made and with good actors? Those films are full of actions because show such theme and that is what people like, such is this world. And ""7 years in Tibet"" is not such film. And why anybody should be interested in the chinese occupation of Tibet? The same was with my country, during our fight for liberation the world has sentenced us to death. Such is this world.

Once again Pitt tackles a role involving a foreign accent (of sorts) and does an admirable job; appearance-wise it certainly wasn't difficult to impersonate an Austrian skiier, but the sequence of the changes that took place within the persona of Heinrich Harrer over the years as the story unfolds was well portrayed. Even the uninformed will now know something about Tibet and its plight as both a nation and a people.

"Excellent film, if slightly one-track","This is an excellent film. I put it in the Cry Freedom genre, although if anything it is better than that. I cannot understand people saying it is too long. The whole point about the opening sequence is to set up the contrast of the ego-centricity of Heinrich with the humility of the Dalai Lama and his Tibetan people. Without that beautiful contrast the film would lose its meaning. There is a delightful portrayal of Tibet and its people. This becomes the film's only weakness: it really is a cause celebre, and therefore slightly one-track. But the spiritual insights engendered soar above that problem, without ever being as 'in your face' as Cry Freedom was from a decade or so ago.A truly superb film.

A Dramatic Triumph.,"Pitt gives us a moving portrayal of Heinrich Harrer, a man torn between two worlds - that of his commitment to his wife in Austria (under the flag of the Nazi's) and his passion for  mountain climbing. Annaud successfully covers Heinrich's hard journey through the Himilayas until he finally arrives in Tibet. From there, Heinrich comes to terms with his pompous ego - his materialistic ideals - next to the backdrop of a sacred country on the eve of an invasion from the Chinese communist forces.A little dramatically incoherent in the preliminary scenes, the film suggests it could have gone for longer (hopefully a Director's Cut may be available). The Tibetan culture itself could also have been examined more closely.Nevertheless, the film is a dramatic triumph from its stunning photography to its inspiring score by the master John Williams, with stirring cello solos from Yo-Yo Ma.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
seems like seven hours of tedium,"Despite the sumptuous photography, and a score - almost unnoticeable - by John Williams, this movie can only be recommended to fans of Tibetan culture or those interested in the history of the Chinese invasion of Tibet. It is based on the true story of the 1940's Tibetan sojourn of Heinrich Harrer, an Austrian mountain climber. The movie is too long, and too many events are crammed into the first half-hour. Pitt, doubtless chosen for his blond Nordic good looks, is spectacularly miscast here; his Austrian accent sounds like Sylvester Stallone doing Colonel Clink.

Beautiful Tibet,"I like this movie for the depiction of Tibetan culture. I have never been there, but the scenic beauty captured in the movie inspires me to visit that place. It is not the best movie, but at least someone has made an effort to bring out the plight of the Tibetans. I have been to Dalai Lama's monastery in India, which is home away from home to Tibetans since 1959. They are peace-loving people. Why should their country not be freed. Their cause has been quite under-rated at the global level. ""Seven years in Tibet"" brings about awareness of the situation of Tibet.There are some flaws in this movie. The length makes is dragging. It fails to represent the reality and modernism of Tibetan culture. Some say that there is a discrepancy in the portrayal of characters and their real selves, and that the facts have been twisted, that the Chinese never landed their plane in Tibet before the war etc. But I look at it as an attempt to bring the Tibetan issue to light. So even if some people were not actually as shown in the movie, the history remains intact.

His accent is just lousy and really unnecessary - in fact, I believe it hindered his performance which should have been much better than what was delivered. He is a particularly intelligent actor relishing obscure roles, but this role either did not require enough strangeness for him to really shine, or he just couldn't deliver the nuances of the changes in his character at that time.The movie is beautiful in and of itself, although overly long and tedious. While pretty to look at, it offered very little emotionally. It basically told the story of the Tibetans, albeit through Pitt's character's eyes, but it did concentrate, and that unabashedly, on Pitt's character's transformation. That said, I definitely could identify with the character, and felt enlightened and encouraged by the transformation itself.Without a doubt, the actors portraying the Dalai Lama stood out and were absolutely believable. Great casting for that role.

When bad weather hits, and snow comes tumbling down, the plan backfires and he and other men run into many obstacles before Tibet lays before him.

It gets really good when the two characters enter Lhasa, the ancient capital of Tibet which still exists to this day. This movie really captures Tibet's culture and people and perfectly shows the two Europeans slowly blending in with the Tibetans. What really stood out for me is the friendship between Heidrich and Dalai. The friendship was so pure and genuine it just felt so real and special. Its so nice to watch there friendship develop and how they taught each other things about their own cultures. It really does touch you when the conflict emerges, so many people pass away like it means nothing and so much cultural significance is destroyed, every moment is filled with emotion which is what makes this film a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Historical error,"""Seven years in Tibet"" isn't a great movie but it is an amusing and beautiful film over a great history, but the film has many logical faults. For instance Heinrich Harrer and his friend Peter went to the Tibet in 1941 and they were present during the intervention of PR China troops during 1950. The film, at least, must be renamed as ""Nine years in Tibet"".",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Beautiful... huh.. the end?,"This movie is shorter than my car... A Ford KA...It has a beginning, but no real end... You can smell the book right from the start. This is all about conveying feelings. And telling a real life story. But there is no 'punch line'. Extremely well filmed, much on location, but... The story won't follow through. Somehow.I'm not saying you should miss it, but why do I get the feeling this is a 'Discovery' feature???....",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Heartwarming film about friendship.,"This film was gorgeous. There's tons of beautiful foreign nature with glorious cinematography. Marvelous musical score. The storyline was deep and meaningful, it's a story about multiple friendships, religion, war and differences between cultures. It's one of the best films I've ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Underrated,"I haven't heard about this movie at all even thoe I follow several movie accounts on tiktok and instagram, I think that is weird since it's really good, my second or third favourite Brad Pitt movie. 8.4/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Slow Paced Disappointment,"I guess it depends on what you were hoping to find with this movie, but I found ""Seven Years In Tibet"" to be a slow-paced disappointment. I was hoping to come out of this with a deeper understanding and appreciation of Tibetan Buddhist spirituality. Unfortunately, aside from learning that Tibetan Buddhists respect all life and won't harm it (down to and including the lives of worms) I really didn't find much reflection of Tibetan Buddhist spirituality here. There were a lot of Tibetan customs portrayed, but I personally found little depth and no real explanation or exploration. (And, even the Tibetan Buddhist commitment to reverence for life and non-violence is obviously conditional, since the Tibetans apparently had no qualms about forming an army in a desperate attempt to beat back the Chinese.) One gets a picture here of the deep reverence in which the Dalai Lama is held by Tibetans, and of the somewhat xenophobic attitude of the Tibetans, but I found little more.The movie revolves around the experiences of Heinrich Harrer, an Austrian mountain climber who, on the eve of World War II, sets out to conquer one of the highest mountains in the Himalayas to plant the Nazi Swastika flag on its summit. Harrer was a difficult to define character. He certainly didn't come across as a devout Nazi (he insisted on calling himself an Austrian rather than a German) and he seemed to have little interest in the swastika flag that was presented to him to plant. While there might be some admiration for him on that basis, he's also an unsympathetic character as the movie starts, leaving his wife and yet unborn son in the midst of a difficult relationship. Failing to conquer the mountain, his team descends to India just as the war breaks out and he's arrested by the British as an enemy alien and sent to a POW camp, from which he escapes and makes his way to Tibet - his time and experiences there being the primary focus of the movie. Harrer clearly ""finds himself"" (if I can use that term) and becomes attached to the country, the people and the Dalai Lama in the process. As the movie ends, this takes on an overtly anti-Chinese (or, at least, an anti-People's Republic of China) feel, as the Chinese brutally invade and conquer Tibet - an occupation lasting to this day.)Brad Pitt was good in the role. I have no complaint with his performance. In fact, all the performances were good, especially that of the young actor who played the 14 year old Dalai Lama. There's some spectacular scenery (which, unfortunately, is not actually of Tibet, the mountain scenes being shot as I understand it in Argentina and Canada.) I simply would have liked a more fulfilling look at Tibetan Buddhist spirituality, and so came away somewhat disappointed with this.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
I liked this movie because of Brad Pitt.,"I really liked this movie, because I thought that Brad Pitt looked cute with his hair that blonde and I thoroughly enjoyed hearing him speak in that delightful accent of his. I also thought it was sad when he went back to see his child but I also thought when, at the end, he is with his son mountain climbing, it was very touching. I also enjoyed the parts when he was trying to run away because I felt they were funny. Last but not least, I enjoyed the parts with the Dali Lama. Pardon my spelling. So I give this movie an eight because it wasn't the best movie I've ever seen, but I really enjoyed it.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Enriching,"A beautiful mix of adventure, spirituality, and personal transformation.Brad Pitt plays Heinrich Harrer, who initially is all about the thrill of climbing and adventure, but once he encounters the serene Tibetan culture and befriends the young Dalai Lama, his perspective begins to shift. The stunning landscapes really steal the show, with breathtaking shots of the Himalayas and the peaceful Tibetan monasteries that make you want to pack your bags and go find some zen. The film delves into the themes of friendship, understanding, and the clash between Western ideals and Eastern spirituality. The interactions between Harrer and the Dalai Lama are incredibly heartwarming and insightful, providing a sense of hope and compassion that feels relevant even today. Sure, the pacing can be a bit slow for some, but it's all about the journey of self-discovery rather than non-stop action. The film beautifully captures the essence of Tibetan culture and philosophy, making it an enriching watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Film vs. book,"This film was very aesthetical, but not more. Everybody who read the book from Heinrich Harrer must be disappointed. The book describes the wonderful tibetan culture and the difficult escape across the mountains. But the film was concentrated on the person of Harrer at the expense of the Tibetans and Tibet.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Could have been a great adventure epic,"7 years in Tibet has some excellent photography and exciting, National Geographic level, location shots. Brad Pitt is surprisingly good. His German accent is apparently coached by Schwarzenegger. We never read the book, but some of the dialog is simply atrocious. The "" Nazi "" beginning is totally ridiculous and not necessary. Even civilians wear swastica armbands. The ending of the film is totally wrong, it just does not fit the time, location, mood of the fifties in Austria. From a dramaturgical point the ending - as the beginning cheapens the film. The young Dalai Lama is wonderful and so are all the palace interiors and rituals. The various action scenes are badly directed AND cut. The whole movie needs some heavy pruning. A strong, merciless, editor could save the film without reshooting one scene !",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Kundun vs Seven Years in Tibet,"This was well-acted and the scenery and costumes were impressive. But either the story line of this film or that of Kundun is bogus.I suspect that the Brad Pitt character was far less important to Tibetan history that suggested here, but perhaps more so than in Kundun, which shows NO Western tutors or acquaintances of the Dalai Lama.I saw both films and would say that this one has better scenery and the plot was more suspenseful. From what I know about Tibetan history,though, Kundun was more accurate historically and was filmed in Asia, whereas Seven Years was filmed in Peru. Both films seem too be quite sympathetic to the Tibetan plight of being a nonviolent people having their country taken over by force. An aside: Buddhism is the worlds' ONLY major religion of Aryan origin.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
First Movie I Ever Threw Away,"Pitt has an overweight gain sense of who he is and what a roll in a major movie with ensemble casting and core reality has scripted for playing out.Not one word nor line hits the mark of an honorable guy that deserves to have a story likably told about him.Caring about Heinrich should be there, but is nowhere there. (Pitt's usual distancing from creating a lead that is wanted identified with.)There's not even a sense of drill practice for good acting.""Look at me!"" and an amateurish slide on ice with a talentless turn around to see no one is watching, and so he falls down, while we the audience are stuck laboring with witnessing what makes no sense of the gamble of time and money spent to worry where we went wrong. Core scene of what the entire lackluster venture is about.Timothy Hutton, Sean Penn, and some others true-to-form and understanding what Acting is could have nailed the roll into Classic territory potentially, and potently.Pitt and his Pittiful distancing from real Acting integrity and honest understanding of Acting botches what again does not deserve to even be called a movie.Tom T.wgadstar@gmail.comRoll.Well rounded momentum that is moving in some direction even if it is backwards from where we begin to witness where it is to where heading.Roll with the punches, or roll while punched, is still heading somewhere.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Seven years in Tibet took me about seven years,"Being one of those overrated movies and in my opinion the worst Brad Pitt movie I've seen so far, I'm going to take a dump right now and start thinking what to write next because I cannot remember one scene of this desert nightmare.It was that much of a disappointment I guess. No it wasn't that bad, but still not passing the shoplifter movie making exam. I remember dramedy, chasing scenes and arguing about sharing stuff but I could be wrong. The other actor David Thewlis really disappointed not to mention the rest of the cast and most of all I found this film to be so bloody boring.With four hits in a row it was probably meant to be going downhill at some point. I'm guessing Brad's energy for acting was still stuck with Se7en, Twelve Monkeys, Sleepers and The Devil's Own.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Horrible acting, very stereotypical","Now, it's Brad Pitt, who's too busy looking at himself to truly ""fit"" his roles appropriately. I didn't expect much of this movie before I saw it and I was rather underwhelmed by the thin plot, stereotypical characters, and horrible acting. Why Pitt was chosen for the title role I don't understand, but he ruined the role AND the movie. I know that this story was supposed to have significant meaning, after all Tibet, where this movie was based in, has had turmoil with the Chinese for so long, but the filmmakers did a lousy job trying to put this story together and KEEP IT together.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wouldn't watch it again,"I feel like they tried to put too much info in very little time at the beginning and that makes it lack depth.
It has an overall good message. I liked the dynamic Heinrich has with Danai Lama, feels very refreshing from how fast things are going.
There's no emotional meaning behind the relationship between Harrer and Aufschnaiter, apart from the time they spent together. We don't really see an arch on Harrer's morals, more like a very sharp turn our of nowhere because of a watch
Simple review for a simple movie, in my opinion",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
SevenTY years is more like it!,"Visually stunning movie...and Brad Pitt, et al, did a good job in the acting department, but... it is simply TOO LONG! It takes 2/3 or so of its time to demonstrate that Brad's character is a real jerk, then, in the remaining 1/3, shows how he changes. Unfortunately, the long build-up seriously dilutes the impact of the conclusion. (Still, I will confess to having a lump rise in my throat during the scene in which Harrar visits his son, unwraps the Dalai Lama's parting gift [his prized ""Clair de lune"" music box], and leaves it for the boy...)",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good movie,"OK, the first thing that needs to be mentioned is the accent. Brad Pitt's Austrian accent is quite poor, but he does a good enough acting job that he nearly makes up for it. The music and visuals are great, although about average for John Williams. The main draw for this movie is watching Harrer's transformation from arrogant prick to thoughtful man. I haven't read Harrer's autobiography so I can't comment on that, but I like the somewhat subtle uses of historical events throughout this movie. The secondary character, Peter, is another interesting character and acts as a moral foil to Harrer's arrogance throughout the first hour. The scenes with the Dalai Lama were funny and emotionally touching, but the child actor laughed way too much in the first few scenes with him. To wrap it all up, Seven Years in Tibet is an emotionally gripping film with a cliché but touching plot and above-average acting.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I were well-versed in Asian history,"I didn't know much about Seven Years in Tibet before seeing it other than the title and the fact that Brad Pitt was in it. As I watched it, I kept wondering why filmmakers decided to tell Heinrich Harrer's story. While it had some interesting insights into Tibetan culture, I found the story to be dry and fairly uneventful. Also, Pitt's quasi-Austrian accent made me run to Google to make sure it wasn't just me that was distracted by it. Spoiler alert: it wasn't just me. And as the film dragged on, I found myself becoming less interested in what was going on. I did like John Williams' score, though.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Average one time watch starring Pitt,"Seven Years in Tibet could have been so much more, but as it stands it is a merely passable film based on the early years of Dalai Lama. This was a controversial film upon release and if I am not wrong its outright banned in China. It's a good film based on the real experiences of an Austrian explored and the dalai lama during some difficult period in Tibetian history(basically Chinese Occupation). Brad Pitt plays the lead character and is pretty alright. David Thewlis plays his mate. The child playing the young Dalai Lama steals the show though and the scenery of Tibet is a plus point. Great topic but an average film.",,Anonymous,Biography
Beautiful storytelling,"Back when Hollywood gave a monkey's about Tibet. Nowadays the 'woke' hypocrites of Hollyweird cast white Tilda Swinton as a 'Celtic monk' to replace an original Tibetan monk character from the Marvel comics 'Doctor Strange', in order to not upset the genocidal CCP. The 90s were truly a great decade for cinema and 'Seven years in Tibet' were truly one of it's gem. I didn't really rate Brad Pitt as an actor until this film and another 90s gem 'Se7en'.",,Anonymous,Biography
Long but engrossing,"I watched this film in the state of mind that I watch ""City of Angels"" or anything else that is more feeling than plot or action - taking a breath and letting the peace fill me up. Yes, Brad Pitt's, and all the rest of the European characters', accents were annoying, but overlook that to watch someone begin to find peace, only to have the horror of war revisited on him; and worse, on a people who haven't experienced it in modern history (I'm assuming, you never hear about Tibet in a war, but my knowledge of Asian history is woefully weak). And, because I didn't know what was coming, I felt the shock and invasion of the Chinese along with the peaceful Tibetans. This film has made me want to learn much more.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Very good, but extremely long movie!!","I think the editors were afraid to cut on this one - as far as I'm concerned, the film did not justify the budget... way too long, many scenes and side-tracking plot lines could have been done without. Brad Pitt was okay - by no means fantastic, but not bad either. His accent was a little uneven and at times he lost it completely. The only really incredible performance in the film was by the young Dalai Lama - just fantastic!By the end of the film, I felt sort of cheated, but there were some really good moments - obviously a Brad Pitt vehicle though. Disappointing.",,Anonymous,Biography

Better than Krippendorff's Tribe? Yes.,"I have one thing to say to people who don't like this film 'shut up. shuttttt up. shuuuuuttttt uppppp."" I actually am in my seventh year of living in tibet and this film is painfully realistic. I too have been ice skating with a buddhist monk and have occasionally found it cold. Spot on, lads. The only thing that has kept me going in this chilly, chilly place is being able to pick up channel 5 from a small tv aerial i found beneath a rock. Every saturday afternoon I watch 'The Mag' and it helps me stay sane. I think that if you don't like this film you are a total Kundun. It's the best film since Krippendorff's Tribe.",,Anonymous,Biography
