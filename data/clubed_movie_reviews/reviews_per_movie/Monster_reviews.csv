Lying Down With Dogs.,"An intense, depressing movie. It sticks pretty close to the facts but focuses chiefly on the relationship between Charlize Theron as Lee and Christina Ricci as Selby. The police are hardly there at all. In fact, neither is anyone else except for Bruce Dern who makes one or two short but welcome appearances.It could easily have been a by-the-numbers TV movie. (Come to think of it, it has, hasn't it? With Jean Smart?) But the production values are good, and the time and money has been spent on this film that we usually associate with feature films.The cinematography is outstanding. The shots of Lee near the end of her rope, hitching on a foggy blue nightime Florida highway look like a desktop theme from some arty horror/occult site. The script doesn't have many tag lines. No ""Rosebuds"" or ""I coulda been a contendah."" Nor is it folksy or catching in some other way. The dialogue follows the story in being pretty straightforward and without much in the way of noticeable touches. The director should be commended on her handling of two things. One is the explanation for Lee's crimes. None is given. There is a short scene in which Lee tells one of her johns about her miserable childhood, but the abuse excuse is vitiated by Selby's mother, an orthodox and unimaginative woman, who says simply that lots of people have hard childhoods without growing up like Lee. And the men are not all turned into sadistic hogs, which must have been a temptation for the writers. The second virtue in the direction is its management of the murders. Instead of exploding heads, there are a few squibs, and usually not even that, before the victim yields to the fathomless, cool, enwinding arms of death. The themes explored here are not so much violence as love and desperation.Ricci looks the part, with her broad forehead and tiny lips, but comes across more as a Valley Girl than the kind of outcast who would pick up and move off with someone like Lee.Which brings us to Theron's performance as Lee. It's startling, of course, to see a glamor-puss like Theron so thoroughly deglamorized. It's the kind of performance that wins Academy Awards -- lesbians, the height-challenged, autistics, all have won awards in recent years. Theron deserves recognition for her effort too, but not just because of the makeup and wardrobe. They're all splendid. Makeup has shaved her brows to a Mona Lisa extent and turned her face just blotchy enough and given her a raggedy set of teeth.But that's not all that has made her performance as the central character so memorable. (She's in almost every frame.) And it isn't the thirty or so pounds that she put on for the role either. What's so homeric about that? I can put on thirty pounds without blinking an eye, and enjoy doing it. Heck, I can put on forty or fifty if she wants to get into a peeing contest. No -- it's Theron herself who MAKES the character. She's great, particularly in her physical manifestation of Lee -- her body language, for instance. Instead of coasting through the role, she animates it. The way she struts around with her shoulders thrown back and her face down, emphasizing her several chins and the girth of her neck. Maybe it takes a profession ballerina to figure out these little techniques. Her voice isn't as coarse as that of a hooker who constantly puffs on cigarettes, but Theron does what she can with her own. She overcomes her native South African speech with no trouble and introduces us to a breathless bravado that she's never used on screen before -- not that I know of.Her movements, her speech, her dreams, are filled with a desperate illusion that doesn't exactly make us feel sorry for her but does make us worry for her -- that she might, for instance, start screaming at any minute and never stop. A nerve-racking picture of a ruined soul.Is it worth seeing? Absolutely. You won't learn too much about how Aileen Wournos turned into the person she did. Even the narrative itself is a little confusing at time, so that you can't be sure where Lee and Selby are at given moments. But it's Hollywood professionalism at one of its rare high points. It's made by a mature team for an audience of adults. Refreshing.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"About as bleak and depressing as they get, but in no way a bad movie","After just seeing this film, I'm pretty much speechless. This is a tough film to comment on. This is mainly due to the fact that it's a serial killer film where you actually end up feeling sympathy for the killer. Near the end of the film, when it goes completely out of control for Aileen Wuornos, there's no feeling of ""justice is done once again""... quite the contrary, actually. It's so moving and disturbing, following this person's life, through the last part of it. In the beginning, we get a fairy tale-like presentation of Aileen's hopes and dreams in her young years. Without warning, we're thrust into the hard reality of her current years, immediately afterward. From there on out, we're in her world, feeling her pain, experiencing her failures. We get to know her as the film goes on, but we feel for her from the very beginning, without even knowing why she is like she is. That says something about the masterful direction and writing of Patty Jenkins that is featured in this film. The plot is great, and it's surprisingly easy to follow the thought process of Aileen... we understand why she kills. The pacing is very good, there are only few scenes that seem to move slow, and I don't think there was really any point where I was bored. The locations is incredibly authentic. Jenkins actually went out of her way to get shooting done at several places where the real Aileen had been, and even cast people who had met her in smaller roles. Cinematography is great. Acting is pretty much flawless; both Theron and Ricci shine in their roles. The movie also has a unpleasant view of prejudice from the 'other side'(the people who become victims to prejudice), and hopefully this will act as a much needed wakeup call for the people who believe in and go by prejudice. What really makes this film have an impact is how dark and real it is. No happy ending, no silver lining... just tough, uncut reality. When you see it, you can't help getting engulfed in this person's world. The raw horror of her life moves you. I can't see anyone, no matter ignorance, beliefs or moral and ethic standpoint coming out after seeing this film and believing that Eileen was the 'bad guy' in this story. It's just not possible. I haven't seen any of the interviews with the real Aileen Wuornos and I didn't follow her case, but I would like to know more about her, find out what she was like to a greater extent than a movie of 1 hour and 45 minutes can tell me. That's what this movie did to me. It made me care for this person, and that says more than anything I can put in this review. You need to see this film, unless you refuse to watch anything that has harsh reality instead of a happy ending. I recommend this to anyone who can take it. This movie will depress most people, but after this one viewing, I consider it required viewing for just about anyone. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Black day for Hollywood if she doesn't win the Oscar,"Charlize Theron's performance in this movie was so incredible I felt compelled to shout about it to every single person I know. I was so blown away by her that her performance actually reignited my own passion for acting and made me realize why I'm trying so hard to break into this business and to do it well. I never thought that Charlize Theron (of whom I was never a big fan) of all people could make me remember what movie-making is all about. With one role, she's converted me into a life-long fan. If Oscar means anything anymore, she deserves that award, hands-down. The movie itself is one of the most gripping and emotional stories I've ever seen in a film, and, true or not, its right up there with the other great indies depicting the sorry lives of Middle-Americans, such as Boys Don't Cry and, ironically, Monster's Ball. I wept straight through the last twenty minutes of this movie, continued weeping intermittently throughout the day, and wept some more about it during my preparation for acting class the following day. Before I saw the film, I saw Charlize on The Daily Show, talking to John Stewart about how Aileen Wuornos' story (and I'm paraphrasing) forces one to re-examine how we might label someone ""evil"" for doing horrible things. I thought, that's just a bunch of liberal bulls**t. Then I saw the movie. Like I said, we can't know how much of the movie is one-hundred percent factual, but it's almost scary how little that mattered to me after I left the theater. This film moved me so much that I actually decided then and there that I would, that I would have to, think a little harder the next time I thought of someone as ""evil"". If the goal of the filmmakers was to just try to get people to think about the fairness of the death penalty, I believe they succeeded.",,Anonymous,Biography
Decent but Historically Inaccurate,"I enjoyed the story that this movie had to offer, but it was not even close to the true events behind Aileen Wuornos. It's very romanticized, which makes a beautiful and tragic story, but if you're looking for the real history behind the infamous serial killer prostitute, I'd recommend a documentary.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
I knew Aileen.,"Why would someone want to be comment number 458? Because it might mean something to somebody. This movie meant a lot to me.I spent about four hours, sole-to-sole, in the back of a pickup truck hitch hiking with her and a friend of mine in Florida. This was before she had killed anybody, I believe.Years later, I saw the ""wanted"" drawing. It sort of rang a bell, but a lot of usual suspects look like that, don't they? What are the chances? Then, they caught her and showed the first photo, then gave both the nickname (like a cousin), and the real name (like another cousin, only spelled in Irish.) At the time, she mentioned the spelling with an ""A."" I asked her if she was Irish and told her about my two cousins. What a small world, right? She either told me her last name and I assumed it, or told me she was Greek. The point being, the whole name aspect was the first part of a four hour life story discussion we had. And you don't forget four hours of a face like that either. The life stories matched. It was her.The mood swings Charlize Theron portrays are perfect, as are the mannerisms, body language, clothes, teeth, complexion, hair, the body fat, manner of speaking, that strutting walk and just everything. It was absolutely uncanny. You never forget someone like that, and then when they pop up alive like that again. It was just unreal.She was mood swinging, or perhaps ""cycling,"" the whole time I was with her. I imagine if that was portrayed realistically, the movie would be unwatchable. I remember thinking at the time, her behavior seemed like the popular portrayal of those ""possessed.""After I saw Monster more than twenty years later, I called the other guy that was with me. We have remained friends over the years. I told him ""Oscar this, Oscar that,"" blah blah blah, just out of the shock of reliving the experience of Aileen again. The fact that she was played by the glamorous, beautiful, Charlize Theron on top of it, was beyond all comprehension. What a transformation! Of course, my beloved, goof-ball buddy was sitting beside her sleeping most of the time in the truck. His head kept on falling on her shoulder and she would push it off. It was like Three Stooges. They shared the Doritos like it was the school cafeteria or something. Can you imagine, in hindsight? Yes, it is good for a few jokes, I admit it. She hadn't killed anyone yet, so far as I can tell from reading about her and piecing the time-line back together. This was the first and only time I had been in Florida in those college-age days, so putting that together was fairly easy.I don't know if I ever met anyone, before or since, that I have felt more sympathy for at the time. She was very talkative, about herself and the hard times she'd had. She was believable. She wasn't scamming us or anything, as I first suspected, just shooting the breeze. I wanted to cry for her. I think I even did so later, in hindsight. She was unreal. She had, what I thought, were ""multiple personalities."" Really just two, she would laugh one second, cry the next. She was like a big, tough hard-ass girl of eight years. She told me all about her childhood abuse, the horror of being a prostitute, and taking beatings and abuse from the men. She mentioned living in hotels. She didn't seem like too much of a drinker or a druggie. I just thought she was deeply, emotionally disturbed. In those days, we should have said ""mental."" My friend and I were a couple of happy middle-class college snowbird guys on Christmas break. She had about the worst kind of life of anyone I had ever met. She was only about four or five years older than us, but looked twice her age. When I thought later about the hand she was dealt, compared to mine, you better believe the religious feelings and tears well up. They still do. I can't bear to watch the movie sometimes, or at least parts of it.Yes, what she did was wrong, if not evil. I don't think she was evil though, at all. She had the innocence lost, naive but semi-funny sweetness portrayed in the movie. I don't usually contemplate these things, its just that you could see there was a good person there, just profoundly _____ed up. For some reason, I was proud of her when she wanted the execution. She was nothing if not honest. As an outside observer, I don't know how you feel sorry for someone like that, but if you knew what happened, you just might. I have no agenda in that regard. Watch this and ask yourself if monsters are made, or are they born? This movie captures my feelings perfectly. If you have read this far, you can see the conflict. The movie reflects that so well, I can not do it justice by praising it with words.If you were a victim of her actions, I wouldn't blame you for hating what I'm writing. If I read something like this about Charlie Manson, I'd never believe it.I just want to thank everyone involved in telling this bizarre story.I would advise people to see this if they want to be challenged, not just entertained. I've read some of the headlines on the index. So should you.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Theron's Performance Makes It Worth A Look,"This was not an easy movie to like but I was so enthralled at Charlize Theron's makeover and performance that it took center stage over the story.Theron's physical transformation from the incredibly beautiful woman she is to hard-and-rough looking serial killer Aileen Wournos was just amazing. More than that, I appreciated her effort here, not just with all the makeup but all the mannerisms, the way she walked, moved her head, speech inflection....everything. She was worth the price of the film and I felt the same way after the second viewing months later.The story is a sordid one, filled with a lot of f-words, so be ready for that if you haven't seen it and wondered about the language. It's very rough. It also includes a lesbian relationship between the two main characters, a relationship I have yet to find that anyone found appealing, frankly.I may not be able to recommend the movie for its story but if you want to see an actress really step out of her element and give a great performance, check it out. My guess is that you'll either really like this film or hate it.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Gripping but incredibly depressing,"Based on a true story this movie is about Ailen Wuornos, a prostitute, who killed quite a few men who she ""serviced"".  She was convicted in 1990 and executed in 2002.She's played by Charlize Theron who's just incredible.  It starts off just before she began murdering men and has met Selby (Christina Ricci), an adorable lesbian who loves her.  It basically chronicles their relationship and what led Wuornos to kill these men.  Also she reaccounts her childhood and how she became a prostitute.  It's more than a little depressing--it's a tragic story of a beaten woman who saw murder as the only way out.  Only three murders are shown and that's more than enough.  The violence is not glorified--it's bloody and sick and one is the most harrowing thing I've seen in years.  What's so fascinating (and scary) about this film is that I actually began to sympathize with Wuornos!  While I could never condone her actions you can see clearly what led her to it.  This is a rare film--it makes a serial killer look sympathetic.Theron is a wonder in this--she became Wuornos (who was very unattractive). She gained weight, shaved off her eyebrows, colored her hair, used contacts and dentures to change her appearance completely.  Never once did I think I was seeing Theron acting--she BECAME Wuornos.  A great performance--she'll easily get the Oscar for this one.  Ricci is also good here.  She's been ignored in the press but she nicely underplays the role of Selby and is a perfect contrast to Theron's acting.  Also nice to see Bruce Dern in a small role.Music is used very effectively here.  They play songs of the time it took place (1980s) so you know when this is happening and also nicely complements the actions on screen (especially with Journey's ""Don't Stop Believing"").A very good movie but a very depressing one.  Proceed at your own risk.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Brilliant film; extraordinary, moving performance","I just saw again Monster, followed by Nick Broomfield's gripping documentary on Aileen Wuornos, and what a brilliant film it is. It sort of reminded me of the kind of movies they used to make in the '70s, where the characters were really the center and they weren't trapped by formulas or by the self-indulgency of the director or the actors. The characters aren't judged, but they're shown with their humanity. With empathy. The result is not your usual indie movie that tries to be hip, or a sugar-coated version of this tragic story with an answer for everything and a nice confortable message in the end, but a truly moving and absorbing film that focuses on the people whose story is telling. At the core there's the amazing performance from Charlize Theron, who's deserving of all the praises and the awards she got. Her work is powerful, subtle, moving and layered. It's incredible to watch Broomfield's documentary, after seeing the film. Sometimes it really seems like watching the same person. It's not only that she recreated her mannerism, which she did perfectly, she's also, somehow, got her energy, as a person. She got to the emotional reasons as to why Aileen's mannerism was like that. In short: an extraordinary performance and a powerful film.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Charlize Theron's big performance,Charlize Theron did here a great job and it was no question worth an Oscar. Every scene was well studied and executed and this true story came to a dramatic showdown. This movie could be very helpful for many prostitutes showing them the possible dangers of their job. It's a must see for Charlize Theron's big performance but also for Christina Ricci's very respectable role. Christina Ricci was very believable too as her girlfriend. I watched it in first line only for the characters and in second line less for the story. I can highly recommend it for all film fans who appreciate serious acting and who love true stories. You cannot expect too much action but therefore lot of dramatic moments. 6.5/10.,6.0,Anonymous,Biography
For once the Academy got it right!,"For once the Oscar went to the most deserving. I was not sure I wanted to see this movie, but after seeing a trailer I became curious and decided to check it out. Charlize Theron completely blew me away! She is barely recognizable and seems to be channeling Wuornos at some points. Patty Jenkins is to be highly complimented on her writing and directing skills also. Rarely have I been so moved by a film but this one simply cuts to the core and leaves you raw. Wuornos was obviously not well, yet Jenkins provides insightful monologues that allowed me to understand and sympathize for Wuornos. It is a sad and moving movie. Never have I felt so disturbed yet riveted by a movie such as this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Pretty good, yet lacking","This film, is pretty good, owing most of course to the intriguing story and the great acting of all involved (in particular that of Charlize Theron). For me though, the film holds a couple of flaws as well though. First of all, I find the end and the way Wuornos is picked up in the end a bit hard to believe, with regards to her suspicious nature towards depicted throughout the film. Also, the film could have shown more of the trial of Aileen. Maybe it is, because I am a psychology student, but in my mind (judging from the portrayal of Theron of course) this woman was mentally ill. Therefore I would have liked to hear some expert testimonies. Additionally I would have liked to know how many people she killed and in what time-frame etcetera. Another thing that wasn't cleared up in the film was: ""What 'old thing' was she arrested for???"" I mean, there remain numerous questioned unanswered by the film. Those who want the answers to these and all other questions check out: http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/women/wuornos/1.html?sect=11The fact that I found so many downsides to this film (in my opinion) might make it sound as if I didn't enjoy the film. This is not true. I found it heart-breaking and heart-warming at times and thought it was a pretty good movie (I did NOT regret hiring it). Yet I felt that for this movie to be GREAT, to be A CLASSIC, it would have had to be made different. Telling more of Aileen's story and not just implying some things along the way without clearing them up. Also it could have been more informative. But still, with the great acting and because it never got boring it gets a...7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Brilliantly filmed. Awfully scripted. Terrible messaging.,"TL;DR: Hollywood think YOU, the viewer, are dumb and cannot understand subtlety. They do not think you can understand that someone who was horrifically abused could turn into, well, 'a Monster'. So , they rewrote THE WHOLE of Wuornos history to give her some traits that allow you to 'relate' to her, but in reality, you can't, because the real Wuornos was so brutally damaged that she completely lacked any type of moral compass, and that does not make for good box office numbers.Longer version with receipts:Wuornos is depicted as 'picking' victims - only the 'bad guys' - Reality check: she had no empathy, and mag dumped whoever got her in the car.In fact, from reading the reviews, most reviewers seems totally unaware of the fact of this case:Wuornos met Tyria in 1986, 3 WHOLE years before the first murder. I guess that wasn't 'romantic enough', so we get this weird ""Dexter in hiding"" vibe which NEVER happened.Yes i wrote ""Tyria"" because the character you know as 'Selby"" NEVER EXISTED either.Tyria worked as a motel cleaner, the whole 'my mean Christian parent will find out' is entirely made up for the movie. She never existed either.Wuornos admitted herself that the first murder was in self defense, the other were NOT, and she repented for that. Both during her arrest, after her arrest, in jail and again during interviews. There was never 'a disabled man' spared. They all got shot from that point onwards.In addition the initial rape scene is entirely fabricated, there were never ropes, saws, or anything or that nature at the crime scene. She simply is someone who suffered too much and found an outlet in mag-dumping men looking for prostitutes. Which according to Hollywood, makes them all disgusting pigs whose families do not matter.In the films, Wuornos is pictured as 'thinking' of suicide. In our world, she attempted suicide 7 times. Wuornos committed so many petty crimes from age 12 to her final arrest, her rap sheet could fill this review page - but NONE are depicted on camera. Wuornos was a victim of horrific, unimaginable sexual abuse from a very young age (7) and of course, that's not filmable, so it doesn't' show in the movie either. That's actually the whole basis of her psychology, so it's quite the omission, and frankly the only point where one could empathize with her actions or at least find some sort of justification. But Hollyweird doesn't want the truth, because ... well you know it's actors that visited Epstein Island, not prostitute serial killers.So when ""Monster"" opens up with the dreaded ""BASED on a true story"", that's exactly the problem. We are made to empathize for the character because we can sense the men that pay her are 'pigs', but none of it happened. In our reality, her mental assessments showed she had all the signs of anti-social personality disorder, and was unable to even understand the concept of remorse.I guess a movie about a cold blooded, traumatized from birth character totally lacking empathy would not make for 'happy viewing'. So history is rewritten, and we get 'Bonny and Clyde' noughties edition instead. Oh and please note, even the love story is made up: Wuornos was a lesbian in our world, she did NOT stumble at the zodiac bar by accident, unlike in the film)But after reading the real story, one cannot help but feel that the wool was pulled over their eyes to satisfy a certain political agenda, and that none of the scene in the movie were even CLOSE to reality.This could have been a gem - and I feel Theron brilliant performance is simply thrown to the waste here.

Gripping and Tragic,"I sometimes wonder why more people can't be nice.  I wonder why the sins of the father have to plague the lives of his children.  Why people rape, abuse, hurt, and maim.  In a perfect world everyone would be happy.  In a perfect world no one would ever want.  In a perfect world a women like Aileen Wurnos would not have been sentenced to die on death row, and in a real world I wouldn't have to write about a movie like MONSTER.  It's a movie that drips with exceptional performances, and yet leaves your soul so cold to the core.MONSTER is the tragic true story of a woman who longed for a friend, and nobody came to her aid.  It stars Charlize Theron (The Devil's Advocate) as Aileen Wurnos, one of the first women to ever die on death row.  Of course the film doesn't begin that way, when we first meet her she's sitting in the rain with a gun contemplating ending it all.  You see she's has no future. She has nothing but a past that's not worth repeating, and all she has in the world is in a storage locker. What little money she has, is gained by being a prostitute.  But one day in a little bar in Daytona Beach, Florida she meets and falls for a woman that finally makes her happy.The woman is named Selby (Christina Ricci, The Opposite of Sex), and she's a young lesbian just trying to figure out the world for herself.  At first this relationship puts Aileen on cloud nine.  She's willing to do anything to provide for the first person that ever loved her.But one night when Aileen kills a john who gets a little to rough, a series of events take our characters on a one way trip with destiny. Leaving the landscape of these two women's lives are forever changed.  If only someone had just been nice to Aileen.MONSTER is not a happy film.  It's one of those movies that leaves you dead at the end.  You lose faith in humanity; you lose faith in yourself.  I like these kinds of movies, cause they convict me.  Here I am a young guy who sometimes gets ticked off at a driver in front of me on the road.  For one split moment I have murderous anger when that guy cuts me off.  What if I was in Aileen's situation?  Would I do the same thing?  I would hope not, but hey you never know.If there is one performance that will tear you up inside this year, it's Theron's.  For the entire movie you can hardly believe that this is, in real life, a beautiful women.  Theron throws all the glamour out the window, gaining weight and frumping herself up to the point of being ugly.  This is a complete 360 and she's so engrossing.  She carries the film to heights. A lesser actress might turn in a wonderful performance, but Theron was Aileen. This is some brilliant acting.I also give Kudos to Bruce Dern .  His character has the distinction of being the only person who shows any real compassion for Aileen.  While a small role it sticks out because it's the only real bit of bright light in an otherwise dark and gloomy picture.The screenplay by Patty Jenkins (Who also directed) does a great job of giving Aileen and those around her life.  What Aileen did was reprehensible. What she did was evil, and she must pay for that.  But it allows for sympathy. Not all evil is dark and black, and not all people who murder are 100% culpable.  But yet you reap what you sow no matter what you're past.MONSTER is a well-made, brilliantly acted film that's not for the weak of heart.  It's engaging, engrossing, and realistic.  I think I want to rush out and get the silliest comedy I can find right now, because I need something to offset the dark tone of this film.  While it get a fine recommendation, I just hope that the next time you feel like treating someone like crap, you'll remember just how tragic the life of Aileen Wurnos turned tragic because nobody reached out.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Play against type, reap the rewards","So another of Tinsletown's beautiful people piles on the pounds for a couple of months, spends a few hours in make-up every morning and walks away with an Oscar. Hollywood is indeed a fickle place. When they need a broad, greasy-haired lesbian serial killer who looks like she's been hit in the face with a spade, who do they pick, but Charlize Theron, one of the most attractive women in the world who, if memory serves, earns a handy extra income by promoting shampoo. Forget about all the aspiring actresses earning five dollars an hour as waitresses in LA diners, most of whom are a good deal closer to Aileen Wuornos in the looks department - lets pay millions of dollars for a celebrity, plaster her in make-up until she's unrecognisable and force-feed her Big Macs.And of course they are right. A movie like Monster needs a star and a story to make it fly. Most Academy members recognise that if one of their leading lights is prepared to slum it for a while, come off the Atkins diet and slap on some unflattering prosthetics in the name of art, then they deserve some appreciation. Put them through scenes of rape and torture and constantly greasy hair and the Oscar is a certainty. Nobody ever won an Academy Award by acting happy-go-lucky.As it happens, Theron's Oscar is about the only point of interest in the whole project. In truth, hers in an average performance in an average movie. Wuornos seems to have been a fairly nasty piece of work. A career prostitute, she is on the brink of suicide when she meets Selby (Christina Ricci) in a gay bar. The two strike up an unusual alliance and go on the run together. What follows is an unpleasant, awkward buddy movie - a downmarket Thelma and Louise - with little aesthetic or emotional appeal. Wuornos spends the entire time drinking, smoking, cussing and offing her clients while Selby slouches around in grimy motel rooms. A sort of love borne out of mutual need develops eventually as Wuornos, her trust in men shattered, succumbs to Selby physically, but it is never truly convincing.That is the trouble with true stories, as the cliché goes, they are often stranger than fiction, and when you throw in two famous, alluring actresses, the bounds of plausibility stretch ever further. Frankly, one gets the impression that Ricci, free from the constraints of half a ton of foundation slapped on her face could do a lot better. Aside from her psychotic tendencies, Theron wanders about with the same crazed bulldog-chewing-wasp expression for the whole film. Maybe she spent too long in make-up and her face dried solid. Either that or she's method acting.Monster falls in to the trap of introducing hackneyed devices to illustrate the point it's trying to make: The walls in the motels are black with dirt indicating that the whole affair is sordid and dirty; Selby's family life is ultra-conservative so THAT's why she rebels; There is the whole hooker-tries-to-get-regular-job scene that has been done a million times before. I could go on. It has all the hallmarks of a TV movie - I was half expecting high-rolling lawyers played by Brian Dennehy and Harry Hamlin to enter the fray at the trial and get her off on a technicality.I am being overly harsh. Monster is not a bad film. It just isn't very good. So to give it the Oscar-winning tag is a little misleading.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Extraordinary performances.,"I watched this on video and was completely blown away. I thought Charlize Theron's performance as Aileen was extraordinary, not simply in the scenes with the men (especially the ""last john"", when she has to shut herself off from the humanity of the man she is about to kill) and in generally suggesting an increasingly out of control personality, but in the scenes with Shelby (Christina Ricci), right up to her near-breakdown when she is putting Shelby on the bus. Despite adverse comments from other reviewers, I consider Christina Ricci's portrayal of Shelby equally remarkable, conveying childlike naivety, seductiveness, stubbornness and growing manipulativeness very well. They dominate the film between them, but the supporting performances are fine also. I gave this 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

I am a rape survivor (as a toddler and a college student), it stirred up so many feelings that I've experienced. My innocence is gone... why not try to make some money while re-claiming my sexuality? And of course, I've had a problem with viewing all men as perverts. But she did come across men that were actually wanting to help her -- I wish that could have turned her around the way one man helped me come around. And I'm so lucky to have him. I'm so glad that I chose to see this movie. I hope others can be as positively impacted by this film as I was.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Love is where you find it.,"Love and life can be cruel and down right hellish. This is a stark bio of Aileen Wuornos(Charlize Theron)who grew up in Michigan and was forced to deal with abuse, drugs and after becoming a prostitute having a child by the age 13. Wuornos would eventually move to Florida and take her anger out on men she ""serviced"" along the highway. She would enter into a lesbian relationship with a shy younger woman Selby(Christina Ricci)more than likely looking for acceptance. During a nine month period in 1989 and 1990 Wuornos would murder seven of her ""Johns"" to avenge being raped and beaten.Theron is excellent and her hard work has earned her an Oscar nomination. Ricci is believable as the young lover. Bruce Dern plays the part of an old man who befriends the highway prostitute. Vivid foul language, sexual content and brutal violence makes this a strong R.  The lesbian love making is urgent and eye popping. Believe it or not the title MONSTER is not in reference to Wuornos.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
She Never Had a Chance,"Having spent much of my youth in the presence of losers and the disenfranchised, this movie really hit home. There's no question that the Academy Award went to the correct person. The combination of rage and despair are so admirably presented a character as complex as the creases on her expressive face. It's the ultimate vicious circle. We tend to vilify someone like this because we only see the surface. But inside is that good heart that would love to become whole, but the past has too many tentacles and there are too many bruises that would need to be treated. She has no defenses. Even acting to save herself, she starts the ball rolling toward her destruction. We forget this is actually a love story, but the cards are stacked to the heavens. Great performances by Theron and Ricci. The latter brings a knowing innocence and we wonder if she will have an opportunity. Not comfortable to watch, but we need to see it.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Yes, she's a revelation--but she's the whole picture...","Charlize Theron as convicted murderess Aileen Wuornos. Intriguing true story becomes a fashion-staple's Oscar ticket, and for good reason: the speech, the mannerisms, the fierce stare, the bravado of a dead-end life on a ruinous road are all letter-perfect, and Theron's make-down gives our imagination just what it needs--nothing over the top. I found however Christina Ricci, despite some strong early scenes, badly miscast as Wuornos' bedfellow and partner in crime (she's too young, of course, but she doesn't match up well with Theron, either in stature or in their acting styles--and their love scenes are most uncomfortable). The film is slackly directed, with some of the power of the situations muffled by the editing. Scenes run on too long or not long enough, while a few of Theron's outbursts are not fully explored (sure she's angry, and she's got a right to be, but in a job interview? and why would Wuornos apply for secretarial jobs--did she feel she was above warehouse or assembly-line work where she might have excelled?). The overreaching finale misses the mark while striving for higher importance, and this is surely the fault of the director, but Theron manages to eke out a credible characterization, a performance that nearly overshadows big faults with ""Monster"". **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"The story of Aileen Wuornos told with chills and tenderness, Theron has never been better","In other hands, 'Monster' could easily have been overwrought, overly-sadistic, over-sentimental and too heavy on the melodrama, which would have done an interesting and more complex-than-one-would-think serial killer an injustice.'Monster' however turned out to be a near-flawless film, that has a real sense of the time, the brutality of the crimes and also the case's complexity. The story of Aileen Wuornos here is told here as more than just a serial killer film, it is instead a powerful film told with harrowing chills and tender humanity with Wuornos herself portrayed as more than just a monster without being glorified or over-humanised.An earth-shattering, career-best performance from Charlize Theron as Wuornos helps enormously, a performance that goes way beyond changing her appearance completely by gaining weight and using dental prosthetics to the point of being unrecognisable and is one of gentle compassion and frightening coldness. This may sound oxymoronic, but it isn't, it means that what could easily have been a one-dimensional portrait of Wuornos is given surprising complexity by Theron.She is superbly supported by an understated Christina Ricci, though one wishes that her character had a little more development and was more vividly drawn. The supporting cast all round are strong, if not burning in the memory as much or as long as Theron. 'Monster' is directed beautifully by Patty Jenkins, and the production values are similarly terrific especially in the gritty and classy cinematography that perfectly captures the dark subject matter. The music is used sparely but when used is very evocative of the period.Further advantages are an intelligent and beautifully-constructed screenplay, that balances Wuornos' character with aplomb and the different mood components with equal adeptness, and a continually gripping story that is frightfully rich in atmosphere and mood.Overall, truly excellent film especially for Theron, that avoids all the potential pitfalls it could easily have done in other hands. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Theron Ignored the Victims,"Monster claims it is ""based on a true story."" But it is not as true as you might think.True, serial killer Aileen Wuornos was convicted and then executed 12 years ago in Florida.In the movie, Wuornos is presented as a killer with a soft side in a loving lesbian relationship with her girlfriend, played by Christina Ricci.Here's the problem: If filmmakers say their movie is ""based on a true story,"" shouldn't the heart of the story be true?Down on Her Luck, or Brutal Killer?Wuornos was a prostitute who hitchhiked across central Florida to find customers. In the movie, she tries to go straight but society lets her down, making it difficult for her to find a job, so she returns to the streets.As Monster tells it, one john brutally beats and rapes Wuornos in some very disturbing scenes. When the attacker threatens to kill her, she shoots him in self-defense. When moviegoers see the graphic rape scene, many feel Wuornos is the victim. This has family members of the real victims unhappy.Theron helped produce the film, and talks about the research she did while promoting the film. I would think the research would include talking to the prosecutor, John Tanner, who spent years investigating Wuornos and the seven men she killed.But he was not consulted.""You know, these men had wives. They have daughters, brothers, sons, friends,"" Tanner told ABCNEWS. ""And anyone that sees that film is left with the impression that - at least some of the men that were murdered deserved to die and that she was acting in self-defense. It's a total lie.""Wuornos even admitted that her crimes, committed in Florida in the 1980s, were not ""self-defense."" During her trial, Wuornos took the stand and said she ""robbed"" the men and killed them ""as cold as ice.""""And I'd do it again, too, I know I'd kill another person, 'cause I've hated humans for a long time,"" said Wuornos. She then continued to claim the men were innocent while in prison, after she said she found God.""I want to come clean. There is no self-defense,"" said Wuornos. ""And so I need to come clean, I need to tell the world that there is no self-defense in my cases.""When picking up her Golden Globe for her performance, Theron thanked lots of people, but she never once mentioned the families of the murdered men.""I don't think they cared about the victims' families,"" said Linda Yates. Her mother was engaged to Gino Antonio, when Wuornos killed him. ""[Wuornos] was just a vicious person,"" said Yates.In fact, the filmmakers didn't talk to any of the victims families. Mike Humphreys' dad was also murdered. He has a problem with the way the movie was produced: ""I don't think that they ought to do this to the victims out there,"" said Humphreys.""This movie is portraying her as a victim,"" said Letha Prater. ""She isn't. She was not a victim. My brother was a victim.""Most of the family members won't go to the movie.The movie does acknowledge Wuornos killed one man who was trying to help her, but all the others are shown as johns. The families say that's cruel to them.I confronted Brad Wyman, one of Monster's producers.I told him that while in the movie, Wuornos' character is tied up, beaten and raped, but in reality, she said that never happened. ""I believe she said that in order to actually try to expedite her own execution,"" said Wyman. ""She really wanted to end her own personal tragedy.""Wyman said the filmmaker did her best to protect the victims in the portrayal, changing details including their license plates and the color of their cars. But they never spoke to the victims' families because, as Wyman puts it, they did not want to ""unearth more tragedy in their lives.""Wyman explained why the film took liberties with some facts. ""It's not a documentary. I mean in no way is it,"" said Wyman. ""It is a dramatic portrayal searching for kind of a greater truth rather than a  a factual truth.""A greater truth than factual truth?Give me a break.-- John Stoessel",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Definitely worth seeing,"""Monster"" is, overall, one of the saddest films ever, and one which doesn't step back at the view of the darkest side of existence: the fact that there are people who will lead their entire life without one single break, without any long-lasting achievements, success, or happiness. The title suits the story very well -there are many possible interpretations, but I personally like to read it as the description of what Aileen Wuornos's life is: a monster. There's nothing remotely nice in this story about her, and when she seems to have accomplished something, there's this feeling of impending doom -we know that it isn't meant to last long. The story is told by Aileen herself, in a very sarcastic and cynical tone, and she proves how adagios like ""all you need is love and self-confidence"" are just nice words, empty formulas with no real ground.The film offers a handful of good messages. For example, I find it very interesting that it doesn't chalk all that misery up to life's natural lack of any justice, so that Aileen doesn't appear as just a victim of circumstances, as she says in one moment of the film; instead, the film shows that Aileen often has the option to act one way or the other, and she makes a decision. It could have been different, she could have picked the other option, but she knows what she is doing and she gives many reasons why she's doing so. The film sympathizes with her, but doesn't pity her; it just shows her actions and the motives that she feels are valid. It doesn't justify her. The viewer is left to reach his/her own conclusions. I find this one great achievement of the film, and one that makes a big difference between this film and many dramas that wallow in pity and justification of the character's deeds.Like many have said, both Charlize Theron's and Christina Ricci's performance are flawless. I feel that Theron really deserved the Oscar. Ricci is great too, and this should be even more of note since she isn't given a lot of space to develop the character of Selby, Aileen's lover.The film has its flaws, but it still is a rather impressive document, and one that certainly gives some food for thought.",,Anonymous,Biography

Hard and bleak story,"I had my reservations before watching this. I was sceptical cause of the buzz. Everyone was talking about the way Theron, ""the most gorgeous woman alive"", transformed herself into Aileen. A prostitute who killed several clients. I thought Theron was just looking for success, another ambitious actress wanting a gold statue. That director Jenkins had a reason to make the film didn't matter for me then.But everyone involved in this film deserve the credit. Monster is gripping. It's a film that makes you feel almost every emotion you can think of: sadness, anger, compassion, wrath. It confuses you. Do you identify with Aileen or do you disapprove of her actions? I guess both. You despise her for killing the men. But the film challenges that. You can almost explain (and thus condone) her actions. I guess the one thing that stayed with me was that it occurred to me what it must feel like to be really and utterly alone in this world.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Brilliant acting... yet a disturbing movie.,"Aileen Wuornos was an obnoxious character. A highway prostitute by profession, she was ugly and foul-mouthed. She is considered to be the first female serial killer in the US. In this movie one of the most beautiful women in the world, Charlize Theron played this character and how. Hers is perhaps the most powerful acting performance by an actress I have ever seen (Hilary Swank in 'Boys don't cry' comes close). The make-up effect was extra-ordinary. How can one not mention those eyebrow-less large eyes and that flabby pimpled face, totally different from Charlize's own? And she just defined the character. She put on weight, brought out that small-town accent, that careless gait. Her Oscar win was totally obvious, now I see. And the other female character, Aileen's teenage lesbian friend Selby, was also totally awesome. This is Christina Ricci's best too. She perhaps deserved a nomination.Apart from acting, the movie is disturbing. I beg to differ from the common opinion. I think the movie is not brilliantly made. I've seen enough movies with disturbing and controversial basic theme but many of them are so superbly made that watching them never becomes tiresome. Here I got bored in the middle. Had it been not Charlize Theron, I would have probably change the channel. All the tortures on Aileen or all the murder scenes somehow lack art. This is not a movie I would watch a second time. Only because of acting and its superior screenplay I'd give it 4/5.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
This movie was incredible!,"As a Floridian, I watched Aileen Wuornos' trials and news reports as they were unfolding. She was imprisoned and put to death less than five miles from my house. I didn't see the film until after Charlize Theron won the Oscar, and so much had been made of her gaining weight and becoming unattractive for the role I was downright cynical about why she won the award. That is, until I saw the movie!Charlize Theron's on screen portrayal of Aileen is so eerily realistic that you forget it's an actress behind some prosthetics: she WAS Aileen for the entire duration of the film. I kept saying,""Oh my gosh, oh my gosh"" the whole time, as she had every single mannerism of Aileen's down to a T. It was the most impressive portrayal of a real person that I have ever seen, hands down. This woman deserved that Oscar!Although several people thought the film was sympathetic to Wuornos, I didn't see this as being the case. We saw that Aileen was manipulative, violent, abusive,and didn't take responsibility for her actions. We also saw her as a human being: vulnerable, traumatized, and lost. Despite the insight into Wuornos' humanity, we still knew she was beyond help.Christina Ricci also delivered a terrific performance as Shelby, and was a perfect complement to Charlize-as-Aileen's abrasiveness.This was the best film of 2003, IMO.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hard to Swallow,"Charlize Theron, a very beautiful woman plays the ""John Killer"" as a gawky, tall retard. She wins an academy award for being consistently foul, goofy, and murderous. I'm assuming there's a certain amount of sympathy here for an abused from cradle female, but her victims were run of the mill lonely-hearts except for an occasional sadist, but hell why get angry when occupational hazard strikes. Get yourself a lawyer like any worker's occupation case plaintiff Christina Ricci, not in Ghost World, but close, plays Charlize's lover. She's rather retarded too. I can't quite place the blue collar Florida malaise that the audience is supposed to understand instinctively. Well, ah, why didn't lonely Ricci go to beautician school and meet some gals of the same persuasion on line. The whole idea that a down-and-out boozer could even interest this young mixed up girl is hard to swallow. Oh, but this is a true-life story. Never mind.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Average in every way,"Monster aspires to do what Boys Don't Cry has achieved: a human portrayal of a freak. But Monster falls short because it takes itself too seriously and because it is too sentimental. The director stumbles over her own feet trying to make us sympathize with the monster, something that would have been much easier if she wouldn't be breathing down our necks: ""Look, pathos!"" ""To your left, human kindness!"" ""Hey, more good deeds just around that corner!"". Especially the ending suffers from it, because the director raises the emphasis to bring across a sense of urgency and tension. It left me with dry eyes and an empty heart. Charlize Theron certainly did a good effort with her role. But her performance was very uneven at best, wavering between warm femininity and an unconvincing macho attitude. One is left wondering whether she is portraying a gauche character or whether she is having trouble portraying a woman with a male attitude. Certainly it was not an Oscar-worthy performance. If you compare this role to the one portrayed by Hillary Swank, the latter stands out with ease.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Incredible and surprising performance from Theron,"Aileen Wuornos (Charlize Theron) grew up with dreams of stardom. However her childhood is filled with abuse and sexual promiscuity. She falls into prostitution. She's in Florida servicing truckers on the side of the highway. She meets lonely awkward lesbian Selby Wall (Christina Ricci) who is under pressure from her religious father to reject her sexuality. After killing a violent John in self defense, she spirals into a series of killings. The relationship with Shelby deteriorates when she suspects Aileen of the murders.This is a breakout performance from Charlize Theron. She shows that she is better than a simple model-turned-actress. She shows that she has great acting skills. Christina Ricci is a terrific companion. The genius of writer/director Patty Jenkins is to point the camera at Theron. She is allowed to fully express the character as both the victim and as the monster.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Poorly made and dishonest,"Having taken a slight interest in the story of Aileen Wuornos, I was appalled by ""Monster"" because it does no justice to her story. To be fair, Charlize Theron gives a good performance as Wuornos, but after seeing Nick Broomfield's ""The Selling of a Serial Killer"" (1992) I realized just how biased and dishonest the film adaptation ""Monster"" is.Patty Jenkins does have a clear agenda to push which is this: Aileen wasn't a bad person, it was men that made her that way because she was abused by them. It's true, yes, but that doesn't negate what she did -- she still murdered innocent people and ""Monster"" really tries to gloss over some of this.Second of all, my big problem with the film is that it spends so much unnecessary time on the relationship between Aileen and her lover, played by Christina Ricci. It's true, they were involved together, but the movie stops midway to focus on the trials and tribulations -- trying to add depth to the characters -- and fails (or at least it did for me) because I soon lost interest in the ""love story."" In fact this is yet another case of the film glossing over events -- most of the stuff involving the two in this movie is completely made up.I would have preferred a less biased viewpoint on the matter. Although Broomfield's documentary is also very biased (on Channel 4 he even provided a post-chapter where he explains Aileen was just troubled and not aware of what she was doing) it is far more truthful to Aileen's story.Her story is a true American tragedy and to see it glossed over by Hollywood like this, added on top of lies and a biased agenda, is really a shame.A lot of people are going to disagree with me on this but I can't hide my dislike for ""Monster"" and the disappointment I suffered after seeing it.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Grim Portrait Of A Sad, Wasted Life","Let me begin by saying that Charlize Theron gives the best female performance that I have ever seen on film. Theron deservedly won the Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal of serial killer Aileen Wuornos. I can not recall a performance, male or female, with such raw intensity. For those who may not know, MONSTER is the true story of Aileen Wuornos, a Florida prostitute who was executed a couple of years ago for killing men that picked her up on the highway. However, this is much, much more than a deranged serial killer flick. This film shows us, very convincingly, how a person can be led to a life of violence. Aileen had an awful childhood and an awful life. She was molested as a child by her father as well as other male relatives. As a child, she was surrounded by abuse, drug addiction, and domestic violence. Men horribly abused her as a child, and she began prostituting at age thirteen. In her later years, Aileen became a prostitute because it had been grilled into her head all her life that she was just a whore. As MONSTER opens, Aileen's car breaks down and she wanders into what she doesn't know is a gay bar. Sitting alone at a table is lonely, confused lesbian Selby (Christina Ricci), who strikes up a conversation with the dirty, unkempt Aileen, who washes her hair in gas station sinks and uses the hand dryer to fix her hair. After many drinks, Aileen and Selby become close, and soon enter into an unhealthy, torrid, tragic love affair. Selby is naive and has always been sheltered, and she just wants genuine love. However, Aileen has issues that Selby doesn't see at first. There is certainly nothing positive or redeeming about serial killers, but you often feel yourself having a small bit of sympathy for Aileen because you realize why she kills the men who pick her up...SHE HATES MEN. Aileen has always hated men, and the only love scenes in which any tenderness and emotion is shown are the lesbian love scenes between Aileen and Selby. You also feel some sorrow for Aileen because she DOES want to improve herself, but has no way of knowing how to do so. There are scenes where Aileen applies for jobs because she really wants to do right, but she is always rejected. She applies for secretarial jobs at law offices and is laughed right out of the building while she curses and screams at everyone. She doesn't know any better because she has no social skills. In one of the most powerful scenes, Aileen is hitch hiking and is picked up by a genuinely nice man who offers to help her. He is sincere and doesn't want sex. He is a decent man who offers a helping hand, but Aileen just can not trust any man. She tells him she doesn't want to kill him, but because her previous killings are all over the news, she has to kill him so she won't be identified. Selby, meanwhile, learns of Aileen's murderous rampage and tearfully decides to go to the authorities. What makes this film so powerful is that this is A TRUE STORY. Aileen Wuornos had a miserable life. Life dealt her a s@@@@y hand. She never had a chance. Growing up, nobody....teachers, parents, relatives....reached out to her. You can't excuse a serial killer rampage, but this is the only ""serial killer"" film that I have seen that at least offers some reasoning behind the insanity. Again, this is intense, and Charlize Theron is AMAZING.",,Anonymous,Biography
Superb Acting but That's Not Enough to Make a Great Movie,"I have mixed feelings about Monster. First and foremost, Charlize Theron's acting is beyond comprehension in its perfection. She has become Aileen Wuornos (whom she portrays) in a way so intense and so completely it literally scared me. Tour-de-force performances like hers inhabit a realm far above mere mortal efforts: Oscar worthy / Oscar won. Christina Ricci's performance left me cold, though I understand her underplayed / understated performance might have been more in keeping with the facts -- still, it seemed that Charlize Theron owned each and every scene the two of them were in. I suggest a case of bad miscasting / directing / scripting. Secondly, I understand that certain plot points weren't accurate regarding the genesis of the crimes Aileen Wuornos committed...and that's a key to making the character much more sympathetic. If true, then the producers have done the public and the true victims of her crimes an unconscionable disservice. Finally, one has to judge whether the movie was worth watching. It's an uncomfortable ride on many levels. I recommend the movie solely for Charlize Theron's masterful performance and will leave the other aspects of the movie up for your consideration.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Why You Must See This Film,"This film is absolutley amazing, it picks on nearly every single human emotion and brings them all to the surface.  As an audience you're left confused about how you should feel towards this serial killer.   Charlize Theron certainly deserved her best actress Oscar, her performance in this movie was moving, thought-provoking, and truly believable, something I find lacking in many currently released movies.  Behind each emotion expressed on Therons face you see a whole lifetime of pain and anguish in Lee's character, you find yourself knowing her past without it being explained to you.  When watching it's easy to find yourself thinking that you're actually seeing Aileen Wuornos.  Being familiar with the story of Wuornos I feel that Patty Jenkins touched on a hugely sensitive subject, and delivered a story with immense passion.  Whether or not you are familiar with the actual events of Wuornos' destructive 1 year period is irrelevant, as Jenkins and Theron bring a character to life that we all can relate to in someway. The notoriety of the actual story brings the problem of making a charicature of Lee, a problem that Theron has easily side-stepped, showing what an amazing actress she is.  I think that this may be my all time favourite film, or it is certainly heading that way.  This film has everything that a REAL film should have, it doesn't need big stunts, CGIs, $20million-a-movie actors...It's just a brave idea, fuelled by a passion that comes through to the audience.  A truly excellent piece of film-making, and even better acting talents.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
An incomplete portrayal,"While the actors are brilliant and the story depressingly true, it is just a little too slow and doesn't give enough background to sufficiently contextualise the resultant trauma. I found myself googling Aileen and, it seemed, her story was not sufficiently told in this film. Any depth or insight into her very traumatic and sad life was only told through the serial killings, not even her trial warranted any great attention by the film. The film was fixated on the sensational rather than the background grit. As such, given how long the movie is and the slow pace, it seemed this telling of Aileen's story is incomplete and, as a portrayal, did not really do her justice.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the  best in a while,"I found this movie riveting. Charlize Theron turns in a brilliant performance as Aileen - she was unrecognizable. The relationship between the characters is realistically portrayed and the movie gives us some insight into the serial killers motives and mindset. Selby comes off as a weak if loving parter, totally in the dark as to her lovers vicious killings. The innocence of the lovers and ""Lee's"" intense need to be loved form a centerpiece around which the killings seem almost incidental. Theron plays Wuornos as a freaked out victim, raped since a young age and abused all her life. You see her as someone who never really had a chance. The performance is excellent and the intensity of this movie just riveting. I'd see it again and probably will. Highly recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

horrifically disturbing movie,"I watched Monster last night, and it's one of the very few movies that's ever stayed strongly with me this long after it was over. I had trouble sleeping because the movie's scenes kept playing through my mind, and then I woke up early and couldn't get back to sleep because I couldn't stop replaying the horrifically disturbing scenes of Aileen's life as a prostitute.I guess I'll comment briefly on Charlize Theron's performance--everybody else has. It was good, but not as great as I've heard over the past couple years. Her facial make-up sometimes seemed like a mask that obscured her expressiveness, but then again, maybe she was playing it a little dead at times to show the numbness that Aileen sometimes must have felt. OK, I'm not sure this will come out right, but I'm just not really into the idea of a very attractive actress dressing down to play a rather non-attractive woman. In a way, and I don't mean to cheapen this by analogy, but it's kind of like blackface. Here we have Hollywood, where beautiful women get almost all the roles available, and out comes a movie with an amazing role that calls for a woman who's not the gorgeous Hollywood glamor type, and who gets the role? A gorgeous Hollywood glamor type. That's what I mean by the blackface comparison--it's a little like having a movie with roles for black actors and choosing instead to cast white actors with painted faces (although Theron's portrayal was not, in itself, derogatory, unlike blackface). It happens all the time--""need an Arab? cast a dark-skinned Italian."" In Monster, it's, ""need a woman whose life's pain has made its mark on her face and body? cast a woman whose face and body perfectly represent our nation's weirdly skewed ideal of beauty and then make her fatter and, pardon me, uglier."" Just doesn't seem quite fair to me. Perhaps it has something to do with the Academy's penchant to give awards for this kind of role (think of Hilary Swank's role for Boys Don't Cry), and part of it probably also has to do with the fact that Theron was one of the film's producer.Anyway, the film made me feel ill, and that's a good thing in this case. I have a lot of trouble believing that there are so many men who would hire prostitutes along the side of the road (or anywhere else for that matter). Or, rather, I don't want to believe it, but I guess it's sadly not hard to believe. Even more broadly, I think the film is another scathing indictment of a wealthy society that cares so little about its poor, particularly its poor children. I'm not so naively ""liberal"" as to agree that Aileen's character had no choice but to do what she did to survive, but I think it's painfully obvious that the choices available to her were fewer by many orders of magnitude than the choices available to me, or to people of the wealthiest groups in our nation. What can we do to open up more opportunities for the poor, and when will we do it? Good movie, although I hope I never see it again.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Real-life story of a prostitute turned serial killer is realistic and chilling...,"CHARLIZE THERON has to be quite an actress. The only other film I recall seeing her in was GIRL WITH THE PEARL EARRING in which she was quietly subdued, demure, and looked like a charming young woman who stepped out of a masterful painting--a work of art.Here she is as Aileen Wuornos, the serial killer who spent twelve years on Florida's death row convicted of three murders and guilty of how many others, I don't know. I was afraid the film version of her life would show sympathy for the devil, but not so. While it does give you an idea of the hard knocks dealt her from childhood onward, it doesn't justify any of her crimes because of her bitter childhood.Theron completely captures Wuornos, her haggard appearance, her demeanor (mouth twisted in disgust, the darting eyes, the outbursts of raging temper tantrums), and makes the character so completely believable that it's like watching Wuornos, who was viewed after her capture by TV cameras and interviews.Christina RICCI is less impressive as the naive and immature girlfriend, dependent on someone to buy her things so she could ""hang out"" and enjoy life. She comes across as a more limited actress who managed to play a couple of her scenes competently, no more, no less, despite excellent direction from Patty Jenkins.Had a hard time recognizing BRUCE DERN, who looked so much visibly older than I pictured him, that I thought he must be wearing age make-up--I guess I just haven't seen Dern in a film in a long time!A tough film to watch because it doesn't flinch from telling a pretty sordid story that made headlines when Aileen was finally captured and went on trial for her crimes.CHARLIZE THERON definitely deserved her Oscar for playing a very unsympathetic, mentally deranged character and making us feel her pain, as well as the victim's. Especially chilling are scenes involving the last two Johns, neither of whom did anything remotely deserving of the penalty she inflicted on them.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
This is what acting is all about,"Just the most incredible acting I've yet seen from Charlize Theron! This is what true acting is all about! She WAS Aileen Wournos. Monster is one of the most well-put-together movies I have ever seen. It's a pity the story is so tragic. It's not often that a group of people can come together and make a movie that does justice in every way to the subject, perhaps justice is the wrong word, but I felt that by the end of the film nothing more need have been shown or said. Perfect script and I have to say handled perfectly by all concerned. Richly deserves the award attention it received. I'm gushing here I know, sorry but this one really IS a must-see film. If you like to be told a story so well that IT is all you see/hear for 2hrs then this is one for you. It felt like the truth and looked like the truth and after doing some research I found it IS the truth, a real 'based on fact' movie. You have no choice here, love it or hate it you WILL be captivated by Charlize Theron in the lead role.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Monster"" contradicts our tendency to fit each other into the ""good person"" or ""bad person"" binary, precisely by looking deeper into the moral question","At the 2003 Oscars, much was said about Nicole Kidman's prosthetic nose in The Hours, and, when announcing her as the Best Actress of the year, Denzel Washington even commented that she had won ""by a nose"" - a tremendous injustice, since that Kidman delivered a memorable performance in that film. Anyway, if only a fake nose was able to generate so much hype, I wonder what it will be like this year, considering that the beautiful Charlize Theron is absolutely unrecognizable in Monster, in which she plays the serial killer (who really existed) Aileen Wuornos, who killed seven men in 1989 and was executed in 2002.Fourteen pounds heavier and wearing heavy makeup that has aged her over a decade (including dentures, skin blemishes and mistreated hair) and, most importantly, acted on screen like a true troglodyte, moving and talking like the ""monster"". Of the title. The result is so positive that it earned her the coveted Oscar for Best Actress, Theron transforms Wuornos not only into a believable figure, but also into a tragic and moving character, leading the viewer not exactly to forgive, but, at the very least, to understand the causes of their cruel attitudes.A victim of childhood abuse, Aileen Wuornos became a prostitute in her teens, and when Monster begins, she is on the verge of taking her own life. It is then that she meets Selby (Ricci), a young lesbian with whom she ends up getting involved. One night, after being assaulted by a client, Wuornos ends up killing the guy - an incident that, functioning as a true escape valve, becomes routine for the tormented woman, as if she decided to divert all the anger she had always felt from him. Itself towards men who make the mistake of using it as a simple object.Seeking to interpret her own crimes as 'acts of justice', Wuornos is unable to realize the terrible nature of what she is doing - and so when she is confronted by Selby, she confidently states: 'I'm a good person!'. In fact, the relationship between the two women is, without a doubt, the center of the film, which, in a way, works as a love story between two extremely needy, antisocial people with deep emotional scars. It is not wrong to say, by the way, that Wuornos' passion for Selby is the result not of one or more specific attractions of the latter, but of the affectionate way in which the young woman treated him - a delicacy that Aileen had probably never known.It's the first time Lee kills a client, after being beaten and raped by him (in a graphic and cathartic scene: at first, she is crammed into the lower corner of the frame, frightened; then she gets a gun, takes the central position in the frame, frightening, and unloads all the bullets on her attacker), that we see a paradigm shift in the protagonist's possibilities. That, for the first time, opened up an alternative for her: a cruel, violent, unacceptable alternative, but still the first real alternative that had opened up in her entire life. Patty Jenkins was careful enough to show us, in some moments of the film (like when Aileen seeks a formal job and is completely rejected and humiliated), that she tried socially acceptable alternatives, but the situation of prostitution and marginalization she was in was so deeply marked in her personality, in her body, in her life, that it was not possible to get out of it.However, and therein lies the merit of the film, the director does not aim to exonerate Lee of his guilt or, at the other extreme, treat her as a monster with psychopathic instincts, but rather to show how complex her personality is, and how each action takes place in a specific context. In another voice-over, this time shortly after the character carried out her second murder, which was definitely not in self-defense like the first, Aileen tells about a Ferris wheel from her childhood that, so big, was called ""Monster"". She was so frightened by the wheel ride that she threw up, and she relates this episode to a trend in her life: the most harmless (a park toy, in this case) always scared her the most, while doing what looked horrible was easier than doing it. What it looked like.In addition to making the connection with the title, this little story has a lot to say about how Jenkins portrays Aileen's morals at that moment: not as someone who was incapable of doing the right thing, but someone who, when reaching a critical point and being forced to to choose between the ""harmless"" act of calling the client ""daddy"" and not doing so, he finds it easier to kill him. There is no judgment as to whether that would be the ""best"" choice or even the ""right"" choice, but rather an ""easier"" choice: and how many times have we not chosen the ""easy"" instead of the ""right"", even if, in our contexts, the consequences were not so serious or the acts so extreme? Again, I reiterate that Jenkins' intention is not to justify the unjustifiable act of killing another human being, but to reflect on how the character's psychological process takes place in the face of the lack of alternatives given by society.Thus, ""Monster"" is a film that boldly delves deep into very difficult ethical questions, such as the nature of guilt - which is unraveled in two key scenes, one when Aileen tells Selby that she is a good person, and the other. Another in the film's third act, in a speech by Tom (Bruce Dern) about life in prostitution being forced on Lee and the fact that she never had a choice. In the latter, Tom brings up the fact that she ""needs to live"" ""but you gotta live"", despite all the guilt she carries about something that, according to him, she had no control over. Of course, he did not yet know that she had been killing her last clients: but what he says relates, for us and for her, also to the murders, for that was the way she found the easiest to ""go on living""., that is, to survive.Played by the ever-competent Christina Ricci, Selby is a fictionalized version of Tyria Moore, the woman who in real life shared her sufferings with Aileen. The character was created because Tyria had been portrayed in a negative light in a documentary about the killer and decided to sue the producers of the tape. Since Monster is exactly what you see on screen, the studio chose to remove it to avoid further accusations. Thus, the character was only partially true, which does not take away her strength.Indulging fully in their roles, Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci star in a terrifyingly unhealthy relationship, in which Selby encourages Aileen to continue in prostitution in order to support her. Spoiled and self-indulgent, the girl goes so far as to turn a blind eye to the crimes committed by her lover in order to avoid a confrontation that could destroy the 'balance' of the marriage. On the other hand, Aileen seems to use (to a certain extent) her 'cause' as a mere excuse to get the money that will guarantee Selby's stay by her side.However, although the dynamic between the two protagonists is well developed by the script by Patty Jenkins (who also debuts in the direction of feature films), the fact is that Monster ends up attributing excessive weight to Selby when studying the reasons that turned Aileen Wuornos in a serial killer. The film ignores, for example, important elements of Wuornos' life, such as her marriage (she was even arrested for beating her husband, who is never mentioned in the story) and her father's pedophilia. As a result, the project ends up romanticizing the killer's actions, caring little for her victims (only one of the men killed by her is portrayed positively).Ultimately, ""Monster"" contradicts our tendency to fit each other into the ""good person"" or ""bad person"" binary, precisely by looking deeper into the moral question, recognizing the vast gray spectrum between our black-and-white vision. -white, and when questioning what leads a person, in the end, to make the decision to perform a ""good deed"" or a ""bad deed"". This is, in itself, a feature that makes the film stand out among other productions: first, because it does not try to make its protagonist a ""victim"" or a ""villain"", escaping from the common stereotypes when it comes to works about serials. Killers or other types of criminals; second, because it recognizes that the viewer will cast judgments on what it sees, and, by not endorsing or contradicting those judgments, it turns a mirror on the viewer itself and asks, ""And what would you do or feel if you were in a similar situation?""",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

The American Monster,"This is the desperate story of a woman whose child-abused background led her to teenage prostitution and a disgust with herself and humankind before she reached 30, and then, desperate to keep the spurious affection and shabby love, however ill-judged and unbalanced, of an immature, lonely, and rather stupid lesbian, she turns into a serial killer. Based on the life of Aileen Wournos, Patty Jenkins and Charlize Theron have achieved not only a film of excellence and importance, but of a depth and darkness that takes your breath away. Charlize Theron's brilliant, bravura performance, Christine Ricci's impressive supporting acting, Patty Jenkins's direction, and the structure and script, make Monster an impressive film. Despite the depressing themes, all the more accentuated by sad motel rooms, low-life bars, and dismal highway nights when Wournos is seeking clients - and victims - the film is so strong on characterisation and with a script which rings true at every stage (despite some difficulty in understanding the mumbled dialogue between the two leads at times), it leaves a lasting impression of ineffable sadness.The film works on many levels and the bottom line is a thorough indictment of the dark side of American society. The monster is American society which can produce, through ignorance, prejudice, abusive behaviour, easy gun-license laws, the death penalty, and so on, the kind of people which Aileen and Selby become. They are extreme examples, of course, but the message is clear. And this film does have a message even though it takes pains not to be judgmental. At the centre of the film, when Aileen confesses her first murders to Selby, she says she is okay with the Lord, it is the society that brought her up, the politics and the religion, that made her what she was. If politics and religion justify so many killings, her own killings are justified (as a way of compensating for the rapes, abuse, the inevitable prostitution, leading to more abuse and rape and hatred of men as well as herself). Her logic may be questionable but her point is well made.I have noticed a recent succession of movies which focus on lesbian killers and the lesbian lead always ends up badly. Is it no longer valid to make film with a heterosexual female aggressor? Do those women have to remain passive, or victims, or at least equal with the men they are teamed with, but the lesbian is still 'the bad guy'. Thelma and Louise were not portrayed as lesbians (although they still had to come to a sticky end because of their crimes), but since then there is a noticeable trend in Hollywood to recognise these lesbian themed movies by giving the leading actresses Oscars - Frances McDormand in Fargo, Hilary Swank in Boys Don't Cry, and now Charlize Theron in Monster. (However, Monster knocks Boys Don't Cry and Fargo into insignificance.)I wonder about the motives of Hollywood. The film world may pay lip-service to liberal tolerance of female homosexuality by recognising these actress performances, but the overall impression is that lesbians are not good people and I question that audiences will be encouraged to see lesbians as acceptable members of society, given the film examples in front of them.So, to me, this film was not so much a feminist polemic as a depressing, but gripping, story about alienation and isolation, told in a way which can't help but leave the viewer asking a lot of questions about a society which creates such 'monsters'. Aileen is simply the flip-side of the American dream and, as such, turns the dream extremely sour.",,Anonymous,Biography

"In addition to having an extraordinary Charlize Theron, the film exudes realism and rudeness.","Directed by Patty Jenkins, this darkly named film is about the life and criminal course of Aileen Wuornos, a prostitute who became a serial killer who killed her clients. I do not know the life of the true criminal strictly, so I am not the best person to judge whether the film is true to the facts, but I believe that numerous concessions have been made to creative and dramatic freedom. However, it is not a horror movie as it could be, nor is it a simple police thriller. What we have here is a very human film, deeply dramatic, and in a way, I felt, gives a human soul to a criminal who, in a different film, would have been converted into a character without any soul.In fact, the script was able to use the drama to emphasize all the humanity of the main character. Aileen is shown as a woman who started selling her body when she was young and by pure necessity, but ended up being ostracized by everyone, abandoned by her own family (a totally unstructured family) and had no more opportunities to leave the streets, leaving herself to the whims and brutality of customers, who were mostly rude men. The harshness of life made her what she was, and cruelty led her to lose confidence in men. The crimes she committed were the way of fighting back, and it is not by chance that the only affective connection in which the character really gets involved is with another woman, a young woman that she still feels has the purity that she herself has already lost, and that she admires because of that.Charlize Theron is one of those actresses that you don't normally think about much when you need someone capable of deeply employing a character and giving her charisma, strength and depth. I, at least, didn't see it that way until I saw this movie. It was a surprise the way Theron grabbed the character and boldly transformed himself into her. The actress achieved what, for me, is her biggest and most complete dramatic work and deserved the Oscar for Best Actress that she won at the 2004 ceremonies. Beside her, the young but talented Christina Ricci gave life to a more restrained role, and that ends up being a little forgotten because of the spectacular work of the protagonist. And if she ends up in the shadows herself, what about the secondary cast? They are totally reduced to figuration. This film was carried on the back by Theron, with merit and praise.Being a film so focused on the main character and the overwhelming performance of the actress that gave it body, the technical aspects end up a little in the background. However, they deserve a positive note, especially with regard to cinematography, with an elegantly done filming and editing job and realistic crimes without abuse of effects and fake blood. The makeup and costume work is also good, in that it exudes reality and emphasizes the harshness and risk of those who work in street prostitution. With regard to Theron, it is worth highlighting the way in which her facial and physical appearance was altered for the character. Everything else is used with discretion, not to say parsimony, from the effects of light and shadow to the soundtrack.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Phenomenal performance from almost unrecognisable Theron.,"It's rare that I feel the best actress Oscar is ""won"" by the most deserving recipient but Charlize' performance unquestionably was the best of that year and arguably any other year.For even an established character actress to have pulled this off would be one thing but for a Hollywood pretty-girl to have done so beggars belief.Where did Charlize get it from? I'm assuming that her personal history was a factor - I believe her mother killed her violent father in self-defence - correct me if i'm wrong - so she perhaps knows something of the life of Aileen Wournos.If you haven't already I suggest that you see Nick Broomfields two documentaries on the same subject to see how perfectly Theron nailed Aileens aggressive yet vulnerable persona and for further background.It's an incredibly sad film as well and though the film doesn't spread it on too thick how Aileens loveless childhood created the ""monster"" you can't help but agree in this case that Aileen was created and not born ""evil"" and hopefully feel as i did immense sympathy for her and the trail of almost accidental death that for a few brief moments allowed Aileen to avenge the despicable treatment in her life but then led to her own betrayal by her girlfriend and ultimate demise.Once again - an astonishing display by Theron.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Anti Death Penalty movie,"Charlize Theron did an excellent job in the movie Monster and in my opinion deserves to be awarded the best actress award. My problem with the movie is that the majority of the focus of the movie was portraying her as the victim in a love relationship with another female. Sprinkled in the film was Charlize's character killing men as a prostitute for a few dollars. This was a movie based on a true story where Charlize's character was executed in Florida for all of her murders. In my opinion, whomever directed and produced this movie was trying to show the human side of murder and that she did not deserve the death penalty.

The real Monster of this movie?  The soundtrack! Hooooooooh!,"Okay, seriously, i needed a bit of comedy before reviewing this dark, serious movie about murder and human nature.""Monster"", as most of you know, is the story of serial killer Aileen Wuornos, physically ugly; abused as a child, living as a prostitute, falling in love with another woman, and killing men.  An upbeat film this is not.As much has been said about Theron's performance as Aileen, I won't comment too much.  I will, however, make the joke that she got an oscar just for looking ugly!  Seriously though, she doesn't just look like Lee, but she lives and breathes as Lee.  Just watching the littlest facial quirk, the way she holds and moves her body, all I could think of wasn't who was playing her or how amazing the make up was, but just about the character.  That's why she's so good in this. The rest of the cast is okay, with Christina Ricci playing against type as a needy lesbian who stands by and allows Lee to kill, becoming something of a monster herself.Another thing to comment on, is that this isn't called ""Monster"" because Godzilla's in it.  My friends and I commented that there were maybe 2 nice people in the entire film.  This movie is dark and depressing.  Now, we've got a macabre sense of humor, but after seeing this, it took a while for some jokes to seem funny again.Of course, this leads into just how realistic is the movie to life and the events surrounding it?  Some people have claimed that the film misinterprets some of the victims, and that it over-sympathizes with Lee.  And then there's what I said about there being maybe 2 redeemable human beings in the whole thing, with self-righteous religious stereotypes in it as well.I believe the movie is that way for a purpose.  I can't defend the misinterpreting of some of the victims, but other things I can.  Notice how the film is narrated from Lee's point of view.  And since it's from her messed up, murderous point of view, wouldn't most of humanity seem irredeemable?  And wouldn't she play us, the audience, her jury, for sympathy?This movie is so successful because when I left the theater, I was made because I figured I had just seen another psycho-liberal movie bashing religious people and the death sentence, among other things.  But as I left and talked with others, I realized that that's how I'm SUPPOSED to feel: the movie is told from Lee's point of view, of her trying to justify her horrible actions by making people see her view of how bad the world is and how much a victim she is.  The filmmakers want me to get mad at her, to not agree with her.  If they didn't, if the filmmakers really wanted people to feel sorry for Lee, they wouldn't have called it ""Monster"".  Looking back on it, i see how the directing, the writing, and the few really innocent people in the film were put there to make me feel a certain way.  Excellently done! They were so successful I didn't notice until long after the movie was over.That said, aside from being depressing enough to bring down a guy high on ecstasy, the movie's main flaw is the music.  The orchestral music is okay, but some of the songs, like the one they play when Lee and Selby are cuddling, made me want to kill someone!  And the guitar sound that starts to play before their tastefully shot sex scene sounded like 70's porn music, i kid you not.  But man, if that was meant to be funny, i sure needed it, because nothing else in this movie is a laughing matter.Alltogether, sorry Lee, but I only empathize with you.  I would probably found you guilty as well.  If the way you were treated by the first guy was accurate in the film, and you had turned yourself in, I'd have found you not-guilty, it being self defense.  But you couldn't stop, or wouldn't, and tried to hide it.  Besides, lots of people who do get raped and abused as kids don't go out and kill.""Monster"" is an incredibly, subtly effective film, but definitely not for the faint of heart.  It's more ""Henry"" than ""Hannibal"".  But, for those who can take it, or enjoy studying the darker aspects of humanity in a serious light, gather your courage and see ""Monster"".",,Anonymous,Biography
Charlize Theron's Tour De Force,"This is a wonderful portrayal of an interesting story.  Female serial killers are rare and the plot does a good job of a balanced portrayal of a complex woman.

After I watched it though, I watched the documentary about Aileen Wournos and in it she said she never got raped, she just made it up. So maybe they just ignored that part to make a better movie. Which is terrible. But I do believe she was abused and molested as a child so I am not surprised she ended up where she did.

"We can be as different as we wanna be, but you can't kill people!","Monster is the bleak story of Aileen Wuornos, a prostitute and one of America's most notorious female serial killers. Based around facts of her life and death, the film primarily focuses on the last year of her freedom. Where after entering into a strange lesbian relationship with Selby Wall, Wuornos, fed up of being a abused by men, starts killing those calling on her services.Sad and potent is Patty Jenkins' first full length directorial effort. Though perhaps a touch guilty of pandering to Wuornos' own self created ""monster"" image, the film none the less has the right blend of sympathy and revulsion to make it a fascinating, if uneasy, experience. Former model Charlize Theron goes through a major transformation to become Wuornos, so much so she's practically unrecognisable. Bulked up in weight and with beaten down make up withering her face, Theron goes on to give a towering performance as the troubled, on the edge killer.Without any thrills or hints of histrionics, Theron is uncompromising throughout the picture. To garner empathy with such an abrasive character is quite a trick, then to switch to monstrosity with conviction seconds later? Well that's almost magical in itself. Theron is backed up well by Christina Ricci as Selby. Selby Wall, an immature young lady oblivious to the dark path she is walking down, is given a great portrayal from Ricci. In light of the powerhouse show from Theron, it's much credit to Ricci that she enhances the film with her own delicate characteristics. Helping to emphasise the strangeness of the union in the process.It's a tough film for sure, and come the final credits one is left with a feeling of sympathy towards Wuornos and the life she lived. If that be right or wrong is of course up to the individual viewer. Or if that was even Jenkins' intention is probably up for debate. But Monster exists and survives as a bitter character study of a desperate woman, which through the medium of cinema, makes us the viewers privy to something very edgy indeed. 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Excellent,"Even now, eleven years after 'Monster' was first released, it's still difficult to comprehend that that's Charlize Theron you're watching. We all know that it's her of course, but it's still hard to reconcile the wild eyed, jittery and aggressively-defensive woman at the centre of this film with the glamorous Hollywood starlet we're used to. What's even more remarkable is that despite being a violent, foul-mouthed and unhinged lunatic who winds up killing several people, Theron still manages to make Aileen Wuornos a sympathetic character. She does some terrible things, but you'll still feel sorry for her come the closing credits. It's a masterful performance and that Oscar was well deserved.A single terrific performance doesn't make a movie however and even if it were a different actress in the lead role, 'Monster' would still be an excellent movie. It tells the story of a woman who became a prostitute at the age of 13, never escaped it and eventually grew into a gun-totting serial killer who would pick up men at the roadside, then murder them to steal their cars and money. It's a film about life at the bottom rung of society and is mercilessly harrowing in its depiction of life in the gutter. There are scenes of rape and murder, some devastatingly un-erotic sexual encounters and there's more chance of Godzilla turning up than a Richard Gere shaped Knight In Shining Armour.And yet, 'Monster' still has moments of warmth and humour. Aileen's rather misguided attempts at pursuing a new career lead to a few unexpected laughs, while her roller-disco kiss with her lesbian lover Selby is remarkably touching. There's also a brief but moving appearance by Bruce Dern as Aileen's only real friend and his speech about survival is one of the great understated moments of the film.Plus, there's Christina Ricci as Selby who plays off against Theron admirably. Where Aileen is loud and confrontational, Selby is shy, quiet and for the most part rather sweet. She also gets rather petulant at times and Ricci manages to just about convince that she can remain innocent while begging Aileen to start prostituting herself for money again. What's more, they have a natural chemistry and do genuinely seem to love one another, even when screaming at each other in alcohol fuelled frustration.In other words,this is an excellent film. Theron gives the performance of her career and the film does a remarkable job shining a light on the grubby underbelly of modern society. Prostitutes, alcoholics, junkies and vagrants all exist and while 'Monster' doesn't exactly make them seem noble, it does humanise them. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sympathy for the devil,"Though this film is brutally honest about Aileen 'Lee' Wuornos' crimes it does provoke some sympathy for her. Yes, she does kill many people (all men) but when you consider how many men battered her and raped her all through her life, even as a child, it's no surprise she became so psychotic.And I don't think it's exactly fair that she got the death penalty. Surely it would have been best to help a woman who lived her entire existence in the dregs of society (which is surely to blame for sending her mad) than executing her.Focusing entirely on Lee instead of the police investigations following her (there is a TV movie from the mid-90s that does exactly this if you're more interested), we see her straggle from thinking about suicide, hooking up with lonely, naive Selby (Christina Ricci), killing in self-defense and finally killing for revenge/money.Charlize Theron completely vanishes as she brings her take on Lee (her full name is never mentioned in the film) to the screen. She sure deserved her Academy Award and Christina Ricca (who is very cute here) is also very good. However, for a lesbian couple I just didn't see any real feeling between them. It annoyed me how fast the film moved and there are not really many quiet moments for these two characters to bond in any way. Yes, they proclaim their love for each other but I just didn't see it. There was too much shouting and screaming.There are no surprises in the film, as we all know how it ends anyway. But some of Lee's killings are harsh, compelling and even ironic. The overall effect of the film isn't so long-lasting on me though.It's shot and lit like a TV movie and Lee's heavy judgment at the end of the film is played down. For a film that is slightly biased to her point of view it's annoying that her unfair trial and life are not exploited just a little bit more for us to gain a little extra insight into the making of a 'monster'.Keep a lookout for Kane Hodder as an undercover cop near the end.The DVD is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby/DTS 5.1 sound and some slight extras.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Blah, blah, blah.....","Charlize Theron puts on a masterful fictional performance. And as pure fiction, this might be compelling. But it is not. This was a real woman that was a useless psychopath who chose her life of prostitution, murder and mayhem. What is presented as real life is nothing more than pretentious clap-trap and revisionist pablum. The men she killed and the families that suffered as a result are not represented or even considered. Yet somehow the ridiculous yahoos that run Hollywood decided her life was worth sharing, even immortalizing...What a waste of my time...Yet having said all that, if stories that disturb you are of interest, this is a compelling watch. Still, I'm annoyed for having had to sit threw it, and even more disturbed than ever of what passes for taste and culture by those in the entertainment industry.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Unpleasant and very little fun to watch but, despite some slips, it is a strong film and fair dramatisation of the story that is tragic, depressing and has nothing that will uplift you in any way","Aileen Wuornos is a drifter and low rent prostitute. Turning up in a gay bar to spend her last $5 before killing herself brings about a chance meeting with the young and pretty Selby, trying to work out her own sexuality. While turning tricks for enough money for a motel, Aileen experiences a violent John, who she kills in response to a brutal rape attempt. With the money and the car she takes from him, Aileen takes Selby away with her for a life of partying and fun but, when the money runs out and the chances for real employment amount to zero, Aileen goes back out on the street. However faced with one more penis to sick, Aileen kills her John, starting a violent cycle of murder.A few months ago I saw Nick Broomfield's follow up documentary on Wuornos in which he followed her appeal and then her final days, hours and minutes before her death sentence was carried out. From that viewpoint I was left with no doubt that Wuornos was in no fit mental state to be executed even though she killed those men in cold blood  I suggest you see it for yourself because it is a film that will shake you deep about your sense of justice. Seeing Monster after that film puts me in a strange position where I felt that the film was unsure whether or not it felt sympathy for Aileen or judged her. I think it was a strength of the writing that it didn't seek to totally excuse or to condemn and ended up somewhere in the middle  acknowledging the totally sh*t life she had but never excusing her murders or making them less than the cold blooded executions that they were. In trying to dramatise this story the film just about manages to do it well, producing a film that is tragic, violent, idealistic and repulsive in equal measures. Occasionally I did wonder why I was watching such a bleak, depressing story when I'd already heard it from the woman herself, but it was worth it overall.The main criticism I would have was that Jenkins was making a dramatisation of this story, not a totally true one  so we don't know how brutally she was beaten that caused her to kill, nor do we know if she really wept and struggled to kill some of her victims; these are things that are added to the character that we can't be sure of, but I didn't feel they were over the top. As director, Jenkins is much better; she frames her shots well and she directs with style but without making it flashy over too obvious  some shots are so sparse and bleak that I felt they captured the tone really well. Of course the film is carried by a massive performance from Theron who, looks, sounds and acts just like the Wuornos that I have seen on the documentaries. So often trading on her looks and denied good roles, she takes to this with total enthusiasm and she thoroughly deserved the Oscar that she got for it. Ricci is equally as good but obviously is in the shadows for most of the film. Her character was never really explained and was treated more as our way in by Jenkins as opposed to being a major part of the story and the murders. Minor roles for Dern and Vince add interest but I did have to wonder why either of them were happy to accept such minor roles  certainly Vince is a much better actor and too well known to be given a role of 'John #5' and be given a hand job.Overall this is a powerful film that avoids swinging one way or another, although it is evident that, at times, Jenkins did find herself coming down on the side of Wuornos at some points  but happily never too heavily. The story is unpleasant and it is no fun to watch no matter what your view of the outcome is. It is greatly helped by two great performances, especially Theron, who I seriously doubt will ever get a role this good again.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Good work here, but a really depressing film.","What a depressing movie. Yes, there were a lot of things done very well in this, but overall it is a real downer. Charlize Theron did what everyone says she did. But all the wonderment at her uglifying herself for this role overshadows the performance by Christina Ricci, who turned in an excellent piece of work herself. She must be taken seriously as a dramatic actress now. Patty Jenkins' direction was good inasmuch as she never called attention to herself. Kudos also to Annie Corley in a small role.A word about Aileen Wuornos. It is too bad that she had such a terrible life. But lots of people have terrible lives and yet do not go on killing sprees. While one may come to understand her a little better from watching this film, she was nonetheless someone to be despised, and upon whom justice was properly served.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
More than just the bio of a killer,"Monster is the true story of Aileen Carol Wuornos, a prostitute in Florida who murdered seven men in the late eighties and early nineties.Based on the title of the movie, and knowing somewhat of what the movie was about, I watched this film expecting a rather brutal depiction of the actions committed by a serial killer. While it does go into detail of some of the killings and what led to them, it's more than just a recount of a killing spree. It's mainly a love story, with a very depressing theme to it.Aileen (played by Charlize Theron, who did an AMAZING job) meets a younger girl, Selby (played by Christina Ricci, also a fantastic performance), and the two eventually fall in love. While they appear to be complete opposites, they share two characteristics: a sense of rejection from the world, and a desire to be accepted by others. Selby, a lesbian coming from a very strict religious family, and Aileen, who suffered from an abusive childhood, were both looked down upon by those around them.The movie makes little attempt to portray Aileen as a monster as the title might suggest. Instead, it displays a different perspective of Wuornos' life. We get to see the human side of Aileen. However, the film in no way tries to condone the murders, but instead goes to show that they weren't simply the result of an evil mind. When not killing people, Aileen appears to be a decent, though short tempered human being.This film effectively tries to show you that sometimes you can be placed in a horrible situation against your will, and that you might have no say in these life-altering events. Aileen, though a murderer, was not someone who decided one day to get up and start killing people. She was severely abused as a child, destroying her self-confidence at a very early age, and effectively crushing any chance she might have had at a decent, normal life.Monster is a beautiful and depressing drama with superb acting. A movie that can make you feel sympathetic for a serial killer, without glorifying the murders, is a truly effective one I believe. I think this fact intimidates some people, who might not actually WANT to feel pity or sympathy for a person who committed these crimes. I gave this movie a ten, though I'm not sure if it deserves one, I wanted to try and help raise the average as it certainly deserves more than a 7.4.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Criminals are people too,"A fairly attractive Charlize Theron plays a grossly unattractive Aileen Wuornos, a prostitute that murdered some of her johns. When the movie was being previewed and talked about before it hit theaters I saw Charlize Theron on a talk show promoting the movie. At that time I had no idea who Charlize Theron was. The talk show showed a picture of Theron in the movie compared to her normal look. All I could say was: Wow!!! The transformation was astonishing. I don't know how much make up they had to put on her (or take off of her) to get her to look the way she did, but to complete the amazement, she also gained weight for the film.I watched the movie on T.V. and Theron not only went through great lengths to look the part, but she did a helluva job acting the part too. To transform from a dainty, attractive Hollywood icon to an overweight, foul mouth, masculine prostitute, was just awesome. On top of that, the movie was good. Criminals are people too. Aileen's story was not particularly unique, but her character coupled with her lifestyle was compelling. I am interested in the minds and lives of criminals. I'd never want to be a criminal myself, and I don't even condone of criminal behavior, but like the scientist or the psychologist, I like to know what makes them the way they are.Aileen, was an interesting case and an interesting person. She was a homeless wandering soul, looking for money, looking for love, looking for a suitable life. She found a person of interest in Selby (Christina Ricci) and they shared a life together briefly before Aileen's criminal actions caught up with her. They were almost reminiscent of Thelma & Louise in that they were on the road & somewhat on the run, and all they had and all they could trust was each other. Aileen's story, and in fact Aileen herself, was compelling.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Charlize? Great.  Everything else? eh.,"In this less than thrilling story about the killing spree of Aileen Carol Wuornos, director Patty Jenkins gives the audience just under two hours of standard film- making.   Monster has no real energy.  With the exception of the power ofCharlize Theron's portrayal of Aileen, the film is empty and tiresome. Christina Ricci's performance is o.k. but looks of delight and allure are so reminiscent of Wednesday Addams that she never really creates a solid conception of hercharacter for audiences that have enjoyed her work in the past.Monster is one of those movies that you see for a performance by a brilliant rising star.   Beyond that, the film seems true enough to the real story but wholly uninteresting.   To complicate matters, the screenplay villifies and sympathizes with the plight of the two ladies.  Normally the groundwork for a great film, it fails in monster simply because it doesn't build enough interest around thesupporting characters and the circumstances of the lives of Aileen and Selby.See it once for Theron's performance then forget about it.  Likely to beremembered for Theron's first Statuette but that's it.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Who are the victims?,"I watched this movie recently after seeing Nick Broomfield's Docu, The Death Of A serial Killer. After reading a lot of user comments,most of which I agreed with,ie.that this is a very fine film, albeit lacking in some areas.What I am surprised with, is only a few contributors are making any reference to Aileen's state of mind at this stage in her life. I don't condone murder, capital or otherwise and surely this woman's fate was to serve her time in a facility for the criminally insane. I for one, am of the opinion that Aileen had lost her mind and was clearly insane at the time she was committing this heinous crimes. I was very impressed with this film. Theron was spellbinding in the lead and fair play to Ricci, I thought her performance was top drawer. Patty Jenkins has to be commended on a wonderful directorial debut and portrayed some very emotive and contraversal issues with poise and balance. The question for me was exactly who are the victims in this film? The only answer that makes any sense to me, apart from the obvious, is that Aileen had died a long time before these murders ever took place. Surely society as a whole must take a little responsibility for letting people as vunerable as this fall through any form of safety net. Enough said, I rate this movie as one of the best I've seen in a while and would have no hesitation in recommending it.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Crimson, Clover and Creepy","Greetings again from the darkness.  Tough docudrama on convicted serial killer Aileen Wournos.  Director Patty Jenkins aims to present a character study on one of the few female serial killers in US history.  This is a well-known story without much mystery, just plenty of anguish.  ""Lee"" had a miserable childhood that just developed into prostitution for survival. Shows what can happen when you have no love or compassion.  We get a glimpse of her teen years when she so desperately wanted someone to take a liking to her, but she simply lacked the social skills to allow this to happen. Charlize Theron is mesmerizing and unrecognizable as Wournos.  The combination of weight gain, make-up and mannerisms bring Wournos to life - she becomes this messed up human being longing for companionship.  Her relationship with the coniving ""Shelby"" (Christina Ricci) is almost as painful to watch as the killings.  This film is not easy to watch, but Theron's performance makes it a must for film lovers.  Check out the nice supporting roles from Pruitt Taylor Vince, Scott Wilson and veteran (and rarely seen) Bruce Dern.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Different Kind of Love Story,"While IMHO ""Monster"" is an absolutely amazing film, it obviously is not going to be everyone's cup of tea. But the only reasons for criticism are writer/director Patty Jenkins' exploitation of a real-life situation and the perception that serial killer Aileen is portrayed as more of a victim that those she murdered. While there is some logic to those arguments, I think Jenkins actually showed considerable restraint. Exploitation and character identification are inevitable in this type of story. It is more a question of degree-if you compare this to 1990's tearjerker ""Too Young to Die"" (starring Juliette Lewis in an almost identical story), Jenkins comes off as a model of objectivity and distanced perspective.What is most unique and compelling about ""Monster"" is that it is much more a love story than a thriller or a crime drama. The two main love scenes are absolutely riveting, with intensity levels higher than you are likely to find in any other film. ""Tide Is High"" and ""Crimson and Clover"" will never sound the same.One thing that works unexpectedly well is the incredible contrast between the two characters. Jenkins works hard to emphasize this, with camera shots that emphasize the physical size differences coupled with dialogue and behaviors that emphasize the contrasting personalities of this odd pair. Having Scott Wilson play the last murder victim is a homage to an earlier ""Mutt and Jeff"" pair of murderers, as he played Robert Blake's ""In Cold Blood"" sidekick.Although most of the critical acclaim has gone to Theron for her portrayal of Aileen, I think that a lot of the credit for Theron's masterful performance should go to Ricci's subtle and nuanced portrayal of Selby. Watch Ricci's eyes in all her reaction shots, it is as close to acting for the camera perfection as you are likely to ever see.If you really enjoyed Theron's incredible transformation from her typical hot starlet to this gritty prostitute role, then check out Catherine Deneuve in ""Repulsion"" (1965) and ""Belle de jour"" (1967). While not as physically extreme as Theron's transformation, Deneuve's two characters are equally hard to reconcile as being played by the same actress. Yet another acting for the camera marvel, as wardrobe, makeup, and hair-styling combine with behaviors and speech to effect an amazing range between two characters played by the same actress.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"All they wanted was to get off, instead they got off'd...","Sorry, I make jokes that I think are great it's just that most other people don't.So I watch a few docs about this case and have a pretty good mental image of Aileen. Fast forward a few years and I am looking for movies I haven't seen and Monster pops up. I couldn't believe that was Charlize for one but since I knew it was I was amazed at how good of a transformation they did with her. More than the physical resemblance Charlize nailed Aileen's mannerisms. That women is one complex nutter so I give Charlize two thumbs up.I think you need to go in to this movie knowing that the story is gruesome and sad. I also really suggest you watch some video clips or even a documentary on the case so you can appreciate how great Charlize does. For me her portrayal was 80% of what interested me about the movie. To be honest I can see why the movie didn't get many awards. The dialogue felt clunky to me and often I feel like they didn't take enough artistic discretion in making it more suspenseful and adding more emotional peaks and valleys to keep interest.My bottom line is that the acting is great, dialogue is not, cinematography was okay, and the story is gruesome. And Charlize is a baller.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Sympathy for the Devil,"This is a tough movie. Which is good, because it should be tough. In fact, movies like this should be almost unwatchable. We watch these films though, because we are human, and we are interested. Things we don't understand fascinate us. People in situations we have never been in, people doing things we cannot imagine ourselves doing - we watch and we wonder - what would i do here? Could i ever act like that give the right circumstances? Would i sell my body if it was the only way to survive? Could i kill a man who attacked me? Could i fall into a gay relationship? And i suppose the most compelling thing is that, thank God - most of us never have to find out, so we begin to enjoy the drama and the unknown of what we are watching. And this is a dramatic and gripping movie. There is no doubt in my mind that it is a movie made with care and made well. I was glued as i'm sure millions were. And i think again, that this is all fine and good and healthy. The problem i have with movies about real life people who do terrible things is this... I found myself being so unbelievably impressed by the performance given by Charlize Theron, that i soon forgot about the real Aileen Wuornos, the woman i'd watched in the documentary 'Life and Death of a Serial Killer' who stayed with me for days after watching, images of her and bits of things she had said were trapped in my head. She terrified me and yet i found her story heartbreaking. Ahe appalled me and yet i wanted to understand her and look within myself to see reason for the things she did. But i could not - not by looking inward - I have never been abused, i have never been raped, i have not suffered even a tiny extent of the things she did. I cannot understand a woman like that - i can feel for her and i can be angered and shocked by the things she experienced, but it would be ignorant and foolish to say 'i understand'. Charlize Theron's portrayal of Aileen is so good that after watching Monster, i found things began to get muddy. I felt like i did understand. I could look within myself and see why things happened the way they did. I felt that i now understood Aileen better, that i knew her now, i could see what sort of person she was and i could now feel sympathy for her, perhaps even empathy. But now, on reflection, i suspect that this is not really the case. I was, in all honesty, seeing Theron. She plays this part so well that it is almost impossible to see where Aileen ends and Charleze begins which from a dramatic and cinematic perspective is quite an achievement, but although the character is made real, and believable and has been carefully studied, it is not real. Aileen Wuornos is not an 'impressive' woman. Be impressed by Theron, by all means, but before casting opinions of right and wrong, see the real woman. And then try to decide how you feel.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Heavy drama,"A gripping, gruelling, story of a highway prostitute who becomes a serial killer and one of the most powerful films of the year. The performance by the heavily transformed (normally gorgeous) Charlize Theron into the rather scary overweight Aileen is an all-time great. Christina Ricci also adds notches to her promising career, this time as a convincing teenage lesbian, enthralled by the older woman, and deeply in love until she realises she's run off with a mentally unbalanced murderer. Theron's character is based on a true life story (the subject of two separate film documentaries) - perhaps the emotional power lies in the sympathy the audience feels for her for quite a long time - a sort of, ""if only something good could happen once in her miserable life, just one ray of light, surely she deserves a chance . .."". Be warned, it contains very disturbing scenes, including extreme sexual violence. It's a pretty depressing tale, convincingly seen from the point of view of someone who's life has little or no hope.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great acting.Objectionable content.,"I knew before viewing this film that I would find the majority of the content objectionable,so I was not surprised in that regard.What drew me to the film was the obvious pouring of heart and soul by Charlize Theron into this project that was evident in previews and interviews.Theron's portrayal of this tortured soul is nothing short of dead on.It is worth viewing for this fact alone.Theron was so immersed in character that she is purely non recognizable.You almost forget that this isn't the real Aileen Wuornos you are seeing.Though Theron might have been able to carry the film on her own,she is offered great support by Christina Ricci and the always credible Bruce Dern.It's a good film,not so much through content,but through the performance of the cast.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Absolutely heart breaking!,"This film is based on the true life story of highway prostitute turned serial-killer, Aileen Wuornos. Charlize Theron playes Wuornos, one of life's damaged people, she is jaded about life, down to her last $5 and suicidal when she meets Selby (Christina Ricci). After a rough start the two connect. Wuornos continues 'hooking' and is servilely raped by one of her Johns. She shoots him in self-defence. Aileen then begs Selby to move in with her and when Aileen is unable to find legitimate work she is forced to go back to working as a prostitute. Aileen soon makes a habit of shooting her costumers. Charlize Theron gives a totally convincing performance which is transcendently great, genuine and entirely astonishing. Her transformation from super beautiful to super ugly is amazing. It is not just a matter of make-up but a totally psychological embodiment. She truly gets into the psyche of Wuornos (she defiantly deserved her Oscar!) Charlize's performance is one that will be talked about for many years to come and it's done with an incredible amount of understanding of Wuornos' sentiment. Not for a second did Theron lose focus of Wuornos. It's a gut wrenching performance that is easily the unsurpassed. Theron finally has received the role that proves herself as a wonderful actress. To me this film was absolutely heart breaking. The authentic writing combined with Charlize's tour de force performance is totally compelling. The tragic ending will stay with you hours after the credits have rolled. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great performances in an off-centre film,"Films about real life serial killers aren't exactly rare, but the story of Aileen Wuornos stands out from many others because it turns the common serial killer story on its head. It's well known that most serial killers are white males aged between twenty five and forty; so the fact that this killer was a woman is notable, as is the fact that Aileen Wuornos was a prostitute who killed men, when it is more commonly the other way around. Wuornos' story is well worth telling, therefore, and the fact that this film was an Oscar contender means that it received good handling and is bolstered by a pair of truly great performances from two top actresses; yet somehow, Monster isn't a great film and falls short of the high standard that many other biopics have set. The plot revolves around prostitute Aileen Wuornos' meeting with Selby; a young lesbian hanging out in a gay bar. We follow the pair as they skip from motel to motel, and we find out what drove Aileen Wuornos to a series of horrible crimes, in which she killed potential clients for their money without having to have sex with them.The main reason why this film fails is because of the perspective. In any real-life serial killer biopic, no matter what reasons there were for the crimes, the killer has to be the antagonist. However, director Patty Jenkins has seen fit to make Aileen out to be a victim, and while it's evident that she had a bad life; her crimes were horrible nonetheless, and the happy 'feel good' tone of the film is abysmal in the way that it offsets the seriousness of the killer's crimes. The plot plays out like a serial killer flick fused with a romance movie, in the way that it portrays its central pair, and it's obvious that the director wanted us to feel for the plight of the lead character. Credit where credit is due, however; Patty Jenkins gets great performances out of both of her stars. The usually glamorous Charlize Theron is unrecognisable as the 'monster', and gives a brutal and realistic portrayal of the character. Christina Ricci hasn't made a lot of good films recently; but her performance here is faultless, as she brilliantly delivers a performance that takes in all the insecurities and naiveté's of her character. Overall, this film is worth seeing for the lead performances and for the basic plot line, which is interesting; but it's a shame that it wasn't given better handling.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Heartbreaking,"I wasn´t really prepared for a film like this. When I saw the Oscars I had only seen ""Somethings Gotta Give"" and not ""Monsters"" so I was like ""How could Charlize win over Diane Keaton, one of the best actresses ever?"" I didn´t think that a film about a prostitute killer could be so good and so touching that it would give the leading role an Oscar for best actress. While watching this film I felt sorry for Aileen, who really wanted a good life for her and her new girlfriend, the only person in her whole life who liked her, thinking that maybe there was a plan for her too. A chance to live a normal life, like everyone else. I guess she didn´t have that luck anyway. She gave up that for her lover Selby. For her she went back to the prostitution, so she could maker her happy, but after that her ""John"" was about to rape her, she got enough. Once again her loving Selby got her get back in the hard rough world. It was too much for Aileen who was probably by that time really fed up with those men. So she killed them one after one. Like she was punishing them for what they were about to do, buy sex. For everyones sake I wish it went a better way.This film is one of the best ones I´ve ever seen. Believe me or not I did feel sorry for her for all the things she went through in her life, and that it had to end up the way it did. She was a killer and a victim at the same time. I believe that Selby also was guilty (manipulating her to kill).Now I understand why Charlize got her Oscar. And she did more than deserve it.

Sympathy For The Devil.,"A great little film with a power-house central performance by Charlize Theron as Aileen Wuornos, one of America's female serial killers.The film is essentially a love story, as Aileen meets and falls for Selby (Christina Ricci) - a young girl who is estranged from society and her immediate family. This infatuation takes place whilst Aileen is beginning to murder her victims and Selby seems to ignore any tell tale signs of the murders taking place - the film shows Aileen hiding this from Selby for most of their relationship. Making Selby an innocent party in this portrayal of the events.Most Serial Killer flicks are driven by the killer being hunted by the detective, but Patty Jenkins (writer and director) moves away from this and progresses the movie by character development, emotional insight and empathy - it's a very female approach and works extremely well with this story. I think a male director may have taken a different slant with this subject matter, both in the character motivation and lesbian aspects of the movie, but Patty's approach softens these themes and lets the characters come through, but still leaving them interesting and slightly ambiguous.Patty and Charlize have a lot of sympathy for Aileen and this shows in the screen treatment - even the title demonstrates this - here ""Monster"" refers to a Ferris Wheel and Aileen's fondest childhood memory, rather than the human ""Monster"" that she became. It's a brave move as a lot of the Genre's fans may be expecting a gore or chase movie, and this gives a very human portrayal of Aileen Wuornos, exploring a lot of her abusive back-ground and examining the potential inherent violence in prostitution. She also shows regret and reserve when the murders are not as a result of direct violence against her. The ""serial killer mythos"" is also de-glamorised in this instance, both in appearance (with Charlize Theron made up with a blotchy skin condition and shaved eye-brows) and in portrayal - Alieen is shown as a regular working woman trying to make life's circumstances work for her, not the cold-blooded reclusive ultra-intelligent sociopath from most of these flicks.It's a sad little tale, and you feel that the cards were really stacked against Aileen, but there must be thousands of people in exactly the same circumstances who do not end up as serial murderers.

A killer movie with a killer performance,"He is definitely a really good movie that has impressed and surprised me in many ways. I do not like watching movies that deal with crime. Just say I'm not a fan of crime thrillers or crime movies but I'm very interested in what's going on in the human head and that's why movies based on true events and the biography of a criminal or convicted person are always very interested I do not have much of this Film expected and even if I had that I would still be surprised to the most positive.
The actors are doing a great job but I can not say more about the story the music the rest of the movie is okay but I think the director is really unique and this is one of those movies where I wish there were more female directors because there are some topics feelings and mindsets in films that can only be followed by a woman and therefore only women can bring decent.So this is not a movie I would buy or anything but definitely one that I would watch at again when he is on TV or whatever I can recommend to anyone who is also interested but I say you should have a strong stomach.PS:
I take my hat off to Charlize Theron not only because she is, in my opinion, one of the most beautiful white women of all time.
she is a fantastic actress who always goes out of her way even in her bad movies she does a good job and a good job and here comes the best of her for show and I just can not believe what the make up artist did for a fantastic job because they are unknowable and it's almost unbelievable who is going to do it.

Run-of-the-mill serial killer story gets met with TV-movie-style,"This movie on a whole works and holds interest. That is what matters but that doesn't mean that it is anything special much. It basically your standard serial killer in love piece with little surprises. To even further bring this from an anything special status, it is a given TV-style directing that makes this feel less like a theatrical film and more like something quality on Lifetime.The direction is easily the weakest aspect and really makes the film look cheap and bland and like pretty much all those other low-budget serial killer dramas like Dahmer or GacyThe acting is fine, and I suppose the Oscar not un-deserved, but it wasn't all that special except for the physical performance of the lead I guess the main problem with this good film is that it really doesn't stick out nor does it achieve theatrical quality. If you catch it on television, it could make for a nice afternoon time-killer in the way that quality TV-movies of this type would be",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Christina Ricci once again dominates and shocks the world with her talented acting yet the one who did the greatest job is Charlize Theron as Aileen. I also give a hand to the make-up department because they made Ricci very young (like a teenager) and Theron VERY, VERY OLD and decrypted (She 49 years old, and she was in her thirties!!)

Tries to make a serial killer look good,"The movie is about a serial killer and how she starts killing men whom she meets on the highway while hitch hiking. The serial killer has been portrayed going through the steps in becoming the monster she turns out to be.I don't have any issue with making movies about real people. But, this goes a bit far and a few issues that I have
1. Glorifies a serial killer to a certain extent. IMO, the treatment should have been like NAZI movies are given. There is no good Nazi and similarly, there are no good serial killers
2. Shaming/blaming the victims - most of the victims are shown in poor light and as if they should have been killed and the monster was justified to a certain extent. Not acceptable at all",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Highly overrated,"Charlize Theron's performance in Monster was impressive, but in no way deserving of the acclaim and awards the actress has been getting. Monster is a film that is bleak to the heart, and the gimmick of seeing a gorgeous woman convincingly look ugly does not erase the fact that the thematic content of this movie is void of redeeming facet.Patty Jenkins supposedly does not want us to sympathize with this woman, but the film I saw cried out for us to sympathize with her.Even worse, the families of the victims of this serial killer have claimed to be upset that the film shows some of the murders as having been committed in self defense, something that there is no evidence of in real life.Great crime films are about the victims, and the great ones that are not about the victims do not attempt to make horrible people like martyrs. Aileen Wuornos does not deserve a movie that suggests any of the murders she committed were ok.Monster is a watchable, but completely negative and depressing expirence at the movies.",,Anonymous,Biography
One of the best dramatized serial killer films,"The first thing that will catch your attention is how PHENOMENAL the casting for Aileen was. Perfect actor for the job, in terms of looks to the voice and mannerisms.This depressing romance story flows nicely from point A to B, with only a brief moment around 3/4ths in where things begin to get repetitive or samey (about a 5-15min section) but don't let that talk you out of watching it. It's an overall great film that hangs up there with the best movies done on serial killers.Similar films to this would be the Ted Bundy film from the early 2000's-fans of that will enjoy this movie as well, and they're about equal in rating.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Not exactly a date movie...,"If you've seen Nick Broomfield's doc 'Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer' then you'll know how uncannily accurate Charlize Theron's performance is in Monster, as the alternately terrifying and sympathetic Aileen Wuornos. Given the rest of her output, I'd be shocked if it isn't the defining performance of her career, but given the towering nature of it, most people would be glad to add it to their résumé. Monster is a bleak, depressing and harrowing film, and Theron is the centre of it. However, of equal importance is Christina Ricci, as she serves to balance Theron and give a dramatic hook to the story. As the plaudits showered upon Theron, I think Ricci was overlooked, as she also gives a terrific performance as the weak Selby, who is complicit in most of the crimes and thus just as much a Monster in many ways.Certainly the film takes liberties with the facts of the case, but so what? It is entertainment, not education. I am sure Wuornos' victims' families were not all happy that she was painted in such a way as to help understand her crimes rather than to simply vilify her for them, but as a disturbing picture of the evil that men and women do, Monster is top class.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Mostly powerful, but hardly a classic","Dark true story about prostitute Aileen (Charlize Theron), who in hope for a better life starts going out with young girl Selby (Christina Ricci) and killing/robbing her clients. While we first feel for her (her first 'victim' would have killed her if he had the chance), in the end she loses control completely. The scene where she shoots a guy that is really trying to help her is so hard to take... one of the most powerful and disturbing scenes I've seen in a while.Powerful probably *is* where the movie's aiming at and it gets the job done. The movie is dark and gives you an idea of how things work at the bottom of society... not a pretty sight for sure. Sometimes it's hard to understand the decisions the characters make, but most of the time you keep on feeling for the Aileen character, how monstrous she might act at times.One last thing: it seems 'Monster' is all about Charlize Theron, getting ugly and winning an Academy Award for it. But the true star is the amazing Christina Ricci, who is playing the Selby character so well, *she* should have won something for it, but didn't. Let's hope we keep on hearing from her.Final score: 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Aileen Carol Wuornos (2/29/59 - 10/9/02),"This movie is not for everyone. It's hard to take & depressing. It's the story of a lost, tortured soul who was certainly ""walking wounded"". She was a serial killer & by all accounts only the first killing was justified & the lowlife deserved his fate. The film tells the story of Aileen (Lee) Wuornos without justifying what she did. The viewer actually gets to know her as a human being & I sympathized with her to a degree. It's the humanization of her that made me sympathize with her. Otherwise, she'd just be another nut-job/hooker/murderer who also got what she deserved. There are some insights into her here & there in the film (molested as a child, raped by a family ""friend"", beaten by her father who later committed suicide, discarded by her siblings, became a prostitute at 13 to survive, battered by partners & cops, alcoholism etc.) that make you feel that this somewhat powerless & uneducated woman actually became addicted to killing once she started because it was a release of anger & hatred that had built up inside of her for so many years. I also felt sympathy for her because she wanted to ""go straight"" & work but she set her sights too high & was knocked down once again. Granted, the attempt to straighten her life out was mostly out of fear of being caught after she killed the first guy in self defense, but she also loved Selby & possibly wanted more ""nomalcy"" for them as a couple in that respect as well. I know the movie takes liberties with some facts. For example, the real Selby was not a whiny, naive nineteen year old, but a big bruiser who enjoyed instigating & egging Wuornos on into fights with others. Charlize Theron deserved her Oscar for portraying & transforming herself into this complex woman with so much passion & dedication.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Sympathy For The Devil,"With the look of Charlize as Aileen Woronos, and a title like Monster - one would expect pure loathing for this woman by movies end. But is truly amazing the pain and loss one feels WITH her when it comes to the end. She could've been anyone in anyone's neighbourhood. But there's always that teenage girl that rebels from serving fast food, and opts to serve fast flings. And for whatever reason, that became Aileen's skill in life. And she was good at it, survived it, accepted it. Until an encounter with a lesbian changed her whole outlook. Men were to become an expendable evil that would fund the albeit short future of Aileen and Selby. Much in the vein of In Cold Blood and Badlands, where ones shocked at seeing the harrowing crimes and deaths. But at the same time understanding them, and wishing there could've been an alternative. As tough and street smart as Aileen was, she could've been a very different and successful woman had circumstances not forced her into such limitations early in life.

Monster,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerGlamour girl Charlize Theron's breathtaking, heartbreaking transformation into the completely opposite image of Wuornos makes this film an astonishing achievement. The movie does not explain or dive into the mind of Wuornos which is a missed opportunity. The story also focuses to much on the lesbian love story side than on the killings.What makes the movie a little bit better is Theron's performance, open, vulnerable, tragic, moving, and most of all, honest. Aileen's behavior is contradictory, volatile, and disturbed. She loses control and lashes out irrationally. Theron's portrait of Aileen is sympathetic without pretending that she is more of a victim than the men she killed.The pacing is very slow and the runtime is overlong.SPOILER ON NEXT LINEI really wished we could have heard the testimonial given by Selby. Also I wish we could have seen the execution and Wuornos' last words.SPOILER OVERPro: Interesting story, Theron's performance, and some good killingsCons: Missed opportunities when it comes to the story (see spoiler line), slow pacing, an overlong runtime, and not enough depth into the mind of WuornosOverall Rating: 6.2",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Infamous film.,"This film is a cheap exploitation about the life of a serial killer whose existence is sweetened for the sole purpose of showcasing Charlize Theron's acting repertoire. Not in vain she was the producer. There are certain films that are made exclusively for the show of whoever is behind them and this is a shameful example. With a discourse of extreme hatred towards men, the male class is vulgarized to the category of ""everyone should be punished for the simple fact of having sexual desires and resorting to a professional."" Then it is emphasized that because she had a dysfunctional family, she ended up in a terrible crossroads that would end up bathing her in blood (other people's blood). A character like this is surrounded by certain companions to show off her grotesque and indefensible personality. As a color note, Kane Hodder appears in a contained character. For those of us who know the story of the inspiration for this film, the vision of this film was similar to torture. Very bad in every way, an infamous film.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Aileen Wournos,"I finally watched the movie tonight on DVD. I have avoided it for years as I actually met Aileen Wournos. I met her in a Burger King in Wildwood, Fl. on my way to Miami. The next morning in the hotel I received a newspaper with the composite sketch. I was blown away and naturally I called police right away. It took on a life of its own while she was being searched for and I was on the witness list but never called. Fortunately she was captured around Jan. 10th or so.I have to say I understand why Theron won the Oscar. It was almost like seeing Aileen again. Theron had the chilling features and expressions on her face, the only thing she didn't have was Wournos's eyes. I have never been stared through to the bone before as she looked at me.

I have to admit that she rather repulsed me, it took me some effort to connect with her due to the heavily adapted male body language. The role of Christina Ricci also challenged me. Because all she did was ask, even though she realized what ""sacrifices"" her friend had made for her.All in all, this is rather ""heavy fare"" Very well realized and I take my hat off to the strength that such women muster to endure such a life.

Feminism lives!,"""Monster"" is a strongly overreacted tribute to feminism. It is hard to understand what did the critics find in this film. Only some radical feminists as Kyle's mom from ""South Park"" may like this. We see an extraordinarily ugly prostitute who kills her clients after she has served them, and sometimes even before doing the work. With her cap, she looks just like some guy who works in a car repairing workshop. She is a nervous wreck and there is no explanation for that. Charlize Theron got an Oscar for her role. True, she plays well. She is beautiful actually but she has been made ugly in the film. It is a big mystery to me though, why does she have to be so ugly. I do not think that any man, however desperate, would even glance at a woman like her. We should not pity her. Killing a man is unjustified. If there is a moral in this film, it might be as follows: never talk to an ugly woman, especially when she is a prostitute.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

And I don't think everything that actor has to do to make it is a changing-person make-up, and repeating the person's mimics and movements. Maybe she is good.

And they uglyed Christina Ricci; she looks bad with a mullet. But the film does deserve some of the criticism it got by making Aileen almost sympathetic. There was nothing sympathetic about her. She killed her johns for money and it was premeditated.And for those interested, the make out scenes with Theron and Ricci were very mild to what's in other films.FINAL VERDICT: It wasn't the best film of the year, but at least it had a plot that made sense and wasn't unbelievable.

"Good, but Charlize Theron pretty much makes the whole film","Monster is a true story about the real life of Aileen Wuornos, who is one of America's first female serial killers that began a killing spree on roadway drivers by acting as a prostitute in order to get money. This is a pretty good film with an excellent performance by Charlize Theron, who in my opinion, made the whole film and I guess that is why you could say she brought home an Oscar for her dedication to the role. The story about Aileen Wuornos is very dark and powerful and that is why I really wanted to see the movie. Although, a terrific performance by Theron and pretty good performance of Christina Ricci, the movie relies to much on its killing spree. I would of liked to see more of the chemistry of Ricci and Theron. There are moments of it, but not enough, considering the two in real life were always together.

Charlize Theron carried the film,"This film is based on a true story although some of it may not be factual, it's about serial killer Aileen Wuornos was convicted and then executed 12 years ago in Florida. Wuornos was a prostitute who hitchhiked across central Florida to find customers. And society just shuts her down, making it difficult for her to succeed at anything cause she is deprived of the opportunities. The highlight of this movie is Charlize Theron cause she did a pretty good performance and she really sacrificed a lot for this role especially her figure by gaining a lot of extra pounds. The plot and direction of the film wasn't that great though, I just wish they had taken a more ambiguous approach cause this wasn't as dark as I thought it would be, but yes it was depressing in a good way. What I thought was good about the film though is that it's something a lot of girls and some guys can relate with, cause in the real world appearances mean everything, sad but true and people will accept you in the future for job and other tasks you may dream of doing just by your looks alone, so a lot of women out there with a butter face can relate with this film. I don't know how much of it was factual, but it wasn't gripping as I hoped it to be and forgetful. Oh and Christina Ricci was annoying as always, even if it's her character in this film and work well with it. Aileen played by Charlize Theron wasn't a character I could sympathize with even if some may disagree, her killing sprees just start to make you lose interest after a while although the scenario maybe a bit different.

The Human Soul is an Abyss,"So the great Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa wrote in one of his poems. And this is true. Besides that the society where we live now creates these monsters like this movie clearly shows. Two young women (one of them much younger than the other) coming from quite opposite social and living poles meet one another by chance, fell in love with one another and start a tragic life together. The eldest had thrown herself into prostitution at the age of 13 after (like she herself tells at a given moment) having been continuously raped by a friend of her father. After having killed a client in self-defence, she takes hold of his gun and becomes a serial killer in part because she needs the money she takes from the victims after killing them, to support herself and her girlfriend but also because she hates them and herself and the life she leads. In the abyss of her soul good and evil live side by side and weave tragically together. On the good side there is also still the love she maintains by her companion who is a fragile person and much weaker than her and raising a few problems to her. Both characters are well depicted psychologically in words, manners and behaviour though Charlise Theron (Aileen the prostitute) has maybe too many facial and corporal ticks and twitches but maybe also the real woman (this is supposed to be a veracious story) was also like that. Anyway the performance of both actresses is good enough though not particularly brilliant. Summing it up although this is not exactly a masterpiece (even because the story is simple enough) but certainly a rather good movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

The truth would've actually made a better, more interesting story than the concocted, cliched version they tried to pass off.The real life events didn't unfold in the manner presented.

"Great Touching and Dramatic True Story, With Stunning Performance of Charlize Theron and Excellent Direction","Aileen (Charlize Theron) is an unloved highway prostitute, who has been molested since she was a child. She has been treated like an object by the men, and has a huge need of love. One night, she meets Selby (Christina Ricci), an unsecured young lesbian woman, who treats her like a human being, in a gay bar and she falls in love with her. Aileen tries to have a straight life, with a regular job to support Selby, but the lack of a professional qualification and education send her back to the prostitution. One night, a client rapes her and she kills him in self-defense. This trauma leads her to be a serial killer. This movie is presently in the movie theaters of Rio de Janeiro, but yesterday I rented an imported DVD in an excellent Brazilian rental ('Longametragem'). The dramatic story of Aileen is very touching, and in the end I felt sorrow and sympathy for her sad and miserable life. The performance of Charlize Theron is stunning, and she really deserved the Oscar of best actress she won. Christina Ricci is also wonderful, as usual. The firm direction of Patty Jenkins is excellent. He leads the story is such a raw way without concessions, showing both sides of the personality of Aileen, but never being corny.

"Not a bad film, but Charlize was too distracting","Usually, when I go see a film where I know that an actor has radically changed their appearance, my interest is peaked another notch.  And for good reason.  Tom Hanks shut down production for almost a full year so that he could lose weight and grow a beard for his role in CastAway and who can forget Robert DeNiro's packing on the pounds for his role as Jake LaMatta in Martin Scorcese's Raging Bull?   So when I first saw the trailers for Patty Jenkins' new film Monster, I was amazed to see the transformation of the lead character played by Charlize Theron.  Sporting fake teeth, no make-up (or so it looks), stringy hair and enough extra weight to make three super-models, Charlize Theron transformed herself into the physical appearance of serial killer Aileen Wuornos.But the fact that Charlize looks nothing like Charlize is actually a distraction for most of the movie.  Such press has covered her transformation that when you first see Aileen Wuornos, you can't help but try and look for Ms. Theron under all the ugliness.  The best way for me to explain it, is to have you think of Mel Gibson's character in Man Without A Face.  Audiences were turned off or confused by Mel's new look and the movie grossed only $25 million domestically.  We just couldn't get over something so beautiful looking so hideous.And all this is unfortunate, because Monster is not a bad little indi-film. The movie is based on the true story of Aileen Wuornos who was responsible for the death of seven men, including one police officer, in Southern Florida.   Aileen, we learn, comes from a tragic home life, where she was abused by a friend of the family and beaten by her father.  This leads Aileen into a life of low self-esteem, prostitution and a hate for the male species that continues to deteriorate.Then, in only a scenario where the planets would have aligned perfectly, Aileen falls in love with Shelby Wall (Christina Ricci) and the two run off together. It is within this relationship where Aileen falls deeper and deeper into her dark self as she resorts to a life of murder and crime to support Shelby's desire to live free and travel the world.    All this comes crashing down when Aileen mistakenly kills a retired police officer and soon her life on the run ends in her capture and eventual death penalty sentence (Aileen was executed in Florida in 2002).Typical to the indi-film experience, there are few characters in Monster, and that works to the films advantage since the movie was so brilliantly cast.  Charlize towers over the smaller Christina and that helps us understand the power over the big eyed, naïve Shelby Wall.  Where the film fails however, is in its attempt to elicit any emotional attachment between Aileen and the audience.  When Aileen says good-bye to Shelby and puts her on a bus back to Ohio to protect her from the eventual capture for their wrong doings, you are not tugged by any heartstrings or feel anything for a character that so brutally murdered seven helpless males.  Writer/director Patty Jenkins tries too hard to convert the audience into having sympathy for Aileen due to her abusive background and her compassion towards a nervous, first-time john that refuses to have rough sex with her.Most of the focus of this film will be on Charlize and her new-found look, but it is Christina Ricci that really holds her own as the innocent lesbian lover that runs away from home and lives by the success and failures of Aileen's crimes.  Christina's adoring stares and adolescent exuberance are a refreshing change of pace from the main characters heavy breathing and mothering tendencies.So a small thumbs up for Monster.  I just wish I didn't know who Charlize Theron was before the transformation.  Maybe that way I would be more interested in the character and less interested on how much she looked like Jon Voight in drag.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A chick comes home to roost,"""Monster"" comes at the story of notorious highway hooker and serial killer Aileen Carol Wuornos from a unique angle by developing a character who is so beat up by life, so failed by society, and so weakened by emotional pain that the only way she knows to sustain the shred of happiness she finds in an ill-wrought lesbian relationship is to seduce her victims by plying her trade and then killing them to get all of their money. Theron's Oscar winning and much lauded performance as Wuornos is first rate indeed but probably over-touted because of the rub-off from her physical metamorphosis and the intense drama of her situation thanks to the vision of the film's relatively obscure auteur Patty Jenkins. It is rare that a film engenders such compassion for a killer as does ""Monster"" in a society which tends to simply lump all street whores, drug addicts, homeless people, etc. into the ""loser"" category so they can be swept under the cultural carpet and forgotten. Kudos to Jenkins for this moving and disturbing look at the price of ignoring those most in need but too fractured to cry for help. (A-)",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Big girls don't cry,"Patty Jenkins accomplishes the impossible with this film. She has transformed an otherwise gorgeous woman, Charlize Theron, into the monster that was Aileen Wuornos.What turns a common person into a monster? In the case of Ms Wuornos, we get to know that she was formed by the environment where she comes from. She is the victim of abuse, growing up in a household where she is a burden. She becomes an outcast whose only alternative is to turn into prostitution, since that's the only thing she can do with no other skills to herself.Supposedly this tragic figure was not gay. At the beginning of the story she walks into a bar that caters to gays, unknown to her. Selby is at the bar and feels an attraction for the rough Aileen, someone completely opposite of her.Ms. Theron's transformation is incredible. It's probably the role of her career; nothing from now on will compare to this character at all. Christina Ricci's work as Selby is not as flashy, but she holds her own, as she is an accomplished actress who has probably more experience than her co-star. Since the role of Selby pales against the work of Charlize Theron, she was bypassed for a look at the best featured actress.The other surprise was Bruce Dern, who has nothing to do in the film, but has a key scene in the film.Ms. Jenkins has worked wonders with this film based in a true story. She has a great future ahead of her.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Charlize Theron is uncannily like Wuornos,"I didn't know a film had made about the infamous serial killer Aileen Wuorons and just 2 years after her execution in 2002.

Very glad I did , i can see how but why she was disturbed also some of the injustice which I won't spoil.I don't agree with the death penalty, personally for this person she needed to be in hospital for the rest of her days.The American system of an eye for an eye simply is ineffective",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

I am no prude, but the film was distasteful in so many ways I doubt anyone could watch it and not feel violated in one way or another.To get an academy award for this film is unbelievable. I've rarely commented on films, but this one was so bad it needs a warning.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Humanizing a Killer,"One of the hardest things to do is made a typically unsympathetic character sympathetic. Monster deals with a famous serial killer from the early 1990's who believed she was killing for good reasons. Finding a way to write a direct such a character so that the audience doesn't automatically despise your lead is a difficult thing to do. Patty Jenkins and Charlize Theron found a way to do just that with Aileen Wuornos. The story deals with Aileen, who has had a rough life to say the least. She's been a prostitute since an early teen, physically abused by her family, and has been homeless for years ever since being kicked out of her home. Just by hearing that, there's at least some sense of pity I feel for her. This all leads to her meeting Selby Wall (based on Tyria Moore). The film portrays both of them at a rough patch in their life, which makes it all the more timely that they meet each other. After a relatively sweet romance for the first 40 minutes of the film, Aileen begins her crime spree. We may never know exactly how it all went down, but if she originally killed first victim because he was raping her and likely going to murder her, then I can feel a lot of sympathy towards her. As I said, Jenkins makes a choice to present Aileen as a victim herself, but that changes about halfway through. But I really appreciate the balance Jenkins gives to the crimes. They aren't faceless crimes without purpose, she's doing them for love and because her life is close to worthless without the money she's getting. By no means does that dismiss her from having any guilt, as no one should be murdered, but you can begin to understand her mindset just a little bit. It doesn't hurt that you have a great actress like Charlize Theron to build your film around, as she earned an Oscar for her turn as Aileen. It was well deserved I may add. Overall, Monster is a fascinating movie to get inside of a murderous psychopath, but it's more the moments of humanity in Aileen that stand out the most.7.4/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Here's specifically why it's so good.,"In an Oscar-winning role, Charlize Theron plays prostitute-turned-serial-killer Aileen Wuornos. ""Monster"" shows how, because of how Wuornos was treated her whole life, she was basically incapable of treating anyone nicely. The movie doesn't glorify her by any stretch, but it doesn't demonize her either. It's overall a look at how we are all products of our upbringings. As Wuornos, Theron is almost unrecognizable: she plays a character as unglamorous as can be, with sunburned skin, and girth practically unseen on actresses these days. Christina Ricci is equally good as Wuornos' companion Selby. These two actresses have accomplished what may be the best roles of their careers. It's certainly good that Charlize Theron won the Oscar.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Monster,"I learned the subject after the movie, but it was excellent in terms of acting.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Could have been better,"Monster has many flaws that go overlooked solely because of Charlize Theron's performance as serial killer Aileen Wuornos.  Theron carries the entire movie on her back and the argument can and will be made that it is one of the greatest performances ever by an actress.  I saw the documentary Aileen Wuornos: The Selling of a Serial Killer several years ago and while I was watching Monster, there were times that I forgot Charlize Theron was in the movie.  She does such an amazing job as Wuornos that it is hard to separate the real Aileen from the fake one.  For people who have never heard of Aileen Wuornos, they will be just as blown away by Theron.  The movie starts strong as it shows the beginning of Aileen's relationship with Selby (Ricci).  The audience also begins to understand how this monster was created although it never seems to be explored in depth.  The bond between Selby and Aileen, as well as Aileen's story, are both very interesting but midway through the film the movie begins to repeat itself and loses its focus.  This is not a great movie, but rather an okay movie with an incredible performance in it.  8/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"'I was raised in America, and America hates me for what I am. I am YOUR sh**, you should be ashamed of what you have eaten.'","My compliments to the musical tastes of anyone who can place that quote. Hey, you wanna know what I'm getting sick and tired of? I'm sick and tired of hearing the phrase 'America's First Serial Killer,' if only because it's generally a phrase used to promote Monster, the stunningly well-made and effective movie about Aileen Wuornos, who was not in any way a serial killer. Serial killers kill people because of the order that their names appear in the phone book (the Terminator did, anyway), because of their addresses, certain physical or even behavioral characteristics, whatever. Basically they are targeted based upon a quite often arbitrary set of circumstances. Aileen Wuornos killed people because she was so psychologically damaged by the experiences she suffered in her life and because of her desperate attempt to earn (if you could call it earning) something real and pure and happy for herself and her newfound love. If nothing else, the fact that she is motivated by her desire for a better life and to be a better person separates her from the classification of 'serial killers.' Besides that, she was hardly killing off the best people that society had to offer.Charlize Theron's performance is probably the most famous performance of 2003, although not entirely because of the positive chatter that it generated. The way that she captures and becomes Aileen Wuornos is astonishing, even if you go into the movie looking for Theron under the make-up from the very beginning. It's as if she does not try to justify the amount of work needed to transform her stunning appearance into that of a hardened prostitute, but rather was transformed into that person, through the make-up as well as her own physical transformation. There's nothing more pathetic than people who complain that Theron didn't act, it was the make-up delivering her performance in this movie. PLEASE. On second thought, there are things more pathetic than that, and several of them get killed off in this movie.The movie does a pretty impressive job of walking the tightrope of the line between depicting how sickening these people are that Aileen kills without leaning toward the appearance of justifying her murders. But the thing that the movie wisely focuses on is the way that Aileen's life led her to what she became, straight from childhood, and the way she tried so hard to become something good and worthwhile. She tried so hard, in fact, that they made a movie about her.It is an important fact that Aileen's first murder was in self-defense, and that afterwards she found herself with a car and a few dollars in her pocket. It was presumably the only thing she had ever done other than what really can be called nothing but rape or sexual torture from which she profited in any way. And like the first time Charlie Chaplin saw people tossing coins and cheering at him after he ran onstage and sang a song when he was just a little kid, Aileen saw that this was something that she could make enough money from not only to earn a living (as was Chaplin's epiphany), but to get away from prostitution forever. Prostitution has destroyed her sexually, and given her experiences with the first guy she kills, it's not hard to see why she hates it so much. Interestingly, it is not immediately clear in this situation who is the victim of whom.Christina Ricci delivers a flawless performance of the naïve 18-year-old lesbian who falls in love with Aileen and ultimately wins Aileen's love as well, despite their tense first meeting. Ricci's shy demeanor and disarming cuteness are exactly what are needed to portray a kid getting into something that she really doesn't understand, all the while not noticing (it's hard to pinpoint when exactly she knows what's going on and when exactly she allows herself to believe it) what Aileen is doing in order to get them the life that they are both dreaming about. I would be curious to know what ever became of Selby Wall. The movie doesn't explain that much at the end other than to say that she and Aileen never spoke again. Sad but not entirely surprising. Multiple murders tend to put a damper on short-lived relationships really based mainly on lust and mutual, superficial needs. And by the way, this is probably just me, but Ricci looks exactly like Edward Furlong in this movie. They could be twins.Except for all that crap about 'America's First Serial Killer,' Monster doesn't take Aileen's story and turn it into an excuse to make a big Hollywood movie, but rather presents a different way to look at someone who has committed the crimes that Aileen has. The movie is about what a capitalist society, and even the very people charged with seeing after the safety of the people in that society ('The police used to watch over the people, now they're WATCHIN' the people,' my compliments again to the musical tastes of anyone who can place THAT quote), can do to create what Aileen Wuornos became. And the important thing to notice is that the movie is able to do that without offering any excuses for her murders. It's not a film about how someone was sentenced to death who didn't really deserve it because what she was wasn't really her fault, it's about what kinds of things can lead a person to such a life. Have you ever heard a story about some heinous crime and wondered how people get like that? Here are some ideas. Dismissing such people as monsters and executing them is a great way to get them off the street and stop their killing, but it's not really going to get us anywhere as far as preventing that behavior from surfacing in someone else.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

By what you ask? One word...Beetlejuice.

Slavery still weighs on women,"When one watches movies based on real events, such as this film, one realizes that the people's consciences has a lot to do with living conditions. As some philosophers say, people thought is a direct emanation of material conditions. The first thing to analyze is how the person is deformed, i.e. How he/she may become an offender or a delinquent. If the person is always mistreated in childhood, reaches adolescence poor and lacking school education, what alternative does she have for life? One must earn to eat and live. Aileen's life was that, all a martyrdom, and suffering the abuse and violence of men. Violence generates violence and that was evident in the life of that woman. This is a film and also a lesson of injustice on women.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Beauty Turned Beast,"I have seen a few transformations in my time, but I can't recall one as shocking as Charlize Theron's in Monster.  The babe most audiences have become accustomed to (The Italian Job, Devil's Advocate, etc.) underwent an enormous physical change as she took on the part of Aileen Wuornos.The role of Wuornos is that of older prostitute who has a trailer-park nature about her (no offense intended to trailer parks owners or patrons) and knows nothing other than sex serving as a way to make ends meet.  The portrayal of Wuornos is designed to be a sympathetic one, intended to show the difficulties of ""hooking"" and how such characters develop from a troubled childhood and other crises in life.Wuornos ends up meeting a young girl, Selby (Christina Ricci), whose infatuation with her makes Wuornos feel truly loved and cared about for the first time in her life.  Wuornos then attempts to ""hook"" enough money to take her and Selby out of a small Florida town.  But when she is beaten and sodomized by one of her johns, it causes Wuornos to start a killing spree that doesn't end until seven men are dead.This movie attempts to show us the ugly horrors that some of the considered ""low"" people in life experience.  It shows Wuornos as another human being suffering from some grim realities of life while altogether ignorant of others.  The film also tries to show you a kind side to Wuornos and why she acted as she did in murdering so many people.  But while the plot confronts the hardships and injustices Wuornos suffered, this in no way justifies her murderous actions.Overall, GREAT acting by Theron and Ricci in what almost seems like  Thelma & Louise at times.  This movie is definitely not intended for a younger audience and the overall nature of the film will probably appear somewhat depressing to most adult viewers.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good acting but lengthy,"I thought this movie was going to be superb after hearing Ms Theron had won an Oscar for it; however I was a little knocked back by the slow detailed script and lack of imagination of the Director to get the best out of his actors and surroundings. Basically I thought this movie verged on boring. By the end of the film and I think my Nth cup of tea/coffee I didn't get the point of making this movie. Was she an unfortunate abused child? Was it just a gory murder movie? No this was well thought out, but the problem with this script like all others like this is that it was based on a true event. Not all true events are exciting or that interesting, just because some strange woman starts killing people doesn't mean she's interesting. The film ended very quickly thank God, I was very disappointed.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Monster Mash,"Some people who have seen what Charlize Theron looks like in her new film `Monster'-either from the film or in publicity photos-have said that she looks `fat and ugly.' There is a perfectly good reason for people to have this reaction: they are morons. Anyone who sees this film and complains about Theron's looks should probably stick to `The Cider House Rules' or `2 Days in the Valley' or something, because to come away from a performance of this magnitude and complain that Theron isn't hot is like getting a free tour of heaven and complaining about the altitude. Theron's transformation into serial killer Aileen Wuornos is so complete and perfect that it will be impossible to discuss the all-time greatest acting jobs in the future without mentioning this one. She's that good.The film is based on the true story of Aileen Wuornos, a lifelong hooker who killed seven of her patrons in the late 1980's. Like any good story, `Monster' lives in its details. In less caring hands, this movie would have been nothing more than an exploitative shocker. The pieces are there: a lesbian relationship, a hooker, serial killings. But the actors and filmmakers have made a truthful film about real people, and that is what most viewers will come away with. `Basic Instinct' was another movie about a lesbian murderer, and that film took a lot of hits for presenting lesbians as evil, manipulative killers. This film will not have that same kind of backlash because it is not a film about lesbians as killers; it is a film about a woman who is driven to kill, and happens to be a lesbian.While Theron has gotten all of the press, Ricci is also very impressive as Wuornos' young lover. While I am not surprised to see Ricci in this kind of a movie-she has always been an actress who takes chances-I was surprised to see her performance. She is not her usual sardonic, cynical self; her Selby is more innocent and naïve than the character she played in `Casper.'`Monster' is a frightening movie, but it is also filled with intensely dark moments of comedy as Wuornos struggles to relate to people like a normal human. She is so inept in social conventions that when a man tells her to `call him daddy,' she asks him if it's because he likes to sleep with children. Wuornos is not like any serial killer I've seen before; aside from killing them, she did not horribly violate or mutilate her victims like Bundy or Dahmer, and she was not an intellectual like Hannibal Lecter. Perhaps more interesting and more telling than the fact that she was the first female serial killer is that she was the first serial killer to simply use a gun.`Monster' does not excuse the actions of Wuornos, nor does it present her as some kind of super-villain. It simply presents her story honestly and unflinchingly. Theron took a chance by bulking up for this role, and it paid off. This is a terrifically powerful movie.",,Anonymous,Biography
Outstanding performance and brilliant directing,"The movie is beyond excellent in the matter of directing and production aspects. The story is very well been presented where one can say it is not possible to do it better. The acting is superb as well especially Charlize Theron's magnificent performance.The story itself at the other hand is not as good as those perfect qualities. It could be paced better in the scenario I think. Turning worse from bad is something expected but showing the exact break points and the effects of the pas right in the present is not an easy job. I think scenario could have been written better in which the audience could see the chain of effects from the past while the current events happening, the true motives and how they work. The movie tells the story of a broken young girl turning bad and worse from an abused child to a prostitute and then a killer. That is well explained but while we see a movie about that process the most interesting part would be a detailed explanation of how that happens. I felt like the ""how"" part lacks something after I have watched it.However, beside that lack of detailed scenario, the movie absolutely worth watching and is no doubt interesting. You will enjoy it for sure even if you are not a big fan of crime movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Spot on,"The cinemas often seem to be over-run by films depicting implausible female serial killers with unusual sex lives as inhuman monsters. But this film is actually based on a true story, and in spite of its title, never reduces its central character to sub-human status. Indeed, anyone who has seen the documentary films Nick Broomfield made about Aileen Wuornos during her time on Death Row will be struck by how precisely Charlize Theron has captured her voice, her physical presence, and quite a lot of her character, although she never quite manages to represent the full extent of Wournos' madness, which is perhaps slightly suppressed in order to allow the film to bear at least some resemblance to a more normal story. Still, this is a tough and brave movie, actually interested in understanding how something as terrible as the events it depicts could have happened, and worth watching although unquestionably grim.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"good movie, amazing individual performance","Just to say that this is the perfect example where a good movie is good thanks to an astonishing individual performance. I think that Chalize Theron must have suffered some kind of violence to be able to act in that ""disturbing"" way. The academy award is the logic prize for a performance unique in his genre. Before this movie I liked her very much. After seeing Monster, I adore her and admire her talent. The physical transformation is startling and I was surprise by the dignity of Chalize in showing her wonderful body tortured by make up but also by some extra kilos and unnatural (for such a beauty) posture. During the movie you stop to think ""look at the power of the make up"" and you are forced to forget that there is a mask on her face. Morever, after 5 minutes you start inexorable to feel a growing pity for a girl that, considering that the movie is strictly based on a true story, has lived in a nightmare since she was 8 year old and has been unable to work it out, day after day simply for somebody to love and to be loved.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great acting but not much else,There's a reason Charlize Theron was nominated for this movie but nothing else was.  That's because the rest of the movie is very ho-hum.

Hollywood's idea of low class,"It takes more than acting talent for a rich Hollywood actress to truly emulate the down-and-out, the homeless, prostitution, the so-called dregs of society... it takes true genius.  Charlize Theron is clearly no genius.  No amount of makeup, ""trash talk"" or other pretense can communicate the pervasive sense of despair, the drug abuse, the mental illness, the real attitudes and situations that poverty tends to bestow upon a person... having had occasion to be temporarily homeless a few times, maybe I'm a better judge of this than most.  From the beginning this film had ""Hollywood pretense"" written all over it, and I admit that I couldn't sit through any more after the first rape scene.  The film kept pegging my ""BS meter,"" although it may appeal to the more privileged (Roger Ebert?) who really have no clue what it's like to live this sort of a lifestyle.

No. No. No....Not more ludicrous liberal propaganda!,"First off, as far as Miss Theron's performance in this film goes, there is no argument. Charlize is simply incredible and although I thought Naomi Watts deserved the Oscar, I can live with the Academy's decision. But awards aside, let's consider the film. The film is a docudrama about the life of Aileen Wuornos, a hitchhiking prostitute who became an infamous highway serial killer. The film was produced by Theron because she wanted no studio interference with the project. Her bravado in this regard is admirable, as is her courage in selecting such a daring part so early in her career. Her honest attempt at portraying Aileen is without question a thing of beauty to behold. What is NOT beautiful, is the message the film attempts to try to get across. Contrary, to Roger Ebert's opinion (incidentally Ebert remains one of my favorite film critics) the film attempts to persuade the viewer that Miss Wuornos was an unloved, desperate, confused and mistreated street hooker who was pushed into her horrid actions by an alienated, uncaring society. Certainly, IF Charlize Theron's Aileen and the real life Aileen are the same person, then yes, I would agree with this. However, having done a good deal of research on the REAL Aileen Wuornos, I realized that the film leaves out important details to manipulate its audience.Rookie director Patty Jenkins chose to emphasize Aileen's wild and wacky relationship with her lesbian lover, incorrectly called Shelby in the film and portrayed by Christina Ricci. Aileen's real lover's name was Tyria Moore. She was freckled-faced and red headed. The writers have obviously made deliberate changes to avoid a lawsuit since she's still alive! But back to the missed details of the film. The film leaves out the fact that Wuornos often beat her ex-husband with his cane when he wouldn't give her money. It leaves out the fact that she propelled a billiards ball into a bartender's temple when she was in one of her angry moods. It leaves out the fact that she once held up a convenience store at gunpoint while dressed in a bikini. Those are some of the facts the film leaves out. But let's consider what the film covers about Wuornos. The main problem is the overemphasis on Aileen's lesbian lover. The love scenes are long and sometimes unnecessary.Also, Jenkins shows us only three of the six (possibly seven murders) committed by Wuornos. In two of the three murders, Aileen is shown as defending herself. Actually, she herself claimed that she was only raped and sodomized by Richard Malloy, her first victim. She admitted to cold-bloodedly killing the six others. (Of course she changed her stories between self-defense and murder many times throughout her arrest, trial and incarceration). The biggest flaw of the film is its failure to show any flashbacks about Wuorno's traumatic childhood which was complicated, intriguing and sad. Overall, Ricci and Theron were outstanding performers in the piece and Jenkins certainly is a promising newcomer, but the suggestion of the film that Wuornos was a victim of circumstance is unacceptable. The families of the victims were horrified by this film and if you know a few basic facts about the real Aileen Wuornos, you will be too.",,Anonymous,Biography
Stunning Performances,"Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci excel in their respective roles as serial killer Aileen Wuornos and her lover in director/writer Patty Jenkins' imagining of the circumstances that would drive Wuornos to commit the murders of seven Florida men (most of them thinking they were picking up a streetwalker). Jenkins' theories are all over the map and include pretty much the garden variety of possibilities (Wuornos' abuse as a child, her lack of education precluding her getting reasonable employment, her brutal rape at the hands of her first victim, etc.) but, fortunately, she's less interested in dwelling on her sociological positions than in letting her performers dissolve into their characters. Theron, in particular, is stunning: she seems to connect with Wuornos in a primal, subconscious manner and you get the feeling Theron is living the part, not merely acting it. Always an intriguing performer (she was quite good in `The Devil's Advocate'), here she refuses to hide behind her sun-scarred makeup and weight gain and succeeds in letting emerge Wuornos' entire personality rather than simply her barbaric need for revenge. Ricci is also excellent, as usual, smoothly underplaying a role that could have easily evolved into a histrionic attempt to capture the picture; like Theron, she seems attracted to the darker side of her nature but is able to use her complex powers of suggestion for definition rather than signal her conflicts. Together, the performances lift `Monster' above its overall routine disposition (though there is some nice late-afternoon cinematography by Steven Bernstein and the font used by Elton Garcia in the title, the same one used for Marlboro cigarettes, is a nice touch). With Bruce Dern as Wuornos' homeless ally and Pruitt Taylor Vince as the pathetic stuttering john intended by Jenkins to emblemize Wuornos' misguided compassion.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A Fine Film, Could Have Used More Action","Aileen Wuornos was probably the most notorious serial killers of the past few decades, certainly the most notable female killer. This film brings her story to the forefront, to the attention of the mainstream American audience, who may not otherwise be acquainted with serial killer minutiae.For those watching ""Monster"" as a horror film, it may be a bit of a disappointment. There's precious little blood and gore, and even the violence is not the primary focus. It is not one of those low budget, exploitative serial killer flicks. This comes off as more of a drama, and even though Charlize Theron presents Aileen as a ""monster"", we have her presented from an angle where we can see her tortured logic, and almost even identify... on at least one occasion, the homicide seems justified.What drew me to this was the inclusion of my love, Christina Ricci, in the supporting actress role. While it is not one of my favorite roles she's played (for those, see ""Addams Family"" or ""Casper"" or many others), she does it well. She comes off as the naive lesbian girl just wanting to be loved, perhaps too much so. For all the protection Aileen can offer, is it worth the cost? This is a well made film. It's gritty, grim but still watchable. Theron and Ricci give good performances, as does just about everyone else. What makes this film difficult to rate highly is it's inability to be categorized. Not really horror, but a bit dark for a drama... more like a film you'd find on the Lifetime network, only actually decent. If you want a cinematic account of Wuornos' life, this is the one you want... otherwise I don't know who to recommend this one to.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A near miracle,"Theron and Ricci give performances in this film that defy what anyone can reasonably expect from actors.  They are so credible, so vulnerable and so utterly convincing, they become more than just believable; they become real. After watching this film twice, their realism is disturbingly intimate. I honestly feel  a sense of 'knowing' these people.  Wuornos and Selby feel, in my gut, like people I actually spent time with.  Acting rarely has the power to occupy a part of our memory; here, it possesses the power of an actual experience, an actual acquaintance. Theron rightly won an Academy awrd for this role, and should receive recognition as one of the best, riskiest actors working in mainstream film today.  Ricci's role was less of a physical transformation, but no less compelling.  She deserves an equal share of recognition for the greatness of this picture.Patty Jenkins direction is perfect, from the use of sound and (period) music, to her masterful choices editing.  Film violence is so common as to be dull, yet Jenkins crafted a genuine sense of horror around the inevitable killings.  Cutting away from them to emotional aftermath scenes made the weight of the crime almost unbearable.  You don't necessarily 'side with' Wuornos, but you empathize with her panicked fear, her demand from the universe that the violence be forgotten as much to have peace in her life as to evade human justice.Reading a little about the Wuornos case after the film, I am a bit disappointed at the dramatic license taken in the script.  Time is compressed into what appears to be a few panicky weeks of killing; in fact, Wuornos killed more men over a longer time period than shown here.  This makes the film's version easier to choke down.  The film Wuornos seems more surrounded by fate.  In reality, Wuornos had much more breathing room between her crimes, and less of a linear pressure to come up with cash. Also, Selby (who is based on a real life woman named Tyria Moore) is far more vulnerable and empathetic than Wuornos' real girlfriend.  Moore, for example, called Wuornos numerous times in prison to manipulate her into confessing her crimes over a bugged phone.  Moore also was not the gentle, church-raised young lesbian Selby was; she had had numerous other female relationships, and a minor criminal record prior to meeting Wuornos. Their love may have been as intense and genuine as shown in the film, but their lives were so distinct a contrast of innocence and experience.Departing from fact doesn't detract from the film's power or value.  It does, however, temper what I took away from it.  The film's trapped, desparate and tragically lonely women elicit a good deal of sympathy.  As such, the reality of Wuornos' execution in 2002 seems indicted by its sense of justice.  Regardless of your opinions on the death penalty (and I am against it), however, the facts of this film differ from those which sent Wuornos to death row.  As such, the raw emotions brought about by this excellent film should be tempered with that perspective.On the whole, MONSTER is a nearly flawless film.  As depressing as its subject may be, the emotional intensity is very rewarding experience.  It should become the classic it deserves to be.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Monster Review,"Monster was released in 2003 and was written and directed by Patty Jenkins (Wonder Woman, Wonder Woman 1984). This film is of particular relevance, as it was Jenkins' first debut as a feature film director. Monster has twelve listed producers (among them Charlize Theron, Andreas Grosch, Stewart Hall, and Sammy Lee), with Steven Bernstein serving as cinematographer, and BT providing the score. The film stars Charlize Theron, who won the Academy Award for best actress in a leading role, alongside Christina Ricci, Bruce Dern, and Lee Tergesen. Monster is a crime-drama and biographical account of the life of Aileen Wuornos (Theron), a serial killer whose crimes occurred in Daytona Beach, Florida. Wuornos was a former prostitute who killed seven of her male clients between 1989 and 1990. Wuornos was executed by the state of Florida in 2002.The film opens with a distraught and suicidal Aileen meeting another woman, Selby, while at a gay bar. Aileen insists that she isn't gay, but talks to Selby while the two have a drink. Selby appears taken with the fact that Aileen behaves protectively towards her, and the two women leave the bar together. Aileen and Selby quickly begin a relationship, but Aileen struggles to support them both financially, to Selby's displeasure. The attempts Aileen makes to leave behind prostitution and seek legitimate work are unsuccessful, as she has a prior criminal record and no educational experience. Because of this, potential employers refuse to hire her and are unabashedly hostile. During an encounter with one of her johns, Aileen is brutally beaten, raped, and sodomized, and subsequently kills her attacker in self-defense. From there, we watch Aileen begin down a path of murder, she robs her johns and kills them - using the stolen money to support herself and Selby.Monster does not dispute the fact that Wuornos committed these crimes, nor does Jenkins try to deflect from the brutality of the killings. However, Jenkins' choice to have Theron include a narration throughout the film provides the audience with a different perspective of Wuornos than what would otherwise be available through court documents or newspapers. The audience is able to recognize her crimes, while also acknowledging that she is and has been a victim of horrific abuse at the hands of men throughout her life, including during her childhood. Jenkins enables the audience to be frightened by Aileen, but also to feel some form of compassion towards her (at least that was my experience). Jenkins had corresponded with Wuornos while she was in prison, and Wuornos provided Jenkins and Theron with access to letters she had written to her best friend during her incarceration.After watching Monster, it was evident to me why Theron won the Academy Award for her performance - she was phenomenal and provided a distinct physicality to the role, particularly with her facial expressions and deranged wide-eyed stares. Had I not previously known that she starred in the film, I would not have recognized her as Charlize Theron.I understand why Monster is an important film, and why it is so well regarded in cinema. However, I don't believe I would recommend it to anyone. The graphic brutality and viciousness depicted in scenes of rape and assault made Monster almost unbearable to watch, and I would advise any survivor of sexual assault or abuse to steer clear of this film.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

All Hail Charlize Theron,"Charlize Theron is without a doubt my favourite actress, and one of the finest actresses to grace our screens. She is immensely dedicated to all her roles, no matter how big or small. Charming, funny, intense, heartfelt, all her films boast range and credibility and immediate likability. Young Adult, Mad Max Fury Road, Hancock, Prometheus, Snow White & The Huntsman, these are just a few of her best pieces of work, holding the screen against other big stars and never faltering. It has taken me too long to get to Monster, and finally I've seen it. Holy mother this is a cinematic performance for the ages, Theron completely melds into real life serial killer Aileen Wournos, and it's terrifying and gripping throughout. Ditching her scolding South African-American beauty for a greased up and bruised hooker, this is a performance not to be missed in a film that holds up to the Theron's power. Christina Ricci is absolutely sublime, her best performance in my opinion out of many. With many scenes filled with shock, peril, violence and surprisingly enough heart, Monster is a superb showcase for Theron's screen-dominating talent.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Unjustified,"The filmmaker's avowed intention here was to compensate the media portrayal of Aileen Wuornos - which was supposedly designed to show the public just how evil and worthy of a death sentence she was - by honouring the complexity of a life.Not what happens. Instead we get a complex life reduced to simplicity through an essentially melodramatic mode of presentation, all designed to justify the filmmaker's sympathetic response to the real courtroom events.Everyone knows about Theron's performance. But every other element of the film suffers for it, orchestrated, as they are, to place the focus solely on Theron, and distract from what is really going on behind the camera. Without the strutting performance of Theron, this would be a TV movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Rainman Syndrome Strikes Again,"A film which will be remembered primarily for the physical transformation of Charlize Theron into Aileen Wuornos, the female serial killer who was executed in 2002. I appreciated the bravura acting of Ms. Theron, but it seems to me to be another product of what I call the Rainman Syndrome.someone who takes physical mannerisms and gross caricature in the service of a socially marginalized character (be they mentally or physically handicapped or suffer from some form of psychosis) and builds a performance primarily out of those elements. Throw in some Austin Powers teeth and feathered hair, and you've got the Oscar wrapped up. I also felt the real heart of the story was that of Selby. Here is the true tragedy.a shy young woman who gradually accepts her homosexuality and fights a running battle with her family and peers. She sees the strength and fighting spirit in Wuornos,  and begins to assert herself because of it.  She is marginalized, but she is not a sociopath. Fortunately for her, she comes to realize the depths of Wuornos mental illness and her crimes. She is saved by her social conscience, but Wuornos is not. It is also a tragedy that such a clearly ill woman is executed, but this is only dealt with in a throwaway manner in the film's ultimate scene. I think Ricci's performance is in some ways more touching and heartfelt, subtle and therefore unsung. To me, Wuornos clearly had no chance from the get-go. Although her defiance and desperation were palpable, she really had no where to go once the inciting incident (the first murder) occurred. One annoyance: the rock soundtrack used to underscore the blossoming sexual energy between Theron and Ricci. I felt it was inappropriate to employ the kind of crass manipulative technique which would be more at home in a Joe Eszterhas movie, rather than in a sober portrayal of a real life serial killer.",,Anonymous,Biography
Monster,"Dark and depressing character study elevated by a out of this world performance by Theron. Without a doubt the commitment to her role and Ricci is what make this movie so engaging. Theron's movement, jittery behavior, body language and just all of it honestly, the way her eyes move about. It all works so well for how you'd imagine a paranoid, unstable, conflicted and hurt person would be like. This of course doesn't make anything right after that first kill which was the only one done out of self defense.Directing was decent here, but it felt lackluster regarding editing and music. Especially the music, it was always too kwijt, and it never had a real reason for being there. It sounded like background music just to fill in the silence. Not actually being used to strengthen the scene or moment. Honestly this whole movie would have worked better with zero music to really ground us in this awful little world.I enjoyed feeling conflicted about the main character, even though this might sometimes be more fiction than anything else. Allowing us to see the regretful side and human sides, the flaws, the history, caused just a bit of empathy for this killer. It's not flat out a socio-psychopath. It's more nuanced. You could say this goes for most killers. But not every movie shows it that way.All in all it was good, Theron's performance being the main thing that made this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
who is the monster,"When a film is based on a true story I end up being more interested the real life story. This story is about a female prostitute, Aileen, who kills seven different men after luring them from the Florida highways while promising sex. There is also her partner / lover, Selby, a lesbian, and she is not directly involved with these murders. Throughout the movie we see Aileen's ups and downs, and we get some voice over from her, describing different events in her life. This builds up a psych profile of her, so we can see the reasons behind her violent actions. In the movie, the murders slide from justified to reprehensible, I think this simplifies her character.The character I don't understand is Selby, the movie doesn't explain her actions, but putting it down to child's immaturity doesn't seem right. I think she's a bit fishy and scheming!Violent and depressing movie, with elements of 'good and evil', immaturity, and the failings of social welfare policies.Excellent acting by Aileen and Selby. 3.5 out of 5 stars",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
""" You will never meet someone like me again"".","Last year, I heard we had a South African actress who won an Oscar for doing a good job staring as Aileen Wuornos. And she deserved the Oscar! Here's my review...A film, which was based on a true story which happened in the early 1990s. A tramp , named Alieen Wuornos (Charlize Theron) was out looking for a guy and later bumps into a girl named Selby Wall (Christina Ricci) at a night club. When Aileen met Selby, she was so uptight about Selby buying her a beer and then touching her. And soon, Aileen had no problem with it and she stayed with Selby for the night.Now, Selby was a girl who was sent to go live with her aunt to cure her homosexuality when she tried to kiss a girl in church whereas Aileen was a prostitute. On the following day, Aileen and Selby hit the skating floor and they fell in love without her Aunt's son Trevor (Chad Vaccarino), wasn't looking. Aileen decided to fall in love with Selby because, she was the only person who cared about her.And later, tucked away in the woods. Aileen and this low life taxi driver got drunk. And at that very moment, the taxi driver attacked Aileen due to her not wanting to make love to him. Aileen was knocked out, she then woke up and she discovered her hands were tied up. And when the taxi driver tried to attack Aileen, she broke loose, she the guy and she beat ed him to death! SHE WENT CRAZY!!!!! Then she put on his clothes and she took off with his car.Aileen had to be herself in order to support her's and Selby's relationship. They move in together into a motel. And later, Aileen dumped the taxi driver's body in his car in the middle of nowhere. OH! There was such a funny part when Aileen when to go and apply for a job in order to be a secretary, she got so angry when she didn't get the job. And she swore at everyone! I soon realized that Selby sounded just like my friend Tammy Philpott. That girl, will one day also become as famous as Charlize Theron! Anyways, in another quiet place somewhere, some guy payed Aileen to give him pleasure. She then shot him and she took off with his car. Selby was soon going to discover that Aileen isn't borrowing these cars, she was STEALING them!HA! NO ONE messes with Aileen and Selby!- They were told by a manger of a restaurant (Glenn.R. Wilder) and they rebelled and Aileen knocked the manager down followed by a table.And later that night, Aileen killed another man! And soon she killed another man when she said she didn't need a lift because she was going to take his car. And then, Aileen returned home and told Selby to get packed. Aileen lied again about what she did. Uh-oh!The cops began to track Aileen and Selby down from all the places they passed and all the people they bumped into. And soon, Aileen sent Selby home by bus in order to protect her. Once again, Aileen was on the street. That evening, Aileen walked into a bar and she said she needed to use the telephone. She was taken outside and she got arrested. And she quickly began to change.WOW!!!The next day, Aileen and Selby saw each other again in court. And that was the last time they saw each other. It bought tears to my eyes. As we know, Aileen was executed on the 9th of October, 2002 after 12 years on Florida's Death Row.This film was VERY touching!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Monster or Victim? You Decide,"The 2003 American biographical crime drama Monster is a difficult watch, that is not for the faint of heart (nor is it for audiences under the age of 17, for that matter). Written and directed by Patty Jenkins, and produced by Mark Damon, Brad Wyman, Clark Peterson, Donald Kushner, and leading actress Charlize Theron, this award-winning, box-office success uniquely chronicles the life of Aileen Wuornos, the notorious Daytona Beach area prostitute turned serial killer, by alternating between her love story (yes, you read that right), and her traumatic experiences of both the past and present. Unlike the news and media, who portrayed Wuornos as a psychotic, man-hating lesbian who preyed on each John's for the thrill of it, Jenkins shows her as softer, yet psychologically broken victim of unbelievable cruelty and brutal abuse, who has been failed by society at every stage of her life.Each montage highlights Jenkins' mastery of cinematic techniques such as mise-en-scene, camera movements have such a strong impact on the film, but Charlize Theron's transformation into the embodiment of Wuornos was perhaps the most astounding element. However, as incredible as her transformation was, the many scenes framed with other individuals depicted as living fast and hard highlight expert use of costume design and theatrical make-up. The set design also struck me, in that regardless of many of the set locations being dark, and dingy locations, bright light seemed to always be used to show the focus on the characters facial expressions. Moreover, the use of medium to close range shots as opposed to long range shots helped keep the audiences focus not on the violent actions that were occurring but rather the torment shown through the facial expressions.Though I wish the film came with more of a trigger warning, particularly the intense sexual violence, I found myself captivated by the incredible depth, and level of authenticity given to each character. The use of light and camera angles further highlighted how the non-stop violent trauma Wuornos endured from the past to the present caused her to essentially snap and murder seven Johns in what she felt was self-defense. It all felt incredibly real, which I believe was the effect that Jenkins was going for. At its conclusion, I found myself questioning who is the real monster in this story? Is it Wuornos, or is it society? If you're like me and enjoy a healthy debate, I strongly recommend seeing this film to compare the media's portrayal of Aileen Wuornos, against Jenkins' portrayal, so you too, can decide who, or what, the real monster in this film is.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A monstrously successful outcome at the Oscars do I predict for Charlize,"I loved this movie!  10 / 10.  I'm holding nothing back.  I don't think it's necessarily going to be good for the whoring business along interstates in Florida mind you, but it made one riveting on-screen story.  ""Charlize Theron: You've done it!'  I've followed her career since 'That Thing You Did'.  At first I thought her evil twin was cast in error.  She was on FIRE! Brilliant.  Scary.  Perfecto.Charlize had been script fodder to me . . . filler . a pretty face, nice body to draw the men but without talent of (say_ Meryl Streep's caliber. A few more `reach roles' will be necessary to hit Meryl's stride, but she's on her way .  Independent film tends to draw the best from an actor's ability, taking payroll cash out of the equation.  It separates from pretty, rich faces from the talented pretty, rich faces.  It should be a right of passage for any wannabe star.Now why every theater in Tampa isn't vying to show this film (limited distribution in Tampa at lease) is beyond me.  Yes, this is Florida, and sure - the real Aileen did her felonious mischief only 97 miles away.  But if Psycho was mainstream in 1962, surely 41 years later a real psychotic's behavior is fair game today.The F word is used more often than in Scarface; lesbian sex aka male heaven is prominent(keep the kiddies home), and I think the woman behind me in the theater viewed it as a training video based on her unsolicited commentary of the action.  The genre is somewhere between Thelma and Louise, Psycho and Star Trek . . . the latter only because it boldly goes where only Patty Jenkins hadn't gone before.  A monstrously successful outcome at the Oscars do I predict for Charlize.  Did I mention this was a 10 out of 10?",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The making of a monster isn't as black and white as you may think.,"""In my life, it's always been the harmless stuff that hurts the most. Whereas the things so horrible you can't even imagine it, is usually a lot easier than you think.""Monster is a dark, unpleasant, ugly movie about one of America's first female serial killers. I don't say those things in a negative manner, because those attributes were intentional, and help tell the story in the realistic way that (writer and director) Patty Jenkins was aiming for.I usually have little interest in movies like this, but there were two reasons why it ended up being somewhat worthwhile for me. First, Jenkins tries to show the circumstances of the life and crimes Aileen Wuornos without condemning or excusing her. She was a woman who had lived a life of horrible events and circumstances, and that context helps the movie be more interesting than your average flick about serial killers.The second reason was the performances of the two lead actresses. Both Christina Ricci and Charlize Theron were amazing, but Theron really gave one of those ""once in a lifetime"" performances. She completely disappeared into her character in a way that's incredibly difficult to do for a mega-famous actor or actress. And it took quite a toll on her during filming, which you can see if you check out the special features included with the DVD.As I said, this isn't the kind of movie I usually go for, but it was obvious even to me that Monster is a cut above most movies in the genre. Don't hesitate to check it out if it sounds like something that would interest you, and even if it doesn't, you might want to see it just for the outstanding performances.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Incredible and harrowing story of a real-life serial killer,"'Monster' is based on the life of prostitute and serial killer, Aileen Wuornos, who killed seven men in Florida between 1989-1990 and was executed in 2002.Before watching 'Monster' I knew nothing about Aileen or her story and went in completely blind. Nevertheless, I was enthralled with the film that I immediately switched on Nick Bloomfield's documentary 'Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer' (2003) to see the true story. I now give this review having watched the film and documentary, knowing more about Aileen's crimes.The film follows Aileen from just before she starts committing the murders, providing insight into her lifestyle on the streets as a prostitute and her meeting with her lover, Selby (Chrisitina Ricci) and ends with her conviction. It shows Aileen's relationship with Selby, her desperation to break out of prostitution and inability to keep control of her life. It shows three of the seven murders she committed, and although it is very much a story of a serial killer, the primary focus is on Aileen's motivations.'Monster' is a harrowing tale of a woman who was branded a murderous men-hating wh*** and killed for her crimes. This film tries to go beyond that and digs deeper into Aileen's character and past to explore her personality and her motives. The result is incredible, as it genuinely makes you sympathise with her despite the horrendous and unforgivable crimes she commits. No one will ever truly know why Aileen committed the murders, but 'Monster' makes a convincing case that it was a result of her traumatic up bringing, her experiences of violence from men over the years of working as a prostitute, her inability to integrate into 'normal' society, desperation to provide for the one she loved and a way to take back control of her life in the only way she could. It's sick and twisted, but makes for fascinating film-making.Our intrigue with crime stories and serial killers lies in the looming questions of HOW and WHY. How does a person become so evil that they can take another life? How can they justify their crimes? Why would anyone wish to harm/kill another human being? These are the questions 'Monster' explores and attempts to answer. It's fascinating that in this case the answer doesn't appear to be the simplistic answer we usually hear of ""Because she was evil"" or ""Because she was a psychopath"" but something much more complex. Aileen is a victim as much as perpetrator, a woman that has suffered throughout her life and is afflicted with mental illness which she never receives medical help for. Does that justify her crimes? No way, nothing could ever justify it. But that grey area that 'Monster' explores is what makes this film so interesting.Charlize Theron is INCREDIBLE in her role as Aileen. She lives and breathes the role, quite literally becoming Aileen. Not only does her physical appearance resemble Aileen very closely, but she also has the same mannerisms and impulsive and reckless nature. When watching Charlize as Aileen, it is hard to believe you're truly watching Charlize at all. Generally, when people think of Charlize they think of glamour, beauty and grace, but as Aileen she becomes an ugly, erratic and abhorrent human. She truly deserves all of the awards for pulling this performance out of the hat.Overall, 'Monster' is a thrilling and chilling tale of Aileen's crimes that is thought evoking and harrowing. Charlize's performance makes the film the success that it is and I will remember 'Monster' for many years to come.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

This film has nothing new to say, and nothing new to show. The only reason for all the hype is the fact that you've got an ""A"" lister actress on it. Charleze's physical transformation is amazing and all, but it doesn't change the fact that her acting was all over the place. The facial expressions, the movements- were all exaggerated.

Good drama mainly because of solid performance's.,"Actually when you look closely to this movie it is nothing more than an average drama with a standard visual style and all. It are really the performance's that bring this movie to an higher level and make this movie an impressive drama.Yes, Charlize Theron is excellent! Did she deserved that Oscar? Most definitely! But it also is Christina Ricci who should get lot's of credits for her role as lesbian girl Selby. Both actresses play a role you never expected them to play. Both gained a weight of a significant amount of pounds for their role. I have to admit that before this I never was a real big fan of Christina Ricci but this movie made me look differently at her. It was also great to see Bruce Dern again in a fairly big but quite insignificant role.The story is told in a good way. It doesn't justify Aileen's murders but it helps you understand better what was driven her to commit these horrible murders. Normally we just read about murders in the papers or see it on the news, all we think is that those who commit these murders are horrible monsters but there is always more behind it than meets the eye and this movie shows that perfectly and emotionally.Worth seeing if only for Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

I always liked Charlize Theron as an actress, but this movie proves many new things about her capabilities.

A Monumental Performance by Charlize Theron-A Great Film,"In October 2002 the State of Florida killed serial murderer Aileen Wuornos after she languished on Death Row for a dozen years.  Her guilt was never in serious doubt.  The fascination she held for many is that she was that true rarity of crime annals-the female who sequentially took the lives of men.Historically, some men have always been both fascinated by and perhaps intelligently afraid of women who might kill them.  In the England of the Tudors the greatest crime was treason, a personal affront to the person of the sovereign.  Interestingly, a close runner-up was ""petit treason,"" the murder of a husband by his wife.  In English legal history, morbid accounts of women using their special weapon, poison, appear with bone-chilling regularity.""Monster"" is what could be simply called a biopic of one of America's few known female serial killers (especially those who operate alone.  Homicidal distaff accomplices of men are a dime a dozen.).The Charlize Theron of ""Monster"" isn't the seductive and beautiful woman of ""Sweet November"" or ""The Italian Job.""  Thanks to incredible work by the make-up people she has stepped into Aileen's body and side-by-side photos of the two can lead some to be confused as to who is who.  Theron is a bedraggled, scraggly-haired, unkempt, often drunk vulgarian whose clothes don't fit and whose body almost emanates from the screen a chronically putrid odor.More important than the physical adaptation, Theron has taken on Wuornos's troubled psyche, her mannerisms, her coarse and vulgar speech as if it were her own.  Closely and accurately tracking the last year of Wuornos's life, Theron co-opts viewers for a strange and fearful ride through the near-slums of Florida.Wuornos became a hooker at age thirteen, turning tricks to survive. Apparently she never had a homosexual relationship until she met and teamed up with Selby (not her real name, the imprint of reviewing attorneys being clear).  Christina Ricci is the teenage Selby and she portrays Aileen's young friend and lover with a convincing mix of what the real woman must have been like.  First she's an explorer in the world of gay relationships, then an acolyte of the commanding but affection bestowing older woman, then a manipulative and exploitative spoiled child who is both repelled by her knowledge of the killings but also unwilling to lose a ""sugar mommy."" Ricci's intense Selby is not a nice person.Wuornos began killing with a gun as she unleashed long suppressed hatred of rapacious (literally) men.  Her first shooting, paradoxically, was the only one justified by both law and morality.  The rest were inexcusable on any legal theory (including insanity.  This woman, despite what some have argued, was not psychotic and she was competent to both stand trial and be punished. She demonstrated, as does Theron, a warped but rational view of the state of equal protection law when she cursed the trial judge for sentencing ""a white woman to death."")Selby and Aileen, always called ""Lee,"" are on a perpetual road trip to, in reality, nowhere.  Wuornos feels a net closing in on her but she can't restrain her behavior.  She fantasizes a happy, loving life with Selby even while her demons warn her it won't happen. Theron's projection of this woman who so wanted love and affection from Selby and could only return it in a controlling albeit deep sense is gripping.  Part of her brilliant performance is that she shows the complicated and evanescent moods of the killer.  One minute the audience feels sorry for her plight, the next revulsion at her deeds.The title of the film might well be a simple description of the murdering prostitute.  But it also may be seen as being provocatively ambiguous. Aileen was no monster when her father's friend raped her at age eight.  She was no monster when her father brutally beat her for telling him of the rape, thereby insuring a continuation of the atrocity.  She was no monster when she took up prostitution at age 13, hoping with the demagnetized moral compass of a wounded teenager that she might find a man who would really love and respect her.But some of the men in this film are true monsters and recognizing that in no way alleviates her guilt.  Men who pay for perverted sex and need violence to enjoy physical intimacy: they are as warped as the homicidal hooker who ended their depredations. But, usually, they aren't accountable for their behavior.Theron arrives at a new acting plateau with ""Monster.""    But today only one theater in New York is screening this powerful, monumental work.  It deserves the widest circulation.Theron co-produced ""Monster"" and director Patty Jenkins wrote the screenplay, largely based on police reports, news accounts and - most importantly - Wuornos's letters.I don't think Aileen Wuornos could have been rehabilitated ever.  But I do believe we diminished ourselves by executing a victim of evil and perversion.  Aileen Wuornos in one manner or another was doomed from childhood. And there are many others like her although few will become serial killers.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good make-up does not make a good movie!,"Once again the masses of the world are dumbfounded as they see a sub-par, yet attractive actress get a make-up job to make them appear ugly and are blown away to the point that a mediocre performance wins awards and is considered genius. Well if one can look past the make-up and the lesbian stuff, they would see a crappy actress with a crappy accent, shaking her head a lot like a dumbfounded parrot and talking like the fat old trucker lady from pee-wee's big adventure. Its really embarrassing! I wouldn't mind the film so much if it wasn't so widely embraced.

Is this film fair to men?,"Monster is an excellent film portrayed effectively by Theron. However can we justify the portrayal of Aileen? If this had a been a male serial killer who had suffered a similar abusive childhood as Aileen would we feel any sympathy towards him? I doubt so.This case was so unique, Aileen was often described as the first female serial killer, it seems her abusive childhood has overshadowed what she actually did. She killed numerous men in cold blood and ONE in self defence, if this had been a man killing women in cold blood we would agree that he should be put to death. In a society where equality for women is a sensitive issue, why do we sympathies with Aileen? Her first murder was done purely out of self defence, but the subsequent killings where done purely for money, these men never threatened to rape or kill her. In her final killing a man begs for his life and yet she still kills him in cold blood for doing nothing other than offering her a lift. Can we really say an abusive childhood is an excuse for the violent acts carried out by either men or women?",,Anonymous,Biography

Theron prevents the whole film from tanking completely,"Patty Jenkins' account of Florida serial killer Aileen Wuornos features an Oscar-winning turn from Charlize Theron as the abused highway hooker who bumped off seven of her clients circa 1990 and was finally executed in 2002.On the positive side, more than simple imitation, Theron's remarkable performance demonstrates a significant understanding of her subject  a raw, booze-fuelled mound of defiled femininity, rage and self-pity.On the negative side, the film feels distinctly made-for-TV like and Christina Ricci's performance strikes me as unusually 'off'. Also, Aileen's childhood is rather rudely neglected (with the exception of Aileen talking about it very briefly in one scene in the movie)in favour for a by-numbers telling of her childhood at the start of the film.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Superb Acting,"The main reason I rented MONSTER on DVD is to see for myself why Charlize Theron won the academy award for Best Actress this year (2004). Her being almost a pin up girl (much like Halle Berry), I was really intrigued by what I was gonna get. Well, MONSTER is a truly brilliant picture and it was Charlize Theron's show all the way. Not only did she looked very much like the actual character she was portraying (a round of applause to the make up team)but she literally submerged into the role. It was only at the end of the movie that I suddenly remembered reading something about the real Lee (the killer's real life name)in some magazine a couple of years ago. Christina Ricci was also superb as well as Bruce Dern's brief part. It must've been hard for a woman as beautiful as Charlize to make such a radical role in which her beauty was not required. It goes on to show that this lady will always be Oscar material. As for the movie itself, it is nicely paced, with enough drama to keep things interesting, but if you're looking for the typical hollywood fare, then forget it. This is more like ""indie"" stuff. For those who think this movie tries to explain why Lee Wuorons was the way she was, or that it tries to show some sympathy, they are missing the point. Everytime someone sets foot in deathrow, we only know part of the story, so in a way, MONSTER trys to give that perspective and succeeds at that. It's a raw movie and it's not for everyone. 9* out of 10!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Convoluted Story, Captivating Center","Aileen Wuornos shattered the glass ceiling on female mass murderers, killing seven men she lured into compromising situations in order to support herself and her lesbian lover. Trust Hollywood to celebrate the lesbian and downplay the murders.Charlize Theron certainly deserved her Best Actress Oscar, playing Wuornos as a dopey but empathetic human sponge unable to process the pain life throws at her, only absorb it. It was a total departure from her glamour-girl image that reads like stunt casting but totally sells you long before the film's end. Her brown eyes burn into you like lit cigarettes.I'm less sold on the film itself. It doesn't glorify Wuornos, and in fact strains at credibility to make all but one of her victims not only sympathetic but, occasionally, noble. But the film never really explains why Wuornos killed, except that the seediness of turning tricks on the interstate finally got to her, especially when she found love, represented here by the fictional character Selby Wall (Christina Ricci).Wuornos is the crux of the story, but Selby's the hinge on which the plot must turn, and it's here the film struggles most. Is she an innocent waif, misunderstood by her straight kith and kin? Or is she an enabler and instigator of Wuornos' crimes? Writer-director Patty Jenkins can't seem to decide, and Ricci alternates between interpretations.One minute she is Wuornos' lonely, loyal buddy, gently, doggedly trying to talk sense to her: ""We can be as different as you want to be, but we can't kill people!"" Later she's basically telling her to hurry up and kill someone so they can get a ride out of town. ""This is YOUR plan,"" she whines.On the plus side, other than Theron centering things, is a nice attention to lower-class consumer culture, with ugly t-shirts and corporate rock predominating. ""I love this song"", Wuornos says as Journey's ""Don't Stop Believin'"" plays from the roller rink speakers where she and Selby are enjoying a date. The irony, which Jenkins sets up well, is that believing is just another luxury Wuornos could not afford.I like the opening of the film, too, setting up the despondent mood before Theron even arrives, images of a young girl continually abused until the narration abruptly stops (on the word ""stopped"") to show Wuornos under a bridge right after her last killing. The actors playing the various men Wuornos picks up all bring something unique and interesting to the proceedings.But there was a lot that felt thrown up for effect, like an odd pal played by Bruce Dern ranting about ""circumstance"" and a Christian woman looking after Selby who is played in the typical narrow-minded Hollywood manner. Like I said, the film is divided in its loyalties. That may be understandable, but it reduces what could have been a more effective and complex movie to little more than a stage for Theron. Thanks to Theron, it makes for a decent bargain all the same.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Realistic and depressing,"This is not really a movie one can judge about, as its not entertainment but information and education. If you want to watch it, you really should take your time.They say that Charlize Theron did one of the greatest acting ever in this movie, and indeed I was impressed how completely and perfectly she became a very different person. Unfortunately others here had problems to keep up with her brilliance, most noticeably her movie girlfriend, played by charismatic Christina Ricci.I was also impressed that a movie about a 'Monster' showed not a monster, but instead a very living and understandable human being, tortured by her really horrible life before finally making some really stupid decisions. Indeed, this movie actually contains one of the greatest romantic moments I've ever seen in a movie.I can't help but give this movie full marks and full recommendation.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

It could have just as easily been one of those made for t.v. movies of the week rather than an in-depth look at the tragic life of one of the few women put to death for her crimes in this country and I felt was another example of someone capitalizing on someone else's misfortune.Two out of ten stars.",,Anonymous,Biography

Charlize Theron is Aileen Wuornos,"This movie is based on the tragic life of prostitute and serial killer Aileen Wuornos, played by Charlize Theron. What makes this movie worth watching is the acting, but I'll be honest with you. I always find it hard to agree with the Academy when they give the Oscar for playing such a person as Aileen Wuornos. Charlize Theron absolutely gave an excellent performance, but the fact that she actually won the Academy Award gave me a strange feeling. I had the same feeling when Bobby De Niro won for ""Raging Bull"". Amazing performance as well, but what bothers me is the fact that I didn't feel any sympathy for the person ""Jake La Motta"". Do you know what I mean? When i see an acting performance, I'll like it when I'm touched and moved, when I want to see the whole movie all over again just for the acting.Like I already mentioned, I had the same feeling here as with ""Raging Bull"". Aileen Wuornos isn't a good person at all. She's horrible and incredibly bad. She's a typical low class hooker. But of course, the Academy Award is given for the best acting performance, not for playing the most beautiful role. So was Charlize Theron's performance Oscar-worthy? Absolutely, just look at who she became to play the role. She gained a lot of weight and other changes in order to become Aileen Wuornos.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Theron's Success!,"Another serial killer portrait, and even one based upon a true story, it has been seen before, but there is of course a different angle to this one.Aileen is a women who has lost all hope in life, she spends her afternoons sitting under a bridge with a gun in the hand trying to convince herself life is actually not worth living, she hates everyone, she hates men, she hates the world, there is no love in her, except her only friend, Thomas. One day in a bar she stumples across the young and insecure Selby. Selby is what Aileen was in her young life too, a lost soul. In Selby, Aileen finds love, her soul mate, her force to continue life, but things get complicated when she is forced to take care of Selby and her heart can not make her life the life she lived before Selby came along, after being raped, she kills her first victim, and her hate for men grows.Considering that this movie is based upon a true story, naturally we know the end from the start. The story doesn't bring much new to the genre, everything it as it should be, the strength of the movie is the absolutely terrific portrait of Aileen, given by Charlize Theron. What a triumph this is for Theron, her absolute breakthrough, it's almost sad that she will never be able to play a character this well again, this is near perfection, and it gives the movie all the heart and soul it has, Charlize Theron simply is Monster!Both direction and supporting roles are average of this movie, it's at times rather obvious that the director ain't the most experienced one, sometimes the storytelling slows too much down and makes for some rather boring moments, but overall it works pretty well, but again, it's mostly thank to Charlize Theron. However Christina Ricci also gives a good performance, a performance that is strongest in the start while she is very insecure, her first entrance in the movie, the scene in the bar, that's the best moment for Ricci in this movie.Basically, this movie works good because Charlize Theron gives a performance that will make the audience feel her pain, without feeling that pain, this would have been just another movie, but in the end you can really feel the anger, the confusion, the sorrow. Everything she is feeling, i can't praise her performance enough, i thought Watts should have won the oscar, but now i understand why Theron got it, she is the heart and soul of an entire movie.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

A rather skewed account of a killer hookerwatchable thanks to Theron and Ricci.,"Based on the true story of Aileen Wuornos, man-hating hooker and serial killer, this film is intended to show how society, through lack of care and compassion, can create a monster.Sexually abused as a child, and treated badly by nearly all men ever since, Aileen (Charlize Theron, almost unrecognisable with lank greasy hair, buck teeth and carrying a little extra weight all over) is a prostitute whose hopes and dreams of a normal life have long since been crushed. However, after meeting Selby, a lonely lesbian (Christina Ricci), she develops her first meaningful relationship, and begins to make plans for the future: to quit whoring, get a job, and settle down.But since Aileen's only qualification is a degree in giving head from the University of Life, getting a real job is next to impossible, and pretty soon, she goes back to walking the streets for a living.Then, after one particularly nasty john gets rough, her pent-up anger finally boils over and she shoots the man. Finding his wallet loaded with cash, she realises that she now has a way to get her hands on enough money to enable her and Selby to afford a decent life: all she has to do is kill a few more loathsome customers.Although the film has been lauded by many critics, I found Monster to be a rather unexceptional film, being rather dreary, with an over-long running time, and a script that is seemingly economic with the truth in order to suit its own agenda (from what I have read, Wuornos was far less deserving of pity than is shown in the film, having never actually acted in self defence).However, thanks to a solid central performance from Theron (for which she won an Oscar), and good support from Ricci, who makes a believable dyke, Monster is still worth a watch. Theron's transformation from screen goddess to white trash is truly incredible, and the actress effortlessly manipulates her audience, allowing them to feel sympathy towards her character (we understand her plight and can even forgive her for her actionsat least until she begins to blow away less 'deserving' victims).It is also probably our only chance to get to witness a prolonged tongue session between Theron and Ricci (although both actresses are unfortunately looking far from their best).",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
based on a true story,"A beautiful woman turning herself physically ugly in pursuit of the almighty Oscar is nothing new. When Charlize Theron won the coveted golden statue for her portrayal of Aileen Wuornos, ""America's first female serial killer"", most everyone agreed that it was richly deserved. Indeed, she earned her Oscar for much more than an outer change. Her mannerisms, her voice, her wild-eyed look are all Aileen, all the time. In the beginning credits of Monster, we are given a brief overview of the early life of Aileen. It's a quick montage, and one that's better served if you already have some knowledge of the subject. She had a hard and cruel childhood beset with physical and sexual abuse, was plagued by drugs and brotherly incest, and finally become a prostitute -- and pregnant -- by the age of 13. Aileen eventually left cold and snowy Michigan for the sunny shores of Florida where she became a highway hooker, servicing anyone who'd give her a few dollars. Monster focuses on the 9-month period in 1989 and 1990 during which she had a lesbian relationship with a needy, immature woman named Selby Wall (Christina Ricci, playing a renamed - and by far more beautiful - Tyria Moore) and during which she also began murdering her clientele. In real life, Aileen flip-flopped on whether or not these killings were in self- defense - the movie compromises, showing the first one as self-defense and the rest as murders for money. Although the story of any cold-blooded murderer, and a serial killer in particular, certainly qualifies as ""horror"", Monster focuses on Aileen as a person and what might have driven her to turn her rage outward. The killings are brutal, but not dwelt on or glorified in any way. While I feel that Monster may have been too soft on Aileen's crimes and stumbles here and there on the narrative trail, there's no denying that writer- director Patty Jenkins had a distinct, singular vision and she followed it through from beginning to end. While Theron's stunning transformation and performance sucked up all the accolades, Ricci is also quite wonderful. Her performance is subtle and she's saddled with playing an unlikable character but it's an admirable effort that flies just under the radar. Bruce Dern has a very small but memorable role as an alcoholic war vet, and the superb Pruitt Taylor Vince has a short stint as one of Aileen's johns. Monster shows how a series of betrayals can damage and eventually break an already fragile psyche. Everyone from Aileen's mother (who abandoned her as a baby) to Selby (who ultimately turned her in to the law) betrayed her. One of the final scenes, which depicts the phone call during which Selby entrapped Aileen into confessing, is extremely powerful. Aileen took the fall for everything and absolved Selby -- who was certainly an accomplice toward the end -- of any wrongdoing. Even though it may look like a Hollywood ending, in fact Aileen did take the blame for everything and even went so far as to send Tyria money while she was on death row. In this aspect, Monster offers a rare glimpse into her life as a regular human being; monster or not, she too longed to love and be loved. Monster is often slow and rambling, but it's still essential viewing for anyone who is interested in another dimension of this repellant and fascinating character. And it's definitely worth seeing for Theron, who deserved her Oscar for so much more than just her physical abandon. The DVD extras offer US and International trailers, a Making of featurette (which shows the makeup transformation), two featurettes on the music lauding the composer, BT. Monster is being released in tandem with the 2003 documentary, Alieen: Life & Death of a Serial Killer. Excellent idea, as both films are not only worth watching, they're worth watching together.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
An uneven melodrama saved by the hands of Charlize Theron,"A powerful performance by Charlize Theron.  I never in my life though I would ever say those words.  Dancer/model Theron always struck as me as pretty first, actress second.  It didn't help that she was normally cast in dreadfully mediocre films as a woman in peril: ""The Astronaut's Wife"", ""Sweet November"", and so on.  Her work in ""The Italian Job"" hinted at more ability than she led many to believe, but it's her role in ""Monster"" that reveals to the world that without a doubt, Theron is a power to be reckoned with.Based on the the life of Aileen Wornos, the film begins in the 1980's, when Wornos (Charlize Theron) was a hitch-hiking prostitute.  As the film opens, she's about to kill herself after spending her last money on beer. Unwittingly walking into a gay bar, she meets young, naive Selby (Christina Ricci), who's been sent to live with her aunt in Florida in an effort to cleanse her of her homosexuality.  Aileen, who's never been in a relationship with a woman before, warms up to her.  As their relationship progresses, the two being to believe they're in love, and Aileen resolves to clean her life up and find legitimate work to support them.  After a humiliating series of job interviews, she returns to prostitution.  When one of her johns tries to rape her, Aileen kills him.  This begins a new chapter in her life with Selby, where Selby doesn't ask where Aileen gets her money, and Aileen is filled with a twisted sense of empowerment, killing any john she can in the belief that all of her customers are potential rapists. She went on to become the United States' first female serial killer, and she shot several men before being arrested.But the story of Wornos and Selby is immaterial, really.  The main attraction to this movie is Theron's performance.  Theron also served as producer on the film, and she studied footage and documents on Wornos extensively (the real Wornos was executed in 2002).  Theron disappears so fully into Wornos that even when you look in her eyes, there's no trace of the actress there.  Much has been made of Theron's physical transformation, and it bears repeating.  Theron's Wornos is someone with a soul so broken that it can't help but physically manifest itself.  Model-beautiful Theron has done much to reflect this, including adding a highly unflattering 30 pounds, allowing her hair to become stringy and greasy, and gaining a hard, leathery skin tone.  Add to this an uncanny duplication of Wornos' speech and mannerisms, and Theron's transformation becomes downright chilling in its accuracy.This is both the film's greatest asset and its biggest weakness.  Theron's performance is so amazing, it makes the other actors around her seem unprepared.  Christina Ricci tries her best with the innocent, gullible Selby, but she's too kewpie-doll cute and innocent to make you believe she'd ever spend her life with someone as scarred as Wornos.  At the same time, Theron unwittingly spotlights the wavering, uneven tone of writer/director Patty Jenkins' overall film.  Theron is amazing, but Jenkins never knows quite what to do with her.  Jenkins alternates, sometimes within the same scene, between making us feel sympathy for the damaged Wornos (a victim of childhood abuse, teenage pregnancy, and a prostitute since the age of 13) and making us feel repulsed by the levels of cruelty and abuse she herself can descend to.  Jenkins wants to have it both ways, but she never displays enough evidence to leave the decision up to the audience.  Additionally, the scenes exist out of a clear sense of progression.  We're never sure how much time has passed between scenes, and no attempt is ever made to put the movie into a historical context aside from a few song references and hairstyles. This makes the film seem like it's taking place in a different world altogether as opposed to being set in the real one, starring a cast of people based on real humans.Without the unbridled power and ferocity behind Theron's performance, ""Monster"" would be a highly forgettable, well-intentioned biopic that suffered from a lack of vision.  It's Theron that holds the film together, that serves as its cold heart and its anchor.  Besides being one of the best female performances in a while, it's a revelation of Theron's dedication and ability.  A high recommendation for fans of strong female performances, but for a more coherent story about Wornos, I recommend you check out one of Nick Broomfield's documentaries.  6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Over-the-top and Disastrous,"Although MONSTER is highly-regarded among epic performances, I couldn't help but be utterly disgusted by this movie. (And not in the effective kind of way...) I found this movie extremely difficult to relate to, as for the fact I'm not a psychotic drunk prostitute, and I assume most of you are not either. I felt the intention of this film was to make the watcher feel one thing: Pity. Yes, Aileen had a terrible life, but this movie doesn't make me feel the least bit sorry for her. Frame after frame all that is presented to you is just another terrible event that builds on the pity towards Aileen. It just didn't work for me. It didn't change my perspective on life, it didn't convince me to feel bad for serial killers because they succumb to human nature that was 'brought on by everyone else but themselves.' No life lessons learned here. Why? Because there is nothing to relate to. This film doesn't show you the Aileen before everything went terribly wrong. This was the fatal mistake of MONSTER.Charlize Theron is yes, pretty impressive in this film, but it is NOT award-winning material. It is over-the-top and terribly conceived. As for Christina Ricci, the character she plays is overly naive. Exaggerated to the point of absolute mockery. If you want to see a movie that will have an effect on you, see something you can relate to, like In America, or 21 Grams even. As for this film, the only feeling I left with was an extreme wanting to go take a shower to wash all this bad film-making off me.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Disappointment.,"I knew little about Monster, and the last Theron movie I saw was years ago and I didn't recall what she looked like. I heard good things about the movie and I went with open expectations. Hear me out.1-Unless it's scifi there's no reason to slap gobs of latex on your face to portray a character. If you acting truly is skillful, it will convey the character. I don't think Streep would have used facial appliances.2-Gestures, chainsmoking and frowning do not a performance make. The attempt to physically transform Theron was distracting.Look ma, she looks and fidgets just like Wuarnos! See Cage in Adaptation. The story and acting was so convincing you forgot the 'twin' was fx trickery 5 minutes after his first appearance.3-What was the new direction Monster took? Its still MovieMaking 101,  writer/director must humanize the main characters so the audience will feel for her. Do you really believe she was this 'tortured' individual with her horrible childhood in most of the scenes when she killed? Do you really feel she was sobbing buckets when she murdered the last guy? That her gun, accidentally slipped from her bag, so she had no choice (poor thing) but to kill him? If you do, you've been as manipulated by the writer/director as cleverly as a cold-blooded killer can manipulate you into the secluded woods.To portray Charlize as this insensitive, remorseless killer without makeup, now that would have been a good start to see how good her acting and story holds up.PS after my viewing I did a little www.work on the real killer to see what liberties the writer took with the facts. I'd recommend you do the same.",,Anonymous,Biography
Killings and love,"Charlize Theron displays a stunning performance in Monster, that has doubtless shocked her fans, more used to her baby doll image in The Devil's Advocate or The Astronaut's Wife. She reveals an exquisite talent as she portrays Aileen Wournos, a prostitute that becomes a serial killer (and though many made this assertion, she is not at all as horrendous as shallowly one might say). Feminists will be pleased - the prostitute falls in love with a young lesbian (a sweet and convincing Christina Ricci) and, furthermore, she reaches the conclusion that she has constantly been raped. But it's more than that - Monster is also a film about love, about loneliness and the need to outcome it. For Aileen, life has always been a fiasco and meeting Selby she has the impression she can still put back the pieces in her life and follow her dream (the American dream, naturally - she even says at one moment that she wanted to become the president of the United States); for Selby, running away with Aileen is a strange Bildungsreise, rather a failure than a success (nonetheless, this is arguable, as it depends on the meaning we give to the terms ""failure"" and ""success""). The reasons that constrain Theron's character to turn into a serial killer are a mixture between the Greek tragedy's Moira and the Macbethian choice of the modern individual. There are moments in life when one is not his/her own master anymore - but who is it then? But the paradox for some may be the fact that among all the crimes and blood and debauchery this film is about love and about the fact that love has nothing to do with our common cleavage of Good and Evil.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A transformation into evil a good look at doom and tragedy.,"""Monster"" is for sure one of the most blunt and compelling and provocative and outspoken crime biography movies ever made. Charlize Theron gives her best and very dark transformation work as real life convicted serial killer Aileen Wuornos(in fact Charlize won a best actress Oscar for her portrayal). Wuornos was an interstate highway Florida prostitute who stalked, robbed and did pick up's of men by hitchhiking. Doomed and abused and unloved killing is the only life that Aileen ever knew until she meet Selby Wall(Christina Ricci)a young girl who provided Aileen with a small glimmer of hope and it brought out the other side of Wuornos sexually and that's deep down that she was a bisexual lesbian.Still the blood, pain, and violence was to much to escape as that's the only world that Aileen ever knew as at least seven men had their fate taken by her. As death and the taking of life was the only happiness for this doomed and haunting lady. Overall good crime biography film that stands out due to Charlize Theron's wicked blunt transformation performance.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
American Dreamer,"A grungier version of 'Badlands' - complete with interior monologues - that provides a perfect example of the sort of drab role that involves dressing down, impresses the Academy and wins an Oscar.'Monster' continues in the grand tradition of the Land of the Free's long fascination with serial killers, the irony being Ms Theron killed more people as glamorous hit-ladies Aeon Flux and Atomic Blonde and that real-life serial killers are usually lonely, under-achieving men who can't get a woman motivated by anger at being involuntary celibates - while Wournos (like most lad killers) was motivated by money and the frustrations born of the pressure of living at the bottom of the American heap while her relationship with Christina Ricci showed she was (initially at least) much luckier in love than most of her victims.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
ACADEMY AWARD PERFORMANCES BY THERON & RICCI,Two academy award performances by Theron and Ricci made this picture very enjoyable.  A lot of violence made this screen play very depressing and could have focused on her life story leading up to the unfortunate ending to this story.

"Brilliant, frightening and heartbreaking......",This movie affected me on so many levels. It was so brilliantly done. The performances were intense and so believable I found myself crying in parts. What is a sign of brilliant acting is the fact that Charlize Theron succeeded in making us sympathize with her character despite the fact her character was a cold blooded killer. In fact in the attempted rape scene where she retaliates and murders the man I was silently cheering. To say Charlize Theron deserved that Academy Award is an understatement her performance is so flawlessly brilliant that she's barely recognizable as the blonde beauty she is in real life. This movie is frighteningly brutal in it's honesty. I cannot recommend it enough!,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Good movie, great performance","Charlize Theron's performance is better than the movie itself, and the movie is very good. She plays prostitute Aileen Wuornos who killed seven men in the 1980's. Here is a movie that does not try to justify or condemn the things she did, it just shows us how events happened and in the end we are able to understand most things a little better.This approach makes the movie probably better than if it had taken sides. We see and hear how Aileen's life must have been terrible from a very young age. She was abused and abandoned by people close to her. She has been a prostitute since she was thirteen and now she is through with it, but she meets lesbian Selby (Christina Ricci). Whether Aileen is gay or not does not matter, Selby is the first person in a long time who really cares about her and Aileen feels kind of happy for the first time in her life. But then a client beats and rapes her and she snaps and ends up killing him and after this other clients.The movie could turn into a thriller or a real crime movie, but since it has its focus on Aileen and Selby it turns out to be a dramatic movie, with some really disturbing moments. Although Aileen does things we can not approve of you feel sorry for her almost the entire time. It is Theron's performance that makes sure we do this. In every scene we can read her eyes, see how she feels and what she has been through. Theron won the Oscar for her Aileen and it is hard to argue about that. Ricci does a pretty good job as the naive Selby as well, although you should not compare her with Theron. This is a good movie, made even better by a great performance.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Contemptible,"The childhood of Aileen Wournos is tragic and terrible, But there is nothing sympathetic about adult Aileen Wournos. When Hollywood chose to make the standard, reflexive 'bleeding heart' Oscar-bait movie about her, they were seriously off-track. One can argue from Monster forward, Hollywood never got back on track. If you know about Wournos and her crime spree; she's no protagonist, She was a seriously messed-up, awful, deadly misanthrope.Cristina Ricci is a fictionalized mix of various real people; and plays her as an improbable, one-dimensional cheerleader. Do not ask me, as the viewer to identify with a sociopath (Wournos), when I know all there is to know about the case. She is beneath contempt and now she's down amongst the moles, where she belongs.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

It would have been better if some of the investigation had been shown.Attempts were made to make ""Lee"" a sympathetic character.

Charlize Theron in another light.,"I won't spoil the movie for you all. All I can say is that seeing Charlize Theron play this part must be the most breath-taking moments a person can have whilst watching a movie. She isn't just playing the part, she IS the part.All the characters introduced into the movie were interesting, but, honestly, Charlize steals the lime light in a way I have rarely seen before. She definitely deserved the Oscar. If in doubt and you watch this movie for the sole reason of finding out whether she deserved it or not, please... Watch It.The storyline and plot is perfectly paced to ensure you are neither bored or too overwhelmed. Over all, a fantastic movie with a lot of meaning.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Charlize Theron totally elevates this film,"My Rating: *** out of ****.Give her the Oscar already. It is so obvious that Charlize Theron will win the Best Actress Oscar in 26 Days. Not only because she is a pretty girl that was able to look ugly. But it is because her performance is absolutely powerful. From beginning to end, she is Aileen Wurnos.So what about the rest of the film? Well, Monster is an effective and compelling film. However, the reason it is effective and compelling is for Charlize Theron. Without Theron this movie would be ok at best. I found the script to be mediocre. I really felt that Charlize made the film into something worthwhile.One of the problems with the film is the Theron's voiceover. When used at the beginning it is fine. However, it seemed rather pointless and distracting the rest of the time. Her voiceover at the end came off a bit corny.I should praise the make-up crew. Charlize was unrecognizable, although I never found Aileen to be a hideous looking woman. She was no Charlize but still I found her to be an overweight but somewhat attractive woman.The only other actor to have significant screentime is Christina Ricci. Ricci does gives a good performance but she is completely upstaged by Theron. However, they do exhibit some chemistry together. The rest of the cast was forgettable, well Bruce Dern was sort of memorable despite not much screentime.This is the debut film of Patty Jenkins. She was the writer and director of the film. Her screenplay is not remotely interesting and her direction is fine at best. Her job was to make sure that the film was never boring and to make sure Charlize completely WOWED us. She achieved those well(She may be able to do more on her next project). Monster is certainly not one of the years best films and without Charlize this film would be mediocre at best. However, Charlize elevates this film to a higher level and she has 26 days till she receives her Oscar.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Charlize Theron devoured that character!,"Based on true events, it tells the story of a prostitute who becomes a serial killer. This film has multiple interesting themes that make you reflect such as social determinism, free will, alienation, the stigmatization of prostitution work and the women who do such work, etc. One of the things I liked the most was the role of Charlize Theron, who basically devoured that character (she won the Oscar for best leading actress for that role)",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Monster: The Tragic Path of a Tormented Being,"Monster was a movie directed by Patty Jenkins and released on December 17, 2003. This movie is a thriller crime film drama that touches on the life of the protagonist Aileen Wuornos who is a character played by the multiple award winning actress .Charlize Theron. The film tells the history of Wuornos as she traverses her way from rough childhood to a tragic life as a serial killer. Set on the backdrop of Florida, Monster explores the harsh truths of Aileen's life. She is a person who was abandoned and abused. These traumatic experiences then caused her to grow self-alienated and desperate for love and acceptance. The crucial turn in the film's plot comes when Aileen meets Selby Wall, a young girl looking for a connection in her own right. Their relations lord the reality of a promising future for Aileen. But soon this leads to a nightmare, brought on by her fight for survival with a surge of violence.A factor that stands out in this film is Charlize Theron's impactful acting. Charlize was able to communicate Aileen's raw vulnerability in her character's pain, anger and desperation, through her acting she was able to showcase this to the audience watching this movie. Charlize's acting in this film was transformative physical and emotional core won her the Academy Award for Best Actress. The second leading actress Christina Ricci shines equally well with all the innocence, which states the contrast between Aileen's wrath.The director of this film Patty Jenkins really manages a compassionate yet ruthless connection, balancing aspects of Aileen's humanity and horrific actions that she performs. In this movie brutality isn't filtered; rather, it illuminates through a humane approach to the struggles in Aileen's life to find sympathy rather than shocking mere inclusion. The unfiltration of this aspect of brutality made it better for the audience to grasp the realness of the message the director Patty wants to convey to the audience.Cinematography and score balance the emotional gravity, immersing the audience in Aileen's intensely chaotic world, made even more compelling by the overwhelming tragedies that helped create it in the present. Monster makes its audiences aware of the predicaments of morality, love, and existence itself. It poses haunting questions of where society failed Aileen, making it more than the story of a crime.In conclusion, ""Monster"" is a terrifying reminder of the depths of human sorrow and the desire for connection. It is a strong, thought-provoking movie that stays with you long after the credits have rolled.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Blonds don't have more fun,"Personally, I'm not a big fan of multi-hyped and large budgeted Hollywood productions, but you can always wake me up for accurate and unsentimental portraits of serial killers! Despite the big names and promotional campaigns that were involved, Patty Jenkins' ""Monster"" easily could have been such a truthful portrait. Aileen Wuornos' story is certainly one worth telling, as she was one of the first  and definitely the most famous  female serial killer in recent American history. And yes, the screenplay is fairly accurate in telling her evolution from neglected teenager into male-hating and remorseless murderess, but of course it totally isn't unsentimental and that's why ""Monster"" is never at one point as powerful as cult movie classics such as ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"" (about Henry Lee Lucas) or ""Deranged, Confessions of a Necrophile"" (about Wisconsin killer Ed Gein). The production values were better, naturally, and the acting performances truly are perplexing, yet this film soon begins to obtrude sentiments of sympathy and compassion and eventually it's Patty Jenkins who decides for us what to think of Aileen. Daytona Beach prostitute Aileen Wuornos is suicidal when she hooks up with young lesbian Selby in a sober gay bar. She convinces the naive girl to run away with her as they can easily live on the money she makes selling her body to customers she refers to as ""Johns"". Aileen is very afraid when she impulsively kills a guy after an attempted rape and it even brings her closer to Selby. The next murders she commits, however, can never be justified and both girls are doomed to run from one lousy motel room to the next. Charlize Theron is terrific, as you've heard, but Christina Ricci's performance is equally impressive and the least she deserved was to be nominated for an Oscar as well. The narration is unnecessary and the film becomes rather dull and repetitive after an hour. The ending was a bit of a letdown as well, as it comes rather abrupt. Overall, ""Monster"" is a shockingly mediocre film.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great argument for the death penalty,"""Monster"" is the dramatized story of real-life serial killer Aileen Wuornos, who was executed in Florida for her crimes in 2002 after spending 12 years on death row.  The film does not ""pre-quel"" her killing spree or spend any time whatsoever on her prison time.  It tells only the story of her killing and relationship with her lesbian girlfriend Selby.I really didn't know how to react to this story.  It seemed to play both sides of the fence in its perspective toward Aileen, sometimes sympathetic sometimes horrified.  What I can say for sure is that there will be a great deal of hyperbole in the entertainment media that will praise the appearance of Charlize Theron in her resemblance to the real Aileen; it is eerily on the money.  The  thematic elements of the story itself have been told before in earlier films.  Forbidden lovers on a real life killing rampage?  Try renting ""Badlands.""  Lost lesbians short on brains and cash looking to get away from it all and start a new life together?  Try ""Boys don't Cry.""  Whatever elements are to be realized from this story, they are unapologetically sordid and the movie wallows in them.  A.W.'s victims were typically middle class 60-something white males, well dressed and driving nice cars, wearing their wedding rings for the world to see.  It is obvious she is symbolically killing her abusive father, but we never get to see this man.  All we hear is Aileen's version of him.In summary I can't say this story needed to be told.  True crime stories are inherently fascinating especially when it is intertwined with a large dose of sex.  Do you ever drive by a bad car accident and gawk, hoping to see a dead body?  Then you get my point.  If there had been some concrete reason to understand and gain at least a glimmer of sympathy for this devil, I could recommend this movie.  There wasn't, so I can't.",,Anonymous,Biography
Theron earned that Oscar.,"Not being very familiar with the true story behind this film, I'll opt out of judging its veracity in terms of objectively defining Wuornos' character.However - Charlize Theron has indelibly stamped her mark on the shortlist of actresses who truly morph into each new role. Meryl Streep, for example.The film, for all its shortcomings, is riveting, mainly by virtue of Theron's portrayal. Christina Ricci and Bruce Dern are notable, as well. The seamy, downscale side of Florida is well represented, as is the unrelenting desperation of its down-and-out underclass.It's a film worth watching several times. The dialogue is sometimes slightly muddled and hard to follow, simply because Theron is so absorbed in being Wuornos, she doesn't always enunciate well enough to be understood.I'd like to have seen a bit more fleshing out of her background and the process that led up to her death sentence. The major flaw in the whole premise may have been that it was told entirely from her POV -- which causes some dissonance between the person we see and her ultimate fate, which comes across as quite unfair. As another reviewer said, she couldn't have been just another ""misunderstood bad guy."" None of the above detracts from Theron's work here. Her range is the stuff of legends./r",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
You will sympathize and relate to the character,"as played by Charlize Theron; that is how you know a good film has been produced, without the usual stereotypes and violence.When we do see violence, it is depicted realistically. For example, when Aileen Wuornos is raped. It seems that she initially kills for self-defense; she is basically working as a prostitute on the main highways in Florida, so that she can survive.Sadly touching is when she tries to apply for a job in a law office: while she has no skills, she tries to straighten out her life, to no avail. It is shown how society fosters the demise of those without any resources; she has no one to help her; and is also taken advantage of by a local police officer.Another pivotal scene is when Christina Ricci is arguing with her aunt; Christina plays Ty (pseudonym Selby, in the movie), Wuornos' friend. Her aunt lectures ...""these people can't be helped... or we'd all go 'round killing' people or doing drugs just cause we had a mean mom""... She also says they would all be better if they ...""found the light"".... This accurately reflects society's denial and judgmental attitude when it comes to any rehabilitation or nature/nurture debates.It is easier for society to blame the individual, Aileen Wuornos, than to examine the psychological cause and effect of her upbringing; it is a fact that she was raped by her own father as a child, and her mother abandoned her to the streets at age 13 when she was impregnated. Many of these facts would have been worth exploring (For example, how does her mother live with herself, now), but perhaps the length and flow of the film was a factor.I hope that we see another film with similar subject matter in the near future!. Aileen Wuornos was executed, and society helped her get there. This is not simply a ""liberal"" viewpoint; it is a humane point of view.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Heartbreaking and horrifying in equal meaaure,"I only watched this film for the first time, twenty years after it's release.A simply superlative and beyond outstanding performance by Theron. Few actors and actresses could deliver on such a role and I still find it hard to believe this was actually Charlize Theron playing this role. For once, the Oscars got it right and she most deservedly won Oscar for best actress. Virginia Ricci, as her lover, also put in a spellbinding performance.Female serial killers are extremely rare but the background to Aileen Wouros' life is staggeringly horrific and I am sure many viewers will have shed tears along the way.It is believed by neurosurgeons and specialist psychiatrists that three exceptionally rare genes in the brain need to to be activated to set off the path of a serial killer. One of these genes is a 'violence' gene which was probably activated in Wouros at a very young age. The others followed years later. Once all three genes are activated, there is no going back. The serial killer will keep on killing until stopped.This is an exceptionally harrowing and incredibly depressing film to watch. But I would urge those yet to watch this incredible film to do so. It will give at the very least a glimpse into those in the gutters of society who also deserve to be loved and treated with kindness and compassion. Just like the rest of us.If for nothing else, then watch for a performance from Theron in particular, which surely will be remembered for years and years to come...",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL.,"I'm guessing critics have ""Lord of the Rings syndrome."" This is where a film comes out that is really bad, but no one wants to be the first person to say how bad it is. So, everyone just copies. I love crime-dramas and true crime, but this movie was so bad, I wanted to walk out. And not just once, almost a dozen times. The only real star in this movie is the make-up applied to Charlize Theron. Is she good? Eh. Alright at best. I think she peaked in 2 DAYS IN THE VALLEY. She has mannerisms and voice down, but doesn't remain consistent. Her narrative voice-over appears to be her own voice, separating it from the rest of the film.  Not much even seems to happen in this film. For a movie about a serial killer, there is miniscule violence. Maybe the director was just trying to push the gay angle. Who knows.

Except For Theron's Acting This Movie Was Horrible And Depressing.,"I can't believe I got forced to watch this movie! First off it is a very depressing movie, Second of all it was depressing, and third of all it was depressing. I gotta commend Charlize Theron who did an excellent job, I dont know how such a beauty got transformed into such an ugly woman, she reminded me of beetlejuice, and then the whole lesbian romance made it disgusting!

Theron's Oscar Was Well Deserved,"Ugly and uncomfortable to watch, ""Monster"" is the first true crime movie since ""Dead Man Walking"" to leave me feeling utterly broken inside. Aileen Wuornos was a sad and pathetic creature whose past made her into what she became and Charlize Theron brings every complex dimension of her completely to life again in this film. It wasn't just the makeup and added pounds that made Theron into Wuornos but her uncannily accurate portrayal of the woman who was lost between the horror of her personal life and the dreams she had to be somebody more than her circumstances dictated. Theron almost seems to be inhabited by the soul of Aileen Wuornos with every word, body movement and tormented and crazed wide-eyed look. Her performance certainly deserved the Best Actress Oscar for this role and possibly of the decade. The music by BT adds another suitably eerie dimension to the film but it is really Theron's performance of the wonderful screenplay that makes this a great film. There's really not any gore to speak of, but the raw and bottom-line truth of Wuornos' life is what makes the story nearly unpalatable. Guaranteed, this movie will sicken, frighten, sadden and make you squirm. If it doesn't, you should check to see if you still have a pulse. Undoubtedly not for the faint of heart but if you do see it be prepared for an unparalleled ride.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Compelling, quite possibly the best movie ever made.","There are no words to describe how mesmerising Patty Jenkins' 'Monster' really is. From the first time I seen it, I was hooked. I love it. I adore it. The story of Aileen Wuornoss is one that I have always been familiar with and the most refreshing thing, I found, was how careful 'Monster' was not to judge Aileen. Instead, it allowed us to see the story that lead up to the killings and the difficult life Aileen had. Although this does not justify what she did - it is a heartbreaking though that she actually killed seven men out of the love she had for another woman. I find it admirable. Charlize Theron gave - in my opinion - the most dazzling, gripping performance in cinematic history. I cannot express enough how outstanding I find this film and all aspects of it. The score is beautiful. BT - who I would've never have guessed would be the kinda guy to do it - had me in tears. ""Don't Stop Believin'"" by Journey is a song that will always remind me of Monster; of the greatest love story I have ever seen. I would like to take this space to thank Patty Jenkins for making such a revelation. It is my fvaourite film and one which I will never tire of watching. It hits me evry time I see Aileen and Selby rollerskating or waiting on the bus for Selby to go back home what a beautiful story this is. I love it. I cannot say that enough. Patty Jenkins you are a pearl among women, of which there are few.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent acting.,"First, let me make it perfectly clear - I found this movie to be well acted and fascinating. I certainly recommend it as a interesting dramatization of the the life of a very disturbed person. Yet, let us not forget for a moment that the woman in question was a serial killer who was not only a victim but a victimizer as well, who committed vicious acts of violence that went way beyond any rational explanation for what she did or why. Ms. Charlize Theron's performance was incredibly powerful and poignant, as she portrays a woman whose unrequited quest for love and never-ending rejection of her by society is transformed into an all-consuming and uncontrollable rage. Normally, such a character would not evoke feelings of sympathy, but Ms. Theron manages to do so. It's a remarkable piece of acting. But, please, just remember that it's only a movie, and the movie is a drama that offers a story that may not be consistent with the facts.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Complex script, great acting- but highly fictionalized","""Monster"" is a great film, very well written & acted...but it is really NOT the story of Eileen Wuornos. If you know the facts, you will be disappointed, so I suggest that you just view the film as a study of how a dysfunctional life can lead to hatred, madness & rationalized murder.Eileen Wuornos, as portrayed in this movie, is much more sympathetic than her real-life counterpart seemed to be.  Because we see intimate, unknowable moments dramatized on the screen, a ""character"" begins to take shape, a very sympathetic-but-ruthless character.The love story between the two women is largely fictional.  The ""waif"" nature of her lover (Christina Ricci's character) is highly an invention, as is her helpless, jobless lesbian identity.  In reality she was working as a hotel maid and GAVE UP her job to let Wuornos support her as a prostitute. When the killings began, Eileen Wuornos was very up front and matter-of-fact about them to her real lover (who merely asked to be kept in the dark about them so that she wouldn't feel guilty and thus the urge to turn Eileen in).Many things have been smoothed over to make the film's character sympathetic to the audience.  This is handled very well in the film; in fact, the script seems to address just about every argument one could make about Eileen Wuornos' character.  There is a telling scene with Eileen's only constant friend (played by the great Bruce Dern) about the nature of ""blaming"" circumstance for our inevitable actions.I highly recommend this film, but if you really want to know more about the reality, I suggest searching the 'Net for the true details.",,Anonymous,Biography
Absolutely stunning!,"I'd have to say, with all respect to everybody involved in the real events, that this is absolutely the ""best"" real serial killer movie I've seen so far. I guess there are only two which come close to this: ""Ed Gein - In the light of the moon"" and ""John Wayne Gacey - To catch a killer"".The performance of the lead actress and also the close resemblance to the real person was so freaking stunning that, had I not looked up her movie history on this site, I'd have believed she'd be the real Aileen Wuornos!!! And I mean that and what I think you should know: I am extremely peckish about saying things like that! Absolutely stunning performance! Did she ever get an Oscar for that role? Well she sure deserved one!However, I am not all to sure about the accuracy of most of the dialogs and such. But thats mainly because obviously I don't know where the movie makers got all that information from. But who knows, maybe Mrs. Wuornos told that stuff to somebody while she was on death row. But whatever, I really have to say that whatever the details of all the conversations might have been in real life, they sure braught you a lot of insight about the person and what made her tick... or not tick. The only scene I can clearly point out to be inaccurate was the arrest. Because not only obviously, but also factually, was it never the undercover cops which got her arrested! They were only there to keep her in place and check her out in case she'd slip up and say something about the murders. So when the arrest was underway the undercover policemen were arrested just like her, to keep the cover up! She never said anything about the murders, so the police coudn't completely prove it was her, until they got her girlfriend to agree to the staged phonecall you see in the end. After that she told the police herself and confessed to the murders.I would also have expected Wuornos to be a bit easier to get much more angry, but I wouldn't know if my image of that is correct. Anyway, seeing this movie made me almost feel sorry for her. I'd twice previously watched the discovery program about her. In that program it was much easier to identify her as some kind of psychological freak, but on the other hand was that documentary seen out of the polices viewpoint, not really from hers. I'm not saying that I understand any of her actions, but it's just that through the movie at least I can feel some sympathy for the reasons why she was so screwed up.I have to say this again - and Mrs. Theron if, by any chance, you're reading this... your performance was absolutely mind blasting!I'd be more than surprised if she just played that part out of her sleeve so to speak! I'd much rather believe that she really put herself into Wuornos shoes, trying to be her even off set (at least partially and only mentally of course), because that is the only way I'd understand why she played her part so well!A well deserved 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

It wasn't like Aileen Wournos was a boring person but she just was just a stupid messed up woman who had a rough life. As great as the acting was on Therons part, the part wasn't as complex to play. It was like we are watching the life of a Jerry Springer guest! Christina Riccis character was much more interesting. Her infatuation with this ugly hooker was compelling in the sense of why? Why? Even after she found out she was with a killer, she stayed with her out of pity and her own lack of self-esteem. Bruce Dern is getting good at playing old geezers, I guess because he is getting old!

"Biopic of Aileen Wuornos, serial killer.","Mind blowing performance by Charlize Theron, as Aileen Wuornos - highway prostitute and serial killer.This film succeeds in inspiring sympathy for a woman who was vilified in the American press as a 'Monster', showing that there are two sides to every story.It also provided an excellent example of why the death penalty does not work as a deterrent.Christina Ricci played Aileen's girlfriend, Selby, who was not in real life as young and pretty as Ricci. But I agree with comments made by Jenkins that ultimately this was a film that had to make money at the end of the day, and a young, pretty character was far more 'watchable' and provided a startling contrast to the less savoury character of Wuornos, as played by Theron.",,Anonymous,Biography

Jenkins shows us the raw emotion of Wuornos as a human being,"It's a startling story, rocking the news of the time and showing a very different side of what we've all been taught about street walkers. Patty Jenkins delivers a script that shows Wuornos from a very human, very painful perspective that we can't help but have some sympathy for despite how Wuornos' suffering took her to such a dark place.This film does not ask us to reflect on how the johns lives were affected, at least not to a great extent. It's solely about Aileen descending into the monster she became and how she sacrificed her chance to go free so that her lover could try to have some semblance of a normal life.In the trivia section, we find that the true girlfriend was not forthcoming about her story and asked not to be identified (while ironically her name is placed in the trivia section), so I have to assume this is based only on Aileen's perspective.Theron's performance is truly poignant. She's unrecognizable and I think few actors have what it takes to throw themselves into such a role with such commitment. I'm reminded of Bette Davis and Jack Nicolson level acting. One review found her so unrecognizable they even thought Theron was wearing false teeth. But a review of photos over the years indicates that is not the case.Ricci was very believable in her role, as well. Although her part didn't require as big a commitment to an unexpected character.In a sense, the title is juxtaposed to the authentic human being introduced here.9 stars for tremendous acting and attention to detail on the set designs.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Top Three Performance of All Time - Monster,"This biopic is based on a true story; an unbelievably tragic and true story. The performance of Charlize Theron is one of the top three performances I have ever seen by an actress. I have seen over 20,000 films. The direction is perfect; the production values are perfect. The script is hair-raising and tragic. And as terrible as this woman's crimes were, there was an excellent case for her not to get the death penalty. The film is mesmerizing from beginning to end. Each actor, Bruce Dern and Christina Ritchie are letter-perfect. The story is dark and depressing and makes most noir movies look like Disney films in comparison. Patty Jenkins has produced a film that reached heights that neither she, nor Charlize Theron will ever reach again. They will both make many more talented projects; but none will ever reach the height of this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Ugly yourself up, win an Oscar","Oscar voters love it when performers transform themselves into something as far away as possible from who they really are. Charlize Theron is not crazy, is stunningly beautiful and I rather doubt she will ever kill seven people. So playing a crazy, ugly serial killer gets her an Oscar. Never mind the fact the movie isn't any good. Yes, Theron undergoes a stunning transformation. And it certainly took some serious acting talent for her to pull off this role. She's believable as notorious murderer Aileen Wuornos. But you'd like to think winning an Oscar would require more than just being believable in a role that doesn't suit you at all. Especially when, however good your performance may be perceived to be, the movie itself fails rather miserably.Monster suffers from a severe lack of drama. OK, so it's a true story and we know from the beginning exactly where this is headed. But there have been plenty of movies based on true stories which, even though you knew their ultimate destination, have been throughly compelling and entertaining. Sadly that is far from being the case here. This movie is mind-numbingly boring. There are only two characters even worth mentioning. One of course is Aileen, the other is her little lesbian lover Selby who spends the whole movie following Aileen around like a pathetic, clueless little puppy dog. Poor Christina Ricci is saddled with this part, the character is such a total zero there was never really any chance for Ricci to make anything of it. She really has nothing to do, it is Theron's movie through and through. And that brings its own problems. First off the layers of ugly makeup slathered all over her face look ridiculous. For much of this movie Aileen doesn't even look human. With all that gunk on her face it's nearly impossible to see Theron emote at all. Her face is a blank, ugly slate. Note to future filmmakers: if you want to make a movie about a notably unattractive woman perhaps best to not cast one of the world's most beautiful women in the role. All the effort required to make Theron look hideous ends up hurting the film. Quite frankly, she looks ridiculous. Theron certainly gives a game effort, trying so hard to be something she so obviously is not. But the way she carries herself, all her exaggerated mannerisms in trying to show how uncomfortable Aileen Wuornos was in her own skin, it just doesn't work. If you have to try this hard to appear awkward and ungainly perhaps this isn't the role for you. The movie is also hurt by the director's obvious, and obviously misguided, attempt to turn Aileen Wuornos into a a sympathetic figure. This effort fails miserably. You don't feel sympathy for the character. Honestly the movie is such a snooze you really don't feel much of anything at all. But if you did, sympathy for this monstrous murderer would certainly not be the prevailing emotion. The only good thing you can say about this movie is that Theron took on an incredible challenge and that she did about as well as could be expected with it. But it's not the stuff of Oscar dreams. And the movie as a whole is a nightmare.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
HOW DOES THIS CRAP GET GOOD REVIEW?!?!?!,"This is one of the worst films I have ever wasted my time with.  I cannot believe people actually think this flick is an enjoyable ""work of art"".  Am I supposed to have an emotional connection with this hooker?  NO!  I do not fell sorry for this whore!  She killed people to get ahead.  The only scene that could have picked this movie up was the Ricci/Thereron lesbian scene to Crimson and Clover by the Velvet Underground.  But instead, I can never listen to that song again. This movie is a worthless piece of crap.  I would like for someone to grow some balls and back me up on this but instead, I'm more than likeley going to get bogged down by people telling me I'm wrong.  But those of you who gave this movie above 3 stars, don't ever vote again.  I ask you this-WHAT MADE THIS FILM GOOD?  Thereron won an oscar for becoming ugly.  Just like Kidman for the Hours.  Horrible politics in Hollywood.  I didn't know if I should laugh at Thereons hick performance.  It looked like a bad standup act!  One of the worst I have ever seen.   0/10****",,Anonymous,Biography
Beyond excellent,"Charlize Theron should have a shrine dedicated to her, for the work she did in this movie. I would have to say that this one of the top five best performances ever given by an actress, or actor for that matter.Based on actual events, the story is set in Daytona Beach, FL, in the early 1990's. A poor-white female in her mid-thirties, ends up at a gay bar by mistake one night, just in hopes to have a drink. She meets Selby (Ricci), who offers to buy her a beer. Several hours later, the two become friendly, and Selby offers to have Lee (Theron), stay the night with her, since she has no home. The prostitute with no real job, money or place to stay accepts. The next evening they meet again, and begin their romantic relationship.Through a series of events, Lee, the prostitute turned lesbian, turns to murder and thievery, to keep herself alive, and her relationship with Selby as well.It is one of the best films to ever come out, not just in 2004. It will make you cry, and feel emotion for the loss, sacrifice, and hardships that the characters go through. It is an emotional ride through the eyes of a mentally tormented woman, and how she deals with the situations she is given in life.Charlize Theron, again was brilliant in this, and Christina Ricci was also profoundly well casted and her poignant moments in the piece as well.Definitely not a film for anyone under eighteen, but I would recommend it to anyone over that age. It's a film you don't want to miss, and is well worth the rental fee.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Hit and miss,"Well acted and heart wrenching but totally inaccurate.One thing that stood out to me was the almost apologetic portrayal of Therons character. Quite seemingly brave to attempt this, until you realise it was completely fabricated. Not once in all the films made about real male serial killers has Hollywood attempted to make them sympathetic characters, and with good reason, they were monsters, and so was Wuornos. None of the films made about male serial killers showed lengthy scenes involving their abusive parents or upbringing. The horrible acts committed against them never put centre stage. When portraying the stories of John Gasey or Ted Bundy I don't remember a violent beating or rape, despite many of the most notorious male serial killers having been abused themselves.To concentrate on this to make the audience sympathetic does a severe disservice to the memory of her victims, and this demonstrates the stark contrast to so many films of a similar nature. Reversing the gender of the killer speaks to a dishonesty and political bias within mainstream media to portray women as victims and men as attackers.Jenkins took the time to include the phrase based on true events but distorted the truth to suit her own agenda. While the film is well made, it is hard to ignore these biases, especially in an age when feminism has done it's best to create a war between the sexes under the facade of equality.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Truly Outstanding. Can't Get This Movie Out Of My Head,Monster has got to be one of the best movies I have ever seen. And Charlize Theron blew me away as the lead character. She was totally believable throughout the entire movie. This movie is riveting. It will hold your attention from beginning to end.I left this film feeling very sad that a person's life could be such hell and then to have it end by being put to death. This is a very honest film that such shows the ugly side of humanity in so many ways. This movie will stick in my head for a long time to come.

Charlize is the real thing!,"I was entranced by Charlize Theron's impersonation of Aileen Wuornos in this film. She carried home an entire shelf full of awards for her performance and she earned every single one of them. The prosthetic makeup that transformed the gorgeous actress into a bedraggled, weather-beaten street person was uncannily good at recreating Wuornos's crooked teeth; and the vocal similarity between the fictional and the actual Aileens was striking.Christina Ricci played an equally impressive part as the rejected lesbian, whom Wuornos latched onto after being abused and rejected by so many others. But this film was all Carlize and she dominated it. She was so convincing that she virtually disappeared and I saw Wuornos back from the dead on the screen. Eiree.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Theron's greatest role,"Was blown away by Charlize in this movie, she is a truly magnificently talented actress who makes you forget there is a beautiful and glamorous South African model under there.

Aileen = Monster,"Charlize Theron's performance was amazing, (definitely deserved that Oscar)!!! Along with her visual transformation. If it didn't say her name in the credits, I'm not sure I would have known it was her. She gained weight for the role and shaved her eyebrowns in order to look the part, and it really did pay off.I was already familar with Alieen 'Lee' Wuornos's story prior to watching the film, just from a more pyschological viewpoint. So it was interesting to get deeper into the ways and reasonings behind why she did all those killings on the silver screen.The most interesting part for me was watching as Lee develope throughout the film. In the beginning she was very recluse, with in her own words, not a reason to continue living. That changes when Selby enters her life, and Lee lets someone into her heart in probably a long time. Their relationship dynamic is an interesting one, with Lee taking on the more masculine parts (bread winner, protector, etc.) and Selby the feminine parts.The thing that bothered me though, is how they paint Lee as the victim through out the entire film. Don't get me wrong, it's hard not to feel bad for her since she's had a pretty rough life pretty much since birth. Never was fully wanted by her family, was abused and raped since a very young age, and was eventually kicked out of the house at 13, with her only means of survival being prostitute. But at the same time, did ALL 7 of the men she she killed deserve to die? You can see in the movie that she tries her best to work herself up, to trick herself into believing that she was doing the right thing (Ex: One of her 'customers' wants her to call him 'Daddy', so she belives he likes little children). On more then one occassion, the men she eventually kills attempts to help her, offering her cash or to drive her to a motel.I think Lee knew that her murder spree wasn't going to last long, and it didn't, since she was eventually caught and sentenced to death. When I got to that part of the movie, (contradictary to my last paragraph) I wasn't relieved to see she was getting her do. But I wasn't broken up about it either. If I had to put it into words, I felt somewhere in the middle of the two.Overall I really liked this film, along with it's dark and heavy themes.**SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER***Even though body bloody still got to see Charlize boobs :):):)Aileen got lethal injection on October, 9 2002.

Where is Charlize Theron?,"*-Watch it on TV **-Worth a Rental ***-Buy Used DVD ****-Worthy of a Blind BuyI want to make one thing perfectly clear about the film Monster. Charlize Theron is not in it! Seeing her become Aileen Wuornos was breathtaking. I am not sure that I agree with Roger Ebert's assessment that it is the greatest performance in the history of cinema (or something to that effect) simply because I have not seen every performance in the history of cinema. I can say that Theron's performance is one of the most transforming and magnificent performances I have ever seen. Not that it should completely overshadow Christina Ricci's performance, it shouldn't. Ricci gave an extremely convincing performance of the sad, lonely lesbian who falls for Aileen.There is a scene where Aileen is telling Selby her plans of getting a job and providing for her. You really feel hopeful for her as she struggles to get a job and leave her prostitution days behind her. Of course you know what is eventually going to happy and (atleast I) couldn't help feeling sorry for her. I was very satisfied with this film. Patty Jenkins did a tremendous job of bringing this amazing true story to the screen. The way she tells the story makes you feel almost sorry for Aileen in her situation as she tries to provide for Selby. But at the same time you despise her for being the title character. I give this film ****. I will definitely be buying this soon and I feel that it is absolutely worthy of a blind buy.",,Anonymous,Biography
Theron's performance is as powerful as it is intriguing,"Films take on an extra power when they show us something we can't seem to believe. Such is Charlize Theron's performance as ""America's first female serial killer,"" Aileen Wuornos, in ""Monster."" Transformation blows us away, and to see a blond Australian bombshell become a homely bisexual prostitute-turned-murderer reminds us of the power that a performance can have on a film.Patty Jenkins' drama shouldn't come across as a character study as much as it does, but when your lead performance sucks in such an overwhelming amount of attention, it becomes all about how awestricken the audience is at that transformative turn. At the same time, Theron's performance also inflates the film a great deal, covering up some pacing weaknesses and a love story that never quite makes sense.It's hard, however, not to be distracted by Aileen, the completely disheartening yet fascinating character Jenkins and Theron have crafted. A hooker ever since she was physically able, Aileen is especially self-sufficient and — even if misguidedly — self-confident. She's unafraid to speak her mind and surprisingly smart on her feet when her brashness lands her in trouble.But things get extremely complicated when Aileen meets Selby (Christina Ricci), a lesbian loner who takes a liking to Aileen's somewhat masculine demeanor. When Aileen starts to reciprocate those feelings, her life begins to change, and it does even more so when she's forced to kill a man who picked her up and attempted to rape her.Jenkins provides a number of intriguing psychological insights into Aileen. As she discovers the added benefits of killing the men she solicits sex to (revenge, a sense of fulfillment, money and the ability to try and forge a future for herself and Selby), we get an even greater sense of who she was, and more importantly, what motivated her. It's enough to understand exactly why she did it, even though her actions are nearly impossible to condone.The construction of this psychological profile takes a good deal away from the journey of Aileen and Selby's relationship, which should come across more as the core of the story considering how big of a role it plays in forcing Aileen into this spiral that she can't undo despite her conscience.A lot of that comes from Selby's end, as the attention on Aileen makes it harder to understand Selby's motivations for climbing in with Aileen as deep as she does. Ricci gives an honest and likable performance; we believe that she's just naive enough to run away with Aileen but smart enough to know she needs to be a bit cautious. As things hit the fan for Aileen, however, we seem to lose that access to Selby, which is the character we are expected to identify with more.With Theron, the complete disguise of the makeup job certainly inflates the extent to which we believe she is giving us an incredible performance, but as you start to adjust to the brown contacts, nasty teeth and 30 extra pounds, you see Theron's brilliance comes from within. She shows a true commitment to the psychological disaster that her character had to have been in order to do what she did. Although the character is written brilliantly, this is not the kind of Oscar-winning performance in which the role won the award instead of the actor. Not just anyone could've done it.As a whole, ""Monster"" gets a bit dicey. The scene writing is quite powerful. Given the nature of Aileen as a character and Theron's execution of it, you feel as if at any moment something of serious dramatic consequence might occur and it usually does. Jenkins really captures the emotions of each scene too, whether its love, fear, hate, etc.The struggle comes from the whole, as ""Monster"" drags at times. There's a ""Thelma & Louise"" nature to the story, yet constantly we come across reminders that the action of the story is static. These women aren't actually on the run — they're just hiding frantically. The plot kind of goes in cycles with each new cycle bringing us closer and closer to their likely demise. We feel those stakes and Aileen and Selby have natural (albeit agitating) reactions to when things go awry, but it's tough to stay engaged when their actions will have such obvious consequences.But that's kind of the point. There's never a concerted effort on Aileen's end to lie or get away with anything. She is nothing if not honest, and we respect the hell out of her for it. We want to scream at her when she says that she never had a choice to become who she became, but we understand why she feels so powerless, and that unlikely sense of empathy makes ""Monster"" a strong film.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Do NOT watch this if you are feeling depressed,"This movie is great. Depressing but great.Charlize Theron won a ton of awards for her performance and if it were my choice, I'd give her twice as many! She was unbelievable. A hooker trying to survive in a world that (metaphorically) had killed her long before she gets executed. I don't know how closely this movie follows the real story, but it's riveting.Now, this is not the type of movie that I plan on seeing again anytime soon. But I did buy the DVD because it's worth watching several times. I just think that I need a year between viewings to catch my breath! The acting by the rest of the cast is pretty darn good too.

One of the greatest transformations by an actor/actress I've ever seen,"Roger Ebert in his review of Monster said "" this is one of the greatest performances in cinema history."" After watching this film, I can say while that statement's a little much, Charlize Theron has provided us with the most amazing transformation in movie history. I've seen others like Heath Ledger's extraordinary portrayal of the Joker and Anthony Hopkins' all-time horror show as Dr. Hannibal Lecter. However neither film had me feeling hurt for the villain, in the way Theron portrayed Aileen Wuornos. she didn't kill for the thrill of it like the Joker and Lecter, but she killed because she felt she was protecting other people from suffering like she had at the hands of society. Theron fiercely and passionately shows us Wuornos' actions as a repurcussion for society's blissful ignorance of her need for help and acceptance as a person not as a trophy men can win and forget about in a day's time. Theron and Ricci give amazing performances and I can't believe Ricci or Toni G. the make-up artist didn't get Oscar nods in their own right. But it's Theron who makes the movie what it is and she deserves all the credit for creating the most amazing transformation in cinematic history.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

What a mess,"""Americ's worst female serial killer"" it said in the TV mag.I'd never heard of this person and after watching it I thought it was just another excuse to fill the movie with foul language.If you try and count the number of F and S words you lose count in the first 20 minutes. As for the killings only 3 were shown yet if this movie had been done right you'd at least have heard gunshots.So no logic here. Instead we get stuff which should have been left out-like Ailleen's attempts to get a job when she thinks she can become a secretary in 5 minutes!! At the beginning she tells her friend she has a dry cleaning business or something but as we never see it we know this is a woman who lies non stop . I know America has low lifes like this-so have we-yet when you realise this person is the subject of a book and a movie that's more than obviously deserving people have-Gene Pitney or Carole King to name but 2.

persuasive sexist excercise...,I must admit that I knew what I was going to get when I sat down to watch Monster.. not because anyone had told me but because I know Hollywood and the kind of films it puts out. I didn't know that the writer-director was a woman but I wasn't surprised. What was surprising was how persuasive the film was..which is unfortunate in some ways because it's attempt to portray Wurnos's story as a love story is embarrassing when you know the facts. Theron does give an excellent performance and look remarkably like Wurnos'... I just can't figure out why they couldn't make Ricci up to look more like her real life counterpart. It is this kind of intellectual dishonesty ( like leaving out that Wurnos killed most of her victims by posing as a disabled motorist in need of help) that truly mark the film. How fascinating that America's first female serial killer turns out to really be a victim herself...how could it have been any other way? How sexist... unless of course the director is thinking of making a film about the family friend who repeatedly raped Wurnos when she was 8 with the same kind of empathy.

As a theater/directing major, this movie was amazing, especially what Charlize went through to be able to portray Aileen, it was to the point of why Aileen did what she did, unfortunately, many people who have been abused or raped try to hide.

Theron delivers a powerhouse performance,"Charlize Theron gives a powerful performance as Aileen Wournos a prostitute turned serial killer, who falls in love with Selby, played by Christina Ricci. Charlene brilliantly brings out Aileen's almost bi-polar like conflicted personality. Patty Jenkins does a great job in having Theron wear no makeup and eliciting the raw emotion from Theron in her portrayal of Wournos. Wournos' outbursts in the film are at a pure manic level. It is hard not to sympathize with Wournos who is so conflicted in killing most of her victims (except the first, where it is more self-defense). Wournos desperately wants to be a good person, and when she meets Selby, she finally believes she can make it happen despite her troubled past. Both Wournos and Selby are so eager to be loved that their dependence on each other ends up being almost toxic. As the relationship becomes more toxic Wournos is led to commit more murders to keep her relationship with Selby going.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Not a popcorn film, leave it in the lobby","Monster is a deeply affecting film based on the unbelievably sad life of Aileen Wuornos, whose tragic story is done justice here by writer/director Patty Jenkins and Charlize Theron, who portrays Wuornos (known as ""Lee"" in the film) with dazzlingly fearless abandon. I have always been a fan of Theron's, and I'm very pleased to see her getting such fantastic praise for this performance. Surely she will at least receive an Oscar nomination, and Christina Ricci is equally deserving; she nails her character Selby (based on the real-life Tyria Moore) brilliantly as well.The thing that makes this movie more than just another ""based on a true story"" melodrama is the rawness and truth of its emotional core - here we have a woman, raped and abused from childhood on who sees no other options for herself but to become a hooker, brutally marginalized by society, whose life is just one long series of bewildered confusion (although she believes she sees things very clearly in her deluded state), who meets someone (Tyria/Selby) that needs HER, someone she believes she can invest all her love in (and she does have a lot of love to give). Unfortunately her mind is far too warped by this point, and it doesn't help that Selby (in the film) is a complete emotional cripple, a virtual black hole of need, and this is what eventually undoes the situation.-=- POSSIBLE SPOILERS -=- Ironically, Selby ultimately betrays Lee in what she believes to be an act of survival, which is what, if nothing else, she has learned from Lee, and even more ironic is the fact that Lee, the ultimate survivor (living through abuse, rape, brutality of every kind, years of prostitution and more) is not able to survive love.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
What if Thelma & Louise was based on a true story?,"Monster is a film about self discovery; it's about friendship and the gruelling reality of life and how it can hit those when they least expect it. Aileen (Theron) doesn't start out a serial killer in Monster but due to unforeseen events, sort of becomes one; Selby (Ricci) doesn't start out a girl in a large, wide world full of life experience but due to unforeseen events, you bet she is by the end of the film through realising food doesn't put itself on the table and money doesn't grow on trees and this forms the basis of the film Monster; a film directed by a woman, about women and about finding out who or what certain people really are.It's probably been noticed before I'm saying it here but Monster really reminded me of Ridley Scott's 1991 film Thelma & Louise; a film in itself an entertaining and unpredictable one about self discovery and 'dates with destiny'. One outlining problem I had with that film was its lack of commitment towards its content; it should have been a dark film revolving around dark matter but it remained light and upbeat thanks to the constant innocence of its leads and the friendly county music that popped up every now and again. In Monster, I have found the film I wanted Thelma & Louise to be  a darker tale about two women on the run.I would go so far as to say that Monster actually feels like a remake of Thelma & Louise. Firstly, you have the two leads who are complete binary opposites: Aileen is the lead, almost hard bodied, character who is a trickster, a liar and a prostitute whereas Selby is the angelic sidekick who lives at home and still has other kids as friends: there is also a sweet camera shot where Selby looks into a mirror and smiles at herself which although quick is by no means insignificant - if Selby is Thelma then Aileen is Louise. Secondly, it's Selby who runs away against her family's wish just as Thelma did in the other film but this time instead of running away from a domineering husband she is attempting to, perhaps wrongfully to some, escape her mother and father. Thirdly, the initial incident that sparks the film into life is an attempted rape on one of the girls; funnily enough it's the Aileen/Louise character and Aileen reacts in the exact same way Louise did. The difference here is that in Monster, she is actually raped whilst being bound in the car's front seat with the repercussions of her rape evident later on in the film when she showers but Thelma & Louise, being not as dark, was a lot more straightforward and a lot less bloodthirsty.Another thing that Monster does in a much more detailed and analytical manner is its study of the characters. Thelma and Louise were both relatively recognisable characters whom instead of starting out 'bad', merely progressed to that stage. We aren't told of Thelma's 'past incidents' but in Monster, we not only know what Aileen does but we get to see her do it, ie; being picked up at various points and discussing types of sex and costs. What disturbed me here and what made it clearly identifiable over Thelma & Louise was that Monster makes Aileen out to be rather masculine or at least gives her masculine traits. I already mentioned she is hard bodied but she is very unattractive, talks and acts like man and doesn't dress particularly glamorously  this twinned with the fact she is a lesbian means that she would go for girls if faced with the chance, something the male subconscious apparently thinks about every dozen seconds or so. There is also the matter relating to the cast on Selby's arm. Although seemingly random and insignificant; whenever the cast remains on, arguments and disagreements are never far away  to me, it felt like a part of home was still attached to Selby but what's interesting is that as soon as the cast comes off; Selby and Aileen have sex: she is now free and has 'cast off' any lingering feelings of doubt about the situation. No, it's not a coincidence her arm heals by the time Selby and Aileen reach that stage of their relationship.Amongst all the analysis of gender and comparisons to Thelma & Louise, Monster remains a dark and bleak film with a captivating story and two very, very fine pieces of acting. There is a definite atmosphere of chance; a hopeless feeling that eventually, everything will not be alright. The film's dark approach and dark subject matter is not tampered with like in Scott's 1991 road movie and it was pleasing to have such a film that didn't have many 'laughs' or secondary characters to sometimes cut to whenever the film felt like it. Monster is clever and interesting film-making that although relies on previous efforts, still manages to feel fresh.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Powerful Film with Haunting Performances,"Monster (2003)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Charlize Theron won the Best Actress Oscar for her performance of Aileen Wuornos, a prostitute turned serial killer. In our film we start off seeing Aileen as she's struggling to make it and finally sees a way to a happy life when she meets a confused gay girl named Selby (Christina Ricci). The two eventually fall in love but in order to keep the money flow coming in Aileen continues to be a hooker but soon she's also killing the men. MONSTER is a pretty depressing and powerful movie that features some of the best performances you're going to see in this type of film. If you're looking for something uplifting or something that's going to end with a high note then it's best that you stay away from this film. While it's often hard to watch there's no denying that it has some power, is extremely well-made and also features some terrific performances. Director Patty Jenkins really did a terrific job at telling this story and she also brought a certain atmosphere to the picture that just made it so realistic that it really did feel as if you were watching a documentary. You certainly have to give the director credit for never trying to spin a happy note on the picture because there's simply no way around this type of subject matter and thankfully the director went for the truth and not some phony pretty stuff. Ricci turns in a remarkably confined and powerful performance as the rather naive girl who gets pulled along in this mess simply because she's gay, comes from a small town and has no friends. I thought the actress did a very good job in the role and sold it ever step of the way. Bruce Dern, Scott Wilson and Pruitt Taylor Vince also turn in strong work in smaller roles. Then there's Theron who turns in a remarkable performance and you could easily and rightfully say one of the best that you're ever going to see. The make-up work is incredible because to turn such a beautiful women into this person was remarkable but even without this the performance stands on its own. Not for a single second do you ever see or feel a beautiful woman uglying herself down to do a part. Instead you see and feel this character who is so multi-layered and tortured that you can't help but be scared of her. Theron really gives it her all and she's quite creepy and sad at the same time. The performance just contains so much raw energy and passion that you forget you're watching a movie. The one negative thing about the film is that there are a few too many times where I think they showed the character as a victim. There are moments where it appears they want you to feel sorry for what has happened to her and you can to a point. However, there are many people who have the same stuff happen to them and they don't go on a killing rampage. With that said, there's no question that MONSTER is quite powerful and the performances alone make it a must see.",,Anonymous,Biography
Extremely Well Done But Extremely Unsavory,"In 1992 Aileen Wuornos (1956-2002) stood trial for the murder of Richard Mallory in Florida. Clearly dangerous and disturbed, Wuornos was an extremely belligerent, aggressive personality, and her frequent outbursts and several bizarre circumstances turned the trial into a media circus. Convicted of Mallory's death, Wuornos also confessed to the murders of six others and remains a suspect in at least two unsolved homicides. She was executed in 2002.But for all the drama of the 1992 trial, MONSTER sidesteps this aspect of the Wuornos story. It instead focuses on Wuornos herself and her relationship with lover Selby (in real life Tyria J. Moore, the name change likely due to legal issues.) And while it plays fast and loose with the facts--particularly re the Selby character--it offers a relentlessly fearsome portrait of an incredibly damaged woman whose rage twists into a vicious killing spree.Charlize Theron, previously better known for good looks than acting skill, gives an inspired performance as Wuornos, seeming to inhabit the character; it is truly frightening to watch her. Although the script's Selby is hardly in the same league with real-life Tyria J. Moore, Ricci too is quite fine--a mixture of innocence and soullessness that is often quite as disturbing as Theron's more flamboyant performance. The supporting cast is also very good, with Bruce Dern notable as a biker friend and Scott Wilson particularly memorable as Wuornos' final victim.When I saw the film in theatrical release I found quite a few audience members walked out on the film in disgust. And for all the power of the performances and the great artistry of the film, this is likely to be a real issue for any one who sees MONSTER. The film does an extraordinary job of making us see Wuornos and Selby as human beings--and as pitiful human beings whose lives were largely warped and twisted by circumstance rather than personal choice. Even so, both characters are dangerous, mean, manipulative, and vicious in different ways, and our pity for them will not stretch far enough to cover that.In the final analysis, I do recommend the film. But before you rush to see it simply because it picked up a well-deserved Academy Award for Theron, you might do well to ask yourself: do I really want to know these people? And if you are unsure, you'd probably do better to give it a miss--for you might well be one of the people walking out midway through.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A powerful movie, tremendous acting, not ""Pretty Woman"" in the least.","A riveting portrayal of pathetic yet tragic ""lost soul"" who is impossibly isolated, deluded, and kicked adrift from the rigid constraints and safety of ""normal"" life (yet all the while yearning for some form of acceptance and normalcy). Theron is amazing in the lead role, and Ricci shines as the misfit lesbian. If you've never taken the time to be thankful for what you have, this movie will make you stop and realize it could be worse, a lot worse. The acting is gritty and totally believable. Theron alternately captures the fear, frustration, and utter helplessness of the down-and-out prostitute's situation - a dreamer, a loser, full of suppressed self-loathing and flash-point anger. The movie may be a little too sympathetic in it's portrayal of a killer, and manipulative in the use of some stinging (some would say stereotyped) social commentary, but it resounds with a sense of reality, truth, and even remorse. A tremendously powerful movie that should cause you to reflect - this is not ""Pretty Woman"".",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Utterly inaccurate and disrespectful,"You couldn't get a more inaccurate story if you tried. Aside from Charlize Therons acting there is nothing good about this film. The writer clearly did not decide to actually research this case fully at all, the disrespect shown to the VICTIMS is obscene, I would suggest anyone who believes this load of rubbish seriously just watch the casual criminalist for an accurate and thoroughly researched piece. DO NOT think this is a true story, it's made up beyond belief. Certain names have been changed even though this is supposed to be true, the killer is depicted as never being bi sexual except there are YEARS of evidence of her living with her partner! Worst though are the facts that are warped and twisted depending on the writers whims, the killers version of events are used as fact which is disgusting when you think she claimed all her killings were in self defence, sometimes, disgusting as the victims are shown as evil and deserving in some cases!! SHOCKING, EVIL, AND VILE. That's the writing for this shocking film.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
No Redeeming Social Value Whatsoever,"I'm truly sorry I watched this film.  I do think Charlize Theron's performance was incredible as far as acting goes.  But this film is just a sick, twisted depressing story about a very unfortunately messed-up individual and her naive and confused lover.  The director called it a ""love story.""  If Aileen Wuornos had ever known how to love, she probably would not have been sentenced to death!If this film did anything for me, it made me realize how blessed I am that in spite of my troubles and trials, I have Christ in my life and a family that loves and supports me.  I don't say this out of self-righteousness or holier-than-thou arrogance.  I truly wish Aileen Wuornos and her girlfriend had had these things.",,Anonymous,Biography
One of the best movies ever made.,"I did not especially want to see this movie at first, but I did so because of my wife's interest and because of my curiosity about Charlize Theron's Oscar-winning performance. ""Monster"" pulls you into the story immediately and never breaks the spell. Patty Jenkins, the writer/director, shows you the world of serial killer Aileen Wuornos through Aileen's eyes. The storytelling is magnificently done, with every detail adding to the effect. All of the acting in the film is first-rate, with believable, realistic people. Charlize Theron, however, delivers one of the finest performances, male or female, ever captured on film. Before seeing the movie, I wondered if her Oscar might be Hollywood politics or just a ""Wow"" vote that someone so beautiful could be made to look so unattractive. Only minutes into the film, however, I completely lost any sense of Charlize Theron and lost any wonder at the artistry of the makeup person. Ms. Theron simply IS Aileen Wuornos. Her mannerisms, her voice -- everything! The effect is of watching a well-made documentary rather than a Hollywood movie. After the film was over, and I reflected on what I had just seen, I knew that Ms. Theron had given one of the finest performances ever. She ""overcame"" her beauty to create someone else who is a totally different person. This is acting at its finest. She is deserving of mention with the very best: Meryl Streep, Dustin Hoffman, Laurence Olivier, and just a few others. The excellent work of Christina Ricci, Bruce Dern, and the other actors should not be minimized, either. The entire film is most notable for the way that it tells its story seamlessly, without ever seeming to be anything other than a documentary of a real life. ""Monster"" is truly a masterpiece of cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Powerful,"Theron received an Oscar for her performance, and well deserved. As the trivia indicated, she was uncooperative, so knowing how much of the story is real or spliced in is difficult. She described herself as a real good person, just trying to survive. Sexually assaulted at age 9, which continued for years, and when found out, she was beaten for that. So that formed her life, one of degradation and rock bottom. She had hopes for herself, but totally unrealistic. She meets Selby in a gay bar, and they hook up. Selby, being gay, naive and living in a Bible heavy home was also put in a horrible position. After being heavily beaten up in setting up a 'trick', she resolved to not let that happen again. And when the dirty cop pulled her over, and then demanded a 'favor', it showed how alone someone like her is.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Tough to put into words how this movie makes you feel.,"I just finished watching Monster and was emotionally blocked by it.The movie is easy enough to explain. A woman who has had a terrible childhood and life of parental abuse and drugs is ready to kill herself with a gun on a rain soaked highway. She became a child prostitute at 13 in order to survive and get away from her pain.Now an adult, life has brought her to Florida. Her childhood dream was to become a movie star or somebody rich and beautiful like the women on TV, but suddenly that dream has stopped. She feels that she has nothing left, but to spend the last $5 she ""earned"" before desperately ending it all.But before she can complete her tragic deed, her prayers are answered as faith steps in. At a bar, she meets Selby, a young girl of 18 trying to deal with her coming lesbianism. As the main character, Aileen narrates her personal story up to this point. She says of their first meeting: ""By the time I met Selby Wall. Sh*t all I wanted was a beer."" As human beings, we are all looking for love and want to be wanted. Aileen isn't any different. She needs to raise money right away in order to be with Selby, and resumes her hooking. This time with newfound purpose the viewer can observe. However, she ends up in an unfortunate, brutal encounter with a rapist and killer. She survives by killing her attacker, but afterward the strong emotions carry her away like an ocean tide. The drama builds.Charlize Theron's portrayal of Aileen is such that you want her to get a break somewhere; To get her life moving in the right direction. Invigorated by Selby, she wants to taste some sweet success in her life. She is happy that she met Selby, and discovered something in herself that she was lacking -- love. But try as she might, she experiences difficulties trying to get a decent job and fulfilling dreams of a normal life. Frustrated, she lets her emotions get the better of her and slips back into the darkness.Aileen goes back to earning a living as a hooker servicing the needs and desires of men on a highway. But after her justified killing incident, she is changed forever. Aileen becomes a killer and robber trying to motivate herself by remembering the first time. This transformation is disturbing and makes the viewer squirm in their seat.The rest of the movie focuses on Aileen and her girl friend Selby. They are happy and go on dates. The roller skating scene is sweet and memorable. As they become familiar with each other, they fight and argue. Selby's father and step mother put pressure on her to stop seeing her ""prostitute"" friend and go work for her father. Struggling to accept her sexuality and adulthood, Selby rebels and decides Aileen will help her discover herself. The viewer is put through a gamut of emotions putting themselves in the character's shoes and remembering the experiences they've themselves had growing up.Aileen continues her new way to ""earn"" money so both could survive. They go out and have adventures, one which involves an accident in a dead man's car that Aileen has stolen. Selby make new friends and Aileen worries. They lie, cheat and hurt each other. They love and make love. The characters make you feel each moment of their lives. The killing of a good Samaritan by Aileen is poignant and very sad. Aileen doesn't want to do this killing, but knows she has to or else the victim will report her to the police. Aileen's adrenaline pumping killing spree finally catches up with her and Selby. The police have gotten a sketch of the pair (from the car accident) and both are scared of capture and worried. Selby is sent away by Aileen. It is a tearful goodbye at the bus station as they may never see each other again if one or both are captured. Aileen should ready herself to finally leave Florida, but she ends up at a bar trying to get a moment's relief from her pain. Aileen is caught by undercover police in a trap they've set, sent to jail and tried.In the end, I wasn't sad that Aileen was sentenced to die, but was moved that something wasn't done to help her earlier. Aileen gets frustrated and bashed by events as she has been most of her life. Thus, she makes the unfortunate choice of a life of crime and evading capture. Even Aileen's last phone conversation with Selby is fraught with doubt and we see that she is indeed being set up. At the trial, we end up seeing Aileen has discovered and experienced love, but found betrayal at the same time.Monster, based on true story, ends as a tragedy as Aileen plaintively states: ""Love conquers all. Every cloud has a silver lining. Faith can move mountains. Love will always find a way. Everything happens for a reason. Where there is life, there is hope."" (laughs) ""Oh, well... They gotta tell you something.""",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Terrible Movie,Give me a break. One of the worst movies I seen in a long time. It was a very poorly made movie. Movie is boring and lack any depth. There was no flow to the movie. Plotline or lack of plotline was sketchy. Most of the scenes were meaningless and unrewarding. The movie did not show or prove the title beyond one line that was made. How was she a monster? Nothing impressive or worth remembering beyond the makeup.This could have been a much better movie. It was the makeup and weight gain that got Charlize Theron the oscar. Her acting was not good in this movie. It is more like a bad made for TV movie.,1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Surprisingly Good but Theron is Too Attractive.,"Lurid but extremely interesting story about a man hating street hooker with lesbian tendencies who befriends a young woman and falls in love with her. The hooker also has a tendency toward murdering her ""johns"" and you will see why early on in the film.This movie is supposed to be about a real life prostitute/serial killer Aileen Wournos portrayed by Charize Theron.  I think it succeeds in being a very gripping drama and providing a psychological profile of this woman. I was not disinterested at anypoint in the film.The film's only flaw in my opinion is that despite the fact Ms. Theron won an Oscar for this film, she is so attractive in real life, the make up she used in the film to make her ""ugly"" did not succeed all the way.A disturbing and compelling film.

What a messed up, pathetic and scarred character. Her sidekick Ricci is also messed up but at the other extreme. And any movie that features both REO Speedwagon and Journey on the soundtrack has to be respected. What I most liked about Monster was the expert direction.

I never watched the entire movie and tuned out about 40 minutes in. Surprisingly my wife did not watch the rest of the movie either, this from someone who watches every movie to completion. She deleted the movie and did not even FF to the end! Charlize really did look like that monster, but why? There was no need to do the bra & panty shots. She could have worn the same outfits and completed this role with out the weight gain. This was not the tremendous work that De Niro pulled off in Raging Bull!",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good acting but why?,"Having seen this movie for the first time recently a few things came through my mind. Firstly the acting performances. Christina Ricci and Bruce Dern were superb in their respective roles but i was disappointed by Charlize Theron's role. OK sure looked like the women and maybe got the killers mannerisms down to a T, but i just felt that it was lacking something.Also, i thought that the movie was trying to get us, the viewer, to sympathize with Aileen Wuoros plight, playing sad music during killing and in the end, but lets not forgot that the women was a serial killer and thus why should be sympathies with her? We don't care about Charles Manson, Peter Sutcliffe or Dr Harold Shipman(when he was alive) and they were all serial killers? Should they get a big budget movie made about them, then we will all be like ""the system failed them, blah, blah, blah"".Overall the movie was full of good performances but the attempted sympathy attraction ruined it for me.I would give it a 3 out of 5",,Anonymous,Biography
The critics were quite right this time,"I think I don't have to tell you that the critics all loved this movie. It won some important prizes and for some of them that's already enough to praise it into the heavens. However, the only problem that I have with such movies is that I start expecting the impossible. Believing that this will be a movie like I've never seen before, I regularly end up being very disappointed in it. That's also the main reason why I waited a couple of years after the release before seeing this movie.""Monster"" has been based on the life of Aileen Wuornos, a prostitute who became one of America's first female serial killers. After having suffered from abuse and a drug addiction as a thirteen year old child, she has started to work as a highway prostitute. When she decides that it is time to end her life, she meets a young lesbian named Selby, with whom she starts a relationship. At first all seems to get better, but than she starts murdering her clients so she doesn't need to have sex with them in order to gain some money. For nine months everything seems to go smooth, but than she is arrested and convicted...I have to admit that Charlize Theron did a very nice job and I'm convinced that her performance was worth the Oscar, but personally I think Christina Ricci was very good as well. Perhaps not everybody takes her very serious since her role in movies like the ""Adams Family"", but in ""Monster"" she proves to be a very fine actress. But some good acting isn't enough to save the entire movie of course, it needs a good story as well. Normally you could expect a very preachy and dramatic TV-movie like script, you know the kind that will only attempt to make you cry your eyes out. Not this time. This one has been written by someone who knew what she was doing. It doesn't judge and doesn't force you to swallow the opinion of the writer / director. It leaves you enough room to think and judge for yourself and I really appreciated that in this movie. All in all this is a very nice movie that certainly deserves to be watched. It's perhaps not the masterpiece some critics will make of it, but it certainly deserves a 7.5/10, perhaps even an 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Unbelievable,"As a stereotypical butch lesbian, very few things in this world make me cry, and for once in my life I am not ashamed to say that I was bawling my eyes out by the conclusion of this stunning movie. I pushed play without knowing a single thing about the movie, unknowing how I would be touched by this brilliant piece of artwork. The raw emotion expressed in the movie was a magnificent display of talent and heart. I honestly doubt that anyone who was in anyway involved with this movie walked away unmoved. This marvelous story opened my eyes to a whole new level of love, a whole new meaning of the word. When you can feel so strongly about someone that you are willing to kill to make them happy, you know you've reached a higher level of emotional attachment. This movie explored an amazing life. It's to bad she had to be betrayed so many times in her life. I wish I had been given the chance to meet Ms. W in person to tell her how amazing she really was. This woman's life and the way it was so touchingly documented has moved me in unbelievable ways. Kudos to everyone involved with this movie.-Rei",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"MASTERPIECE, A MOTION PICTURE PERFECTION","It is rare, in the world we live in, to see a film of such tremendous accomplishment shine on the screen in theatres around the world.

Terribly Overrated,"I must be in the minority, but I've got a couple gripes about this movie.First, this movie is too long. It's not ""deep"" enough of a movie to be nearly 2 hours long. 20 minutes could have easily been cut out of it. Some scenes drag on, with boring conversation about things that don't make me feel for or understand the characters more.Second, if a beautiful Charlize Theron hadn't been uglied up for her part, this movie would have been subjected to the B-Movie bin. The movie looks like it was shot on a shoestring budget, and doesn't have the feel a movie with this subject matter should have. They spent a lot on makeup, not enough on set design and ""setting the mood"". The director could have gone several directions, putting on a darker face for the film (ala Taxi Driver) or they could have played off the contrasts of the bright happiness of Florida versus a dark and cold-blooded murderer. Instead they did nothing, making this film look like a made-for-TV movie.Third, Charlize plays a convincing enough Aileen, but Ricci's character is downright annoying. It seems like the same mousy character she's played in a dozen movies prior to this.I wanted to like the movie, as the subject matter is right up my alley, but overall, I was let down.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
A monster performance,"""Where did that performance come from""- that was the first thing many people including myself was thinking at the end of 'Monster', as i visualised Charlize as the sexy Stella in The Italian Job.Being very skeptical at first- if i should watch this movie or not was quite obvious as it was not a blockbuster - but after seeing Oprah interview Charlize and Roger Ebert saying that this was the greatest performance in the history of the cinema- there's no way i was NOT watching Monster.I believe after seeing the movie i will have to agree with Roger Ebert. This in fact was the greatest and most powerful performances ever. People may have been disturbed by some of the scenes in the movie - but it was all the disturbances, violent scenes and foul language that made Aileen's character look outstanding.Not forgetting the make up- after the movie was done- i had to research about Aileen Wuornos- and for a moment it was difficult to distinguish Charlize from the real Aileen- it was that close.This would not be the best movie to watch on movie night but it is definitely worth watching altogether- i wish i could congratulate Charlize in person- as after that powerful performance she gave- she has definitely made her mark as a serious actress.",,Anonymous,Biography
Charlize steals the show,"After having seen an actual documentary on Aileen Wuornos (dir. Nick Broomfield), I had to see what all the fuss was about Monster. And, to be honest, I've never been a fan of Charlize Theron. I give her full credit--his was her role, she stole the show. Theron truly embodies Wuornos, she transcends most acting performances on the big screen.As for the rest of the film--it was most satisfying overall, excepting Christina Ricci's portrayal. Unfortunately (or fortunately) for her, she's just too pretty for the role. If you watch Broomfield's doc you'll see what I mean. In the manner of accuracy, she didn't seem to add much to the film.

"""One of the Best performances in the history of the cinema""","Based on the true story of Highway Prostitute/serial killer Aileen Wuornos and staring Charlize Theron, in the role that earned her an Oscar and the title of the best performance in the history of Cinema. Wuornos is one of life's damaged people. Disillusioned about life and the men who pick her up on the highways of Florida for sex, she's suicidal when she meets Selby Wall, (Christina Ricci), a young woman who's been sent to stay with her aunt in Miami in a vain attempt to cure her homosexuality. After a rocky start the two connect, it's a relationship that will have a profound impact on Wuornos' life. Although she tries to get a real job Wuornos is forced back on the road as a prostitute to get money. When one of the johns who picks her up becomes violent she kills him, and then it starts to become a habit. Charlize Theron gives a totally convincing performance which is transcendently great, genuine and entirely astonishing. Her transformation from super beautiful to super ugly is amazing. It is not just a matter of make-up but a totally psychological embodiment. She truly gets into the psyche of Wuornos (she defiantly deserved her Oscar!) Charlize's performance is one that will be talked about for many years to come and it's done with an incredible amount of understanding of Wuornos' sentiment. Also full credit to first time Writer/ Director, Patty Jenkins for intelligently and Non-sensationally directing this dark and beautiful film.

An exercise in the art of 'acting',"What Charlize Theron does in ""Monster"" is called acting. That she does it brilliantly is certainly to her credit; that she deserved her Oscar is probably without dispute; that she has never shown the slightest signs that she could 'act' this brilliantly in the past is also without dispute. I stress this point because Theron's acting is the visible product of what she is doing; you are aware of how well she is doing her job, not because her transformation into Arleen Wuornos is so all encompassing (which it is) but because you know Charlize Theron; you've seen what she is capable of doing in other films. It may even be great acting, (I think it certainly comes close), in the theatrical style. Watching her I thought of other 'great' performances by women (Bette Davis in several films; Vivien Leigh in ""Streetcar"") but the performance is not transcendental.She never crosses the line where the divide between performer and character becomes a blissful irrelevancy, where acting is raised to such a level that you cease to be aware of it (Finney in ""Saturday Night and Sunday Morning"", Jane Fonda in ""Klute"", Monica Vitti in ""L'Avventurra"") As for the film which encompasses this astonishingly empathetic piece of acting I have to say writer/director Patty Jenkins has done a remarkable job. She has made Wuornos not only sympathetic, (ok, Theron has played her part in this, too), but with compassion and not just the angry politics of feminism she has argued a case for a woman's right to kill; at first in self-defence (she is horribly raped) but later in symbolic vengeance for what Wuornos and women have suffered at the hands of men. However wrong-footed you think she's being, it's a persuasive argument.The film concentrates on the time Wuornos meets Selby, her dim little tease of a lesbian lover (played too blandly for my liking by Christina Ricci) and commits her first murder up to her capture. Her trial, 12 year incarceration and subsequent execution are dealt with in the final minutes (and have already been the subject of two remarkable documentaries by Nick Broomfield). On route to this there are several quite extraordinary scenes, mostly with Wuornos and her victims, but also between Wuornos and Selby and between Selby and the church-going woman with whose family she boarded with, in which Jenkins manifesto is subdued by the trivia and banality of the everyday. I don't think you need to know anything about Wuornos' history to be moved by the tragedy of a woman whose life would never amount to anything other than one blow after another. There is one other performance in the film that merits mention. As Wuornos' final victim, a good man whom she kills almost because she can hardly help herself, an almost unrecognizably middle-aged and portly Scott Wilson, with very little dialogue and only a few minutes of screen time, creates a wholly rounded, believable character in whom we can empathize and who is the antithesis of Wuornos herself (and most of the other men in the film). This is acting of a different kind from Theron's. This is the transcendental kind, where the line between acting and reality is blurred beyond recognition.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"BELIEVE the Hype, Walk..no RUN to see this movie","I'm baffled at some of the bad reviews for Charlize Theron's new movie Monster because Charlize Theron IS a revelation! Charlize is not playing Aileen, Charlize IS Aileen and I believed that from beginning to end. The guy who ran the Last Resort Biker bar, the hangout where Aileen frequented got the opportunity to work with Charlize and Patty Jenkins the first time(!) director of Monster. He knew Aileen and knew her mannerisms etc and he was astonished at Charlize's portrayal of Lee and I am too. Those who say Charlize was awakward in the role are missing the point especially about Lee and Selby. Their scene in the roller rink and outside of the roller rink is one of the greatest love scenes in my recent memory. The enthuiastic kissing is refreshing when compared to standard hollywood love scenes where people act like what is expected of them instead of how real people act when the excitement/arousal for each other hits them square between the eyes. When Lee and Selby eventually are intimate, their clinging to one another(clawing even) are extremely believable.Ms. Theron is so incredible in Monster, I dare say she might not be able to ever match it again. I feel that some might be expecting her too which would be unfair. I never knew she had this inside her, the talent to really lose herself in a role but she has proved that in spades with Monster. I only wish the movie had been longer and I was disappointed in the courtroom scenes..why on earth wasn't this focused on more? Despite this I highly recommend Monster to anyone who is even mildly curious, see it at a matinee if you must. I also recommend Nick Bloomfield's documentary about Aileen called ""Aileen:Life and Death of a Serial Killer"" which is playing in select cities including New York. The docu is a revisiting from over 10 years ago when Nick first made Lee the subject of a documentary called ""Selling of a Serial Killer"" which is available to buy on VHS.If you think you might not like the movie or might not be able to stomach, I still ask you see it for Charlize's potrayal alone. It is worth it despite what others think.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
""" One Life   which   started   at   the   bottom   and   worked  it's  way  down ""","Nature is ambivalent when dispensing life. Each beginning is allowed to experience its birth and thereafter what follows is not it's concern. Life among humans is so much the same. Everyone is given life. Some good, some bad and many others are a miserable collection of tragedies. This dramatic film is called "" Monster "" which explains little of the life of Aileen Wuornos, America's first recorded female serial killer. Charlize Theron convincingly plays Aileen, a young woman who endures a tragic beginning which eventually leads to a life of prostitution. According to her story, she becomes a victim of a sadistic customer or 'John' who brutalizes her, prompting her defense which results in murder. Finding a soul-mate in a girl-friend named Selby (Christina Ricci) the two then become a pair of fugitives, leaving a trail of murder victims across state lines. Bruce Dern is interesting as 'Thomas', a former Viet-Nam Vet and friend who adds a wonderful advisory element to an otherwise dark and somber film. Scott Wilson is another surprise addition who plays Horton, her last victim. One should recall it was Wilson who played Richard Hickock in the movie 'In cold blood' with Robert Blake. The black film dwells mostly on Aileen's lifetime complaint that she was never given a chance at the good life. Written and directed by Patty Jenkins, the film and its star receives much acclaim and due credit. A good offering to anyone who wants to skim the surface of a violent life which ended, much like it began. ****",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

A lazy rendition of a terrifying tale!,"Rather unfortunately for this movie, Nick Broomfield had already brought us the real Aileen Wuornos in his excellent 1992 documentary 'Aileen Wuornos: The Selling of a Serial Killer'. Compounding his excellence and Patty Jenkins' mediocrity, he also released his second documentary on her life (or, should I say, death), 'Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer', in 2003  the year 'Monster' finally reached our screens. With this competition, 'Monster' never really stood much of a chance. Even on this side of the Atlantic, where Aileen is not the celebrity death row inmate she is/was in America and the story should be fresher, it is told by Jenkins in such a hackneyed, clichéd way as to distract the viewer from the true tragedies of her life. It focuses on all the wrong things at all the wrong times, drawing attention with witless abandon away from the main downfall of Aileen's life  her own mind. She is trapped and terrified to such a degree within her own head that it is beyond the capabilities of such a mediocre film maker to comprehend her, let alone display any coherence on screen.Jenkins' opening sequence is, without mincing words, awful. Flashback and voice-over makes for lazy film-making at it's worst, and dispels any illusions or hope as to who is at the helm. To quote a much better screenwriter, Charlie Kaufman, and his interpretation of virtuoso Robert McKee's view on this 'if you use voice-over in your work. that's flaccid, sloppy writing. Any idiot can write a voice-over narration to explain the thoughts of a character'. Not that Patty Jenkins is all bad  she does give an almost valid woman's perspective on things, but goes overboard with this feeling and almost drowns in salivation at the thought of making Aileen Wuornos a feminist icon through her movie. She does not, and Aileen is not. Where Broomfield succeeded, and where Jenkins failed, is in the depiction of this woman as a pitiable victim. There is no need to go into logistics  what she did was terrible, and punishable  there is no denying that  but the awful incompetence of the United States Judicial System, along with it's Social Welfare net, allowed Aileen to become the woman she was. I won't dwell long on her story, as it's been told a hundred times (exploited by the people she trusted, for monetary gain), but merely wish to point out that Broomfield tells the story as it is, whereas Jenkins tells the story as she thinks it might be. She reduces Aileen's horrific childhood to a few short shots and a voice-over, and makes the rest of the tale into a bastardised 'Bonnie & Clyde' for the alternative lifestyle. Aileen, as we glean from Broomfield's annals, was in love with Selby, her lesbian partner, and Selby seemed to have, at the very least, high regard for Aileen. However, Jenkins' movie celebrates the lesbianism to a degree that this almost becomes a love story  leading the viewer to believe that it all would have turned out OK were it not for those gosh-darned johns laying dead under an overpass.The truth is, Aileen was manipulated by everyone who knew her, and Selby is not exempt. The implausibility of Christina Ricci, though vaguely attempting 'dyke'-stereotype tom-boyishness, falling in love with the heavy, uncouth and vaguely disgusting hi-way hooker that Charlize Theron (with greedy aplomb) embodies is the most visually arresting of the movies characterisation mistakes. Charlize gives a good performance, and is strikingly similar to Aileen throughout, but she is let down on all sides by B-movie flashes of acting (the usually great Ricci falling flat on her face at every step). She even attempts to bring across to the audience the real tragedy of the events of this woman's life  that all the deaths could have been prevented had Social Welfare stepped in at an early age. She also manages to instill in Aileen shades of the very thing that makes the woman so arresting in documentaries  her obvious mental handicaps. As Nick Broomfield says  'We have to ask ourselves why the American Government sees fit to execute a mentally deficient woman'. But this is a question Jenkins either dares not ask, for fear of box office repercussions, or it is something she does not have the maturity or capacity as a filmmaker to push.Theron is the only strong point in a mediocre movie with a badly written story; but even her acting skills cannot pull this film from the video-hell to which it will rightly be cast. The growth of character and narrative is stunted throughout by Jenkins' continuous attempts at independent film-making techniques  the 'road more traveled' that she seems to think she is the first to set out upon  and Theron isn't given a chance to shine in any real sense. Kudos to the make-up department, but we always knew Theron was much more than a pretty face, and she almost proves it here. Aileen Wuornos' life deserves much more than this, and though viewable for curiosity, Broomfield by far encapsulates the tale to a much greater effect  'Monster' cannot hope to come close to giving us a pure view. Aileen's story is a sad one, and a terrifying one for our own society and capitalist culture (not withstanding the alternative blinkered views of the American system, plus it's gung-ho, shoot-'em-all-up attitude to executions), and one that gives a stern caution. If we do not stand up for the weak in our society, then their fate becomes ours  a point severely lost in this pitiful attempt at serious film-making. 2/5",,Anonymous,Biography

Charlize Theron is an extraordinary actress.,"How could I not go see a film where Ebert's review mentions Theron's performance as one of the best(or maybe he said THE best-can't remember) female performances in cinema history? I went, saw it and must say that Ebert is right.Theron is extraordinary in this. It's NOT just the physical transformation but the overall perfermance in general. If she doesn't get the oscar this year, it would be very much a letdown. As far as the movie goes,the direction is incredible, it captures the time period to a tee, as does the music in the film. I had heard that Theron wrote a personal letter to Journey's Steve Perry requesting the use of ""Don't stop Believing"" in the skating scene. I'm glad it was used as it captures the essense of the scene and time period wonderfully.I'm not going to wax poetic on everything-first the negatives- this is a VERY VERY difficult film to sit through. It is not for the faint of heart. Certain scenes are so horrific you might have to look away from the screen and you will be shocked and unerved. HOWEVER- If you think you can deal with those things, see this. While I don't think this is the best movie ever made, I do think it is one of the most well acted, and also a fascinating, powerful character study. I would also like to mention as amazing as Theron is, not enough praise has Gone to Christina Ricci, who as Shelby is pretty darn good in her role and I would love her to receive a supporting actress nod, she certainly deserves it. The interaction between the two female leads is fascinating. All the acting is great, not just Theron and Ricci, Bruce dern as well as the various other people including the victims are acted on a leval of pure excellence.  Any major film buff who can appreciate amazing acting and direction will want to see this although as mentioned-it is NOT for the faint of heart. Although I think this movie is very very welldone it'd be hard to sit through it again, although seeing it once, I know now when to ""look away"". One other thing I will mention is this movie doesn't drag-not for one moment-which is in itself kind of rare-And lastly-I hope to see Charlize making the acceptance speech come oscar time.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Charlize Theron's Highway to Heaven,"Seeking shelter from the rain, wizening highway prostitute Charlize Theron (as Aileen Wuornos) ducks into a Lesbian bar, to dry out and suck up a beer. There, she meets doe-eyed innocent Christina Ricci (as Selby Wall), who helps usher Ms. Theron out of the closet. We learn Theron was raped at an early age, and has been treated like dirt by many men. An extremely selfish young woman, Ms. Ricci, expects Theron to satisfy her in bed, and support her with money made from prostitution. Theron is poor, misunderstood, and abused; she wants to go straight - but, sadly, a bad trick turns her into a serial killer""Monster"" was based on a true story. The monster is a Ferris wheel, as explained in the ""Life is funny, it's hard..."" narration, recited after a murder. Theron won a mother lode of ""Best Actress"" awards; and, other than sometimes seeming self-conscious about having something foreign in her mouth, she is good in the role. Incredibly, Theron and writer/director Patty Jenkins turn convicted murderer Aileen ""Lee"" Wuornos into a staggering, swaggering Lesbian fantasy figure. Theron's rendition of a familiar two word vulgarism (aka ""F.U."") to a secretary named ""Leslie"", may be one of funniest uses of that phrase in film.***** Monster (11/16/03) Patty Jenkins ~ Charlize Theron, Christina Ricci, Annie Corley, Bruce Dern",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wow amazing performance!,"I watched this movie expecting an overrated effort from Patty Jenkins and Charlize Theron. I was proven wrong. Charlize Theron gave one of the most astounding performances of the year, I knew that she had it in her to give good performances, but I never expected this from her. I think director Patty Jenkins has some good things going for her in the future. There were some troubles with the script, and I think Ms. Jenkins went a little to easy on Aileen. But, this film is a unique experience and a unique piece of work. Charlize Theron's performance is one to be remembered. And, it is a shame so many only look at her ability to grunge down for her role. Well People! She has to do that! SHE IS AN ACTRESS! She wasn't trying to win an Oscar(for all I know) she was doing her job, trying to make us believe she is Aileen. She gives an amazing performance you have to see, even the skeptics!

enlightenment,"I would have to say at first I crinkled my nose at the DVD box that my wife brought home. Heh. I had heard of the movie but unfortunately missed the end of the Oscars. I tossed the box to the side until we had time to watch it. So I didn't know Aileen's story or the ending.I have watched it several times since. I have been enlightened to the cruelty of society, myself and others included. One chance, one person who looked beyond themselves could have made this a story of a person who fell in love, pulled themselves from the depths of despair only to find the touch, the love, the tenderness that had been lacking for so long.I've read the reviews all over the Net. Film critics seemed divided on one web site. Making fun of Charlize Theron, calling Aileen despicable, faulting the film for not fitting cookie cutter models. I feel that some people, maybe most, just don't get it. Of course she murdered, and that cannot be forgiven and she paid the price society dealt. Which brings me back to society. It most certainly didn't help.We all need to open our eyes and try a little harder in our hectic, busy, ""I don't have time"" lives to every once in a while provide support to those that may need our help. Sometimes, like Aileen, they even ask for help. I'm not perfect, I work downtown and see plenty of people that need and ask for help. I can recognize that some are schemers. I intend to help those I can from now on, and not only by giving them some change, but by offering some words of encouragement. Yes maybe its too small to help much. But what if we all had this attitude, and helped even a little.Some may still fall through the system, but as a society, can we not evolve to saving and helping all? Aileen was on the edge and because of her mental health problem, fell over the edge. The victims are many and I feel for the seven men and if I may say so, pray for all of us so that this may never happen again.Gee if you read this comment, thank you. I guess I'd have to say that this film Monster has forever changed me and I am still dealing with the meanings of this film.Thank you for your time.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Worth seeing for Theron alone.,"I'm sorry, but I neglect to see what's so great about this movie.Acting: we all know how great Charlize Theron is in her Oscar-Winning role, so I need not add further comment in risk of sounding redundant. But her character Aileen is so flawed, we don't see her as a three-dimensional serial killer, which would've been the logical thing to do, but instead all we see is a foul-mouthed bi-polar piece of trash...who killed people. Christina Ricci as Selby was also extremely difficult to relate to, let alone sympathize with. She was just an annoying brat who went with Aileen for no apparent reason.Writing: The writing is TERRIBLE! The script is mind-numbingly bad, wallowing in a pool of mediocrity. I've seen eight year olds who have written better (Literally). The screenplay makes Plan 9 From Outer Space look like Network in comparison. Characters act and react with no apparent reasoning, and it is utterly incapable in holding a narrative story, instead we have a cut and pasted collage of scenes that are just excuses for Aileen and Selby to scream and vomit foul language at each other. The story could've been a ""Buring Bed"" type of feminist liberation story, which would've been sensible, but instead chooses to focus on the relationship between Aileen and Selby, which sounds good now, but the final-product of just focusing on their relationship makes the film extraordinarily drawn-out.Direction: In attempts to create a suitably bleak atmosphere, director Patty Jenkins shoots in very simplistic ways, instead of having a lot of fancy camera movement, etc. However, the end product doesn't look artistically bleak like intended, just boring. Albeit, yes, I will admit that the rape scene was played appropriately, well, disturbing and gruesome, but it doesn't compensate for the rest of the movie, which is bland, and doesn't hold our interest in any way.Final Comment: Save yourself from wasting money on this film, and instead jam forks in your eye-sockets, which doesn't sound so bad after seeing this film.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Reality?,"I loved Monster and thought Charlize Theron's performance was the best I'd seen in a film this year. But I wanted to comment on something. Much has been made of Theron's makeover from gorgeous glamour girl to wasted alkie white trash prostitute. True, she and the filmmakers did take a bold chance in transforming her. But they sacrificed a lot of ""realism"" in the casting of sexy Christina Ricci as the young lesbian love interest. I've seen photos of the real ""Selby"" and she resembles the gigantic, one-toothed, pinhearded character Sloth from The Goonies much more than she does the delectable Ricci. Of course seeing a dressed-down Theron and a big ugly goon making out would not be as a big box office draw as Theron and Ricci as lovers.But it would have made for a much more ""real"" film.",,Anonymous,Biography

Excellent.,"I believe that this movie did an excellent job of remaking Aileen Wuornos. I believe that they could have featured more about the trial and ""Selby Wall""(whose real name is Tyria Moore. Obviously the name was changed for this movie.) About how she said that she had never known that Aileen killed anyone, and how she complied with the police to convict Aileen and to save herself. Other than the fact that the movie did not show Selby(Tyria) for the heartless snake that she was, this movie did excellent. They turned the beautiful Charlize Theoron to look almost exactly as the true Aileen Wuornos did. That was an accomplishment that not many movies will actually take part in, and I was thrilled to see that this movie had. I also liked the fact that it showed Aileen gradually losing her mind. How she killed a man who had begged her not to, how she had pushed Selby and thrown stuff, and how she killed so many men that did nothing to her. That shows the flaws in the court system which will put to death an apparently crazy young woman. Two Thumbs Up.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

As the killer, Theron is an unsettling screen presence.  At times, you almost feel sorry for Aileen Wuornos for becoming the horrible thing she turned out to be.

Missed opportunity ignores most of the story,"I don't have the same negative opinion of the way the theme of love between the two women was handled as some others I know, but this was a difficult movie to watch. I had to skip a many scenes and fast-forward through more, unable to stomach all the aimless underclass squalor. Bleagh!Charlize Theron was wa-a-ay too one-dimensional, having learned a single defiant stance and holding it through the entire film. This made her characterization stultifying and boring. If you've seen interviews with the real Aileen Wournos, she could be quiet and earnest, but always psychotically intense. Given to outbursts of rage, of course, she displayed a dynamic range lacking in this portrayal. Theron is always weaving back and forth or bobbing up and down. Wournos could sit quietly with Manson lamps and scare the drizzle out of you.Ricci was fabulous in her wonderful performance as Wournos's lover and companion. She played it with just the right balance of understanding, possessive mania and codependency, and appropriately reacted to the well-presented backstory of her parental abuse. Unfortunately, the director chose to focus more on Wournos's crimes than the affair, which puts Monster in the class of average films, not ground breakers. Had the unspeakable violence Wournos gave and got served as the stratum upon which the remarkable lesbian love affair was precariously balanced, the movie would have been truly remarkable. And this may have rescued Theron from her one-dimensional characterization as well.The deterioration of that affair after the capture of Wournos was not portrayed. The movie effectively ends with her capture. We don't see the betrayal by Ricci or Theron's loyal forgiveness. We see nothing of the court battle and media coverage. Nor do we explore the rare female serial killer mentality. By focusing so heavily on crime and milieu, Monster misses much of the guts of the Wournos story. Compare this film to In Cold Blood or The Boston Strangler, where the police investigation and court trial play a role. Here, they are ignored.One last thing about Theron. Why the weight gain? There were only a couple of brief scenes where she was nearly nekky, and she certainly could have just used Hollywood technology for those. It wasn't worth the build-up just to see her with cellulite. It did nothing for Stallone in the forgettable Cop Land, and does nothing for Theron here. The real Ricci character was an overweight woman with missing teeth. Why didn't they go for realism with her as well? For one thing, nobody would be interested in watching two frumpy people in a murderous love story. But why keep Ricci attractive, and make Wournos look so god-awful?",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Good Approach That Just Doesn't Go Far Enough,"5 out of 10True story of Aileen Wournos.  A prostitute who killed over seven men in and around the Florida area during the 1980's.The most interesting aspect of this film is the fact that it merges the morality.  Nothing is black and white and the Wournas character is portrayed in a sensitive light.  In a lot of ways you really grow to have a compassion for her and a feeling for a her rough existence.  In fact during the first incident where she kills a man you are actually rooting for her to do it as he has tied her up and torturing her.  Wournas is really a victim and is no way the 'monster' that the title infers.  This is one of those 'stories behind the headlines'  that allows you to see it from a different perspective and have a better understanding about what happened and why.This also allows for a good commentary on society where the film seems to place the brunt of the blame.  We see her trying to go clean and yet when no one will hire her she is forced to go back to her old ways and then punished for simply doing the desperate acts of a desperate person with few if any options.  The real monster here seems to be our socio-economic structure and certain puritanical people who underneath are really quite ugly and just as scary.The atmosphere is gritty and authentic and never let's up.  There is also a nice running commentary by the Wournas character, which allows for further insight into how she rationalizes what she does.  Some of her observations are right on target.The film's biggest flaw is that it  puts too much emphasis on her relationship with lesbian lover Selby (Ricci).  It's a rather offbeat relationship for sure and there are some telling moments about it, but it's only one element.  Some of the scenes between the two go on too long and become boring.The film also completely skip Wournas's childhood, which seems like an almost fundamental stage to examine.  The scenes involving the killings of the male customers are pretty benign.  Only the one involving Wilson, who was simply a kindly old man at the wrong place at the wrong time, has any emotional impact.Theron certainly plays the part without fault and was an obvious choice for the Oscar yet some of the credit really needs to go to the make up department.  Ricci is usually pretty good, but some of her responses here seem affected.  Still she has a real nice innocent girl look here that ends up exposing a dark side you just don't see at the start.Overall the film doesn't seem too have as much impact as it  should. The approach is a little too biased and they seem almost intent at making Wournas into some sort of martyr.  Despite an earnest effort it still seems like just an overview.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Not entirely flawless, but devastating nonetheless (***1/2)","You may have read a lot about Charlize Theron's astounding performance in ""Monster"" and her amazing transformation from being gorgeous and elegant to being haggard and rough-edged. Those reports have not been exaggerated. If she doesn't at least get an Oscar nomination for her role here (and say, Nicole Kidman does for ""Cold Mountain""), I might not even watch the ceremony.She plays Aileen Wuornos, the highway prostitute who murdered six clients back in 1988 and was executed last year. Not giving a whole lot in the way of background, the film concentrates only on a short amount of time in Wuornos' life, shortly before the murders, during, and shortly after.Though she was not herself a lesbian, she began a relationship just before the murders with a naive, co-dependent lesbian named Selby (Christina Ricci), simply because she was so achingly lonely that she was willing to be with anyone who liked her.Her first murder was in self-defense, and if it was anything like it's shown here (a extremely brutal beating and rape), it was well justified.After that, she tries for a short while to go straight and get a real job, but fails miserably and goes back to hooking, killing some clients for money.Writer/director Patty Jenkins doesn't shy away from showing all of Wuornos' killings for what they were after that first one: brutal and unnecessary (not self-defense, as the real Wuornos claimed ALL her killing were). But she also takes great strides to humanize the character, giving her genuine feelings and a desperate romance (including a truly romantic roller skating scene set to Journey's ""Don't Stop Believin'"") that arouses feeling of sympathy in us, which is surprising and gives her character (who really is a monster, there's no doubt about that) truly tragic shadings. We despise her for her actions, but feel sad for her about the hand she's been dealt in life.""Monster"" may not be the feel-good hit of the year, but it's a harsh and powerful film that elicits strong emotional reactions and has one of the best performances to hit screens in years.

The Hitchhikers' Guide to Hooking,"Not much that hasn't already been said about Monster - Charlize Theron bagged a (deserved) Oscar for her performance as lesbian serial killer and hooker-hitchhiker 'Aileen' and Christina Ricci played her part too (she was great, but there was only ever going to be one winner out of the two).As reported in the press at the time, Theron gained plenty of weight to make herself look almost indistinguishable from her normal (Aeon Flux catsuit-wearing) self, but it wasn't just the weightgain that scooped her the prize. She plays a killer - traditionally someone audiences would find it hard to root for. And, rightly so, the majority of people knew that she was in the wrong. However, Theron plays the part to show why she became the way she was. She wasn't born bad, but she had a hell of a nasty upbringing. At first, some (Charles Bronson fans) might even say her killings were justified, putting her in the 'anti-hero' category. However, like similar anti-hero Carter (Michael Caine in Get Carter) she pushed her luck and crossed the line from doing bad to bad people to doing bad regardless. Therefore Aileen must face the consequences for her actions.If you haven't already seen it, you really should. If you need any more recommendations, check out the DVD to buy on Amazon. It's one of those rare films that (as of the time of this review) hasn't received a single 'One Star' rating.Just watch out the next time you see a hitchhiker (unless it's Charlize Theron looking like her normal self - most guys wouldn't drive by then).http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A bit disappointing,actually","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsThe true life story of serial killer Aileen Wournos (Charlize Theron),a butt-ugly highway prostitute who was executed in 2002 after 12 years on death row for the murder of some of her clients after one tried to rape her (must have been desperate!)There's a sub-plot involving her lesbian relationship with a painfully shy girl with a religious upbringing named Selby (Christina Ricci).(These two would be better suited as lesbians as not many men would find them attractive.)This was a film that I was looking forward to seeing with a huge amount of anticipation.The plot line,based on a true story,sounded very interesting,and everyone had raved about how good the performances were,in particular,Charlize Theron in the lead.And that is perhaps why I considered Monster to be such a let down as a film,as I always do when my expectations are very high.The film basically just failed to involve me in any way,performances or story wise.On the performances front,there were occasional flourishes here-and-there,but generally speaking it was all very under-whelming.And as for the story,there is a disappointing shortage of emotional depth invested in it.We just basically see Aileen in the state she was in in adulthood,and don't learn enough about the abuse and abandonment she endured through her life up until that point.There is a fairly effective snippet somewhere at the beginning,but it's just not enough to engage in the film the whole way through.Okay,maybe it was actually a brilliant film,but it was recorded in such a low volume audio sound that I could only hear the lead stars mumbling out everything and I was unable to hear large chunks of dialogue that the actors were speaking,and so I was unable to take it all in.The only segment in which the film breaks free from this curse is in the soundtrack,which is very impressive and certainly very alive,loud and vibrant.The film is certainly a lot more low-budget and independent looking than I imagined,especially for one that went on to win an Oscar or two,not to mention shorter.A short,effective and to-the-point film is nothing for me to put down,but here it just feels as though the makers tried to cram too much in to such a small space of time and didn't give their project enough time to flourish and grow.As I said,it's commendable in the soundtrack department and occasional high points throughout the film.And the make-up stylist did a very impressive job turning the stunningly attractive Theron into someone as unsightly as Aileen.But,considering what could have been,when that's the best there is,it really isn't saying much.A let down.**",,Anonymous,Biography

"Superb, gripping performance by Charlize Theron keeps this story well afloat","""Monster"" is a great film almost entirely carried by its lead actress, Charlize Theron, who delivers one of the most superb, convincing, honest performances in the history of cinema. I have seen Theron in other films, and acknowledge that in reality, she is even a rare beauty. Yet seeing this film, I did not imagine for one second that she was anything else but this fascinating, unique character. Theron manages to captivate us with this seemingly contemptible, hideous ""monster"" (as the title suggests) and take us into Wuornos' world of frustration, confusion, delirium, and desparation. We learn that Aileen Wuornos was not born an infamous, heartless serial killer, but that she once had other aspirations in life, sabotaged by a very unfortunate series of events, particularly in her childhood. Through Theron's compelling deliverance, we discover the painful misery, as well as shades of happiness and hope, in this tortured woman, so afflicted from life and never really given a chance to succeed as anything else than a ""nobody"" prostitute on the brink of collapse. Wuornos, without seeking, befriends Selby, with whom she will develop a relationship which will be the culmination and happiness of her life. We realize that Wuornos' horrible crimes can never be reasoned or excused, for they are truly monstrous. This film, however, essentially through the understanding conviction of Charlize Theron, provides us with perhaps an explanation of how Aileen Wuornos came to despise the world and commit a series of perfunctory and brutal murders which would ultimately be her demise. Or perhaps the demise of Wuornos was life itself, which never gave Wuornos a rightful place in the world. Compelling and devastating film. **** out of ****",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

This movie is about a  psychopathic female serial killer.,"This movie is about a cold-blooded psychopathic female serial killer,Aileen Wuornos who just kill the men without any reason except the first one. Patty Jenkins(the director and writer of this movie) really tried hard to make viewers of this movie to sympathize with Aileen Wuornos. This kind of approach is dangerous because Aileen did not have to kill those men to get the money and nothing can justify her brutal crimes.

Greatest Performance Ever? Absolutely!,"Charlize Theron's performance as serial killer Aileen Wuornos is the greatest acting job in the history of film. Even though every aspect of Monster is deeply moving, powerful, and touching, Charlize Theron is the most important piece of the film to discuss. She brilliantly plays the damaged and lost Aileen who strikes back at a society who never gave her a chance to live happily and successfully. Roger Ebert said in his review on the Ebert and Roeper television show that Charlize embodies Aileen Wuornos, but I will add that her performance is so outstanding and remarkable it's as if the film makers brought Wuornos from the dead and had her play herself. Charlize is not in the film being an actress named Charlize Theron, but she has literally become Aileen Wuornos. Theron is great because she knew and understood this tragic woman completely. It will be difficult to watch other films without comparing the performances of others to Charlize Theron's in Monster because she has accomplished what nobody else has in acting; both in movie history and current film. Acting students will be studying this performance for many years and they will learn much from it.Monster is disturbing and upsetting, but Charlize Theron's part as Aileen Wuornos must be seen. She's truly fantastic.",,Anonymous,Biography

Saddening yet Exhilarating Biopic,"Aileen Wuornos was often regarded as one of the most mentally unhinged American serial killers in the final quarter of the 20th century, and her ultimate conviction from murder during street prostitution has led to ongoing debate on whether she truly deserved her outcome or not. The 2003 biographical feature depicting said period in her life known as Monster continues to ask those questions, especially as its status has been highly acclaimed from critics and audiences and even won lead actor Charliez Theron her sole Oscar. But how well does the movie age today compared to 20 years ago?The film follows the aforementioned Wuornos struggling through the dangerous world of highway prostitution while trying to obtain a normal life through a naive gay woman named Selby Wall. As this feature depicts the spiraling downfall of Wurnous's life that inevitably led to her being sent to death row, it also knows to display some form of human connection within Aileen's broken lifestyle, which is anything but difficult. Thanks in large part to Charlize Theron's brutally harsh performance and the brilliant makeup work, it is next to impossible to grasp just what Wurnous was feeling and thinking in both her fluctuating body language and vulnerable outbursts. While Wurnous's actions were truly reprehensible, Theron and director Patty Jenkins empathize with the subject more than enough to present her as troubled and complicated based on where she ended up rather than demoralize her from the get go. It's hard to transform into a real life person and make them convincing, but Theron found a way to make us feel for Aileen in more ways than one, and that is no small feat.As for those in Wuornos's life, while Christina Ricci might not have been the ideal choice for Selby Wall, she still captures the emotionally tumultuous side someone brought into the life of someone who trusted an otherwise dangerous criminal. Considering Selby is a fictionalized portrayal of Wurnous's real-life girlfriend Tyria Moore, Ricci's intentionally clueless demeanor as the character allows us to see the devastation brought on from someone who wanted to see the world beyond their boring Christian lifestyle without understanding the repercussions of doing so. Many other characters either show a little bit of humanity towards Aileen like her only real friend Thomas or one notable law enforcer, or just view her as a piece of meat like the men she did in or those who rightfully show concern for Selby's well being such as her family. With the exception of the truly repugnant men Aileen witnessed, almost nobody in the film is truly seen as either a good guy or bad guy, and that could not have been portrayed better in any other fashion besides a documentary than this earnest biopic.In regards to other notable qualities, the actual filmmaking is pretty good if not completely remarkable, but that is to be expected of lower budgeted indie films from this time period. While the Florida setting is mainly used as a backdrop for Aileen's misadventures, the themes of christian misdoings are displayed through the mundane and the unordinary, mainly through the typical yet shady towns Aileen and Selby roam through and the seemingly wholesome environments that are anything but pleasant, down to an amusement park coming off as a character motif for Aileen's little semblance of humanity left. Some scenes might end a bit too abruptly to get to the main purpose of the feature, but the film knows not to waste any time in allowing the more raw moments to sink in. Lastly, the soundtrack is a lot of fun to listen to in its own right, and the inclusion of Journey's hit song Don't Stop Believin' works well as symbolism of Aileen's own struggles as a thoroughly lonely victim that is partially their own worst enemy. Sometimes smaller production qualities can make a film work better than lavish ones.Regardless of anyone's personal views towards Aileen Wurnous, Patty Jenkins' Monster remains a remarkably saddening tale of self destruction and dangerous consequences from one's own actions caused by themselves and those that damaged them. Unless you rightfully cannot handle the subject matter, this film is worth your time by means of understanding a slightly different point of view of a convicted murderer that the media often refuses to acknowledge. In a day and age where we are empathizing on what led to serial killers committing their crimes more and more, this feature holds up like fine wine.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Monstruous Performing!,"A real story of a prostitute (Charlize Theron) who suffered sexual abuses when she was a child, and decides to start killing every one of her clients. Also she falls in love with a girl (Christina Ricci) that meets in some gay bar.Predictable and linear to death, the structure of Monster is more suitable for a TV Movie; the script is second-rate, and they hasn't racked their brains writing down those dialogues. It seems like Patty Jenkins' idea of a lesbian is something like a trucker driver or so... Anyway, the script, the dialogues, the stereotypes, the worst sex scene ever, the boredom of it all, are not the worst things about ""Monster"". The worst thing of this movie is that one for which they gave it an Oscar: Charlize Theron. Let's see: Theron seems to believe that if you fatten yourself, put on colour contact lens, shave your eyebrows, get some false teeth, and walk around just like if you were John Wayne itself, you have it made (and so they think there in The Academy) ... No ma'am! It does not work that way. You gotta have talent. All that I've watched in Monster it's Charlize Theron in disguise. She's just not credible at all, at any sequence. I don't see an evil-psycho-hooker, I see some histrionic-overacting fat girl moving just like a bullfighter. Anyone can dress up, get a whig, and so ... But only the best actors can bring those kind of characters to life. Actors just like De Niro, Karloff, Hofman, or even Nicole Kidman. As I've said before, Monster itself is nothing to write home about, but even it if were, Charlize Theron's performance would have ruined it all.As for Christina Ricci, he does a good job as usual.My Rate: 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
killer or heroine ?,"This movie showed what was going on in serial killer´ s had, in her mind, and ,if I could say, in her body during those murders.

I liked ´Monster´ because it showed real psihological drama in the main character and her companion. During the film we are lead to belive that it is justified what she did, we  fell for this woman who just killed six guys and in our hart  we find a place to forgive her crimes. At the and  there was people, inluding myself, who almost cryed because of her conviction. Charlize did a great job there and we all love her for gaining and losing 13 kilos (more or less,  I wouldn´t know ).

A Depressing Story of Aileen Wuornos!,"I don't know why Aileen Wuornos, American female serial killer, gets more attention than others like Sante Kimes and Karla Homolka. She has a terrible childhood which included abuse of all kinds including sexual, physical, and psychological. Aileen is a tragic figure of society while Charlize Theron plays her quite brilliantly as a sad, tragic figure also a murderer. Most serial killers like Gacy and Bundy are remorseless and refuse to admit any wrong doing but not Aileen who finally confesses to murdering her johns but the motives are vague and unclear. She was probably threatened psychologically from childhood trauma. Unlike most serial killers, she was a detached killer who shot and robbed her victims who were mostly men. The film shows the men in a sympathetic light which is right in this case. The victims deserve sympathy while I feel sympathy for Aileen who I had trouble watching this film because she is so tragic and humanized by Theron's performance. In the end, she faces her fate while most killers sentenced to death fight all the way. Aileen stops the appeals because she wants to face her penalty. Even her relationship with SHelby whose named was changed shows that Aileen did have a conscience and the ability to love that few serial killers or sociopaths are capable of to do at all.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

A confused and depressing mess,"Leaving aside for the moment Charlize Theron's amazing transformation, the experience of watching this film was unpleasant in the extreme. This was another case of a female director attempting to make a heroine out of a completely worthless individual.  Creating a feminist heroine out of a vicious murderer is no mean feat and Patty Jenkins fails miserably. comparing this film to say, Bonnie and Clyde, is worthwhile. We get to see Clyde and Bonnie as the people they are, warts and all, and yet somehow get swept up in the story. The supporting roles are all ably handled and given enough flesh to make sense. Monster does nothing of the kind. The supporting roles are mere devices to move the story. The victims' personalities are paper thin. I have to search hard in memory to find a more unsatisfactory film experience. Given that I must say that Charlize Theron does an amazing job within the limitations of a hackneyed script and confused storyline.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography

A real great movie!,"Without a doubt, this is one of the best movies that I have seen in a long time. Charlize Theron gives one of the most compelling and emotional performances in movie history. I would compare it to Maggie Smith's powerful performance in ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"" (1969) for complete acting by a leading lady. I had to talk my wife into seeing this movie. After viewing it, she has found it difficult to believe that the charactor on the screen is in real live such a beautiful woman. Charlize makes Aileen Wuornos look and feel so real that she forces you, the audience, to understand what drove this woman to kill 7 johns.Unfortunately, Bruce Dern once again plays a screwed-up Viet Nam War Veteran (""Coming Home""). To me, he was too recognizable as an actor, which made it hard for him to be beliveable in this role. They should have used an lesser-known actor to play that part.Christina Ricci, without ""Addams Family"" makeup was able to look like a fresh face and not a known actor. She gives a good, strong performance and should have received more recognition than she got.I would highly recommend this movie to anyone with a strong enough stomach to watch the horrible treatment she goes through, but then again every parent with a troubled daughter should see it and imagine what can happen to their daughter if they are lousy parents. Bottom line, that is what put the real Aileen into the depressing life she lived. She deserved better.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Powerful,"Monster can only be described as a powerful piece of cinema.It follows the life of one troubled woman, Aileen `Lee' Wuornos (played by Charlize Theron), the real life serial killer who made headlines in the 1980's. The movie shows you the last years of freedom she endured, following her relationship with Selby (Christina Ricci), a young lesbian who was in desperate need of a friend. The movie is told by the point of view of Aileen, which allows you to sympathize with the killer.The performance delivered by Charlize Theron was so believable, you forgot that behind this ugly sun-spotted face there is a beautiful, talented woman who had the guts to pull this role off. Theron proved what a good actress she was by transforming herself, mentally and physically into the role. Her performance was Oscar worthy, and if she does not win, then like Roger Ebert said ""the Academy needs to retire"".Christina Ricci tends to get pushed on the back burner because Theron's performance was so mesmerizing. However, Ricci cannot be forgotten. Her performance was also quite wonderful, and I have no doubt that she played the character exactly as written. Naive, and selfish can only describe the character of Selby. However, her love for Lee was real and that's all that mattered to both women.The movie begins with Lee telling a short summary of the fantasies that went through her head as a young child. She dreamed of being famous, rich, and successful. Like any other child. But instead, she became a prostitute at age 13, after her father committed suicide (which she explains later in the film). By now, we understand where her hardships started, and why she turned to the streets.Monster is a disturbing and depressing look into the life of an abused person. The character of Aileen represents non-sociopath killers around the world. It shows you how a human being, who does not kill for `pleasure' can spiral out of control and snap; destroying his or her life, and the lives of many others.The movie focuses more on the relationship of Lee and Selby, rather than the killings. The characters are portrayed as real people caught up in the drama of life; something we can all relate to. By the end of the movie, you may find yourself in tears after seeing Selby and Aileen's relationship waste away.Monster puts a personality to Aileen Wuornos and allows the viewers to step inside her world. It does not make excuses for her, nor does it view Wuornos as a victim who killed because she `had to' (with the exception of the first killing). Rather, it helps you understand her state of mind when the killings occurred, why she felt she had to, and why she went through with it.There have been many complaints that Monster is not `factual'. Well, my argument to that is `who cares'? It was still a well made, well acted, well written, intense drama with emotion filled to the brim. What more could a person ask for?This movie is one of my favorite movies of all time. If I could give it a rating higher than 10/10, I would.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the best performances of all time.,"Charlize Theron's performance in Monster is nothing short of captivating. In this haunting and powerful film, Theron undergoes an incredible physical and emotional transformation to portray real-life serial killer Aileen Wuornos. Her remarkable dedication and talent shine through, earning her numerous accolades and widespread acclaim.Theron's portrayal of Wuornos is nothing less than remarkable. She completely immerses herself in the role, adopting Wuornos' mannerisms, speech patterns, and physicality, to the point where it becomes easy to forget that it is Theron on the screen. She fearlessly embraces the complexity of the character, showcasing Wuornos' pain, anger, and vulnerability with remarkable authenticity.What makes Theron's performance in Monster truly exceptional is her ability to evoke both sympathy and discomfort from the audience. Despite Wuornos' horrific crimes, Theron humanizes her, shining a light on the circumstances and traumas that led her down such a dark path. It's a testament to Theron's skill that she is able to balance the character's brutality with moments of heartbreaking humanity, leaving viewers conflicted in their feelings towards Wuornos.Theron's chemistry with Christina Ricci, who plays Selby Wall, Wuornos' love interest, adds another layer of emotional depth to the film. Their relationship is complex and fraught with tragedy, and Theron's performance alongside Ricci's delicate vulnerability enhances the impact of their connection.Directed by Patty Jenkins, Monster is a gritty and intense character study that forces viewers to confront uncomfortable truths about society and the nature of human beings. Theron's transformative performance elevates an already powerful narrative, making it impossible to look away from the sheer force of her talent.In conclusion, Charlize Theron's portrayal in Monster is nothing short of mesmerizing. Her commitment to the role, combined with her remarkable talent, brings Aileen Wuornos to life in a way that is haunting and unforgettable. Theron's ability to evoke both sympathy and discomfort in the audience showcases her versatility as an actress. Monster stands as a testament to Theron's extraordinary transformation and cements her as one of the greatest actresses of her generation and my favorite actress of all time.Oscar 110% deserved.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A torture with no purpose,"I don't mind 'heavy' films or books. I mean works that take you to dark places of human soul, that lead you through suffering, pain or filth. That is alright as long as there is some ultimate purpose to all that excruciation, as long as their creators intend to lead their audience to something other than pain and filth. It does not necessarily presuppose a happy ending. Just 2 weeks ago I've seen ""House of sand and of fog"". There was no heroes riding into the sunset there either, but heavy and dark as it was, there was catharsis in there, some perspective of human soul, or whatever this undefinable thing that art gives us.There is nothing like that in ""Monster"". Oh, sure I can appreciate the art of makeup people and some mighty acting on Charlize Theron part, but I still do not see what this film has been supposed to convey. Most importantly in no way I can feel anything for Aileen Wuornos, however terrible her childhood and adult life were, however hard she were hit by society. And I understand that some may consider this view to be a snobbish perspective of a well-to-do suburb dweller who steers clear from what he terms as 'low-life'.

Fact-based drama features unforgettable performances from Theron and Ricci.,"Patty Jenkins' ""Monster"" is the real life story of recently executed prostitute and serial killer Aileen Wuornos, who murdered a series of men between 1989 and 1990.  The film focuses on that time period and Wuornos' budding lesbian relationship with Selby Wall, a quiet, shy young girl looking for companionship.  The film dosen't attempt to glamorize Wuornos' life, but it does paint a shocking portrait of why she killed her ""johns"", problems dating back to her childhood.  Until now, Charlize Theron has just been seen in decorative supporting parts (""That Thing You Do!"", ""The Cider House Rules"" and ""The Italian Job""), but this time, she IS the lead character, and she IS Aileen Wuornos.  Her Oscar-winning portrayal of the emotionally broken and suffering Wuornos is devastatingly real and brilliant.  Kudos to Christina Ricci, as well, for her quiet, fierce, award-caliber role as Selby.  Their scenes together are intensely effective, but ther are also scenes with Wuornos and her ""johns"" that are quite heartbreaking as well: the vignette when she is with an equally broken, stammering man named Gene (Pruitt Taylor Vince), and the shockingly realistic scene with Horton (Scott Wilson), a middle-aged passerby who unsuspectingly gives the young woman a ride, little expecting the danger in store.  From beginning to end, ""Monster"" is a powerful tour-de-force and a cinematic achievement.  ***1/2",,Anonymous,Biography

This is a performance for the ages, Theron totally embodies Aileen...appearance, clothes, gait...these are easy (yet not often done right)*, but to get into a personality is not.Theron's performance will be archived for study by all in the film industry. Few can go to such a dark place.  PERKINS knew of what she was directing; Theron knew where she was going.There will always be controversy about AILEEN's guilt reference her history of abuse. What is interesting about this story (if the movie is true) is that Aileen's killing spree only occurs when she has a sense of love in her life and someone to live for. She killed for money to support her only love. That's what the story is about as portrayed in the movie; the killer is humanized, a bad intersection of emotions, but a powerful story that is not melodramatic.*I saw two movies this year where the heroines had a difficult backstory that would have drained most people and yet these gals look gorgeous.

Realistically Depressing but Intriguing Performance by Charlize Theron,"Monster is directed and written by Patty Jenkins. It was released in 2004. Monster is based on a biography of a serial killer prostitute named Aileen Wuornos usually goes by ""Lee"", starring Charlize Theron. Lee has been a homeless hooker since the age of 13 and in her 30s she meets a girl named Selby, played by Christina Ricci, that she falls in love with. Afraid that she's going to lose Selby due to no money, Aileen starts killing for a living shortly after a physical assault by one of her clients. Aileen's only friend Tom, played by Bruce Dern, helps feed her and checks in with her from time to time. This movie displays the hardships of being homeless and being a sex worker.Charlize Theron really brought Aileen Wuornos character back to life. Her performance of displaying the unstable emotions of anger and sadness of Wuornos felt very real. The movie's storyline and execution were amazing. There were many different perspectives in the movie. The perspective from Wuornos was very sad and heartbreaking. It shows that being a homeless hooker has many challenges such as always scraping by for money and her safety being endangered. Another perspective was Selby and her home life situation. Even at the end of the movie, the director made it possible for the audience to sympathize with the killer. The actors and actresses really brought back what it was like back then as well as the different perspectives listed above.The makeup for the characters was also great. Charlize Theron looked just like the real Aileen Wuornos. Reading some about Aileen Wuornos, the movie is very accurate about the real-life events happening in the movie. The research for making this movie was done very well. Although Selby is not the real name of the girl in the movie, the director did ask the real people for permission to include their name or not which is very respectable.Overall, I highly recommend this movie. Charlize Theron was phenomenal in presenting Wuornos's challenges mentally and physically. The movie really sucked me in and absorbed me.

One might also merely appreciate the art of acting in much the same way that one might appreciate a painting, beautiful but one wouldn't call that entertaining. ""Monster"" is this kind of art as it displays flawless acting, directing, and editing. Its two hours always retains the viewer's interest. Most notable of all is the portrayal of Aileen Wuonos, the notorious serial-killer of Florida. This demanding role was performed by Charlize Theron, and was done to perfection. Not since Crissy Rock's performance in ""Ladybird Ladybird"" have I seen anyone portray so well a personality type that (thank goodness) is foreign to most of us.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hardboiled with a perverted feminist streak...,"Oh I love when a film champions dirtbags, giving you every reason why you should feel sorry, feel sad for them.To this films credit it was nuanced and had a couple different interesting levels to it. It was like a car wreck of a life that you couldn't help but stare at, even more so when you think that it was a true story and the plotting and dialog was mostly realistic.Christina Ricci does a serviceable job and Theron wins the Oscar but I had a really hard time finding anything else good about this film other than the acting. It was more of a rotten look at the underbelly of white trash America than anything else.I still have a hard time recommending this as entertainment or even as a message film.

"So ugly, So beautiful!!!","First of all I have to say that this is the best female performance in the history of cinema, I bet you have read this a lot, but if want to disagree or rethink it, just go see for yourself!! If I had not known this was a Charlize Theron film before watching it, I wouldn't have ever knew who Aileen was.This COMPLETE transformation is every actors Dream,how ugly she looks,how painful and damaged, just astonishing!!I wont tell you about the story, this you must see yourself, but all I can tell is that this is a very well written\directed movie, with some of the best performances ever, the music is so emotional, patty Jenkins is very aware of her work, she did it with all her heart and soul, so did Theron, this is a non- Hollywood film, no dumb ideas, repeated stories nor shallow performances, which is the best in that movie, if you sympathize with or hate Aileen, you will definitely agree that Charlize is the best actress alive, don't believe me?

POWERFUL AND DISTURBING WITH THERON'S FINEST PERFORMANCE,"Patty Jenkins' Powerfully disturbing and tragic motion picture which is based on the true story of America's first female serial killer Ailen Wuornos, astonishingly played by an unrecognizable Charlize Theron who won an Oscar and Golden Globe Award for Best Actress for her unforgettable portrayal, she was a Florida highway prostitute who killed the men she serviced. Wuornos was having a lesbian relationship at that time with a young woman named Selby, superbly played by Christina Ricci, she would murder the men in cold-blood by shooting them so she could rob them of everything they had so she could support her love Selby. Once caught and arrested by the police she claimed that the killings were in self-defense, and after a media circus trail she was convicted and eventually executed. This brutal film is a real showcase for the brilliant acting talent and skill of Theron who's performance is truly uncanny, she gained 30 pounds for the role and perfectly becomes Wuornos with her mannerisms, strutting walk, and in her speech, and with the aided of the extraordinary makeup by Toni G that shows Wuornos' rotten teeth, bad skin, and dry hair. Astute direction by Jenkins, with fine supporting performances by Bruce Dern, Lee Tergesen, Annie Corley, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Marco St. John, Marc Macauly, and the late Scott Wilson.

A remarkable movie,"Charlize Theron's portrayal of Aileen is magnificent throughout. I completely forgot it was her within seconds of watching this movie and it's very rare that such a well known actor has the ability to do that. Theron's representation of someone who shows immense mood swings on a daily basis had me in awe of her. This character could not have been easy to play but she pulled it off flawlessly.The film as a whole is so moving. This is the kind of movie that you wont easily forget. The casting for this movie is incredible, I have mentioned Theron but Christina Ricci also did her role a great deal of justice. There is so much emotion and depth in the characters, you will feel your heart racing for Aileen and Selby as well as for very minor characters. It will have you questioning many things about our society that you may never have considered before. An outstanding movie in every way.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Mediocre, but a decent acting job by Theron","'Monster', written and directed by Patty Jenkins is based on the true-life events surrounding the life of Aileen Wuornos, (Charlize Theron) deemed the United States' first serial killer. The film briefly shows her childhood and adolescence, but soon focuses on her adult life, when she became a small-time homeless prostitute. One night she makes her way into a gay bar for a beer and meets Selby, (Christina Ricci) a young, insecure lesbian who spends the night buying Aileen drinks, which begins an intense, dysfunctional and passionate relationship that ends in the murder of seven men and the death of Wuornos in the electric chair.Theron is really quite good in 'Monster'. In addition to her highly publicized transformation from a gorgeous woman to a fairly ugly one, her acting chops are quite significant. Ricci, who started as such a cute and precocious actress decades ago, is just okay in her role as the naïve and whiny Selby; her performance is nothing better or worse than anything she's done in the last fifteen years. Removing the performances, 'Monster' is just an okay film that leans dangerously toward provoking a feeling of sympathy for Wuornos, a character that really isn't very sympathetic. Therefore, because of this slight bias, I was instantly ambivalent to the film as a whole. Other than this, there isn't anything seriously wrong with the film; it's just 'okay.''Monster' certainly wasn't a waste of my time, but by the same token, it's not a film I would seek out again any time soon, nor would I recommend it with any real enthusiasm. 5/10Shelly",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

The most extraordinary performance by an actress I have seen,"An astonishing movie, made by two extraordinary performances, those of Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci.  Ms. Theron is so seamless that one actually feels one is watching Wourmos.The movie avoids the obvious pitfalls of either demonizing her, or painting her as hard done by, although one feels that she is precisely these things, a tragic but ultimately unsalvageable human being.All this pertinent information aside, words fail me.

Crimson and Clover.,"The tag line dictates: Based on a true story. The small print at the end of this movie states something similar to this: While the movie is inspired by real events in A. Wuornos life, many characters are composites or inventions and a number of incidents in this film are fictional. Other than A.Wuornos, any similarity to any person is not intended and purely coincidental.When going to the cinema, it's interesting seeing a film and not, at times, knowing anything about a movie, who is starring, its story line etc.We chose Monster. We chose right.As the ending credit's rolled up, we just sat there stunned. What an intense movie. Extremely well shot, I can't say this enough. With a great musical soundtrack that complements each scene as the character's come to a crossroads in their lives.Written and Directed by Patty Jenkins, who has done an excellent job at bringing the sordid life of Aileen Wuornos, the unhappy victim of life's underclass, to the Big Screen. This film is brought together by a great team that star's Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci.This self-pitying and self-destructive life of an uneducated working class woman who turns to prostitution as a form to earn money, who not only blames society for her position in life but is finally prepared to murder for the better life that she has always longed for. On the run with her very naive young lover, Selby Wall. Who is placing too many demands for the better life that unbeknown to her is a price too high. Finally, when the bubble bursts it is far too late to turn back, it is time to face their demons and ironically for the first time, for Wuornos be responsible for their actions and to grow up.How much of this movie is true and factual I don't know, but as a movie that brings the emotions of loneliness, love, passion, anger, hate, friendship and hope together then it has succeed in every way possible.Ms. Jenkins has done a great job in bringing the audience close to a woman who should be despised for her grudges and self-pity, we should not condone the killings and the poor victims and their families who are the only victims of this very sad individual. But as we all, as Human Beings, deserve life, love, happiness and respect, then there is a very tiny amount of empathy. Who has not suffered similar situations as Wuornos, not in these extremes, but life cannot be judged by false hopes that turn into grudges that you are willing to murder. She was wrong to murder but so very right about the real side of Human Nature, that also, ironically, she played a big part in herself.This movie is a fantastic piece of work, through the writing, direction and the back up of a good crew. It rightly deserves the recognition of the Oscar. Well done to one and all.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Powerful and Unsettling,"I haven't seen a more powerful film since Bully.   All powerful films I count as the best are anything by Larry Clark till I saw Monster.   I know the story as I saw the fantastic documentary by Nick Bloomfield about Aileen Wuormos on Death Row, but when seeing the film it looked or the more real and disturbing.    However we don't really know the truth do what actually happened.  All we know is what she said and that's it.   I am not saying what happened to her was right because it is anything and everything but that but we have to look at all the directions of this story to know what really is the truth.    Nick Bloomfield said she was `mad' when talking to the press in his documentary and I think he clearer to the truth than we are ever going to get.  Her childhood was never the best and obviously scared her for life and made her think that there was no way out even when trying to find one.   The scene where she has tried to get a job and told that there would only be factory work for her and causes a stir and a policeman picks her up and just uses her in the same way other men do and that is treating her like a whore.   So in that respect she never could trust anyone because they were all the same to her even in the eyes of the law.The film is just not about her killing spree but her friendship that she made with a young lesbian girl named Shelby.  Shelby played by Christina Ricci is a loner and lives in a very strict religious family that tries to cure her from being a homosexual.   This is how Shelby and Aileen meet in a bar where Shelby is sitting on her till she sees Aileen.   At first they are not the best of friends but the friendship blossoms  and before you know they are the best of friends but are still unaware of their sexuality towards each other.   The chemistry between them is electric and there is always scenes where you think this and that is going to happen.   The story flows nicely without any boring scenes happening and I believed that Naomi Watts was more deserving of the Oscar but after seeing Monster I do now believe that Charlize Theron was better off to get it.   De Niro set the standard for male actor's when getting into character for like he did in Raging Bull and Theron has done it for female leads as she really did look like a true monster in the film.   Not being bias or anything it's just when you look at her in The Devil's Advocate and The Italian Job you think `Hello' but in Monster it's more like `Right!!!'.  Well that's what I think but fair do's to Theron for pulling that off and an amazing performance to go with it which is why she deserves her praise.The shock factor of the film is higher than usual especially when she meets her first victim in which an object is used on her in the most horrific and terrifying scene I have seen for a long time and with Theron's excellent performance it pulls it off to make you feel really uneasy about this film. It's such a tragic story of somebody who could not be saved from her downfall but it's uplifting to see that she always believed in what she told the world and she was not afraid to admit to what she did but people didn't see it from her point of view.   Because there are truth's and lies about what really happened I would have preferred to have not seen any of her killing's.   I would have liked to have seen instead her in the situation with the men that she was with and then for the scene to finish for it to go back after it has all happened so you have to make your own mind up whether she was just a cold blooded killer or a damsel in distress and just defended her rights and did what she had to do.This is a great directorial debut from Patty Jenkins and if she approaches her films to come the way she with Monster then we have a lot to look forward to.   As for the movie it is a very powerful portrayal of Aileen Wuornos and the amazing story that made her being officially none as the first female serial killer but we are not Hannibal Lector here but a more real to life and truthful story of struggle and normality.",,Anonymous,Biography
...when messed up prostitute meets  messed up lesbian teenager,"This is a very glum and depressing movie. But it makes you realize even more that you don't have to judge anyone. We all have reasons, and most of us, very good reasons for acting the way we do. And more, there are circumstances in our lives that we can face or not, depending on the level of self trust at that time. Charlize's character - Aileen- had a rough childhood deprived of warm feelings, good words and right guidance. And that made her the way she was, lonely, bitter and with no reason to go on living. That is until she mets Ricci's character - Selby. I wonder if the situation would have ended differently if Selby assumed some of the responsibilities of the couple herself. But that couldn't have happened cause she was just a child that needed to have fun without any complications.

Charlize Theron was a monster!,"Hollywood certainly got it right by awarding Charlize Theron the Best Actress Oscar but they should have gone one better by giving Christina Ricci Best Supporting Actress. The youthful innocence of her character magnified the monstrosity of the serial-killer prostitute. But now it is confession time. Though it was released five years ago, I just watched MONSTER–moments ago–on Video on Demand and was spellbound.However, I had never seen Charlize Theron before and anxiously awaited the ending so I could google the ugly actress who portrayed a serial killer. I looked at photos of Ms. Theron and swore that the stunning beauty was the not the same actress from MONSTER. The best precedent for this character transformation was when Robert DeNiro gained fifty pounds to become a bloated Jake Lamotta in ""Raging Bull."" But at least he ended up looking like a fat debauched version of Robert DeNiro.Another great thing about MONSTER was the continuously effective V.O. Most movies use a voice over to introduce a movie and then, if you hear it again at all, it is merely an afterthought.

Who can say what makes one do these horrible deeds.  Genes or environment whatever.  I am sure there is a point where people snap in life.    I found some of the film interesting, but the rest of the story has a 70's misunderstood bad guy theme to it.  I find working at the post office with some very bitter people in it scary and unsettling; they have a mean streak or hatred for the world I found missing in this film.  The movie 'In cold blood' is a better portrayal for this topic.  Some of her victims were not the best quality people, but I sure hate to ever get in the way of this enraged, bitter woman.  I find bitter people create more carnage, where I prefer the situation defused.  Don't bother with this one.  5 out of 10",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Rather good,"Theron did a good job playing the role of a broken and confused soul desperately trying to find a reason to live in another, and Christina Ricci plays a rather subtle introverted lesbian kid trying to find acceptance in a puzzle-like world she perceives beyond her.

"Very good lead performances, music.","When the movie ""Monster"" came out last year, I was actually living in the Orlando/Daytona Beach area of Florida. As a result, even before the Oscar nomination for Charlize Theron, the film had received a fair amount of press, though it was hearing the nomination that made me go to the Universal Cineplex and see the film for myself. I had no prior knowledge of the backstory of the real Aileen Wornous (having only moved to Florida a few months prior)The performances by Theron and Ricci really made the movie a gripping, suspenseful, tragic, and dare I say enjoyable experience. Prior to this film, I did not have a lot of respect for Charlize Theron (remember ""Mighty Joe Young"" and ""Sweet November""?) But seeing her transform so much in appearance and personality really made me grow respect for her as an actress. I felt she had turned around a bit in ""The Cider House Rules"" and ""The Italian Job"", but this really put her in my favor.However, I felt a little indignant after hearing that Theron was (deservadly) nominated for best actress, Christina Ricci was snubbed. I think that her performance was a great naive, lonely counterpart to Theron's jaded rage. Like Theron, I think she took the part she was given and totally expanded it and made it her own.The few drawbacks I have to say for the film, are that it got a little grating to see tragedy after tragedy hit Aileen. That got a little depressing to watch. Also, that Selby on a dime switched from being unknowing partner to conspirator to turncoat made her a little unlikeable, but other then that, great direction and score! The music was some of the best I'd heard in a movie in a long time.8/10 from me! Bravo Charlize, Christina and Patty",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

I have never been a huge fan of Ms. Theron's (she was slightly amusing in Curse of the Jade Scorpion and Celebrity), but this isn't Theron per se. Instead, the actress becomes female serial killer Wuornos - an external and internal transformation that is arresting, haunting and beautiful in its art and craft. I can't remember a better performance that continually grabs the audience by the lapels and elicits both shock and sympathy all in the same moment.

I can easily it's one of my favorote if not my FAVORITE movie of all time, and my favrittoe performance too. I was blown away with the talent I never thought that Charlize Thereon had. Her portrayal pf Aileen Wuornos was AMAZING. I can easily say that she was such a bad-ass, she really truly was a bad-ass. But it didn't just stop there. This is one of the most emotional characters that the movies have ever given us.Now I know I've only been talking about the performance in the movie and not the movie itself, so now I'll talk to you about that. This story is so heartfelt and emotional as it is intense. I could easily relate to both the characters by Charlize Theron, and Christina Ricci. I felt I was there with them every minute, and I was always hoping that there love would work out. You'll love them both, even if you're against gays. They honestly truly remind me of Glinda and Elphaba from Wicked. As a matter of fact this movie kind've reminds me of Wicked. Charlize Theron plays the girl that nobody ever talks to, and Christina Ridding is a little more glassy than her, and very soon they develops a connection. Although in this movie, instead of just being friends, they fall in love which to me is way more beautiful.So yeah.

I place the blame solely on Patty Jenkins.Despite my not liking it, some of the elements in this flick (most glaringly the performances) are strong enough to over ride my intellectual disagreement. From the saddening emotional neediness of co-dependent relationships to the depths of love which transcends educational background, social status and yes, even the level of intelligence between the affected parties. There are hence many things going for Monsters. But I just cannot accept it as a great film for the reasons already stated.Of course, don't take my word for it.

Monster,"Although Charlize Theron won an Oscar for her performance here, deservedly so, the film bends over backwards to put a human face on Aileen Wuornos that she doesn't really deserve. True, for those at the very bottom of society, life does seem like a conspiracy to hold them down, something that is evident here, but Wuornos had her chances. There is no mention in ""Monster"" of her marriage to a much older and extremely wealthy man, a big chance that she threw away by brutalising him. Her love interest Selby (in reality Tyria Moore) was a butch lesbian and absolutely nothing like the delectable Christina Ricci. Having said that, she was undoubtedly the only good thing in the serial killer's life after they met, and did her best for her. Here, she is portrayed as a little girl lost sponging off Wuornos, and in awe of her prostitute image.The first victim - Richard Mallory - is shown brutalising and raping Wuornos after the ""trick"" turns sour; in reality, although Mallory was a sexual deviant, there is no evidence that in their encounter he was anything more than a man who paid for sex and ended up dead.The film ends effectively when Wuornos and her lover part company, although we see a glimpse of her first murder trial, but nothing after that. Not a bad soundtrack either, but although ""Don't Stop Believin'"" is a great song, it sounds lyrically dissonant here.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

The making of the music by BT in discussion with the writer/director Patty Jenkins shows you why this movie is so successful.Everyone is working to the vision of a subtly told horrid story of the victimization of helpless people. This process must have taken place with the two principle actors Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci as well, because they are brilliant! I am definite going to look up their early work.

This was the only part of the story that I could personally relate to (as in, it was the only part that had happened to me), but that's what made it so emotional. If all the stuff that had happened to her had happened to me, I couldn't say I'd be in any better place than she was.There's a lot of talk about how amazing Cherize's transformation was, but I haven't seen anyone comment on how much it added to film. She talks about how she always wanted to be beautiful and famous, and knowing that it's Cherize playing her only reminds us that if her circumstance's were different she could've been. It stops people from just dismissing her as an ugly woman who never found something else to fall back on. It causes us to think. Beauty is not only innate, it, like everything else, depends on circumstance.This is a beautifully made and acted movie. It is worth watching only for that.

"""They Gotta Tell You Something...""","I just want to start off by saying that it's a shame that people focus solely on Charlize Theron's performance in this movie. Not that it's a poor performance, no, quite the contrary. But she alone does not carry this film. Great acting, a touching story, wonderful cinematography, and superb direction (especially for a first movie!), make this one of the best movies of last year.Yes, it's hard to feel sympathy for Wuornos after the fourth or fifth john she kills, and about 3/4 through the movie the ""I did it all for you"" excuse seems a little half-assed. But writer/director Patty Jenkins isn't looking for sympathy for Aileen ""Lee' Wuornos. This is one of those movies that isn't one way or another. Like most great films, it just is.Theron's performance is good, definitely Oscar-caliber, whatever that means,but still WAY overhyped. She's still a young actress who isn't at her best yet, but she's definitely showing signs of great skill. Christina Ricci also does a fine job.I totally did not expect the romantic plot involved in Monster. I expected a pretty much straight-up biopic, but I got a somewhat tender homosexual romance that, very tragically, goes awry. It's a very sad movie. If you're looking for an upper, stick to Amelie or some feel-good title along those lines. This is very depressing.Also, don't take your kids to see this. The cursing is through the roof, but there's a very violent rape scene as well as some very violent killings. Most of it is deserving of an R, but the rape scene in particular borders on an X.Patty Jenkins is one of the two big new directors of last year, the other being Sofia Coppola. I hope to see more movies from them in the upcoming years.MonsterFinal Cut: A-Direction: A- Script: B Style: B+ Acting: B+ Music: C+Fun Fact: Bruce Dern plays a Vietnam war veteran, which is, ironically, similar to the role he played in the totally sappy war movie ""Coming Home.""",,Anonymous,Biography

I was absolutely mesmerized from start to finish by this movie (although I could do without the initial voice-overs).  The only bad thing about this film is that Christina Ricci gives one of her best turns in a supporting role that is largely unsympathetic and will undeservedly be overlooked by everyone that's awestruck and train-wrecked by Theron's Aileen Wuornos.The fearlessness of this film is unprecedented and long-awaited.

"Great movie, great acting.","The story of Aileen Wournes is an horrific one. Brutilised and abused from the time she was born she never really had a chance -  Beaten by her father by reporting sexual abuse at the hands of a family friend. A prostitute from age 13. This doese not excuse the murders she committed (Except,possibly, the first one which was clearly self defense). What is does do is inspire compassion for her and the disasters of life choices she made, or were really made for by a sexist and classist society. The film is a also very clear about the enormous problems of American society. The lack of a genuine social welfare system helped to create her and the situation whereby she felt sex work and robbery were her only choices. A brilliant movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Lifetime movie with extra grit,"Charlize Theron's fine, albeit slightly overrated, performance, centers the movie.  Unfortunately, there's not much surrounding it.  Condensing anyone's life story into a two hour package inevitably involves simplifying details. However, in Monster, the movie didn't just simplify the story -- it eliminated any complexity whatsoever.  While the movie (smartly) doesn't deify Aileen Wuornos, it doesn't provide much insight other than sketching out a brief history of her troubled background and that she wanted to be loved.  Yet the movie seems to fear too many rough edges -- reading reviews of this movie that give it credit for its portrayal of a seedy Florida milieu, I'm struck by the fact that most of these reviewers wouldn't have the slightest clue what that really would have been like.  And that was one area where the movie was most unconvincing.  For all the talk about Theron's make up job, what about Christina Ricci's?  Considering they were broke most of the film, she must have stocked up on the Cover Girl before running away from home.This isn't just a matter of picking details.  Detachment takes the place of authenticity, which only serves to magnify the lack of context that this movie has.  It's not quite comfortable coming from the point of view of the mad Wuornos.  And Selby is pretty much a blank.  As the movie crawled to its inevitable inevitability, I was left wondering what was point the filmmakers were trying to get across other than it really sucked to be Aileen Wuornos.The best sequence in the movie is when Wuornos goes out to get a real job. Theron does a great job of conveying both the inflated optimism Wuornos develops in the throes of love, and the quick turnaround when the real world treats the way it always had before.  This is the one part of the movie that actually said something.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
about Aileen,"I am completely disgusted and appalled by what's been said here about Aileen. Sure, she did horrible choices and mistakes in her life but she was very much a victim herself. How can anyone be so daft to claim otherwise?I can totally understand how someone with her history ends up disgusted by men and becomes a murderer. Can't people understand that even murderers are humans? I just do not believe that people are born killers, born bad, born without a conscience. Not everyone of us are strong enough to be able to function by the society's rules. It is hypocrisy to put all the blame on people like Wuornos and not look at the circumstances and the faults in the society. That's exactly what is brilliant about this film- it shows us more than just the surface. On top of all, men who sleep with hookers get no sympathy whatsoever from me, but of course that does not mean they should all be killed. But just think about it; what reason did Aileen have not to kill, to hope for a better future, to love and feel sympathy for people? None, whatsoever.The film was extremely difficult to watch, but brilliant.",,Anonymous,Biography
Acting....As Good As It Gets.......,"Brilliant drama with an excellent script, direction and acting, deserving top marks. The lead actress is stunning in her performance.The story is based on a true life event of a street prostitute who goes on a killing spree. The reasons for that and her relationships in the film are riveting throughout. Now of course the real life events and persons are highly likely different from how the movie portrays them and the film gives a wholly sympathetic slant to the side of the killer. My brief research however on the killer is that she was an abused child and adult, she was likely mentally ill, and was undeserving the fate she ultimately received.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

I cannot stop thinking if there are something wrong in our system if there are someone like Ailee who was never given any chance since she/he was born. If only someone have helped her in the very beginning, maybe everything would be different, wait, we would not have this movie, either.As for acting, I really appreciate the performance from Christina Ricci as Shelby at least she need to be mentioned.

Great Acting - Bad Movie,"Everyone I knew could only describe this movie with one word -- ""disturbing"". This, of course, made me really want to see it. So I did. Guess what. Disturbing didn't describe it. Allow me to summarize this film in one word: ""boring"". Here's the basic premise of the film. A hideously ugly woman that is supposedly Charlize Theron plays a white trash Florida prostitute who meets an innocent and naive lesbian played by Christina Ricci. Charlize tries to straighten up after a bad incident with a John, but can't because she has no skills to get a job. That's as deep as I want to get, because I would be giving away the movie. This really wouldn't be a bad idea though, because watching the movie is torture. Charlize Theron does a remarkable job of acting, unfortunately, she picked a bad movie to decide to do that in. She's got quite the mouth on her. I've heard sailors that didn't curse like she does in this film. Christina Ricci is her typical self. She's the same character she is in every film. The biggest problem is that this film just drags along. It takes forever to get started. When it does, it doesn't go anywhere else for a long time. There was just too much filler time spent in between plot points.A very disappointing 3*",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Deserves every award she won,"Charlize Theron is incredible in this film, she deserves every accolade that she received. I cannot understand why a lot of people put her performance down because of the make up, prosthetics, weight gain etc. I'd challenge any ACTOR to transform themselves the way she did and to be so convincing and moving to an audience. She brought Eileen's story to a vast population and like it or hate it, Charlize gave a brutally honest portrayal in my opinion. After all, acting is about transformation so what's the problem with an actor changing their outer appearance as well as the inner????? This I do not understand and I feel sorry that a lot of people aren't seeing this performance due to their prejudice as they could certainly learn a lot from Charlize Theron.",,Anonymous,Biography

It's a treat for movie lovers to see a character so vulnerable, disturbed, restless with a disturbed and traumatic childhood being portrayed with depth and spontaneously.screenplay; it's a layered role, beautiful screenplay with enough areas for the character to improvise and explore giving us a convincing narrative and powerful storytelling. Many of the scenes are not glorified or over the head ,'keeping it real and raw, which adds to the authenticity of the mood and climate of the movie.

It would have been better if there was a scene or two of taking the supporting cast's police investigation.We would have wanted to see maybe little bit more on the investigative side as well, their leads and their progresses.

Absolutely Extraordinary and Stunning Performance from Charlize Theron,"Charlize Theron gives one of the greatest performances I've ever seen in this harrowing story of Aileen Wuornos, a prostitute who went on a killing spree and was sentenced to death for her crimes.Don't let anyone tell you that Theron's performance was only acclaimed because she allowed herself to get ""ugly"" for it. The same was said of Nicole Kidman's performance in ""The Hours"" from the year before. Yet when a male actor (like Robert De Niro in ""Raging Bull"") undergoes a physical transformation for a performance, he's congratulated for his commitment to his role.Theron's performance is riveting and devastating, and it would have been so even without the makeup. She creates a deeply complex and fascinating character, a woman we revile even as we sympathize with her. And Christina Ricci, who got almost no attention for her performance as Wuornos' young and impressionable lover, meets Theron scene for scene.One of the most deserved Oscar wins in history.Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Calling For Love,"""Monster"" is a film written and directed by Patty Jenkins. It is based on a true story of a Florida serial killer named Aileen Wournos. Charlize Theron stars as Aileen while Christina Ricci plays her helpless girlfriend Selby. Aileen opens the movie attempting suicide. The prostitute decides to spend her last five dollars she performed oral sex for, at the nearest bar with the intentions of not wasting her hard earned money. If God has a plan for her, now would be His last opportunity. After she gets a beer, she is approached by a young lesbian. She makes it clear that she is by no means gay, then becomes friends with the girl. They end up staying the night together and Aileen falls in love. Aileen asks the girl to run away with her. They live in a hotel off the earnings Aileen has made from whoring. One of her customers ends up raping her and attempts to kill her, but she ends up freeing herself and killing him. From then on, she decides to take her customer's money and lives, rather than to perform sexual favors for them, that is until the point when the faces of Aileen and Selby appear as wanted on the television. The critical intention of the movie is monitoring a woman crossing over from good to evil. It attempts to portray Aileen's last attempt to love someone or be loved by someone.An aspect of the movie that amazed me was the costume and make-up. The artists took one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood and turned her into a street hooker. I find it amazing that Charlize gained thirty pounds for the film. She really grasps the character of the movie. I also enjoyed the movie because it was based on a true story. I like watching or reading something that has actually happened because I feel like I can more relate to it. Something I didn't like about the movie was the vulgar language used. I thought it also concentrated on the love life between the two rather than the actual murders that Aileen committed. I think that the movie should have concentrated more on the murders because it is the significant part of Aileen's life. If the viewer enjoys crime and dramas, this movie might appeal to them, but the plot lagged and the ending was abrupt. This is not a movie I would recommend.",,Anonymous,Biography
Devastating,"What an astonishing film. Charlize Theron gives the best performance of her career, clearly the best performance of the year, AND one of the best performances I've ever seen. The swagger she effects to hide her lack of self-confidence and self-loathing for not being better than who she was, her vulnerability with Ricci's character, and her raw, naked, feral rage - all are pitch perfect, and displayed in scenes of undeniable power. Ricci is also excellent in a crucial role as a needy person, also starved for love and identity, to whom Wuornos turns for possibly the only source of love she ever finds in her life. It was also good to see Bruce Dern again in a small role. But this movie ultimately belongs to Theron, and her performance is indelible.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
one of the most powerful films i have ever experienced...,"I knew this was about a serial killer who killed other people. I knew that this was going to have a sad ending, which i usually don't like in films. I knew that there was going to be some pain involved in the characters lives. Yet I still watched it. A few hours later, I couldn't stop thinking about it.....Charlize Theron is absolutely spellbounding in this role as Aileen, who killed seven men as a prostitute. Though I don't approve of anyone killing people, you can't help but feel sympathetic to Aileen, due to the troubles in her life. I often wonder why the world works sometimes, why we're born into the lives that we have. This film is about trying to find purpose, despite of who you are; whether your gay, blind or whatever life gives you. All the performances are great, and Ricci is very good as a vulnerable and sensitive lover of Aileen. The ending really has you feeling gutted inside, especially the final words shown 'Selby and Aileen never spoke again.' The film is a love story in a dark world, showing how the judgements we make are usually the worst, but we never get to know someone inside...because we never look close enough.This isn't a film to watch if you don't want to feel overwhelmingly dead inside, but for those who do, the experience can open your eyes in many ways you couldn't imagine.

A sympathetic portrayal of a serial killer,"This film, based on real events, tells the story of Aileen Wuornos; a prostitute in Daytona Beach, Florida who went on to become America's first female serial killer. She is down to her last five dollars and contemplating suicide when she decides she might as well spend it on cheap beer in a local bar. Here she is approached by Selby Wall, a naïve young lesbian; the two get drinking and form an unlikely friendship. Unable to get regular work and needing money she returns to prostitution; a client attacks her and would probably have killed her if she didn't have a gun... instead he ended up dead. She takes his car and his money and hits the road with Selby. It isn't long before she kills again.Usually serial killers are rightfully portrayed as monsters, if based on real people, or somewhat charismatic if fictional; the portrayal of Aileen avoids both stereotypes. We see that her life is pretty terrible and her first victim is shown as fairly clear self-defence. As she progresses she behaves in a way that is clearly not justified but by then that degree of sympathy has already been evoked. The violence is shown in a fairly matter of fact way and in no way glamorised or made exciting. The relationship between Aileen and Selby feels real as does the way Selby naively accepts Aileen's version of how she got her money and 'borrowed' cars. Interestingly the story is centred on Aileen and Selby; we never learn about the police investigation apart from what our protagonists see on the news. Charlize Theron is on brilliant form as Aileen, it is little wonder she picked up an Oscar for her performance. Cristina Ricci also impresses as Selby making it easy to believe in her characters naivety. Writer/director Patty Jenkins did a fine job creating a feeling of desperation without making the film too depressing to enjoy. Overall I'd say that this film is definitely worth watching.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Vigilante or murderer?,"SpoilerAs Monster has not yet been shown in Hong Kong, I was particularly happy to catch it in Singapore before the Oscar results were out. Much have been said about Charlize Theron's top-notch performance, and her Oscar is indisputably deserved, after a deserving but somewhat controversial Nichole Kidman last year and an absolutely undeserving Halle Berry two years ago. My vote from the heart, however, goes to Keisha Castle-Hughes.Turning from Charlis Theron to Aileen Wuornos, the questions become whether the audience will accept the sympathetic portrayal, regardless of how brilliant is has been artistically. Here, I plead complete ignorance to the actual case, and rely on what the film depicts. Despite what Aileen said to Selby (Christina Ricci), that people gets murdered every day out there in the real world, murder is certainly beyond the realm of experience of an average person. While the film does not belabour the horrible childhood that Wuornos went through, the message is clear enough: that she is more of a victim than a criminal. But then, there is also a vigilante aspect, which reminds me of Charles Bronson's Death Wish (1974) which made the strongest statement in that regard. In both cases, some of the people murdered by the vigilante probably deserved to be killed. Death Wish is too long ago for me to remember the details. Wuornos' killings, however, are clearly not all vigilante. On the other hand, the film has taken care to show that Wuornos is not a psychopathic murderer turned loose, in the scene where she has the most rough-looking john. It seems that she is starting to lose control of herself, when the guy turns out to be milder than a pussycat, declaring that it's his first time. Looking disgusted, but also without a trace of sympathy, she satisfied him in the simplest and quickest way. When it's over, he whimpers an almost inaudible 'thank you' and her equally subdued 'you're welcome' might have been the only funny moment in the entire film. Yet it's also making a point, that Wuornos does not appear to be a completely mindless serial murderer.As I said, murder is something that is beyond the personal experience of most people and I am certainly thankful that I did not happen to be one of the people in the jury box in Wuornos' trial. To smaller, daily things, however, an average person can relate at closer range. Consider two similar scenes in a restaurant outburst in two movies: Wuornos when asked to put out a cigarette in a no-smoking restaurant and the character played by Jack Nicholson in 5 Easy Pieces (1970) at an obnoxious waitress. While we are prepared to cheer for the latter, it is not quite as easy to forgive the former.While Therons dominates the entire movie, Ricci holds her own in the portrayal of Selby, first in her wild-eye innocence, then subtly evolving as the relationship turns and twists. Although not quite Oscar calibre, Ricci's performance effectively complements Therons'. Ricci is also an actress with a unique air about her, blending beautifully into a movie like Sleepy Hollow (1999).",,Anonymous,Biography

Wow! Eerily good film,"First: Charlese Theron: If you are familiar with her from other films, and are looking for more of her really good looks, her figure, and her typically lovely smile, then this is decidedly NOT the film for you! I think, for this film, she may have put on about 20lbs, wore some ugly false teeth, and her appearance is hardly recognizable! She looks ugly in this film -- and this is part of her (real life) character, Aileen. I could not believe this person was Charlese Theron! She REALLY uglied-up for this movie. One more time: those makeup artists are masters! They REALLY did a number on normally-lovely Charlese for this film!The Story: Do any of you out there recall the creepy, chill-inducing feelings you had when seeing ANYTHING about Charles Manson and/or his 'Family'? Well, this film gave me very similar (creepy) feelings!!! This film is also not merely fiction -- it fairly accurately portrays a real-life serial killer who was really executed for her crimes. I think WIKI says she got about eight death sentences for her 'activities'. You may wish to pop over to read WIKI's account sometime during/before/after watching this film as I did.Overall, I think the very-positive accolades Charlese received for her performance as Aileen in this film are well-deserved.

"Phenomenal, deeply moving","I read the featured review for this film and I found it to be grossly over critical and unfair. While I agree that the film shows Aileen in a victim's light, I am not convinced that this perspective is entirely unfactual. I did not know Aileen, but I find the film plausible and I guess part of me wants to believe that someone who did all those murders was doing them with the kind of rationale that was hypothesized in this movie. It makes the acts almost understandable that way.At any rate, the story that the film does tell was deeply moving and powerful. I think that critics forget that a film says, ""based"" on a true story for a reason. It is not always the intention or responsibility of the director/artists to deliver the complete real story. A film like this is art, and it presents itself that way. Therefore, I think it can be seen as an important story about the human condition (regardless of actual events or facts) -love, acceptance and survival.There are only three adequate words for Charlize Theron's performance -""OH MY GOD!"" I didn't even realize who she was until the movie was almost over. I haven't seen footage of the real Aileen, so I won't evaluate the likeness or lack thereof achieved by Theron. All I can say is, I haven't seen acting that good since Cecily Tyson did Ms. Jane Pittman 20+ years ago (with the exception of maybe Pacino in Scarface, and Kingsley in Ghandi). Theron put herself in a completely different category of acting when she delivered this performance, which was absolutely unforgettable and truly scary. I was totally absorbed in her character,. The emotional depth and complexity she brought was off the charts! This film DOES NOT LACK FOCUS (as the featured reviewer claims), Theron does not overdo it, and there was plenty of stuff going on that moved the film along.This film will stay with me for many years. It affected me deeply, and personally as a human being to be taken to a world of such pain, loneliness and hopelessness. I think its greatest achievement was that it strongly reminds us of how important real love is.A++++++++++ Charlize and Patty. EXCELLENT JOB! You GO GIRLS!!!!!!!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Two superlatives apply to writer/director Patty Jenkins' `Monster': best actress and grimmest film of 2003.,"Two superlatives apply to writer/director Patty Jenkins' `Monster': best actress and grimmest film of 2003. Charlize Theron (`The Italian Job') transformed physically (30 pounds and prominent prosthetic teeth) and mentally (Theron not for a second leaves her character) into serial killer Aileen Wuornos.  Theron is every reason to see this account of an abused, disturbed hooker turned murderer (convicted in 1992 of at least 6 murders, one probably in self defense); nothing else in the film is unusual storytelling or acting, not even graphically as compelling as this sure Oscar nominee. She embodies Brendan Francis's description of prostitutes as `women of action. Talk is not their stock in trade.'The grimness of the film comes directly out of the subject matter: a story about a prostitute without Julia Roberts in the lead or a benign twist just won't keep an American audience's attention, especially if there is more graphic display in a current teenage slasher flick. So the audience for `Monster' is likely to squirm at the least or be revolted at Aileen's rough persona and meaningless life, filmed in dark tones with little color, not even much red blood. The intellectual satisfaction of understanding how this murderer got into a violent mess cannot mitigate the desire to leave the theater the way you would leave a smoky bar because you were stuck next to a sweaty biker dude with garish tattoos and a foul mouth.Christina Ricci (`The Ice Storm') plays Aileen's 18-year-old Ohio lesbian friend, Selby, in such a mysterious way as to make it uncertain if she is acting well or not at all. Selby eventually testifies against Aileen, but even during their most passionate moments as lovers, where Aileen acts out the male, protective role, Selby's motivation for her attraction to Aileen is unclear and hardly believable given the physical, social, and emotional distance between the two.Theron trumps easily last year's Oscar winner Nicole Kidman in `The Hours,' where her nose could hardly compete with Theron's entire body.  Kidman's understated Virginia Woolf required much less range than Theron's sneering, fleshy, manic Aileen Wuornos. Closest to Theron's triumph is Hillary Swank's 1999 Oscar winning performance as Teena Brandon turned Brandon Teena in `Boys Don't Cry, ` another tragic story of a sexual misfit and murder. Though Swank's performance required a more refined protagonist than Theron's, both actresses made the bizarre believable.Naomi Watts in `21 grams' and Patricia Clarkson in `Station Agent' and `Pieces of April' are worthy of 2003 Oscar nominations. They will have to wait, however, until another year, for this one belongs to Charlize Theron, an actress so attractive in `Cider House Rules' that I thought she would never compromise her blonde, cherry-lipped supremacy.  She did, and she will win for that surrender.",,Anonymous,Biography

Perhaps if she were a high priced call girl like Hiedi Fleiss, we might have more weighty material here..but afterall, it is murder, and murder sells!

Not very much, I think, but the portrayal is very different because while Gacy and many other serial killers were not given an apology for their actions, this woman was given an apology because, well, putting women in a bad light and demonizing that is perhaps the biggest taboo what exists.If a woman kills, she must have had a good reason for it, and that is the whole point of this film.Would this approach ever be possible with the character Bundy as the subject? Never during his life, even if that story were true.Recently I saw the same title again, but it concerned Dahmer's story, here too the approach is the same, although the perpetrator's past was discussed more in detail, but here too he does not have to count on compassion.Perhaps rightly so, but why does this woman needs to receive our sympathy?",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

Double Standards,"Critics were enthralled with Charlize Theron's transformation into real life serial killer Aileen Wuornos. She won the Oscar that year from the Academy that's fond of attractive stars making themselves unpretty. I'll concede that this a fine piece of acting, but the landscape in reality has drastically changed. The tone here is too much. No one wants to poke the elephant in the room for fear of being labelled, but 'Monster' makes excuses for a horrible person basely solely on the fact she's female.Aileen (Theron) came from a broken home. Abused from an early age, she becomes an outcast then a prostitute but dreams of being better. Years of this finally crush any remaining hope until she meets Selby (Christina Ricci). From then on, she lives for this relationship. First as friends, but then as more. After a customer gets violent and it turns deadly she tries to go straight, but it doesn't take. Back to hooking, she develops a taste for killing men to sustain her life with Selby.I always take ""based on a true story"" with a heavy grain of salt. It's a throwaway marketing line that way too many people still buy into. Staying true to events, characters, everything else is secondary to writer & director Patty Jenkins. Aileen's image is softened and her involvement with a fictional Selby made sympathetic. Goes to great lengths to paint this picture that men are scum, society is cruel, etc.Veteran actor Bruce Dern provides the only fleshed out supporting role. You appreciate his humanity that is until the movie can't resist giving him a speech that comes off by & large condoning her killing ways. I challenge anyone to find a mainstream film about a real life male serial killer where it downplays his disgusting actions. My guess? You won't.There's this feminist tone here that it wasn't her fault. Many people are down on their luck. Have sad pasts or turn to sex work to make ends meet. They don't become serial killers. This is the issue with 'Monster'. An irresponsible piece of filmmaking pushing a certain type of agenda before it was in vogue. Next time the subject of gender equality comes up remember this film.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Grossly Disappointed,"MONSTER, one big lesbian love story, totes Charlize Theron as a serial killing prostitute. Dark and Disturbing it was not. While Charlize Theron gave one heck of a performance, the movie completely fell short. The first half of the movie was worse then watching paint dry but luckily picked up the pace to a slow jog during the last half.The connection and transformation Charlize made with her character (Aileen Wuornos) was outstanding! But with that aside there is nothing more to draw you into this story.Everyone has commented on ""rooting for the bad guy"" in this movie and I am failing to understand why. Maybe it was the fact they did not divulge to much into her past or maybe it is just that I cant feel for a psychotic serial killing lesbian prostitute.

It's all about Charlize Theron,When I first heard about this movie being made I was a little suspicious at first. Being that it was a movie based on a real-life serial killer and a high profile one at that. I went ahead and watched it and was happily suprised. Charlize Theron really ran the show in this film. She did an excellent job in potraying a hooker/lesbian/serial killer. Christina Ricci was the backbeat and added that much more to the movie. The movie was both believable and enjoyable and I would highly recommend it to anyone.I gave it a 9/10,9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Oh My,"Charlie Theron won the best actress Oscar portraying Aileen Wuornos in this true life crime drama. Christina Ricci is Selby, her lesbian soul mate. The movie is more of a love story than the usual serial killer thriller we are used to seeing. Theron is so good that I felt as if I was watching a documentary. Ricci is also quite good as the clueless love interest Selby. The violence is there, but not overwhelming, and in the end, we have no one and nothing to root for, but Theron and the underrated Ricci make Monster well worth watching.

Monster - you've been Hollywooded!,"What is it about Hollywood movies? They can be really, really good - like this one - and yet, by the time the credits roll, you feel unmistakably Hollywooded; identified and labelled as ""target audience"", and then expertly manipulated using tried-and-trusted cinematic devises. You end up feeling slightly patronised and used.Well, Hollywood this movie definitely is, but if you are prepared to surrender to the ride, ""Monster"" is an extremely effective movie. You will be told what questions to ask (""Surely Serial Killers are evil people, aren't they?""), what conclusions to draw (""Gosh - you mean given the right circumstance, even I could wind up a serial killer!""). Ultimately, you will question capital punishment and despite the grisliness of it all, you will feel the warm fuzziness of real love.What makes ""Monster"" exceptional however, are the performances. Theron is especially remarkable - authentic, intense and involving. We are given just enough information to piece together the character's history and understand her motivation. We are shown just enough of her crimes to challenge our condoning of them.The violence is deeply unpleasant without being in any way gratuitous; the lesbian love story is passionate and tender without being remotely erotic.A well manufactured film worth seeing once.

"Woman of Character, NOT!","This movie was one that was very difficult to watch, however, if you are interested in seeing an authentic story about one of America's only documented female serial killers, this is the one that will be true to the story.

She takes the character and makes you almost understand ""why"" Eileen is as bad as she is, only to the point that you ""get it."" She was executed in 2002, and rightfully so, but Charlize brings so much to this woman's character to life that she almost makes you feel sorry for her....But not really.

The film's worth seeing for Charlize Theorn's stunning performance1!!!!!,"Model-turned-actress Charlize Theron leaves her glamorous image behind for this gritty drama, in which she plays a disturbed prostitute who becomes a serial killer. Aileen Wuornos (Theron) was a woman who survived a brutal and abusive childhood in Michigan to become a thick-skinned but emotionally damaged adult. Homeless most of her life, Wuornos subsisted by working as a street prostitute; later, when she was in Florida, down to her last five dollars and pondering suicide, she stopped into a bar for a beer. There, Aileen met Selby Wall (Christina Ricci), a woman in her early twenties who had been sent to live with relatives after her Christian parents became aware of her lesbian lifestyle. Selby is immediately attracted to Aileen, and while Aileen tells Selby she's never been in a lesbian relationship, she soon finds herself equally infatuated with her. Selby runs away from her family and moves into a cheap hotel with Aileen, who initially pays the bills by hooking. However, as their money runs low and Aileen finds herself unable to land a regular job, tensions mount between the two. One night, after a john attacks her, Aileen pulls a gun and kills the man. Although her first murder can be categorized as self-defense, Aileen's loathing for the men who pay her for sex becomes so extreme that she begins killing her customers regardless of their behavior. Meanwhile, Selby slowly becomes aware of the full extent of her lover's instability and the bloody consequences of her actions. Monster was inspired by the true story of Aileen Wuornos, whose life and death was chronicled in two documentaries by filmmaker Nick Broomfield, Aileen Wuornos: The Selling of a Serial Killer, and Aileen: The Life and Death of a Serial Killer.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Patty Jenkins executes a difficult, disturbing biopic with enthusiasm. As a writer, he writes each dialog from the gallery, thus, making each word sound brash.

Charlize Theron IS the Monster!,"Honestly, I've never had too high of an opinion of Charlize Theron.. Flat in The Astronaut's Wife and Cider House Rules (which is a great movie nevertheless), I was apprehensive to see this, even though I saw this just recently, nearly a year and a half after she won the Academy Award for it. Playing with the ""The more makeup the better"" approach to getting her award, Theron nevertheless plays Aileen Wounds, a prostitute-turned-killer who was profiled in the great Nick Bantock doc, ""Aileen Wournos, The Selling Of A Serial Killer"". Theron plays her to a T here, getting the mannerisms quite awesomely, to the point where it's almost scary. Her special ""friend"", Selby, played brilliantly here by Christina Ricci, is broken whether to stand by her, or run, when the money starts getting low. This is a consequential decision, something that makes her as guilty as Wournos in my opinion. Both of them play off of each other so well, and it's a shame that Christina Ricci (who I've always liked) didn't get a nom as well.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

She shows that Aileen was very ordinary, who had just been kicked in the teeth time & time again by life.

Many times I sat in the theater on the edge of bored-only to be aroused by the talent displayed. Then it was back to the same old thing. There were moments of insight and clarity, but it was too far between them.Although I cannot expect every film to blow me to the back of my seat with every shot, I was expecting something more considering the fact that the entirety of the subject matter could fill volumes about Eileen's life.Instead, she was a plain old hooker with a gun. Maybe that's how she really was, but it wasn't quite enough.Theron's OSCAR notwithstanding, there's really no meat to this film. Surely, she deserved the award; however, I find it sad that she had to win it for this particular piece of cinema.Really, I can't say that this is a bad film; only that it is not a great film, which is bad enough considering the talent arrayed.I can only give this a `5' out of `10,' making this just average.  `Monster' is indeed a film filled with great roles, but the wrapping wasn't enough for it.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

I cannot speak for the authenticity of this performance, but I can say that she managed to turn a character that I went into the film expecting to hate into one of the most sympathetic souls that I have ever seen. Ricci does an admirable job of playing second fiddle here. (I swear, you can almost see it in her face that she knew that Theron was turning in one of the best performances ever here.)

Monster! A More Apt Title I Am Yet To See!,"Aileen Wouris was indeed a ""monster"". Anyone who so callously takes the lives of five individuals in cold blood cannot be described any other way. I mention cold blood only in relation to five of the murders as Wouris' defence for the first murder she committed was based on self defence. The movie then worked very hard to find the reason which she CHOSE to continue killing. I become very suspicious when perpetrators of violent crimes reflect on certain incidents in their life that may have led them to that point and seek redemption and maybe even a certain amount of empathy and compassion from the general populous for their actions. I am not saying that Aileen Wouris herself was looking for sympathy but there is no doubt that director of Monster, Patty Jenkins certainly decided to portray the character of Wouris almost to the point where she was being portrayed as a victim. That is what I found most offensive about this movie. Life is largely about making CHOICES. I recognize and appreciate that Wouris had a tortured upbringing but that doesn't justify ANY of her actions: a point of view obviously not shared with Jenkins who, as well as directing, also wrote the screenplay after having some correspondence with Wouris herself. Why did I choose to watch this film in the first place? The answer is quite simple.I had read the reviews and was aware of the film's content. I wanted to see for myself what I had heard was a breathtaking performance from Charlize Theron. I have scored this unpleasant film higher than I may have otherwise simply on the back of Theron's performance which was simply masterly. I will ponder for some time the effort made by this actress to put herself quite literally in the mind (and body) of a deranged individual who, apparently all because of her sad and sorry upbringing, CHOSE to take the lives of different men in a cold and calculated manner. We all make CHOICES in our lives and a lot of us have to deal with terrible difficulties and tumultuous emotional and physical upheaveals whilst growing up.

I have been putting this one off for a decade, because it never seemed like the ""right"" time to watch a downer movie. But you know what? I realized that if I wait until it is the ""right"" time to discover how bad some people have it, I will never know. Oh, I feel for my patients---homeless, unemployed, uninsured because they have a disability. But today I FELT for them. And I realized something. Nature is not fair.

While others of us were intended to live in normal homes, with normal nurturing parents and normal food and normal everything, never rocking the boat, never asking for more----and when these folks get f****d over as children, there is no way that they are gonna survive intact. It is probably a good defensive strategy for the species as a whole. Have some people who thrive in times of tragedy and who are bored out of their minds the rest of the time.

A superb film.,"Italo Calvino's 1972 masterpiece, Invisible Cities, beautifully delineates realms of mind: some that counterpoint each other while others falling within the harmonic progressions of existence.  The complexity of being is rarely depicted as successfully as in the film Monster.  The story is not new nor is it fiction: The violation of a young girl essentially ends any chance of her living a normal life and she is thus thrown into a timeless path of degradation and progressive declination.  What is new here is the power in the volume of truth brought to this production by its creators.The well-crafted script enters into levels of truth rarely encountered in the American cinema, especially in today's industry.   Its subtlety is intertwined with ironies and its brutality plays out in both concord and chaos to her final destruction by the blind justice of today's American, Hammurabian society.What is also genuinely new here is the astonishing performance of Charlize Theron, an actor originally from South Africa whose past work includes modeling and playing quiet beauties.  Here we are treated to a mounting level of skills in the past secluded by the press of her beauty.   The greatest surprise is that she was able to make the quantum leap from her past profile into the central arena of screen actors with levels of power not seen for decades.   She plays the 1980's female serial killer, Aileen Carol Wuornos, with deftness, fervor and nuance that is agonizing and at the same time wondrous to behold.  She looks, acts and smells like gutter trash. We feel her painful hunger for human contact at the same time the desperate loathing that she has for her victimizers.  In a final, perhaps planned irony, her final victim, perhaps the only innocent one, is played with great pathos by the extraordinary character actor Scott Wilson who long ago mesmerized us as one of the killers in Truman Capote's In Cold Blood.It is also important here to bow to the recent newcomer writer-director Patty Jenkins who with this work has also grabbed off the gold ring.  Italo Calvino would smile at this extraordinary, robust and unforgettable film.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Good flick, but too long and why Charlize Theron?","This movie kept me glued to the edge of my seat longer than it probably should have. The director probably could've cut about 30 minutes out of the middle without anyone noticing the difference.Ricci was pretty convincing as Selby--her performance, makeup and camera angles made Selby look a lot shorter and younger than I remembered Ricci. Theron's portrayal of Lee was okay, but a little overdone. Worse, Lee's voice seemed to become Theron's voice at times. The extensive makeup job and the tattered clothes couldn't conceal the starlet underneath. My question is: Why in the world did Theron get this role? While she played it well enough to convince me that she's marginally able to be something other than a softhearted seductress, surely the director could've found someone more convincing and cheaper. Are we so addicted to the clique of top-name actors that we can't recognize a quality movie when we see one?Still, I liked the movie as a character sketch. As in life, most of the characters were ambiguous. However, I wasn't too impressed with the movie's blanket portrayal of Christians as sexually repressed and emotionally abusive. Surely, at least one of the Christian characters could've been at least a little less warped.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Haunting Portrait of Despair and Decay,"The way Charlize Theron portrayed Aileen Wuornos was revolutionary. Her remarkable physical and emotional metamorphosis won her the Academy Award for Best Actress. The picture gains depth via Jennifer Jason Leigh's uncredited role as one of Aileen's victims. Aileen's environment is depicted with brutal authenticity by Patty Jenkins' unwavering and uncompromising direction.However, the film's pacing might feel uneven at times, with certain sequences dragging while others feel rushed. Furthermore, there are times when the emphasis on Aileen and Selby's relationship borders on melodrama, which takes away from the usually realistic grit. ""Monster"" is a harrowing yet vital viewing for anybody interested in character-driven storytelling and true crime stories. Though difficult to see, the film's uncompromising depiction of Aileen's spiral into madness is heartbreaking and thought-provoking. Theron's portrayal in particular, as well as Jenkins' ability to strike a balance between Aileen's brutal reality and ephemeral human moments, are the film's strongest points.To sum up, ""Monster"" is a biting critique of society's shortcomings as well as an example of how resilient people can be when faced with extreme hardship. A comprehensive investigation of identity, pain, and justice is presented in the picture, moving it beyond simple exploitation thanks to Patty Jenkins' directing and Charlize Theron's remarkable performance. ""Monster"" is not a movie for the weak of heart, yet it stays with you long after the last credits have rolled, forcing you to face your own ideas about humanity and morality. Because of its bravery and unashamed examination of the darker aspects of human nature, I heartily endorse it.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Never did I think that this wasn't the character but the actor during the movie.That reason alone makes me give this movie a 10. Excellent. A must watch if you like art.I find art to be anything that movies me emotionally one way or another. I will have a hard time forgetting this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Monumental Performance by Charlize Theron-A Great Film,"A Monumental Performance by Charlize Theron-A Great FilmIn October 2002 the State of Florida killed serial murderer Aileen Wuornos after she languished on Death Row for a dozen years. Her guilt was never in serious doubt. The fascination she held for many is that she was that true rarity of crime annals-the female who sequentially took the lives of men.Historically, some men have always been both fascinated by and perhaps intelligently afraid of women who might kill them. In the England of the Tudors the greatest crime was treason, a personal affront to the person of the sovereign. Interestingly, a close runner-up was ""petit treason,"" the murder of a husband by his wife. In English legal history, morbid accounts of women using their special weapon, poison, appear with bone-chilling regularity.""Monster"" is what could be simply called a biopic of one of America's few known female serial killers (especially those who operate alone. Homicidal distaff accomplices of men are a dime a dozen.).The Charlize Theron of ""Monster"" isn't the seductive and beautiful woman of ""Sweet November"" or ""The Italian Job."" Thanks to incredible work by the make-up people she has stepped into Aileen's body and side-by-side photos of the two can lead some to be confused as to who is who. Theron is a bedraggled, scraggly-haired, unkempt, often drunk vulgarian whose clothes don't fit and whose body almost emanates from the screen a chronically putrid odor.More important than the physical adaptation, Theron has taken on Wuornos's troubled psyche, her mannerisms, her coarse and vulgar speech as if it were her own. Closely and accurately tracking the last year of Wuornos's life before incarceration, Theron co-opts viewers for a strange and fearful ride through the near-slums of Florida.Wuornos became a hooker at age thirteen, turning tricks to survive. Apparently she never had a homosexual relationship until she met and teamed up with Selby (not her real name, the imprint of reviewing attorneys being clear). Christina Ricci is the teenage Selby and she portrays Aileen's young friend and lover with a convincing mix of what the real woman must have been like. First she's an explorer in the world of gay relationships, then an acolyte of the commanding but affection bestowing older woman, then a manipulative and exploitative spoiled child who is both repelled by her knowledge of the killings but also unwilling to lose a ""sugar mommy."" Ricci's intense Selby is not a nice person.Wuornos began killing with a gun as she unleashed long suppressed hatred of rapacious (literally) men. Her first shooting, paradoxically, was the only one justified by both law and morality. The rest were inexcusable on any legal theory (including insanity. This woman, despite what some have argued, was not psychotic and she was competent to both stand trial and be punished. She demonstrated, as does Theron, a warped but rational view of the state of equal protection law when she cursed the trial judge for sentencing ""a white woman to death."")Selby and Aileen, always called ""Lee,"" are on a perpetual road trip to, in reality, nowhere. Wuornos feels a net closing in on her but she can't restrain her behavior. She fantasizes a happy, loving life with Selby even while her demons warn her it won't happen. Theron's projection of this woman who so wanted love and affection from Selby and could only return it in a controlling albeit deep sense is gripping. Part of her brilliant performance is that she shows the complicated and evanescent moods of the killer. One minute the audience feels sorry for her plight, the next revulsion at her deeds.The title of the film might well be a simple description of the murdering prostitute. But it also may be seen as being provocatively ambiguous. Aileen was no monster when her father's friend raped her at age eight. She was no monster when her father brutally beat her for telling him of the rape, thereby insuring a continuation of the atrocity. She was no monster when she took up prostitution at age 13, hoping with the demagnetized moral compass of a wounded teenager that she might find a man who would really love and respect her.But some of the men in this film are true monsters and recognizing that in no way alleviates her guilt. Men who pay for perverted sex and need violence to enjoy physical intimacy: they are as warped as the homicidal hooker who ended their depredations. But, usually, they aren't accountable for their behavior.Theron arrives at a new acting plateau with ""Monster."" She's on the cover of Time Out New York's current issue. But today only one theater in New York is screening this powerful, monumental work. It deserves the widest circulation.Theron co-produced ""Monster"" and director Patty Jenkins wrote the screenplay, largely based on police reports, news accounts and - most importantly - Wuornos's letters.I don't think Aileen Wuornos could have been rehabilitated ever. But I do believe we diminished ourselves by executing a victim of evil and perversion. Aileen Wuornos in one manner or another was doomed from childhood. And there are many others like her although few will become serial killers.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Performance and story great,"Despite many comments that Theron's performance is great but that there is no story, I disagree heartily. If you are looking for a cops and robbers detective story ending in a trial type of film, then skip this one. Instead, it shows the deterioration of a character in front of your eyes, going from someone starry-eyed and desperately seeking love to trying to live a ""normal"" life without any clue to being a victim  and ending up completely out of touch with reality. Theron plays the perfect tragic character in that Wuornos is fated to be doomed. It may not be true to the historical version (the trial, Wuornos in the limelight), but it is a great character study and one of the most amazing performances I have ever seen on film. It is not uplifting though and may be a real downer for you.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
How could anyone even pose a threat to Charlize Theron?,"I really need to see the other movies that had a Best Actress nominated to see why Charlize Theron wasn't a slam dunk for the Oscar.  She was NOTHING short of brilliant.Her acting job in this movie was indescribably impeccable.  The range and depth isn't even worth commenting on, because words could not do it justice.I've heard that people were amazed by her performance but disappointed with the movie, and I don't know how they can think that.  She is in nearly (except for a few short scenes with just Christina Ricci) every scene in the movie (which is an incredible feat to pull off so well).The movie was depressing, gruesome, heartbreaking, and phenomenal.  I had to sit for a little bit through the credits to gather myself after being hit so hard with such a ""downer,"" yet amazing, movie.Anyone who just loves to keep up with the Academy Award nominations, or appreciates incredible acting should definitely treat themselves to this.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A charming love story,"I am of course lying. This movie is about as charming as a cockroach in your pudding cup. Monster is a tale of abuse, addiction, murder and codependent lesbian love. I don't think your mother would approve of this movie.So, what does Mom know? Monster is not a happy movie; there is no uplifting message buried in this screenplay. In Monster, the downtrodden stay down, the villains don't always get their comeuppance and innocence is no protection against evil. You won't leave the theater with a warm glow or a spring in your step but you won't leave feeling like you wasted $9, either. Monster tells a gritty, harsh, depressing and dark story. Monster also happens to be a very good movie.Monster's central character is both hero and villain. Into her life comes the one thing that can make it worth living, again: love. Sadly, our hero-villain's life has already twisted her beyond repair and she chooses some rather unorthodox methods of keeping her new affair from falling apart. I won't waste many more words describing this movie's content. Suffice it to say that love really can make people do strange things.I found Monster to be deeply moving. Most screenplays that involve homosexuality tend to caricature either the relationship or its participants. I think that Monster handled the issue very well with both Aileen and Selby displaying real human emotions and reactions. In the early stages of Aileen's relationship with Selby, the passion is intense and easily felt by the audience. Charlize Theron delivers an astounding performance that leaves no room for doubt about her skill as an actress and Christina Ricci's Selby is very believable as the selfish insecure center of Aileen's new life. Both performances are suitably powerful. As with other films of its type, I do think Monster falls into the trap of trying to make the main character more sympathetic than she deserves but it's nearly impossible to not feel empathy for Aileen.If for no other reason, I recommend Monster because it is unlike most other movies you will see. The movie industry cranks out a lot of raw footage of film every year but most of it falls easily into one of the handful of formulae we are used to seeing. Monster is not entirely immune to this formulaic style of moviemaking but enough of it is uniquely Monster that you won't find yourself thinking, ""I've seen this movie a dozen times already."" I think that's a Very Good Thing.Monster: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Superb Performance By Charlize Theron,"Generally speaking, I've always enjoyed both the work and the movies of Charlize Theron, and even on occasion when I've not particularly enjoyed the movie, Theron's performances have impressed me. Having said that, everything else she's done pales in comparison to this superb performance as Aileen Wuornos - the real-life prostitute/murderess, who killed several johns in 1989-90 before being arrested and ultimately executed. I would never have thought of Theron - who is a very beautiful woman - being able to pull off this part as a run-down, ""weather beaten"" street hooker, and yet she did it brilliantly.The portrayal of Wuornos was surprisingly sympathetic, I thought, given the circumstances. Although there was nothing portrayed of her childhood, the stories she shares make the point that it was pretty tough, and the portrayal of the initial murder makes clear that it was self-defense, but it began a spiral downward, which was accelerated by her growing lesbian relationship with Selby (Christina Ricci), which seemed sincere enough, and which made the need for money to support both of them more desperate. That relationship itself adds to the sympathy felt for the two, as both are clearly troubled women in need of some love and tenderness who, at least for a time, find both with each other.The story seems reasonably accurate, although ""Selby"" was not the actual name of Aileen's lover. Theron and Ricci had good on-screen chemistry together, and the story itself is quite riveting and, given the circumstances and what could have been done with it, not as graphic as it could have been - and I say that in a positive way. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Acting Tour de Force,"When I was watching this movie I asked myself how on earth someone as coarse, and raw looking as the Aileen character could ever have become a movie actress. When I saw in the credits it was the glamorous Charlize Theron from Cider House Rules I just about fell out of my chair.She plays an obnoxious whore, drunken, loutish, belligerent, crazy.Yet you stay sympathetic even as she becomes deranged and murders. She is completely believable with the pulled down sneer, the accent and the body language. Even the drinking scenes were completely believable.It could be described as a bleak version of Thelma and Louise. It is grim and makes the point, life is not fair, nowhere near.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Broken Lives and Brutal Choices: A Review of Monster,"Monster (2003), directed by Patty Jenkins and starring Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci, tells the harrowing true story of Aileen Wuornos, a woman who became one of America's most infamous serial killers. Jenkins also wrote the screenplay, and the film was produced by Mark Damon, Clark Peterson, and Donald Kushner. This biographical crime drama showcases Theron's incredible transformation, which won her an Academy Award for Best Actress. Ricci delivers a poignant performance as Selby, Aileen's girlfriend, a character inspired by Wuornos' real-life partner Tyria Moore.The story follows Aileen, a prostitute in Florida, who, after a traumatic series of events, begins murdering her clients in an attempt to survive and protect herself. As the film delves into Aileen's troubled past, it portrays her growing desperation and toxic relationship with Selby. What makes Monster stand out is its portrayal of Aileen not just as a criminal but as a deeply broken woman who, despite her horrifying actions, elicits sympathy from the audience. Jenkins frames her descent into violence with the complexity of her struggle for love, redemption, and escape from the cycle of abuse that has defined her life.The film's cinematography, handled by Steven Bernstein, mirrors the bleakness of Wuornos' existence. Muted tones, grim settings, and close-up shots of Wuornos' emotional turmoil contribute to the somber atmosphere, reflecting her deteriorating mental and emotional state. The soundtrack is kept minimal, allowing the raw performances, particularly Theron's, to drive the emotional intensity of the story. This creative decision draws viewers into Aileen's world, making her internal struggles even more palpable.Monster is not a film for everyone. The subject matter-sexual violence, murder, and emotional trauma-can be extremely difficult to watch. The pacing may feel slow at times, as it dedicates significant attention to Wuornos' internal battles and darker life experiences. For viewers sensitive to such topics, I would not recommend this movie, as its graphic and emotional intensity may be overwhelming and potentially distressing.In conclusion, Monster is not just a crime drama, but a deeply unsettling character study brought to life by Theron's incredible acting and Jenkins' empathetic direction. While it offers a powerful narrative and performances, the intense content requires caution for those sensitive to heavy and disturbing themes.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Audacity, Craft and Humanity","It's not that there's not the occasional film about unattractive women, or average-looking without magic cheekbones, with enough body fat to feasibly menstruate. It's that they'll hire statuesque, ideal blondes who'll gain artistic weight, sit for three hours of makeup to facilitate the appearance of a simple human being like the rest of us. Should a film about a real person be in competition for a Best Makeup Oscar? Nevertheless, all the same, what Theron pulls off isn't a performance but an incarnation. With audacity, craft and humanity, she purely draws us into Aileen Wuornos' final frantic attempt to be a better person than her luck proposed. Her performance is so concentrated and forceful that it becomes a reality for us. There's no trace of negligence in her eyes as she directly imparts what she's feeling and thinking. There's the eerie impression that she's forgotten the camera and script, candidly focusing her notions of Wuornos.Watching this, I've no awareness of makeup procedure. I simply watch one of the realest people on the screen. The movie opens with Aileen telling God she's down to her last $5, that if God doesn't lead her to spend it right she'll end it all. She walks into what happens to be a lesbian bar and meets the 18-year-old Selby, who's been sent to live with Florida relatives and be ""cured."" Aileen's steadfast that she's had no lesbian encounters, and to be sure her rundown life as a bottom-rung hooker's left her with no predilection for sex at all. Selby's own sexuality works effectively as a way to offend her fundamentalist parents and indulge her longing to be wanted. There's a striking scene when the two bond with unrefined sexual vigor, but in time sex is irrelevant judged against distraction, watching TV, and acting out their personal soap in second-rate curb motels.Monster's partially derived from the real Wuornos' prison letters to an associate recounting her life and her despairing relationship with Selby Wall, but you can't help but wonder how can we bank on what she says about herself? How can we be sure about those letters' truth or sentiments? Certainly, there'd be truthfulness to be found in them, detecting hidden meaning, analyzing, deciphering, but Monster plays so directly that there are no angles to contemplate, no veils we might be on the brink of peeling away. However, that's the irony of telling the story not as an omniscient investigative report but as a subjective dramatization: Aileen was an wild, unrestrained personality behind a face aged before its time, devastated by sun, booze and all varieties of cruelty. Psychotic, maybe. Beset with rage, unquestionably. Not a sound woman at all, whether or not she'd never killed.Aileen's proudly the guardian and bread-winner, also bringing back cars that Selby doesn't ask too many questions about. Does she know that Aileen has begun snuffing her customers? She does and doesn't. Aileen's murder binge becomes considerable long before Selby focuses on it. The crimes themselves are set off by Aileen's hatred for prostitution, a lifetime's disgust for how men have treated her since she was a child. She's but one male friend, a devastated Vietnam vet and fellow drunk. Although she first kills in self-defense, she's also lashing out against her past. Her encounter of love with Selby brings revolt disentangling from her memories. The most disturbing scene is the death of a good man who truly wants to help her, but has appeared so late in her life that the only way he can help is to be gotten rid of. Aileen tells her story, and her voice, both narrating and on-screen, seems from some angle to be the vehicle for the story, if not its whole reason for being. But each character within it speaks with their own voice.Aileen's body language is startling and captivating. She doesn't know how to inhabit her body. Theron spends a range of small arm straightening, physical adjustments, head tosses, hair touchings, as she apprehensively attempts to shake out her anxiety and look composed. She handles her cigarettes with the insecure bluster of a 13-year-old trying to make an impact on a kid. There's but one moment in Monster when she appears comfortable, content with herself. The scene will account for itself.Christina Ricci finds perfect pitch for Selby, so persuasive some take it for bad acting, when actually she's very moving in her rendering of a poor actor. She plays Selby as naive, weak, in over her head, picking up signals moment-to-moment, paving her actions out of ideas sponged from bad movies, old songs, barroom romances. Selby must've walked into a gay bar for the first time just a few weeks ago, and looked anxiously to fathom how to present herself. Selby and Aileen frequently try to extemporize the next line they imagine the other wants to hear.Despite questions outside the material itself, Monster declines to objectify Wuornos and her acts of violence, to take advantage of her legend in the disparaging approach of true-crime sensationalism, persevering in seeing her as a fully dimensional person entitled to our consideration. She's been so viciously misshapen by life that she seems incapable of decency, yet when she loves for the first time, she's moved to strive to be a better person.She's tragically unfit for this mêlée, and doesn't have the assistance of cleverness and reason. She's empty of normal honorable principles. She's brash, uncontrolled, outraged. There's no justification for what she does, but there are causes. The aim of the movie's to bring them to the fore. If life had given her anything whatsoever to use, it'd be a much different story.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Unique humanitarian tell of a serial killer's life.,"First time in my life, I felt sorry for a serial killer. Charlize Theron was astonishing as Aileen Wuornos, it was one of the greatest performances I've seen in years. Movies are a form of storytelling and this is a unique humanitarian way of telling story, of a notorious serial killer's life. Hats off to Patty Jenkins. Usually I like to watch serial killer movies which are made from the cop's point of view. Because I don't have any interest on how they become a monster, I don't like to travel their sick complex mind. Monster (2003) was an exception to that and what an exception, it was! The Aileen Wuornos's capture scenario could have been better. I've seen a couple of documentaries based on Aileen Wuornos real life. It was literary a tough-tense state of affairs for the police who caught her. Because she was angry, hopeless, broken and a ruthless killer. I guess the film misses this part's excitement. Anyway, for me, it is a recommended movie for all movie lovers of this genre.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Still difficult to watch, but what a performance","Though it's easy to wag fingers and tut tut about the wrongs and rights of today's society, at least Patty Jenkin's portrayal of Aileen Wuornos shows us, in difficult, often frighteningly graphic detail, what happened, when - and maybe why.We know the outcome, so, thankfully, we're spared all the legal court cases and all that. We're allowed, or offered to make up our own minds and ultimately, judgements. How many of us who might have witnessed that bad behaviour and then tut tutted and cursed 'society' and then gone back into our own world? Rarely, though, do we think of the causes, or the indeed, the outcomes of such. This film, at least for two hours redresses that.Incredibly well cast, Theron, obviously, but also Christine Ricci. She must have been considerably older than the innocent teen who gets sucked in by Wuornos, but who is brilliantly believable too. As the emotionally mixed-up, parent-pressured youth who just wants to break away and looks for any means in which to do just that. We all know of someone close to each of us who may have been in that vulnerable position.As for Charlize Theron, who, helped by big-brand beauty ads, is one of the most glamorous actresses in Hollywood. Breaking away from that 'bimbo' stereotype, maybe, but putting on the extra pounds, and a truly believable state of non- make-up, might have been just too risky for many of her A-lister colleagues.Though Wuornos, or the character portrayed as her by Theron seldom displays tenderness you certainly feel that wrath when the inner hatred explodes from within - and obviously outwards.I've yet to see the other biopic of the same woman 'Aileen - Life and Death of a Serial Killer' directed Nick Broomfield and released the same year. It's a documentary so wouldn't have the Oscar-winning performance but in a large way, I have no wish to. I'm glad that I've now experienced 'Monster' three times (when it's on UK TV) and it's still a love/hate thing. But I DO have a strong desire for watching fluffy, cute bunnies afterwards...",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Riveting portrayal of a despicable human (?) being,"Theron puts in an astonishing performance. If she had performed under an assumed name, probably no one would have recognized her.Several have commented that this portrayal was overly sympathetic to Wuornos, and some even felt that her background almost excused her murderous spree. I came away feeling nothing but disgust for her, and little sympathy even for the pathetic little wretch who went along for the ride, so I think the direction of this film was pretty even-handed if so many can take away different perspectives -- probably stemming from intellectual baggage we brought with us.For me, this film is just another example of why the death penalty serves a useful social purpose. There are some people so defective and so dangerous that, as they say in Texas, they ""need killin.""  It's too bad we couldn't have caught and killed this worthless bitch much sooner.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Monster Film!,"Come on Aileen! Why did you have to turn to a life of prostitution, which made you a habitual street midnight runner? Why did you not face your demons and get psychological help? And of course, why did you go on that killing spree? These monstrous questions are answered in the biographical film `Monster'. Monster is of course on the life of Aileen Wuornos. She was labeled by the media as the first American female serial killer. Wournos, a prostitute, killed 7 of her johns during the late 80's and early 90's in order to support her lesbian lover. Charlize Theron plays Wuornos in what has been described as one of the best transformation acting performances in cinematic history. Miss Theron, who gained 30 pounds for the role & had a wickedly scary Wuornos makeup alteration, is no Charlize Angel in this picture. Her mannerisms & gestures ,which copied those of the mentally disturbed Wuornos, were done with pitch-perfect accuracy. I mean that serialously, i mean seriously. Christina Ricci also executes an astounding performance as Wuornos' teenage lesbian lover. Monster's screenplay was also a monster ingredient in the film's success. There is dialogue in this film that is unforgettable and will be fixated in your cerebral cortex for days. First-time Writer/Director Patty Jenkins is deserving of newcomer accolades in a film that was challenging to direct and probably was not some type of pattycake project.

So touching a movie!,"Some lives do appear to be sad and wasted! Aileen Wuornous is an example of one of them. I have had a challenged life; but I have chosen never to kill anyone. I hurt for Aileen's trials (abandoned by her mom, molested as a minor) but I have to feel more sorry for the victims. This movie is said to have some fiction to it. Selby is fictional; but Wuornos' real life girl friend knew the more inside of things. Still I like the way it's portrayed. I like the way they showed her attempting to go straight. It did show that she wasn't realistic about it though. There are jobs she could have started off with (dishwasher, housekeeping in hotels are some examples). The movie showed that being a hooker was what she knew best. That part is sad but it's reality. I feel that Shelby was caught in the middle and had no choice in the end but to testify against Eileen.

Hopefully those who watch it can see more than just the ""evil"" side of Aileen.  While what she did for the most part is inexcusable, I find that this film does a good job of portraying both sides of her story.  You feel empathy for her at times, but you also don't forget the things she did. It gives you something to think about, or at least it did for me.

"A sympathetic view of a ""monster""","The buzz surrounding this film is that of Charlize Theron's physical transformation. However, perhaps people should be talking about her psychological transformation. Because even though she physically pulls off this performance, she nails it in the mentality aspect as well. The story chronicles the life of America's first celebrated serial killer. The focus tends to surround the events and tragedies that helped to transform her into one, instead of focusing on her actual crimes. I suppose law and order types will be upset about that, claiming it is a ""liberal"" movie that attempts to rationalize murder. It is true that the director does play a little fast and loose with the actual killer in question. However, I think the movie is justified. It is easy to say there are bad people out there that should be executed. But many of these people were not born that way. Tragedies beyond their control happen and their lives take on a very different and ugly path.

A Dark and Sad Portrait of Real Self-Destruction,"Charlize Theron does an intense, dark, and unbelievable transformation into Aileen Carol Wuornos, a highway prostitute turned serial killer.  It took me some time to acknowledge that Charlize Theron was the same person as the character that she was performing on the screen.  As Aileen, Theron turns in a performance that is quite possibly her best ever and will take considerable effort to surpass in the near future.  It's a role that explores the depths, physically and mentally, of her acting talents.  Her performance in this harrowing story is alone a reason to watch this movie.She plays a character that is so damaged, confused, and lost in her search for what I can only define as hope.  Her character has been scarred mentally and physically since childhood by parents, friends, and strangers.  This movie makes no excuses for what Wuornos, but does provides an account of her steps down the path the complete and utter ruin, from which she will not be able to return.  Theron's portrayal doesn't leave you thinking that this is a woman who didn't get what she deserved, but as a woman who could have been someone or something else if she had chosen differently.  The movie shows us that even in the worst of circumstances you may find hope.  Sadly, sometimes finding that hope may be too late.Christina Ricci is equally as compelling as Selby who is one of the catalysts for Wuornos transformation from highway hooker to highway killer. She is a simple person, filled with emotional and mental complexities that stem from a religious upbringing and dealing with the reality that she is a lesbian.  Two worlds that seemingly never seem to co-exist in harmony from what I can tell.  Selby isn't completely faultless either, but apparently is the weaker to the two women when it comes to have a spine, which we can only guess stems from the innuendo that her family life was one where women did what they were told, when they were told to do it.  The conclusion of the movie indicates that this may not be far from the truth.The movie is designed more to give insight to what happened to these two women in the brief period of time that their lives crossed.  It makes no attempt to vindicate either of the two women's actions.  The movie paints a painfully truthful picture of the darker side of this flawed world we live in, which many choose to ignore and deny even exists.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
