Nostalgic Sweet Spot,"It's hard to believe that this cult classic from 1995 is nearly three decades old. While elements of the film have stood the test of time (including one of the best film soundtracks to ever be made), there are bittersweet reminders here that the world that Empire Records depicts no longer exists. For those who were around in the 1990's, this often poignant movie will hit your nostalgic sweet spot, making you yearn for yesteryears. Yet, sentimentality aside, Empire Records presents a romanticized view of retail life as we once knew it. The fact the film takes place in a record store (which have sadly become extinct - for the most part) and only a few other locations are shown, the movie possesses a theatre-like charm. At times, you can't help but wonder if Empire Records should really be adapted for the stage (hey, there's a musical in there somewhere). The cast is attractive and clever, tossing witticisms left and right in a style reminiscent of Dorothy Parker. Everyone here has something smart or sassy to say. It's only when the film tries to go deep emotionally that things feel more maudlin than they need to. Fortunately, director Allan Moyle (there should be no surprise that he also directed two other cult favorites, Pump Up the Volume and Times Square among others) knows exactly when to lighten the mood with comedic bits that would fit in well on any sitcom of the era (hello, Friends). Some of the actors here went on to huge cinematic success, including Renee Zellweger in a fantastic early-in-her-career performance. On that note, we need her version of the song Sugar High to finally get the record release it deserves. Her performance of it (albeit it's less than two minutes on screen) is alone worth watching the film for. That and a look back at a time where young people had cool jobs in cool places and listened to really, really cool music - on vinyl, even.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"I do not regret the things I've done, but those I did not do.","Empire Records is directed by Allan Moyle and written by Carol Heikkinen. It stars, Anthony LaPaglia, Maxwell Caulfield, Debi Mazar, Johnny Whitworth, Liv Tyler, Renée Zellweger, Rory Cochrane, Robin Tunney & Ethan Embry. Plot centre's on one day at independent record store Empire Records. With the store under imminent threat of a take over by a corporate chain, this is no ordinary day. For on the day that the store will be visited by a fading pop star, they are forced to confront their personal issues, and maybe, just maybe, learn something about the people they work with.The film was a box office failure and was met with mostly negative reviews from the professional critics. Coming as it does from the director of critical/cult darling Pump Up the Volume, many were expecting a better and more hard edged picture than what they got. It also had to compete with certain 80's favourites brought to the cinematic world by John Hughes. While coming fast on the heels of the immensely popular Clerks (94) didn't help its cause either. Was it a case of bad timing? Is the film really just poor? And or, as mooted at the time: a career killer for those involved? Personally I think it's a film that needs revisiting now some 15 odd years after its release. In fact time has actually been kind to it and it now appears to have a good solid cult following. So unless you are judging it against the superior, record shop set, High Fidelity, you may find it's a film that's hard to dislike.Some of the complaints against it are fair, with the main one about it not having fully developed characters being as true as day is a day. While calling it one long stitched together music video has some substance when taking it at face value. Yet what is there is worthy of a second glance, they are interesting characters, and their respective hang-ups and pressures are evident enough for us to hang our hats on; even if it's set up to be accompanied by still more hipster indie rock music. There's also been much guff written about the film as regards calling it a teen angst film. Yes it is, but have these reviewers forgotten about the adults in the movie? LaPaglia's store owner, the father figure, trying to remain cool as his charges come under threat. Or Mazar, needing a wake up call from her job/career ignorance; and the big one, the delightful Caulfield (splendid bit of casting) as fading pop singer Rex Manning, imposter? Indeed. It's all relative as to why Empire Records deserves more than a once only viewing. As for the music, it does indeed rock, with each track carefully selected to be at one with the scene it accompanies. My favourite? AC/DC-If You Want Blood, a ball busting track for a vibrant and kicking scene.As for it being a career killing movie? The ladies of the piece have done rather well for themselves, Zellweger, Tunney and Tyler have made their marks in the industry, while Mazar has never been without work prior or post Empire Records. The guys haven't hit the heights of Zellweger and Tyler, which in the case of the excellent Rory Cochrane is not only a surprise, but also sad. Cochrane's Lucas is the key character and the glue in the middle of it all, always on hand with a dry quip or some philosophy, he's also supremely cool. Cochrane can be seen in serious mode leading 2006 thriller Right at Your Door. LaPaglia has always worked since 95, playing a number of different supporting characters, and Embry has appeared in big release's such as Vacancy and Eagle Eye. Caulfield has turned into the go to guy for TV shows and Whitworth, who quit acting for a while, pops up from time to time in minor roles such as in 3:10 To Yuma and The Rainmaker. So, not a career killer then.Stick it to the Man, Baby, Empire Records is a vibrant and funny movie. 7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Music
See it twice to appreciate it.....you'll be lukewarm the first time and love it the second time.,"I love this movie.  This movie is the kind of movie I watch movies for (um....did you follow that?).  I would make one suggestion, however....watch it twice before you decide if you like it or not.  If you're like me you'll probably be lukewarm the first time you see it but like it more each time you see it after that.The reason for seeing it twice is because the film's strong points become more evident the second (and beyond) time around.  Each character is well-defined, with individual traits and idiosynchracies, but this can be lost the first time through because you're trying to follow the story. There is a very strong soundtrack for the movie, but you appreciate it more the second time through, because you better understand how the music applies to the scene.  The actors have great chemistry and the character interactions are great.  The movie never takes itself very seriously and it's just a lot of fun to watch.  You'll find yourself rewinding it to see certain scenes again and again.I grant you the movie will never win any Academy nominations.  The plot is simplistic and the ""neat"" ending (all problems solved perfectly in just one day) is unrealistic (not that this bothered me....I personally loved the ending....if I want ""reality"" I'll watch the evening news).  Also, trying to follow the storyline tends to take away from the character interaction the first time you see it; hence, the suggestion to see it at least twice.  I actually didn't care for it the first time I saw it because I was looking at it strictly story-wise.  The second time I saw it I concentrated on the characters and the dialogue(which I loved), and that's when I realized the appeal.  If you're into serious movies that reflect real life and real suffering, you'll probably want to pass on this one.  However, if you watch movies to have fun and laugh, watch this one.  Also, if you like music- especially a moderately wide variety- you'll enjoy it.  It's worth your time, but save the beer for the second viewing.  ""Sugarhigh"" is awesome- Well done, Gina!  Hot voice....  Oh, and Damn the Man!  9 out of 10.",,Anonymous,Music
Empire Records — Mostly marginal kids working in a record shop as solace,"Empire Records is funny and slightly offbeat teen movie. A well built one, which each quirky character having a well defined personality, a set of problems, and realistic interactions with each other. Their personas all ring solidly true, each with deep emotional affects. However, not everybody will see themselves represented here, it is but a thin slice of society.The music is good, the dialogs are interesting just like the story, and it keeps an overall positive tone, although it does talk about some serious issues.

a good teen movie that shows how bad today's teen movies have gotten,"with the recent release of the special edition dvd of this film, i'd suggest you go watch it.  yeah, this movie is a light, fluffy gen-x teen movie with its music video moments.  however, what was eight years ago just a normal teen movie has gained some semblance of social relevance --  compared to today's teen movies, this film can be seen as some sort of masterpiece.for one thing, you never see films anymore where teens are actually fighting for something except for a date to the prom.  the characters in empire records, yes, are submerged in their overdramatic romantic escapades, but their main prerogative in the film is to prevent a large corporation from buying out their independent record store.  are there films that spark that kind of activist spirit in middle- and high- schoolers today?  no.  we're going backwards.also, the humor in this film offers up some absurdist wit, which you never find in teen movies now.  a kid glues some quarters to the floor so he can laugh at the poor saps who later try desperately to pick them up.  a shoplifting teenager gives the fake name of 'warren beatty'.  do kids today even know who warren beatty is?  i doubt it.this film was made in 1995, right before many of the laws allowing corporations to buy and control multiple media outlets were passed.  the years since '96 have shown us a homogenization of music and movies, especially in the teen sphere, and it is turning today's teens into a bunch of celebrity-obsessed idiots.compared to your sons and daughters, the kids in empire records can be now seen as role models.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
One Day in A Record Store With Those Kids...,"An employee steals the money from a record store's vault, with the hopes of gambling with it in Atlantic City and making it big. He fails, and the next day the store must face the reality: without the money, they will be turned into one of many chain stores where the more laid back approach to selling music just doesn't slide with those in charge. Also, this day features a visit from washed-up pop star Rex Manning.Directed by the writer and director of ""Pump Up The Volume"", this film simply is not as good as ""Pump Up The Volume"". And, sadly, it's also not the best movie about people hanging out in a record store -- ""High Fidelity"" is a better contender in that category. What this film does excel at is showing a store with way too many employees who do nothing (how can they possibly afford to pay these slackers) and really encapsulating what it was like to live circa 1995 (probably as much or even more so than ""Reality Bites"").That is really the only selling point for this film for me. Reminding me of 1995, when music like the Gin Blossoms was cool and people dressed like they were trying to escape the 1980s but didn't know how (and ended up turning to flannel for help). Sure, we have Robin Tunney (""The Craft"") and a young Liv Tyler... even Renee Zellweger. All fine actresses, but nothing worth seeing the film for if that's all you want to see.There's nothing new about the idea of trying to get a store saved from going under (or a school, or a radio station -- see ""UHF""). What makes this movie different is that the characters are just, well, weird. They sit around, don't do a lot of work, wander off for no reason, and nobody cares. The store could run more effectively with fewer employees, and the film would probably be tighter if one character was dropped (maybe Ethan Embry).Warren was by far the most entertaining part of the film for me. His hoodlum antics just made me very amused, and without him this would have been a highly dull film. Do I care about a girl's depression (which is never really explored or resolved) or another girl's acceptance to Harvard (which is barely covered) or a pill addiction (which is dealt with so minorly)? No. I am never given a reason to give half a fig. Each character is so shallow that their shallowness is almost deep in its presentation.If you need a flashback to 1995, this is a film for you. The music obviously plays a large role in this movie, and the styles will be familiar. But as far as being an outstanding film or a cultural achievement or even a cult classic, I guess I just don't see it. All the hype this film had or has circling around it don't amount to much. But, hype is like that -- almost never delivering on its promises.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Perfect...Well, not quite Perfect","For me, Empire Records is a very conflicting movie.  On the one hand, it's hysterically funny.  On the other hand, it attempts to make great revelations about America's youth.  Somehow, though, it all works!  Sure, there are some ""sappy"" predictable parts that you're not sure whether to laugh or cry at, but the timing of these scenes is fantastic.  One thing that really struck me about this film is the amazing use of music.  Certain songs can be heard repeatedly throughout the movie which really help to distinguish parallel story lines.  All in all, I think it's great.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"It's alright, nothing great","Soundtrack is pretty good, with a mix of early 90's rock/pop bands and classic rock. Nothing too unusual, but I can't say it's not good. The movie itself though, feels... contrived (yes I know all movies are artificial, but they shouldn't feel like it). Even within its own universe, it doesn't even make sense sometimes. For example, the owner is supposed to be (we are told) a big jerk, but he never does anything jerky and in fact is nice enough to let Joe run the store however he wants. It's obvious they wanted this to be the 90's version of a John Hughes movie, but it just doesn't really work. You could easily find worse than this, but you could also do better.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

One of my modern favorites.  Wait... THE favorite.,"This movie is awesome.  The best thing is the music.  Excellent.  It's the greatest collection of songs put into a movie.  Even better than Pulp Fiction.  There should be a BEST COMPILATION Oscar given to a music supervisor.  That's hard but in this kick-ass movie, it seems so effortless. The acting is also top-notch.  Renee Zellweger, Liv Tyler, Anthony LaPaglia, Robin Tunney, Johnny Whitworth, Max Caulfield, Debi Mazur, and Rory Cochrane, one of the coolest people alive.  The script is really good. Directing, also good.  Everything was pretty invisible, and I absolutely mean that in a positive way.  Just like in the old days, when it was invisible, they put you in the movie.  I felt like I was with these characters the whole way.  The new ""Remix!  Special Fan Edition"" is probably better.  I can't decide.  They're both superb.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Music
The Empire Strikes Back,"There are those who say that vinyl records are superior to digital recordings, that they possess an immediacy and authenticity. The hiss and the pops that come with vinyl are not imperfections to be overcome, they say, those are integral to the experience.This line of thinking has had a resurgence in recent years. Vinyl is back. And independent record stores are again in vogue, after the demise of most record chain stores.""Empire Records"" is about an independent store about to sell out to a chain. Its quirky group of employees are dedicated to music, especially on vinyl. They sing at work, they dance in the aisles, they have spirited discussions with customers about the music they are devoted to.Being young adults, they have their problems. This film explores their differences and their similarities. Like ""The Breakfast Club"" ten years earlier, it is a day's events that represent a coming of age.The cast is a fine group of young actors, including Renee Zellweger (very early in her career) and Liv Tyler (even before ""Stealing Beauty"").Appropriately, the soundtrack is packed with contemporary rock music. Some of it is excellent.The story is somewhat uneven and choppy, but it only seems to add to the authenticity of the film---like the imperfections of vinyl.The film was written by Carol Heikkinen, who also wrote the great dance film ""Center Stage"".",7.0,Anonymous,Music

still fun -- even though im not in junior high anymore,"i dunno. theres just something about this movie.yeh, in actuality, its probably dreck. its probably worthless and people probably wont remember its years and years from now when they start making out the lists of '90s movies that changed the sphere of moviemaking.so what?for me, this movie really does capture the feel of the mid-'90s. i was like these people once. i wore an outfit scarily like the one liv tyler sports (although without the hideous unders combo, im sure), i knew people like every one of the 'archetypes' from the movie and i really, really wanted to work in a record store. hasnt everybody? and doesnt everybody want there to be a cool record store like this in their town?i guess for me it is a nostalgia thing, but i watched it (again) the other night with my boyfriend, and we both still laughed during the funny parts and cuddled during the sweet parts and, well, danced during the dance parts.its just fun to look back on such a 'time-period' movie like that ... the clothes, the attitudes, the music even ... how good is it to hear the gin blossoms again, eh?im sure many would disagree, but for someone who was right there when it was all happening, so to say, its a gentle reminder of the days before mtv committed suicide, before liv tyler started making 'real' movies, and when phrases like 'whats with Today, today?' could travel through a junior high faster than mono.",,Anonymous,Music

A criminally underseen classic,"Initially when this film was released it flopped financially and critically. It has definitely built a deserved cult following over the years. It's one of my favorite go to make me feel great movies that explores a plethora of emotions making it similar to having the impact of the breakfast club and fitting perfectly in the wheelhouse of films that explore youth in a genuine way. This review is for both the Superior theatrical version and the interesting but flawed extended version. It centers on a group of employees whom deal with a variety of issues while working at a record store that's on the verge of closing. All the characters are quirky and wonderfully likable Renee Zellweger, Robin Tunney and Liv Tyler being the standouts. It's easy to see why the extended stuff was cut and the impact of some of the films best scenes are lessened including the amazing finale. I would highly reccomend just skipping the extended version and just sticking with the best cut. As it stands it's a love letter to the changing music scene as well as youth in general. Its hilarious fun and heartfelt and also stars Joe Mategna, Debi Mazar, Ethan Embry, Maxwell Caufield and so many more.Budget: $10m

"a hilarious, nostalgic and rocking trip down memory lane!","How did I miss this when It came out? Being that I used to search for movies of this type, I don't see how this gem slipped me by. I just watched saw it for the first time this week(after being inspired by many a glowing IMDb user comment!!) and found it be really terrific. The movie really affected me and watching it was an absolute trip. I want them to do a part two and I just saw part one! I guess I'm a little late in jumping on on the Empire Records train....This movie is a breath of fresh air. The characters are so relateable. And lovable. Joe is awesome! ""Warren Beaty"" steals every scene he's in. And it is just so much fun in general. The musical choices are great. The numerous one liners are Brilliant! Of Coarse I saw other movies I've loved reflected in this one (examples being ""The Breakfast Club"", ""Clerks"", etc). But I think this had it's own unique charm. It's such a good choice for anyone who's a music fan out there, as well as to anyone who's coming of age and just not really sure what they want and where their going. It's a little less talky then some of the other similar movies and it seems a celebration of freedom and rock-n-roll. I was also strongly reminded of ""High Fidelity"".Besides being hilarious, touching and nostalgic all at once, Empire Records also had another effect on me and that was making me want to call all my old buddies from that time period to yell at them to see this great movie....immediately. Unfortunately, I doubt many of them would be able to relate anymore.

One of the least essential movies of the 90s,"I really wasn't into this movie. It's been masquerading as it was a cultural touchstone for years, but the soundtrack is the only memorable bit. I like most of the actors in it, but I saw this as a largely wasted opportunity. A record store can totally be an interesting setting--check out ""Hi-Fidelity. This one here seems to think we should care about these kids' problems and struggles, but doesn't take any time for us to get to know them. I also find most of the characters unlikeable, and most of the situations are not interesting. But it keeps on going, like it's a tv show we've been watching for years, showing us the lives of these workers who we have no reason to want to watch.

Nineties essence,"Empire records is the last of a dying breed, the heart and soul of the place is held together by a tight knit group of young people who work there.

With a stricter business model the plan would turn the beautiful essence of the place on its head and become just another money greedy chain. With countless personal complications amongst the gang whilst trying like hell to raise enough money to keep the owner happy enough to keep the place independent it won't be easy. This is a last ditch effort for Empire Records to escape being swallowed whole by corporate greed.A absolute celebration of youthful optimism with a beautifully selected soundtrack that helps take you back.

Sadly, he produced this bouillabaisse.Even more maddening was the intertwining of sub-plots designed to lend credence to each character.

A Soon-to-be Cult Classic,This movie is the best ever about being a teenager in the nineties.  Every person under the age of 21 needs to see this film.,,Anonymous,Music
Has some cult status,"For the most part, I don't enjoy the current wave of teen films (such as the Scream series, though I am a horror fan), as they seem entirely too fake and cheesy (the only one I truly liked was 10 Things I Hate About You, basically because I like the entire cast). Where Empire Records did seem fake (the story line of an employee blowing $9000 of the store's money gambling and the boss deciding to pay it out of his own pocket is ridiculous), for some reason I found myself enjoying it quite a bit. I think the story in this film is quite a bit better than most in this crazed genre, and its one that keeps your attention. Why? I'm not quite sure. I think one of the reasons could possibly be that I have always wanted to have a job like that. I always wanted to work to be a fun place to go to, one that you did not mind going into day after day. In some ways, it reminded me of a job I once had, as my coworkers were great, and we considered our managers as friends, and we had fun at work while we actually got things accomplished, but not to the extent of fun these people had. 	The acting in this film is quite good, surprisingly. There is only one actor (the stoner) who I found to be quite unlaughably bad (so bad he's not even funny). Where most of the actors aren't overly known (Johnny Whitworth, Rory Cochrane), they do their parts convincingly, yet failed to make a name for themselves. I found both of those actors to be quite good, yet I'd never seen them in anything before. Other key players (Renee Zellweger and Liv Tyler) have become more `mainstream' after Empire Records. 	I'd been recommended this film several times since its release, and I never thought it seemed interesting enough to sit down and watch it. I'm certainly glad I saw it, however. I believe the film has a certain rewatchability that I look for in films (that so many films lack). 	Though I don't think this film would be considered cult just yet, it certainly will gain that status some day along with the dozens of other teen movies in the genre. In another ten years or so, people will look back upon these films and undoubtedly laugh at them the way we now laugh at films from the 1980s. I am not a fan of this genre mainly because I find it quite ridiculous that they portray `teens' (however, most of the time the actors portraying these teens are actually in their 20s, which is another thing that bothers me) acting the way they do. It's even more disturbing to see some idiotic people follow the lead of these `teens' and act like this in real life, which I see more and more, and tend to avoid people like this. I do think that when looking back on this genre after 20 years that this film will be considered one of the better ones. 	Where I wouldn't recommend this film to everyone, I would have to recommend it to certain types of people.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Great movie, a sign of it's time","I love this movie very much. I don't own a lot of movies but this is one that I do. Like any film, it has it's problems but in general it is great. The film was well casted, each actor fit and made the best of his or her role. Maxwell Caulfield played Rex Manning, the character you love to hate. Anthony LaPaglia played Joe who was one of the best managers that you could work for. The actor's attitude toward his role was very well displayed. Rory Cochrane played Lucas, who is my favorite character in this movie. Then there is Johnny Whitworth, now everybody sort of disinclueds him or doesn't like him but I think that he did a good job as AJ, I could not see anyone else there, maybe someone could have done a better job but he did well. The rest of the cast was fantastic. The plot of the film was a little non existent, it's more like a series of events that just go one after the other with no really flow.

90's Teen Individuality at it's best!,"The 90's were one of the best times to grow up, and this shows it when you have good friends and plenty of pop culture references in that time period, such as Super NES (my signature console), Axl Rose, CD's, VHS, Crop tops, grunge looks, long hair, I could go on and on. Teen life in that time period couldn't be any better, even things get glum, things can somehow get better in one way or another. You could see yourself in at least one of the characters in the movie, AJ the lovestruck art student nice guy who struggles with expressing himself, Corey the sweet though shy overachiever (love her look), Mark the quirky comic who often acts up, Lucas the rebel who means well but messes up, Debra the ultimate introvert tired of being invisible, and Joe the caring but sometimes overbearing boss who acts more like a father to the teens. As the group struggles to maintain their store, they're also trying to maintain their individuality as well and not succumb to conformity that society expects them to be. Without revealing everything this will make you both laugh and cry plus discover yourself, especially to a great ending that will make you want to see it again and again. This deserves more respect and recognition.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Worst 'alternative' teen flick evaaaaaaaaaaar,"This was appalling, seriously, who wrote and directed this sham of a film; Sixth form students on a ketamine come-down? It hangs together like a shoddy patchwork quilt.The characters are utterly 1 dimensional and unbelievable, it is impossible to care for any of them for even one second. I wanted to pulverise Lucas' smug face until it was just Pate in a skull shaped bowl. Ug, it makes me sick just thinking back about it to review it.Gwar are on screen for a couple of seconds which is good, but even they are tarnished by this cinematic turd.Whichever cynical film company put together this mockery of alternative teen life should feel ashamed and should probably be taken outside and shot.",1.0,Anonymous,Music

Great movie!,"I had heard a lot about this movie, that it was one of those really great but under-appreciated 90's movies, so I decided to watch it. It is now one of my favorite movies and I'm really glad that I saw it. Every actor does a great job - they make you feel like you've known them forever and you really go through the troubles that they are going through. I especially liked Ethan Embry as Mark and Johnny Whitworth as A.J. I was really surprised with how well Liv Tyler acted the part. The characters themselves are really relate able, and made me want to work at that store so badly. Also, it had one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard. I loved how they incorporated the music into each scene - it was part of what was going on, not just background noise. Overall, this was a really great movie - ***** out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Not On Rex Manning Day,"Empire Records is a 1995 coming of age comedy drama about a group of record store employees who deal with multiple issues over the course of one long day. It's a very character driven movie, with a big cast and a lot of dialogue. I love this movie, but aside from the beginning and a brief chase scene, the whole movie is just a bunch of people in a record store so if you're not into smaller settings it might not be for you.The cast is awesome and does an amazing job, The writing is great with several little stories being told in one big story, and the movie as a whole brings back a lot of 90's nostalgia.

crazy wild fun,"A group of young people work at the independent Empire Records. While closing up, Lucas (Rory Cochrane) discovers a contract in manager Joe Reaves (Anthony LaPaglia)'s office to sell out the store to big corporate Music Town. Lucas tries his luck with the store's cash to save the place and promptly loses $9k in Atlantic City. The next morning, A.J. (Johnny Whitworth) and Mark (Ethan Embry) are the first at the store. Corey Mason (Liv Tyler) and flirty friend Gina (Renée Zellweger) have a crush on 80's pop star Rex Manning (Maxwell Caulfield) who is coming to the store. His time is mostly pass and even his assistant Jane (Debi Mazar) doesn't like his music. Angry Deb (Robin Tunney) shaves her head. A.J. vows to reveal his love for Corey. They catch a young shoplifter who claims to be Warren Beatty. It's going to be a crazy day.This is a crazy wild mess of young people fun. The music is loud and mostly good. The story is full of teen angst. The best is the cast of great young up and comers. Tyler and Zellweger are in short skirts. Tunney actually shaves her hair. It's lots of teen melodramatic fun. The characters are appealing. It's certainly possible to be get-off-my-lawn on this movie but not me. Even a bad sleazy Maxwell Caulfield can't get me out of this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

"Good Performances, Great soundtrack, Thin Plot, Good Movie","Empire Records is arguably the closest the 90s came to channeling one of those memorable 80s teen ensembles like the Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles or Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Occurring almost entirely within the confines of an independent music store and utilizing some then fairly unknown, but quality, young actors like Liv Tyler, Renee Zellweger, Ethan Embry, Rory Cochrane, Johnny Whitworth, and Robin Tunney with an excellent older cast Maxwell Caulfield, Anthony Lapaglia and Debi Lazar.Lapaglia stars as Joe Reaves, the manager of Empire Records, an independent music store facing hard times and on the verge of selling out to the Music Town franchise thanks to the evil owner Mitchell Beck (Ben Bode). For many of Reaves teenage staff, Empire Records is their last chance saloon. On the day after Lucas (Cochrane) in a last ditch attempt to save the store, steals all of the money from the store safe and loses it at a casino, Reaves tells his employees about the impending sale. With a past his prime 80s rock star Rex Manning (Caulfield, brilliant) visiting the shop to sign autographs the confused staff work through their various issues and try to come to terms with the coming change.The film has an excellent soundtrack and some great comedy scenes. LaPaglia is excellent and he is ably supported by the minor players. Cochrane's Lucas and Tunney's Debra being the standouts. Though Whitmore and Tyler do their best to drag proceedings down with a fairly unremarkable love story. This was a much loved film among teen audiences when it came out in 1995, and many years on, while dated, still stands up. It goes a little more deeply into some significant issues faced by the characters, without getting bogged down by them, though it does offer some too easy solutions.In the end if you take good performances, a great soundtrack, and an basic plot, you get a good movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
like a master class in how not to make a movie,"This shaggy, somewhat annoying movie has inexplicably gone on to be some sort of cult class, and yet I can find little of worth in it outside of a good cast and a decent soundtrack.The movie takes place in a record store and is about ... not much of anything. It begins with a character doing something dumb (and criminal) and going on to spout non-sequitors and just being the most annoying character in the movie.Most of the movie is made up of characters arguing, acting stupid, dancing in the aisles, and trying to figure out who they're going to sleep with. There's a problem that bubbles up at the beginning but then it just simmers until it inexplicably takes over in the last 15 minutes, when it is resolved as absurdly as possible.I don't have much fondness for teenagers being dumb, which is what this whole movie is. The female half of the cast is somewhat appealing (or maybe just hot) and the male side is middling to annoying.So basically someone said, let's make something episodic like American Graffiti but all on one set and then let's tie it together with a dumb ending. And this is the result.Not recommended.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Slice of life in a music store.,"As one critic bluntly says, in one day everything that can possibly happen to the characters does, and everyone comes out better at the end. Truly this doesn't happen in real life, but in REEL life we call it entertainment. I enjoyed it as a quirky comedy. I probably would not have been so entertained if it didn't have some of my favorite stars, some before they hit it big -- Renee Zellweger, Liv Tyler, Debi Mazar, and Anthony LaPaglia. I was not familiar with Rory Cochrane, but his character Lucas was one of the best here.So, what's the story? LaPaglia is the manager of this Eastern US record store, Empire Records which has been in business since 1959, the sign tells us. On this fateful day employee Lucas is asked to close the store at midnight, and count all the money, twice. He does, and also observes that plans are in place to sell the business and convert it into a rather dull record store. So, he does what any good employee would do. Instead of putting the $9Thousand in the safe, he gets on his motorcycle and heads to Atlantic City with it! That begins a rather hectic 24 hours, involving all the employees of Empire Records.Nothing Earth-shaking, just a fun movie to watch.May 2020 edit: I watched it again and came away with much the same opinions. I found it especially interesting to see Zellweger right before she started her climb with the role in Jerry Maguire a year later. And now she is a fresh Oscar winner, Best Actress as Judy Garland. You can see that she was always exceptional.",,Anonymous,Music

How this became my favorite movie ever...,"Way back in 1997, at the young age of 17, I wandered into my local Hollywood Video store with the family, looking for a comedy to get me through the night.At the time, I had been trying to get a job at one of the music shops in the mall (for the record, I never got one there). So when I stumbled upon this movie I had never heard of I thought it might be worth the $1.99 I'd pay for it. So I take it home and it became a favorite, but not my favorite.Fast forward to a year later and I decide to move from Virginia to Alabama to be with my girlfriend who I met online. That weekend after moving my stuff into her apartment all we wanted to do was cuddle (as we haven't seen each other in months). We decided to watch a couple of movies. I started digging in my movies and she started digging in hers. We turned to each other and low and behold, we both were holding our copies of Empire Records. It was pretty hilarious at the time and the taste in movies sealed the deal on our relationship... We've been together nine years next month and have a four year old daughter together.But the love for 'Empire' doesn't end there.After moving to Alabama, I got a job at a movie theater. One of my co-workers there also held a second job at a movie rental store. He is the master of movie knowledge and he became one of my best friends. One day I started telling him about this movie. He had never even heard of it (this was in 2001 mind you). He said he wanted to see it so I brought it over and we watched it. He instantly named it his favorite movie of all time.From that point forward, we couldn't work together a day without cracking jokes by referencing lines from this movie. Every day, at that place, was Rex Manning Day!",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Pretty good performances by Anthony LaPaglia, Debi Mazar in a small role, Robin Tunney, and especially Renee Zellweger. The direction was suitably unobjectionable.

I started to see a bit more of the humans beneath these initially shallow characters. It's only deep in a Breakfast Club kind of way, so don't expect a deep study on the human condition. If you can't stomach the characters, you haven't missed very much.

Was this an attempt to be the 90's version of Fast Times at Ridgemont High? I see some similar characters, but these actors can't act, and they don't have much to do in the movie except behave like dumb shallow teenagers.

A Nutshell Review: Empire Records Remix! Special Fan Edition (1995),"This quirky take with memorable characters take place in a span of 24 hours in a record store known as Empire Records (Tower Records anyone?) It highlights a day in the life of the store employees, made up of teeny boppers like proverb spewing Lucas (Rory Cochrane), suicidal rebel Jane (Debi Mazar), slutty Gina (Renee Zellweger), smarty pants Corey (Liv Tyler), amongst others.The story starts off with Lucas taking nine thousand dollars from the cashier at night before he closes the store, and loses it all in a hilarious sequence at Atlantic City. Joe, the co-owner, learns about this, and the recovery of this amount of money forms the running theme in this movie.Thrown into the plot is an equally hilarious character Rex Manning, a has-been singer who's due at the store for an autograph session with his fans. You'll definitely dig one of his cheesy music videos. Corey has a crush on Rex, and tries to seduce him, but falls flat in embarrassment. Of course she's shocked when good friend Gina manages to pull the seduction off, and me-ow, a catfight ensues.As if the day isn't bogged down with too much activities in serving customers and spinning good music in the store, the employees learn that their beloved Empire Records will be absorbed by Music Town, a larger competitor. Therefore it's also a race against time to preserve the identity of their store.But it's a feel good movie, with feel good songs sprinkled with the occasional metal, so the ending is somewhat predictable with all threads and sub plots merging into one grand finale. Needless to mention, my primary objective is actually to watch Liv and Renee in one of their earlier movies :-)",7.0,Anonymous,Music
I've seen better,"Alright, I just finished watching this movie for the first time because a couple of my friends highly recommended it to me, saying it was by far their favorite movie. So, when my other friend bought it, i headed on over in anticipation, only to be disappointed by its bland and played out plot, little and sporadic humor, and lack of character development. Also, a few characters really annoyed the crap out of me like Mark and Corey. Mark is possibly the most annoying character I've ever seen or at least in the top 5 or 10. I also wanted to strangle Cory, Liv Tyler's character, at times, especially with her psychotic bipolar disorder shown a few times in the movie. I dunno I just felt like the end couldn't have come at a better time. In spite of these problems, I did enjoy Joe and most of the other character's however.

Over-budgeted Clerks,"This movie is pretty bad, let's start off with that.This movie takes everything that Clerks was (is), or at least the concept, and changes it into an over-budgeted, unoriginal, thoughtless beast of a movie.  People who see it after about 1996 won't like it due to the fact that most of the music in the movie A)  Is terrible and B) has disappeared with the rest of the crap that was in the mid-90s music genre.Many problems go unresolved in this movie, dialogue is forced, and everything is very unimaginable.

Thin plot, dumb dialogue, no character development. Attempts at humor are lame, attempts at drama are laughable. Strictly for the Renee Zellweger or Liv Tyler completist.

surprising,"It's closing time at empire records. Lucas has close and he is anxious about it being but with this responsibility; but then he does something wrong. He takes off with nine thousand dollars to Atlantic City and loses it in one grand gesture on the craps table. The next day he comes to realise his mistake; but he's not the only one with problems today at empire records. Through this one day we meet the rest of the employees and one day they wont forget in a long time.Today is Rex Manning day; Rex is making an appearance for signings. Corey loves Rex; she's loved him since she was a child and wants to offer herself to him. A.J though loves Corey, but cant decide whether to go to art school or not. Debra is the black sheep and is suicidal, but she wont let anyone get close to her for anyone to help. The rest of the employees are some of the craziest people; it would be awesome to work at empire records.This was such a surprise watch. It doesn't really try to be anything prolific about teen life; instead is a honest comedy about a group of odd characters trying to set their lives on course. The jokes are perfectly timed; just before it seems to drop the ball and go flat, it quickly catches it and your attention is brought back. This does towards the end dive deep into the sentimentality, but it fits perfectly and it works to its advantage. Its also great to see a lot of actors at the beginning of their career before they became big. Renee Zellweger, Liv Tyler and Anthony LaPaglia give good honest performances, and Robin Tunney is great as the misunderstood Debra. All the performances are actually good, everyone gave their character an honest and unique personality, they seemed like real people and you could identify and relate to them.Empire Records comes from the left field and delivers a great comedy of teenage life.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Wow--This movie has certainly become dated,"I remember when this came out--it was 1995 and I had just graduated high school and was entering university. Everyone I spoke to who had seen this movie at that time really liked it, but I thought it looked totally lame, so I never saw it.Fast forward to last night, when I did! Owch! It was so bad. Worst of all, the music, the clothes, all that stuff--I wore the little minis, the belly shirts, the big boots, dated boys with skater haircuts--now I know how my mom felt when she looked back into the '70's and realized that the Farrah Fawcett hair and big owl glasses were not the height of style.Plus the plot on this movie was weak, weak, weak. If there EVER was a place where people could work and this kind of adolescent s**t went on, even in the mid-nineties, I would guarantee they would get fired. What kind of manager puts up with this drama? And to have an employee have sex with a guest in a closet AT WORK? Classy! Dancing with your shirt off in the aisles? Woo-hoo! Sounds professional to me! Why not shave your head at work before your shift--and leave all your hair in the sink? Yay!But I guess I perhaps missed seeing this in the window where it might have been relevant to me. I hope that teenagers today realize that someday they are going to look back someday and see just how silly their fashions (hello 80's new wave! Wait--there's nothing new about it) will look with 12 years distance. This movie takes whatever coolness that existed in the time period and encapsulates it into a sitcom-esquire music video. So I do have to say, Booo.On a horrible note, this movie brought home the fact that Renee Zellweger has NEVER BEEN YOUNG. Liv Tyler and I are the same age (29) and I don't think that she looks much different, which is a good thing. Renee Zellweger looks like a less pruney version of herself, but definitely not a teenager!Don't waste your time on this crap!

Time Capsule,"Once upon a time there was this magical place called ""the record store."" It was a place that appeared for many generations following World War II. A place that had a vivid spot in American culture, especially American teenage culture, before we even walked on the moon.I for one still have cherished memories of piling into a car with my friends, taking the trip out to Tower Records, only to get publicly castrated by the super-hot chick with the pierced nose that worked behind the counter because I brought a copy of the ""The Book of Secrets"" for my girlfriend.She forced me to turn around, hold the album high, and announce to the entire store that I was buying Loreena McKennitt.It was one of the most humiliating moments in my high school career...And you just don't get that level of quality service at Best Buy...let alone Itunes. So occasionally you took a shot in the face for your girlfriend's bad taste...but you also did it in an environment where you were talked into buying Getz and Jobim and a complete collection of Bossa Nova, just because one of the clerks caught you walking through the Jazz section.""Empire Records"" is just like that, it's a time testament to childhood. It's your youth wrapped up into a feature film. It may be a flawed movie, from time to time, but the jokes are there and they are funny. The people that you used to know are all there too.I can't remember what the hot clerk that made me do the Mummers Dance looked like, but in my minds eye now she looks just like Robin Tunney. James 'Kimo' Wills was the stoner clerk that took me from Pearl Jam to Coltrane in one shopping trip...and if you are out there, whoever did that for me...thank you.Maybe you were never lucky enough to get a job at the record store, but you still knew some of the clerks very well. You spent your hard earned money there and you can never go home again.You can never REALLY go home again. Maybe you can head to Rolling Stone, but the staff there are all Millennials and most of their knowledge stops no later than 2006. They are polite to the customers, not surly and hysterical. The Record Stores of today are an empty shell of their former glory...But you can still watch ""Empire Records"" you can still go back in time to the day BEFORE the music died...well, before it died again, and, for a little while, pretend you are still living in that time and place where music was played on instruments and people sang without auto-tune.The movie is like the baseball diamond in ""Field of Dreams""...only for audiophiles. What makes it great is that sense of peace in the universe.For Gen-X to Baby Boomers ""Empire Records"" reminds us that we were there, and alive, in that little corner of time. Now, twenty-years back, we can watch it with all the warm, glowing, nostalgia it deserves.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Perhaps one of the most pointless films ever.,"I can not believe this made it to film.  Truly a disgusting piece of work. It was colorful, it was poorly acted, it was pointless, and the entire plot was something like a joke.  The only reason to see it might be Renee Zellweger, but even THAT is a stretch.  Highly unrecommended.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
A movie about what retail is REALLY like..,"I worked for a record store chain when I first saw this movie and there wasn't one person who worked at the store that didn't agree that it was one of the funniest, and sadly, most accurate movies ever made.The movie succeeds on so many levels, it's just too hard to describe. I found myself identifying with every single character in some way, and Empire made it easy to laugh at the true insanity of what people who work retail go through: obnoxious customers, bosses that are cool, higher ups that suck, etc.The movie made me a lifelong fan of Coyote Shivers' music (check out his CD if you haven't already -- it's a scream) and many of the talented players, but especially Ethan (Randall) Embry and Kimo Wills.Highly recommended by this ex-record store clerk!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
I'd rather shoot my head off than watch this again.,"I first saw this movie when I was in junior high. I hated it. Then I kept hearing in high school by all of the drama and band geeks that it was so great. So, I decided to give it another chance, to see if my tastes had changed or if I had overlooked something. I guess not. I hated this movie the first time, and I hated it the second time. It is so fake and so obnoxious with these characters who are all a bunch of dumb asses. I have no idea what anyone sees in this movie. Liv Tyler was god awful (as usual), playing a virgin who is really a slutty bimbo. Renee Zellwegger is god awful (as usual), playing a real slutty bimbo. All of the other actors are terrible as well. It's like MTV. All fluff and no substance.

There is No Dog in this Movie,"There are some films that may not be perfect, but have just the right amount of charm and nostalgic value that you can't help but enjoy them. Empire Records is not one of those films. I know some people have a soft spot for this one, but not me. Empire Records is one of the most abysmally annoying films I've ever seen in my life. There is no character, no charm, no originality, no effort! It all feels like one long, poorly edited music video with a sloppy screenplay attached at the last minute. Speaking of which, this movie is written terribly! There is a point when one character commits a federal crime, which would normally result in a prison sentence, and the action is brushed off like nothing! In fact, there are multiple scenes just like this. The film also has the dignity to take difficult subject matter such as drugs, depression, and even suicide, and just brush them off in its own idiotic way before returning to more quick editing, loud music, and screaming teenagers. I want to say Empire Records is so bad it's good, but that would require actual enjoyment from the film. As far as that goes, I received none. Other than all that, I would reccomed seeing this film if you're catatonic.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
A great movie with a now-famous cast that was young at the time,"I was impressed with Moyle's comedy about young teens helping their boss (Lapaglia) save his record store from turning into a chain ""MusicTown"" (barbershop sort of stole this theme). After seeing this film, I'm enthusiastic to watch Pump up the volume. The film sets out and achieves everything it attempts to achieve. A very funny film, with a great atmosphere, nice dialogues, and a very talented young cast. The screenplay was very well written, with some very cool dialogues. La Paglia was good in his role, however the best performances in the film came from Renee Zellweger, Rory Cochrane and a very hilarious Brendan Sexton. Liv Tyler was also good, as were Embry and Whitworth. I actually enjoyed this film a lot, contrary to the people I saw it with, who said they bored (this is typical of them however because they wanted to watch a Jackie chan movie, lol) A very funny, unorthodox teen movie, 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Music

A committee of marketing executives and corporate lawyers fabricated a script using the latest in writing based computational programs. This script was not written, no ink touched flesh nor flesh touched paper, no intimacy, a program is initiated in the Script-motron 500 and in mere minutes Empire Records screenplay was drafted.

One of my all time favorites!,"Empire Records is a hilarious and moving look into the lives of a group of teenagers during one day at the independent record store where they work. Though they may be very different, they all have the common bond of simply loving music. There's all types of personalities in this wonderful cast: the straight-A perfectionist with more than a few secrets (Liv Tyler), the slut who only acts the way she does to cover up her insecurities (Renee Zellweger), the lovably funny and hyperactive punk-rock kid who dreams of being in his own band (Ethan Embry), the misunderstood suicidal goth whose self-destructive ways only make you like her more (Debi Mazar), the wise father-figure *though he's still their age* who has made his own share of mistakes that have a cost (Rory Cochrane), and finally the hopeless romantic who obsesses over the people he cares about (Johnny Whitworth). This is wildly entertaining, a little bit weird, but overall a great look into 1990's culture. The whole cast is great, but standouts are Ethan Embry and Rory Cochrane who steal the scenes they are in. Also the soundtrack is awesome.

They all have their strengths and weaknesses, and good points and bad points. It seemed a lot more realistic than how most teen movies are where there is one really bland main character and then he or she has its quirky stereotypical friends.

One of the three worst movies I've ever seen,"One of the three worst movies I have ever seen, right there with ""Pushing Tin"" and ""Batman and Robin."" The completely unbelievable, highly annoying, and one-dimensional characters in this movie were the victims of some of the worst character development I have ever seen.

It was one of those movies I would have thought was cool in 8th grade, when I had no idea what a good movie, or even reality for that matter, was like.

Pretty Disappointing,"I guess I was expecting too much, based on the number of stellar actors who are in this film. Instead of an impressive product of the late nineties it struck me more as a high school student's attempt at their first movie. The script is ridiculous and the characters are mere stereotypes of what you'd expect from a film aimed at teenagers, but even less developed than that! The only positive ingredient of this shambles is the music that was included. It's a wide span of artists and music styles but somehow manages to be much more entertaining than what's actually happening on screen. It's also lovely to see Liv Tyler and Renee Zellweger in such early roles but their talents are pretty much wasted here. Another reviewer suggested watching it more than once to fully appreciate its value but I just can't stomach sitting through it again. I would imagine the only real audience for re-watching this would be someone who saw it when it came out in 1995 and were about 13 years old at the time.

It is also quite entertaining to see Liv Tyler flip out after being criticized for a speed addiction, (generally not one of Liv Tyler's roles) and the character of ""Lucas"" is hilarious with his insightful views.

I, as does everyone else, knows it's no Oscar material; but it never tried to make it self be that, so stop making it out to be and ripping it apart! It's brilliantly acted-probably one of the best casts ever-coordinated, greatly directed, and the script is clever, witty, AND original regardless of what non-movie buffs claim. What other film can get tarnished on a select theater run and then come back to acquire millions, even maybe a billion fans on video; bringing it towards cult status! Anything that includes Zellweger, Tunney, Tyler, Whitworth, Cochrane, and Embry in the same movie gets a thumbs up in my opinion. I only hope that someday there will be something along the lines of an E! True Hollywood story made for this film...they did it for Clueless! So what it all boils down to is that this film is a work of art-sorry, no killing people, massive sex, or violence-it actually relies on the acting and story.

Yuck,"I was excited to see Empire Records for the first time a few years ago. I had several friends and acquaintances who raved about it and I was more than impressed to see Toad the Wet Sprocket and Gin Blossoms on the soundtrack. Talk about being disappointed. This is a dull film with little merit beyond the obvious appeal of its idle fantasy. ""We're young and we have problems but we stick together and straighten ourselves out with a party"" seems to be the single puerile point this movie drives for.The characters are almost without exception completely unlikable and poorly developed (although the bald girl is rather cool). One character blows all the record store's money at the beginning of the film, no reason given. Liv Tyler wants to sleep with her aging pop idol and elicits no sympathy. Zellweger actually does sleep with him and elicits even less. I wanted to slap them both. The artist with the coins in the floor is in love with Liv but I just wished he would see how impossibly stupid she was and date someone else. Maybe the bald girl, since she was the film's single redeeming character (and that's not saying much).Worst of all is the erratic, potentially mentally ill manager played by Anthony LaPaglia. This is by no means a criticism of fine actor Anthony, but his character is appallingly written, shifting from nurturing and understanding father figure to angry and psychotic manager type between - and even within - scenes. Nothing about the film feels consistent or worth caring about.If you want to watch a good film about music try High Fidelity or Almost Famous, where the characters are actually entertaining and well written and the stories not the stuff of ridiculous adolescent fantasy.",3.0,Anonymous,Music

I can't even begin to describe what is wrong with it - it was just a meaningless mess.  I know some idiot is going to say ""that is the point... it's a slacker film"".

The Time to Hesitate is Through,"Trying to contribute something useful to prospective viewers means trying to explain the extremely polarized nature of the comments about ""Empire Records"". An uninitiated reader would think that the love-it and hate-it groups were talking about two different films. Which is actually a relatively accurate take on the situation. Allan Moyle's films may differ in subject and structure, but they all have the same indefinable quality that literally connects them to a segment of viewers. This is not the same thing as ""getting it"" which you would use explain the positive/negative reactions to ""Dr. Strangelove"", ""Nashville"", or ""Clockwork Orange"".The connection process is more subtle, and it doesn't seem to matter whether you are watching ""Times Square"", ""Pump Up the Volume"", ""New Waterford Girl"", or ""Empire Records"". An earlier comment came close to capturing this quality: "".....watched it (again) the other night with my boyfriend, and we both still laughed during the funny parts and cuddled during the sweet parts and, well, danced during the dance parts....."". The point being that if you have ever connected with a Moyle film you will most likely connect with ""Empire Records"" and will see an entirely different film that those not so lucky.What about those with no prior exposure to Moyle? Think of ""Empire Records"" as the ""American Graffiti"" of the 90's, a similar ""one-day"" structure and a cast of relatively unknown young actors destined to make it big. Structurally it's a microcosm movie like ""The Big Chill"", as almost all the action takes place in the same location and the day being portrayed is not a routine one but an extraordinary one (it's Rex Manning day). Not all fans of ""Ghost World"" and ""Can't Hardly Wait"" will enjoy ""Empire Records"" but it is probably safe to say that if you hated those two films you should avoid ""Empire Records"".It has a happy ending with characters you like and identify with, and the small world of the record store functions as family and universe for these characters. There are lots of little things that you only pick up on after repeated viewings. I'm convinced that the over-the-top stuff works (i.e doesn't come across as totally lame) because Moyle and his editor have carefully set things up on a subconscious level. For example when Corey is agonizing about opening her Harvard admissions letter, they cut between her and attentive shots of both AJ and Gina, who are standing near her to be supportive despite having mixed feelings about her going away. They are the two people who care the most about her. Which furnishes the viewer with the information to understand the nature of her meltdown later in the film, she comes unglued not about Rex Manning but with the sudden realization that her preoccupation with herself has alienated the two people she cares about the most.My favorite sequence is when Joe tracks down Deb (Robin Tunney) who has retreated from everyone and is sitting on the floor of one of the listening booths doing the store's tax return, symbolic of the protective niche she has found working in the store for Joe. In an extremely touching scene Joe finally just tells her that she is doing a good job. Tunney nicely underplays her character's gentle sarcasm during their exchange, but there is a huge dimensionality in her responses that perfectly communicates her connection to Joe and the store. So that in about 30 seconds Moyle has set up a believable explanation for the sacrifice Deb will later make to help save them.My second favorite sequence is a montage of activity inside the store early in the film. While the soundtrack plays Dire Straits' ""Romeo and Juliet"", the editor cuts between characters, coming back to ""Juliet"" Mills' daughter each time the Juliet lyric is sung.Plus there is a nice bit of irony as the film opens with a customer asking a question which sets all the events in motion: ""Do you think the story is already written or do you think a bold courageous act can change the course of history?"". The irony being that the bold act changes the course of history in a totally unintended manner.The ending is a mix of the ""Times Square's"" ending and something out of a Judy Garland- Mickey Rooney movie where they get the gang together and put on a show.""Empire Records"" has no obvious technical problems and Moyle gets very even performances out of his relatively inexperienced cast. The soundtrack is the most diverse and extensive you are likely to encounter.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
all praise,"this film is great, and like few others i have ever seen. if you can find it (these days in the UK HMV has exclusive VHS rights) i urge you to buy it. it's not expensive and is very funny indeed.

"Someone read this script and said "" Yea I'll give you money to make this"".","There is truly nothing I love more in this world than laughing at something that is intended to be dramatic. That is what a majority of the so called ""dramatic"" scenes did for me. This movie is intended to be a comedy with dramatic elements. I love when the drama becomes the comedy. One of my favorite touches in these kind of movies are characters like Tyler's who are going to Harvard, and the pretty boy who is secretly an amazing artist, and don't forget the slutty girl with the heart of gold. The suicide girl's character I believe was in every movie of the 90's dealing with teenagers. There is a reveal of Liv Tyler's character's speed addiction which leads to a big falling out between members of the store; this was intended to be dramatic. When the scene unfolded I found myself laughing as hard as I did when I saw Woody Allen's Bananas for the first time. This movie is very very very bad. If your in the mood for escapism than this is the movie for you or if you're dumb.Also there is this scene where Liv Tyler yells at the boss in order to be the one who gives lunch to the 70's lowlife; her yell reminded me of the bad acting of Mischa Barton's yell on the O.C. very uncomfortable.If you like this movie I hope that you're not an adult, if you're not you may still have a chance to be aware of what is good and what is bad. This movie was bad.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Something for everyone,"Well, first of all, Empire Records reminded me of Seinfeld in the way that it's plotlines are very deep and inter-related.  Every character interacts with the others at one point in the movie.  In the end, every single loose end is tied up and the audience is left feeling satisfied.Another main attraction to this movie is the music.  There are tons of songs in the movie, each one is well placed and important.  The music practically pulls the story along at times.  Overall, the movie was well edited, well scored, and well acted.  Everything was great, and everyone will love it.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Weird movie that Didn't age well,"Really the only good things i can say about this movie is getting to see Renee zellweger, Liv Tyler and Robin Tunney when they were really hot while also unknown at the time. The soundtrack is good but the characters are cardboard cut outs and the movie doesn't make much sense to modern eyes. Even in the nineties it's really hard to believe a record store like that could have stayed in business when the employees are shown spending more time goofing off than selling records to customers. It is a cringey mess of a movie, not even nostalgia can save it. The whole let's save our beloved record store narrative was put well onto the backburner to prioritize all the more ridiculous stuff that didn't make the characters relatable or even likable.",2.0,Anonymous,Music

But since this movie wants to be a comedy with some drama parts I can only advise to never watch it.

if you see one movie this year... make sure its not this one,"Empire Records is the worst movie about music there possibly can be (with the exception of possibly 8 mile). The basic theme is the workings of a small time record store, about to become a major music store. The problem with this is the fact that it is ALREADY a major music store, but everyone is too damn dumb and blind to realize it. Its an awful movie with awful actors and an awful plot.Absolutely none of the characters have any emotion that's more than skin deep. The one and only thing that was ever remotely good about the movie was seeing Lyv Tyler undress, though it certainly isn't worth it to sit through over an hour and a half of CRAP to see less than I could find on the internet in less than five seconds. Honestly, who could actually like bulls**t like this? I borrowed the movie from a friend, and having seen it I am very glad that I did not pay money to see something like this. I would say I want my money back, but instead I'd like the time wasted on this back to do something more useful like burn as many copies of it as I can. If you really want to see what a real small time record store looks like in the form of a movie (with good acting and an actually interesting plot), see High Fidelity. It's soooooo much better.Once I finished watching this movie, I could only think two things: 1) THANK GOD!!!!!!, and 2) I can't believe that I actually sat through the whole thing. It's probably because I have such a high appreciation for music, that I though it must get better at some point (Steven Tyler must have disowned his daughter after such a disgraceful movie). Despite anticipation though, it only got worse as the ""plot"" thickened, finally drawing to a conclusion that's ""fun for the whole family!""... (Insert fart noise here).This movie gets a 1/10 because I don't have the option to give it anything less.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Nice time browsing in this store!,"Let's see what we have here:  Anthony LaPaglia losing his store and his hair, Liv Tyler on speed throwing her virginity at a George Michael wannabe, a pre-superstar Renee Zellweger as the slut with a heart of gold, Robin Tunney as a slit-wrist Sinead O'Connor, Debi Mazar as the night manager, Ethan Embry being killed by GWAR, and GREASE 2's Maxwell Caulfield as a hair-impaired pop icon wannabe.  And the funny thing is, we've all known these people ... and in some way, we've all been to Empire Records (for me, it's the legendary Princeton Record Exchange).So, the film has the cast, it has the ""feel"", and it certainly has the music.

Empire Records,"A crop of 90's young bright things strut their stuff in this comedy.It's got almost a 'Breakfast Club' style vibe to it and is interesting enough viewing if you are are in the right mood.It isn't great though, and feels almost like a vehicle for this talented group to show off what they can do on the off chance that potential directors of better future projects can sign them up.It has its moments, but nearly 30 years later it's more interesting to think about who of this cast actually went on to achieve their full potential.

charming little gem,"As I sit there watching DVDs, I very often tell myself I'm great at selecting glamorous, likable TV shows, but when it comes to movies...

TV show characters tend to become friends, a movie is very different, everybody's a stranger, I don't care for them.Well, happy to say that EMPIRE RECORDS is a big hot hit with me. It's a small production with a lot of heart that beats a lot of much-bigger movies simply because it is likable, with likable characters. And what a treat to see Renée Zellweger during her glory days! And Liv Tyler entering her STEALING BEAUTY phase. A dream cast, with those two going on as if they're in an Aerosmith music video!Yeah, back then, they weren't big marquee names. Now it is an oddity to see their names so low on the cast list.Not saying it's perfect. I found the first half to be very promising, with the second half a letdown in many places. There are characters (like Jane) going nowhere, just wasting space. But overall, I can see why there is a board poster so obsessed with it, the dude wrote a self- proposed TV series sequel, and, yes, I would have watched.I heartily recommend this one. It's fun!

Mildly offensive teen drama,"Let me start out by saying i was very relieved when i logged onto IMDb and saw that this movie got a 6.1 as this is a pretty bad score (and I'm quite sure this will decrease over time).I know this is a teen movie and i saw it probably a few years too late, but this movie is trash. Bad script, excessive levels of drama (even for a teen flick) and terrible teen stereotyping. What annoys me most about this movie though is the way it trivialises complex issues such as suicide and anorexia/bulimia by presenting them as something you can just simply get over as soon as you accept that you are an incredibly attractive person that perfectly fits the mass media's stereotype of beauty. (which of course most people do not).This is just another Hollywood insult like Pretty Woman and Driving Miss Daisy. If you watch this movie, then it should be back to back with Welcome to the Dolls House, although I'm sure anyone who rated this 8 or higher has probably never heard of that movie.I gave it a 2 because Liv Tyler is worth a squirt.",2.0,Anonymous,Music

(Yes, I know, it WAS as dorky as it sounds).Though nowhere near great, watch Weirdsville - Moyle's newest. A good old Canadian stoner film with many a twists and turns.

Delightful,"This is the last of the great 80's teenage comedies. It was made in 1995, so it is also part of the great slacker comedies of the last 14 years that began with ""Clerks"". The entire cast is fine, but there are five standout performances: Anthony Lapaglia, Rory Cochrane, Robin Tunney, Liv Tyler and Renee Zellweger. We have to thank the movie for capturing the fun and delight of record stores that existed from the 1960's to the 90's. While none of them was as exciting as Empire Records, they were wonderful places where music fans could meet and enjoy the relaxed atmosphere, and who didn't light up when the man behind the counter put on some great music track that everybody started dancing or swaying to.Unfortunately, Barnes and Nobles is the closest thing we have today to an Empire Records store.Still, I say, along with 100 million other fans, lets have an Empire Records Two, Mr. Moyle.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

I cannot even begin to comprehend how anyone can stand to tolerate this garbage. It seems like the entire film was conceived in a single evening. There was no thought or foresight put into this filth whatsoever. It's as if the screenwriter wrote a first draft and then immediately started handing the scripts out to B-movie actors. The abominations in this film which they call ""characters"" are completely unlikable. Many of their performances could have be pulled off using cardboard cutouts attached to oscillating fans. This movie's paper-thin plot advanced for about the first 10 minutes, then proceeded to spin its wheel in monotony and trash comedy until the last 20 minutes. I can't imagine that anyone could have read this script and thought, ""Yeah that sounds like a great idea. Let's do it!"" The actors in this film come off as budget acting school dropouts, who are hardly worthy of any roles at all. Plain and simple: DO NOT BOTHER.

A big franchise is about to take over, so before The Man puts them all on 'mute', they decide to go out on a high. Apart from the suicidal goth chick, of course.With characters as sketchily drawn as these, it's no surprise that most of the cast are still unknown - with the notable exceptions of Renee Zellweger and Liv Tyler. The former did her career no harm by making the most of her sweet-slut role but, let's face it, Liv's looks and lineage were always going to guarantee her stardom.A harmless enough teen flick but essentially High Fidelity with an insipid script and inferior performances.

making of Impire Records,"Back in 1995 I was working as a security guard for the local movie set ,and I was assigned to this move as it was filmed in Wilmington NC .I worked close with the cast ,and sometimes talked to Liv,and Renee.They were a blast to be around ,and made my job fun .I will never forget the way Renee had to go out for lunch ,instead of the food truck provided ,and I had to go with her so she wouldn't get mobbed by fans .Funny thing about the Impire Records store was ,It was filmed in the front of a gay bar ,and well their parties had to go on .I was in charge of rerouting ""them"" to the rear ha ha ....But the movie ,The plot was great ,and coulda used a nude scene .but all in all a good movie .I watched little Renee and Liv grow to become great actors ,and get big roles in big films .I kinda miss those days when I an every day Joe ,got to meet ""the stars"" oh yea by the way ,glad Renee learned to sing lol",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Rough going,"I guess this is the kind of film you see when you are a teenager and think: ""Wow, this is really in touch with my generation"". Boy did I miss that boat. Sitting in a room, in a hostel, in Budapest, I watched this movie and then experienced one of the worst nights of sleep I've ever had (2 and a half hours to be exact). Americans came barging into the room at 2 in the morning and proceeded to make out in each other's beds for the next 5 hours. When I left at 6am the following morning two thoughts were racing(actually more like plodding) through my head: ""I hate American teenagers and I hate this movie."" I can't list anything redeeming about this movie, and frankly I'm wasting my time trying to care enough to write a paragraph about this amateurfest. It was the perfect movie for my hellnight in Budapest.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
"Better for a second watch, great soundtrack","Found this by accident really. Had browsed the 'top titles' and nothing took my fancy and just went surfing the racks and saw this. After the first view was pleasantly surprised and subsequently have re-viewed and have taken to it a lot. Still haven't mentioned the greatest thing about this movie - the soundtrack. So many classics, and for me so many from when I grew up. Flying Lizards sticks out as a favourite and sadly doesn't appear on the soundtrack CD. As for the acting, it was as expected just good performances. Some have moved on to bigger and better, some have not. Some questionable threads in the plot but I always try to remember why I watch movies and that is to be entertained, this movie does that.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
HOT MESS,"As someone who existed in the 90s the same age as the actors and characters I did find some of it nostalgic. The music selection was a mess and didn't capture the era well, but there were a few good one's mixed in. It was refreshing to see realistic 90s clothes and the actors were good.The story was a mess, lacked logic and continuity, other than the fact that it was a nonsensical mess the whole way through. The characters were barely tolerable and the scenarios unrealistic in every way. The attempt at humor was weak and overall the movie felt like it was trying to be too many things at once. Overall if felt like a wannabe John Hughes movie past relevance even in 1995.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

Have a few laughs and send it off to oblivion,"This 1990s teens/20s comedy is pretty awful for the most part, but it does have its pleasures. Among them are the opportunity to watch pre-superstardom Liv Tyler and Renee Zellweger prancing gorgeously around, and some appearances by other young actors who went on to do more interesting stuff. The dumb script centers around a Tower Records-like store where the characters all work. One of them took the store's proceeds and lost it all gambling, and now everyone is trying frantically to keep the place from being sold to a competitor - or something along those lines. It deserves a viewing and a few good laughs before being sent off to oblivion.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

Rock 'n Roll Fun!,"This movie was worth seeing in my opinion. My instincts shows that this movie is a real hit. A marvelous cast, a great plot, and plenty of sex appeal made this movie really good. Anthony LaPaglia, Debi Mazar, Renne Zellweger, and Liv Tyler made this movie a hit. Rory Cochrane is astonishing at playing Lucas, the employee who gambles the $9000+ in a casino. Sure he got slammed by the boss, but who wants to be bought out by a bigwig who wants only money? I wouldn't. Then comes in Rex Manning(Maxwell Caulfield), a music video, TV legend who helps promote the store, is nothing more than a time-warped has been. Cory(Tyler) really showed her sexual prowess in the lunch scene. That's Steve's daughter for ya! Rock on! And there's Debra(Robin Tunney) very bipolar, shaves her head, then gets to lighten up and see what's really important. When the employees and their boss fight against the buyout, they are the heroes of the movie. Strum a guitar on that one. The music was great, the scenes are fantastic, it's too bad this movie was a limited premiere. I give it 3 stars, just to be honest.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

It gives hope to me in a strange way that even though everything around you sucks that you have the power to change it...all it takes is fate.  The reason that this movie is so great is that its characters are all of us,(very reminiscent of Breakfast Club) you have to identify with at least one if not all of the characters in some asspect.

Entirely unremarkable,"Once upon a time there were these places called record stores. People went to these places to buy music. Empire Records is a movie set in such a place. The young employees of Empire Records band together to try and prevent their quirky, independent store being sold to one of those big, bad corporations which will turn the place into a soulless, generic Music Town. If they'd only known the changes which would be coming to the music industry in the next decade they wouldn't have bothered. Anyone up for Empire Records 2: The Day iPods Put Us Out of Business? Eh, probably not. One movie spent with this bunch of unremarkable, unoriginal slackers is enough.Empire Records is a movie which is overly familiar. We've seen so many similar stories with similar characters. There's nothing to make this movie stand out from the crowd. All the clichéd characters we've come to expect from a movie like this are here. The slut, the virgin, the depressed loner, the artist, the stoner. There's the eccentric guy, the comic relief guy, the father figure. Every character fits into a neat little box. The result is less than inspiring. The movie is incredibly predictable. There's no real drama. Attempts at comedy fall flat. The whole thing seems very unfocused. All the characters have their own little stories. But we never really spend enough time with any of those characters to become fully engaged in those stories. Everyone and everything gets tossed together into a big stew and the end result is underwhelming. Some of the performances are pretty good, with the girls generally coming off better than the boys. Watching this movie it's easy to see why Renée Zellweger, Robin Tunney and Liv Tyler were destined for bigger and better things. The guys though are rather forgettable. Probably the best male performance comes from Maxwell Caulfield playing a washed-up pop star. At least his character adds a little something different to the movie. Otherwise it's all about this group of young slackers, none of whom has an individual story which stands out and whose overriding collective quest, to save the store from corporate blandness, isn't particularly compelling. The best thing the movie has to offer is its soundtrack, a nice mid-1990s musical time capsule. But tossing some snippets from some good songs into the mix, and somehow managing to entertainingly shoehorn Gwar into the plot, isn't enough to save the movie. We've seen a lot of other movies like this one. Most of those other movies have been much better than Empire Records.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

"""Breakfast Club"" of the 90's","Empire Records is a great movie about life and music in the 90's. The characters are in some ways generic archetypes, and in other ways well fleshed out individuals.

They did a great job of acting without taking themselves too seriously. The movie also has great quotable lines and a wonderful soundtrack.

Yea the general premise is slightly interesting and could've had potential (with the right director and screenwriter) but doesn't amount to much and is very one-note, play-in-the-background film you have on while doing chores or anything less time-wasting than watching this film.

Grow a little,"This film is one of the best teen movies, I first watched it ten years ago when I was 12. I was hooked,you may assume that to occupy the mind of a 12 year old would be simple. But for a film to hold its charm throughout the whole period in which a teen ""grows up"" for a whole decade its truly incredible. It wasn't just because of the cast (although it is a good one) it was a mix of passionate music and dark humour, intelligent undertones suggesting subtle but impactive multi- stranded narratives each coping with their own dilemma. However big or small. The film satisfyingly draws you in. You feel every-thing for the film and the characters in it, that Allan Moyles wants you to feel.

"I'm Cool, Honest!","Well get this, kids.  Hip indie record story is threatened by The Man (i.e. a proposed take-over by a big, and therefore evil, music chain).  The manager isn't helped by on of his employees gambling away his buyout funds, the rest of them spending most of their time pratting about or the visit of a superannuated rock star.  But, after a few predictable bouts of teenage angst, everything somehow ends happily in a big party.It's actually quite hard putting down a film which so desperately wants to be liked, and which features some of Hollywood's brighter young things (Angeline Joly etc.)  There are also a couple of good moments and a smattering of fine lines.  Unfortunately it shares the common Hollywood misconception that record shop employees are impossibly cool and they and their customers keeping breaking out into spontaneous dance.  And most of the scenes not irritating are soppy.  And for such a supposedly happening film, its soundtrack is frankly lame.

For lovers of music and the mid 90s.,"The script is very light, and characters are stereotypical. But the feeling's there, and some sequences (musical interludes) are really good. No real complaints about the acting, either. The movie itself, is like a teen version of Clerks, with the same offbeat ness. Only it's not Clerks (hah!). And for once, the romantic aspect didn't take too much of the screen time. Until it actually does near the end. I honestly don't see the Breakfast Club parallel, other reviewers find in it. As these characters are more or less friends, and already used to be amongst each other. It has a very mid 90s ish aesthetic, and MTV generation written all over. But it is a cool little time capsule of mid-90s music, fashion and pop culture. And is filled with well-known actors, at the earliest of their acting careers. It's worth checking.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

"Watchable, sure...","Actually I do believe that I have watched this movie once before, as parts of its seemed familiar. However, I must admit that I can't remember the plot or storyline. So I suppose it was nice that I stumbled upon it here in 2024, and opted to give the movie a spin once more.While ""Empire Records"" was watchable, it just wasn't really a movie that tickled me in the right places. It is hardly a classic movie, nor a movie that was a major part of the 1990s for me. Writer Carol Heikkinen wrote a script and storyline that appeals to a different target audience than what I belong to now. But I suppose 20 year old me, in 1995, might have viewed the movie with in a different light back in 1995.I have to say that I was surprised and impressed with the cast ensemble in this 1995 movie. I mean, with the likes of Anthony LaPaglia, Maxwell Caulfield, Rory Cochrane, Debi Mazar, Ethan Embry, Robin Tunney, Johnny Whitworth, Renée Zellweger and Liv Tyler, then you definitely have some familiar faces and good talents on the screen. Good acting performances from the cast ensemble helps bring the story and characters to life on the screen.I doubt I will ever return to watch ""Empire Records"" again, now that I have the storyline freshened up in my memory for years to come.My rating of director Allan Moyle's 1995 movie ""Empire Records"" lands on a five out of ten stars.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Plotless,"Going into Empire records, I admit that I had high expectations.  Having just come off of a High Fidelity buzz (Record store movies were kind of a theme that night), I decided to watch Empire for the first time and afterwards I was very let down.So many people I know talk about this movie as if it were some kind of a god-send or something.  To me it was just mediocre at best.  The beginning starts off very funny with Lucas' debacle, and I would think that they would really take that and build a decent plot around it; but the writer and director failed...miserably.The problem is that this movie is way too outlandish and indecisive.  No one person is the central focus, the movie is comprised of several little sub plots, and this gives the audience no real connection to any of the characters and caused me to not give a d-mn about any of them.  What little plot the movie has is just too weak to hold up, and so many unrealistic situations happen.As far as being funny, there were few moments where I genuinely laughed. And as far as being dramatic, I couldn't feel for any of the characters because of the lack of attention focused on any one of them.  Empire Records is at best an average ""teen flick"" and couldn't keep me interested.  Want a better movie involving a record store?  See High Fidelity.

Very Cool Little Movie From The 90's,"I own and have seen empire records many times. The first time I seen this movie was at film school.

Jane to prove a point. She hates her life and wants to kill herself. Then you have Rene Z who is gorgeous in her youth in this film. She plays Liv Tyler's nymphomaniac friend. Then there is a couple other characters along with the cool boss Joe. The main plot of this story is about Lucas, assistant manager wanting to save the store from being bought out by Mega Mart or whatever cheesy corporate company wants to buy out Empire Records. So he takes all the closing money from Empire one night when he works and gets on his bike and goes to Atlantic city in hopes of making a lot of money so he can save the store.

'Who knows where thoughts come from',"The first time I watched Empire Records, I pressed the rewind button as soon as it finished, and watched the whole thing again, just to let it sink in that I had found a film that I really, really enjoyed.Empire Records was not a film made to win Oscars, that is not the point of it.  What Empire Records succeedes in doing is taking a day in the life of a place that all teenagers can relate to (A music shop), taking a cast of gorgeous, hip young things, playing a brilliant soundtrack throughout, and chucking in some quotes that you can go over again, and again with your friends (me and my friend's personal favourite is Joe and Lucas' 'where's the money gone' conversation, that is as funny now as it was all those many viwings ago).Anybody who disregards Empire Records as a badly-acted, unrealistic film with a weak story-line, and cliched characters are missing the point entirely.

That period, I fear, was not exactly a stellar period.  This film contains a dance number to AC-DC.  Thats right.  Because the kids absolutely LOVE David Bowie.  And dance numbers.

"An Embarrassment to the ""Rock 'n Roll Movie"" Genre.","This film was a major disappointment. Knowing that 2 of the co-stars later appeared in ""That Thing You Do"" (one of my favorite Rock & Roll oriented films), gave me false hope that ""Empire Records"" would be another Rock & Roll music-driven joy-ride. No such luck.The plot is virtually non-existent, appearing to be made-up-as-they go. The opener has one of the half-dozen co-workers of a CD/record store run off to Atlantic City, determined to quadruple the embezzled daily takings, so the store won't be sold to a ruthless chain. Immediately the story switches to showing how each of the late-teen-ish store workers are ""messed up"".A young shoplifter who is prosecuted, then returns with a gun, is forgiven and offered a job (apparently all in the same day). A side-plot shows a has-been Pop-Idol (with far too much pancake make-up) as a shameless womanizing creep. All ends well, when a Party-A-Thon saves the store. Lots of teen-stuff, with references to inappropriate and dangerous behavior, glamourized and made appealing.This film is a disservice to films of this genre. Teens are not better for watching this poor example of how-to-be-a-success. Harldy any POOR decision has been missed by this teen-angst nightmare. AVOID this film. The small consolation is the VERY GOOD Soft & Hard Rock Sound Track. No other redeeming value. Sorry.",2.0,Anonymous,Music

This movie is the single greatest thing in my life,this movie is the greatest the actors are so great i know people that act just like them i love eddy i believe he is over looked by most of the people that watched the movie anyone who gives this movie a bad review is insane the fact that the movie is so far fetched is what makes it great all teenagers wish they worked at a record store like that one to be able to just choose what is being played in the store and dance around and have fun Empire Records is a teenage utopia if you don't identify with this movie you were never a teenager i was a little disappointed in the soundtrack it didn't include some of the best songs in the movie but other than that the soundtrack was great warren is the best he is so over the top its great most people over look how great this movie is i loved every character it felt like i could be best friends with all of them this movie is awesome and you hope that Lucas gets out of his jam and cheer for Corey and AJ and want to know why deb did what she did this movie sucks you in and makes you feel what all the characters feel this movie is great,10.0,Anonymous,Music
Absolutely Brilliant,"This film is right up there in my top 100 movies (I find it hard to narrow down into a top 10!). Empire Records has everything: the music, great and likable characters, comedy, romance and drama. All the actors are superb, and many of them I find still don't get the credit they deserve. One of Liv Taylor's best performances to date, and one of Renee Zellweger's first but best roles. I could name the rest of the cast too, because they are equally or even more brilliant than those mentioned, lets just say there is a huge diversity in character, yet they all seem to have something in common. They all love their job, and who wouldn't! Believe me, when you watch this film, you will be wishing you too worked at Empire. This quirky, original movie, is one I can guarantee you will love, so give it a watch. The more times you watch, the more you get hooked.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Damn the Man,"This movie does not fit the profile of my other favorite movies, but I love it. Maybe it is because I briefly worked for a small local record shop, but I don't think so.I really enjoy the music. It is a fast paced movie with very few lulls in the plot. It has intriguing characters who face many obstacles I faced during that exact time, at that exact age. I'm now in my early 30s, and this movie provides a brief look at some of what the 90's were about for me. Passion about music, girls, motorcycles, doing goofy things, and having fun. I think music was more diverse back then, and I still love the soundtrack. This is a great movie to sit back and enjoy, it doesn't require a lot of thought, but it creates a lot of laughs and provides many memorable quotes. Damn the man!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Sex, drugs and alcohol in a day while teenage employees try to save their record store.","This is a great movie.  A typical 80's genre movie about high school/college age kids, with a kicking 90's soundtrack.  No good for taking seriously, but a great movie to have fun with.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Hilarious and real,"Empire Records is my favorite movie of all time. It is the portrayal of one crazy day in a record store. The characters are all completely different and the different reactions we get from each them in each situation allows the audience to relate to every circumstance in one way or another. Many people, however, may not like the movie, simply because it does not mesh with their sense of humor. The humor is definately aimed at teens of today, although my parents think it is hilarious. Backed with an outstanding soundtrack, I have found it impossible to get sick of it. I laugh everytime. Most of the humor is not found in jokes but rather in the characters, especially Lucas, Mark, and Rex Manning (at least in his video). Well definately see the movie, but keep in mind while your watching it, the movie isn't a comedy but the character's personalities make it funny.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Not the best movie I've seen, but possibly the one I've seen the most.","Ever since the second day of my Junior year in college, Empire Records has held a position of mythic importance in my life and that of those around me. I've probably seen it around 100 times, often provoking others with taunts such as, ""You could study, or you could watch Empire Records!"" I'll be the first to admit that as film goes, ER is not all that great, but then again, something must be right for it to still be watchable after 100 viewings. Go watch it.  Many times.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A Day In The Life,"Ever wonder where the cool slackers hang out and what they do on a daily basis. Well, here is the 1995 version of that. This comedy / drama is easily the best of it's kind. This ranks up there with ""Dazed and Confused"" and ""Chasing Amy"" as the best slacker movies of all time, even though all three are from the same decade. Maybe it's because the 90's was the decade of the slacker.Once upon a time, before digital downloading dominated the music scene, cool kids hung out at record stores. In this film a talented cast plays a variety of these cool kids (and adults). Liv Tyler plays the pretty and popular brainiac who is headed to Harvard. Renee Zelweger is the sultry teenaged seductress. Johnny Whitworth is the artist who is afraid to do anything with his talent. The amazing Rory Cochrane is the 'James Dean' type who is sort of the mystical center of the movie. Robin Tunney gives a haunted performance of a troubled, suicidal teen. Rounding out the rest of the teen cast, there are also two boys who worship rock & roll as well as a wanna-be guitarist.The adult cast is just as amazing as the younger actors, though outnumbered. Joe Mantegna plays 'Joe', the ex-musician and current record store manager who knows that he was meant for bigger and better things. Zoe Deschanel is the manager of a washed up pop star who is attempting a comeback. She shares Joe's views of her life. And Maxwell Caulfield is 'Rex Manning', the aforementioned pop star. He is perhaps the most underrated actor in the film. He plays ""Sexy Rexy"" with a cheesy self assurance that is masking the fact that Rex knows that his sex symbol days are well behind him.The plot of the film is pretty thin. The owner of the record store plans to sell the store to a franchise that promises to rid the store and it's employees of any individuality. But that's okay, because the movie isn't really plot driven. It's a character study about the young and the young at heart hiding their true ambitions and selves behind false facades while they wile away their days hanging out at the record store.Overall, this is a well written movie about characters that are well worth rooting for. It also boasts a great soundtrack of rock and alternative music that helps add to the fun atmosphere.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
This has to be the best teen movie ever made.,"Empire records isn't really one of those movies that relies on a plot. Sure, there is a plot- they need to make money to save the record store but that's not the most important thing about this movie.  I love the characters in this movie.  They're not the typical teen movie characters but you can see a little Breakfast Club in them if you look hard enough.   It is cleverly written and very applicable if you're into memorizing lines.  I strongly recommend seeing this movie- several times! Save the Empire!",10.0,Anonymous,Music

"Damn the man, save the Empire","""Damn the man, save the Empire"". That is the theme of the movie and one of the best quotes ever.My friends and I watched this movie over and over (and over again) in around 1997. I just saw it again recently and was flooded with memories.It is probably not the best theatrical movie of it's time but it is one that I feel really captured a time in America's youth when we were coming out of grunge rock and heading to god knows what. It is a movie that will always remind me of my youth, when it was easier to say ""Damn the man, save the Empire!"" and not be worried about the consequences that those words may have.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Excellent plotline and cast!,"Empire Records is a unique, hilarious movie that has been my favorite since I've seen it in 95. There's an intriguing and original plotline, yes, but the cast of characters really brought it to life. Liv Tyler plays the short-tempered Corey, Johnny Whitworth plays the adorable (A.K.A. hot) artist A.J., Ethan Embry (as Ethan Randall) plays the strange rocker Mark, Coyote Shivers plays the guitar playing Berko, and Anthony LaPaglia plays Joe, the manager of Empire Records, who brings it all together. This movie has a great soundtrack, and I especially liked the headbanging scenes. All in all, a great funny movie you can watch again and again.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"my youth, I love this one","Hey, So normally, unintelligent movies make me cry and rip my hair out. But I loved and always shall love Empire Records, because it's soundtrack, it's colorful antics/setting/wardrobes and beautiful (if not Oscar-worthy, not at the time of EMPIRE, anyways...sorry, Ms. Zellweger) cast overpower its lack of a deep, realistic, juicy storyline. I love Anthony Lapaglia, I love the quotes from this film (too many to list, really!) and I think there's no one more attractive than Johnny Lee Miller as ""AJ the soulful artist, in love..."", though Ethan Embry in his skaters doofballness is still cute, in my mind's eye.Rent it and watch it with your girlfriends, then quote it forever til you annoy people.It made me want to work in a record store:)",8.0,Anonymous,Music
required viewing,"It's safe to say I love this movie. Anyone who works with high school or college students (or those of that age group) must watch this film. It proves that life is never dull or meaningless if you're surrounded by people who really care about you, even if those people are your fellow tattooed, gum-chewing freaks. I love the friendships between these kids and their relationship with their boss. Anyone who doesn't understand Lucas and Joe's relationship has never had a mentor or been one. And Joe's love/hate relationship with his workers is so well written and portrayed. When I watched this for the first time, I was trying to figure out just when the writer had been a fly on my wall. My favorite line: ""Have I fired anyone today? No! Why would I start with you?"" I suggest watching it repeatedly. You'll catch something new every time.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
One of the best movies of my life,I just can't get enough of this movie. There are some very sexy guys like Ethan Embry in it and unforgettable characters. It represents teen life in my opinion and it just good fun. My favorite character would have to be Lucus (the guy who has to sit on the couch for almost the whole movie.) He is so funny! He's just gives insight on life and is so funny to watch. I think that you should see this movie if you haven't and enjoy. Buh-Bye,9.0,Anonymous,Music
"An animated film, full of rebellion and energy.","Remember the stores that sold music records and CDs? There are still some, and the rebirth of vinyl, very recent, has allowed a certain rebirth of the commercial sector, somewhat in response to the massification and popularization of music in ""streaming"" and digital downloads that we already have as something common in our lives. This film is about a store open 24 hours a day, with spaces to sell and listen to music. It is managed by young people, with young employees, an idiot owner and a manager who dreams of buying the space. It turns out that one of the employees decided to go to a casino and lost all the money saved for that project.The action takes place the day after the incident. In addition to the fate of the store and its employees, which is at stake, each one lives their own story, has characteristics and personality. Incidentally, the entire construction and development of the story and characters is one of the most positive aspects of the film. We have a young teenager who particularly wants to lose her virginity but has serious problems with amphetamines, an aspiring art major, a crook with a complicated childhood, a liberal girl who seems to particularly enjoy sexual adventures, a crazy rocker. In addition to the employees, we also have a former musical star who decides to go there to promote a new CD and cause some funny problems.The film has an impressive cast and it's worth seeing who the actors are and where they are today. We understand well that each one wanted to make the best use of this opportunity. Contrary to what the posters suggest, Liv Tyler, who is the daughter of a rock musician, has a character without a leading role, but does an excellent job, even acting opposite her (then) stepfather, Coyote Shivers. Rory Cochrane, Renée Zellweger and Ethan Embry are also here, and each of them does a very competent job. Despite the centrality of his character, Anthony La Paglia does not steal the spotlight for himself and shares our attention with his co-stars generously and doing a very well done job. We also have Robin Tunney, bald and rebellious, Debi Mazar and Johnny Whitworth. The less sympathetic roles go to Max Caulfield and Ben Bode, and they're refreshingly comic.On a technical level, what stands out positively is the enormous animation of the film. There are no dead moments. The story is constructed in such a way as to give us a kind of moral about the brevity of life and the need to take advantage of the time, live life, even taking risks and making mistakes. Added to this is a strident soundtrack, full of strength, where rock predominates and emanates energy, positivity and rebelliousness. The songs used here are well known and fans of the rock genre will love it. Incidentally, the albums released with the soundtrack were a success, in absolute contrast to the film itself, which failed in cinemas, was bombed by critics and only acquired a certain popularity and public recognition in much more recent years. Perhaps it was simply ahead of its time.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A Terrific Movie,"Only a few months ago, I was introduced to this movie by a few friends. All I have to say to them is Thank you!  This Movie is terrific, the acting, especially Ethan Embry's portrayal of ""Mark,"" blew me away.  It was spectacular.  Unfortunately, I've read many negative reviews of this movie. I'd like to remind those viewers that life doesn't always need to be serious.  Go Crazy, have a little fun!  It won't hurt you once, and that's the attitude you must have while watching this movie.Also, I'd like to address the fact that many negative reviewers have targeted the fans of the movie, saying that they are ""dumb,"" and that they hate the watch the world be taken over by them.  Don't target the fans, everyone has a different taste.  Please.  Its just immature.In conclusion, I rate this movie a 10 out of 10.  The acting is brilliant, (once again, especially by Embry, his laugh, attitude, the entire essence of him never to be duplicated) and the one liners are hilarious.  Great Job!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Great cheesy feelgood teen comedy,"Despite a fairly heavy layer of schmaltz, this is a fun, heartwarming film. More in the style of an eighties, John Hughes-style teen comedy than the more clever-clever nineties batch it came along with, this basically follows a gang of semi-stereotyped kids all working in a wacky record shop, dealing with their adolescent issues and trying to save their store; of course the answer to all their problems turns out to be a big party at the end. Most of the characters are pretty lovable, all interesting; the actors, particularly the less well-known ones, all perform brilliantly and seem to be having a great time doing it. Even the most hardened cynic will find it hard not to smile, particularly at the end.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

The characters have depth, the dialogue is snappy, and no one in the movie is a cliche.  I enjoy that it's portrayal of teenagers is the most accurate I have seen.

The cast was pretty good and the multiple plot lines kept me interested. Besides...who can resist the scenes that all of the employees rock out to and the witty lines?

Why the world should view Empire Records,"OK... where do I begin? I LOVE Empire Records. I am a total fanatic. I think that everyone should have a chance to see it!! The trailer was horrible, in my personal opinion, and the summary on the back of the DVD case is not to far from nothing like the movie itself. It's funny, random, romantic, dramatic, and overall overly entertaining. It's very easy to relate to, because there's no real backbone to Empire Records, like real life. It takes place over one day, one day filled with the problems, excitement, and more of different people's lives. Each and every character has an original--yet realistic--personality. So damn the man! Save the Empire! :D",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"A really fun, funny and touching look into the lives of people who work at a record store","This is a really great movie.

The story is totally unconventional. The writing is great. I hope Allen Moyle does more movies of this kind. It is definitely his strong suit. I never like Robin Tunney much before i saw this movie but I am a fan now. She's a fearless actress. Very underrated and deserves to have a much better career.

Thankyou for making this film!,"What I loved about this movie was it's connection with the audience across multiple levels. There were moments of hilarity, anguish, excitement, disgust and outright loss of control, which were all bolstered by the thematic mirroring of music. The soundtrack to Empire Records evokes the mindset of the youths in the record store and enhances everything so that that it leaps off the screen, into your ears, swirls around your brain for a bit and then spurts out again through every limb. I found myself banging along to the music of the Gin Blossoms, AC/DC and even Sexy Rex Manning! It conveyed the plight of the youth without being trite or pretentious owing to great performances from the whole cast and some inspired direction. The casting agents must have wet their pants when these guys rolled in to audition!

Okay, the characters and plot aren't very well developed, but its a feel good, escapist teen movie full of laughs, and is probably responsible for much of the younger generations' aspirations to work in a record store.  The characters are funny, especially Mark, and there is an abundance of one-liners.  Also, as someone else commented, it has become very nostalgic of the early to mid-90s.

When Rory Cochrane says ""I wish that I was born blind so that I could look upon your face but once and spit in the wrong direction"" you know that it ain't no jive talking. Everyone else is excellent. When I comb my hair it creates a natural pompadour similar to Rex Manning, who has a sort of priggish charm.

A weird movie that somehow works,"I was reading all the comments given to Empire Records and I have to say that they sum it up. Empire Records seems to have nothing going for it and then suddenly it turns into this guilty pleasure that you can't get enough of. When I was in high school my entire class knew Empire Records off by heart. I'm not talking that they could speak along with the movie, we could do it sitting in class, and we did, for fun. The acting isn't great, the story is unoriginal, it all turns out in a sickening saccharine way, but for some reason it grabs teenagers and sucks them in. I think it's because all the characters, their clothes and lives and jobs and words and music are what teenagers want to be. I think it deserves some credit for that, and for Lucas, who remains one of my favorite fantasies to this day.",,Anonymous,Music

He now has a penknife cutting out the outline of the figure he was drawing. When Joe hands A.J. rules and standards for Music Town, A.J. sets clipboard on table...in next shot the clipboard is still in his lap. Deb's funeral IS still there. When Warren comes in with the gun look in the background, you still see candles burning and do for the whole scene. Even when the cops are talking to Joe, in the background you see the snuffed candles and the cross. When Jane quits, Joe turns on jukebox and Lucas hits intercom on the phone, but when Mitch shows up, Gina uses intercom to say ""Guess who's here?"". Then when the music is turned off the siren goes off like it was being played from the stereo out front. When A.J. is outside painting and Corey comes out, check out the background.

decent movie from semi-decent script,"A good example of a movie where the main character isn't a person but a thing, in particular in this movie, a record store.  Allan Moyle stuck with what he seems to know best, teenagers and suicide (as in Pump Up the Volume).  While this movie provides general entertainment, it is almost a perfect example of another teen movie that was written without purpose. There isn't much that makes this movie different than most teen movies of the 90's.  The characters aren't believable as teenagers, at the most, late teenagers, early 20's.Then we have the unbelievabilty of the character Joe who doesn't do anything except help, yet again the boy who stole $9,000 dollars from his store. Forgive me, but most managers aren't going to take that in stride like its an everyday occurrence.  The only believable teen character in the movie would be Warren, except him showing back up in the store with a gun.If there is to be any real praise for this film it would be for Allan Moyle; however, he did much better work with Pump Up the Volume, especially with delivering a message.  Empire sold itself on its soundtrack, not on story or acting.   Definitely watch it, but literally don't expect anything, it runs in the same vein as Swingers and Clerks in telling a story with no story. And while Swingers and Clerks pulled this off far better, they had a more believable basis than what the creators designed for Empire Records.",,Anonymous,Music

trendy garbage,"I cant believe people like this movie. This is a ripoff of Dazed and Confused and John Hughes. It shows the trials and tribulations along with the hardships of working in a record store. It is totally unrealistic and should be banned. All of the actors look like they are bored to death. I know that some of the actors have talent, with the exception of Ethan Embry but this is an embarrassment. It's only redeeming value is a cameo by Gwar and a cast of beautiful women. Too bad having gorgeous women cant save a movie. Teen dreck. Zero stars",,Anonymous,Music
EMPIRE RECORDS a Teen Trash Classic,"In reality, this movie really stinks. It's obviously rushed, not well thought out, and reeks of mid-90's alt-slacker non-revolution. Yet it's totally interesting from a cinematic standpoint as we watch Allan Moyle cannibalize the themes from his previous teen pictures into one big ball of overly-romantic teen angst. It's compulsively watchable and highly embarrassing at the same time; you wouldn't want to be caught watching it by your friends. Everybody in this film seems to be having a good time making it and that vibe is infectious. It also gets better with repeated viewings. Go figure.",,Anonymous,Music
"lovable, enjoyable, hilarious","First off, I'm a 21 year-old, so when this movie came out, it was smack targeted at my age-group, which in fact, should've ended(probably did) that 'target'with people in their mid-twenties.The one bad thing I have to say is...sorry, but, I'm one of the few people who don't like Liv Tyler. Guys, I tried. Maybe someday, I will, but it hasn't gotten to that stage yet. this means that, to me, anybody could've played the part of ""Cory"". But this leads me to the next good thing about this movie.See, Allan Moyle just uses actors as pions to the mood he wants to invoke. It doesn't mean that all his characters are realistic, but many times, they are. For example, the typical, ""lost soul"" kind of girl who can't find her mom, treats people like garbage, and tries to commit suicide, is cliche because it's been covered countless times in the past. But the attitude it gives us about her, almost like, 'if you don't just think about yourself, and get some humor into your life, pieces will come together' is strikingly original. Same with the other characters. I'm sure you already knows that this is directed by Allan Moyle, same guy who directed ""Pump Up The Volume."" You can sense the similarities, one of them being the cool effects that peer togetherness/pressure can bring, in Pump Up The Volume it was Slater's fans, in this flick, towards the end, all the young peers who have probably only HEARD of how cool Empire Records is, go there and raise money and help it out. In short, this is done to create Empire Records as a cult hit.Okay, now cool quotes.""Lucas, where's the money?"" Joe, the money is gone. ""Where's it gone to?"" ""U-h-h...Atlantic City."" ""Really. What's it DOING in Atlantic City?!"" ""...recirculating?"" ""Lucas-"" ""Joe"" Lucas-""""Joe"" (then, about the owner) ""Lucas, I told Mitchell, you forgot to deposit the money. I told him it was still in the safe!"" ""Joe that's not true, it's in Atlantic City...I swear!""and then, when Empire Records is about to become Music Town, Gina (Renee Zellweger) and Debra(the ""lost soul"" girl) are reading the rulesDeb- ""no tattoos or piercing."" Gina- ""No revealing clothing."" D- ""we're both screwed. At least you're used to it. G-0h, Deb. Don't be bitter. I'm sure with your ever growing collection of flesh-mutilating appendages and your new Neo-Nazi bootcamp makeover, the boys'll come-a-runnin'.

Best Movie,Okay for you silly people you hate this movie what is wrong with you?!?! This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. A bunch of misfits working in a record shop. It is full of energy and each character has its own problem. It is so good!!!,,Anonymous,Music
Where's the Advil?,"I cannot remember a movie that has given me such a headache.  I sat there for about a minute as the credits rolled, wondering what on earth had driven me to renting this movie.  Why does everyone have a problem?  Why is everyone so unrealistic?  Is it possible Mark is the most annoying character of any film of the 90s?  I don't know the answer to the first two questions, but I'd say the answer to the last is that he's at least in the top five.",,Anonymous,Music
Music and Teen Angst,"While this movie is one definatley worth watching, there are still certain aspects of it that make me cringe. First of all the casting of Johnny Whitworth as AJ was a terrible decision. This character was supposed to be intresting and deep. However by casting a pretty boy I found my self hating this character. If this movie was made ten years ealrier John Cusak would have played AJ, of course because of the music it would have been a entriely different film.As much as I hated Johnny Whitmore I did think that Anthony Lapalglia was great as Joe. Joe was supposed to be like that groovy guidance counselor in high school who was always there to look out for you. Lapaglia plays this character just right. There is no doubt that this material is below him but he handles it very well.Some of the other memembers of this cast are also entertaining to watch. Another good performance comes from Rory Cochrane as Lucas, the philospher and smart ass of the group. Also this film features a pre-Jerry Maquire Rene Zellwegaras the slutty Gina.The story it's self is nothing really revoluntionary. A group of mistfits work in a record store that is going to be made into a Sam Goody type outlet store very soon and all the freedom their cool, hip boss, Joe has provided them will be gone. Oh and there is the girl dealing with suicide, heart ache, and ultimatley love growing from heart ache. At certain points in this film it seems like it is trying to be a 90's take of Dazed and Confused. Dealing with teen issue while packing the movie full of period music and colorful characters. However, rest assure it is no Dazed and ConfusedThe rest of the movie is just alright. It is a good movie to catch on VH1 every once and awhile or even rent when you can't think of anything else. For me the film's soundtrack brought me back to the good ole' days of 1995. Coming home from the 7th grade turing on the radio while doing homework and listening to the Gin BlossomsCatch the movie if it is on or rent it when you got nothing else to see, it's good for that.",,Anonymous,Music

"""I wonder if I'll be held responsible for this?""","What a film. It doesn't make the mistake of other teen hits, by trying to be deep and meaningful. It's about being young, having fun, and living life. If you don't find yourself quoting from this film after the first viewing, something's wrong. If you don't know the entire script after the second or third, something's seriously wrong. And if you don't bother watching it at least once a week, then you're far too busy for your own good.The cast all give great performances, but this isn't a film which is open to dissection. It has one soul (typo intended!) purpose - enjoyment. Well maybe two if you count the feel-good factor. And don't get me started on the soundtrack. Really. Don't just rent it. Buy it, own it, and watch it over and over and over.....8/10",,Anonymous,Music
"A little noticed, but excellent scene.","In ""Empire Records"", many of the scenes seemed to focus on only the main characters.Fortunately for me, there was a personally favorite scene, where Mark tries to kiss the ballerina (Melissa Caulfield).

Tries so hard that it fails...,"I saw this movie when I was a teen (late teens) but did not feel that it ""spoke"" to me.  There are a lot of coming of age, comedy-dramas that really identify with their core viewers but this was not one of them.  Over-acting and ridiculously obvious characters kept it from becoming the feel-good movie of the year.  It's not a waste of time however, a lot of my friends enjoyed it, there are some good laughs and eye-candy. But if you want to laugh or feel heard as an angst-ridden teen I suggest: Animal House, With Honors, Pump Up the Volume or Ferris Bueller's Day off (Cameron provides the reality :)",,Anonymous,Music
Typical Teenage Movie,This is a good movie for those who are interested in mindless comedy. This is your typical X-Genereation movie.  In a time with nothing to fight for or nothing to beleive in teenagers turn to the only thing they can recognize. A music store run by an old hippie who  never bothered to grow up.  It deals with the things a new generation fights everyday.  I highly suggest this movie for everyone.  Just don't look for deep meaning or plot.  It isn't there but today there's deep left anymore.,,Anonymous,Music
bizarre,"This really is a bizarre beast of a movie.  some aspects of it are really really good, and others really really bad. It certainly gives the impression that the script aimed higher than tacky happy comedy, but the director/production company didn't. A friend of mine forced it on me as a tacky happy, but quite frankly, when one of the main characters tries to top herself, and cuts her hair off for attention then it really isn't all fun and games. It's worth watching, if only to appreciate the movie that it wanted to be, even if it didn't quite have the balls to be it. Definitely a good argument that scriptwriters should just to direct their own scripts.",,Anonymous,Music
A kind of dumb music movie that takes itself 2 seriously,"An independant music company called Empire Records is threatened to be changed into another music place. It's like a way stupider version of Barbershop with a record store.

Another thing that sucks about this movie is that it thinks of itself as being serious. It's not. Ok for an undemanding friday night. Starring Liv Tyler, Ethan Embry, Renee Zellweger, and others.

Among the Best,"Empire Records is among the best of the teenage movies.  It's realism and true-to-life situations allow people to relate.

Empire was packed full of pumpin' music and stereotypical characters, but also amazing actors and a unique style that will never be recaptured.  Lucas' odd philosophy, A.J.'s art,  Mark's brownies, Gina's ambitions, Corey's little blue skirt, and  Deb's neo-nazi boot camp makeover make movie fans come a-runnin' to the best movie I've have ever seen.",,Anonymous,Music

High Fidelity was a great film,"As a one time record store employee (Sam the Record Man in downtown Vancouver for those of you who were wondering) one of the many things I loved about ""High Fidelity"" was that people stopped comparing my store to ""Empire Records"".

empire rancid,"i understand that this movie has a lot of cult fanatics, and perhaps, if i was a bored, angst ridden teen with zero exposure to any other half decent film in 1995 (i was 22), i woulda loved it, but as it stands, i have a certain degree of taste and have seen several films, and i like to think i know what constitues good cinema, and this was far far far from good cinema. it was very self-consciously ""cute"", and self-congratulatory.  it was virtually plotless, felt like a sitcom, with one dimensional characters and tedious dance sequences to bad grungy mid-nineties rock.  it suddenly hit me that i was wasting my time watching this flick, so i promptly shut it off two thirds of the way in.  it was so smarmy and bland and the characters were so, ""lookit me, ma, i'm hip"".  i was really annoyed.  the rex character was interesting, and the bald chick had potential, but that's as far as it goes, really.  i agree with the others.  watch high fidelity, which is far more clever and interesting and well made.  it comes closer to art than this piece of bland mass entertainment.  i couldn't begin to describe the problems with this.  all i can really say is that the girl who lent this to me says it's her favourite movie and was insulted that i shut it off.  she also didn't appreciate ""my night at maud's"" (french intelligent filmmaking at it's close to finest).  what can i say.  different strokes for different folks.",,Anonymous,Music
definitely in my top 5,"Apart from the soundtrack being totally kick-butt, which it is, I really think that Empire is really like a High Fidelity for a younger audience.

What Teen Movies Should Strive To Be,"This movie is good.  Admittedly, it could've been better, but it's good. Unlike such other teen comedies such as Ten Things I Hate About You (which was really funnier than this movie) and Can't Hardly Wait (which was really a lot worse than this movie), it didn't have that make-ya-wanna-vomit ""I'm in love with you but you tell me that you don't love me at first but at the end you realize that you really do love me and we make-out"" plot.  Well actually it does, but at least this time it's just a 5 minute insignificant subplot (really, just 5 minutes).  What's good about this movie is that it doesn't try to have a deep plot, unlike other teen disasters (i.e. Suburbia).

MAYBE I'LL LIKE IT IN 10 YEARS,"A friend of mine randomly let me borrow this movie and I'd heard a lot about it as if it was some kind of cult, ground-breaking movie, so I was quite looking forward to watching it. Instead i was disappointed. The first major problem was the acting, which was, lets say, CRAP, too energetic and a hint of Brady Bunch! Especially at the beginning when you see everyone arriving at work at the same time all hyped up and dancing around the store like they have nothing better to do with their lives. It made me sick! Who the hell enjoys going to work that much?The film opens with one of the newest members (i presume) closing the store for the first time all by himself. He's given some simple rules: count the cash twice and don't touch Joe's (manager) beer or cigars. But being a 'teenager' in 1995, rules are made to be broken. The little bugger takes the money to a Casino to try his luck after discovering Empire Records is to be bought out. In his favour he strikes a 7 and wins but then he gets cocky and tries for another go. Guess what? He fluffs it! And that kick starts the basis of the plot that doesn't actually take off until halfway through the film. In between this we are introduced to the individual characters such as a couple of typical stoner metal-heads, the pretty-boy with a crush, the pure virgin, an attention-seeking little cow who has the world on her shoulders and symbolizes her anger by shaving her head and showing off a bandage on her wrist where she attempted suicide. DAMN RENEE ZELLWEGER'S POUTING LIPS! sorry.I can't really think what else there is to say about this film.

Cliched characters held me away.,"A friend of mine recommended that I watch this film so me and some other mates watched it.  I thought this was a bad movie and I wasn't going to write in about it but today I decided to check out other people's views. One person seemed to get it - LawnBoy 4 - but everybody else seemed to think it was some wonderful teenage rebellion movie.  I like a lot of teenage rebellion movies, Pump Up The Volume being one of my favs - by the same director, but I want to relate to the characters, or if not at least see some quality acting and direction.  In my opinion if you are going to introduce a straight A, Harvard-bound character who then turns 180 degrees to be revealed as a speed freak who throws herself at teen idols, then I would try to treat her with a little bit of understated reality based direction, try to make such a huge turn around seem possible.  These characters, especially Warren, got on my nerves.  The only people that I could relate them to are other characters from other similarly cliched films or even comic books.

Aside from that, its a good watch. Not as good as Can't Hardly Wait, but still great fun.The character of Lucas is brilliant, summoning superb one liners, and all the characters are crisp, with dialogue that sounds spoken rather than rehearsed, (for the most part)Part of the humour from me is that I KNOW people who are scarily close to these characters, but that may just be me.The music is good, the acting is perfectly good, the script is fun, and aside from the blatant Hollywood 'insert drama here' moments, all is well.See this film.",,Anonymous,Music
Pitch Perfect,"Empire Records is a gem among teen flicks for two reasons: cast and direction.First the cast - a real ensemble of actors with real credits and, in the case of the youngsters, real futures.  It took about five movies each before Liv Tyler or Renee Zellweger gave as much as they give in Empire!  Robin Tunney doesn't just appear in the movie with a shaved head - she cuts her hair on screen.  (You realize they had exactly one take.)  The kids interact believably and movingly.  LaPaglia and Cochrane are the anchors.  By the time the movie is over, you have a real sense of who Joe is, and if you're older than a teen, you probably know someone like him.The direction (and some of the writing) is deft.  Two or three things are usually happening at once, and are timed to peak in satisfying sequence.All of this sounds normal for a good quality grownup movie, but it is *so exceptional* for a ""teen flick.""  That's why Empire Records is a gem.This movie would make a great double bill with High Fidelity.",,Anonymous,Music

I hated everything about this film, from its title Empire Records (how pretentious is that title?) to its end credits, which were the only good thing about the movie.There are millions of people who love this idiotic film filled with stupid cheap and immature laughs......and I hate to think that those millions of people are the ones taking over the country one day.Which leads me to my next statement.......a person wrote that all people under 21 should see Empire Records......this person should be put on trial for trying to make the world ""dumb""....This movie is the kind of film everyone who watches Dawson's Creek like because its stupid, it has no moral, no story, no sense of humor, no right to be screened even to the dumbest people....This film would be ideal for torture, ten seconds of this and the prisoner would be in agony! They would be spilling their guts about everything....The acting is woeful, the humor is missing, the director is wanted for making a terrible film, the writers were babies, and the fans are simple minded.Empire Records is on the screen for about 90 minutes, and that's 90 minutes too long!",,Anonymous,Music
Simple and beautiful...,"This may not be the deepest movie, but it's still very entertaining. It's a sweet and funny story! The actors are great, and I would like to tribute Renee Zellweger. Splendid job. Once again she proves what a beautiful person she is in the way she interprets her characters. We love you Renee!",,Anonymous,Music
One of the Best Teen Movies,"Of all the teen crap the 90´s has producing, some of them are good, like Can´t Hardly Wait, Dazed and Confused and Empire Records. The soundtrack was inspiring, the characters were strong and with personality, and weren´t THAT stereotyped as in most teen films. I saw this one on HBO, and I expected it to be a major crap, but I found myself driven into a fun story and a movie that will tell future generations what was like the youth of the 90´s.",,Anonymous,Music
Slightly different slacker film,"This is a classic slacker film, but it is slightly different from other movies of the genre. Its unique fantasy sequences and fast pace separate it from the likes of ""Reality Bites"", ""The Breakfast Club"", ""Suburbia"", etc. The characters are memorable and, better yet, quotable. The chemistry between this group of actors makes the film special, especially the father-like relationship Manager Joe has with his troubled employees. One of the best films of the 90's.",,Anonymous,Music
Fun feel-good movie,Brilliant really made us laugh. Wicked soundtrack. Ok maybe not such a hot plot or storyline BUT WHO CARE's!. It's entertaining and funny and brightened up a sunday afternoon. Worth seeing just for Max Caulfields extremely cheesy performance and bad hair!,,Anonymous,Music
"yeah, it's bad, that's why it's good!","Empire Records came out when I was a freshman or sophomore in high school, and I remember thinking it was just the berries.  My friends and I would watch it almost every weekend, while smoking cigarettes and drinking mad dog.  The soundtrack and the film make me nostalgic, so maybe I am biased, but this is totally a great guilty pleasure movie.  It's bad, yes. But that's why it's so good!  People who are seeing it today as youngish-teenagers may think it's sooo dated, and it is (Liv Tyler's belly shirt and plaid kilt?  Please.), but for people in their young 20s, it's totally a great movie to rent with your friends.  Plus the soundtrack is pretty cool too in that mid-90s kind of way.",,Anonymous,Music
