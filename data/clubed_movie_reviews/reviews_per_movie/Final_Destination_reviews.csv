It's still a fun watch after two decades.,"Student Alex Browning is set to travel to Paris along with his classmates, before he gets on the plane he has a vivid premonition, and sees the plane destroyed, he and a few others get off the plane, but death has a plan already mapped out.I've always rated Final Destination as one of my favourite horrors, I think it scores incredibly highly in terms of originality, re-watching it now, I guess I find it a little corny, possibly not as good as I remember, but it still a fun watch.It holds up pretty well, it's straightforward to follow, unlike some of the movies in the genre today. I think it's worthy of a 7/10, it holds your interest.The special effects, for 2000 aren't bad at all, I think the plane sequences still look great, some of the accidents are perhaps a little less convincing.Devon Sawa is fine as Alex, he plays the part well, even if the character is a little irritating at times.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
My Daughter Will Not Watch This Before Flying...Lol,"Final Destination is an awesome movie full of fun jump scares and humourous 'accidents' which is exactly what you want in this type of movie.As there are half a dozen of these movies it does become a challenge to separate what deaths happen in each movie as they all blend together somewhat.Its targeted at a teen audience, in spite of that the film works for all age groups.

FINALLY! The first popcorn-tosser of the year!,"LOVED IT.Imagine any great slasher with no killer.  No person to blame, nobody to see and NO IDEA HOW THAT PERSON WILL DIE.  That's about the simple horror of Final Destination, and it was done in almost artistic ways.While many movie-makers have been unwilling or unable to get into the meat & potatoes behind a good R-rated movie, the creators of Final Destination have no such restraint.  In fact, the death scenes were so freakishly violent and intricate that they were interesting in and of themselves.  Imagine the force of death (not the Grim Reaper, but the ""phenomenon of accidents"", if you will) being MAJORLY p***ed for having missed a few.  Hence the plot.To make matters worse, the director displayed ""the little things"" hyper-accurately.  That alone made watching it really hard at times without wincing, flinching or screaming out loud.  (*those who have seen this know EXACTLY what I'm talking about*)As someone who goes to the movies every Friday, I have been waiting for this FOREVER!!Oh, and by movie, I mean MOVIE...  not FILM, not INDIE, not FLICK.  A MOVIE is something that I first hear of through word of mouth, first see a glimpse of via previews of another MOVIE, and, after seeing it, leave the theater flashing back through great scenes and lines for the next few hours saying to myself ""that was great!""Final Destination was a great movie.  They don't make them like this too often.Don't get me wrong, I'm sure if you were looking for flaws you could find them (no movie is perfect), but I wasn't and enjoyed my ride thoroughly as a result.  Personally, I think that if you had the time to pay attention to those flaws while watching it for the very first time, I've got news for you:  you missed a great movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Only ""bad"" movies dare to be this bold","It's not surprising that critics bashed this movie. In a movie review, most critics primarily value cohesion, refinement, calculated expertise; clearly that is not Final Destination.Much of the acting feels reminiscent of day-time TV shows. Lots of the dialogue is awkward, and contrived as ways to clarify plot points and move the story forward. The editing often fails to convey the right mood: seemingly dramatic moments coming off as humorous, humorous moments feeling at odds with the rising tension. In short, as with most teen horror flicks, this is not what most would consider a ""good"" movie.But something special can happen when a movie stops taking itself too seriously:Pure inventiveness.The idea that the ""killer"" can be the fabric of life itself, instilled in me a type of fear I'd never expected from a horror film. Everyday objects like kitchen appliances and fishing rods are now something to be feared; it leads to a sense that you can't trust any aspect of the seemingly mundane world around you.And though many of the deaths feel pretty ridiculous (though in incredibly entertaining ways), in a sense, they are also the most realistic deaths a horror movie could show. Freak accidents happen everyday. Most of us don't know how or when we're going to die; the world around you could be out to get you at any time. The fear comes through in the character's distrust in everyday life, and struggle against the inevitable.From this paranoia comes a fun and compelling story, one with unexpected turns around every corner as the characters fight against this unique existential threat.What Final Destination lacks in refinement, it makes up for in creativity and pure entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Thrilling with a creepy atmosphere. *** out of ****.,"FINAL DESTINATION / (2000) ***Starring: Devon Sawa, Ali Larter, Kerr Smith, Chad E. Donella, Amanda Detmer, and Kristen Cloke. Directed by James Wong. Written by Jeffrey Reddick, Glen Morgan and James Wong. Running time: 90 minutes. Rated R (for terror violence and language).I think it is safe to say every individual has different feelings about death. Some fear it. Others deny it. Most are weary in some way regarding decease. ""Final Destination"" is a perfect thriller for skeptics, detailing seven confused individuals who accidentally escape demise, discovering the impossibility of defrauding their destined time. The film's atmosphere provokes cringe through a presumably omnipresent force stalking the characters, producing audience participation whether the Grim Reaper is footsteps away from us all.Devon Sawa (""Idle Hands,"" ""Wild America"") is a high school senior named Alex Browning. He and his French class are at an airport flying to Paris for a field trip with their teacher, Ms. Lewton (Kristen Cloke). Once on the plane Alex begins to experience a dream-like vision of the jet exploding in midair killing all of its passengers. As the plane is about to descend, Alex notices his illusion gradually comes to life. This leaves him no choice but to cause a small riot leaving him and six other passengers thrown off the flight.Students Carter (Kerr Smith), the ignorant jerk and girlfriend Terry (Amanda Detmer), Alex's best friend, Tod (Chad E. Donella), other peers Billy (Seann William Scott), Clear (Ali Larter), Ms. Lewton and Alex watch from the airport as their late flight bursts into flames within minutes after takeoff-leaving these characters suspiciously confused about fate.The film wastes no time depicting its setup. The rushed opening leads to lack of character development. Whereas the character's personalities are clear, we feel little remorse for many of them. The dramatic premise is horrific and revealing, playing like an extended ""The X Files"" episode without paranormal detectives. ""Final Destination"" is creative and full of variety; we witness the plane crash from two different perspectives, as a passenger and an observer.Days after the crash, the survivors begin to die in unusual manners-almost as if a curse of death was placed on them for cheating demise. Alex digs deeper and discovers his companions are being killed by strange coincidences in the order they would have died from the explosion on the flight. In desperation, he attempts to contradict death for everyone remaining while under superstition of two disillusioned law enforcers.There are a few overlooked characters in ""Final Destination,"" mostly adults who seem to have an IQ score in the mid-nineties. The teenager's parents are left out most of the story. There is also a briefly creepy appearance by a mortician but is short-circuited by the plot. He is one of the many characters who end up explaining a lot of the plot to us.Most recent teen horror romps feature a madman chasing characters with sharp objects. ""Final Destination"" is too smart to fall in that clich√©, however. It has a punctual reason for inhabiting teens: these are young people full of energy and life, all the more reason for them to fight death.The film, written by Jeffrey Reddick, Glen Morgan and director James Wong, never explains why the Alex character has visions of upcoming disasters. The idea makes for an intriguing story, but there are no interesting subplots or side characters here. Therefore without being backed up by supporting stories the filmmakers must thoroughly justify the character's reason for being. Wong seems to overlook Alex's illusions, a concept holding the entire movie together.Although ""Final Destination"" provides many edge-of-your-seat surprises and tension, the film likes to poke fun at many of its scenes. Like the average teenage thriller, the movie takes itself seriously about three quarters of the time-leaving the last quarter as comic relief. Certainly having nothing against comedic sequences in horror flicks, I just prefer a movie true to its genre. Even though ""Final Destination"" is nowhere near perfect, it is the truest film to the teen slasher gender along time.""Final Destination"" is brought to you by New Line Cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
""" Fear cannot harm you, it is only the feeling one gets prior to it  occurring ""","There are a number of super talented actor/directors in Hollywood. One of the most prolific is James Wong. In this film which he not only wrote, but directed as well he displays what many would consider his best work to date. This is the story of Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) who accompanies his high school friends on a field trip to France. However, moments before the plane departs, Alex has a premonition the plane will explode in mid-air. Sensing he is about to die, he breaks for the exit in a violent plea to leave the aircraft. When he demands to be put off, several of his friends add to his fear by panicking. When they are asked to leave, they are held by the security police in the waiting area, where they all see the plane depart and then moments later explode in mid-air. There after things which should go better for him, having saved peoples lives, go terribly wrong. One by one all the people whom he saved begin to die mysteriously with Alex realizing he knows why. Death stalks everyone, but in this story, they are warned in advance. The movie has some horrific moments, which the audience senses become more pronounced as death arrives. Great acting by the cast makes this film a must see. ****",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Clever, perhaps even ingenious","The first Final Destination is recognized as somewhat of a classic in some circles, but for whatever reason doesn't seem to have been given its proper place in the pantheon. The idea for the story and the way it is executed, pun intended, is really clever, filled with diabolical humor and imagination. It's most ingenious device is making literally the entire world, from the most mundane object to the most innocuous event, into the ""monster.""",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"still a blast to watch, if even subtler than its sequels; Devon Sawa is young gold, characters you care about, and while not perfect, is worth its merit","The one that started it all: a franchise of over-the-top ""action,"" outrageous gore, and characters you often couldn't care less about. Yet in this one, none of those really apply. The death scenes are in ways subtle and clever, sometimes drawn out to exacerbate tension, while others are arguably very predictable, but nonetheless thrilling. The plane scene is chaotic and how it culminates, very intense. Aside from one decapitation, not much gore. Meanwhile the characters, in my opinion, are the best the series has had to offer, particularly thanks to Devon Sawa, and the personality he elicits in Alex Browning. Others satisfy, too, from Sean William Scott to Kerr Smith. There's some subtle humor, some drama, and some creativity to be had. As much praise as I have to offer the movie, it still has its many flaws and even silly moments. But for what it's worth, it was the beginning, and it remains a fun watch despite the slew of even more over-the-top installments that followed it.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Destination to death,"'Final Destination' is most notable for two things mainly. The first being that it was the introduction of a fascinating and clever premise that is pretty unique for a supernatural horror. The other being that it was the feature film directing debut of James Wong, best known beforehand as a veteran of 'The X Files'.It spawned four sequels with the fifth film being released in 2011. While it is flawed and somewhat of an uneven film, the first 'Final Destination' is still, six years after the fifth film, one of the franchise's better outings. Perhaps even the best, and the one where the premise feels the freshest. The more stale the concept got, the more the novelty wore off and the less effective the film. Could 'Final Destination' have executed its premise better? Perhaps. Mostly, to me, it did it quite well.Visually, 'Final Destination' looks pretty good for low budget. It's slickly shot and very atmospheric, while the plane effects in the Flight 180 plane scene/explosion are quite impressive. The music score has a suitable eeriness.The film is never dull and is a vast majority of the time fun and suspenseful, with elaborately creative death scenes that are ingeniously unsettling. The film's highlight is the opening Flight 180 scene, anyone already with a fear of flying will have their fear exemplified and it is likely to turn people from boarding a plane for a while. Wong does competently with the directing and the portrayal of Death is an interesting and well done one.Acting varies, with personable Devon Sawa, affecting Ali Larter and Tony Todd's creepy cameo coming off best. Really liked the characters' surnames, that were nifty homages to horror/suspense icons.Not all the acting works however. The others are saddled with one-dimensional and flatly written roles and are a mix of bland (Kristen Cloke) and irritating (Kerr Smith), also found myself not being able to take Seann William Scott seriously.The biggest issue is the script, which is very high in the cheese and awkwardness factors and there is some clumsy exposition that often feels under-explored and not really going anywhere. Generally the story is nice, but things could have been explained better and explored more and it's a little too reliant on coincidence. Things also take a dumb turn towards the end before the film concludes on a logic-defying note.Overall, patchy but entertaining. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Finally a horror film worth a lot of Praise!,"Final Destination has made my list as one of the best horror films in the wake of the teen/slasher revival. in fact it's the most original horror film since the original Scream and it may be better than Scream. There have been many cheap imitations(Urban Legend, i still know what you did last summer, etc) but this one is a keeper.The film begins with the most exhillerating 15 minutes in recent memory(and if you're afraid of flying be prepared to be shocked). Alex browning(Devon Sawa) is getting ready to leave on a class trip to France. while on the plane he has a vision that the plan is going to explode. Later he awakes from this vison and immediately he goes crazy telling everyone the plane is going to explode. eventually 6 students and alex leave the plane and sure enough moments after the plane takes off it explodes. This is where the story gets interesting by getting off the plane Alex soon realizes that him and his friends have cheated Death and they have to figure out when death is coming back at them.The one thing i thought was trully good about this film was whenever ""Death"" came after the remaining students that got off the plane it wasn't some grim reaper type guy you could see. whenever death was around it was very subtle. shadows, wind, etc. death never showed his ugly head. he used everyday thingst o kill his victims. in fact it was stuff that you could accidentally do in your home and that is what makes this film scary.The acting is great. Devon Sawa proves that he can carry a film. he has great talent. Ali Larter is a terrific actress who is well on her way to becoming the best actress ofher generation, but Kerr smith of dawson's Creek shines here. he was really good and i hope to see him in more films.Great film worth every dollar i spent to see it. 10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Teen Movie Only! - Story that lacks depth,"I originally sought out the movie because of the James Wong/X-Files link. I was hoping for some thought provoking movie  in the Horror Genre. But I was disappointed. The story lacks depth. Its essentially a bunch of teens running around getting bumped off. Does that sound familiar? On the plus side - the start was great. After the first 15 minutes, I was left wondering where could it go after this? Unfortunately it went to exactly the same place as the movie ""scream""! I thought it was a great movie to look at and the acting was good, it was just the story that was lacking. I would recommend the movie if your are into teen movies or if you are a ""teen"".

This isn't bad for a teenage 'horror' movie,"The past years there has been a real boom of teenage horror movies and thrillers. Just think of 'Scream', 'I know what you did last summer',...This one is good, but not very special. We see a class preparing to go on a field trip to Paris. One of the students gets a vision of the airplane exploding, killing everybody inside. He escapes together with a teacher and some other students. But crossing Death's plans doesn't mean that they will stay alive. One by one they get killed in the most incredible ways.And that is where, in my opinion, the biggest weakness of this movie lies. The ways they die are so incredible. If this had been a comedy, I wouldn't mind, but now they want to be taken serious and that is where they fail. That doesn't mean that I don't like the movie at all, but it will never be one of my favorites. I give it a 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Scared Me Good,"I have to admit that when I first saw the previews for Final Destination, I didn't think much.  But after reading several reviews that said how good it was, I thought about seeing it, but couldn't because of a busy year.The story is about a kid named Alex(Devon Sawa) who just so happens to have a fear of flying.  With a class of 49 students, they are going to France on a field trip.  When Alex has a horrific premonition about dying in plane crash, he freaks out and is kicked off the plane with five other students and teacher.  Minutes after getting kicked off, and Alex is calm, the unexpected happens, the plane actually does explode.Over the next few weeks, however, teachers, the survivors, as well as the police become increasingly suspicious of Alex.  Some of his friends even think of him as a god.  Anyway, the survivors of the plane crash soon begin dying in gruesome and sometimes horrific fashions.  Alex soon discovers that by getting off the ill-fated flight, that he had intervened with Death's predetermined pattern.  Death, however, has made a new pattern and Alex must find out what it is to save his friends as well as himself.I have to say that this movie scared me and my parents good.  I also must say that this film deserves a lot praise.  Although the plot is not original, however the antagonist is, Death itself.  What I really liked about it was that Death never showed itself and that it turned simple everyday items into murder weapons.Of course no horror movie is perfect.  There is one beef I do have with Final Destination.  Some of the death scenes are pretty creative and terrifying, but some of them seemed to have been forced.  I mean who is going to place a beverage on top of a computer monitor?Other than this one minor flaw, Final Destination is still a great and scary horror film.8/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Appalling, Abysmal, Ridiculous, Pathetic...","This movie has to be the most disappointing of the year. I don't understand how people have claimed that it is even remotely original or interesting. The entire film is packed to the brim with the traditional ""horror-movie"" cliches, such as the curtains blowing in the wind and the strikes of lightning occurring every time something bad is about to happen. Not only that, but each death becomes more and more predictable as the film progresses, and by the time Billy was randomly decapitated by a piece of metal sent flying by a train, I was just laughing. The only commendable aspect of the whole saga was that the enemy, Death, was never visible, although whenever he was about to strike, there would be a lamentably stereotypical shadow cast across the room. Not even the plane crash was remotely scary, and the actors showed very little emotion about the fact that 50 of their classmates had just been killed in a mile-high fireball. Several killings were unbelievably improbable, such as Todd's ""suicide"" in the bath, Terry's collision with the bus (which I cannot believe nobody saw coming), and the electrocution and train scenes, where, amazingly, Alex manages to cheat Death. For a film which was supposed to promote the idea that Death is unavoidable, ""Final Destination"" has an abysmally happy ending. The cherry on the cake though, was seeing Tony Todd in cameo role as the morgue attendant who tells Alex, ""I'll be seeing you soon."" Worth seeing so that you can spend a couple of hours mocking every aspect, but this movie can't really score more than a 4.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Interesting original concept,Alex (Devon Sawa) is going to France on a school trip. He falls asleep and has a vivid dream where everyone dies in a fiery crash. It's so vivid that he freaks out and gets thrown off the plane with many of his fellow students. The plane actually explodes and those people seem to escape death. Only something is hunting them down one at a time.It's a great original concept. However it doesn't lend itself to being filmed in a compelling way. Basically weird things happen and everybody dies. There isn't a crazy manic. The kids aren't trying to outrun somebody. Death is invisible. That's the whole point. It's just one weird death after another. There's something much more visceral about an axe murderer gutting his young nubile victims.,6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Quite good for a teen slasher flick,"I really liked this movie. It's probably one of the better teen slasher flicks to ever hit the screen.Let's face it: teen slasher flicks are not outstanding cinema. The writing is always lame, the plots are even lamer, they're usually vehicles for the latest trends in fashion and music and showcases of the heartthrob and/or bombshell-of-the-month. They're really just vehicles for post-pubescent hormonal stimulation.But ""Final Destination"" is different. First, it has real imagination going for it. The plot is unlike your typical ""madman in the corn chases teenage bombshell through puddles,"" it actually took some thought to put this together. It's not just shock-factor movie-making, they actually sat down and outlines how all the deaths would work in a way that keeps the plot alive. A tale of kids trying to cheat death's design is much harder to write than a dude with a chainsaw.Then there's the death scenes themselves. Outstanding! I love a clever death scene in movies like this ... it's why you pay the $8! And these are some doozies. You can tell the filmmakers sat around for hours simply trying to find the coolest way to kill people. And if you have a sick mind (like yours truly), you'll find these death scenes simply hysterical! A really good movie. 8 out of 10.

Surprisingly Entertaining And Tense - With A Great Side Performance From Tony Todd,"Pros:
1. Despite the overall ridiculousness of the plot, the subject of death is deftly and intimately handled.
2. The practical effects are really impressive and they really help to bring the spectre of death to life, ironically.
3. Devon Sawa (Alex Browning) gives a really good performance.
4. Tony Todd (Bludworth) delivers an incredibly sinister and mesmerising side performance.
5. The gore and violence is brutal, unforgiving and uncomfortable which serves up some gnarly and unforgettable deaths.
6. The tension and suspense is built magnificently via the well-timed close-ups and the slow zoom-ins.
7. The film serves as good commentary on the unpredictability and relentlessness of death, as well as the fact that living just to survive is no way to live, especially as death will get you anyway.Cons:
1. At times, the sound-mixing is distractingly delayed.
2. Somehow none of the characters heard or saw the bus that ended up hitting Terry Chaney (Amanda Detmer) before impact.
3. The special effects, unsurprisingly, look a little dated.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
utterly worthless,"the whole final destination series has one message. If you can save someone's life, don't bother, cause it will just throw off death's design. Then you will be targeted by death. The moral of the story is don't get involved. The entire Final Destination series is as low as the horror film genre can go. Once again, we have several talented actors wasting away in this in cohesive implausible, and totally worthless pieces of fluff. As with the second one, the directors decided they wanted to come up with some of the most impossible, and in some cases, unnessaryily goreish, ways to kill people off. The whole premise of the series is weak, and rather offensive. The lowest of any horror film series, only watch if you want to see how over the top a horror film can be.

"Starts very well, but gets a little too silly toward the end.","A minor SPOILER here.A very good premise that gradually - and inevitably - drifts into teen horror film territory. I say inevitably because there is a group of teens involved so obviously there can be no long-term seriousness. Still, I was a little surprised just how unseriously the movie ends. When one compares the excellent beginning with the ridiculous horror/comedy ending, it is like looking at two different movies. It's a pity that the premise wasn't taken and ""assigned"" to a cast of adults, i.e. that a ""serious"" horror film wasn't made. Nevertheless, FD is never dull; even the obviously weaker second half. The flight disaster scenes are terrific, the murder scenes are very good, and there is real interest as to what is going to happen next, in spite of a premonition that the conclusion can't and won't be satisfactory. The conclusion is almost like a mockery of all the previous happenings (the movie turns from horror into the horror comedy genre). Easily the dumbest scene, however, isn't the ending but the way the aggressive teen turns around his car to beat up the movie's main hero, and nearly kills the bicycle-driving teen - while completely ignoring the fact that he nearly killed him and caused an accident!

Death's Design,"Final Destination is a clever and engaging horror film that stands out for its inventive premise and its ability to turn everyday scenarios into nerve-wracking encounters with fate. Directed by James Wong, the movie offers a fresh twist on the slasher genre by replacing the traditional masked killer with an unseen, unstoppable force-Death itself. The result is a suspenseful, sometimes darkly humorous exploration of inevitability and the futility of trying to escape fate.The story begins with a chilling sequence in which a group of teens, led by Alex Browning (Devon Sawa), narrowly avoid dying in a plane crash after Alex has a premonition of the disaster. What follows is a tense, escalating series of events as Death methodically tracks down the survivors, delivering elaborate and often shocking ""accidents"" to reclaim its due. The film's central conceit-Death as an unseen but omnipresent antagonist-keeps the tension high and allows for a series of inventive and memorable set pieces.The death sequences are the film's highlight, showcasing a mix of creativity, tension, and macabre humour. Everyday objects and scenarios are transformed into harbingers of doom, keeping the audience guessing about how each character will meet their end. This element of unpredictability is one of the film's greatest strengths, making even mundane moments feel charged with dread.The characters, while not particularly deep, serve their purpose in driving the narrative. Devon Sawa delivers a solid performance as the paranoid and determined Alex, while Ali Larter adds emotional weight as Clear Rivers, a fellow survivor grappling with the concept of destiny. Though the cast largely adheres to typical teen horror archetypes, their chemistry and genuine reactions help maintain the film's suspense.While the premise is undeniably intriguing, the film occasionally struggles to sustain its momentum. The middle act can feel repetitive as the survivors try to decipher Death's ""plan"" and avoid their fates, and the philosophical questions raised by the plot-about fate, free will, and mortality-are only superficially explored.Despite these minor shortcomings, Final Destination remains an entertaining and memorable entry in the horror genre. Its unique approach, combined with its suspenseful pacing and inventive death scenes, makes it a standout film that spawned a successful franchise.In conclusion, Final Destination is a gripping and fun watch for horror fans, offering a fresh take on the genre with its creative concept and execution. While it may not delve deeply into its themes, it succeeds as a thrilling, edge-of-your-seat experience that keeps audiences hooked until the very end.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bus scene,The bus scene makes watching this movie worth your while. It's about 1.5 seconds long. Nothing much else to say about the movie. It's just another teen horror without much play on the supernatural. Some of the scenes are actually very well acted.,6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Final Destination: 8/10,"When you go to watch a movie like Final Destination, which is obviously a teen horror movie, you take your chances. You could get something genuinely creepy yet tongue-in-cheek, like Scream, or you could wind up seeing something like Darkness Falls or They. You just never know. When Final Destination came up on my Netflix list, I didn't know what to expect. Would it be something original and scary, or just some lame dud? Thankfully, it turned out to be the former.Alex (Devon Sawa), along with about 40 others, are all set to take off on a plane destined for their senior trip in France. Right before it is set to take off, however, he has a premonition that shows him that soon after takeoff the plane will crash and everyone on board will be dead. He and others are forced off of the plane, and, sure enough, the plane crashes with everyone else on board. While everyone thinks that Alex caused the accident, he knows that they were supposed to die on board. Soon, everyone who was supposed to be on the plane start dying one by one.Knowing that this was written and directed by the same team who did Willard, I knew that a lot of the movie wouldn't be just needless blood, but that there would be some sort of a creepy atmosphere to it all. And, by gum, there was. Although it wasn't as atmospheric as the aforementioned movie, and it relied a lot on sudden violence, it was still creepy. It seems like horror movies today rely on quick jumps to scare the audience. Final Destination sure had some, but also the music and the general movie itself was thrilling. When you could see that something was going to happen, you wanted to yell at the character to not do so-and-so. Then you sit back and enjoy the ride.Something else that surprised me was how many special effects were needed. That was one major drawback. At times, the special effects didn't look real AT ALL (re: the bathroom scene), or there were too many when less is more (re: the final, climactic storm). One other thing that upset me was the constant need to do odd lighting. Because of the off-again, on-again lighting, it's sometimes impossible to tell what's happening. In Final Destination's pursuit to become something ultra-modern, nifty camera movements are tried, but for the unnecessary reasons. For example, a long, overhead tracking shot is used when two people are going to the bathroom. Very unnecessary, if you ask me. I just realized how much Glen Morgan and James Wong are fascinated with people going to the bathroom. There must be a few scenes of that in Final Destination, and one quite humorous one in WillardI also thought that the movie took too long to get started. We understand that Alex will see the plane crashing, but for about the first half hour that's all that's `implied'. It's very annoying. Thankfully, the characters aren't as stupid as they usually are in teen horror movies, and I did like all of the talk about `death's pattern', etc. Overall, get on board to Final Destination and it won't crash.My rating: 8/10Rated R for violence and terror, and for language.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great concept,"Final Destination was really the first horror movie I got really fascinated with as a kind. Death as an entity coming to get you, you can't stop it, you can't see it, you can't hide from it. To me it is really one of the scariest movie villains put to screen.That it came about as a discarded X-Files episode is really special and the influence of the show is very much felt in this first instalment. (There are two inspectors trying to figure out the strange deaths). A dark, philosophically twisted way to tell the audience that death could be around any corner. That today the set of events could have been set in motion that makes you meet your demise.The characters trying to escape that feels like they are escaping their destiny. What has been planned for them. They are desperate to take control over this part of their life, an analogy for staying alive against all the odds that life itself can throw at you. Alas, it is a bit held down by mediocre acting.But, to me, it is a great horror movie with a novel, interesting concept that death can put in motion a Goldberg-machine like set of events that can kill someone in a bizarre accident.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
This has to be one of the most terrible horror movies I've ever seen,"This movie is completely ridiculous. The premise, that people can cheat death but then be fated to die, is not bad. But the execution on the movie is so terrible that it becomes comical and lame. The buildup to before the plane crashes is long, drawn out, and overdone. And that's not even the worst thing about the movie. Each death scene shows a person doing regular activities, and they focus on about 17 different ways that person could die, until finally, after a ridiculous long amount of time, the person dies in the most completely impossible and stupid manner you could imagine. And not only that, the dialogue falls flat on the floor. There's nothing about the movie that even makes you remotely care about whether any of the characters live or die. I would expect better out of a high school project. I won't describe any of the death scenes in case you actually want to watch it, but my advice is: DON'T. I've seen a lot of horror movies, and this is probably in the bottom 3.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Creepy and Real,"This movie was frightening for one simple reason, it isn't afraid to go the route of talking about death, fate and if the inevitable is really unavoidable or if deaths plan can be fathomed and subsequently outwitted.

Thought the story is a little contrived and a bit predictable(though that is part of the story) the effect is still the same. The movie is not, despite what you may hear, a teen flick, if you're a horror fan from any generation trust me you'll like it as long as you go in wanting to see it and willing to actually think about the film and follow the story line.

Although at end the story loses interest and is quite predictable.A group of students are in an airplane (go to Paris), but then one of them has one vision that saves his life and the life of some of his companions, and those visions continued in all the story with more or less fortune.Definitively one film more of adolescent terror, but something different, that at least it does not try to do that you laugh, nor presents the deaths like something graceful.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Innovative premise for a 'Dead Teenager Movie,' but the last act isn't compelling","This first ""Final Destination"" movie from 2000 was a rather innovative 'Dead Teenager Movie' in that the killer was Death itself, the Grim Reaper. A group of people escape a great tragedy due to a premonition of one of them and the rest of the movie involves the Grim Reaper systematically slaying those who cheated Death in various creative ways. The opening tragedy in this case is a plane crash; in the second film it's a horrible highway pile-up; in the third it's a roller-coaster mishap and so on.I've seen all five of the currently five-film franchise, but they each tell the same basic story with different characters and a different location and are all of the same high quality of filmmaking, technically speaking. Whether you prefer one or another depends on whether you like the cast and the death sequences (and the locations) because, other than these factors, they're all basically the same.This first one has a quality heroine or 'final girl' in Ali Larter. Amanda Detmer is also on hand as a fellow student while Kristen Cloke plays a freaked-out teacher. They coulda done better showcasing these women IMHO. On the opposite side of the gender spectrum there's Devon Sawa, Kerr Smith, Seann William Scott and Chad Donella. Their importance to the story is in that order. Meanwhile Tony Todd makes his first of four appearances in the series as a mortician who curiously knows more than he should.For me, what makes these movies kinda dull is the fact that it's impossible to cheat Death. Sure, you can escape it here or there, but Death's been in business for millennia and expertly knows what he's doing. As such, everyone's gonna die except maybe the 'final girl,' who will most certainly die in the sequel.The script began as an X-Files teleplay and, indeed, the movie was made by two veterans of that series. And you can tell due to the basic feel of the movie and the inclusion of two government agents. I'd give ""Final Destination"" a higher grade because I love the concept, but this one curiously gets dull in the final act (despite all the 'exciting' things going on) and they coulda done more with the women.The film runs 1 hour, 37 minutes and was shot in the Vancouver, British Columbia, area (although the events take place around New York City).GRADE: B- (6.5/10)",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Is Carter bipolar?,"'Final Destination' certainly has an interesting topic, but how it is developed is incompetent. Most importantly, characters' emotions fluctuate from zero to infinity. For even one second, I cannot emphasize or at least understand why Carter is angry, why he's fighting Alex so suddenly, why he feels rebellious to the extent of suicide, and why he becomes best friends with Alex to save him. Alex and Clear never talked for four years of high school, and after the plane crash they become love of each other's life the next day. Even though we consider the fact that they are teenagers, emotional flow is illogical and messy as heck, and 'Final Destination' loses grip along the way.

Good idea gone wrong,"The basic plot is a very good and scary one, but the film is so-so. Which is sad, because I can imagine great dialogues, great scenes and a better ending with, for example, M. Night Shyamalan or someone else better suited for this type of film at the wheel. As it is, what is a very novel and good idea is turned into a shake 'n' bake teen horror popcorn flick, good for a 14"" screen on a slow Saturday night. It wears itself out pretty quickly and the point of the film, which could have been very imaginative, is focused on killing off the kids as quickly and as haphazardly as possible. The funniest thing is that the story has perfect logic and sense, but the makers have overlooked it and done a slipshod job. I'm sorry they did. It could have been great.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
What if you could predict your death? Would you prevent it or let it come?,"I finally decided to give the Final Destination movies a chance, I didn't want to see them when they were released because of the actors, just a bunch of Dawson Creek teen drama TV actors, and I figured the movie would probably suck or be a Scream rip off. But today I decided that maybe I should give these movies a chance, I heard from a couple people that they were pretty good. I apologize to the writers and director of Final Destination, because this was one of the better horror movies I have seen in a while.Basically, Alex and his fellow students, including four teachers, are going on a field trip to Paris, but Alex has a horrifying nightmare of the plane crashing horribly and exploding killing everyone. Right before they take off, he screams and tells people to get off, but only 6 follow him, one of which is in a fight with him, one of which believes him, one of which who was late for the flight, one of which was a teacher comforting him, one of which was his best friend, and one of which is the girlfriend of the guy who is in a fight with Alex. The plane explodes, killing everyone, thinking they're safe, Alex realizes that they were meant for death and it has a pattern, but it's a matter of playing Death!Final Destination is original and a terrifying story that brings up the interesting subject of fate and destiny and if you make it or things should happen naturally.

Ridiculous,Actually the first scenes on the airplane and in the airport had me drawn into the movie. The movie goes straight downhill into overkill after that.

death like time has got its own plans,"Without being an absolute masterpiece, ""Final Destination"" is a good fantastic movie that deserves to be watched. It borrows several elements from other movies or novels such as ""Scream"" or ""And then there were none"" but it exploits them very well. And this is helped thanks to a clever script that includes a few qualities, notably this one: we can't really see death but we can feel its presence and its cleverness. Moreover, the suspense is well lead during all the movie until the end.But if ""Final Destination"" isn't a masterpiece, it's because it also contains faults: for example, how can Alex, the hero of the film succeed in seeing these odd visions about ""accidents that are going to happen""? Then, he doesn't get on well with one of the main characters (you can consider him as his worst enemy) and however they'll be compelled to help each other in order to escape from death. You could also say that certain sequences are predictable while some are on the verge of unlikely.Nonetheless, a rather good fantastic movie.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Neat concept, so-so realization",I really like that this is a teenage slasher flick in which there is neither a personified villain nor much moralizing around the deaths. I really like that death is just a force in this film and I'm glad the film skips over say the girl who had sex being killed first trope. It is a refreshing take on a horror thriller. The deaths in this one are fairly realistic-sans the final sequence-and it is not as funny as the later films are.That said the acting and especially the characterizations are very weak.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Butler, PA","Around the time of Final Destinations production, teen slasher films were very popular.  The film was made to capitalize on that fleeting market, but I've have to give recognition to the writers and director for trying something a little bit different, at least for the time period in which it was made.  James Wong did a good job directing.  His style is far from innovative, but it provides the film with a nice tone.  The screenplay could have went better.  Though better than an average example, FD still suffers from lack of character developement and some mediocre dialogue.  There are far worse examples in the genre, though.  The acting was also good.  Ali Larter was the only one I really didn't care for.  She just seemed rather uninterested in what she was doing.  There really wasn't that many parts I found to be particularly suspenseful or scary, though they will keep you from slipping off into boredom.  The final 15 minutes or so was also rather dull.A good example of later teen horror films.  There are evident negative elements, but there are some good ones too.  If you don't take yourself too seriously, you should find it at least decent.6.5/10* * 1/2/ * * * *",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Better than average, that's about it: 6/10","The downfall of this movie begins when two of the teenagers break into a morgue to visit the corpse of a dead friend. They are met there by a really bad plot device in the guise of a mortician. Morticians are expected to have coarsened sensibilities due to working alongside death every day and maybe a little eccentric as well, but this one is way over the top. Of course, he's not there as a real character but rather as a means to give away the plot along with any lingering mystery still contained in the movie. How he knows what he knows we dare not ask, we're just supposed to accept that someone who deals with corpses on a regular basis has a deep metaphysical insight into how death operates. Not only that, he also knows the precise predicament that the teenagers are in even though he's never met them. His only real function is to trim some time from the movie's length so that the real characters don't have to expend any excess energy discovering what they're up against.     I guess the other thing I didn't like about the movie was the ""teenage twist"" factor contained in the movie's ending. You know how it goes: the supernatural or fate, in this case, must play by certain rules so that the movie will seem more like a game to the target audience, mainly teenagers. But rules are kind of constraining and predictable, even to teenagers, so the movie sets up a false ending that's not really the ending because there's one more act to the game before it's over. Most recently the movie ""The Ring"" did this false ending along with countless others before it.To be honest, the movie overall is inferior to a decent X-Files episode. For example, the FBI agents just do not command respect; somehow they lack the deadly seriousness portrayed so well in that series. The victims in the movie are dispatched in particularly gruesome ways and although some are very effective in jolting the viewer it does give one the feeling you're watching a teen slasher movie with an invisible diabolical John Denver working in place of Freddy or Jason. I'm really kind of disappointed that Morgan and Wong didn't do a better job given their extensive background with the X-Files.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Clever, highly self-referential","This is a clever little movie.I'm 53, and go to see teen movies out of curiousity and to try to stay tuned to a quickly evolving, often intriguing culture.

I know that there are many who would go looking to be scared, who would take this movie (or any one) seriously -- folks who even rank grossness as a thrill.But this movie is like the first Scream movies in making fun not at slasher flicks, but at the people who come to see slasher picks, or more precisely, the reasons they do. However, this movie does so much better than scream because it uses a novel device: many of the deaths are extremely complex sequences of improbable coincidences.It fits with the story, as only death could string these together. But it provides what Scream lacked: a greater distance from the actual slash. In fact this movie is NOT scary, nor gory by current standards. Instead, it spends its time on introspection about the medium. Andy Warhol sophistication finally hits teen culture. The level of this humor gives me hope about the future of the minds of our kids.I only wonder what can come of it next. If every instance of distance requires that we carry the vulgar with it as referent, does this give new life to the base?",,Anonymous,Horror

Granted, the basic premise of the film is fantastic, and unusually original in this genre, but the script is absolutely terrible.For example, without spoiling the 'plot', the complete pattern is worked out after just one incident: now I may be wrong, but I think a pattern is defined as a series of events linked in some way. From that point on the dialogue was awful, the supposed 'make you jump' moments may as well have had an on-screen countdown they were so obvious, and the film became overwhelmed in sheer banality.The ending did give a little bit of interest, until you realise that it leaves the door open for a sequel, at which point you just wonder...why?Only rent this film if you are extremely bored or hung over.The John Denver music was in there due to the 'ironic' fact that he died in a plane crash.3/10",,Anonymous,Horror

You could tell that the whole cinema was visibly shocked after this. Also, the subsequent deaths occurred as accidents which could happen to any of us!!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Gives us something to think about,"Normally, I'm not spooked by a film but this movie sure as hell gave me the chills.'Final Destination' was a taut, sharp and intelligent piece of horror, not reliant on that many gore effects for shocks. Indeed the films horror was based on a good use of suspense rather than out-and-out gore. I've got to admit, some deaths came out of nowhere and those who did die, died in less obvious ways than you may have thought of.It gave us mere mortals something to think about too, in that (a)I'm not flying again for a long time and (b) death is not an accident but is planned so that when your time comes, you can do absolutely nothing about it. You can only cheat death temporarily. It'll get you in the end, by any means necessary no matter what plans you have made to avoid it. Morbid to be honest, but entirely true.The downside to this movie was the confusing explanation of how the pattern of 'Death' was explained. It lost me. Can someone explain. It seems as though the writers became stuck for an explanation as to how 'Death' moved from victim to victim and thought hey this'll do for now.This is only a minor quibble about a very good movie. I haven't seen an intelligent horror film like this since. Well, since. Good use of horror movie in-jokes too. I love the use of using surnames of horror directors and actors as character names. Some were obvious (Hitchcock, Lewton), some less so (Waggner, Schreck).Highly recommended but not a date movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A film adaptation of the board game, Mouse Trap.","Apparently the screen writers in charge of this script were highly influenced by the popular children's board game, Mouse Trap.  You know, where someone turns the crank which makes the stop sign hit the boot which kicks the bucket causing the ball to roll down the stairs, hitting the hand that drops the ball into the tub which falls on the see-saw making the man flip into the pool which drops the net on the mice.  Only in this film someone makes the stop sign swing a little to hard causing really bizarre thing like explosions, impaling, and black 'water' to come out of your toilet all resulting in someone's death.  The plot was...well...pretty typical.  The only really unique thing about this thriller is the fact that every sort of happens via ridiculous chain-reactions.  If you're looking for a good teeny-bopper thriller/horror flick ( like one of those even exists)...avoid looking here.  If you've ever played Mouse Trap, you've already seen this movie and honestly, the game is more realistic and entertaining.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Very unique concept with lots of ""cool"" death sequences. I love the franchise.","I first saw this in 2001 on a TV channel. Cant remember whether it was hbo or local cable. Was very eager to watch this. By this time the VHS business had already closed in mumbai. The Lcd n vcd were total flop. Had seen n enjoyed all its sequels, especially the 5th part. Revisited the 1st recently on a DVD. I own all the parts. The plot of this movie was very refreshing n intriguing. A bunch of teens r heading off on a school trip n one of the fella falls asleep and has a bad dream/premonition that the plane they are on will explode just after it leaves the runway, mercilessly killing everyone on board. The fella causes a ruckus n is removed from the plane along with few others. Weirdly, the said plane does explode n as the tag line of the film says, u cant cheat death. The survivors r later followed by a sinister dark shadow.... The tension n suspense is maintained throughout. Very original concept. The writing is really unique. The gore and death scenes are really intense. The deaths are impressively choreographed, occasionally funny and liberally bloody. The acting is decent. The effects are done to great effect. There are some terrific scares here.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Enjoyable and tense horror/thriller,"Waiting for the plane to take off for his high school trip to France, Alex has a vision of the plane exploding.  He panics and is removed from the plane along with several of his party.  As they argue in the terminal the plane explodes leaving them as the sole survivors and the FBI investigating how they knew.  When one of the number, Todd is killed, Alex realises that they have not cheated death and that the reaper is returning for them in turn.When I originally saw this film I was not that taken with it, however seeing the sequel made me realise just how superior to that, the original was.  The plot, taken from an X-Files idea is quite clever and originally worked out throughout the film.  Each death (or potential death) is shocking or tense or exciting, there is little of the obscene cruelty that exists within the sequel.  Here the characters are just a little more than meat to be sliced and diced in fancy manners.The cast are reasonably good.  Many are simply student clich√©s who have their time counted down.  Not knowing who was famous and who wasn't here I didn't know who would live and who would die and it made it quite exciting. Sawa leads the cast well and is a good character ¬ñ his madness in the cabin is worth seeing.  Todd (Candyman himself) makes a brief cameo that helps the film and is nicely creepy and trashy at the same time.Overall this is an enjoyable trashy film that has gore and suspense and is enjoyable to watch.  The sequel was simply excessive death scenes and you'd do well to enjoy this film and ignore it's follow up.",,Anonymous,Horror

It was...ok.,"I thought the movie started off great and declined as the movie went on. They really had a good idea going, but messed it up if you ask me.  I wasn't too fond of most of the cheesy deaths  (typical lame horror movie deaths). There were a lot of things that I thought would be developed, but they weren't.  ""Final Destination"" definitely had it's share of plot holes.  How does this ""cheat death"" premise ever end?  I wasn't all too fond of the ending either.  Over all, I give it a 7 of 10.

"Wow, Hollyweird can be original???!!","The first instalment of this ever so cool franchise. Although i find this the weakest one of the lot it still is very cool and stars the seldom seen underrated actor Devon sawa. These movies in this film have such an intense yet true story to tell. You cant cheat death, when its your time its your time and there is nothing you can do about it. When horror/thrillers were at there all time low (god they are doing this storyline again?) out came this film by director James Wong , an original idea something Hollyweird has been lacking of for the last 10 or so years. This original instalment has a school trip to Paris France , all the students are boarding and getting their seats when young Alex Browning drifts off and has a scary but unseemingly real dream that the plane is going to explode he and a few people who are either caught in his paranoia or believe him get escorted off the plane as to which they all watch in terror as the plane explodes just after take off. Did Alex save them? Maybe for now however the moral of these films and the story here is when your time is up your time is up.

treasure every step,"The night before i viewed this film, i watched the latest final destination, the 2009 version. While that one was your typical , god damn awful teen horror flick, the original has more going for it and is packed with entertainment value.First of all, the characters aren't wooden. None of them come out with any ridiculous one liners like they did in the 2009 film. All the actors played there part well. The only problem with the characters was that not one of them was likable. Even though the plot is similar to the latest version, this one doesn't seem to be to much over the top. When i say this i mean that the deaths aren't far fetch and aren't only use to portray the gore element of the film like in the latest version. In the original, the deaths are believable while at the same time there filled with gore.The opening of this movie is great. the airport scene is filmed great and the special effects are brilliant. i don't know anyone who would turn the film off after the first 20 Min's. For once in the genre, the film gives an great script, good acting, original plot. This film rises above the rest within the teen horror genre. The only negative is that the ending is totally predictable, it quite easy to spot the characters making the mistake in there judgement.

Essentially a standard slasher movie that has been given a supernatural twist, there's enjoyment to be had as long as you don't think too hard.

A good premise is squandered by stupid teen clich√©'s,"The idea of cheating death, and then having death itself 'chase' you until the only conclusion ensues is a frightening one, and a really great premise for a horror movie. Death is the ultimate unknown and the idea of it being a malicious presence should give way to a classic horror movie. However, anything that should have been good about this movie isn't, and unfortunately it ends up being another teen slasher, just with an invisible killer instead of some goon in a mask. After a relatively decent start, the movie descends into a routine, clich√© ridden, teen horror movie with not an interesting character nor a frightening scenario in sight. The story follows a group of teenagers and their teacher (also a teenager) that survive a plane crash after one of them has a premonition and gets himself thrown off the plane. What then follows is a series of over the top death scenes intertwined with a boring 'investigation'.It's a shame that this film is rubbish as the death sequences aren't that bad. We've got one kid being strangled in the bath, another is decapitated by a piece of stray metal while another is mauled by glass from a computer monitor, and later a set of kitchen knives. However, it's all spoilt by the boring characters and silly dialogue (imagine 'death' is after you; would you really 'challenge' it with harsh language?). I'm all against remakes, but this is a premise I'd love to see tackled by a talented group of people. With a good cast, interesting writing and a talented director; this idea could be taken all the way to the realms of the horror classic. Unfortunately, the chances of anyone making a film like that these days is slim because all of these sorts of things have to be done with 'teens' (a.k.a. actors in their early twenties, playing teens) for teens to ensure that the film will sell.

The best of the teen slasher films,"The film Final Destination is actually not a teen slasher film in the ways like it does not have a masked killer or a 90210 style cast, what it does have is the extremely talented team of Glenn Morgan and James Wong who did many episodes of The X Files (particularly the chilling ""Home"" episode). The movie Final Destination is a great hart pounding film that explores Death in many ways and is at times a touching movie (especially the first half), a film with the emotion like this one has needs a good actor in the lead role and it has that in actor Devin Sawa (who was also very funny in last years Idle Hands), the only thing about the movie is that the killer IS death and as the tag line says ""you can't cheat death"" so you kinda know there all going to get it in the end and the scene with Tony Todd is kinda hokey but all in all this was one of the best movies of 2000 and IS the best horror movie in a long time (it's way better than Blair Witch Project).

The death plan cannot be circumvented,"After watching the ""Destination"", I was really afraid of everything around me, realizing that every object in the apartment, entrance, on the street or somewhere else poses a serious danger to my life and the life of others. I was impressed. ""Destination"" was an amazing discovery, a fresh idea on the market, a discovery for the horror genre.In general, the time of the 80-90s in the horror section was entirely given to maniacs. They were remembered, films acquired endless sequels, but the theme remained the same - a homicidal maniac who goes through all obstacles to his next victim. Involuntarily, two questions arose: ""Who is the next victim?"" and ""Who is the killer?"". So ""Destination"" went a completely different way, forcing viewers to ask a new question: ""How will the next character die?"" And this is a winning decision of the creators, which really brought freshness to the horror, and at the same time showed cruelty from the point of view of real everyday death and without any antagonist. Although some believed that Death itself decided to hunt for those who unexpectedly deceived her before.The acting team is not very famous. By the time I watched it, somewhere in the early 2000s, I only knew Sean William Scott from his Stifler from ""American Pie"". Here the guy played a different role, but, in my opinion, it was impossible for him to fully open up here, and the role of the joker from another movie somehow hung in the air. Two main characters were very memorable: Devon Savva and Eli Larter. They perfectly showed what horror takes hold of a person when there are no suspects even, and Death is on your heels. Comparing myself with them, I was imbued with the hopelessness that they demonstrate on the screen. They do not turn into humble ""waiting"" for their end. No. They are fighting for life. It's just that their facial expressions are very memorable when the guys realize that no one will believe them, and they are essentially doomed, despite all their attempts to escape. There is also a great cameo by Tony Todd in the film. The actor looks very frightening and insightful in the frame.The musical accompaniment is not particularly memorable, but visually the picture is just beautiful. It was a time when computer special effects were gaining convincing popularity due to the availability of beautiful pictures. And here they were applied with due necessity. Unless of course I'm mistaken, and it really was computer special effects. Nevertheless, each frame with the death of people looked very convincing. Physics is great. Usually someone can fall dramatically and die or something like that. Here everything is presented to the viewer without embellishment and unnecessary conversations. Once there is no person, and you only have time to gasp, realizing that something irreparable has happened for the hero. The opening scene on the plane is especially memorable. I still remember how I squeezed the arm of the chair until my knuckles turned white. A truly terrifying scene. There are also outright distortions of reality in terms of the explosion of some objects that cannot explode in such a situation, but this does not spoil the situation at all. Everything is in place.As a result, a great movie, a fresh plot, good acting, an atmospheric picture, a penetrating plot that is memorable. Great movie.10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"No longer novel, but still watchable.","""But what if it was our time? What if we were not meant to get off that plane? What if it still is our time?""I'm sure everyone on Earth knows how these movies work, by now. A group of people (attractive teenagers, for the most part) narrowly escape certain Death as participants in some disaster. Yes, Death, with a capital D. But Death is not to be denied, so he sets up increasingly elaborate scenarios to kill off the survivors, while they attempt to thwart his plans yet again and live another day.As you can tell from the description, these movies are basically just about the death scenes and trying to guess how each person is going to bite the bullet, before it happens. They're like Saw without the torture and convoluted back story.Compared to the movies that came later in the series, the original Final Destination isn't nearly as inventive or brutal with its death scenes. Some of them will seem downright tame to today's audiences (this movie was released way back in 2000, after all).

A classic is born!,"Ahhh, a classic horror film. The slasher films are back (then again, did they ever leave?). 'Final Destination' is an interesting concept where Death itself is the antagonist in a slasher film.After an impressive opening, the film gets more freaky. All the characters die in freak accidents, and - come to think of it - is actually so possible. For these youngsters, death is sure to knock on the door. Even though we expect it, some deaths are very unexpected - if you know what I mean - and quite shocking. The execution (pardon the pun!) of the plot is interesting and rather thrilling. The very idea of cheating death is alluring.Even more interesting, is when the characters realize they will die in the order of which they were supposed to die. Paying attention to signs all around you might save your life, but then death moves on to the next person in line, until it is your turn again, and again you have to try and outwit it. Very clever premise indeed!The film is atmospheric and foreboding, with disaster lurking around every corner. The cast is pretty good and convincing, and so are the visual effects.

A guilty pleasure where dead teenagers are mercilessly put through Rube Goldberg-esque accident fatalities,"Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) prepares for a senior trip to Paris, France departing from JFK Airport. During takeoff Alex gets a vivid vision that the plane will explode shortly after takeoff rich sends Alex into a panic resulting in 5 other students and one teacher getting off the plane as a result. When the plane explodes Agents Weine (Daniel Roebuck) and Schreck (Roger Guenveur Smith) begin investigating any possible criminal element with Alex falling under suspicion of not just the agents, but also other survivors and their families with the one exception being Clear Rivers (Ali Larter) who becomes Alex's strongest ally. However eventually the other survivors find themselves being picked off one by one in accidents that are as elaborate and unlikely as they are gruesome. Can Alex and the other survivor's cheat death yet again?Final Destination began as an X-Files spec script by Jeffrey Reddick written with the intention of getting Reddick a TV agent. A colleague at New Line Cinema read the spec script and encouraged Reddick to expand it to a feature film with New Line soon acquiring the pitch shortly thereafter. X-Files alums James Wong and Glen Morgan soon became involved and with Wong serving as director and co-writer with Glen Morgan who also produced. One of the caveats of the film was that Wong and Morgan didn't want to make a slasher movie so the decision was made to leave death as a primarily unseen force (with hints of a shadow in various kill scenes). Made on a budget of $23 million the film became a sleeper hit opening at a respectable number 3 at the box office and legging out to $53 million in the United States and #112 million worldwide with the success being enough to launch a media franchise with a sequel coming out 3 years later. Final Destination wasn't exactly a hit with critics though some like Roger Ebert praised the film for its entertainment factor, but it was a hit with audiences pretty much ensuring that more films would be created, but while still trashily entertaining the movie's not perfect and does have issues with characterization and is mostly kept aloft by its high concept.The biggest selling point in regard to Final Destination is in the idea that death is an impersonal and unseen force that has a ""design"" and if you escape that design and effectively ""cheat death"", death will correct its mistake by making sure you don't escape it twice. In a way its sort of a remix of the 90s resurgence of disaster films by way of the 90s resurgence of slasher films with the destructive and indiscriminate force of Twister or Dante's Peak mixed by way of the post-scream 90s teen horror framework and for what it is in creating an antagonist that can't be reasoned with or bargained it is an effective high concept hook. Where the movie does falter however is in its characters who range from passable or bland to kind of obnoxious and grating. Devon Sawa and Ali Larter probably give the best performances in the film by virtue of being mostly levelheaded as the leads and Tony Todd is welcome in an all too brief role as the Mortuary Attendant, but most of the other characters are either abrasive or belligerent who are confrontation or suspicious of Alex or used for comic relief that misses more than hits. I never really felt much connection to these characters when the die so the investment is not as great as it should be. The movie also is amazingly over the top outside of its death scenes with the opening ten minutes featuring multiple instances of heavy handed foreshadowing that couldn't have been any more heavily delivered if it were tied to an anvil and dropped on the audience and it becomes so thick it's borderline humorous and only one step away from holding up a big neon sign titled ""Dead Meat"".Final Destination is a guilty pleasure for me. The main premise of the killer being death itself leading to various Rube Goldberg scenarios of everyday items now spelling your demise is used to good effect with lots of memorable kills and setpieces, even if the characters struggle to be as memorable or engaging as those setpieces.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

You have the cast with Devon Sawa and a few of his costars chatting away during the movies with their input for it.  I did, however, find it annoying because you couldn't understand what they were saying and it was like when you are trying to watch a movie and the people next to you are chatting away.  The director's commentary was way better because you are shown things that you didn't see before.  I ended up seeing the movie 3 times on DVD and not once was a waste of time.

Overrated- but fun,"Enjoyable, but incredibly flawed- Final Destination takes its incredibly clever and interesting premise to B-movie levels of entertainment due to the talent involved and its inability to take itself seriously. First off, we need to talk about the acting in this film. Besides some actors performances seeming anything but convincing, the acting can also be incredibly over the top, overdramatic, and silly to the point of enjoyment (besides the brilliant Tony Todd who is as great as ever). This film is incredibly bizarre, because easly with some extra effort put into making it and a better cast of actors, it could have been a brilliant horror film- but instead its simply treading on smart ideas with unbelievably stupid characters. The look of the film is very bland, an incredibly dull and dark early 2000's point of view that ages about as well as you would expect. Despite the actors being unqualified, the film did prove to be quite thrilling along the way- some of the deaths throughout seem incredibly predictable- but others are more crafty and far better done in terms of suspense- which after all is what you want in these kind of movies. The film is incredibly entertaining throughout, and although the characters are thin and the actors are meh, you still care about what's happening as you want to see them prevail and survive this ridiculous nightmare that has been put in place for them. In the end, Final Destination is no brilliant horror film- nor do I think it is deserving of a 6.7/10 on IMDb- but it is rather enjoyable and I wouldn't mind watching it and laughing at it again sometime in the future.My Rating: 6.3/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

But i think it gets a second life when used in conjunction with this abomination of a film. What really annoys me, is that some people have the audacity to applaud this film for being, amongst other lies, ""inventive"" or ""adventurous"". translated for lay-people, no film-maker to date had the nerve to subject viewers to such unadulterated trash. Others had the idea, but dismissed it as too cruel. perhaps the most annoying part in the film for me, is when the woman at the airport check-in, inspirationally notices that the departure time of the plane, has the same digits as our lead ""character""'s birthday. Oh my god! was that the wind on the back of my neck or an eerie coincidence that could only lead the the mid air explosion of an aeroplane ? you decide. the rest of the film is also crammed with similar, ""who cares"" explanations for the irritating sequence of events. To conclude, after seeing this film, you may find yourself washing your eyes with extremely soapy water in an attempt to eradicate any images of the film that lead you to question the realms of human stupidity. yes, you did hear correctly when that 12 year old said, ""ooh, wasn't that good"". despicable.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
A classic...,"Well, there is no denying it, the 2000 thriller ""Final Destination"", from director James Wong, definitely is a classic in its own right. Not only is it a movie that was quite unique for its time, but it also spawned a very interesting and good franchise.The storyline in ""Final Destination"", as written by Glen Morgan, James Wong and Jeffrey Reddick, was not only a unique storyline and script, but also a very enjoyable and entertaining one. But better yet, it is without a doubt also a movie that you can watch again and again, and that is a great testimony to the writing skills of the three aforementioned writers.And the cast in ""Final Destination"" is also really impressive, because there are so many of the great young talents of the early 2000s on the cast list. With the likes of Devon Sawa, Ali Larter, Seann William Scott, Brendan Fehr and such, then you certainly are in good company. And with ""Final Destination"" being a thriller/horror movie, it definitely was a nice touch to see Tony Todd show up as well.Visually then ""Final Destination"" is a good movie, it was good back in 2000 and it still is a good movie visually 23 years down the lane. Lots of really great special effects.If you haven't already seen the 2000 movie from director James Wong, you certainly should do so, if you get the chance. I have watched this movie many times since 2000, and now in 2023 is definitely not the last time to watch it either.My rating of ""Final Destination"" lands on an eight out of ten stars.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The first part of the Final Destination,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The PitsAs he boards a plane on a class trip to France, Alex (Devon Sawa) begins to have premonitions that the plane and everyone on it will meet a terrifying end. As a panic attack sees him and some other trip members hauled off, it is not long before this is exactly what happens. But it seems the hands of fate that saw the deaths of all those on the plane has not stopped at the survivors and Alex and the rest of them soon find themselves in a terrifying wrangle with the hands of death itself.Despite the very interesting and original concept, the FD movies were ones I'd failed to pay much attention to until weirdly enough the promotional poster for Part 3 made me want to go see that, but I thought it would be a good idea to get acquainted with Part 1 (and maybe Part 2) first and with this first movie making an appearance on Channel 4 at the weekend (obviously on the back of the new film) I took my chance.This is an interesting idea for a horror movie, because unlike the usual phantoms and boogeymen characters in these films must overcome, here the protagonist is the very phantom force all of us will tangle with at some point: death itself. It's a real, believable evil and the original concept is used very effectively, even if I found some of the plot developments a bit predictable.The movie also suffers from a naff character in the shape of Sean William Scott. But from title to idea, this is a clever movie indeed, with some typically inventive death scenes for this genre. ***",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Interesting idea, bad execution","The basic idea was good--teens going on a flight to Paris--one freaks out because he dreams of the plane crashing--he's escorted off the plane with a bunch of friends following--they're not allowed back on--the plane takes off and blows up. They cheated death, but he comes back and goes after them one by one. Can they cheat him again?Interesting but the dialogue is terrible (the scene in the funeral home with Tony (Candyman) Todd is particularly bad), the acting is lousy and basically I was bored silly. After a while you were just waiting for the next teen to get it. The death scenes were well done and gruesome, but it gets kind of depressing when you realize you're just waiting for the next teen to get it. Also, logic flies completely out the window at the end. A boring horror thriller. Too bad--that plot had real potential!",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
It works so why bother,"'Final Destination' does not make any sense. The movie is not meant to be to make any sense so why would we bother that. It is supposed to be scary and it really is scary, sometimes. Although things are silly it is kind of original as well. A couple of people escape death because one of them had a vision. Because they messed up the plan death had for them death comes up with a new plan to kill the survivors. One by one they die but one of them, Alex (Devon Sawa), sees the design, the path that death follows. Together with the last survivors they are going to cheat death. One of them, Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), feels what Alex sees.You understand things don't have to make sense here. Right before the first time the group survives we see the vision Alex has. It is more than scary. After that things are a little the same but there are some nice ways to make a death scary. Like the sequel it is stupid but it works.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Intense film by former minions of the X-Files,"Eerie, spine tingling and different, Final Destination proved to be one of those horror movies that didn't try to sell itself as a pure horror film. Throw in some intrigue and a ton of tension, and this film clearly brought a unique perspective on the horror genre. With a genre in decay, Final Destination really brought something different to the table. Unpredictable and breathtakingly sharp, the modes of death made you want to hide in your room for a long time. The acting was fair, but it was really the execution and style this film took upon itself to create imagery unlike any other seen.

I Was Expecting THE X-FILES,"Seeing as FINAL DESTINATION was written , directed and produced by people heavily associated with THE X-FILES I was expecting something very similar to the classic American show but in the early stages the movie reminded me of that episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE where William Shatner is on a plane and Fozzie Bear from THE MUPPET SHOW is sitting on the wing . The film turns into a "" Teenagers dying one by one "" flick after this point which is a sub genre I`m not normally too keen on but this one is better than most mainly down to the way the director and screenwriter trick the audience into thinking a character is going to survive only to see them die seconds laterBy no means a classic movie FINAL DESTINATION is still a fairly entertaining one",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

I was wrong.I can't think of a plot more grotesquely stupid that of Final Destination. Five minutes into it I predicted every single frame that was still to come.Kerr Smith's character irritated beyond comprehension. Every 2 seconds he started a fight for NO REASON and was bullheaded and annoying through-out the whole film.While some of you may think that Final Destination is different from the rest of teen-horror flicks out there it has one very-annoying similarity that no can deny.

"Different... the good kind, mind you","This is perhaps best described as a slasher flick with a twist. The concept is interesting and well-developed, and remains both throughout. As long as you can do away with your disbelief for the duration, and accept that Death is going through something of a flashy phase, you're likely to enjoy this. The plot is reasonable, and keeps things going. The ending... *wow*. Thank you, Wong. Awesome job on that. The pacing is good, this certainly never gets boring. The effects are exceptionally done all the way. The acting varies, but it's never distractingly poor. Dialog... about the same, with some real high points here and there. The humor is absolutely great. It's never forced nor does it ever try too hard, and genuine comedy is the result, and it doesn't reach a level where the seriousness of the whole is lost, either. The cinematography and editing, the technical side of this in general, in marvelous. While there is some violence herein, this operates more through building tension. Suspense. The shocks are rather effective(they sure still work on me, and I've watched this a bunch of times). The writing isn't entirely flawless.

Reviews apparently written by elementary school students.,"I gave it one star because it made me laugh a lot. The Rube Goldberg death scenes, and the total implausibility of so many scenes had me laughing out loud. Usually before a train hits a car on the tracks, it slams its brakes into emergency, even though it'll never stop in time. But this train just continues to race along after the giant Hollywood pyrotechnic explosion engulfing the engineer's cab. And when friends see their friend decapitated, the don't generally shrug it off and come up with plan B. Live wires on the ground,although potentially deadly, don't fly around through the air setting fire to everything in sight. The death scenes are what really made me laugh. They were so contrived it was like watching a thousand dominoes falling to achieve a ridiculous end.I thought it was terribly insensitive for such a poor story to be inspired by an actual tragedy (TWA Flight 800) where a local town to me lost 16 high school students and 5 chaperons, including the son of a friend and coworker of mine. To this day, it is a sore subject where I live.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"If you cheat Death, he'll just kill ya goofy-like later, anyway.","I dared myself to ply this film from the shelve at Blockbuster and sit through the whole thing.  It turns out I was up for the challenge!  I kind of knew what I was getting myself into, but... whew!  This one wasn't even laughable.  It left me with a dark and unsettling fear of my bathroom and death may present itself to me in the form of a leaky toilet.  Or the fear that my computer will violently explode if I spill a small amount of liquor on the monitor.  Plus, I'm now afraid that ever time I hear a John Denver tune, the bell of death tolls for thee.  (Except for ""Thank God I'm a Country Boy!"" because life really ain't nothing but a funny, funny riddle.)For those of you who haven't see the movie, you're thinking, ""what the heck is he talking about?""  For those of you who have, you may now hopefully begin to see the downright silliness in this film.  People in this movie are killed in the same fashion as the villians in ""The Naked Gun"" series.  But at least in those movies it was meant to be funny.  But, in ""Final D"" (as its fans call it) death comes to some cast members in a long and complicated manner. Some may suggest to me that this is dark comedy.  But, then again, some people are not very bright. After quite some time, I simply found myself shouting ""just die already!"" at my television.  After it was all over finally, I was briefly expecting George Kennedy to come in and say, ""Oh Frank!  That's so horrible!  My father went the same way.""But, I must admit, I'm a tad biased.  I'm absolutly sick of the new current horror genre that stars hot, young stars of the WB.  Horror movies went from being bad and knowing that they're bad, to be being bad and pretending to be whitty.  I understand a few people were lured in with the vague promise of a horrifying plane crash scene.  But if that's all you're looking for, you can watch Edward Norton's crash fantasy in ""Fight Club."" At least that was shown in a more tasteful manner and not just made for people who like to see other people die.  (Come on!  Admit it!  That's the only reason people watch horror flicks.  It's the violence, right?  You can't tell me it's the plot!)Another problem I had was character names.  The main character's middle name is ""Chance.""  (Whoa! Now I get it!  That's such an ironic twist! HA!HA!HA!HA!)  One is ""Clear Waters,""  which is just too darn goofy.  (Is she related to Muddy Waters? HA!HA!  I'm on fire!)  There is a William and a Valerie in the film, and ""Billy"" and ""Val"" are credited as their nicknames. Did they really need to explain THAT?  It's not like I was sitting though the whole movie going, ""Now are Valerie and Val the same person?  How can that be?""Another problem I had was the title.  It's redundant.  Is there any kind of destinations other than final ones?  (Oh!  What a minute.  That's back to the dark ironic twist thing again, isn't it?  Wow! Zing!  That went way over my head!)I won't waste our time going into the plot of even bother rating this move... I loathe it too much.

Fly the Friendly Skies,"If you really want to scare someone, don't tell them another ""guy with a hook"" campfire story.  Skip the urban legends and cheesy ghost story fare. Because what really scares people is real life.Go through the list of every possible way to die in any given situation. Mention how easy it is for a plane engine to fail, or a car to break an essential part.  Comment on the plethora of common household items that, if they were to be involved in just the right coincidences, might result in your death.If you really want to scare someone, take them to Final Destination.The lead character, a high schooler named Alex Browning, is waiting on-board an international flight to Paris along with almost 40 of his classmates. During the wait, Alex has a premonition that the plane is going to blow up. He ditches the flight, taking several classmates and a teacher with him in the broil his panic incites.  These precious few have their lives changed when, sure enough, the airplane explodes just after claiming the skies.The premise:  those people were supposed to die, and now Death is simply getting caught up on his list.  This means there is no killer, there is no hockey-masked looney with a rubber knife.  There is a slight breeze, a brief, anamolous shadow, and then, you're dead.The craftsmanship here is excellent.  The deaths are all very disturbing, all very real, and all very brutal, and the effect is nauseatingly refreshing.  We don't see hysterical people running up the stairs to escape a never-tired creep, or jabbing meat thermometers into supernatural critters.  We see a pattern of easily explained, perfectly normal, lethally designed events that not only cause death, but also adapt to the victim's movements.  No matter where they go, death is at their heels, following them in the endless coincidences.  And it's all the more terrifying because it's supposed to happen, and there's no one to fight.  The most any of the characters can hope for is that Alex will predict it and, perhaps, intervene in time.  Needless to say, Alex's track record for saving his friends drops drastically post-plane crash.The acting, though excellent, is a bit forced at points, and there are parts of the movie created solely to pad the film.  A cringe-worthy expository interlude with a cheesy mortician and some repetitive dialogue are the only weak links in the show, however.  The very concept of the flick is so interesting that it laminates all the duller moments.The premise is, of course, self-destructive.  Death can't die so no matter how many times the characters manage to cheat the traps that seem to be laid for them, sooner or later, the chain of events will be set in motion all over again.  It doesn't end until they die.  This type of problem might have crippled most horror movies, but Final Destination cleverly eludes the chance of a weak and long-overdue ending by cashing in on the repetitive ""tag-you're-dead"" quality of the plot.  It ends with the understanding that it hasn't ended.Not for the squeamish of heart, this movie is a landmark in the horror movie genre.  Although it's not going to win any Oscars anytime soon, this well-timed and moodily constructed film does exactly what movies are intended to do: it entertains.  It reveals the possibility that villains are all well and good, but the true horror lies in real death, in a murderer that exists in every inanimate object you come across.Oooh.

"cliched, yet smart and very, oh so very scary","""Final Destination"" is a wonderful surprise after expecting very little from it. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. This movie is everything what ""Scream 3"" wanted to be. Not as smart as ""Scream"", but just as scary. Sometimes even scarier.The way they die is fun and refreshing. Of course, there is nothing to laugh about. But director James Wong (in a surprisingly relaxed debut) makes each frightening scene long-lasting and breathtaking. He makes an enourmously entertaining movie out of a tiny budget. The killing scenes are shocking. One of the characters is disposed off so quickly that your heart just stops. Another one upsets a computer. Another one teases us with the way he would die: slit his throat, electrocute himself. He dies in a horrifying way, completely different than what expected.The scene is gut-wrenching, just by looking into his blood-shot eyes. Finally, the last one is beheaded. The sequence is almost as good as ""Sleepy Hollow""'s decapitations, which means it is fantastic. I just love the way the guy stood there without a head on his shoulders.There are also some drawbacks but they are so insignificant that they do not ruin the movie in any way. The use of the same idea with small variations. Alcohol burns, and so does turpentine. I wish that the initial plane explosion would have been grander. Lastly, the end is a bit of a let-down.

"Terrible, terrible movie","At the beginning, the plot seemed promising but then it turned out to be terribly stupid. What bothered me most about the movie was the way they used cheap techniques to make it scary. And by that I mean all the stupid, non-sense accident scenes which are supposed to scare you. Now we are led to believe that ""death has a pattern and chooses its victims according to that pattern"". Suppose that it is true, why do all the people have to die in bizarre accidents? Are there not other ways of dying, say a heart-attack or sudden internal-bleeding or any sort of sickness? And why has it never occurred to the main character that the next victim could die just by a natural cause and not by accident? But no, people had to die in those bizarre accidents so the audience could be scared! Well, I was neither scared nor amused by these cheap tricks; I wonder who were. Throughout the movie I kept I wondering what the main message was, that death has a pattern, that we can change it? And why death always had to come as accident? Could the main character stop deaths from happening if it came as, say cancer? And one more thing: why did the main character have to presume that death was going to come immediately right after it took a victim. I mean just because he figured out who the next victim was going to be and could make a list of that, it did not mean that death was gonna hit the next victim right away!!! It could have taken 10 years for death to strike its next victim. It seemed as if not only did the main character know in advance the cause of death but the time of the death too. So, I think these otherwise-could-be false presumptions were expected to be taken for granted and the events were deliberately set-up which made the whole thing seem so obvious.

The concept is that these teens cheated their way out of death and now death is going to come back and get them.  I think this movie's plot would have been better if Steven King had made this a book.  Think about it.  It seems like a SK premise right?All these people are so concerned about dying that they generally loose it. The dialog is crummy.  I like the one part where Carter says, ""I never gonna die.""

"This film is so bad, it's insulting!","Well what can one expect from director James Wong, whose other claim to fame was another terrible film released back in early November of 2001 -The One, which starred Jet Li. I just found Final Destination to be so insulting as a film on so many different levels. It's obvious that I don't like the director's work at all. But the acting is awful, as well. Afterall, it is nothing more than some dumb teeny-bopper horror flick. And the talent that it brought into to perform for these films is never all that great to begin with. Also, the parts of the film that were supposed to be scary or shocking, came off as stupidly funny. I couldn't wait for this film to end, and I do NOT recommend seeing it. The release of Final Destination 2 has just hit theaters and naturally every teen in the country wants to see it.

Good creepy fun.,"Final Destination gives you laughs, scares and moments of whoah, did that just happen?  What makes it rise above the other films in the genre is the sure hand of the creative team, a duo responsible for many episodes of The X-Files.  Here, that general uneasiness that works well on TV, works double time in a feature film.   The set pieces of the film are done in such intricate ways, you can't help but watch.  The plane explosion is quite disturbing, and that's just the beginning.  From there, we are plunged into a film where strange things will happen, and not in the way that you would expect.  The performances are well played by the young cast, and Tony Tod has a delightful little part as an undertaker.  Just be ready to grab something during certain parts of the movie, you will jump.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Holds up really well,"Although it was never particularly scary to me, I always thought this movie did a great job with its tension-building.

"Looking forward to the remake, anyway...","Horror? Well, no. Not really. Final Destination manages to be horrifying only in a scene or two throughout its plot, though it is scary in its own way. The obsessive use of symbols and references to death would actually have been clever if it wasn't used somewhat heavy handedly at points. Some of the character relationships just don't make sense, and could have used more background to develop them. And the whole deal about the FBI trying to pin the death of his friends on the protagonist, who is convinced he's found ""death's pattern"" and is working to beat it just never quite worked for me, which is just as well, since it would have been too predictable anyway.I did like the overall concept, though. Don't get me wrong on that. So often to we hear and use the term ""cheating death"" that it is refreshing to see death doesn't always take it lying down. <g> And by eschewing the temptation to make death a personified figure and instead using wild, chaotic forces in the world around us as the agents of death's plan, Final Destination managed to be scarier than a typical slasher style movie would have ever managed. In fact, if only I had felt more for the characters, and understood better their relationships, I might actually have loved this movie.As it is, I am eagerly looking forward to some future film making genius remaking it someday.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Much potential wasted on gore,"Here is a movie whose premise was one that denoted suspense.  But in the finished product, there was little suspense and a whole lot of graphic death.  I went to this movie hoping to come out of it frightened that death was after me, but I came out of it with the fear that a sequel would be made, and according to this website, one is. Final Destination comes across as an aspiring slasher film with one thing missing: a slasher.  This should be a movie about being hunted by an invisible force, and as such, there should be suspense.  It should be frightening - I should want to yell out to the characters, ""look out, you're about to die!""

It's Impossible to Cheat Death,"""Final Destination"" (2000) presents a relatively different plot compared to most productions made in its time, exploring visions about the future and the attempt to avoid imminent death.

One of the film's biggest attractions is its deaths and how they are carried out, much of which is creative with good special effects for the time.As much as the film has its qualities and merits due to its script and effects, it leaves the viewer with the feeling that something is missing in its composition, its simplicity makes the experience unmemorable.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good idea, nothing else","The first fifteen minutes are brilliant: the idea of confronting death in the old magic way - FORESEEING it - but in the context of a very secular and everydaily situation as the class trip is, is hilarious and all the way until the explosion of the plane has our full participation and tension. But the rest is - crap. No character's development, no exploration in the nature of death, ridiculous 'sinister' episodes like that in the morgue or the 'paranatural' elements in death's 'revenge' - the film doesn't top the level of its boring teen protagonists. The end is the worst part of it. Because of the beginning, I give it a 2 out of 10; otherwise it would have been a complete disaster (1).",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good opening scene... but forget about the rest,"I actually wasn't going to watch this movie, I had the TV on while I was doing something else and this movie came up. I was hooked, however, by the plane crash scene in the beginning, which must be the scariest, most horrific, most realistic scene of this type ever. The story about its being a dream that comes true after the dreamer and some other passengers leave the plane and are therefore saved, this was also interesting, as well as the fear, instead of gratitude, that the dreamer inspires. Maybe this was not such a bad movie after all.Ah, but in the end it was. All of a sudden it becomes a supernatural teen slasher movie, with Death playing the part of Freddy Kruger, Jason and other famous slashers. After the first survivor dies, the dreamer protagonist works out that by escaping the plane they have cheated Death, who does not take kindly to this, and therefore sets out to finish his business, by killing the survivors one by one, in true slasher movie fashion. Our hero not only deducts this, but he is also more or less warned about this by an odd mortician who may or may not be Death himself. And then he works out Death's ""design"" (a favorite word of the scriptwriter), by guessing who will be the next victim, and how the victims can be saved if someone else intervenes on time. If this sounds terminally ridiculous, it is because the movie well... is silly indeed. Even those who loved the movie cannot deny that every word I've just written is true.The problem here is an indigestible mixture of things that just don't work together; it is like a pizza with meringue and cheese topping. There is nothing wrong with a good slasher movie, if your tastes run that way, but good slasher movies never take themselves seriously, something fully understood and taken to the limits by Scream, a top example. Final Destination, however, takes itself dead seriously (sorry, bad pun). Its mixture of profound speculation about the possibility of cheating death and the slapstick nature of the death scenes is just self-defeating. Since Death cannot wield the knife himself, everybody just has to die in an accident; not just any accident, they have to be particularly bizarre and convoluted, and (unintentionally, I suspect) hilarious.Anyway. If it is shown on TV, you can watch the opening minutes. Then you can find yourself something else to do.",,Anonymous,Horror

Come Fly the Deadly Skies,"Oh I was pleased to say the least that those bozos in Hollywood who have milked every last cent from us and shown us nothing but obligatory booby-shirt shots of Jennifer Love Hewitt, finally created a film under the same genre that challenged us as the audience to think! Final Destination was such a relief because there has not been an impressive horror movie made in these latter years since Scream in 1996. The film had an intriguing idea that was a beautiful back-drop for throwing teeny-boppers in the mix and scare the hell out of an audience. The first half an hour of the film left our entire audience in shock, thirsty for more. It wasn't old hat like all these other films where we see the guy with the hook in the first reel and roll our eyes, trying not to glance at our watches in eagerness to leave. What made the antagonist in Final Destination so terrifying was that it could not be brought on to screen in a physical form. There was no mask, no butcher knife (well, maybe one), and no explanation or motive. It was all up to the viewer to envision 'Death' in any way they wanted to.I fully recommend this movie to all. The story and direction is beautiful, and like I said before, the first half an hour is a sight to see.

The only thing that really ""creeped me out"" about the movie was the plane crash. Having a fear of flying the crash scene at the beginning hit home and made me squirm.The only real flaw in the movie (aside from the horror formula used over and over again) is the fact that if death wanted to get you it could find ways other than elaborate ways it does in this movie. Death would just give them all heart attacks and be done with it. It's like the when death wants to go get an ice cream cone it buys a cow and milks it and makes cream then mines the minerals to build a refrigerator to turn it into ice cream. It's all to hokey.

"Not the top shocker, but a worthy addition to the line-up","I don't know what the authors of the other comments are on about, I really liked this film. Maybe they tried to look too deep into the film, which is difficult since it is as shallow as they come. If you ignore the facts that the acting is a little wooden and the plot slightly contrived then this is a good enough way to spend a couple of hours, if only for the chance to see the characters getting picked off one by one in increasingly brutal ways. It would seem that Death is not someone you really want to annoy since he is incredibly resourceful when it comes to pay-back time.There was quite a lot of hype surrounding the film in the UK, what with the TV adverts showing people jumping out of their seats in terror every 10 minutes and I must admit that I did jump, but only about twice. It was definitely not the `shocker to end all shockers` it was made out to be.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Why Would Anyone Watch This On Purpose?,This is the very definition of tragedy porn. It takes the ideas of traffic accidents and plane disasters and turns it into a popcorn flick. Take something like Scream but instead of a masked killer (which has already been done to death) an airplane crash with severed heads and burnt up bodies. Why the ___ in this day and age would people pay money to watch dozens of violent deaths for the thrill of it? Watch a movie which shows tragic death without the depersonalization. It will serve as a reality check and maybe people will then understand that these filmmakers don't give a damn about film and that they only want to make money off of fetishized hyper-violence.,4.0,Anonymous,Horror

A chilling experience...,"This movie had a very unique story.  It could have been one of the best thriller/horror flicks made in recent years, if it wasn't for the less than believable reactions by the actors during some of the intense scenes.  The majority of the work on this film was focused on the several ""death"" scenes, which are some of the scariest I have ever seen.  The details are amazing and the surprise factor is better than that of Scream.  The acting was not superb, but decent enough to carry the story, which was not directed as well as it could of been, either.  I think it was James Wong's first feature film, so he gets bonus points for that.  All in all, it was really entertaining; definitely worth seeing in the theaters.

Immediately after establishing the fact that this was (hopefully) going to be a good movie, though, it dropped suddenly and became another stupid teen horror movie, much like the aforementioned films (only without the killer with the scary mask and scary knife).  It seems almost like some Hollywood studio exec said ""Make this more of a teen flick, with tons of idiotic dialogue and over-explanations.""  I'm hoping that was the case with this film, because If the writers wrote this solidly then I feel very sorry for them.  Whoever was responsible for the casting, though, did a great job.  In particular, Daniel Roebuck as one of the FBI agents and Tony Todd as the mortician were a pleasure to see.  I also have to give them credit for having a group of well-known young actors/actresses play roles that I couldn't picture them playing (and actually doing a good job at it).

'Avoid it like the plague'. Worst. Movie. Ever.,"Yet another excellent premise ruined by pandering to a teenage audience in the worst possible way - through a plethora of over-the-top scare tactics and with a lack of unpredictability.I waited until this wretched film got to the dollar theatre, and that's the thing I'm most thankful for about the entire experience. I feel guilty for recommending that my friends and I go see it, I feel robbed for not knowing about rottentomatoes.com back in the day (which has saved the day multiple times since Final Destination), and I wished that I had snuck in.The opening scene should have said it all - there was every shlock scare effect in the book, mostly being the wind whistling through a room and shuffling some papers around. And it didn't stop there, like I was hoping against hope - the emotions were trite and the scares false throughout the movie's short run time.And as for anyone who avoided planes after this movie: you're a tool of the system and most likely avoided air travel for a full year after 9/11 (when, in fact, it was the safest time imaginable to travel, and the cheapest).At any rate, the best part, a jewel in the rough, was that simpering girlfriend getting plowed by the bus. That was classic. The rest was disposable.And yet... I'll see the sequel, maybe even on opening night, as laughing at a movie is getting to be as common and as pleasurable as laughing or shrieking along with a movie.Anyone who bought the DVD for anything other than the scant sexual content should break it into small pieces and go for the gusto in the vein of what they obviously are reaching for: a way to hurt themselves and like it because the media told them to.

Worth your while,"Alongside ""House on Haunted Hill"", this is one of the better follow-ups in the line of 'new' teen slasher horror flicks (starting from, of course, ""Scream""). What could I say?

Directing is good, but towards the end a bit too hectic - with a little less rushing the director might of had juiced up a bit more ""horror"".

One of the best horror movies of 2000.,"""Final Destination"" is the kind of horror film that works because it doesn't rely on maniacs running around with chainsaws(Although I did like ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"").It doesn't rely on our fears by surrounding us with flesh eating zombies(""Dawn of the Dead"" I have to point out was a classic).And it doesn't play with our fears by throwing out scenes of sexuality in which the characters are usually killed.Instead,the movie plays with our emotions because it deals with how we can never cheat death.A group of teenagers are thrown off of a plane before it takes off because one of the teenagers has a vision that the plane explodes and begins freaking out.The survivors begin to act suspicious of the visionary young man because he seems to know when the next one will die.What's worse is that the survivors of the plane seem to be getting killed under weird mysterious circumstances.Throughout the movie,the characters are not killed by getting shot or by the hands of another person but they are killed in situations that are to weird to explain.""Final Destination"" works as a horror movie because it throws The Grim Reaper right at us.The entire film is about death and how some people try to cheat it.""Final Destination"" also works because it teases us making us think we know how one character will die but keeps us guessing and watching.""Final Destination"" was the kind of film that I had the pleasure to watch.Very good film that will keep some people glued to their seats.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A cool look at Death,"After a long series of slasher films the genre seems to be running dry and the killer with the *insert weapon here* idea is getting boring.So, they thought of this movie! Death is literally out to get these poor people and It is doing the actual stalking. No killer, no masked murderer but Death Itself. Kinda cool if you think about it.The story kicks of with a student who has a premonition and as a result saves some of his classmates from a horrific plane accident. Death isn't so pleased and decides to finish Its job. Tension and inventive death sequences ensue. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Creative, Intelligent Fun.","I had heard Final Destination was the best teen horror film since Scream. Although that may not be exactly correct, I still enjoyed myself during this intelligent and fierce thriller.Death has a plan and Alex (Devon Sawa) has ruined it. After having a premonition the flight he and his school group are about to take will explode in mid air, he tries to warn everyone. Of course no one believes him and with a handful of classmates, he is thrown off the plane before it takes off. When the plane bursts apart just after take off, Alex realises he has cheated death ¬ñ and now it's time for payback. One by one, the survivors begin to die in horrific, mysterious circumstances. Now that Alex has figured Death's plan, can he do anything to alter the destiny that awaits him?Final Destination isn't a bad film. In fact, its pretty darn good. The performances are impressive, Devon Sawa possibly gave his best performance, while Dawsons Creek actor Kerr Smith gives a smartly evil role as Carter. Also Ali Larter, Chad Donella and Sean William Scott are very good performers for this horror flick. The script is very original, writer Glen Morgan deserves praise for his abilities on the keyboard. I love the deaths, they are very creative, and the direction is full of effort.Although slightly sometimes Final Destination can be slightly overrated, I highly recommend it for an audience who want to have a scarily funny good time.I rate Final Destination 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Fairly well done,"The concept for Final Destination was a good one. Young kid with clairvoyance cheats death by hopping off a plane before it blows up, then has to avoid death coming back for it's just dues. From there we proceed to watch cast members drop faster than Madonna's pants. The characters were a little underwritten, but the camera work and lighting was done quite well. Our protagonist has a situation similar to a Hitchcock film --- an ordinary man (kid) caught in extraordinary circumstances. The death scenes are fairly elaborate and best of all the killer is the unseen force we all must meet someday. Mix in a cliffhanger ending and we find a thrilling and satisfying movie.

GO EXPERIENCE THIS FILM!!!,"WARNING:  This review contains SPOLIERS!Not in a long time has a movie ""stayed"" with me long after I left the theatre.  I saw it a week ago, and I still think about it everyday, and the questions it poses.If you're reading this, you probably already know what FINAL DESTINATION is about. But I'll cover the bases anyway. A student named Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) has a dream about a plane that he and his french class are on exploding in mid air.  When he wakes up, things start happening just as they had in the dream.  Alex freaks out, and is removed from the plane, along with five other classmates and a teacher.  As these seven are grounded, their classmates are Paris bound, and everyone is mad at Alex for disrupting their plans.  But lo and behold, as the seven (and the audience) watch in horror, the plane they have just left explodes shortly after takeoff.  The rest of the story is like this:  they cheated death.  Now death has to come back and finished what he started.Now that I've set you all up, here is my personal review.  In one word: WOW!!.  Sure the plot may sound a bit cheesy, but believe me, this film is one heck of a roller coaster ride.  The first twenty minutes will hold you breathless as you await the inevitable plane crash.  After that happens, the film sustains the gloom created from the disaster, adding creepiness to the mix because you never know what's going to happen next.  Who will die next? And how?  The movie hints at how the people will die, but it's not until after the fact that you say ""oh, so THAT'S what they meant by that image!""Speaking of images, this movie is filled with images you won't get out of your head for a while.  The horrific plane explosion is just one of many. The writing is such that you actually care for these characters, so when one of them dies, you feel a sense of shock and sadness.  And acting wise, the cast does a great job of showing us that what is happening is real to them. Sawa is terrific as the one who knows deaths design and must convince everyone else, and Ali Larter (who's great in everthing she does) is extraordinary at showing us the human factor of the tragedies.  I was hoping that Amanda Detmer would have more screen time, but she was unforgettable in what little role she had.  And cheers to Kerr Smith.  Not for a second did I see Jack from Dawson's Creek.  He was all Carter.Even though there are some flaws in the film (you can clearly see a ""dead"" body's eyes moving) some of the explanations get confusing (at least they did to me) and some of the lines are corny, it's a wonderfully terrifying film that, on more that one occasion, made me jump out of my seat more that any film has in a LONG LONG time.  The story is an interesting idea that could have easily become a terrible B-movie, but all the writers, directors and cast bring such a maturity and sense of seriousness to it that you can't help but be engrossed by it.  And the film makes you think of your everyday life as well, making you think about what fate (and death) have in store for you. Finally!!! A ""teen"" movie that everyone can enjoy!!For a great hour and a half of stunning entertainment, pay the money and see FINAL DESTINATION.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A cut above the typical entries in the genre,"I thought the premise of this teen horror flick was pretty cool - death itself has been cheated and now is fighting back to claim its own.

Fantastic,"Looking up reviews of this movie i did not expect it to be good at ALL.  i saw only low ratings such as 3 out of 10, etc, however I STRONGLY disagree. Though the acting was a bit shallow, the plot was FANTASTIC.  The opening was extremely powerful.  While I sat in the Theatre about 10 people walked out in fear.  The biggest thing for me was the incredible imagery that is shown throughout the film, if u have an eye for symbols or subtle elements that make the action in the film all the better than you will love this movie.

Foresight,"Having foreseen the impending explosion of a plane and saved his friends' lives, a teenager becomes convinced that they accidentally cheated death and that a grim fate still awaits them in this slick horror-thriller. While similar to Thom Eberhardt's 'Sole Survivor', this latter film is still blessed with a fairly original premise and there are several intense moments to be had as the teens try to avoid Death coming for them after two of the surviving friends die in mysterious circumstances. The premise does, however, offer far more questions than answers, such as why Devon Sawa's character is sometimes able to foresee what will happen, why Death takes so long to come after them again, and most strikingly, why almost all of the deaths are elaborate and over-the-top. Imaginative death scenes are great in a movie such as a 'Friday the 13th' sequel, but here it just seems pointless if we assume that Death really wants the characters dead. While it might not all make sense, 'Final Destination' is nevertheless incredibly well filmed. The early moments of Sawa's hyper-awareness pre-flight are very well done and the camera hardly ever sits still throughout, often gliding and sweeping over the characters in a creepy manner. The film additionally deserves some credit for ending on a darkly comic laugh for what it is otherwise a rather grim take on fate and predestination.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
...a nice change from the usual slice-em-dice-em teen-slasher formula..,"A pretty decent horror flick, Final Destination presented an interesting story and was a nice change from the usual slice-em-dice-em teen-slasher formula.I thought the use of ""Death"" as the unseen killer was particularly effective, and the movie manages to keep it's presence subtle rather than going all out with special effects and a physical portrayal.The last time I saw Devon Sawa was in Casper and he sure has grown up.  I thought the acting in general was pretty average but hey it's a horror flick, we're not after Oscar-worthy performances here.The story as I said, was quite interesting and definitely gets you thinking.

"Loved it, but doubtful about the film's long-term merits","As an joltingly-directed, suspense-driven thriller in the post-""Scream"" vein, ""Final Destination"" more than hits the spot.Director James Wong has fashioned a genuinely entertaining and superbly scary horror film which pays a genre-literate, affectionate tribute to classic horror directors (Keep an eye and ear out for the character names) and delivers more than enough 'Jump-out-of-your-seat' moments, to thrill on the most visceral levels that horror films live or die by.The cast of young up-and-comers are by and large excellent, though particular mention has to be made for lead, Devon Sawa, whose character reacts to the on-screen mayhem by essentially being as panic-stricken and prone to jumpy as any cinema audience watching this film must have been.Full marks, too, for some grand standingly-bloody and spectacularly inventive set-pieces, which recall nothing so much as Dario Argento gone Hollywood and presented with a studio budget.Simply put, I can't wait to see James Wong's next film.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"""Innovative"" is something else","There could certainly have been hundreds of ways to make a better movie out of this ""Death hunts people""-topic. The first mistake was to choose highschool pupils as the main characters, which is surely good for making teenagers go to the cinema to watch the film, but concerning the acting this was catastrophic. The whole plot is built to impress the low-expectations-14-to-19-years-old-audience, not only is the plot as predictable as what day comes after Monday, this ever present ""death has a scheme and all I have to do is find out how it works"" is just ridiculous. Moreover there are five to ten hints every time a person is going to be killed, I think one or two NOT SO OBVIOUS hints would have been enough (I just remind of one scene: ""Tod"" cut out of a newspaper, it really can¬¥t be more obvious!!), but I guess that was necessary to make sure that everybody in the audience would get it.

Surprisingly good movie!,"I went to see ""Final Destination"" without any expectations, I havent really seen any commercials for it and theres no well known actors in it.I was surprised on how good it was.

I do not agree.""Scream"" was the first in a series of ""new"" slasher movies, but it`s originallity really disappeared after the first one. The story of a serial killer has after ""Scream"" been portrayed in films like: ""I know what you did last summer"" and ""Urban Legend"". Another likeness amongst theese movies is that there is always young people being slayed of, and that was the only thing that annoyed me a bit about *""Final Destination"" as well.On the other hand, ""Final Destination"" is quite original when it comes to ""the killer"". Now, i won`t give anything away, but it`s really different, and if you`re ready for something else than the story of a mad serial killer doing it over and over (Friday the 13th, Halloween, Scream, and hundreds of others...).The cast is good and the best scene is in the aircraft and when Terry decides to take the bus....Enjoy!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
quite decent little teen horror flick,"I did not expect much of this movie. The idea, some people surviving a plane crash and then being haunted by death, seemed far-fetched, and I had heard some pretty negative comments from friends. But then not everyone is a fan of teen horror movies, and I guess the negative reactions were mostly due to that. Of course the plot is far-fetched, of course there are some inconsistencies, and of course this isn't anything meaningful. But I think that teen horror movies have to be judged by the standards of the genre. And seen from this perspective, it does pretty well. First of all the production values are good, the editing careful (watch the title sequence with all the little cues), the overall design nicely thought out. Casting is o.k., even though Kerr Smith may seem a little out of place to fans of ""Dawson's Creek"". There are enough graphic deaths to keep the more gore-oriented faction of fans reasonably satisfied, the love story (doesn't every teen horror flick need one) is nicely subdued, and most important - it is at no time apparent what is going to happen next. The end, which some people seem to have found confusing, actually makes a lot of sense and cleared up a nagging feeling of being cheated that I had during the last ten minutes or so, expecting a typical happy end. Instead it leaves the future of the two remaining survivors at stake - inviting the (probably rather cheap) sequel that movies of this genre need. All in all a wholly watchable effort.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Comedy or thriller?,"This film is advertised as a horror/thriller.  It starts out that way too. The story is interesting enough to be an effective thriller.  The first 20 minutes are the only moments that actually work as a triller, however.  Soon our heroes are trying to fend off exceedingly elaborate Rube Goldberg death traps.  The first one is very unpleasant.  But after that, they are so far out that it's almost funny.  By the final elaborate series of fateful coincidences, it's impossible to believe that the filmmakers weren't trying to be funny.  It's almost as if they started out with a idea they thought would make a good horror film, but eventually they couldn't figure out how to carry it through to the end, so they decided to get wacky.  A few years ago I would have hated this movie, but I've become so jaded by bad movies in my search for decent genre films that now it almost passes as a way to kill a couple of hours.  Almost.  With a bit of careful and restrained writing, this idea could have worked.",,Anonymous,Horror
Watchable...if you can cope with the ridiculous bits,"Final Destination lends itself to having fun poked at it because it's all so silly. But at the same time, if you can cope with sitting through an hour and a half of mush and being whacked with plot-device sledgehammers every ten minutes, the ending is great. Having said that...This is typical Hong Kong fare, thanks to direction from James Wong - a movie that quickly and forcibly tells you what is and what isn't, and then proceeds to break its own rules. There are scenes reminiscent of Scream, there are parts that remind you of Police Story, there are bits that seem like something from The X-Files. But then there are the parts that - if they weren't so gruesome - could have come straight from a breakfast time cartoon show, the way they're so contrived. Like backflipping lamp posts, and flying pieces of metal, and sundry other assorted devices.Not to mention the mortician is just ridiculous...But, if you can cope with all the tripe, surrounding it is quite an amusing story of how to cheat Death. Only problem is, Death doesn't give up very easily.Six out of ten.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Interesting concept! Disgraceful development!,"The first 15 minutes of this movie are very promising and worth watching. But the rest is very badly developed. The way events happen in the story are very unrealistic and unexplained. For instance, it's very unlikely for Tod to slip on some water and then suddenly choking himself to death on the bath tub. Things on this movie just wont match or link. It's very odd, and there are no good reasons to why that one guy started a fight on the plane. Also, it's very unlikely that people would treat the protagonist with so much dislike after he has just saved six people's life.Finally, the events don't make a lot of sense, and it disappoints me as I was expecting it to be a lot better than ""Scream"", but now I find it at the same level.

One of the most effective horror movies I've ever seen,"We've all seen a million deaths in movies, and for the most part we are desensitized to it, and we are able to predict the deaths we see on the screen. But occasionally, a movie comes along that surprises us with its scenes of death and violence. Part of the joy of Pulp Fiction was its unpredictability. Anyone who's seen Deep Blue Sea remembers the effect of the scene where a character dies completely unexpectedly. Final Destination succeeds where other horror movies have failed because it takes time to make characters interesting, makes their discussions about death and control over one's destiny intriguing, and their deaths are more than just predictable cliches. Of course, this is still a horror flick, but it's scary because monsters and serial killers can be beaten with sheer physical force, but what do you do when your enemy is death itself, that unseen, unstoppable force that has all of us on his list? This is at the core of what makes the horror genre so entertaining- it allows us to examine the subject of our own death, something we're all curious about, without having to stare it right in the face. If we see it in exaggerated style, on a movie screen, we're just voyeurs. ""Destination"" shows us death the way it really is- unpredictable, inevitable, sudden, meaningless. And that is truly scary.Note: this would not make a very good in-flight movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

I cannot wait to see if Final Destination 2 is as good as this one. Final Destination is a must see for horror/thriller fans.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Silly, but with a great crash scene","I thought the film started brilliantly. I love that kind of hallucination/dream switch with reality. I thought the opening crash scene was marvellously horrific.So you find yourself in a really fascinating scenario: The guy had just had a premonition about a terrible disaster and then watched it actually happen. How would everyone cope? - Him with the guilt, the others with their suspicions of how he knew.If you missed the opening fifteen minutes either re-wind the tape or don't bother watching any more.Because.. instead of exploring those things the film took us down a stupidly childish story about hocus pocus and the dreaded grim reaper choosing who would die and who wouldn't and how, no matter how you try, you can't dodge your fate.The clever young hero had worked out what 'Death' had ""intended"" - including the order that the escapees were 'supposed' to die. I hate this kind of nonsense.The film just gets worse the longer it goes on and the ending sums it all up.  I gave it 4 just for the crash scene and the first fifteen minutes.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not for the squeamish,"We've all heard the phrase, `kids do the craziest things-they think they're invincible.""  Given the recent surge of teen slasher movies like ""Scream"" and ""Urban Legend,"" Hollywood producers are well aware of this truth. Seems like they're serving up a little reminder to the youth of America: Your number could come up at any moment, just like anybody else.Even if Hollywood has no such intentions, it has discovered that their younger audiences are getting more sophisticated and are looking for new and clever ways to see themselves get killed. The latest killing spree film, Final Destination, doesn't mess around with guns and psycho killers, but gets right to the point: The killer here literally IS Death, which proves It can get pretty creative when it comes time to claim somebody. The idea is that Death has a design for everyone, that each moment of our lives is just a cycle of events that lead up to the End.  We're free to live our lives as long as Death lets us. Pretty depressing stuff but there is a point, which I'll explore in a minute. First, the nuts and bolts of the story...Seems Alex Browning (Devon Sawa), a high school senior, is given a special, unexplained ability to foresee his demise.  He sees it exactly as it's going to happen, in one of the most terrifying sequences ever filmed.  Apparently Death hadn't taken this into account; Alex goes berzerk and warns others of what's about to happen. A few people are saved, but most of the people involved proceed right into Death's arms, just as Alex foresaw (I'm not going to give away the details of this opening sequence, simply because too many other people, plus the film's trailer, have already ruined it). So here we have seven people who Death was all ready to claim, alive and safe. Apparently, this makes Death mad and It starts to pick them off one by one. Seeing as these people, five of Alex's fellow students and one teacher, defied Death's original plan, Death has to get creative. The most mundane of household objects, most of which we would never think of as lethal, are used together in bizarre, sometimes silly, chain reactions of events that lead to the kill.  All of these scenes are shocking, gruesome, or both, so be warned: this film is not for everybody.Along with having visions of his own death, Alex is able to foresee others' deaths and tries again to cheat the Reaper. He beat It once, and believes he can do so again (ah, the ego of the teenage male). There's a scene in which Alex knows it's his turn to go, so he locks himself inside a remote cabin and duct tapes down anything and everything that could possibly turn into a lethal object. He eats pudding from a tin can, having used leather work gloves to open it, sloshing the food around in his mouth to make sure there's nothing hard inside that he could choke on. This was a funny moment, and humor is something this movie uses well to give the audience a break. The scene reminded me of the way a parent of a curious toddler would start to think about household objects in a way she never thought of them before. This parent starts thinking of scenarios in which, a ball of yarn for instance, could become lethal.  Whether you think this is wisdom or paranoia, that parent understands one thing: Death does not discriminate. It happens to the helpless, the innocent, those who least `deserve' it. As cold and unfeeling as this film seems most of the time, it takes care to illustrate this point.This ain't no masterpiece, but this was an innovative piece of work; a worthy first crack at feature directing by TV veteran James Wong.  In the simplest terms, Final Destination is one hell of a good thrill ride. Suspend your disbelief at the ticket office and buckle up.Grade: B-",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A good idea sucked dry by a predictable plot.,"When I first heard about Final Destination, I found the premise intriguing. Death stalking it's victims, unseen terror.  I actually saw it hoping that it would be an elevation above the teen horror flick genre.  Hope as I might, the burst into flames as quickly as the plane that sets up this cliche ridden, badly written, and horribly acted film.  Alex Browning is journeying with his classmates on a year end trip to Paris.  The movie opens admirably, despite several predictable moments (Alex's father saying ""Live it up, you've got the rest of your life ahead of you"", when thunder suddenly booms in the background and ominous notes take over.  We are introduced to all the key characters at the airport, several creepy, morbid kids who would benefit from psychological counselling.  Anyway, as Alex boards the plane, he falls asleep and is struck by a extremely vivid (and frightening) vision of the plan exploding.  When he causes a ruckus, Alex and several other members of his class are forced off.  Upon takeoff, guess what happens. The plane explodes, leaving the seven survivors to mourn for the two-hundred and eighty killed.  Now the idiocy begins.  Toilet water chases people through their houses, knives fly, kitchens explode, small sheet metal becomes deadly, decapitating flying blades.  James Wong, who did several X-Files episodes, obviously hoped to capitalize on this original idea of seven people who have cheated death, and have angered the cosmic existance.  But he is a rookie, and, though their is no boogeyman, the deaths of several expendable students are completely cliched.  The acting is forced, Devon Sawa and Ali Larter prove incapable of evoking sympathy, and Tony Todd as the death-obsessed mortician, is almost painful to watch.  However, challenging the acting for the statuette of 'pointless endeavour' is the writing.  Idiotic sick jokes fall flat, mindless murders grow tedious, and embarassingly bad lines pervade this film.  The stupid psychobabble makes the story seem incredibly corny, while an abyssmal ending, attempting black comedy, mares any chance of redemption.  A good outline for movie, but nothing more.  Maybe in a few years a more qualified director will produce the premise more seriously.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A gripping and scary ""Destination""","One minute, you seeing in your own vision that something terrified is going to happen to the airplane after takeoff. Then, suddenly, it happens in real life. And this is just the beginning of ""Final Destination"", an always haunting but thought-provoking motion picture. From the first half-hour, you know that you're in for a different kind of thriller.After the explosion, Death starts a design that leads to some deaths of the crash's survivors. One of the survivors, Alex {Devon Sawa} tries to figure out who get killed next and to stop and cheat Death. This is really one of those times to put your brain off logic and on focusing on what really happens next.Devon Sawa is intelligent and not afraid as Alex and Ali Larter's performance as Clear is full of anguish. Plus, little comic support is provided by Chad Donella as Alex's pal, Tod.James Hong's direction is intense and scary when it really needs to be. The smart script makes the viewer to keep guessing until the very end. The late Shirley Walker's score is chilling and reminds me of the old scores in the films of Hitchcock. The effects help give the death scenes a shiver to the body and bone as well as a shock to the mind. The final showdown and surprise ending has the same feeling as well.The film gives a perfect after movie discussion for the question of ""what happens if or when we die?"" It even shows why the later sequels didn't have a heart and mind. Because the film was and always has been an original. This is one of the scariest movies out there and a perfect Halloween film.

Surprisingly Fun,"This, ultimately, is just a slasher movie. But it's unique in the sense that the killer isn't your traditional Freddy, Jason or Michael. It's literally just Death, an entity we never see personified, which is something the film takes great advantage of.The film is fun to watch. Devon Sawa gives a fantastic performance. The humour, while not readily present, still lands well when it's used. The kills were well planned and executed, as was Alex's reaction/involvement in each.It's far from a perfect film, but it's also a film that doesn't deserve the unexplainably low review it got over on Rotten Tomatoes (35% at the time of this writing). If you go into it expecting a slasher and are prepared to receive nothing more or less, you'll have a good time.The only negative thing that I can personally say about this film is to criticize the pointless and tasteless joke on Michael Jackson. It had no place in the film and only served to add more negativity to a situation that was still ongoing and very hostile at that point in time. Any filmmaker who needs to drag Michael down for a laugh deserves a little bit of negative reaction thrown at their movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Original sets the path for the franchise,"Final Destination has been a successful and known horror-thriller franchise. Starting with the original film, released in 2000, which may have been a modest decent hit domestically, warranting it a sequel. Having originaly seen Final Destination several years ago (around 2012), much have been lost and forgotten about this film, though several small details have been remembered,Final Destination is quite a thrilling and suspenseful film, although at times has some cheesy teen humor (which may be expected given its target audience). As a rewatch 12/09/18', the film is as good and enjoyable as remembered. The cast plays well as we can see the suspense and thrills coming. Overall, Final Destination is quite a solid film, which may be worth another watch. As another rewatch 03/11/20' the film holds well and remains a good watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Laughably Bad Horror Film!,"The fact that this film is so popular seems almost as implausible as the incredibly predictable ""moments of suspense"" it contains!Personally, I found it hilariously bad! The acting wasn't as bad as the story, but no amount of Hollywood talent could have made this film worthwhile unless it had been written as a comedy.The film presents Death as so methodical and swift, but so many times that all of the people who walked off the plane before it crashed are grouped together, Death is taking a breather, apparently! I mean, for cryin' out loud! At least 39 days have passed before Death even decides to take care of his unfinished business!As for the ending, I have to wonder if the writers hadn't been watching some Road Runner cartoons as they wrote it! If you've seen it, you'll know what I mean.So many people have praised this film for being original. But in my opinion, it borrows much from ""The Frighteners,"" a horror/comedy from a few years back. If you want to see a film with someone dealing with Death in a decent horror/comedy context, I'd highly recommend watching ""The Frighteners"" instead of ""Final Destination.""I suppose if you want a good ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" type of laugh-fest, ""Final Destination"" might be the sort of movie for you.

It is too bad that the quality of the film had to suffer motivated by a targeted higher box office sales.

This trip is a rough ride,"Final Destination: When a horrible vision leaves him in hysterics, Alex Browning and several classmates are removed from their Paris-bound plane. Sitting in the waiting area, they watch in horror as the plane bursts into flames and crashes into the sea.   Though scared and confused, they are thankful for being spared.  But fate isn't ready to give up so easily.Although Destination is another body-count movie it is a nice change of pace from such tiresome slasher flicks as ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" or ""Urban Legend"".  Rather than an unhinged serial killer driven by a minor slight, the pursuer here is Death itself.  I was glad to see that the producers didn't rely on CGI effects for a grim hooded specter.  Instead, Death is a quiet and subtle foe announced only by a wisp of wind, a brief shadow, or an unnerving hum- which makes for an unsettling effect.The dialogue is definitely lacking (but I didn't go in expecting Hamlet) and several of the characters do nothing but whine - their deaths couldn't come soon enough for me. There is however a palpable tension which will keep you engaged, and deliver a few jumps.Make it a matinee.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very Twilight  Zoney (at the start),"Terrific beginning, kind of like the best twilight zone ever for the first half-hour.

I began to tire of this movie right around the time it would have wrapped up as an episode of that legendary anthology gram.

So far this year it sets the standard for thriller movies,"Few thrillers explore just how terrifying death can be. Most are concerned with mysteries, chases and nearly immortal bad guys.""Final Destination,"" however, seems to want to put the entire focus of fright on death itself. Viewers find themselves thinking much more about how they think characters are going to die, and less about why.Such a result can be chiefly attributed to the plot. Devon Sawa plays a high school student set to take a class trip to France. However, before the plane takes off, he envisions its explosion and demands to be removed from the plane. The commotion forces several other passengers off the plane, and, taking off without them, it explodes in mid-air.For the rest of the movie, those who got off the plane are stalked by death itself, who apparently was not amused by being cheated out of several lives.There's little in terms of a story here, and the acting is just sort of blah. But by having no real villain in the film, it frees the death scenes into becoming among the most elaborate productions of any movie. There are no guns, axes or knives (well, almost no knives) that are standard in every other horror flick. Instead, this movie creates death scenes that require complex chains of events.The thought this movie must have taken is amazing ¬ó not only to imagine the half-dozen death scenes that are in the movie ¬ó but to create circumstances that mislead the viewer into thinking others will occur.Execution helps pull everything together. As elaborate and fast-paced as the action sequences are, the viewer can still figure out how it works because of perfect camera work.The problems with this movie all result from a fruitless effort to make the movie overly intelligent. For example, as Sawa's character tries to figure out how to cheat death again, he breaks in to the mortuary to visit death's first victim after the plane crash. If that weren't ridiculous enough, he is confronted by the mortician who tells him (in a spooky voice) the secret behind death. This scene could (and should) have simply been deleted from the movie.When the movie is not trying to be too intellectual, however, it's terrificly frightening and makes viewers squirm in their seats. So far this year, it sets the standard for thriller movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great start to the series,Final Destination is a fine movie for all the criticism it gets. The movie is based around an interesting premise and is executed well. It is fun to see the characters struggle to figure out what is happening and the trope of the characters running from the cops being blamed for murder works well. The deaths are creative as expected but not as gory as one would think. The movie has that B-horror feeling but is definitely not a horror movie. The mysterious man who helps our cast does not get enough screen time.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Something new to Horror,"Final Destination has redefined horror. Giving us something else to be afraid of. We haven't had that in such a long time. Final Destination didn't focus on the gore of the movies like it did the shadows and music that made this film keep you on the edge of your seat. it follows in the footsteps of the original Hollywood horror films that used lighting and theme music to bring about a story that gets to us all. Everyone was basically tired of the Freddy and Jason movies as the became very predictable. With Final Destination we have learned that there are still things out there that scare us. In the new era of horror Hollywood has been gracious enough to lead us into a different direction and Final Destination is at the helm, with such movies as scream & I know What You Did Last Summer it just shows to us horror fans that Hollywood can still entertain our class of viewers. Check it out you won't be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Might have you yelling ""oooh,"" ""oh!,"" and other things at the screen","What makes Final Destination rise above other films of its horror genre is there is no designated killer. It's all just a series of ""accidents"" triggered by an non-present force. It's crafty, campy, and of a different breed. It's smart, stylistic, without being too over-the-top. The only scene I can think of in this film that pushes the limit is the scene where one person is strangled to death. It's clear the screenwriter pondered on how force can strangle someone.This is another horror film where you don't know how to feel when watching it. Tense? Scared? Freaked? Sadistic? Excited? When I saw this film, around the age of seven, I was nothing but amazed. I kept trying to figure out what the hell was making these things fall and what was leading these people to die. When I watched movies, up until around ten, I truly didn't pay attention to any dialog (odd now how I brutally critique films that lack it), I just went along for the ride.Alex Browning (Sawa) is going on a class trip on a red-eye flight to Paris. Just before take-off, Alex has a brutal premonition where the plane explodes, and everyone dies. Upon awakening, Alex, like anyone, is freaked out and his panic causes classmates an orphan Clear (Larter), his bestfriend Tod (Donella), the teacher Ms. Valerie Lewton (Cloke), his rival Carter (Smith), Carter's girlfriend Terry (Detmer) and goof-off Billy (Scott).Sure enough, the plane explodes in a fiery burst killing everyone. Alex, now realizes, he has an unprecedented ability to vision an accident before it occurs. Now, the people who made the lucky attempt to get off, and dodge death, are now killed off one by one in the order they would've died on the plane. The order I won't spoil because they explain it thoroughly (and I mean thoroughly) in the film.Over the years, the dialog in this film has gotten more attention by me. First it was about the deaths, then I listened to information that was around the deaths (like a few minutes before it would happen), then I would go crazy researching the film to get every pinpoint detail on the film before going back to watching it with my undivided attention. I was a mess. I loved the film. I loved every frame of it. Loved its dare to be different style of film-making, and loved every character, even the antagonist bully.There are some movies you can't put a price on and Final Destination is the one for me. Despite its questionable premise, it tackles it in a fantastic, and enjoyable manor. It doesn't get too comical (you can save that for the fourth film), and even though you could see sequels in the film's headlights, you anticipate them to be just as good as the first if the film sticks to its formula, limits its comedy, and has believable, realistic deaths.Starring: Devon Sawa, Ali Larter, Kristen Cloke, Kerr Smith, Chad Donella, Seann William Scott, Amanda Detmer, and Tony Todd.

a guilty watch,"A group of high school students are flying to Paris for a school excursion. While waiting for take off, Alex has a vivid dream of the plane exploding mid air, just after take off. Alex freaks out and is removed from the plane, along with five other students; Clear, Carter, Billy, Terry and Tod, as too one of the teachers; Ms. Lewton. They don't believe Alex, thinking he's hysterical, yet when the plane explodes, they don't know what to believe.Final Destination has a great premise. As they left the plane, the seven 'survivors', cheated death in doing so. Though death is not done with them, picking them off one by one; there's no cheating death. Yet Final Destination isn't that great of a film over all. The directing is clumsy at times, the acting is nothing great, the dialog is nothing special either, yet these aren't the elements that make Final Destination a great watch. It's the elaborate deaths scenes that make this so interesting. Each one is either out of no where or meticulously drawn out for some exciting suspense.Devon Sawa, Kerr Smith, Seann William Scott and Kristen Cloke don't bring that memorable of performances.

Not bad at all,"Basically, a guy has a premonition that the plane he's about to board with his class will blow up. He panics, and gets himself and a few others thrown off the plane. Then, it explodes. This is where it picks up speed. Death starts stalking them, killing them off in what I have to admit are some pretty unique ways.This is not a bad horror flick. It at least has a plot, and isn't just a spectacle showing off new gore effects. The acting is pretty good, but some scenes could be improved. It has plenty of action and plot twists that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The only thing that could be improved really (aside that it's not the world's best idea for a movie, and is sort of corny), would be some of the death scenes could be extended.

Death is Comin 'Round,"I have read other comments on the movie final destination and there seems to be some mixed reviews. Personally I enjoyed it very much. The death scenes were quite elaborate and the plot of the story was very original.With a cast of bright young actors including Devon Sawa (Idle Hands), Kerr Smith (Dawson's Creek), Ali Larter (Varsity Blues) and Seann William Scott (American Pie) this movie appeals to the teen generation for sure.The movie begins with Alex Browning (Sawa) and his classmates boarding a plane for a class trip to France, but after Alex has a terrible vision of the plane exploding, he panics and is escorted off the plane along with several other students. Alex's vision comes true and then the horror begins. Because of Alex's actions, he and the other people have cheated death, thereby ruining Death's ""Great Plan"" and screwing up the pattern. So in order to stay alive Alex must again uses his visions to cheat death again, and by doing that he will supposedly be safe. This film has a great plot, and wonderful acting. There were however some questions that i was left with....1. Was Candyman supposed to be Death incarnate? 2. Why was Alex (Sawa) so special that only he could see the visions? Regardless of the questions left in your mind the movie really gets you thinking about death. Does Death really have a plan for all of us? Or can we change our own destinies. There are a few heart stopping moments, including one death scene that is totally unexpected. The others are kind of predictable but that is what makes it more intense,because you know what is going to happen but you watch the character go painfully slow through the events leading up to it. All in all, I thought it was an excellent movie and I would absolutely recommend it as a heart-stopping date flick....Go and see it...I give it an 8.5 out of 10.",,Anonymous,Horror
I never expected a movie about death to reference all the things that this one does,"I didn't see James Wong's ""Final Destination"" during its original run. One of the people in my high school class saw it and called it sad. I've now gotten around to seeing it. The movie's obviously nothing special or realistic. It reminded me of Stephen King's ""11/22/63"" (about a man who goes back in time to try and stop the Kennedy assassination); that one shows how the past doesn't like to get changed, and here we see how death doesn't like to get cheated.And the references? We not only hear John Denver songs, but the characters' names refer to horror directors. There's even a poster of John Waters's ""Pecker"".And then there's the cast. Devon Sawa, Ali Larter, Kerr Smith, Seann William Scott and Amanda Detmer were in a number of teen movies around the turn of the millennium (you may recall Larter's appearance in ""Legally Blonde"" and Scott's role in ""American Pie""). Tony Todd, meanwhile, is most famous as the Candyman.All in all, I thought that it was worth seeing. It does make you consider your own mortality.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Different Kind Of Slasher...,"I wasn't expecting much popping this movie into my DVD tray. I was surprised to find this film has quite a lot to offer. A group of students board a plane to Paris, before they take off a teen, by the name of Alex Browning (Devan Sawa) has a vision, a vision that involves the plane exploding mid-flight and incinerating all it's passengers. When he awakes from his trance he rushes off the plane taking 7 other passengers with him. They are forced to stay at the port and watch in horror as Alex's vision becomes an all so real reality. Scared, confused, and curious, the students and their families slowly begin to return to a somewhat normal life, that is until the remaining survivors start to drop off like flies. Death has returned for them and with a vengeance!I have a weird thing about kids dying in movies even if they are 17-18 years old, but plot intrigued me and really made me think, for a horror or even ""slasher"" film there is a lot under the surface. I liked the idea that death isn't a force but more of a person and a mind, that can think and analyze problems. Down to the bone though this film is just a slasher dressed up in fancy clothes. Characters are hacked of in a very violent and gory fashion. Instead of an actual killer, there is again the idea of death. Don't take that last statement negatively though, the movie was very well done and I was surprised how well written it was and even the acting. But the real treat here is for the gore fans not many films are released lately that don't have death styles executed before in repetitive fashion. Scenes throw winks here and there for a chuckle or false lead into thinking a character is knocked off in a certain way, a pattern that repeats and get old after awhile and I fear is repeated in a poor fashion. A few of the death scenes are a bit far fetched, but this isn't a movie where your meant to think. Not only are the death scenes creative but they may make you think twice to check and see if your shaving blade is rusty.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
More comedic than frightening,"'FINAL DESTINATION' was directed by James Wong and stars Devon Sawa, Ali Larter and Kerr Smith. ‚ÄãAfter a student(Devon Sawa) visions the plane he's about to board explode, he throws a fit and gets him and a group of his friends kicked of the flight. Second into the air, the plane explodes. All seems fine but when the survivors begin getting knocked off one by one, they must band together to discover the truth.Don't watch this movie if you're looking for a genuinely frightening and scary experience - you WILL be disappointed. This movie is more comedic than anything. I laughed so much more than I felt frightened. Now I think about it, I wasn't frightened at all. I wasn't even disturbed by the deaths. It was all just kind of dull. Watch this movie if you're drinking with friends because you will have a laugh, just don't watch it if you're looking for a horror movie.I really like the gimmick of this movie. It's pretty interesting and I would love to see it be explored more, with a different cast and director. The actual story itself was very poorly written. Character's are stupid and this makes it very hard to care about them. A lot of the things that happen in this movie make no sense and the deaths itself contain no logic behind them. I understand they tried to excuse it but there should still be logic and setup to each kill to justify it. Maybe even include red herrings; keep the viewer guessing. Another flaw with the deaths is how generic and boring they are. Needless gore and violence is the one thing I would remove from movies today if I could; it's sick and never works. That said, I would have actually liked to see more creativity and thought put into the deaths. Keep it comic violence and make the movie a full blown comedy; that'd be fun.The only performance in this movie that wasn't completely robotic and forgettable was Kristen Cloke as Valerie Lewton. Even that performance was just barely passable. The rest of the acting was pathetic. Devon Sawa was shocking, Ali Larter was abysmal, Kerr Smith tried but failed - no one impressed me and only one person barely escaped my scold. Every movie like this were the cast are getting picked off one by one needs to include likable characters to make me want them to live or an interesting antagonist to make the deaths interesting. This movie succeeds at neither. The characters are dull, bland and forgettable, and the antagonist(I won't spoil it) doesn't appear for the entirety of the movie. This lack of good characters makes me actively dislike the characters and means I don't care if they die which means I have lesser interest in the movie.This movie hit the trifecta of trashy cinematography. It was badly lit, shot and edited. Nothing in this movie is technically proficient. The effects are also atrocious. I don't care if it was made in the year 2000, realistic dinosaurs were made in 1993.This movie was not at all frightening(if anything, it was comedic). I laughed a lot in this movie due to the clich√©s and lack of genuinely frightening moments. There is a scene towards the end were I should have been on the edge of my seat but I was on the verge of crying with laughter. For what this movie is attempting to do, it fails. But for sheer entertainment value, I'll recommend this movie. Watch it with some friends. I'll rate it 3 Expert Getaway Strategies out of 10.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

Originally, ""Death"" was inhabiting the body of ""someone"" and was killing off the survivors of Flight 180 in the order they would have died on the plane crash (which is similar to the film), and the survivors were trying to figure out who the killer was before they died.

Interesting idea that falls short,"It's an interesting idea to create a movie about a bunch of people who escape death and destiny keeps coming after them, trying to kill them. A hell of a lot more original than most thrillers/horror movies now days right. Final Destination takes that idea and falls short because of it's stupidity. There many plot holes and the script is poor at best. What's just as bad is most of the characters are just bone heads. On the positive side there are some dramatic scenes that are exciting and original that leave you somewhat satisfied after the fact. However, those can't quite make up for it's faults. Hard core horror movie fans, which I'm not, will probably apreciate this film more than I did, given the fact it's well above the average of today's horror flicks.

Can you cheat death?,"When seven passengers step off a plane just before it explodes, you can imagine they drew a little attention.  It turns out these seven individuals just cheated death.  One teen boy with a gift for seeing the Grim Reaper's plans becomes hysterical when seeing his own death and his schizo-behavior ends up getting six other passengers booted off the flight.  Little did they know how big a favor he did them.But shortly thereafter these survivors start to turn up dead.  It appears that Death wants his victims after all, no ""Pass Go, Collect $200"".

Death Has Never Been So Fun,"Final Destination has a lot of charm, which is crucial in the enjoyment of this movie. From the story to the acting, the slightly over the top nature of it all gives this film a special feel, in an otherwise standard flick. Although it's iconic in the genre, Final Destination does not really 'wow' with its first outing. While it has some captivating kills and an intriguing plot, it doesn't feel that it does as much as it could to creatively bring it all together and that feels mostly due to the runtime. Stretching it by a bit more to give some time to breathe might've made for a more fulfilling climax. Still, a charming start to an iconic franchise, with only time as its fault.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Nice and easy splasher with some novelties,"So in the wake of the Scream-trilogy and the 'Last Summer'-splashers another teen-splash movies hits the screen.The plot: A young teen has some inexplicable premonitions when boarding a plane with his class, gets panic and out of the plane, dragging some classmates (and a teacher) with him. Plane explodes in mid-air, and 'death' is trying to catch up and those who escaped the death pattern. All survivors (bar two ?!?) die in the following weeks and months some strange deaths.Comment: This movie is inspired firstly by a welcome impersonal death, not some sinister serial killer hiding behind masks. Death is announced by simple means, e.g. just by a gust of wind. Next are some real nice new ways to get killed, which leaves the audience shocked, but also laughing (especially the teacher's death is quite far-fetched and complicated in the build-up, to say the least). And the whole movie is driven forward by the 'Scream'-like lurking question: ""who's next?"" when the protagonists try to figure out the death pattern.Conclusion: A movie of no great impact, but some fun involved. Easy come, easy go. There are worst movies to spend your money on.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"So ridiculous, it was funny","I don't know what movie the others who have commented here were watching, but Final Destination was laughable.  I will admit that the film has a potentially good concept, but the movie spirals downward due to terrible dialogue and unrealistic actions by the various players.Several times, I found myself laughing out loud, thinking, ""No one would actually act like that in real life!""It's a shame this movie was so poorly done, because this plot had the makings of a very interesting film.Horrible movie.

A Nutshell Review: Final Destination,"I watched Final Destination 3 without watching the first two, so thanks to DVDs, I'm going to make amends. The most I know about the first Final Destination was that explosion onboard an aircraft was one of the most realistic ever, and probably had this movie banned from inflight entertainment systems.Alex Chance Browning (Devon Sawa) has a fear of flights, and in his class outing to Paris, he had a premonition about the flight going boom, and created enough a ruckus to have him thrown out of the plane, together with a few of his friends and teacher. Naturally he becomes guilt ridden, and prime suspect when the plane explodes mid-air without a clue as to why (following the actual TWA flight 800). Together with Clear Rivers (what a name, played by Ali Larter), they discover that if they were destined to die in that flight, then Death will soon be on his way to complete his mission, in the order that they were supposed to go.It brings to mind that our deaths are probably pre-ordained the moment we are born, and death has designed the way we have to go too. The premise is that should you beat that design, then you get a second chance. But are we up to that? Nope, because we want to see how the cardboard characters get sent on their way. However, the deaths presented here aren't really horrific or designed with grandeur, probably because they don't age so well over time. They do seem rather gimmicky in today's context.Not expecting an adrenaline rush each time the characters die or beat death, the plot does get slowed down because of the romance bit between Alex and Clear (and most ended up on the cutting room floor), so they do come across pretty jarringly. And the group size for death is relatively small, so you don't go beyond that number, including survivors. It's a pretty decent thriller, but a reminder that the nature of these thrillers is that they age quite badly over time.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The young people out there will love this, I am sure.","Another teen horror flick in the wake of ""Scream 3"" written by the guys who put the creepy in the X-Files. Sounds like a wild ride or is it? The story centers around a group of teens who survive an airliner explosion through a bizarre incident. After the crash, one teen (Devon Sawa) becomes completely convinced that the Grim Reaper is after him and he is hunting the group in the way they should have died in the explosion. Producer, co-screenwriter, and director James Wong re-teams with his partner Glen Morgan for a stab at the silver screen. Morgan and Wong's greatest exploit has to have been the couple seasons of the X-Files where it became the staple for TV suspense and to this day the series is still trying to recapture. They have continue to dabble in TV with such series as the little seen but at times brilliant ""Space: Above and Beyond"" and NBC's recent hit ""The Others"". But with the debut of ""Final Destination it's the team's first real venture onto the silver screen. Destination starts off with a great opening 20 minutes where we are shocked and dumbfounded by the opening plot. I haven't seen that thrilling of a plane disaster scene since 1993's ""Alive"". Wow, what a scene. And as the film moves along a lot of the scenes are shocking and keep you on your toes. But it's the latter half of the film that bugged me. The time I am talking about is just when ex-Hollywood sex symbol Ali Larter's hair starts to get blonder. Ever notice that in Hollywood films they always dumb down the leading lady until she is supposed to catch the hero's eye? It's at that point that Sawa's avoidance of the Grim Reaper get really hokey. That cabin scene is a perfect example. Every movie like this needs a supernatural ending and the finale here is gimmickry and unrealistic. If you love the humor-horror trilogy of ""Scream"" like so many million people then Destination has all that to offer but watch out for a couple goofy things along the way.  I guess other ""Scream"" clone ""I Know What You Did this Summer"" and especially its sequel got this back lash too. The young people out there will love this, I am sure.

A new twist on the slasher flick!,"Final Destination is your average run-of-the-mill teen horror movie, but with one key difference from most; a rather unique premise.Having had a premonition that the flight he is boarding will blow up, Alex (Devon Sawa) causes panic by telling the plane, forcing the airline to disembark him and several other people. When the plane really does blow up soon after take-off, the FBI become convinced he caused the explosion. But they aren't the only ones on the survivors' tail. Death is also after them, and is determined to claim the souls that cheated it on the plane, and one by one they begin to die in bizarre and increasingly bloody accidents.The film is simply far too ridiculous for words. But that is part of the fun ¬ñ trying to figure out exactly what series of morbid co-incidences will lead to a gruesome death., and who will be next. But to compensate for this originality, the characters are all straight out of school clich√©s 101; the jock, the kook, the nerd, the princess ¬ñ they might as well have cast the kids from The Breakfast Club! But what is interesting about the casting is some playing against type ¬ñ most notably Seann William Scott as a nerd and Ali Larter considerably dressed down as the kook, while Kerr Smith enjoys a change of pace from his role as gay Jack as the jerk jock. The acting is all steady but never spectacular, except for a brief cameo by Tony Todd of Candyman fame who manages to steal the film from just a couple of minutes screen-time as a creepy morgue worker.Certainly more original than any of the other major teen horror flick franchises doing the rounds such as Jeepers Creepers, and definitely worth a watch.

Falls apart more than my car,"Final Destination is the most frustrating of all movies.  It has a great premise, some truly scary moments, reasonably talented actors, but it just can't hold it's momentum.  The first hour here is good, than it just gets goofy.  People die in truly insane ways.  One character is stabbed, has her throat cut by glass from an exploding computer, and is then blown up. What should be a terrifying moment turns into a hilarious example of all that is wrong with modern horror.  Nothing subtle in this movie.  Even features a decapitation, easily the least scary cliche in the genre.  Every time the film really starts to gain speed, it falls apart with some stupid gory death that pushes the limits of plausibility.  Good horror is always based in reality, this movie just gets too silly to take seriously.  They do get points, however, for never showing us ""death.""  I was pleasantly surprised to not see anyone in a mask.  For a film that successfully works this premise check out the 1960's masterpiece Carnival of Souls, ignore this dreck.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A top notch thriller , blasted with gore and suspense","Now i have seen all the final destination movies date and it all comes back to the original which is clearly the best , the others are good but the concept is just too familiar they didn't introduce any new ideas weather as this one was the first , and when theirs a long line of movies , the first one is always the best (e.g) saw, nightmare on elm street, Halloween, Friday the thirteenth , their all the same.Back to the film, after all of that ranting the film in my opinion is still one of the best thrillers to date , however its not scary as such just lots of teenagers getting slaughtered , which is pretty amusing. the plot line is one of the most clever dilemmas seen in recent movies and will leave you on the edge of your seat the entire film from beginning to end. The characters were amazing, theirs a real connection between them and the audience. A master thriller , packed with gore and suspense.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A terrific scare show.,"My Take: One of the spookier and more creative horror movies today.In watching a horror flick, there are two things that I would expect. Either it's a true scare ride that makes me want to run for cover or shows true moments of uniqueness for its genre that it is scary. Both pleasure are in the slasher flick FINAL DESTINATION, which is surprisingly more creative and stylishly spooky than other ""hack-and-slash"" horror/slasher yarns. Although the characters are the usual teenagers served up for slaughter, they do a very terrific job in setting us up for a scare, and doesn't disappoint when it comes to their delivery.Devon Sawa's character is named Alex, who has some strange premonitions of doom when boarding a plane to France. When on board, Alex had a realistic daydream of doom and began yelling out ""This plane will explode at take-off."" This part gets a little wild. Hold on! It gets real serious when the plane DOES explode. His fellow French class members and school teacher manages to get out before the plane exploded, but are now, death has a new ""design"" for them. Obviously, death doesn't take no for an answer.Perhaps the best things and most likely the biggest reason viewers (especially horror buffs and teenagers) to watch FINAL DESTINATION are the really good quality kills. I mean, if you want to get rid of that teenager, who knows that their doom is at hand, why not do it with some style? This film has some very creative death sequences which might be one of the best I've seen in a horror film since the ones in THE OMEN series. Sure the possibility of that happening to you can only happen in a move, but this is a movie, right? Cinematic, indeed, but very, very creative.Sure it features teenage characters that are not given any personality, but in this kind of film, which is just made to kill off the teenagers quick (and good), I don't think it needs time to develop its characters. The film isn't good on the cerebral basis (in other words, it's sometimes isn't smart), but the storyline has some very neat ideas (like the death sequences) and director James Wong does a great job making it to a wild ride. I was so surprised how I liked this film (both as a stylish or a ""run for cover"" horror flick). FINAL DESTINATION is a terrific scare show.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Death Has a Design That Can Be Changed,"The movie has an interesting premise: A high school student, aboard an airplane and waiting to depart on his French classes' flight to Paris, has a premonition: a ghastly vision of an explosion. He then raises a commotion and bolts from the craft. A few minutes later the plane explodes in midair just after takeoff, killing everyone aboard. The view from the terminal is terrific, with glass shattering everywhere.The young man and six others ‚Äì who have disembarked during the turmoil ‚Äì have cheated death, but death, though unfeeling, hates to be cheated. And so for the rest of the movie death stalks the survivors, and picks them off one by one. Meanwhile the main character tries to figure out the death patterns to stay ahead of fate. As a mortician later tells Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) and sympathizing friend Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), ""The risk of cheating the plan, of disrespecting the design, could incite a fury that could terrorize even the Grim Reaper.""The whole feeling is one of doom, that something is out to get you, as writer Mark Twain thought of his family tragedies. Inanimate objects turn against people, like water, wind, electrical wires, vodka, gas cans, knives, lanterns, fish hooks, candles, a garage- door opener, etc. And folks die in various ways, like an elaborate strangulation, decapitation, traffic accident, fire, etc. When John Denver's tune, ""Rocky Mountain High"" is played, watch out for a falling sign! So we have a bizarre chain of connected events, like a Rube Goldberg machine. In the early 20th century Goldberg created cartoons for newspapers that depicted complicated gadgets that performed tasks in complex ways.FBI agents and others think that Alex is some kind of freak, especially because of his theories about death's design. The last half of the film focuses on Alex's increasing paranoia and precautions, like his opening of tin cans while wearing heavy gloves lest he should severely cut himself and get blood-poison. His lit candles are placed in water bowls as protection against an ill wind that may knock them over.Despite an interesting story-line, the film has its negatives. For one, the acting is just so-so, especially with co-lead Ali Larter. In addition, this morphs into just another horror film. Also, there are the plot flaws. One may say, ""Why save someone's life as he will be doomed anyway?"" You may come to the same conclusion by adding, ""Why do we have doctors?"" Nevertheless Director James Wong's concept was popular enough with teen viewers so that four sequels were produced. But the characters were mostly created just to be knocked off, although not quite as badly as those in the ""Friday the Thirteenth"" series. You may be entertained by it.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Entertaining to sucks.,"I have to say this. I am a big time movie critic. When I say big, I don't mean famous. I just know what's good, especially in ""Horror Films"".

It doesn't matter who's next! Because were all on the same list!,"**SPOILER ALERT** When 17 year old high school student Alex Browning, Devon Sawa, gets a sudden premonition of being killed, together with passengers and crew, on flight 180 from NY to Paris his actions leads to some of his fellow passengers to bolt from the plane in feeling that he may well be on to something. As fate would have it flight 180 explodes, just like Alex predicted, and crashes in flames in the Atlantic Ocean just minutes after it took off!It's later that Alex realizes that somehow he and those who left the plane with him cheated death's grand plan that it had in store for them on flight 180. With the exception of Terry (Amanda Detmer), one of these who left flight 180 before it took off, the rest of those survivors who were later killed died in a number of complicated Rube Goldburg-like scenarios that took as much as five minutes to finally snuff them out.Alex somehow figures out, by watching the news of the plane crash on TV, the path of the explosion on the plane that hit the very seats that he and the other survivors of the plane crash were assigned to! And with that Alex could now predict, by the sequence of who's seat on the plane the fireball first hit, who'll among those who survived will be the next persons to die. This of course has everyone, including the local police and FBI, feel that Alex was somehow responsible for the taking down of flight 180! But just how he could have known that the plane was going to crash is anyone's guess! Was it sabotage? Was it that Alex knew that there was a bomb planted on the plane by terrorists? Or the most obvious explanation, and at the same time least scientific, is it that Alex could really see into the future and thus saw what was going to happen to flight 180 far, like 10 minutes, in advance!***SPOILERS*** The film starts to get a bit off base even in its storyline in the sequences of those who are to be killed, according to the explosion pattern on the doomed plane, that you get lost watching it. Alex for all his proved paranormal powers is totally ineffective in convincing anyone of those targeted by death-until it's almost too ate-that the end for them is going to come and come real soon. Pretty good horror/thriller even though it's, seeing one's death in the future, been done dozens of times before but never with-the mind-boggling death scenes-the ingenuity that's in it!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

An original idea that works,"The plot = Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) along with his classmates are about to take a school trip to Paris, but Alex has a premonition that the plane crashes, so he and a handful of people leave the plane, it crashes, thinking that they've escaped near death, an unseen force known as death starts killing off the survivors one by one.I remember going to see this movie in the cinema many years ago and never thought that this would start off a franchise. ""Final Destination"" is a really good movie and gives an almost entirely original concept. An unseen killing force known as death killing off the teens with tragic and nasty accidents. Okay I wasn't sold on the idea at first, as I'm old fashioned and prefer a straight up standard slasher, but when I saw this movie, I really enjoyed it.Coming out at a time when the second slasher boom was starting to wane, ""Final Destination"" breathed new life into the genre. Okay it's a little slow to start off, but as it goes on it really kicks in and doesn't become predictable as the death scenes are accidents and could really happen making it suspenseful.Another aspect that works is the cast, all of which give really good performances, not a bad one in sight which again is really rare in these types of movies. Devon Sawa was excellent as the lead, he manages to be sympathetic and convincing at the same time, pity he never did quite become a star after this. Ali Larter gives a well rounded performance as the female lead and plus has great chemistry with Devon Sawa. Kerr Smith plays the asshole jock really well. Kristen Cloke plays the teacher really well and makes you feel for her when her time comes, she should have had more screen time and Tony Todd was genuinely creepy in his small cameo role, it's always fun to see him in anything.All in all A really good movie with an original idea that works for a change and an excellent cast really sums it up.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
1 Hour And 38 Minutes Of Pure Entertainment,"5 September 2000I missed this movie when it was in the cinema. I didn't have enough time to go see it because it came out a couple weeks before the end of the school term. Thankfully now that I have a copy of the DVD I can watch it and overall it's actually pretty good.It portrays itself as a horror movie with some teens dying one after the other but it's smarter than that because it comes up with an interesting premise that will grip you. Originality barely exists in this specific genre of horror but this movie has that and owns it.Alex (Devon Sawa) is a young adult who can anticipate the deaths of others before it actually occurs. When his class take a trip to France, he has a premonition of the plane crashing. He quickly gets off the plane with the teacher and a few other students. Whilst everyone else is on board, the plane takes off but a few seconds after, the plane crashes. The students who left the plane just in time were supposed to die, they cheated death but not for long. A pattern is discovered showing the order in which the students will die.The deaths in this movie can be very brutal and are taken very seriously. The viewer wants to protect Alex from being accused of the murders by the police. The story is entertaining, there is not a second to lose, it's fast paced and keeps you attentive.I really enjoyed the movie, the performances were good and the high energy of the movie was present throughout it's entire runtime. It definitely stands out in the teen horror movie genre for taking chances in presenting the audience a well thought out plot. It's a good summer movie. It's a popcorn movie though and there's nothing wrong with that because it's a good one and that's why it's getting a good audience and critical reception. I recommend Final Destination.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good one!,"A very enjoyable horror flick - well worth the price of admission. Comparisons with the Scream series aren't really appropriate though, as although there are a few moments of black humour in Final Destination, the emphasis is on mystery and suspense. I think the film's strongest point is that it really never lets on exactly where it's going, even at the end. (OK, that could be said of a lot of films, but in Final's case, it's intentional!) It kept me on the edge of my seat more for this reason than for any shock/horror value (although there are a few gory moments, but these don't dominate the film). Probably the most lasting effect the film will have on you is to make you very nervous about getting out of bed in the morning...",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ali Larter is a cutie,"Promising more than it can deliver, Final Destination opens with a bang but irreversibility splutters along for the majority of its run time.The script and acting are both contrived even though I couldn't take my eyes off Ali Larter as Clear, one of the main characters who makes it to the end in one piece. It really has a look and feel of not wanting to let go of the corny 80s and 90s and I was unsure if I was meant to treat it all like a joke or something serious.The special effects are impressive, particularly in the aircrash scenes and the action and kill scenes are exciting and artfully created but other than that there isn't much else to applaud where the attempts at humour mixed in with grisly deaths don't work very well. Most of the characters are flippant and oddly unaware of their situations until it's too late and all in all, it's pretty poorly executed, leaving me feeling at the end like, oh well that wasn't particularly great. Still, there is some fun to be had here, just not as much I would have liked.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Final Desparation,"I have to disagree with the positive reviews. The truth is that Final Destination is irredeemably bad and isn't even comparable to the pretty average Urban Legend, let alone the wonderful Scream trilogy.Final Destination, like Scream and its imitators, has people dying in a variety of gory ways that make people laugh; unlike Scream, it doesn't seem to be in on the joke that people are laughing because they're so badly executed.Let's be honest: there's barely a plot, there's no humour and the special effects are pretty unremarkable. The cast is absolutely minimally talented (the guy from Dawson's Creek can't even convincingly play a one-dimensional character) and there's no attempt at character development. Plot holes are legion: if Clear Rivers's parents are both dead, who's been her legal guardian through school - and whose stuff is it that's all through her house in the background? At no point in the film do you seel sympathy for or interest in any of the characters.Go and rent Scream again instead - even if you're already seen it a thousand times, it'll still be more satisfying than this vapid tosh.",,Anonymous,Horror

Alex and the help of his friend, Clear, has to find out when will Death starts to kill them, next.This is one of your smarter teenage slasher films. No, it's no where like a killer chasing and killing people. But yes, it has a lot of violence. It's Death, in which you can't stop what's happening in part of life. The acting by Devon Sawa and Ali Larter were decent at best.This movie has a very elaborate concept, in which many horror movies do not. The deaths in the movie are even foreshadowed through clues, which makes you want to look for them. You would even have to pay attention to easter eggs, like the fact that before each person dies, the same song is played.Some deaths in the film are good, but many are more of a let down, since you ""might"" want them more violent. Still, they are pretty creative. I like the weird score by the composer, which gives a brooding effect through the film.This is a smart but not a scary movie, for me at least. The deaths are good in this movie but they're not great. If you are tired of regular slasher movies where a killer kills people, then watch this movie and you'll like it.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Tries hard, but doesn't quite make it","'Final destination' starts out very fine indeed! From the ominous title-sequence, accompanied by Shirley Walkers effective score, until the inventive first murder, the atmosphere is thick with foreboding and threatening omens. And the airplane accident must surely be the most terrifying ever to be put onto celluloid! Scary stuff, to be sure!!! However, the movie goes downhill from there. The murders become more and more unconvincingly contrived (the bus-accident is a very well handled shock, though) and characters, grown-ups as well as adolescents, behave increasingly silly. Anyway, it's well above average for this kind of horror-thriller even if the final isn't as surprising as the filmmakers probably intended. Competent all the way with an unusual premise to begin with and, above all, a very nice surprise from a genre that seemed to have outlived itself after all the latest Screamclones.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Unique, bizarre and strangely entertaining","Ordinarily, a cheap and trashy film with a silly plot and weak script would be enough keep most people, myself included, away. 'Final Destination', however, more than makes up for these flaws in sheer entertainment value. The first time I saw this film many years ago, I enjoyed it enough to buy the DVD, and it has remained something of a guilty pleasure all this time.Some films try way too hard to tick all the boxes and create the perfect picture, when sometimes all that's needed is an original, unique idea and enough imagination to put it into practice. That's exactly what 'Final Destination' is - someones imagination let loose, with the end result a highly flawed, but highly entertaining film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Only visions I ever see are more slasher movies...,"It looks like an interesting movie, doesn't it? High-school kid has horrible vision of an exploding plane while his plane's sitting on the runway, freaks out, and leaves the plane, taking a few classmates and a teacher with him. Boom! Plane explodes. Did the kid save them, or is he just off his rocker? Don't look for anyone you recognize in the cast. I've watched about a billion movies, and I recognized only the last guy I listed up there (Tony Todd, from Candyman). Basically, this is a movie in the young-people-scared-out-of-their-wits vein that was popularized with the Scream films. This one, fortunately, is well-written, albeit with some plot holes. Still, it's an intriguing premise. Does Death have a plan for each of us? If so, then this kid's act of getting people off the plane screwed it up royally, and now Death's really ticked off and - surprise! - one by one, the survivors are picked off. But this is a tiny cut about the standard people-being-killed-one-by-one movie. It's not just a matter of how people are killed in this movie; that would be the easy, tried-and-true method. In Final Destination, the fun is in figuring out who's next, and if the premise is to be believed (that Death does have a plan), then the mystery of who is supposed to die next will keep you guessing. There's some pleasure in figuring out who's next, since there are some characters you kind of hope get it sooner rather than later. That said, the acting is nothing to speak of - rather bland, really - and the direction itself is really bad. But the story's interesting and the effects, gory as they are, are frighteningly realistic. PRO: Story, effects. You want blood, you got it! CON: Acting, directing, effects. This is NOT for squeamish people. My score: 6",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Boy vs. Death...free will against destined fate...hmmm,"It's hard to explain exactly what I think of this film. If it can be placed under the category of teen slasher horror type flick (along with the ""Scream"" trilogy, ""I Know What You Did Last Summer,"" ""Urban Legends,"" and ""The Faculty""), then I'd have to admit it performed very well. Otherwise, if that is not what you are looking for, then just don't see it.However, ""Final Destination"" gives a new twist to the genre (introduced by the tag line ""You can't cheat death"") by attacking and terrorizing the characters with a killer that absolutely cannot be killed (or stopped, as you will see in the end). And since the killer is not really human, the deaths don't necessarily have to be realistic (anything short of completely unbelievable is an understatement), which is actually somewhat refreshing; it forces you to kind of use your imagination; and if you can't, it provides the pretty (read: gory and bloody) pictures for you.The main principles by which the characters follow regarding ""Death's Design"" was reminiscent of John Calvin's belief of predestination which ignited during the Protestant Reformation. This belief was that God decided in advance who lives and who dies. The movie reconstructs this idea very well, and even leaves you wondering whether they were right about Death's Design or whether they were just following the plan all along.Other than all that, the film proves exciting through the end (you will NOT be bored), because as we all know, Death is relentless. People may complain about the ridiculous dialogue (which it has, but that's not what this genre is popular for) or about the idiotic actions of characters (which they are, but that is all too common and expected in slasher films), or the supernatural causes of death (which is what will make this movie memorable longer than Scream), but overall it does exactly what movies of this genre are supposed to do: scare you--scare you because you don't know who's going to die, and scare you even more if you do.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Might keep you entertained for an afternoon, but at the stupidity at the characters who drive the plot","I was lying in my room bored out of my mind. The weather outside was a bit crappy and I decided to see what movies I could stream from Netflix. Final Destination was on my page, so I decided to watch that.So, the movie starts out with a French class on a plane. One kid ""sees"" the plane blow up, and is thrown off of the plane for inciting panic. Several other students leave with him, including one girl who left simply because she believed him. In the terminal, they watch as the plane does explode. It's interesting thinking about this in a post-911 world. The kids are interviewed about the event and then let go after about 3 hours. They know that the kid was yelling about the plane exploding, so why didn't they hold him for longer. If that had happened now, that kid would have been detained for days before they determined he was innocent, if they ever did that at all. What follows seems like a typical slasher movie, just without an actual slasher. The antagonist is supposed to be an abstract concept like fate or death, but it's really just a shadowy Michael Myers or Jason.Now seems like a good time to talk about the characters. They suck. Throughout the beginning of the movie, the survivors are giving the psychic kid(I have a hard time paying attention to names in movies) a hard time about predicting the explosion. I don't have much experience with death, but does this make any sense? I would expect them to be grieved, maybe even happy to be alive, but why would you target the guy that saved you? It doesn't make sense. There is also the girl who got off the plane because she believed him. She talks to him about believing him, and even believes him when the first guy died. However, after they establish that it wasn't a suicide, something that everyone else was saying, she suddenly stops believing him. Why? He made a prediction of his death, said it wasn't a suicide, this was confirmed, so you stop believing him? Idiot.I can go on forever about the crappy characters in this movie. The stupid motives for driving like an idiot, the complete lack of any valid emotion after one of your friends is decapitated, and the convoluted cabin near death scene that occurred right before the main character decides that it shouldn't have.If you're bored, you might get a kick out of watching it for the shear stupidity. But if you are expecting an interesting supernatural thriller, skip this one like it's death was just prevented.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Death has a shadow.,"What if death was a killer? In some ways, I suppose, that's the premise of 'Final Destination (2000)', a portentous picture that paints death as a silent slasher that uses coincidence and wind instead of a mask and a machete. The idea that any of us could die at any moment is truly terrifying, and the flick initially feels as though it's going to capitalise on this fear with its deadly domino effects and inescapable nature. However, it personifies the invisible force at its centre a bit too much, even implying that the grim reaper looks a lot like the Candyman. Its antagonist is an explicitly supernatural entity with wants and needs, rather than an unknowable enigma that naturally occurs, which undeniably dilutes the effectiveness of the plot's 'death is all around us' premise. The concept that all these deaths are actually classed as natural occurrences, horrific accidents rather than specific slayings, is pretty potent in its purest form. At times, this combines with the flick's genuine sense of impending doom - the sort that marks even the simplest of moments as signs of immense suffering yet to be - to create a rather arresting and unsettling atmosphere. Ultimately, though, it dampens its own concept with the aforementioned personification of its 'villain' and the silliness of some, scratch that, most of its set-pieces. Still, that doesn't mean it isn't effective as an enjoyably pulpy affair. It has some interesting ideas, a handful of entertaining sequences and a surprisingly successful first act. It's quite a bit of fun, to be fair, even if it isn't exactly great.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
I don't even have words to describe this trash flick,"Well, I just came back from seeing this film and I must say, it sucked. It's just another teen ""slasher"" film to follow in the ""Scream"" tradition: a bunch of dumb teenagers played by no-name actors and actresses get slashed in various, grotesque ways. Is that all Hollywood can think of anymore? This movie just makes me want to watch ""Halloween"" or ""The Exorcist"" even more. Those films are what true terror is all about. It also saddens me that James Wong, and the rest of his crew had to exploit a very sad and tragic disaster that was TWA Flight 800 in order to make this movie a ""hit"", and if people can't see that the first 20 minutes of the movie were based on that disaster, open your eyes.

Satisfying Schlock,"Final Destination is satisfying schlock. The premise is silly but fun, and the craftsmanship is actually pretty solid, especially for a movie like this. There is some weak acting (namely, Kristen Cloke) and the music is occasionally distracting, but that is mostly forgivable because other techniques are implemented. Specifically, the camerawork is surprisingly engaged: plenty of movement and a variety of shots keep the visuals active. There are moments of abstract sound design that help set an eerie mood. There is even a match cut transition early on that is quite pleasant. Plus, a variety of special effects are used, which is always refreshing (the CGI hasn't aged well but everything else generally works).Some movies aren't trying to be much more than shallow entertainment and that is okay. Final Destination might not be enlightening or even make much sense, but it does accomplish its goals of excitement and gratuitous kills. For that alone, it is a fair experience. Yet, because Final Destination is competently executed on a technical level, it is more than a one-trick pony. Therefore, even though Final Destination clearly isn't high art, it does land as an amusing piece of pop culture.Writing: 6/10

Cheating death,"The movie Final Destination (2000) has a simple premise and people remember it. The idea of cheating death and death trying to kill you sounds interesting and they use it well with the many ways someone can die using convoluted ways.The acting is fine for what the movie is going for, and you can follow the main character having premonitions about who will die next. Some of the characters can be annoying sometimes but you get used to it as the movie goes on, while waiting for the death scenes.The death scenes are cool in how they play out, even though they are simple looking. To me, I feel like the death scenes were caused by the characters and having them make dumb decisions that lead to their deaths.The movie Final Destination (2000) is a simple thriller that a lot of people can enjoy watching, if you like this kind of movie.

Final Destination (2000),"I can't believe this film is 11 years old. This must be one of the most enjoyable cinematic experiences I've ever had, and certainly one of the most memorable. Being 15 and seeing these cartoon death scenes in live action with gratuitous gore was awesome. I've decided to revisit the franchise and this film still holds up. There's great build up towards the opening disaster. It's filled with dread, even after having seen it so many times. The film is brilliant in that death is an unseen entity, you can't outrun it. As the death toll increases, the paranoia sets in. It also has some excellent moments of comedy without ever getting so stupid. Most importantly, we can actually care for some of these characters. They are not kept in this insular vacuum either. The FBI do take notice, but aren't trying to terrify these kids. It's weird, funny, and a little frightening. Perfect late night entertainment.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Faces of Death, But Not Really","What is most admirable about this film is that it manages to mix themes of the typical horror and teen film with the blunt reality of sudden and unavoidable death. It broaches the subject of sudden teen death with about as much philosophy and flare as it happens in real life; not much. Sometimes death happens through no fault of their own, and the characters are left picking up the pieces as their high school years come to an end. In a way the film is a metaphor for end of the turbulent years of dances, football games, cafeteria anxieties, and study hall sessions, and the cruel realities that await wide-eyed teens after their 'golden years' come to an end.

The dialogue, especially the responses of the characters, is just so unrealistic that the movie becomes laughable.

Nothing is certain but death and sequels.,"Final Destination sees a group of students narrowly avoid being blown to smithereens in an airplane disaster after one of their number, Alex (Devon Sawa), witnesses the catastrophe in a vision minutes before it actually happens. Miffed at being cheated, Death decides to have another pop at each of the survivors, claiming them in the order they would have died in the midair explosion.This simple yet ingenious concept allows director James Wong to deliver a series of intricately designed and wonderfully imaginative death set-pieces that make this film one of the most genuinely entertaining and original horrors of the decade; not since The Omen films has violent death been so imaginatively planned and so much fun to watch unfold.As each victim reaches the top of Death's hit list, seemingly insignificant incidents cause a snowball effect that ultimately results in a horrific demise: a leaky toilet pipe winds up causing a guy to choke to death in his bathtub; a tiny crack in a mug kick-starts a chain of events that climaxes in a huge explosion; and a train hurtling past a piece of debris makes another poor schmuck lose his head (although not completely‚Äîjust from the lower jaw upwards!).In an exciting final√©, Alex attempts to end the terror by trying to cheat death once again, only to realise that he has got the order all wrong, and it is pretty social outcast Clear (the lovely Ali Larter from Heroes) who is next up for the chop...With spectacularly gory deaths, a very likable and talented young cast, a dark sense of humour, a cool cameo from Tony 'Candyman' Todd, and a totally unique killer, Final Destination goes to prove that not all big budget, major-studio, teen-orientated horror is totally worthless garbage.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Excellent story, could have easily been a masterpiece with better direction.","While being a devout Horror fan for over a decade, I must sadly confess that I've missed out on many of the classics, by which I mean that even if I did end up eventually watching them, I was far too old to really appreciate them (and have thus lost most of the scare-effect in classics such as Children of the Corn, The Omen, Village of the Damned, and don't even get me started on Chucky). Thankfully, Final Destination is simply an excellent film, and therefore immortal.The story altogether is original and compelling, showing a teenager which an obvious fear of flights getting a premonition of his plain bursting into flames. Thus he discovers his power to comprehend and anticipate death's ""pattern"", thereby avoiding it. What he doesn't realize before it's too late is that nobody cheats death. At first the story feels a little mixed up and not too well presented, even considering director James Wong's former known project (The X Files). With no build up whatsoever, the unfolding of the story feels like a long episode of the cult series, for better or for worse. Also, certain parts of the story are simply left out, and the audience is left with the sole option of figuring things out relying on later scenes. While not a dire shortcoming - this still feels amateurish and bluntly unnecessary, especially considering the few seconds it would have taken to set things right.Then there's the acting, or more appropriately the cast. As a huge fan of both SLC Punk and Idle Hands, I simply couldn't take Devon Sawa as a serious (even tragic) character. I kept half expecting the joke or wise crack to magically appear around him, and that's the last thing one would want while watching a Horror film. Luckily I'd never realized he played the role of Stan in Eminem's music video, or it would have been ruined for me too. I assume this is a personal problem, as Sawa is a great actor and performs beautifully, and yet. Then of course there's the slightly weird choice of casting Steven Stifler as Billy (which brings us to the question - why have a Billy in the first place? Such films have absolutely zero need for a comic relief, this is not a slasher parody). After his immortal performance in American Pie (and later Road Trip), even seeing his face in a Horror film severely damages the sensation of fear and suspense. Lastly, Kristen Cloke as Miss Lewton. Having a young high- school teacher is a risky move, and takes some talented maneuvering to pull off (for instance Drew Barrymore in Donnie Darco). Cloke, while obviously a talented actress following bad directing instructions, is far too timid and overdoes the whole damsel in distress routine. Having such a character as a teacher, after presented as strong and secure at first, felt unrealistic (yes, I realize she's been traumatized, yet as I've said - overdoing it).Then, of course, the ending, following a very weak plot twist (if it can even qualify as one) and being as predictable as one could imagine, and far too comical. If Sawa and Scott were too comic for my personal liking, the ending is simply too comical for the average Horror viewer. With such an ending as the wrapping paper, the entire project stinks of ""I want to be mainstream"". This is Horror... why try and be mainstream instead of trying to make a better film?Please understand, the reason I have so much concrete criticism isn't by far that Final Destination is a bad film. On the contrary, the original and innovative story (even today, 16 years later! Hats off to screenwriter Jeffrey Reddick) could and would have been enough to make this film a masterpiece. Sadly, all these bad choices by Wong turned what could have been an excellent film, to just a good film. Such potential gone to waste...All in all, I had a great time watching this. While obviously more Suspense than Horror, it's definitely one of the classics, and if at 30 and 16 years after its debut it still managed to leave such an impressive mark on me - I can't recommend it enough.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Death's Predestination,"""Final Destination"" is a riff on the Christian concept of predestination-the idea that God infallibly guides those who are destined for salvation.  In this film the idea is that all persons are infallibly predestined to die at a certain time in their life.The movie starts out promisingly.  A planeload of high school students and advisors are headed to Paris for a senior trip.  While waiting for the plane to take off, one of the students has some premonitions that they are going to crash.  He causes a commotion, and as a result six of the students and one advisor are kicked off the plane.  Then they watch in horror as the plane explodes after takeoff.Most people who don't die in a plane crash go through survivor's guilt.  But because they have cheated death, the seven survivors here must instead dodge all sorts of deadly mishaps.""Final Destination"" doesn't know whether to take itself seriously or not. Unlike the characters in ""Scream,"" who discuss horror film references while trying to dodge various slashers, the characters in ""Final Destination"" are not given a humorous moment.  ""Final Destination"" writers Jeffrey Reddick and Glen Morgan do name most of their characters after horror movie staples: Browning (after Tod Browning of ""Dracula"" and ""Freaks"" fame), Val Lewton (after the director of ""Cat People"") Shreck (after Max Shreck, star of ""Nosferatu"") Hitchcock, Chaney, and so on.  But my guess is the young people the film is targeting won't make the connection.It's hard to tell if whatever humor the movie has is intentional or not. When death targets the characters, so many bad things happen at once that I was reminded of the character in ""Li'l Abner"" who walked around under a cloud.  The main character keeps hearing the song ""Rocky Mountain High"" (because John Denver died in a plane crash) before someone is about to die, but at the end of the song is being played by a Paris street musician-not likely.In 1959 Rod Taylor starred in a ""Twilight Zone"" episode, ""And When the Sky Was Opened,"" as one of three astronauts who return from a trip to outer space, then discover they weren't supposed to survive.  When ""Final Destination"" began I was hoping it would move in the same direction as that episode.  Unfortunately, it doesn't.",,Anonymous,Horror

"A good horror film...no wait, I'm serious.","There's not a whole lot you can say about a film like Final Destination without giving too much away.  So this'll be short and sweet: Watch the movie.  That's all I really need to say, but since I usually say more than I need to, there's more.This movie crushes all other Teen Horror movies made in the past five years. It's refreshing to have a palatable sense of terror and urgency in the horror genre.  Instead of some guy in a fisherman's coat or spooky mask, they're running from Death.  You don't get a much more unconquerable foe than that.  And they didn't go through a whole lot of cheesy special effects to show you a Grim Reaper or Spectre of Death.  Just a change in the wind, a shadow in the background, a shimmer in the mood.  The filmmakers chose to heighten the tension by not showing the audience much, but leaving it up to their imagination to fill in the gaps.  And we all know the human imagination is the scariest thing out there.  Much more scary than a bladed glove or Al Pacino.Film-wise, it's pretty strong.  The acting ranges from ""as expected"" to ""surprisingly good,"" and the story gives enough plot turns to keep you in a state of confused disbelief.  The cinematography is refreshingly original, and is stylish without reeking of pretense.  The point of view shots disorient and clarify simultaneously, and the camera movement is quite slow compared to other contemporary horror films.  The absence of quick cuts and fast-moving camera sweeps is partly why this film is a treat to watch: all the benefits of modern technology without the migrane-inducing MTV style that seems so popular nowadays.  And before people start saying that old people can't understand the fast-paced world that young people live in, let me just say that I'm in my early twenties and I understand exactly the kind of fast-paced world that young people are living in.  I just don't like flash without urgency, which is MTV.  Final Destination is urgency without flash, and that's refreshing.I'm recommending this film to anyone who likes good Horror movies, and to those people who like bad Horror movies.  Perhaps it'll slap the latter group upside the head.  (7/10)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

If only it were fully incidental then the scope of reality would've been preserved, without having to lean on supernatural stuff. Acting was good, though, so is the plot.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A fresh idea wasted by countless flaws,"This film, which should have been something to really enjoy, was bordering on painful to watch very shortly into the story. While I praise the twists and turns of the script, there are just too many flaws with continuity, plausibility and lack of reality in much of the picture.  I realize that a lot of reality goes out the window for this kind of film, but still, when one watches with even a casual eye for detail, there are errors to be picked up.  My two cents are that the guys who put this out should try another one and hire a new script supervisor.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Innovative movie wasted on teen audience.,"In Final Destination the characters are all out to keep Death itself from finishing them off since they are supposed to have died anyways in a plane crash. Eerie premonitions, a plot that holds much potential, and a great atmosphere...all gone down the drain with the teen horror garbage. Instead of highly executed characters and a little more fleshing out, the film wastes everything to feed this thing to the gore-hungry teen audience. The issues of death and all its aftershocks could have been buttered up into a better movie overall if the studio had not cast a teen audience and set it among a high school crowd. For the benefit of the doubt there is one cardboard adult character who doesn't make it very long. The opening is flavored with enough eerie fingerfood to make you think you're in for a treat. But as soon as the plane goes kaboom, so does the film. After that, we look forward to whiny teens running around while Death hunts them down in more and more ridiculous ways. Take away the dressy plot and it boils down to nothing more than another slasher. We wait on end while the cast drops one by one. Actually, the death scenes are not the problem, it's the way they are set up and what's in between all the messiness. The characters who don't make it all die fascinating deaths. I use fascinating in the sense that a simple turn of events, the smallest detail, sets off a chain reaction that leads to a very bizarre ending for the unlucky survivors. Death never looked so stylish. Hell, these deaths are downright classy and sleek. Death in this film is like the shiny silver on the blade of a knife. But for all the eye-candy, the holes need to be covered up better. For one thing, why does the main character Alex have a premonition in the first place? Just so Death can play cat-and-mouse? And what's with the stock characters? It's really sad because beneath it's teen horror goofiness are the blueprints for a fine film. All they had to do was scrape off all the bubble gum. The film reaches heights when it deals with the survivors reactions to all the stuff happening to them, and their view on Death. The film touches on loneliness, fear, and rejection. A character study begun and not finished. In the end, it is all swept away for the Clearasil crowd.",,Anonymous,Horror
One of the smarter horror flicks in a crowded field,"In a crowded field of teen horror movies, it's a shame Final Destination didn't stand out more. It's well acted, well directed, and-- for the most part-- smartly written. Trouble is, it's inconsistent. Another problem is that ""Concept of Death"" is such a hard villain to root against (or for, if that's your taste).It's refreshing to see high school characters played by actors who could probably get carded-- for the most part. Devon Sawa was great in the lead and played his role straight.Ali Lerner is one to watch (um, professionally, I mean) though she was more engrossing in the sadly underrated ""House on Haunted Hill"" (a must-have film for horror collectors whose brief box office life I blame on ""The Haunting"" for souring audiences, but that's for another review).Tony Todd's performance as the mortician is fantastic, but it's too brief. He should have been used more, at least in more than one scene.Death has many ways of killing you in the bathroom, the kitchen, or on the street. You know people are going to die --and the writers know you know-- so the appeal is in ""how"" they get knocked off one by one. Glen Morgan and James Wong will treat you to some of the best red herrings in horror films, setting up so many ways to die that you're kept guessing.Sometimes it's over the top. The teacher's death was more like a bloody Wile E. Coyote nightmare, enough was enough. The final confrontation with death is intense but fun-- the teacher's death was comical and uninteresting.Kudos still go to Morgan and Wong for giving us a real storyline with real enough characters (I'd expect nothing less from the team that gave us Space: Above & Beyond), instead of the usual throwaway dialogue to fill time between killings. At times I wish the script had more balance of drama and horror, but they knew where the money was.And more kudos go to Wong for raising the bar on airplane disasters in films. The first 15 minutes of the film alone made me feel I got my money's worth.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
this is what a horror movie should be like...,"This was a positive surprise. I was nailed to the seat from beginning to end, getting chills, thrills and a few laughs. This is what horror movies should be like: scary, mystical and with a story-line worth spending money on. I like the premise: a teenager gets flashbacks of things that hasn't happened yet. He gets a few of his friends off a plane, convincing them of that the plane will explode. Unfortunately for the rest of his friends still on the plane, he's right. It blows up.The survivors think they're safe, but then freak accidents starts happening, making these persons less, less and less as time goes by. Soon there are only a few left. Who's going to live?It's a little predictable and I thought it was a little to explaining at times. But otherwise it is actually really good.

With all the little surprises waiting around every corner, you'll never become bored with this thriller which has been so cleverly injected with spots of humor.

The best of the four no doubt!,"With three sequels under it's belt and two main directors James Wong who did FD 1 and 3 and David Ellis who did 2 and 4. The Final Destination franchise has been an enjoyable one. The first is of the best no doubt. As a general occurrence in Hollywood movies whatever the genre the first if there are sequels will always be the best though some in recent years has reversed that assumption like Spiderman 2 and Lethal Weapon 2.Here though the first one is the best. James Wong directs this with skill and ease. He clearly knows his target demographics for this film horror fans and a teenage audience of fifteen years to early twenties. This being the case as all the main characters apart from one are teenagers. Looking at some of the reviews here FD has been highly criticised for a lot of aspects, which is fair enough as everyone has there own opinion. But let me tell you why this movie I give deserves a nine.First off the deaths are extremely inventive, there is plenty of gore so those with a weak stomach wouldn't like this. With the sequels the deaths though still gruesome aren't very scary and you more tended to laugh, but with the first one there are some genuinely scary moments that did throw me off balance like when the bus kills Terry Chaney (played by Amanda Detmer), that just scared the crap out of me. Also the start with the plane crashing in Alex's premonition had me on edge and arguably the scariest scene of the movie was when Alex and Clear go to see Todd's dead body and they run into the mortician played excellently by Tony Todd. Throughout there is plenty of suspense and tension helped by great music in whether the characters will survive. Also what is rare with your average horror flicks is any emotional connection to the characters. I cared about Alex and Clear and as they become a couple I hoped they would survive and Carter I hated him! Though the script and dialogue was a bit rubbish, it's easily forgiven. The acting is to a good standard particularly Devon Sawa as Alex and Ali Larter as Clear Rivers. The story is also original and different, which makes it refreshing and the ending is great. In referring to the ending I also loved the soundtrack when the credits rolled up. It was great. The special effects though obviously they would look bad now was good for it's time.That's why I think FD is a brilliant movie and deserves such a high rating and even though with each sequel they have been getting worse. FD will never lose it's touch and will remain for me the best of the franchise.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nerve-wracking horror movie,"This movie doesn't require much thought or analysis.  There's no secret ending to guess, like The Sixth Sense.  What Final Destination does is pull you to the edge of your seat and keep you there right through to the end.  If you're looking for nerve-wracking escapist fun, with a dash of shock-comedy, you'll love this movie.Devon Sawa is surprisingly good as a psychic highschooler trying to save the lives of his classmates by literally cheating death.  Ali Larter is perfect as an unhappy young woman who share's Sawa's vision.  (She's also a living doll.)Definitely give this one a try.",,Anonymous,Horror

An above average thriller/horror flick.,"Although it falls well short of anything by Poe or Hitchcock, ""Final Destination"" is somewhat more intelligent than most films of this genre. Apparently targeting the usual teen market, this commercial thriller gets off to a good start, then lags a bit as it wallows in the usual blood and guts, and finishes somewhat better. Sawa does a good job of not over acting, supporting acting is on par, and the special effects seem almost believable.

Impossible to believe that any of these things could actually happen.,"Maxine and I both agreed that some of the incidents that were supposed to be the work of some unseen force that pre-ordains the time and method of everyone's death, were so contrived as to be ""laughing-out-loud-hilarious""! This movie actually ""out-Keystoned"" Max Sennett's famous comedy team known as the Keystone Kops (most of you reading this are too awfully young to have even heard of the Keystone Kops but ""never mind"", because the Destination Final movies are much funnier than Max Sennett's gang could ever have been at their finest). Perhaps Pre-Ordained Death should be renamed Max Sennett, because his methods of making up for the cheating of Death, are truly preposterously hilarious. Suffice it to say that if you are in the bottom two-thirds of your class, you will probably find this comedy to your liking and you may even think it is scary. Horror films tend to appeal most to those who will never make it in the top ten-percent of their school's class and will believe that most impossible events are highly possible. This same comment fits Destination Final 2 and 3, also.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
A worthy creation,"""Final destination"", is a good movie, not a very good one, but a more than decent one, which leaves you wanting more of those freaky deaths.The story is very simple, a group of teenagers are saved by one of them, Alex, who had a premonition in which the plane blew up. He started screaming so that he and some of his friends are evacuated from the plane, which minutes after, literally, blows up. But then, death starts to hunt the survivors through horrific accidents, so that they die in the exact order, as they did in the boy's premonition. Well, as you see the story isn't lame at all, it's quite good, and really entertaining, at least as far as I'm concerned.The acting however, is quite bad, the actors were not very convincing as their characters, they looked more like some puppets waiting to be hacked up, if you ask me. Anyway I didn't expect high quality acting, so I wasn't disappointed, after all ""Final destination"" is just a teen horror, nothing more, than that.Even if it's primarily a horror, the movie made me laugh a little, it had a particular satiric side, which I liked. Seemed like death was punishing them unexpected, only when their ego showed off.All in all it was a nice flick. I rate it ***1/2 out of *****",,Anonymous,Horror
I do not think this is the Final Destination for this GREAT idea,"This movie is good people, you understand that. OK there are not big names in it nor in the cast, nor behind the chair, nor behind the pen, still it succeeds in doing something that I've have seen many films fail in over the years that featured big names. Of course I've seen failures with little names too, but that is not the point I'm trying to make here. The point I'm trying to make here is that how can a piece of sh.t movie like Mission to Mars be almost just as successful as this movie. I do not get it. I mean ,of course I thought, well, 'f.ck the reviews' and I went right on and saw Mission to Mars, but I wish I would not have. With this movie it was different, I was not too keen on going, actually I did NOT care if I saw it or not, because basically the Trailer was not too good and that is a pity. If the trailer would have been as good as the one for Mission to Mars (which had to be good, otherwise not so many people would have went to the cinema to watch that crappy movie), this film could have made 2 times the money it actually made at the box office.Another thing that I have to say here, is, that despite all the booing and wooing of the past about teenie / high school flicks I must say there certainly are a lot of them these days that are worth seeing. Of course these are not the 10 Things I hate about you flicks, but rather the films involving teens that are 'different'. Like Cruel Intentions, Scream, Scream 2 or last year's hit American Pie. There are really a bunch of great movies out there that centre teens and I feel that they are doing a great job. I mean these stories are not only better than some of the other stories out there, but they are really, definitely far better carried out. I mean two years ago or so, that The Avengers movie Trailer, it rocked, but what was the conclusion after watching it ? The film was carried out poorly. This one is actually a bit different, because the Trailer does not stand out, but the movie itself does, because it was carried out very good.On to the film itself, what was good and what was bad? Well bad there is not much to say there, actually there is nothing to say there. What was good, well let's get onto that in a bit, but first of all, what about the actors? Well they all get their job done and that is what counts, they are all good. No outstanding folks here, nor on the Oscar nor on the Razzie side. While I'm on it, I must say that the film was not too thrilling, meaning you don't sit on the edge of your seat the whole time, but it was still entertaining enough.On to the good stuff, what did I like ? Man that is like a thousand things. I liked the direction very much, for it was very well, not only angles and stuff, particularly in the death scenes, but also in the way of filming. I mean this film had not the biggest budget and yet it's effects are believable and good which is due to a style of direction that admits just the right amount of good effects to be there. Also, of course, a good thing when connected with direction was the editing. It was done at the right times and in good ways. The music was good too, I mean I never heard of the woman doing the music in this film before, but she got her sh.t together man, it was good. Now on to the film in particular, talking favourite scenes. My favourite scenes are the inside view of the exploding plane and deaths 2, 4 and of course 5. These are my favourite scenes, not only because they are carried out well but because they are somehow surprising (which counts only for the death scenes 2, 4 and 5). The surprise element is somehow too, the thing I liked very much in this film. You never knew exactly how someone was gonna die until it actually happened and even when you guessed it somehow was different than the most scenes I've seen in my life (that death scene 4 really surprised me in the way of how (the place) he was killed). Enough about the film and it's makers, what about the story ? It was not only inventive and new, but it also was smart, for it reflects a thought all humans have. Death is destiny and you can't escape death. OK there have been many films involving death or Satan, but few, really few were able to be original and bring to us a new dimension. This one did though and we should be glad it did.The ending of the film is very good, for it leaves questions open plus it leaves the possibility of a second instalment open too, so it is good for both the viewer and the makers. Believe me, I do not like every sequel (although I'm pretty sure they are making a sequel to this one), but I sure like an ending like this one, for it is quick, abrupt and does not answer all the questions. Plus I found the sarcastic song at the credits rather funny too.8 out of 10Note: this review has been amended to remove some sexist comments I included at the time. Apologies for any offence caused.

God awful film,"I was utterly prepared to really like this film. A big fan of James Wong from both the X-Files and Space:A&B, this film is a disaster. Disaster is perhaps the wrong word as it seems to play out exactly as the film makers intended it, which I suppose is a different thing than a disaster. I will save you one torture I had to endure throughout the film: there is no twist. If you've seen the trailer, you know exactly what happens in the film! No Sixth Sense, no Usual Suspects, heck, not even an April Fool's Day (check it out for a much better Dead Teenager movie). This was the big disappointment of the movie.This would not have necessarily doomed the movie if it had not been so dreadfully lacking in a sense of humour. In the post-Scream horror era, a dead teenager movie taking it seriously is bound to fail. This is not to say that every dt has to be a spoof now, but some tongue in cheek here and there would have greatly filled out the movie. Or perhaps to have lightened the sledgehammer with which the director drives home every single plot point in the movie...ugh.

Completely unexpected...I soiled my trousers 3 times over!!,"I came into FINAL DESTINATION not knowing what to expect and I have to say I left the theatre pleasantly surprised (actually, that's an understatement. The movie shocked me so unrelentingly that by the end I couldn't wait to get home and change my pants).  I am not usually one to enjoy teeny-bopper thrillers, and I have NEVER been one to clutch my bag of Bridge Mixture in horror in any sort of movie.  However, the throw-away, casual, tongue-in-cheek manner in which this movie depicted deaths was for incredibly shocking...and I can't believe I enjoyed it. That is not to say that FINAL DESTINATION was all pant-wetting fun.  The characters were thinly drawn and the second half of the movie reverts to a few too many teen-horror/thriller cliches.  My biggest quibble was with a character named Carter.  He ruined many scenes by being completely unbelievable in the way he behaved and talked.  Now, this complaint may seem silly in a movie so full of convoluted logic, but the massive leaps of faith that the plot required never bothered me.

"Interesting Concept, but bizzare and poorly done movie","This movie starts out very well with a high schooler having a vision of the plane he is about to take off on exploding, and his panic eventually leads to him and six others leaving the plane only to have it explode moments after take off.  Now the movie takes off into the bizzare as we find that you cannot cheat death, and apparently death will kill you only in bizzare ways.  The movie now becomes unitentionally laughable as death slowly stalks each victim before offing them.  You don't ever see death, you only get a hint right before you die.  Death even goes as far as to cover his tracks after each person dies, which makes you wonder why?  In general this could have been an interesting movie, but it bogs itself down with teen-slasher movie cliches and an uneven script that leaves gaping holes in the plot and makes everyone in the film seem utterly stupid.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Silly and unintentionally hilarious,"When this movie was screened at a movie marathon held in my school I laughed out loud, garnering me a few weird stares from my fellow schoolmates, who were actually pretty terrified by the nonsense that was going on on-screen. I laughed for that reason too, but more importantly, I found this movie extremely hilarious.Perhaps it is my sadistic sense of humour, I don't know, but it's funny how the producers of this stupid, brainless ""horror"" movie could think of such creative ways to kill off their irritating characters whom nobody really care about. A good example would be the death of the teacher, whatever her name is. That scene nearly killed me, pun fully intended, especially when she needed help to actually get herself totally killed.""Final Destination"" had a great premise. It just had an extremely lousy and predictable execution. What could've been a truly terrifying movie about the inevitability of death and the suffering one goes through living with that knowledge became a rehashed, one-dimensional joke of a movie that had elements of previously and equally bad slasher movies in it. Its greatest flaw was its cardboard cut-out characters. With the exception of Devon Sawa and Ali Larter, the cast looked like they were picked from unwanted extras who failed to make it to the latest teenage flick. The characters irritated the living bejesus out of me because they were whining so much that I just wanted them to get killed already and put me out of my agony of watching such stupidity. The jock was predictably cocky, his girlfriend predictably bitchy, and the rest of them? Don't even remember.The only good part about the movie is Devon Sawa and Ali Larter. Sawa is a good actor whose talent was wasted on playing a silly character, while Larter, whom I've never seen before prior to this, was surprisingly convincing as Clear Rivers (""Clear""? What kind of a name is CLEAR?!). She was pleasantly understated and provided a nice break from Alex's perpetual high-strungness, so to speak. The chemistry between them also helped to make the love angle that just HAD to be present a tad less sickening.Still, it was obvious that this movie existed for no reason other than to rake in the cash at the box office, which should explain the extreme gore factor. Somebody should tell the producers that sometimes, the thing that scares most is not what one can see, but what one cannot see. Our imagination is a powerful tool. They should learn to make use of it.",,Anonymous,Horror

A modern horror classic!,"I love this movie. The concept sounded very intriguing, so I decided to give it a watch.It starts off calm enough. However, it only takes mere minutes before you start to feel something is wrong. The signs changing by themselves to ""Final Destination"", GOD was that creepy! And it only gets worse. Alex Browning (the main character) knows something is wrong, he just can't put his finger on it yet. Soon, something horrible happens...! The plane falls apart and is about to explode! But this hasn't happened yet. It turns out it was Alex having a vision, so he then warns everyone what is going to happen. Only a few seem to understand that he's serious, but a few lives saved is better than no lives saved at all. Don't worry folks, this is NOT a spoiler. I thought so at first and went ""Jesus, give away the whole movie, why won't you?!"". But thankfully, I was wrong. Traumatized, but relieved, he comes out of the plane alive with a couple of people, seven or so. So everything is fine, right? Hell no! Shortly afterwards, one of the survivors die in the most bizarre way possible! (when you see it, you will be terrified at how cruel the death is, but also laugh at how inanely stupid it looks) And the killer is no one less than Death itself! Now this I found interesting. That it's not some slasher-type maniac but an entity you can't escape instead, is MUCH, MUCH scarier and chilling. Alex believes the death is not a coincidence and so, with the help of Clear Rivers, tries to figure out the mystery... Was the plane crash MEANT to happen? Is it possible to cheat Death?This is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. Afterwards, I found myself looking around, wondering if any object near me could kill me!Everything is excellent. The cinematography, the acting (Devon Sawa and Ali Larter were marvelous in their respective roles), the music and the overall direction (James Wong was a brilliant writer at The X Files, and seems to be doing just as well directing) couldn't have been better. It's also a movie where you have to pay attention, or you won't understand all the revelations in the plot. It's difficult not to spoil this movie, but let me just say that not only is it really spooky, it actually has its bit of dark comedy as well. And rarely have there been as many moments in a horror movie for me where I've been frightened and in hysterics at the same time. And it even has a great ending. A satisfying ending for a horror movie is always a pickle, since it in some cases can be too ludicrous or cheesy. But here it was simply perfect. The characters also all have their interesting personalities. I'm pleasantly surprised over how I actually cared about almost everybody, even that dumb jerk Carter. Well okay, Valerie Newton was an unbearable selfish bastard. That's one exception right there. By the way, there's also... Bludworth. I have no idea who on earth he is supposed to be or what the hell is wrong with him... but he unsettles me. His voice got under your skin and he almost sounded like something evil was lurking under the surface. It's disappointing that he appeared so little, but at least he's in the sequel too. Maybe he has a larger role there. Tony Todd was like a natural in that part.Now, there is one strange detail... It's never explained or even hinted at, why Alex has these visions. How can he foresee deaths? Where did this gift come from? But this is a really small complaint. There was so much about the movie to adore and be inspired by that I could look past that and just find myself entertained.Listen up, you talentless modern day horror directors: THIS is how you make a scary piece of work!One last thing to you who read this: In death there are no accidents, no coincidences, no mishaps and no escapes.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Final Destination uses its precognitive abilities to spawn a franchise devoid of suspense.,"Yes, another influential horror series that is ferociously mediocre and stupid beyond belief. The franchise filled with inventive death sequences, narrow survivability and teeny weeny clich√©s all started here with Wong, a man clearly hellbent in forcing audiences to be mildly cautious of everything, everyone and everywhere. Except he forgot one crucial aspect. He had seemingly directed/written a horror, but where's the suspense? Where's the horror? And holy flailing live wire where's the characterisation? A teenager cheats death after experiencing a premonition of a plane (which clearly wasn't suitable for take off...) exploding. He and a multitude of students leave the plane before the catastrophic event takes place and now Death is curing his boredom by finding inventive ways to kill these fools.For instance, a teenager strangling themselves with a shower and unable to stand up. Or a girl being slammed by the most silent speeding bus. Maybe a monitor exploding like a bomb and dispersing shards of glass into a woman's neck. No wait, I got it! Decapitation by shrapnel! Anyway, despite how inventive and gloriously gory these death sequences were, whilst suspending your disbelief for the vast majority of the film's runtime, masquerading plot conveniences as determinism is incredibly lazy writing. Hang on! I know exactly what you're thinking. ""Uhhh the point of these films is that Death is controlling their outcomes"". And I get it. I'm fine with that. But you're going to try and convince me that all the survivors happened to be at the same caf√© as one of them meets their early demise, to which was all part of Death's plan? Or Billy riding his bicycle at the exact moment a house explodes? No. Those are just conveniences that outline the amateurish writing capabilities of the screenplay writers.Speaking of screenplay, nearly every line of dialogue is used to theorise about Death's plan. These students aren't having natural conversations about their lives or what they had for breakfast. They discuss death in so much detail, that one could mistake them for being morticians. Cheer up guys, please! The lack of characterisation is woeful, and in turn makes us care less about who meets their demise or not. Honestly, didn't give a toss who got impaled by a washing line. Wong had his mind purely set on ""how"" they were going to die, as opposed to ""who"", and in turn deviated from the much required suspense that Final Destination craved.Fortunately the practical effects make up for the absent tension, particularly the introductory plane catastrophe, inducing plenty of gore being splattered on the screen. The acting was functional for a teen horror, although Sawa and Larter were standouts with their underdeveloped pairing, and the Goldberg effect on some of the deaths were fascinating to watch unravel. But then you see Death retreat the water that mysteriously followed Tod on the bathroom floor, and we're back to nonsensical stupidity.Final Destination is a film I appreciate, especially for its influence and staying power in the horror genre. Forever watchable and a great film to put on during a popcorn night. However it's irrefutably mediocre, with stupidity around every corner and morticians randomly delivering excessive exposition, so much so that Death has seemingly possessed everyone into thinking it's actually decent.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Like watching a very graphic Road Runner/Wile E. Coyote cartoon,"After a heart-stopping beginning, ""Final Destination"" is a thrillerbogs down in the middle and end. Devon Sawa stars as Alex, a highschool student whose friends start dying mysteriously after theyall escape impending death from an exploding Cessna. The spectacular plane explosion was enough to garner some attention, but following that, all it took for the movie to go on were cornball stunts and deathscenes. (TEASER alert) One particular death was when one girl met her demise by stupidly going backwards on a street and to get hit by aspeeding bus. Can someone please tell me what was that all about??",,Anonymous,Horror
Terrifying,"This movie has to be on the top of the horror genre list.  It had a great script and very original concept.  Nobody just dies in the movie, they really really die.  The death scenes were very elaborate and terrifying.

Didn't stand the test of time,"Pretty dumb horror flick. Lacks character development or any masterful storytelling. If you're a 15-year-old, the idea of a ""design of death"" that plays out according to a pattern and where the protagonists have to outdo the pattern might be fascinating, but beyond that, even for the sake of simple entertainment, it's just dumb.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
death is coming,"I don't want to sit down here and type out the premise of the movie, because it's been done already.  What I would like to mention is that people seem to overlook this one: Morgan & Wong, yes, worked on The X-Files, but they also wrote and directed many episodes of Chris Carter's Millennium - a TV series that ran three seasons on Fox, which in my opinion was much better and scarier than The X-Files. In fact it was the best of Television ever, nothing comes close.If you liked Final Destination, definitely check out Millennium (running in syndication on the FX channel).  Episodes: ""The Fourth Horseman"" and ""The Time is Now"" are very much in the vein of FD.  Because of the gore and intensity they brought to the show, I thought for sure it was going to be thrown off the air immediately.  Luckily it lasted for a bit longer.Morgan and Wong don't pull any punches.My only criticism is their inaccurate depiction of the Hare Krishna devotee in the airport.  They're actually good people, but are depicted as brain dead psychos.  And Morgan and Wong do this every opportunity they get when they have a story in the airport.  Ha.  Oh well . . .",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
interesting,"this is a good definition. interesting. and it is not only a word. are many horrors using teenagers as killers/preys . in many cases - only a kind of screams factories. this film is special for the desire to give a form of profound story. and, for this cause, to be, in few scenes, credible. Dominic Sawwa gives a good role and he has force and precision to support the film. and the terror, artificial in too many moments, gives a honest help to story. it is not extraordinary but it is good. as horror and as story about teenagers fears. and this is important. the great sin - existence of next parts. but temptation of producers is understandable.",,Anonymous,Horror
A 2000 destined hit,"From the opening reel, as the haunting ominous music score plays, a evil and ugliness presents itself. As stopping at the dreaded number three of this series, (number two was a pretty good sequel) of course this one being the best, I liked the whole cool scenario, indeed something different. If I watched FD, again, (I haven't seen it was for years), it would pretty much have about the same impact of eerieness and foreboding, as first time around. On a class holiday to France, Devon Sawa (what happened to him) has a premonition the plane he boards, him and his mates board will burst into smithereens seconds after take off. Him and a score of students get off the plane. The others stay on it. The plane takes off again. Boom! It's just like Sawa envisioned. Then death starts hunting Sawa and his mates down, one by one, in a series of freak accidents. So becoming the hero here, Sawa must find a way to curb and beat this evil, before the handful become fewer. This is a cool 2000 movie, something completely different of that year. What's terrifying about Final Destination, is the story concept, as of the surviving kids, where death is inevitable, their fates decided. You're thinking, ""How could these survivors die, being so lucky?"". But, that was the killer element I loved. Some of them die in some pretty gruesome ways too, though this doesn't compare to No 2, I should warn you. It's frightening to imagine, living in a world where this story would be true. A comparison as to inevitability and fate, is like in the Hostel movies, where some lucky victims escape, but they're all not lucky for long, as the Elite hunts em' down. Their fates inevitable. Same frightening point here. Just check out it's last shock shot. FD boasts good performances from some up and coming stars, but as to lead, Sawa's diminishing future in thespian world, I can't help but feel sad if a little bugged. Chilling haunting psycho supernatural thriller/horror, all the way.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
How did this thing spawn an entire movie franchise?,"This is a really bad pseudo-horror film that would almost fit better into the disaster movie genre. A high school senior, Alex Browning (Devon Sawa), has a violent premonition while sitting on a plane waiting for departure for his senior class trip to Paris. He causes a commotion that gets him, several students and a teacher to be kicked off the plane. After leaving and while watching the departure, there's a disastrous mechanical failure and the plane explodes killing all aboard. The passengers who were kicked off are interviewed by the FBI, who're particularly interested in Alex because of his foreknowledge of the event and is treated as a suspect. And after all that the film goes into overdrive with this vague specter going around causing accidents that kill the survivors in grotesque (and unintentionally funny) ways. Alex learns from a creepy mortician named William Bludsworth (Tony Todd in his best Candyman face and voice) that he somehow cheated Death's design and its correcting this by doing away with the people who walked away from the plane disaster. Alex becomes determined to stop it.Give the writer some credit for a semi-original idea in having Death itself kill a bunch of stupid teens rather than a masked psycho with butcher's tools but the execution is pure B-movie slasher and the acting is as bad as a high school play especially from Devon Sawa. The movie is gratuitous crap but somehow made enough money and is cult classic enough to have FIVE SEQUELS!",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Frustrating at times, but definitely not boring!!!","Better than the average slasher film because the ""slasher"" was the grim reaper, an unknown and almost unstoppable entity, much harder to deal with, there just wasn't anywhere to escape, and nothing you could do to ""cheat death"".

You Don't Cheat The Grim Reaper,"Final Destination which spawned a veritable cottage industry of sequels like Rocky had a certain popularity among the young who really seem to have a terribly negative view of life. When young Devon Sawa has a creepy premonition and gets himself thrown off a plane bound for Paris in a class trip, a few others of his classmates and one teacher get thrown off with him.They all see in real life exactly what Sawa saw in his vision and they count themselves horrified at seeing friends and classmates die in a spectacular way as the plane exploded. They count themselves lucky at first, but then some mysterious force best articulated by Tony Todd says that Death is a character like any other and it's got a mean disposition. There is a plan of leaving this mortal coil in a specific order and you dare not disrupt the order.After which the rest start dropping in a series of bizarre situations and this has been the secret of the success of Final Destination and its sequels.

"Great Fun, pity about the ending","Again we are thrust into another horror about unlucky teenagers facing certain death, but this time around its great fun. Is it better than Scream? To tell the truth I'm not sure, but Final Destination boasts a cast of extreme talent from movie virgin Devon Sawa, Dawson's Creek's unsure homosexual Kerr Smith, House On Haunted Hill's Ali Larter, American Pie's bully Sean William Scott to horror legend Tony Todd (Last seen impaled in The Rock).The story is original. A class of students are on their way to France when one student Alex Browning (Sawa) has a vision of the plane exploding. Him and six others are removed from the plane and sure enough the plane explodes. Each of them now has to fight for his or her life as death visits them one by one.The plot is twisty and if it wasn't for a rushed ending, Final Destination would be a killer.

The main premise is that there is a force of evil knocking off those who survived, which although not a novel idea was well brought across.This film was occasionally frightening, and kept going right till the end - which is more than you can say for a lot of the Hollywood pap of recent times.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Nice try, but a horribly executed premise","Death itself being the serial killer that is stalking and killing a bunch of kids who dodged their appointed time to die, is an interesting concept. At least it was a new spin on a horror film of this type after the glut of Scream knock-offs that had been littering theaters throughout the late 90s. However, the idea is not realized in an effective fashion with Final Destination. Considering the number of ways we all could die any given day of the week, it becomes downright comical watching the Rube-Goldberg methods that death implements to take down these kids. The movie seems to think we're supposed to be tense and frightened when a splash of water is making its way across the floor in order to make someone slip and fall, but I could only chuckle. In fact, there's one death that is so elaborate that I felt like it was pulled from a Naked Gun movie.There were definitely other times when the film went so over-the-top that it felt like they were going for comedy. The most blatant is the ridiculous scene in the morgue where Tony Todd explains the premise of the film for us in case we didn't understand yet. Maybe the tone would have worked better if they hired at least one good actor. However, Final Destination is overflowing with young people straight out of Central Casting. Not one of them effectively conveys an emotion, with the possible exception of Ali Larter who might be trying a little bit. Devon Sawa, who plays the lead character, is arguably the worst of the bunch. There's nothing likable or endearing about his performance, to the point that I was kind of rooting for him to die earlier. I can applaud the attempt these film-makers made to think outside the box, but the end result of Final Destination is not good.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Fun, Fun, and more fun!","What is a better way to make a horror film than to constantly make people die in freak accidents by 'death' himself? Well in schlock horror cinema, not much. The film isn't a masterpiece, but for what it is, it is pretty darn great. It also helps that it builds tension nicely, not to mention how eerie and horrifying the plane crash scene is. I remember it giving me nightmares when I was a kid. This was my fav horrors as a kid but it still holds up pretty nicely and it was the time I was introduced to Ali Larter. Definitely a worthwhile film that actually builds up more and more as the franchise goes on. Strongly recommend this film and it is definitely better than the other popular horror franchise Saw (and even as the originals go this is better).",,Anonymous,Horror

Immediately he goes crazy telling everyone the plane is going to explode. eventually 6 students and alex leave the plane and after a moments the plane takes off it explodes. This is where the story gets interesting by getting off the plane Alex soon realizes that him and his friends have cheated Death and they have to figure out when death is coming back at them.The concept of this movie looks stupid but who cares when there is tight gripping screenplay with lot of thrills to enjoy.

Why so complicated? Did Death suddenly become bored with the usual ways teens die and decided to invent shocking ways to off adolescents? It's like the countdown clocks movies put on bombs: who's the audience for these things? Death wanted the kids blown to bits, about the quickest death possible. Why then elaborate deaths for the survivors. Why not an aneurysm? Kids die either way but one gets Death his trophies faster.

Decent but not solid,"This is a great idea but the part I don't like is at the morgue when examining Todd's body. The coroner explains that lacerations on his hands are from yanking at the wire that strangled him. Alex brings up a great point that he if he was yanking at the wire, he wasn't trying to kill himself--it was an accident. All that develops into is the coroner coming back with a weird remark that in death, there ARE no accidents or coincidences. Realistically, someone wouldn't have that reaction to a great point and I thought, ""Ok, could we quit being weird and acknowledge the point he just made? He was tugging at the wire, which means he didn't exactly set this situation up for himself. So how did this happen? It's bizarre. How can his death be explained?""

(5/10) Excellent concept let down by poor execution,"Every once in a while a film gets made that is really bad ¬ñ but that is, for some reason, enjoyable at the same time.  Final Destination falls into this category, as a film that works with an excellent concept, the potential of which is, sadly, unfulfilled.The film is standard teen horror fare with a twist ¬ñ the villain is no psycho waiting round the bend, but Death itself and the group of seven must try to find ways to cheat this supernatural power in order to stay alive. The key to solving the mystery is Alex (Devon Sawa) ¬ñ who has the visions that allow him to save his friends, or ultimately condemn them to the life hereafter.The fault of this film lies with the sloppy writing and the indifferent direction of the piece.  The dialogue is self-indulgent and immature and the level of characterization is poor, with no attempts at development or even a full depiction of the static characters which are presented here.  The vision which lies at the heart of the story remains there ¬ñ it does not surface for the viewer to see; we do not actually care about the characters whose lives we touch by watching the film.Of course, even the most skilled actors would struggle to perform such poorly written roles as the ones encountered in this screenplay.  Devon Sawa, who has lost his boyhood looks, does not have the presence to carry this film ¬ñ or probably any other film ¬ñ to success.  Ali Larter probably fares the best as the outcast Clear,  - the most credibly written character in the piece.  Kerr Smith is wasted in his role as Carter; this is nothing more than an attempt to move away from his television persona in Dawson's Creek.Where this film does succeed, however, is in the elaborate death scenes which punctuate the narrative, creating an horrific and paranoiac tone which is easily taken home with the audience.  The handling of these scenes succeeds in creating large amounts of tension, and the outcome is disturbingly cathartic for those who witness them.Final Destination could have been a great film ¬ñ there are parts which spring to life, but as a whole the piece remains a mediocre study of the way in which we view death ¬ñ and life.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's called final destination,"I feel very nostalgic for my pre-9/11 travel whenever I watch ""Final Destination."" Yes, that's a funny thing to say given how many violent deaths there are in this film but there's a breeziness to the travel scenes that remind me of how light hearted travel used to be before 9/11. When Alex's passport flips open, I recognize it as the pre-9/11 passport with the small printing and photo (after 9/11 passports changed and the design began to look ugly).The early scenes are the best - including the opening titles with a creepy humming fan that's supposed to remind you of a jet's propellers. Once the premonition is set and comes true, everything seems to go downhill a bit - the whole logic behind who gets to live and die didn't quite make sense. But the opening sequence is fantastic and I can re-watch it over and over.I took three trips to Paris just before 9/11 and this film brings back the days when the young didn't spend all their time staring at a stupid phone. You notice everybody in the early scenes is reading a travel book, as that was the main thing you brought with you on a trip (along with a digital camera or a manual camera with film). Everybody back then had good posture and stared at each other. You don't see that nowadays - instead everybody's eye is on Instagram or Tik Tok or some other stupid video. I wish cell phones had never been invented.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's not big & it's not clever,"¬ëFinal Destination' was disappointing. I expected a clever, intelligent splatterfest along the lines of ¬ëScream' but this is a poor imitation. The initial idea is good ¬ñ a bunch of students cheating death by plane crash by receiving a premonition, then death catching up with them, but it fails to live up to it's promise.This film tries hard to be SOMETHING ¬ñ but whatever it is it just doesn't happen. For instance, one of the students is in the bathroom; spooky music starts up; he's sitting on the loo (ouch); a tap underneath comes loose by itself & water drips out; he gets up from the loo (phew); he sees a shadow in the mirror; he picks up a razor & cuts himself on the neck; the water moves purposefully towards his bare feet; NO, he's put down the razor & walks away just before the water touches his feet; he plugs in a radio (water, electricity ¬ñ ouch); again he moves just before the water reaches him; etc., etc. Is this supposed to be funny, knowingly clever, scary, all three? I don't know, but for me it was just dull.This sort of voyeuristically sadistic ¬ëwho's going to get it next & how' game, although basically in very bad taste, can be very funny: for instance in ¬ëScream'. The difference is that ¬ëScream' is clever enough to make it obvious that the characters being bumped off in increasingly messy ways were parodies of themselves & not meant to be taken seriously; here however it seems we're supposed to believe that they are real. In expecting us to take sadistic delight in guessing who gets it next & in what particularly grisly manner I think makes a movie like this just plain nasty, & childishly so.At the risk of getting a touch of the Mary Whitehouses (God forbid) I think it is exactly this sort of movie which contributes to making society, (particularly American society & with it the rest of the Western world), numb to pain, suffering & violence in a way that immunises us from the real thing: so that the war in the Gulf, the Kosovan crisis, become just another TV show -  & we forget that there are real people out there suffering & dying horribly, or maybe we just don't care.OK ¬ñ end of sermon! I said we're supposed to believe the characters are real ¬ñ ¬ësupposed' because they are badly realised, & mostly caricatures: either shallow & nasty, stupid or plain dull. It's possible we're meant to think that they are in fact parodies of themselves but if this is the case it's so badly done it just doesn't come across at all. In fact I doubt if that much thought has gone into it. There are a few genuine shocks & funny moments, mostly based around sudden & unexpected deaths, (although in hindsight I think I found it funny because I wanted it to be so), but overall this left me flat. After the 1st sticky death I lost interest, I didn't give a ¬ëmonkeys' about the characters, the story was thin & the direction mediocre. The best part of the whole thing was a brief cameo by Tony ¬ëCandyman' Todd as a creepy mortician.This is doubly disappointing for me as director James Wong along with co-writer Glen Morgan were responsible for some of the very best of the early ¬ëX-Files' as well as ¬ëSpace: Above & Beyond' & are capable of much better than this.My verdict: best avoided ¬ñ unless you're a schoolkid, which I suspect is the target audience: 'it's not big, & it's not clever'.RATING: 3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Your destination for fun...,"What if Death had a plan for you, but by matter of intervention that plan was cut short? What if you and a handful of other people were selected to die on a certain date, only you didn't. What would happen? In short, the question is this: Is Death egocentric? Because if Death's plan was altered, well, he could just shrug like most of us when our plans go awry and turn away. But in ""Final Destination,"" a film about a band of teenagers who never board a plane destined to explode in flight, it appears as though Death has a very large ego--one that doesn't like to be messed with. Why else would he chase the survivors down and try to kill them in a ritualistic pattern?It's about time a clever premise intertwined with the teenage-horror genre. After years of being subjected to such ""quality"" material lining up the shelves at your local video store under the Horror Section, which might as well be named Horror for Teens, now you can stop worrying, because James Wong's ""Final Destination"" is not only smart, but tons of fun.Alex (Devon Sawa), a seventeen-year-old highschooler, is going on a funded trip to Paris, France, with a horde of other teens. His flight, 180, is about to take off with him in it when he intercepts a startling vision. In it, the plane starts to take off and suddenly malfunctions, exploding in a haze of fire.Alex's dream starts to follow course. Scared, he panics and exits the plane before take-off, along with a few other misled youths and a schoolteacher. They wait behind and agree to catch the next flight to Paris, when their original source of travel explodes in the sky, just as predicted by Alex.Alex is shunned by many as a freak in the weeks to come. His best friend (who nearly boarded the plane along with Alex) commits suicide out of anger, frustration and sadness. But Alex realizes that perhaps he did not commit suicide after all--maybe it was Death coming back to follow through with his plan. Soon more die, and Alex comes up with a diagram of the plane's structure, and labels where everyone was sitting. He sees a pattern: The deaths are in sync with the position of where the victims would have been on the plane if it had taken off with them in it. So Alex tries to cheat Death again by fighting back--he comes close to fatality along with his other grave-destined friends (Seann William Scott, Ali Larter), but manages to stay alive by the hairs on his chin. (Well, actually, he doesn't have any hairs on his chin. But that's irrelevant, right?)""Final Destination"" has been done before in other ways, but this is one of the more memorable examples of the idea. It's a very smart teenage horror flick when you look at it in light of all the other profit-making Hollywood dreck. The beginning is beyond intriguing--the entire plane sequence and vision is handled with such great direction and timing by James Wong, it's easy to imagine how it could have been made by a lesser director without nearly the same gut-wrenching effect.Wong, who co-wrote the script, uses some great camera techniques that help salvage this film. The acting isn't too bad either--Sean William Scott, who played Stifler in ""American Pie"" (1999), is especially funny in his role, much to the contrary with 2003's ""Bulletproof Monk."" Devon Sawa started his career with ""Night of the Twisters"" and hasn't been in too many memorable films since, including ""Wild America"" and ""Slackers,"" but this ranks as one of his better movies and roles.""Final Destination"" is especially good in its first fifteen minutes, but after the plane segment, however, the film slowly but surely falls in a downward spiral. It becomes tiresome and even quite ridiculous as it draws to a close. However, the first half of ""Final Destination"" is your destination for fun.4/5 stars.John Ulmer",,Anonymous,Horror
Surprisingly Good!,"I was very surprised when I saw this movie.  I thought it would be awful, but it was one of the best teen slashers that has been released since ""Scream"" brought back the genre.  The only other teen horror that I liked after the boom was ""The Faculty"", but now there's ""Final Destination"".  I thought the acting was good and the whole premise was very intriguing. Although it's not great, I have a soft spot for these kind of movies and it kept me interested the whole time.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Teen slasher film without the slasher, see it on cable.","The premise of the new James Wong film, Final Destination, is that Alex Browning, the protagonist, prevents six of his friends from boarding a doomed airplane, thereby cheating fate. However, fate is not so easily bested, and Alex's friends soon begin dying in unusual circumstances. Essentially, this premise is a clever-way to make a slasher-flick without the slasher.   Unfortunately, this is practically the only clever thing about the film. As far as teen horror flicks go, Final Destination is better than many.  There is enough shocking death, graphic gore, and requisite black humor to provide the essential ""roller coaster"" type thrill at the heart of the average horror flick.  Unfortunately, this film also suffers from the worst characteristics of this genre. The relationships between the main characters are tenuous and their motivations are meaningless except as excuse to set-up the next death. The scene where two of the characters break into a funeral home to view the body of their recently killed friend is suppose to be scary and dramatic but features some of the dumbest dialogue I have witnessed.  If you are looking for a Saturday night thriller to scare your date, this film might do the trick. Other than that, wait until it goes into heavy-rotation on cable.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
An intriguing teen horror-thriller,"James Wong, director of the hit television series ""X-Files"", steps inside the teen-horror genre with this intriguing disaster-thriller. Alex Browning (played by Devon Sawa), a high school senior is on his way on a week-long field trip with his French class to Paris. Shortly upon boarding the plane, Alex has a horrifying vision of the plane exploding. Plagued with paranoia, Alex panics and rushes off the plane, with seven others removed off board. Much to everyone's shock, Alex's nightmare comes true when the plane unexpectedly explodes upon takeoff, killing everyone on board. The survivors off board include Alex's best friend Todd (Chad E. Donella), his arch-rival Carter (Kerr Smith), Carter's girlfriend Terri (Amanda Detmer), orphaned girl Clear (Ali Larter), tag-along student Billy (Seann William Scott), and their teacher Mrs. Lewton (Kristen Cloke). While many become grief- stricken by their losses, Alex discovers that death is still after them when the survivors who originally escaped their demise begin dying in freak accidents.Final Destination was definitely one of the most original horror films Hollywood has it offer. This isn't a typical horror movie. Instead of a blade-wielding killer in a mask, girls possessed by evil spirits, or people being attacked by monstrous creatures; this film deals with the killer being death itself. The concept involves teenagers who escape a deadly plane explosion and begin dying in really unusual accidents. Basically, these characters get killed from doing average, everyday stuff like cooking or hanging clothes. Yes, this may sound somewhat laughable, but this film does a good job making this suspenseful and intense. The plane crash sequence was pretty intense for me, it almost had me scared of going another plane ride. The death scenes were also pretty intense, although I think they could have been done better.I really love the characters in this movie. Each one of the characters are very well developed and have their own personality. Alex, the main character was easily my favorite, along with Ali Larter's character Clear, the girl who stands by Alex's side after the plane disaster; unlike the other characters who blame Alex for the deaths of the people on the plane. The cast did an alright job as their characters, none of them really stand out from others.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Silly - but with Style!,"The strength of FINAL DESTINATION lies in its ability to keep audiences on (to use a cliche) the edge of their seats. Or rather, to convince audiences that something is about to happen, then do a complete turn-around and have something else inexplicably happen.WHAT AM I TALKING ABOUT?Well, for example the death scenes. A large build-up ensues, where the movie convinces the audience that a character is going to die in all sorts of horrible ways. Then an anticlimatical drop occurs. The audience sighs, the character will be ok they think. But then - WHAM! - the character is killed in a most unexpected way. This is the power of this movie. Otherwise, the acting isn't very good; the script unsurprising; and the direction often slack, surprisingly so for John Woo.As for the core of the movie, the characters are hastily sketched with no depth and the storyline is rather old-hat fare. There is no denying it, this is a very silly film - but it will have you hooked till the end.Also of note: FINAL DESTINATION is a slasher movie, and the first without an actual killer - death itself stalks the protaganists instead. Interesting too is the way the movie turns everyday objects and occurrences into lethal weapons, and sometimes in rather original ways. There are also some neat in-jokes throughout.Bottom-line: Silly but with style and an ability to grip even the most reluctant viewer.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Simpson in the opening scene of ""Naked Gun"".  Fabulous!!

Surprisingly scary,"This movie was not what I expected from the comments of critics.  The movie kept me wondering and waiting for the next kill or scare.  Even though you knew when someone was going to die, or when some scary seen was coming up, I still jumped out of my seat. Alex(Devon Sawa) sees the his plane to Paris explode, and that is when it all started for him and his other friends.  They are being killed off one by one, and only Alex understands why this is happening.  They run from death, but no one can escape their own destiny.  I am not going to ruin the ending for anyone, so I won't say anymore about the plot. I think this movie should be seen in the theater just for the kicks of being scared and it is good enough to spend $7.50 to see it.  Although most critics would disagree with me on this, I will still believe that the acting was superb,(especially Devon Sawa) the plot was interesting, and the movie was very scary.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Badly Executed,"I did not know there were sequels to this dire tragedy of a movie until I searched for it and they came up on auto complete.The fact that sequels to this exist and sold further reduces my faith in human kind and reinforces my own belief that I am not part of this race and am proud to say that.The premise of this movie was good! It had a philosophical point, you can't cheat death... but it was so badly executed I couldn't bare to watch it to the end.In short, the premise was good, the plot was good, the actors acted the parts they had been given with skill. The direction, the photography were all top notch... but whoever wrote this script should be subjected to some kind of non fatal but painful and permanently disfiguring acid-genital torture.Recently I watched ""Cast Away"" with Tom Hanks, now its not the best movie I've ever seen but it made some points without having to say them and in its own simple way moved me.""Final destination"" however seems to either, aim at an audience that cannot be moved and need everything explaining to them (perhaps the dead, stroke victims, or the population of Norfolk), or, more likely, was written by an heartless UN-imaginative meeting of corporate types.The premise and plot of this movie could have made a wonderful experience if not executed (and I mean that in both ways, conducted by and killed by) utter sh!t heads.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"INTENSE, and genuinely scary","intense is a word that some people may not be able to associate with the current trend of teen slasher flicks.  Many of the current brood of cinematic horror depends to much on humor and excessive gore and skimp on the story, shocks, and plot twists.  I am quite proud to say that FINAL DESTINATION does NOT fall into these holes...at least not too much. Everything about this movie is intense and well paced.  It also does something that few other horror movies do well and that is play with the audience's expectations, in a few death scenes the crowd braces itself for the oncoming death only to have it yanked away for a little longer, then have it taken away again until finally delivering the goods, and deliver it does.  the deaths, while not wholly original, are very well done and, in some cases ABSOLUTELY, JAW-DROPPINGLY SHOCKING.  Most importantly, the death scenes aren't particularly gory but they start off believable and realistic and get less believable as the film goes on, i took this to be an example of just how far Death will go to keep his/her plan.  Finally i was very impressed with the ending, it's not set in stone but it still leaves you wondering if everything is over.  All in all a very good movie...even better when you consider the CRAP that has passed for horror as of late.",,Anonymous,Horror
"He's at the 40, at the 30.....FUMBLE!","Did you ever walk out of a movie feeling cheated?  I did last night.Agreed, some films do this intentionally (Patriot Games, Basic Instinct, Evil Dead) but some suffer from the problem of having a great beginning, a fairly solid middle and a seriously disappointing ending.Such is the case with Final Destination.  A French student's clairvoyant dream saves 6 other would-be pieces of fried chicken from a plane explosion that they witness from the terminal.  Thirty-nine days after the thirty-nine schoolchums die (including the professor that not too many seem broken up about), Death wants a little payback...in spades.  Our hero and his doomed friends try to figure out Death's ""design"" (killing each off in the order they would have died) and try to save each other from their fates while avoiding the FBI who want answers.Okay, decent semi-Hitchcockian (note one of the characters named Hitchcock) opening and a decent plotline, What went wrong, right?A few things, actually.  Firstly, there was no real love relationship at all.  This was an extremely subtle part hinted at but more or less was tacked on at the end.Secondly, there is the ending itself.  How terrible was this?  It felt as if the testing audiences didn't like the original ending so some new situation was written and alternate footage shot at the last minute. Even so, did they think this ridiculousness gave closure? Not to spoil the ending but ask yourself this question, would you fly on a plane six months after you've had the forementioned ordeal?Do yourself a favor.  Leave this film 20 minutes before it ends and imagine your own version of an ending.  I'll bet you my $8 movie ticket that your idea far excelled the way it actually concludes.

"Reminiscent of early Hooper, Craven and Carpenter","Horror has to be one of the hardest genres to master.  People think horror is simple because many of the horror films that they think of are films from the 80's that seem to have low production costs and a non existent cast. But look again at some of the good horror from the last 40 years and you will see that fine tuning the craft of horror is just as difficult as any other and that when you have a good horror film, they are some of the best films ever made.  Personally, I place Jaws and Halloween on my top ten list of best FILMS ever made.  Even look at films like SIXTH SENSE, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, SCREAM, TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, EVIL DEAD and Hitchcock's PSYCHO and you will see not just good horror films, but good films.  You can add FINAL DESTINATION to that list of films.  There is enough chills and scenes of true terror to make you jump and to satisfy any serious horror buffs craving an increase in pulse.To start off, the film has what has to be some of the best (and scariest ) fifteen minutes to open a film.  It involves a dream sequence that tells Devon Sawa that something terrible is going to happen.  He dreams of an airplane crash.  But not only does he dream of the crash itself, he dreams of details.  The camera manipulates us into feeling what he feels as it circles frantically around his room and then it gives us the details of impending doom which is imminently lurking in the shadows.  Then in real time, he tries to tell everyone that the plane is going to crash and he gets kicked off the flight just before it takes off.  And then, in one of the best scenes in horror film history, we watch as the plane, visible from the window, blows up.You know a film has achieved it's perogative in scaring you when you have seen that particular scene in the trailers and it still scares you.  That is powerful film making and James Wong should be commended for his awesome vision.  Wong worked on some small movies like TRICK OR TREAT in the 80's and he is an X-FILES veteran.  But here he shows us that he has the same vision that made some of the greats from the past so stylistic.  I know I am heaping a load of praise on the film and the director when I mention names like TEXAS, HALLOWEEN, and NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, but it is well deserved praise.Final Destination doesn't have a true killer, not a tangible one anyway. There is no man with a hockey mask, or a dream figure with long finger knives that attack the kids in this film.  But what we get are subtle shots of unstoppable signs of death.  Winds gust up, shadows envelop the walls, the camera plays with us to make us think or in some cases lets us know that death is imminent.  An unforeseen deity? spirit? demon? is approaching and there is nothing that anyone can do to stop it.The casting is quite interesting as well.  Devon Sawa plays the main character and he is a wise choice even after his disasterous IDLE HANDS, but it is the supporting cast that is best part of the casting director.Kerr Smith sheds his sensitive gay persona from DAWSON'S CREEK and here plays a tough guy/jerk.  And he plays it quite well.  Stifler, from AMERICAN PIE, suffers the worst death in the film and although he is good, he is basically just another character.  I would have liked to see him play more of a role, the producers of Road Trip got it right when they basically gave him the same role as the one he played in American Pie.  But I guess this is a horror movie and that is of little consequence to the film.  Ali Larter from VARSITY BLUES fame ( and a stint on Dawson's Creek ) is the one that shines here the most.  Another reviewer in here noted that she was one of the best young actresses of her generation and although that is lofty praise, I have to concur.  She carries the film when Sawa is absent and I expect to see great things from her in the future.Final Destination is one of the scarier films to come out in the last 40 years.  And yes I am serious.  This is one that is definitely worth checking out.  And for any of you horror buffs out there that haven't seen it ( and this is especially for you M.A. Rogers from New York, who is as big a horror movie buff as I am and I enjoy your reviews in the IMDb immensely ) really should get the time to see this.  It is well worth your time.9 out of 10",,Anonymous,Horror
A refreshingly original horror movie.,"In the '90's the Scream trilogy meant the revival of the horror genre and teen-horror in particular. After that lots of horror movie were created that all were very much alike and of average (at best) quality. ""Final Destination"" however is one fine exception and it distinct itself from other genre movies through its originality. I consider ""Final Destination"" to be one of the most refreshing and original horror movies of this decade.It's not a horror movie with monsters or scary serial killers. It's a movie with an invisible villain; death itself, which is determined to kill everyone that escaped his clutches. It's a great and original concept that is executed even better as expected. The fact that the 'villain' is invisible provides the movie with some moments that makes this movie distinct itself from any other movie out of the same genre.Reason why this movie was even better than I anticipated were the deaths in this movie. Every death in the movie is highly complex and wonderfully constructed and executed. You know something bad is going to happen but you never know how and when. Therefor the deaths and way of death all still come as a surprise. It makes the movie very tense and also both scary and gory to watch at times.The movie starts of with a spectacular (but still obviously 'low' budget) plane crash. Fortunately after its beginning the movie doesn't loose any of its pace and the movie mostly remains spectacular to watch throughout its running time, which is only 98 minutes short.All of the actors are obvious B-movie material, which is fine and works out really well for a genre movie like this one. Don't get me wrong, the acting is not bad but none of the actors will win any big award, or star in a blockbuster any time soon. Fine exception, I must admit, perhaps was Seann William Scott who plays a fun role and perhaps shows his very best acting skills yet, in this movie.The movie has some awkward moments and some weak dialog and character treatment at times but thankfully it doesn't really make the movie any less entertaining or good to watch.An highly recommendable, refreshingly original horror flick that surpasses almost every other horror movie of this decade, so far.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Just excellent,"This is not just a teen film with a thin story line, then some silly jokes and then some sex...no, this film is way better. The very beginning makes the film a blood chilling masterpiece - when a main hero sees a vision of the plane crash and is in panic, he and several other people are gotten off the plane and then the plane explodes right when taking off, and then the true horror begins. Death is seeking all those who survive, it hunts its preys and kills them with no mercy. The absolute masterpiece of the film is the scene of the teacher's death - when she is going to drink hot tea and then adds some icy vodka instead and thus the cup is cracked, she then puts the cup on her computer, vodka oozes in, the PC explodes, the glass wounds her face, she falls down and then more and more terrible details add to her terrible death. The only weak point is the idea that death chooses the order who and when to kill. We all will die, but in no specific order, I believe, and there is no design here...",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Interesting concept, but instead relied on body count","I thought the film had an interesting idea. The construct of cheating death is very interesting me and to many. But this film instead relied on violence, body count and cheap thrills to make its point. I would've preferred if this were a dramatic mystery thriller in the likes of Jacob's Ladder (1990). But hey, at that time, slashers were fashionable. So I don't really blame the writers.What was up with Carter? My god, was he annoying. Always mad and angry, but for no reason. Devon Sawa and Ali Larter were the only decent things in this film, with their great performance. I did enjoy Sawa's character, Alex, being all investigative. We needed more of that and less characters getting killed in over the top ways, just for the sake of getting killed that way. I mean, was I supposed to be excited during the scene where a guy gets garrotted to death in a bathtub by a wire? That was just totally unjustified and disturbing (and I've seen even more brutal stuff).It seems like Death in the film was personified. I did not really like that. There wasn't much explanation on its personification, nor was there any reason for it. The opening scene, with all the characters introduced, and the airplane crash was really entertaining to watch. And, as said, I did enjoy Alex investigative and inquisitive nature. I would've preferred if this were a film with just him and Clear Rivers, who are chased by death and are racing against time to save their own lives. Think, something like The Ring (2002). But nah, instead they made this more in the likes of Halloween and Scream.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
A fresh and entertaining approach to horror,"It is refreshing to see a film that innovates.  The last film to do that in the horror genre was `Scream'.  `Final Destination' has introduced an inventive approach to the genre, giving it a supernatural killer rather than a lunatic slasher dress up in some kind of costume.  Using `Death' as the killer opens up myriad possibilities for the method of death and choice of victims.  This film was excellent at presenting the supernatural stalker's manipulation of the physical world to find murder weapons in everyday objects.  While the concept of Death taking people from earth is hardly new in films, the idea of Death as a malevolent attacker that has a plan that can be outwitted is a novelty.This film is the germination of an interesting direction, but does not bring the concept to maturation.  It is unsophisticated in its storytelling and the characters lack subtlety and realism in their reactions to their situation.  They are undifferentiated from their hollow horror counterparts in that regard, just fodder for the beast.Director James Wong, who has mostly TV credits on his resume, breaks into feature films with a vengeance.  From the standpoint of the photography and visual effects, the film was excellent.  His camera perspectives were creative and lent greater force to the suspense.  His crafting of the scenes was less effective.  The prescient clues to the next murder lacked nuance. There were no surprises except perhaps the last murder.  The formula was always the same, Alex predicts a murder and then rushes frantically to prevent it with mixed results.As is often the case in this genre, the acting had a broad range from terrible to very good.  Devon Sawa was excellent.  He gave his character much more range and depth than we are used to seeing from horror heroes.  He was the closest to having genuine human responses to the tragedies, at least in the beginning of the film.  Ali Larter was good as Clear, but her character didn't have much range and she did little to expand the envelope. The same is true of Kerr Smith whose character had even less dimensionality. On the awful side, there were Daniel Robuck and Roger Guenveur Smith as the hapless FBI agents and Tony Todd as the completely implausible undertaker.This was an entertaining film and a terrific story concept.  I rated it an 8/10.  It is a must-see for horror fans, but still enjoyable for a broader audience.  Few films of this genre have the potential to improve in the sequel.  This may be one of them.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great concept, garbage result","I know it's a popular horror movie, but how does it matter.The acting is quite ridiculous, cinematography is poor and amateurish, the only good thing in this movie is the concept of Death being fooled by people saved from it.

That's it.I love the scene where one char makes a lot of precautions to avoid death in his apartment though.Is that even a great concept ? I mean, Death doesn't really care about us. It's not personal, you know. Death just makes sure some people die frequently, it's not like it's gonna make a complex, tedious chain reaction to kill you, and specifically you. You escaped a plane crash. Whatever, dude, Death is just gonna kill some old people instead. You know.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fresh and Compelling Horror Flick,"Alex (Devon Sawa) has a premonition that flight 180 to Paris will explode on take off, he and some of his school colleagues get of the plane and survive the disaster; but death is still in their destiny and it's coming back for them.With a very refreshing and original storyline, Final Destination is simply compulsive viewing from start to finish. It still has many hallmarks from the teen slasher genre, most notable of these is the slightly corny dialogue, but it doesn't distract from the enjoyment too much. The cast is strong, the deaths scenes are shocking and usually unexpected, even if they are a little over-elaborate at times, and the direction is pretty smart and very tight.Overall this film entertains, and it is great fun when all you want to do is relax and watch - no thinking required.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Only one thing makes a movie like this enjoyable...,"QUALITY KILLS!!!  A good death scene can make up for all the re-hashed formula-based waste of film leading up to it.  But this movie goes one better.  It's actually pretty good on top of having some first rate gore.It's a classic slasher picture except that the killer this time is the angel of death himself.  He's a little ticked off at Alex and some of his classmates, because they managed to get themselves off of a plane that blows up right after it takes off.  Alex only intends to get himself off the plane, but some admittedly thin circumstances take place, and before you know it, 7 total get off the plane.  The reaper figures he had seven more deaths coming, so he's going to keep trying until he gets them.  Slowly but surely, those that cheated death start to get picked off in some unusual ways.  Alex seems to be at the center of all of this because he keeps showing up right as people die.  So the FBI thinks he's doing them in.  We, of course, know that he's not.  Alex knows when death is coming, because he's learned to look for the signs.  He also has figured out a way to tell who's going to be next.It wasn't all good though.  The character Carter's actions are just stupid. There's no plausible explanation for them so they come off as silly.  Other than that, once you accept the premise, the fun can begin.

A decent idea turned into a fantastic horror movie!,"""Final Destination"" caught me completely by surprise. After watching the trailer I figured it to be another typical teenage driven horror movie with little substance or unique qualities to set it apart from the pack. I'm really glad I gave it a go after reading a few good reviews though, as it turned out to be so very much more than that. This is a rare and wonderful case where an at most decent idea is turned into a really fantastic film due to good performances, direction and great scripting.Without giving too much of the story away, let me just say that Alex manages to avoid death under very strange circumstances. In doing so, he also saves the lives of five of his schoolmates as well as his teacher. But when one of those near-victims then dies soon after, Alex starts to fear that perhaps by cheating death, Death itself is coming back to set things straight. Sounds silly right! Well I guess it is, but it works really well in ""Final Destination"" and that's a credit to director James Wong and his cast and crew.When any and every normal item and scenario suddenly becomes an opportunity for Death to end your existence, life itself becomes a terrifying experience. The creators of this movie had a huge amount of fun with the setup, constantly placing obvious dangers in front of the characters only to have them harmlessly pass them by. Over and over you will find yourself thinking ""he's turned the radio on in bathroom, he's gonna get it!"" or ""that gas has been on for far too long for her to light it, this is it for her!"" only to have nothing happen. There are some brilliant scenes in ""Final Destination"" based on this uncertainty and each one finishes with highly creative and often unexpected death scenes.The cast are great and in particular Devon Sawa and Ali Larter in two of the main roles. But everyone plays their part in the scenario successfully except for perhaps Seann William Scott who funnily enough went on to be the most successful actor. He hadn't quite perfected his goof-ball antics at this point and while he's mildly amusing, he far more regularly appears to be quite pathetic and annoying. Tony Todd (of Candyman fame) has an unforgettable cameo which was a nice touch also utilizing a legend of the genre.There's a real sense of fun to proceedings even though death is a rather serious topic and that's due to the creators not taking things too seriously themselves. They are playing with you as an audience and rather than frustrating everyone as could so easily have occurred, you'll find yourself happily going along for the ride. This movie was a complete success and with two sequels already released to both financial reward and fan praise, we may not have seen the final Final Destination just yet.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
I'll see you soon!,"Before taking off for Paris, Alex Browning has a vision that the plane is going to explode. Pannicking he gets off the plane and in the m√™l√©e a teacher and a group of his class mates are forced off the flight, the plane goes on to explode in mid air, killing everyone on board. But pretty soon after the disaster strange accidents start to befall those who got off the plane, it seems that death is out to get them.With the number of hugely disappointing teens in peril movies that were made post the success of Wes Craven's hugely successful Scream, it's refreshing to find one that was, well, refreshing. Not purporting to be anything other than a wickedly entertaining piece of horror based nonsense, Final Destination is inventive, funny and above all else, shock laden.From the opening, and terrifying air crash sequence to the clever and gross way that our protagonists shake hands with the grim reaper, this film is gloriously proud of its horror intent. One peak at the surnames of the characters will tell you just how into their horror roots the makers are here, whilst not a homage movie as such, James Wong and his team clearly know what makes a modern horror picture work.If you find yourself complaining about the writing then you clearly are missing the point of Final Destination's existence, either that or you are in fact dead yourself!

Remember TWA 800?,"There are some very unfortunate parallels with this film and the TWA 800 disaster 3 years ago. Not only is the flight number quite similar, that plan was also destined for Paris. The other obvious coincidence is that the TWA flight also carried a group of students and teachers who as far as I am aware all died on board. I'm not sure where they got the television footage, but I hope it was not from that flight.Apart from that, the film was obvious and unfortunately not very scary at all. The characters were not expended upon, and the things they said and did, didn't always make a lot on sense. (At least in keeping with the character.)There were a lot of loose ends, like the bloke in the undertakers. (Was he death?) And the impossible was constantly happening.Poor, avoid.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great idea completely wasted,"A really eerie, intelligent, disturbing movie could have been made with this story.  A group of people get off a plane at the last second because one person has a horrifying premonition of death; after they've gotten off, the plane does indeed crash.  However, they were SUPPOSED to die as well, and since they haven't, Death, a living, conscious entity, is going to find them and finish the job.  Sounds like a great idea, huh?Unfortunately, in the wake of SCREAM, I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and URBAN LEGEND, the producers decided they'd make more money with a movie directed at stupid teeny-boppers than intelligent viewers.  The dialogue is plagued by the usual self-conscious SCREAM-like in-jokes, hip young (i.e. obnoxious, good-looking) characters and plot holes you could drive a semi through.There are a couple of decent scenes.  A scene in which a boy slips and gets entangled by the shower curtain cord until he chokes to death is effectively grotesque, and a sequence in which the main character locks himself in a cabin to escape Death is well done.  But the rest of the movie is as predictable, obvious and boring as any other post-SCREAM teen horror flick. The main character becomes a suspect in the deaths, a love interest develops between him and a female survivor (WOW, now there's a surprise), and, of course, there's the obligatory twist ending, which anyone who's seen more then one horror movie will see coming from a mile away.Followed by an equally idiotic sequel.

Innovative Horror,"Final Destination is a pretty tight paced supernatural horror movie. The main lead, character actor Devon Sawa - but why do I keep confusing him with Johnny Lee Miller and Joshua Jackson? Anyway, he leads a cast of High School students (yeah, right) who are about to go on vacation to Paris. All before the flight, he has strange premonitions of death, and when he finally boards, he sees flashes of what horrible things could happen to the plane.As he is dragged off in a panic, six of his fellow students and a teacher follow him or are thrown off for being disorderly. Guess what, something bad happens to the plane they were supposed to die on, but death hasn't finished with them yet.Pretty good, innovative, attractive cast and even a guest appearance from Tony Todd (Candyman). Yes, they're all way too old to be in High School, yes, you could argue that it's just another teens in trouble movie, but the concept is fresh, and so are the solutions they have to come up with, which is all I can ask for after watching over 20 years of horror movies.Not flight movie material, but well recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Just when you thought it was safe to listen to John Denver . . .,"Chalk this up to another really good premise ruined with an atrocious script and an unoriginal follow through.  What would have been interesting to find out is why Devon Sawa's character was let in on Death's design but this is not the flaw of this film.  With some hilarious death scenes and general overall creepy tone, Final Destination could have been the next Scream (which every horror film released since 1996 has been so desperately trying to be).  However, Final Destination does not have the same tongue-in-cheek sense of humor that Scream had.  The film takes itself way too seriously when it just should have had more fun with its good ideas.  Instead the audience is forced to listen to a ludicrous dialogue.  With that said, the film is actually a blast if expectations are held low.  The death scenes are extremely graphic and were usually unexpected.  If it weren't for the bus killing and the beheading, Final Destination would just be another House on Haunted Hill, The Haunting, Disturbing Behavior, Urban Legend, etc., etc., etc.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

REALLY good!,"Alex is a normal kid, what I think is a change of you look at all the movies with leads that had a unhappy youth are the ones that are spoiled as hell. I think all the performances are really good. And adding 'Stiffler' to the cast was really a good idea. Because, despise it's a hard ass thriller, it doesn't mean that you aren't allowed to smile once in a while. Kerr Smith playing the jock, wasn't that smart I think because everyone knows him as ""Jack"" from ""Dawsons Creek"" as always laughing, sensitive and sweet. I saw him that way, anyway. Alex wasn't that HOT (at least not as hot as Kerr Smith) but he was really good. I must say, I was really surprised by his skills. And because he wasn't really famous, it makes the story more believable.I saw the movie for the first time and 2001, then I was 11 so, I didn't really remember when I watched him again yesterday.

Okay horror flick from ex-X-Files talent,"This film had a definitely inserting concept, that a group of teens who have ""cheated"" death after abruptly departing an airplane that ends up exploding upon takeoff, who then find themselves fighting for their lives as death stalks them in the form of a series of elaborate fatal and/or near fatal accidents and mishaps (ranging from seemingly simple bathroom slip and falls, to downed power lines, to elaborate car and train sequences). The film was written and directed by ""X-Files"" veterans Glen Morgan and James Wong, so from a technical standpoint, it's a well crafted film with excitement, suspense, and thrills. However, I'm not sure the film's premise was enough to sustain a feature length film. It also doesn't help that the characters are not all that interesting, though it is kind of fun to see a young Ali Larter. Overall, this film this lacked story and characters to sustain itself, but the elaborate death sequences were interesting and suspenseful enough to hold my interest and make the film worth watching.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

His girlfriend Terry(Amanda Detmer) met her end to a bus, and everyone else die in a certain fashion that is unusually predictable to death that is. Avoiding death is unlikely impossible, but cheating death is more dangerous than that.

Sleeper,"Final Destination(2000) is a very good film that was brutally cut and hurt by the censors.  Has its weaknesses including the lame ending.  One of the two alternative endings should have been used because the film would have been much better.  Inspired by the style of The X Files with the tone of Scream.The dream sequence during the opening moments are nightmarishly portrayed. The scene where Alex Browning sweats it out and exists the plane only to see the plane blow up in mid air reminds me of a scene in Get Shorty(1995) where there is a similar sitution.  What the film says is that you cannot escape your destiny no matter what course of action you take.  This was something that was also important in the Lucio Fulci Giallo, Seven Notes in Black(1977).Final Destination(2000) is in my opinion the best film in the post Scream explosion because there is an attempt at creativity.  The special effects in the film are some of the best in late 1990s teen horror films.  The death scenes are reminiscent of the glory days of Dario Argento, Mario Bava, and Lucio Fulci.  I hope that there will be a director's cut of Final Destination released on DVD just to see how better the film would be.The death sequence involving the teacher is the highlight of the film.  The actors perform decently as the pawns who try to escape death.  Final Destination(2000) uses ideas from Don't Look Now(1972), Seven Notes in Black(1977), The Eyes of Laura Mars(1978), & The Dead Zone(1983).  Final Destination(2000) was competently directed by X-Files member, James Wong.",,Anonymous,Horror
The best movie of all time!,"Not only are the death scenes in this movie are thrilling, but this movie is what I call 'genuine original horror'. Often when we watch other horror movies that include monstrous creatures, psychotic killers, and weird ghosts or spirits like 'The Ring', this particular villain in Final Destination is the Grim Reaper. The Grim Reaper is a devilish spirit in who some of us believe and some of us don't. In this movie, I believe the tension will crawl up in your nerves, and possibly in the end thinking up of the question - Does the Grim Reaper really exist? or Is it true that some people who die of freak accidents are really stalked by Death or just coincidences? Death is what I would call the most inevitable villain, watching you at all times. Death does not appear in front of your eyes and is an invisible presence.

Finality of Death,"'Final Destination' is a film built on a great premise: death is preordained and accidentally thwarting it will result in fate, death itself, a universal power coming to get you and kill you as per the original plan. The drama being in the characters realisation of this and their attempts to ""survive death"" as it were, that is, to avoid being killed by death.This is a great device for a different horror film from the norm and it certainly gets some wonderful set pieces where death elaborately ""stalks"" it's ""victims"" which illuminates the inevitability and unavoidability of this fate.Along with the performance of Devon Sawa this is the main merit of 'Final Destination'. Sawa gives quite a balanced lead performance, gradually growing as his predicament develops, and maintaining a continuity of character in the process. The supporting cast gives less convincing performances but usually they keep in tune with the tone ok.The film has some flat bits and some very odd character behaviours, which isn't a complement on the writing; the direction is at its best with the deadly set pieces and the effects and action sequences are effective here also. There are scenes where the direction and writing are downright flat, or confused and these usually involve secondary or peripheral characters. This is a shame and it greatly diminishes the overall effect.'Final Destination' certainly has an intimacy with its protagonist which is to be applauded in a horror film and this is helped by Sawa's performance in the part.I rate at 5/10 because the scenario and the handling of the lead role are very good.I recommend to horror fans of unusual horrors and dark chillers.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Worthwhile horror-classic,"After almost 25 years this first chapter of the franchise hasn't lost any of its freshness. The story is still original and solid and (considering that the viewers back then didn't know what was coming) the intricate ways in which the subsequent deaths are staged are impressive and exciting, with many effective jump scares as well as at other times some equally effective slow building-up of the tension.Maybe the complicated juggling with the question of precedence as to who after each kill would be the next victim, went a bit over people's head (well, at least over mine!), but I found that also the case in most of the sequels. The acting of all concerned is fine, and each character gets some modest background, so that you actually could care for them.In short: a fine and still very worthwhile horror-classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't watch if you are getting on an airplane any time soon!,"This ""horror film"" tries a bit too hard, but is fairly entertaining at the same time.  It's certainly no Exorcist, but then again, I don't think that movie will ever be topped as far as the fear/intensity level is concerned.Sitting in a plane waiting for takeoff for a school vacation, Alex (Devon Sawa) has a vision that the plane will explode shortly after takeoff.  He goes nuts, he and some of his friends (and one teacher/chaperone) get kicked off the plane, and lo and behold, it explodes shortly after takeoff.  Amidst suspicion, Alex watches as his friends are picked off one by one by the force that had intended to kill them all on the plane, if not for their untimely escape.This one gets some points for special effects (the plane crash ""vision"" at the beginning is superb!) and gore, but loses points for storyline.  This is just too contrived, and predictable.  It's the old ""we were supposed to die but we didn't and now it's coming back to finish us off"" theme.  I found that waiting to see who was going to die next, and in what fashion, was the most entertaining thing about this film.  Some of the methods, while nothing new, are portrayed quite well with the use of special effects.This is obviously an attempt to cash in on the recent return of teen-slasher flicks, with a slightly new angle.  Over all, it's not too bad, but it could have been a little better in the storyline department.  It's a cast of unknowns, too, so don't expect any Academy Award winning performances here.My Rating:  5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Oh, dear...","This was not a good film. That I am sure of. The alarm bells started to ring about 5 minutes into the film, with the ridiculous style of direction - trying to be all modern and cool and keep the pace going, but still missing something - making a massive point of emphasising all of the little 'signs' of what was to come - these are the sort of things any director who assumed even a little intelligence in their audience would make a lot more subtle.After the intro, there were very few redeeming features. As I watched I continued to get bogged down in the really awful, long and drawn out deaths, which had me almost cringing in embarrassment, the laughable dialog and acting in places (Tony Todd's 'creepy' undertaker was unbelievably poor), and the sheer predictability of the film as a whole.In summary? Don't bother - this is one of those awkward films - it's not good enough to be a fun film, and it's not bad enough to be a fun film. If you want to see a good horror film, get the Shining.

imaginative thriller that overdoses on special effects,"`Final Destination' is a fairly creepy, moderately entertaining little horror film dedicated to the proposition that, although one may not be able to exactly `cheat' death, one may be able to beat it on its own terms fair and square ¬ñ provided one can figure out the rules that is.The movie begins as a group of forty high school students and three of their teachers board a plane departing from JFK on a field trip to Paris. Immediately before takeoff, one student receives a premonition that the plane will explode moments after becoming airborne, a vision that manages to get himself and several other passengers safely off before the inevitable occurs.  But as Alex and his fellow survivors soon discover, Death is not to be avoided quite so easily, as each becomes the target of a systematic plan of elimination.If the details of the initial premise sound familiar, it is probably because they match almost perfectly those surrounding the downing of Flight 103 back in 1996.  Waving aside questions of taste and propriety ¬ñ is it really right to use the details of a real life tragedy as fodder for a silly little horror flick? ¬ñ let us concede that `Final Destination' taps into some pretty basic fears about the uncertain, random and arbitrary nature of Death.  The idea itself is enough to make us all stop and ponder the truth of our mortality and the truly tenuous thread by which we daily cling to this thing we call life.  But like so many horror films in the modern era, the premise is better than the execution.  The various deaths depicted herein become so choreographed and preposterous in their details that they actually end up diluting some of their own ability to disturb and terrify. Indeed, the more elaborate and high tech the death scenes become, the less creepy they seem.  We become bemused and detached when we should be cringing and empathetic.  Death simply has to work too hard in some of these scenes and the strain shows.Thus, for all its originality of premise, the film, by making Death seem like nothing more disturbing than a conventional special effects showoff, robs Man's greatest enemy of his awe-inspiring and overwhelming power and sting!",,Anonymous,Horror
A real surprise packet - tense and well made,"From the trailer, I was not expecting much from 'Final Destination'. How wrong I was! A gripping, physically wracking horror-thriller that really succeeds in generating tension. And that was on video!Well worth watching.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"OK, but not my cup of tea","I've never cared much for the gore subgenre of horror films, and that holds true here, so if you think my rating is too low, I will concede the point. Having said that, this film doesn't go nearly as far overboard with gore as many do. Plus, the subject matter leads many of the characters into existentialist discussions, which carries some measure of interest. Photography is nice and the effects are good for their time. I can't really recommend it, but if you like horror films it might be worth your while. I've certainly seen many which were MUCH worse.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Terrific 'Destination',"What made ""Final Destination"" so great was that it had a different approach to horror films. It wasn't your typically teenage-slasher flick type of movie with some madman hacking people to death with an ax. Instead, it dealt with the subject of 'death.'Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) gets some of his classmates and a teacher off a plane which, he claims after having a dream, will explode. After the plane DOES explode, those Alex pulled off the plane begin to die, one by one. This just proves that, according to the film's tag-line, 'you can't cheat death.'The ways the characters die are violent, but oddly realistic. The characters themselves make sense, and the direction by James Wong (of TV's 'The X Files') is great.As you watch the film, you can't help but think that one day, your day will come. It's a very morbid thought, but true -- and the film says so.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
