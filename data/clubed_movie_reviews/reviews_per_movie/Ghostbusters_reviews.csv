A severely underrated film,"What's that you say? Ghostbusters, one of the most financially successful and over-hyped comedies of the eighties, underrated? Yes. Precicely because it was so over-hyped and made so much money, there has been a stigma attached to this film identifying it as a childish FX piece, when it is nothing of the sort. Most of the lines people remember(""He slimed me,"" ""OK. So? She's a dog,"" ""When someone asks you if you're a god, you say YES!"") are not its funniest or wittiest lines, which often are missed on first or even second viewing. I laugh every time I observe a gag or a quip that I somehow missed the other 20 times I viewed a scene; ""Egon, this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole through your head, remember that?"" ""That would have worked if you hadn't stopped me"", or, to the driver of a van from a loony bin, ""Dropping off or picking up?"" Brilliant.Not only is Ghostbusters funny, it manages to include some truly scary scenes. And not just lose-your-popcorn moments like the fridge from Hell, but also scenes of quiet, thoughtful chill, like Egon's retelling of how the possessed apartment building came into being, or Winston recalling the Book of Revelation. Which other film has managed to combine the Marx Brothers with HP Lovecraft?The special effects hold up well, besides some obvious studio sets and models, but what really creates this film's world is the stunning cinematography. Manhattan, perhaps the pinnacle of Gothic architectural evolution, is brilliantly utilised here to create a sense of menacing grandeur. After watching ""Ghostbusters"" I couldn't imagine the realm of the Old Gods opening into our world from anywhere else. The soundtrack is great, not the overrated theme (Which was in fact lifted from Huey Lewis' ""I Need a New Drug""), but the wonderfully blusey ""Cleaning Up the Town,"" the creepy proto-techno chiller ""Magic"" and also the wonderful score by the late and much lamented Elmer Bernstein.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"""who ya gonna call......?""","Ghostbusters was an incredibly huge smash hit on its original release back in `84  and its not hard to see why - its a  funny , exciting  and imaginative  thrill ride. There is a lot to like about  ghostbusters , like bill Murrays  constant and always funny wise cracks,  the films constant shift  from a light hearted comedy to  intense ghost busting thriller and of course , the technically flawless attack of the marsh mallow man  that is probably one of my favorite parts of this film.In this day and age of computer generated  fx wizardry   the completely analogue special effects  still look  great ( especially the stay puft marsh mallow man , its rampage through the city   looks incredibly   real ! ) and the film it self is still better and more imaginative  than  a lot of event movies you will find in a cinema near you  today .And to top it all off  Ghostbusters is one of the few films out there that actually  had  worthy TV spin off that was the ""real Ghostbusters"", a cartoon that  i loved as a kid.Ghostbusters is a film that truly deserves its iconic status.The screen dwellers mark (out of 5 ) : * * * *",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Still Very Funny & Entertaining,"There is no set definition of the word ""classic"" but I'm sure this film qualifies as such or will in the near future, since it was so unique and popular....and remains so today, over 20 years old later. It's just one of those films that you remember seeing when it came out at the theaters. I doubt if anyone has forgotten the catchy theme song, either.Despite numerous viewings, I still find this very funny as I suspect many people do, because it entertains so well. I know the story is ludicrous and I don't believe for one second in ghosts so I ignore the ""theology"" and just laugh at Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, Harold Ramis, Rick Moranis, Annie Potts and Ernie Hudson.Murray, as he tends to do, grabs the spotlight more than the rest and delivers more laughs than any of the cast but my favorite was Moranis as the nerdy ""Louis Tully."" I wish his role had been bigger. All the guys, however, plus Sigourney Weaver, the love interest of the always-horny Murray, are fun. I even liked the sequel because most of this cast was included.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
My favorite film as a child and still brilliant today!,"I have special affection for this film. When I was a youngster, growing up between the ages of four and ten, this was my favorite film. I loved the whole Ghostbusters thing. I loved the sequel, the cartoon series, I had to have the toys and merchandise every Christmas, you name it. Strangely, as I have gotten older, I find myself appreciating the film more and more. When I was a child I loved it for the special effects, the gadgets and the ghostbusting especially. Nowadays I love it for the same reasons, but now that I'm older I find myself appreciating the dialog which is some of the funniest committed to a film, the oddball humor, like Venkman's line about dogs and cats living together and the in jokes, like Slimer being the ghost of John Belushi and Venkman rubbing his hand at glee at the thought of the money to be made from the merchandising of the ghostbusters brand. Not only that, but some 80's hairstyles aside, the film as aged remarkably well. My cousin who is five years old has developed a love for the whole Ghostbusters thing, showing that this is truly worthy of being branded one of the most successful films ever made.Unlike many of today's blockbusters which are humorless and pompous thinking that they are serious films and forgetting about any sense of fun along with the complicated visual effects, Ghostbusters is funny and a fun paranormal movie. The set pieces are superb as we see the Ghostbusters going up against Slimer, Gozer and, undeniably the classic movie moment of the 80's, the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. For a film made in 1984 the climax is very well done and looks exceedingly realistic, without any hint of clues as to the fact that it is a special effect. This is what going to the cinema should be all about. Fun with a capital F. All the actors get into it with great comedic aplomb. Bill Murray, one of the finest comedy actors to grace the screen, is superb as Peter Venkmen who gets the best lines in the film as well as the funniest moments. Just check out the ""there is no Dana, only Zool"" moment. Murray's priceless reaction to Dana Barrett's possession is one of the most side splitting moments I have ever seen. In fact, the casting is pretty much spot on. As well as Murray, we have co writers Dan Akyroyd and Harold Ramis sharing the spotlight as the fellow Ghostbusters, Sigourney Weaver making a wonderful damsel in distress, Rick Moranis is almost scene stealing as her nerd of a  neighbor who becomes possessed himself, while Ernie Hudson and Annie Potts both put in wonderfully sardonic supporting roles who get their chances to shine.Add to this one of the best theme tunes and a truly apocalyptic finale, it is no surprising that this was the biggest film of 1984. A summer blockbuster with humor, trills, spills and some of the best special effects money could buy at the time, this is truly a genuine classic and is one of the best Hollywood blockbusters ever made.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
A timeless classic,"There aren't many movies better than Ghostbusters. This film expertly balances itself right between the horror genre and the comedy genre. The chemistry of the main three characters is undeniable, and when you throw in interesting side characters (such as Rick Moranis as Louis Tully), every scene is a delight to watch. The story is original, the effects are impressive and the jokes are funny - in short, Ghostbusters is a timeless classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Classic, original, best supernatural comedy's masterpiece!","This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, puppetry, models, and CGI.Ghostbusters (1984) is the best classic original spectacular supernatural masterpiece from Ivan Reitman! One of if not the greatest films ever! My favorite film of all time! ""Ghostbusters"" is the film that made me become a fan ever since I was young! It had an awesome cast, cool special effects, hilarious dialogue and a kick-ass soundtrack! The film that can be watched over and over again! I grew up watching Ghostbusters on TV and the animated TV series The Real Ghostbusters (1986 - 1991). Ghostbusters II (1989) actually introduced me in to Ghostbusters. I loved them so much that I even said to my mom, when I grown up I will be a Ghostbuster! It was my fantasy. Watching it yesterday and I still love it. I love this flick to death! I still can't believe it how the world changed and how in the 80's the world was better than today! I always have enjoyed the sequel much better than as a child, it was my first movie but now as an adult, I love and enjoy the original movie to death! It is the only movie I own on Blu-ray disc and I still love it.This is an amazing movie! Funny, smart, well written and directed. It features an outstanding performance from Bill Murray, great showings by Harold Ramis, Rick Moranis and one of the last documented instances of Dan Aykroyd being funny on film (he was blown by a ghost!). In fact, the film gets a great performances from nearly everyone who appears in it- from Annie Potts, to the guy who played Lenny the Mayor, to the handsome cab driver who calls Rick Moranis an asshole. In addition, they had one of the best ""a-hole"" guys ever to appear on film, as the film's bad guy- I'm talking of course of the grossly under-rated William Atherton- who played the EPA guy, ""Dickless"". Atherton, of course went on to play memorable a-holes in Real Genius and of course he was the annoying reporter in Die Hard (1988) but here in Ghostbusters, you really see a solid performance by maybe the best guy to play an a-hole in films in the 80's.Next Year the reboot is coming out as Paul Feig's Ghostsnuters, Ghostbitches or Ghostflufers./: Ghostbusters (2016) with women now as a Ghostbusters! Why rebooting this awesome supernatural spectacular comedy flick? I know the sequel failed and Bill Murray did not want anything to do with it. But that doesn't mean that they shouldn't have made Ghostbusters III in the 90's, they should have! Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis tried so hard to convince Bill Murray to do it for the third sequel and they couldn't convinced him. They are going to ruin the Original movie! I don't want to see Ghostbusters with a female leads. Come on? The girls are not the Ghostbusters, they are three man a scientists and a one civilian. The Ghostbusters are the only one Harold Ramis, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson and Bill Murray. They were always be the Ghostbusters that will be the case. No one else will be! No one else will replace them! This is like A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) that come out the same year as the Ghostbusters did, they remake it and that remake failed!! It was awful boring! Why remaking or rebooting my classic horror comedy's that I Love?! Ghostbusters (1984) are unique, classic 80's masterpiece! These were the best times for movies ever!!! One of my favorite soundtracks and movie of all time!They just don't make them like this anymore. This is comedic writing and performance at its peak... with quotes that everyone knows and enjoys. From ""This reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head"" to ""Symmetrical book stacking. Just like the Philadelphia mass turbulence of 1947"" to ""Many Shuvs and Zuuls knew what it was to be roasted in the depths of the Slor that day, I can tell you! "" this is a CLASSIC movie! Ghostbusters is a true classic comedy that stands the test of time. The film is funny, awesome and entertaining. It has a lot of laughs. I love the soundtrack Ghostbusters Written and Performed by Ray Parker Jr. I think he did made a great soundtrack in the 80's. If there's something strange in your neighborhood, who you gonna call? GHOSTBUSTERS!!!! A film that can be watched with the various youngest to the very oldest of the family. Wonderful collection of characters. A film that is treasured by just about everyone that watches it. I miss movies from the 80's and this film felt so realistic. Sigourney Weaver was just so outstanding as Dana Barrett after she made the horror flick Alien (1979 and Aliens (1986).Ghostbusters is a 1984 American supernatural comedy film, directed and produced by Ivan Reitman and written by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis.

Still pretty good,"Many comedies age poorly, but I thought that this one has held up pretty well. Lots of special effects (which have also held up pretty well) but the comedy does not get lost in them.

Great marriage of comedy and spookiness,"Very rarely can you pull off a successful blend of two separate movie genres,but the makers of Ghostbusters were overwhelmingly so.On the one hand,you have the comedic charm of Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd,and on the other,a genuine ghostly spookiness that makes you want to hide under a blanket.I recently bought a copy and watched it for the first time in several years,and it's still just as fresh as it was in it's initial release in 1984.It has a great supporting cast for Murray and Aykroyd,including the always great Sigourney Weaver,Rick Moranis,Ernie Hudson,and Harold Ramis,who is just as talented behind the camera as he is in front of it.Watch it with your family,but keep an eye on younger children,as the spookiness may be more than they can handle. Great stuff.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"There's something weird, and it don't look good.","After losing their university grant, paranormal scientists Dr Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Dr. Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), and Dr. Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) set up business as Ghost Busters, professional exterminators for those with supernatural pests, unaware that New York is soon to become plagued by spooks as an ancient Sumerian God named Gozer prepares to enter our realm.When Ghost Busters was originally released, way back in 1984 (bloody hell, that's a quarter of a century ago!!!), cinema audiences went wild for the supernatural adventures of spook wranglers Venkman and Co.: the film was the definition of an 80s, crowd-pleasing blockbuster, with an impressive cast of hot comedy names, a script packed with witty one liners, bucket-loads of flashy, state-of-the-art special effects, and, of course, a catchy theme song that couldn't fail to please.So this afternoon, I sat down to re-live the magical experience with my children (aged 6 and 8), but to my disappointment, discovered that the film really hasn't aged that well. Despite some classic moments of dry humour from Bill Murray, the impressive sight of a Godzilla-size Mr. Stay Puft trashing New York, and the even more impressive sight of Sigourney Weaver's lovely, long legs, the film just isn't as great as my memory had led me to believe: it's rather cheap looking at times, with shonky props, unconvincing sound-stage sets, and crowd-scenes of, oh, at least 50 people; the effects that once dazzled now look embarrassingly bad, with iffy stop motion animation, crap matte work, random flashy lights, and Richard Edlund's Oscar nominated 'ink in water' clouds looking just like... well, just like ink in water; and rather than being a roller-coaster ride of laughs and scares, the film is actually pretty dull at times. Sorry kids, but I was so sure that this film rocked; instead, it's just another passable piece of 80s nostalgia for the middle-aged.Oh well, at least the theme song is still a corker; all together now.... Who ya gonna call?",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
One of the funniest films of all time. Who ya gonna call? GHOSTBUSTERS!,"I have a small posse of favorite comedians. Somewhere towards the top of that list, along with Steve Martin, is Bill Murray. He's been around since the early 80s, getting his start on NBC's ""Saturday Night Live"" after Chevy Chase left for his own career in Hollywood. Murray worked live for a few years before -- like those prior to him him -- gradually making his way into the film world.I like all of the comedians in ""Ghostbusters,"" come to think of it. Dan Aykroyd is another great subtle comedian, with a great knack for writing as well as acting. It was Aykroyd, after all, who is primarily responsible for ""The Blues Brothers."" And Harold Ramis, who later became a director, with an impressive resume of such films as ""Vacation,"" ""Groundhog Day,"" and ""Analyze This.""Then there's also Rick Moranis, a meek nerd character who is very underrated and very funny, a sort of Woody Allen Lite. He was Dark Helmet in ""Spaceballs,"" Barney Coopersmith in ""My Blue Heaven,"" and that wacky inventor in ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids.""Yes, one could say that ""Ghostbusters"" is built on a firm base, scripted by Aykroyd, Ramis and Moranis (who is uncredited) and directed by Ivan Reitman (""Kindergarten Cop""). It's a clever little story with a simple premise and lots of laughs -- a band of failing friends unite to make a hoax ghost-busting company, but soon real ghosts do show up and they're in over their heads.It starts in New York City. Peter Venkman (Murray), Raymond Stanz (Aykroyd), and Egon Spengler (Ramis) are three Columbia University scientists laid off after their grant expires with no results from the trio in return. Down to nothing, they cook up the brilliant (or crazy) idea to create a ""ghost-busting"" company.But they immediately realize that it won't be as easy as it seems to get a little extra cash, because Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) comes to the men looking for help. Her apartment is infested with strange happenings, and her next-door neighbor, Louis Tully (Rick Moranis), is having problems of his own.They pretend to solve the situation and the men suddenly become a citywide phenomenon, attracting media attention and constant customers at their front door. They become so popular, in fact, that they are joined by Winston Zeddmore (Ernie Hudson), another down-on-his-luck city guy looking for a good-paying job.However, Walter Peck, EPA (William Atherton) doesn't believe that the Ghostbusters are really ridding any ghosts at all, so he has them thrown in jail. But an ethreal baddie named Gozer (Slavitza Jovan) soon appears in Dana's apartment complex, and weird happenings occur, forcing Peck to free the Ghostbusters once and for all so that they can bust the ghost and send it back to where it came from.Sounds corny, huh? It's meant to be. Everything about this movie is campy and goofy, and that is exactly what Ramis, Aykroyd and Moranis wanted when they collaborated. And it is very funny.I don't know, there's something in me that loves ""Saturday Night Live"" humor. Sure, the show has its dry spots, but I love it. Many people I know don't find it all that funny, and not as consistent as something such as ""The Simpsons,"" but I love to watch it, I love the humor, and I love the actors.Part of that love, I suppose, is what makes me enjoy ""Ghostbusters"" (1984) so much. However, believe it or not, ""Ghostbusters"" is not quite as laugh-out-loud funny as you might expect. It is very funny, but it isn't always a howler. It's more of an intelligent comedy, which is odd, since it is made by a band of guys from ""Saturday Night Live"" and such backgrounds.Murray steals every scene he is in. This, along with `Groundhog Day,' is the perfect vehicle for his comedic talents, ranging from the constant wise cracks to the constant dry ironic humor that I love so much. They key to his humor is not that he comes up with it, but the way he does it. Any comedian can use the blank glares, but the way he expressionlessly glares at fellow actors is a joke in itself. When Stanz admits that his one fear has always been the Stay Puff'd man, check out Murray's face. This is classic stuff.As much a scene-stealer as Murray may be, he is nearly upstaged by Aykroyd and Ramis, who both provide a sort of counter-balance of lunatics and reason to Murray's flippant characteristics. The scene that everyone remembers it the finale involving the giant marshmallow Stay Puff'd Man, and whenever I think of Aykroyd's performance in this film, I think of that scene.""Ghostbusters"" is a very famous comedy, and for good reason. It's light, good-hearted, funny, and actually pretty intelligent, built upon a firm cast and script, which -- considering the majority of the actors' and writers' backgrounds of ""Saturday Night Live"" -- is almost as surprising as the film itself.5/5 stars.John Ulmer",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Who you gonna call?,"Ghostbusters is a movie from 1984 starring Bill Murray (Groundhog Day, Lost in Translation, Moonrise Kingdom), Dan Aykroyd (The Blues Brothers, Ghostbusters Franchise, Trading Places), Harold Ramis (Groundhog Day, Analyze This, Ghostbusters Franchise) and Sigourney Weaver (Alien Franchise Avatar). It was written Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Rick Moranis (Honey I Shrunk the Kids, Spaceballs, Strange Brew) and is directed by Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters Franchise, Up in the Air, No Strings Attached).Ghostbusters follows three scientists: Peter (Bill Murray), Ray (Dan Aykroyd) and Egon (Harold Ramis) as they start their own ghost catching business and their biggest job yet is in a musician named Dana's (Sigourney Weaver) own refrigerator.This hilarious movie is carried by is fun characters brought to life by Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis. They are each very different and very funny in their own ways. Murray plays a classic, sarcastic Bill Murray character, Aykroyd plays a nervous quiet man who is really excited to be living out his dream and Ramis plays a very smart, nerdy, and odd man. They ad-lib most of their lines which makes this all even better.I actually think the success of Ghostbusters led to all of this ghost hunter reality show crap we see on TV today. This was the first movie to really have the idea of ghost hunting itself which means it is very original and started a ghost craze and a (not so good) sequel.Most of the effects in this movie do look quite dated while films like Blade Runner (which came out two years earlier) do not. But all of this adds to the fun of this incredibly fun, hilarious movie from the 80's.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Film Has Endured the 80's and Stayed Sharp Through the 90's,"Bill Murray is one of the best wise guys in the business.  I was amazed to find out on the GHOSTBUSTERS 15th Anniversary DVD that Murray had little to do with the dialogue his classicly blase, fiercely cynical 'Dr. Venkman' cuts loose throughout this good comedy.  Credit Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis with ""getting into Bill's mind"" as Ramis puts it and presenting Murray with a gag-a-second character.  Murray also lends his own comic genius through his delivery and facial gestures (especially with his classic cross-eyed, curled-lip look).  Together with a fun premise and above average special effects, GHOSTBUSTERS will never be a relic of the 80's and should always be a refreshingly humorous spook show.Murray rules the screen, mauling his geeky para-psychologist partners and hitting on a young blonde while conducting shock therapy experiments on her. Aykroyd uses his standard machine gun delivery of obscure (or should I say made up) facts and anecdotes and Ramis is just enough for the ultra-dork 'Egon'.  The funniest element in GHOSTBUSTERS happens to be Rick Moranis in a splendid role as a small-time accountant who has parties for clients only and becomes mixed up in some extremely supernatural events.  Along with Sigourney Weaver, Moranis has the most difficult physical tasks to topple.This was a picture I loved when I was a kid.  I must have went some 12 to 15 years before I saw it again and I was alarmingly impressed.  It has endured. The special effects are not only good, but they are comedic and add even more laughs throughout the 'Busters turbulent jobs.  The DVD version has tons of goodies included and is an essential addition to any Saturday Night Live fan's movie library.  SNL is the very essence and reason for GHOSTBUSTERS, where Murray and Aykroyd starred.  Director Ivan Reitman created his meal ticket here and can pretty much do any comedy he wants now.It is a shame John Belushi was not around to play one of the 'Busters, for he was originally cast.  The movie is already well-paced and engaging so just imagine how frenzied the pace would have been with Belushi. Regardless, GHOSTBUSTERS is one for the kids, teens, and adults alike.  It has spanned these phases for me and still works wonderfully.RATING: ***",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

This film was nearly perfect, but sadly still not made for everyone. It's an important film, as well as very entertaining. It starts in New York City. A gritty, hard movie about gritty hard people, but it's also intelligent. Sounds corny? It's meant to be goofy. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect.

Ghosts Busted!,"Ghostbusters has all the ingredients that go into the making of a good comedy. Subtlety, wit, good performances and a smart and crisp story. Three out-of-work, oddball scientists found a company that gets rid of ghosts from haunted places. They encounter myriad spirits and are put to test when they have to face the mother-of-all-ghosts in a riveting climax.The movie is just a cascade of one comedic situation after another and at the same time, we are also interested in the big picture. Bill Murray is one of the ghostbusters and his character is unusual for a scientist; he appears bored throughout the movie, when he is chasing ghosts or courting the Sigourney Weaver character. Weaver herself is brilliant as both the cynic and the temptress, before and after she is possessed respectively. All the supporting characters are memorable.

The direction was slick and self-assured, and there are a lot of truly funny lines in the script like ""Ray, if someone asks you if you are a god, you say yes"". I can't count the number of times I was laughing when I watched this film. The performances were brilliant. Bill Murray, who is excellent when he is given a great script, see him in Lost in Translation for evidence, steals every scene he's in, and Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis both gave spirited performances. Also fun to watch were Annie Potts and Rick Moranis, and Sigourney Weaver was her usual charming self here. I will confess when I first saw this I was frightened by the dog like creatures Zuul and Vinz Clortho.

Always entertaining...,"""Ghost Busters"" is and will always be a classic in every sense of the word. It is just one of those movies that never grows old and that can be watched again and again. It is a movie that is suitable for the entire family. Yes, it has something for everybody.There is no need to go into details about the story for ""Ghost Busters"" as it is a story that everyone with an interest in movies is familiar with, and if you aren't familiar with it, shame on you, I guess you have been hiding under a rock somewhere.Effect-wise then ""Ghost Busters"" is okay for a movie from 1984, and it most definitely was state of the art and visually impressive back in the day. Yes, certain effects are quite fake and poor by todays standards, but you bear with it because this is a movie driven by a solid story and a rich character gallery. And while not a main character, the ghost Slimer will always be remembered fondly when talking about ""Ghost Busters"".The acting is good, and there is a good ensemble of talents on the cast list. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson will always be the original Ghost Busters.

Must have worked better in the 80s,"""Ghost Busters"" is a 1984 comedic film that follows the jobs of 3 parapsychology scientists as they capture and destroy ghosts from their town.While searching for good comedy films to watch, the recommendation of ""Ghost Busters"" (1984) kept on coming up. I then remembered vaguely that there was a TV show version of the series. I never really watched even an episode, but I do remember seeing the opening credits and tidbits of the show here and there. So I thought I'd give it a try. I was in the mood for some laughs, after all.The film worked well in the first half. Though I never really laughed out loud, I could see that it was entertaining. But after the actual plot took place, I lost all interest. It became too boring and took away the movie's charm. The jokes started to get old, too. The visual effects didn't help keep my interest, either. I found my eyes drooping!I understand that this movie is pretty old, so it may have been amazing for people who watched it first when it came out in the 1980's, but when you watch it in the late 2000s, it doesn't really do anything for you.Viewed on: May 3, 2011",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"""We got one!""","The first thing that needs to be said is that Ghostbusters (1984) is possibly the funniest film ever. That's quite the bold statement to make but with good cause. This film holds up probably more than any other comedy in existence. You know how there are those movies that you see that are hysterical the first few times you see them? This one just keeps on coming. I remember when I was a kid, I wore our copy of Ghostbusters out. At the time, I thought it was a horror movie (I wasn't the brightest bulb) so I watched it constantly (Being that I am a horror buff) never realizing what it truly was. I hadn't yet caught on to a lot of the humor. About eight years later, I noticed that I hadn't seen the film for forever and a day. I popped it in and oh my God...I just about died with laughter.This movie has something for everyone. Director Ivan Reitman said that he found a comedic formula for films...it works as follows: There's the brain, the heart, and the mouth. Ghostbusters scored with all of them. As the brain of the bunch, Egon Spengler's (Harold Ramis also co-wrote it) use of witty humor is hilarious. If you have the right mind set, almost everything Spengler says is laugh out loud funny. At the heart of the Ghostbusters is Dan Aykroyd's (Who created the idea for the film) lovable fool, Ray Stantz. Ray has a tenacity for saying simple minded things and using very little logic and yet somehow the man got a P.H.D. (Probably through studying habits, despite ignorance.) There's a line that he says involving a smell in the beginning of the movie that I am chuckling at just thinking about it. This of course leaves Bill Murray (He was nominated for a Gloden Globe) as the sarcastic Peter Venkman (The mouth of the beast.) Peter is likely the one that gets the most laughs because he, being the mouth that he is, never stops making fun of everything. It's like Rodney Dangerfield in the party scene in Caddyshack but a whole lot funnier and continues the rest of the movie. The film also produces some laughter out of the minor characters as well. The scatological humor toward the end of the film between Rick Moranis (In a role intended for John Candy) and Sigourney Weaver is quite laughter inducing. Ernie Hudson in one of his first big roles has a few good lines as the other Ghostbuster, Winston Zeddmore (The only one who's not a doctor) and William Atherton of Die Hard fame plays the ultimate annoyance as Walter Peck. Not to be forgotten in the mix is Annie Potts as Janine who has some rather memorable humorous lines, for instance the one I've written to summarize the movie. Numerous other well known faces are seen on screen too, which includes John Belushi (Or rather his continuation of the character Bluto, from Animal House) as the principal image used for the now famous 'Disgusting Blob,' Slimer. Like any good comic will tell you, good comedy is generally about setting up the other guys around you. Well, it just so happens that the characters all work well with each other to set the great comedic moments staged in this film.Not to be forgotten however in all the funny one liners and set ups is the overall film. Ghostbusters was nominated for numerous awards including Oscars for best song (Courtesy of Ray Parker Jr.) and special effects, which are now slightly dated but possibly work even better with the wacky style being consistent with the rest of the movie. Along with Parker, there are numerous other great songs including a song by The Bus Boys that climbed charts and a rather creepy seeming song (But works well) by Mick Smiley. Another thing that should not be forgotten is the horror elements of the film. Though purposely outrageous, the effects do serve as some potential scare moments. Among the most frightening involve stop motion animated puppets called Terror Dogs. Though the scares are few, they do work fairly well (They had me convinced as a youngster) bringing enough threat to the ghosts that haunt New York City. The story itself is interesting as well, involving some intriguing mythology of Sommeria among other countries.Where some films tend to only work a few times, Ghostbusters is consistent. Although, I've found movies such as CLUE, Dr. Strangelove or Airplane to be funnier at different times in my life, this one still makes me laugh even after seeing it hundreds of times. From the opening scares to the ending credits, it will almost surely reel you in. I've laughed harder at some moments in other films but it's rare that I find one that's funnier throughout. Even those films lose their edge after you see them a few times...this one just doesn't. If you haven't seen it, do so. You will almost certainly be glad you did. If you have seen it and didn't like it, try watching it again in a few years. It's almost sure to grow on you eventually. I dare anyone to sit through this movie and not laugh once, no matter how many times they've seen it. If you don't laugh, you're either trying really hard to hold back, have a very odd sense of humor or are dead! It's just that funny. Although I don't rate films, I would easily rate this one a five out of five, placed among the classics. Believe it or not, I think that it belongs alongside Citizen Kane and Lawrence of Arabia. It also spawned an entertaining sequel in 1989. Enjoy!",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Lived up to the hype,"I missed out on watching this as a child, when most of my friends saw it. They all loved it, so I was a bit wary of watching it in case it wasn't as good as they said.  This is what usually happens.  Well - it was great, frankly!I think Bill Murray is brilliant, which may have prejudiced me slightly. I have seen him in things I've hated though, so I can recognise them, but he was fantastic in this.  And so was everyone else.  Ernie Hudson was a bit underused, but no complaints otherwise.  Even the special effects (though slightly dated) were impressive.  It was atmospheric, funny, clever, and just a great experience.I'd recommend it to anyone of any age.  I think I may have enjoyed it even more when I was younger, but probably not much!  It was exactly as good as I thought it was going to be, which was very good indeed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Unremarkable,"Just watched this movie after having it hyped by all my friends "" You have to see ghost busters!"" ""You gotta see ghost busters!"". And I have to say what I got was a major disappointment. In fact I believe it to be highly over rated.For one thing, none of the characters had any depth. They either spewed one liners like they had a fatal disease, explained the plot, or were sex objects.SPEAKING OF SEX OBJECTS; This movie is quite sexist. There are two main female characters in this film ,neither of whose names I can remember, ( I watched this half an hour ago) one of whom is pining for one of the male leads, the other who is possessed and gets turned into a sexy goddess dog... Thing.And just too add to that, ghost busters isn't that... Well, funny. I think I laughed out once in this movie, and that was the first scene where Bill Muray's character is attempting to seduce some woman through his weird physic test... Something . ( I don't really know, it's never explained that well) The rest of it was unfunny one liners or bad situational comedy.But Ghostbusters worst crime is that it's just kinda... Boring. The plot is unremarkable end of the world stuff with a dumb Bill Murray's character trying to seduce Sigourney Weaver's character subplot thrown in there too.So in the end, if you like this movie, by all means, go ahead like it! Who am I to stop you? But personally, I thought it to be incredibly unremarkable. Not bad, just unremarkable(For the record, I love all the actors in this movie. Just not in this)",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Brilliant fun and fresh comedy,"Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson are the Ghostbusters, a team of para-psychologists that setup an emergency service for people experiencing problems with irritating transients from the spirit world.The impact of this film is still awesome even now, it's quite simply a great idea that is brought to the big screen by the talented writing of Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis. Using wonderful special effects (for the time) and the comic genius of themselves plus Bill Murray, they produced a film that is one of the most memorable comedies in movie history.This film is littered with hilarious gags and funny scenes, that are all housed within the solid and very inventive storyline.8/10 It's great",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Pretty entertaining... not fantastic though,"Ghostbusters is a classic 1980s film that everyone has at least heard of, especially because of the 2016 remake starring Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig. The original movie stars Bill Murray, Sigourney Weaver, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, and Harold Ramis. It is a comedy movie, the only people that ever think this is a scary movie are small children. The movie is all about these men who form a group and of course they go into the business of ghost busting together. The writing is very comical, it's really not the best comedy in the world, but parts of it are funny. To be honest, I like this movie mainly because of the cast, big Sigourney Weaver fan. The effects were good for the time, now they'd kinda be lacking. The action scenes are done pretty well and I liked the visuals. The movie is one most people will have fun with, it's just not the greatest thing in the world if I'm being 100% honest. I give ghostbusters a 7/10 because it is pretty entertaining, but it is not the best movie in the world.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"A blend of comedy, horror and special effects that go together very well","Ghostbusters came out in the summer of 1984 just before I was born and would later be a fan of the film along with its products as I got older with age.The film's premise involves three scientist at a local college in New York where they get kicked out due to lack of funding and poor judgment. The leader of the trio is Dr. Peter Venkman (cool performance by Bill Murray) who not only experiments with people as part of his project, but if it's a seducing woman then Peter would do his best to get the girl. His life is basically sex, money and rock and roll while his two associates Dr. Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd delivering major punchlines) a free-spirited scientist that loves his work around the paranormal and Dr. Egon Spangler (Harold Ramis) a no non-sense scientist take their work serious and need to do something once they get kicked out of school. Peter decides that with their knowledge they could open up a business of getting rid of the paranormal after encountering a ghost in the library.Somehow things don't go well until the three members (who are known as Ghostbusters) meet a woman by the name of Dana Barrett (Sigorney Weaver of ""Alien"" fame) who believes that her apartment is haunted after getting notice from a neighbor that her TV was turned on loud and didn't even know about it along with seeing a creature inside her refrigerator. Peter has taken interest in Dana Barrett while seeing that nothing is wrong in her apartment just before getting called into action as the Ghostbusters take their first job before being famous. With so much ghosts in the area of New York they hire Winston Zeddmore (Ernie Hudson) before more things come in their way from a pesky environmental agent (William Atherton) who wants to shut down the good guys while Dana and her neighbor Louis Tully (Rick Moranis) get attacked by the spirits in the apartment where later all havoc breaks loose and it's up to the Ghostbusters to save the day.""Ghostbusters"" has three things that made the film successful: comedy, a spooky element and a special effects movie where they all work without letting the audience down. Bill Murray is classic where most of his lines will be forever be quoted by fans while at the same time blends comedy in the first act of the film while being serious in the second act when things get out of hand. Aykroyd and Ramis, who wrote the script, make sure they can write a comedy without losing the audience and be subtle at the same time with certain scenes. The spooky parts involving the monsters will more or less likely scare kids away while the special effects will have you begging for more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Armed with ectoplasmic swats and the patented booby traps, they walk a fine line between scientific genius and lunacy in their quest to rid the city of these slimy, haunting monsters.This film starred: Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd & Sigourney Weaver.In my opinion this is a smart and funny film, It's got some very humorous scenes and a great film to watch on a Sunday afternoon with the family and the children. I recommend this film to anybody who likes family comedies or just plain and simple Bill Murray fans.***/***** Good film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
awful,"I remember not liking this movie as a kid (but all my friends liked it). I have several adult friends who can recite lines from this movie. So I watched it again recently. I can't believe how strongly I disliked it. I actually tuned it out halfway through, and read books/magazines while it played, then paid attention again during the final scene which I had specifically remembered from childhood.There are no likable characters in this movie, with the possible exception of Louis (Rick Morannis) , who I found endearing. My biggest problem with the movie was Bill Murray's character. I think his character was trying to be funny. Maybe? My reaction to Murray's character was to intensely want to punch him in the face. Why didn't Sigourney Weaver punch him in the face? I don't know. Why didn't the overworked secretary (Janine) punch him in the face? I don't know. Why didn't his colleagues, the EPA guy, the list goes on and on, Bill Murray was a jack-a$$ who mocked everyone in the movie, yet inexplicably, everyone puts up with it.A lot of people will dislike this review, because perhaps they really liked Murray's character. That's fine. But he wasn't funny, and he was a &^%#@ the whole movie. And the movie revolves around him.There was one line, ""When someone asks you if you're a god, you say YES!"" That made my lip curl up, in the closest thing to a smile that the movie made me produce. This line was not delivered by Bill Murray.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Who ya gonna call? Ghostbusters!,"For it's time, Ghostbusters would have to be a classic. Visiting such realms as the supernatural, is sure not meant to be funny, but this film does stretch that rule a little. Thankfully it does, as it allows those among us (like me), who do not believe in ghost and goblins, to sit back, relax and enjoy the funny antics of these ghost-busting heroes. Although it might be a little dated in the new millennium, 'Ghostbusters' is still one of the 'great comedies of the 1980's' in my view.When the University downsizes the parapsychology department, Doctors Venkman, Stantz and Spengler make the leap from scientists to Ghostbusters, investigators and exterminators of paranormal pests! When the bewitching Dana Barrett discovers her refrigerator has become a portal into the spiritual dimension, our heroes come face to face with an ancient evil force with plans to raise hell in Manhattan.When reviewing a movie, I try to be as fair as I can be. However I feel that by only viewing a movie once, we can not comprehend or appreciate the work that has gone into it, as a lot of work goes into bringing a movie to 'life'. For me that is no more apparent than with this classic hit. The time spent doing the script, special effects, production designs all have their merit and make this movie great. It is not just actors doing their job, as that is only one small part of the movie.Most of 'Ghostbusters' success must be given to director Ivan Reitman. He did a fabulous job directing the Ghostbusters. I am certain that he left no stone unturned when it came to getting this film right and I am so glad he did. What also made this film more unique was that two of its stars wrote one very very good script. I am of course talking about Dan Akroyd and Harold Ramis. Their originality and comedy on paper, made watching this film a real joy. It is not often that stars write good scripts, but this time these guys got it right.The cast that this film has was amazing to say the least. The four Ghostbuster characters were all different, which made them great to watch. I love the way that director Reitman summed up the Ghostbusters. He said of the three main guys that, Bill Murray was the 'mouth' or the smart ass of the film, while Dana Barrett says of Dr Venkman, ' you're more like a game-show host' and I have to agree with that, Dan Akroyd was the 'hands', meaning the person who was very hands-on when came to the ghostbusting, and finally Harold Ramis was the 'Brains' or the smartest one of Ghostbusters. Add in the cheery Ernie Hudson, who played Winston Zeddemore, making them the perfect team.However, the Ghostbusters are a little different when it comes to doing their job. They have funny facilities, which only they could invent, a car that is as wild and conspicuous as its owners are, while the tools that they use to trap there supernatural phenomenon are weird and crazy. I love the traps, 'nuclear accelerators' and other bits and pieces they simply refer to as 'toys', when they are anything but that.Then take into consideration the other great roles in this film, as without them this film would not be as good. Sigourney Weaver was very 'spiritual' when came to being the normally delightful Dana Barrett. I really enjoyed the onscreen chemistry between her and Bill Murray. Rick Moranis played the moronic '' as only he can. I always think of him as the man from 'Little shop of horrors', but there is no doubting his acting talents. Add in the very 'unusual' and eccentric Receptionist Janine, who was amusingly portrayed by Annie Potts. I love it when she screams 'we got one'. Yet I still say my favourite character in the Ghostbusters, over the silly Venkman (who is second), is the funny ghost Slimer. While Murray is as insane as the ghosts were in this movie, Slimer steals the show in my view. He is wild, 'slimes' people and makes the Ghostbusters all the funnier. Whoever invented Slimer is a genius!There are some very funny scenes and lines in this movie. I love how we are introduced to the first ghost in the movie, who is part of the library in New York, then the mayhem and chaos we see slimmer cause in the Hotel is classic cinematography. The Venkman line at the end of the scene is priceless as he says 'we came, we saw, we kicked its ass!' Throw in scenes with the monsters that run around New York terrorising people, the unlocking of ghosts by the Environmental Protection jerk and the Marshmallow Man are all hilarious parts to a movie that is full on from start to the finish.I wish I had been old enough to see the opening of 'Ghostbusters' in the cinema, as I am sure it would have had a huge cinema release. When I remember the Ghostbusters two things come to mind. One is the hypnotic tune 'Ghostbusters' written and performed by Ray Parker Jnr., and two is that my mother and one of her friends said that they banned their children from viewing such rot. I certainly missed out on seeing many great facets of what the Ghostbusters spawned, such as two ingenious cartoons. I sort of understand what they were on about, but I would have preferred being allowed to watch it and then just forget about it. This film has a lot to like about, it is funny, crazy and a little bit different. If you are yet to see what the great fuss is about the 'Ghostbusters', then please do yourself a favour and pick up a copy today. Yes, they are ready to believe you!CMRS gives 'Ghostbusters': 5 (Brilliant Film)",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
The Greatest Movie Ever,"Ghostbusters is by far the greatest movie in the history of modern cinema. It may seem corny at first, but in order to really appreciate it you have to watch it a few times.  Or a couple hundred, like me.  Bill Murray is great, providing the obvious jokes and sarcastic comments.  Dan Akyroid is great as well, but I think that Harold Ramis is the best in Ghostbusters.  You have to watch him and pay attention to what he says, or else you'll end up missing the funniest (yet most subtle) moments.  Add straight guy Ernie Hudson and 80s big time hottie Sigourney Weaver to the mix, and this cast is awesome.  The scene in the mayor's office........priceless.  Listening to Murray call the EPA guy Pecker instead of his real name Peck, wow.  ""Yes it's true.....this man has no dick.""  The funniest line in any movie ever, no matter how childish you may think it is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Good spirits,"For years my wife has quoted phrases from this movie at me, such as ""Don't give me those bug-eyes Janine!"", to ""Are you a god?, No, then die!"" and ""It just popped in there"", so, with only this and my liking of the sprightly theme song by Ray Parker Jr to go on, I finally tuned in to watch it. The thing is too, that I usually bypass most popular culture from the 80's (the decade that taste forgot), for instance I've never watched ""Ghost"", ""Dirty Dancing"", ""Top Gun"" or ""E.T."" and won't be rushing to in the near future, there are far too many earlier movies I've still to see. But hey, I really enjoyed this unusual mix of frat comedy and supernatural / science fiction thrills.I liked the three amigo scientists right away, the womanising Bill Murray, earnest Dan Ayckroyd and professorial Ivan Reitman. Sigourney Weaver adds the sexiness (eventually) and Rick Moranis outdoes the three busters in geekiness as Weaver's lovelorn neighbour. The natural landscape of New York is effectively blended in, the special effects are fine for their day and the script delivers excitement and humour in equal measure.Not every idea from the Saturday Night Live team hit the jackpot but this one certainly deserved to, helped by an offbeat idea with broad appeal, a good script and a nice story arc which not only delivers a big finish but also sees Murray get the girl.Call again!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
A Comedy Classic?,"Almost, the 1984 Blockbuster can now be considered a comedy classic. 20 years later, the move that was way before its time is still a delight for any audience. Many horror comedies fall short and can't find an audience. Ghost Busters is an original idea that wasn't too unique to make millions at the box office. Bill Murray adds to the genius of the movie as a modern day Charlie Chaplin with addition to slap stick and Flip Wilson humor. Aykroyd, Ramis, and Moranis complete the wild comedy that makes up Ghost Busters. While remaining to be somewhat serious, the film throws a series of jokes, gags and innocent humor that isn't found in many movies. Weaver had never been sexier whether she was fighting ghosts or aliens. A comedy that stands alone, Ghost Busters is great",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Originally, John Candy was to play the role as a conservative business type. I think that would have bombed. Moranis's version of Tully was perfect. A low point in the movie was Sigourney Weaver. She is much better at fighting aliens. This movie definitely brings me back to my childhood. I never could figure out the Slimer character. When I see him I say, ""Hey, Look it's a ghost.""

The Natural Artificial,"Some movies come with a surrounding story that makes it a richer experience.This one's enriching story is that it is largely accidental. They had a different movie in mind, then changed it in a rush, making changes and inventing every day while shooting. Usually this results in an incoherent mess, but in this case it became ever so MORE coherent.The reason is that all the principles are strongest at improvisational comedy. And they had worked together intensively and knew how to make each other look good. Its a funny thing about acting, especially comedic acting in the long form : you almost never can actually make yourself a success. You have to trust your partners to make you a success.I always enjoy this movie. Like ""Holy Grail"" its charm is in referencing a mature world of slightly twisted forces, keeping some constant. Its a familiar place, naturally found. Its that natural access that makes it so endearing. Nothing is forced; no one is trying very hard.

I Ain't 'Fraid of No Ghost,"""Dr. Peter Vinkman"" (Bill Murray) is a professor of parapsychology who really doesn't believe in any of the subject matter within his field but is more than happy to live off of the grants provided to his team for research. However, when the grant is taken away he soon finds himself out on the street with his colleagues looking for a way to survive. As luck would have it, when a real apparition is reported to be in a nearby library he soon becomes convinced and along with his colleagues, ""Dr. Raymond Stantz"" (Dan Aykroid) and ""Dr. Egon Spengler"" (Harold Ramis) sets up a team known as ""Ghostbusters"" to make some money. What he doesn't know is that a supernatural event is about to happen which will elevate his status beyond anything he ever anticipated. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a very popular film when it first came out and even though it has since lost some of its initial appeal still remains a solid comedy today.

A childhood classic that is still enjoyable,"I first saw Ghostbusters when I was 8 years old after watching the cartoon The Real Ghostbusters during Saturday morning cartoons when I was younger. The movie is still a delight to watch after many years, and the comedy and special effects are still enjoyable. Who would have thought the Ghostbusters symbol would still be popular after many years, particularly on many t-shirts.Take away the comedic elements and Ghostbusters would not be the same. It is due to the efforts of Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, Harold Ramis and Rick Moranis that makes it possible and has created one of the most popular comedies of all time. Bill Murray's deadpan delivery of his many humorous and sarcastic one liners are still a classic.The movie starts with the discovery of apparent paranormal activities and the three scientists Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Raymond Stanz (Dan Ackroyd), and Egon Spengler (the late Harold Ramis) are called in to investigate. After losing their jobs at Columbia University the three decide to start up a ghost busting company specialising in capturing ghosts. Although business is slow at first, the Ghostbusters make their mark in New York after their first call in which they capture their first ghost in the Sedgewick Hotel and their business is in high demand across New York. The Ghostbusters also enlist a fourth member to join their team Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson).The Ghostbusters are later called to investigate the apartment Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) lives in after she finds that her apartment is haunted by the demonic spirit Zuul. Venkman finds himself immediately attracted to Dana Barrett and also takes a keen interest in investigating this further. Dana has to also contend with her neighbour, the nerdy accountant Louis Tully (Rick Moranis) who Dana constantly but politely rebuffs.The Ghostbusters future is almost put in jeopardy when a hard-nosed lawyer representing the EPA Walter Peck (William Atherton) orders the business shut down following breaches of the environmental act as well as inadvertently releasing all the ghosts captured to wreak havoc across New York. He also orders all four of the Ghostbusters arrested and thrown in jail.

Dan Ackroyd and Harold Ramis also counter balance the movie with their unique humour.Ghostbusters is certainly Ivan Reitman's finest movie and Dan Ackroyd and Harold Ramis prove they are not just a pretty face as they are responsible for writing the movie. Harold Ramis also proves that he is a good director, as evidenced by Groundhog Day.There's no doubting that Ghostbusters is still an enjoyable special effects bonanza and a great comedy.

An undeserved reputation as a classic.,"Some people have those favourite films as a child, something they sat, watching in front of the TV while playing with their Rubik's Cube or eating their Gummi Bears. Precious memories are made of such things. This is not one of mine.Yes, it has a great theme tune, and okay, the special effect were revolutionary for the time. But another viewing confirmed what I thought back when I was a wee sprog: The plot is a mess... Amongst other such nonsense, Sigourney Weaver and Rick Moranis turn into giant dog statues, and this is supposed to bring about the apocalypse. I thought as a young 'un I could write a better screenplay... And I still do.It also tries too hard to be amusing, with only Bill Murray's deadpan delivery providing a few chuckles... Everything else is just desperate banter. Other 'highlights', like the giant Stay Puft marshmallow guy going on a rampage, are just gimmicks designed to distract us from the lacklustre action. If only more people would take off their rose-tinted glasses, they'd be able to see this for what it really is: An average time-waster.It could be worse, though.

Classic 80's film... Rating is Nostalgically driven..,"Let me set the perfectly assembled cast aside... let me set the effects aside... And concentrate on how Ivan Reitman orchestrated the tale of three reject paranormal investigators and an unemployed desperate man whom decide to make a business saving humanity from ghosts in the great style of common pest exterminators. One of the aspects that makes this genius is how the film brands itself all while the loony entrepreneurs brand there business with an annoyingly catchy Ghostbusters song, old hertz turned company vehicle and the old fire station turned into ghost headquarters. Add to the mix their first and most important client played by Sigourney Weaver whom questions her sanity not because of the ghosts she sees in her Manhattan flat but because she decided to employ these silly men whom call themselves Ghostbusters..Lets say this was a film fitted for its time and that is that.

fresh and funny,"Wacky, off-the-wall scare comedy about three quirky paranormal scientists who are on the verge of bankruptcy after they lose their university grants. They go into business for themselves by tracking and exterminating supernatural spirits all over New York City, and unexpectedly turn into an overnight sensation. As with most lucrative business endeavors, they're forced to deal with lawsuits, scheduling conflicts, public criticism, and worst of all the forthcoming of a dreadful and potent evil.

an 80s classic fun-raiser,"My belated visit to the 80s classic ultra-popular American supernatural comedy directed by Ivan Reitman, indisputably his most successful directorial work to date, the Hollywood veteran is now in the inevitable course of being eclipsed by his son Jason Reitman, who is already a two-times Oscar-nominated director (JUNO 2007, 8/10 and UP IN THE AIR 2009, 7/10).The film stars Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis as a trio of nerdy parapsychologists in New York, after being dismissed by the university, they initiate a service knows as Ghostbusters to deal with the more and more frequent paranormal activities in the city, things then trace back to Gozer, a Sumerian amorphous god of destruction, who is going to wreck havoc on the city, with the aids of its two servants, Zuul the Gatekeeper and Vinz Clortho, the Keymaster, two ferocious dog- shaped demigods.The core trio (later joined by Ernie Hudson as the fourth member to appear politically corrected) predates the current trend of brain-is-the-new-sexy, Peter Venkman (Murray) more or less is a philanderer and particularly disarming in his aloof attitude to the gravitas of their cause. Raymond Stantz (Aykroyd) has a more guileless mindset, a man-boy hybrid will lovably bring about a beast of a giant marshmallow man. Egon Spengler (the late Ramis) is the geek among geeks, a stern-looking scientists with fully-functional apparatus to bust some ghosts. Peter's new love interest is Dana (Weaver), their first client soon to be possessed by Zuul, so is her neighbor Louis Tully (Moranis), as the receptacle of the Keymaster.The special effects are very much 1980s, but they are also the brainchild of a genuinely extraordinary creation, massively uproarious in its pokerface seriousness (not to mention its contagious theme song by Ray Parker Jr. The wacky script written by Aykroyd and Hamis is the mainstay of its distinctiveness, Murray's iconic personification of his on-screen image is droll to watch, Weaver is beguilingly titillating after the possession and Moranis's loquacious improvisation slightly overstays its welcome, but appropriately dovetails itself into the demigod.Very rarely a comedy can blend well with its spectral fodder and family-friendly closeness, GHOSTBUSTERS is far from being a perfectly executed masterpiece, or a cutting-edge cinematic pioneer, but its common-or-garden stance effectively boosts the ""everyone can be a hero"" message, no wonder it has been an enormous crowd-pleaser and bred into a beloved franchise since the inception. I may skip its 1989 sequel but a long-delayed third installment doesn't seem to a bad idea at all, or the latest rumor is the BRIDESMAIDS (2011, 7/10) helmer Paul Feig is eying for an all-female reboot, it sounds much more enticing, Bill Murray even gives his own suggestion of the casting, see here",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

It's Murray's Party,"""Ghostbusters"" has a place in our heart because it's silly entertainment, the kind that we looked forward to seeing when we were children. We loved ghosts stories and special effects that scared us just enough, nothing with gore and slashers. Just an old fashioned time when we had fun looking at ectoplasm and enjoying the heroes' adventures when they tried to solve the problem. It was comedy with special effects, and ""Ghostbusters"" works for the most part.Yes, the effects are a bit cheesy. Maybe they're meant to be that way, and it's got an innocent feel to it. The ultimate monster is a marshmallow man that will destroy civilization as we know it. One's worst fate is to be slimed or turned into a dog, and it's a lot of fun most of the time, but it could have used more Bill Murray and more editing to give us a better experience.Most of the joy is seeing all that talent in the screen. Bill Murray's dry approach is just a delight. Everything from his one-liners, his gestures, and his exchanges with Sigourney Weaver who is truly a sport while sparring with him, growing to like him as the film progresses, and Rick Moranis plays his nerdy part so well, it's hard not to start laughing every time he jumps in the scene. Everyone else does well, but the three standouts are the ones mentioned before.NYC is threatened by a surge in supernatural activity, and soon references such as the key master are thrown around. It's all very simple. People are possessed, bureaucracy makes mistakes and our heroes get to save the world. One goes to see the film to have a good time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

My sister had seen it, my friends had seen it, i'd seen the music video...I HAD TO SEE THIS FILM!It looked like the film would leave the cinemas before I got my chance to see it, when one night after a visit to a restaurant with my family we walked past the beauty that is the Holloway Odeon.'Do you wanna see Ghostbusters?' asked my dad. He didn't need to hear the response. Would we make it in time for the last screening? Yes! We were actually allowed to go in whilst the preceding screeing was playing. It had already got up to the Ecto on the Brooklyn Bridge shot by then. We watched it all from there, and then watched the entire film again from the beginning. I was seven years old and that was the moment I fell in love with cinema.The comedy/horror ever? Maybe (though American Werewolf In London comes close too). Certainly the most successful.

One of those cases which big expectations can turn into a disappointment,"""Ghost Busters"" is an okay film, but not all that potato bag for me. In fact, I think it tends to be overrated and a little too overvalued. If you ask me, people tend to give this movie more credit than it deserves. But I respect other people's opinions, even if I disagree with them.""Ghost Busters"" is reasonably entertaining on its whole. The first half, without being spectacular, is nevertheless entertaining, fun and has its moments of comedy. In the second half, the movie becomes extremely dark (with all those monsters and strange creatures), losing interest for me (although that giant Marshmallow Man is a curious figure).In fact, those hideous creatures that appear in the second half, that wizard-like woman and some very disturbing ghosts are mostly what ruins the movie for me.However, not everything is bad about this movie. It has a delightful soundtrack theme which is a classic: the song ""Ghostbusters"", performed by Ray Parker Jr. What else? The special effects are, most of them, awesome (typically 80's, which is a good thing). And finally: both Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd are quite funny in these roles. Bill Murray has a very particular sense of humor. Dan Aykroyd, on the other hand, is an actor which I've always seen playing serious and sometimes grumpy characters, so I never expected to see him in a comical role like this. But in ""Ghost Busters"" he's quite funny and he does some hilarious facial expressions.Rick Moranis is cool as Louis Tully, but I honestly rather him as Wayne Szalinski in ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"".Conclusion? It's not a boring movie, a bad movie or a big quality movie. Overall, it's just an okay movie made mainly for some fun and entertainment. «Who you gonna call? Ghostbusters!» My rating is a 6/10. I think it's a fair and deserved rating for this movie: neither more neither less than that.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

This isn't a film. It's a successful marketing project.,"Ghostbusters is a clear example of the good work of marketing that surrounds cinema. All the popularity that formed the reputation of this film is clearly due to publicity work since the movie itself is quite mediocre.It contains a high amount of humor that doesn't really go down well, it's quite cheesy in the comedy it has. The script is at least strange because things happen without explanation or that should not happen, for example that the ghostbusters run their own business while being financially bankrupt, and so on with a lot of conveniences that only happen for the good of the show that doesn't end up being something that surprising either. The characters are flat, no arcs, nothing. They don't understand between each other and neither the audience.Visual effects are a mix of many techniques. Unfortunately they don't look good. The production design fails in this sense because the creatures are quite unconvincingly ugly and their movements are not consistent with the physics of the real world. Even the visual effects of lightning, fire and explosions seemed to be hastily done without achieving a realistic but rather cartoonish aesthetic.The acting is mediocre, the editing is bad, the photography is decent, the direction is austere.I don't understand how such a mediocre film could become so popular to the point of having another sequel 40 years later.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

"""I'm terrified beyond the capacity for rational thought.""","Somewhat overrated horror/ comedy, about a trio of paranormal investigators who set up shop just before the floodgates of Hell are opened, and Manhattan is overrun with ghosts and goblins and drooling, slobbering, flying green globs of ectoplasm.The first two thirds are amusing, while the final third is an odd mix of horror, psychobabble, and poorly dated effects work.

A comedy classic,"My daughter was flipping channels the other day and ran across the great 1984 Supernatural comedy GHOSTBUSTERS and stopped to watch for awhile. As happens with her generation, she eventually got more interested in her phone and friends and wandered away. Me? I was drawn back into this film so much so that I went downstairs, grabbed the DVD (yes, kids, I still own DVDs) and popped the film into my Home Theater System to give it a proper viewing.I gotta say...I was so inspired by how terrific this film is that I changed course and devoted the 23rd BankofMarquis Movies podcast to this film.Starring the comedic trio of Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis and featuring Sigourney Weaver, Ernie Hudson and the great Rick Moranis, GHOSTBUSTERS tells the tale of supernatural exterminators called to save NYC when paranormal experiences start escalating in the Big Apple.But it's not the destination, it's the journey that makes this film so much fun. Told in a standard 2 Act arc - Origin Story followed by a 2nd Act of battling the ""Big Bad"" - it is the comedic timing and chemistry of the 3 leads that makes this film work (aided by a wonderful ""straight man"" turn by Sigourney Weaver and a brilliant ""side-kick"" comedic turn by Rick Moranis).Credit for keeping this film together, moving and more than just a ""series of jokes"" is Director Ivan Reitman (STRIPES, MEATBALLS), he had the comedic ""cred"" to appeal to these 3 big time comedians, but has a Producers sense of efficiency and a Director's command of subject and tone.This film was Aykroyd's idea and he shines as, Ray Stantz, the heart of the Ghostbusters. He truly believes in what he is doing and has a child-like sense of wonder in his actions. Harold Ramis (more noted as a Writer and a Director) was brought in to co-write Aykroyd's idea, steering it more towards Reitman's idea of humor and writing in a way that would make Murray shine - but he is also wonderfully deadpan as techno-geek Egon Spengler. The serious nerd who never smiles.But...make no mistake...this film revolves around the antics of con-man Dr. Peter Venkman, a scientist who doesn't believe any of this, but is willing to go along as long as it achieves his goals. And...what are his goals? Well...womanizing and getting through life with as little work as possible. Murray is at the top of his comedic game in this film and most of his scenes are improvised - but, to be fair to the writers, Murrya's riffs are what Ramos and Aykroyd put down on paper. He is the mouth of this film and his energy drives this movie throughout.Sigourney Weaver proved that she could do more than Sci-Fi action (like ALIEN) when she plays the straightman to these 3 wild-men. She stated that she was channeling her inner Margaret Dumont (straightman to the Marx Brothers) and she does an admirable, charming job in a role that could have easily come off as annoying.Rick Moranis, of course, almost steals the film as the nerdy accountant neighbor of Weaver's. His improvised riff as he goes around the room at his own party is the stuff of comedic gold.Ernie Hudson comes along as the 4th Ghostbuster. Many folks thinks that he is the ""unnecessary"" GhostBuster, but I would argue that he comes along at a time (right after the origin story is complete) to be the audience surrogate - to ask the questions that need to be asked and to get necessary expository passages out.And...finallly...there is William Atherton as EPA Agent Walter Peck. I kind of feel sorry for this actor, for he had a decent career going up to Ghostbusters, but he was so good as the annoying, buzzkill ""anti-Ghostbuster"" that serves as the foil for their antics, that he wasn't really accepted in any other kind of role the rest of his career (he would play a version of this character in the first 2 DIE HARD films).The special effects hold up, just enough to make them passable. Keep in mind that this film was made over 35 years ago and the effects were state of the art back in the day, so I would recommend you cut that some slack.And...if you do...you'll be rewarded with a rollicking fun time at the movies.Letter Grade: A9 stars (out of 10) and you can that to the Bank(OfMarquis)",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Childhood favourite and all-time classic,"GHOSTBUSTERS was one of my favourite films as a kid; I first saw it when I was about 5, and it scared the hell out of me (that librarian ghost - jeez!). My old VHS tape was worn through by the time I grew up and forgot about it. Now, years later, I decided to give it another spin and discover whether it was one of those films that holds up even when you're an adult...The answer is a resounding YES! GHOSTBUSTERS is still a great movie, a thoroughly entertaining classic for all ages. It's an out-and-out comedy featuring my favourite performance from a beautifully deadpan Bill Murray, who's perfectly supposed by Dan Ackroyd (who makes a great butt for the jokes), Harold Ramis (as the straight guy), Ernie Hudson (underrated), Sigourney Weaver (a delightful role reversal from Ellen Ripley) and little Rick Moranis, who's always hilarious.Although the film was made nearly 30 years ago, it hasn't dated in the slightest and the detectives vs. spooks storyline still holds up really well. I just can't get over how well made it is, with scenes that should be ridiculous (such as the climax) just totally gathering you up and immersing you in the experience. I love the Lovecraftian undertones, and the way the special effects are still much, much better than most of the CGI in modern movies. Those stop motion dog-creatures, absolutely fantastic, even now.Okay, so the sequel wasn't so great, but I'm a firm believer in the fact that no matter how many bad sequels or remakes, you can never spoil the entertainment value of a classic movie. And GHOSTBUSTERS is exactly that: a classic for all ages, a genuine family movie that never panders to a young audience and remains timeless because of it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Who you gonna call?...Ghostbusters!,"Ghostbusters is quite simply one of my most beloved films of all time. The iconic production is a perfect marriage of a special effects extravaganza with spectacular performances to create one side- splitting gem. Bill Murray is the undeniable star and he's in top form as Dr. Peter Venkman a sly, laid back scientist with deadpan delivery that seems more concerned with dating his pretty client Dana Barrett than actually getting to the bottom of her disturbances. Sigourney Weaver nicely straddles the line between exasperated annoyance and charmed love interest. Bill Murray likewise has great camaraderie with his fellow Ghostbusters Dr. Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) and Dr. Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis). Those two are also responsible for writing the finely tuned screenplay. It zips, it pops and it never lets up. Ernie Hudson joins them later as Winston Zeddemore. He delivers my favorite quip after the group is blown away by the lightening bolts of an evil entity from another dimension. There is a slew of funny dialogue and Rick Moranis' nerdy portrayal of Louis Tully delivers a lot of it. He's hilarious. ""Okay, who brought the dog?"" he grins after hearing the growl from the long horned beast hiding in his closet. The spectacular special effects support the story, but they never threaten to overshadow the actors. The technology was state of the art at the time, even earning an Academy Award nomination. But it lost to the mine cart scene in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Perhaps time has rendered the optics a bit quaint to a modern audience. The sight of that devil dog leaping from the closet and running around the city is the most dicey. But it's the comedic interactions between characters that hold our focus, not the whiz bang appeal of the visual displays. OK so there's that ""monster"" near the end that dwarfs everything else. When the Destructor of their choosing threatens the city and their very existence, it's memorable. That's the kind of silly moment of brilliance that make you realize you're watching a work of creative genius. Oh yeah. I adore this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

An icon of the eighties still winning public today,"In this film, the protagonists are four paranormal fanatics who decide to join forces and create a company specialized in removing ghosts of New Yorker's houses. The boss is Dr. Peter Venkman (played by Bill Murray), an parapsychologist little crazy and deeply sarcastic. He's assisted by Dr. Egon Spengler (embodied by Harold Ramis), the intellectual genius of the quartet, Dr. Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) and Winston Zeddmore (played by Ernie Hudson). In this film, they have to win Gozer, a demonic entity that will try to use Dana (Sigourney Weaver), a girl who Venkman tried to conquer, to achieve it's dark aim of destroying the world.We're facing, probably, one of the most iconic comedies of the eighties. Bill Murray, who could already consider himself an experienced comedy actor, reached an exceptional level, dominating this movie and toasting the audience with deeply ironic and irresistible laughing moments. The result was Murray's launch to stardom, as one of the best comedians of the eighties cinema. Another actor that was highlighted was Rick Moranis, who plays Mr. Tully, one of the funniest characters in this film thanks to Moranis enormous talent. The film has a number of very good special effects, probably the best of his time, a time when special effects knew how to be in a movie without dominating it. The soundtrack is also a very positive aspect of this movie, with the ""Ghostbuster's"" song topping the Billboard Hot 100. This song is still known to the general public presently.This film should be one of the comedies that more money earned over during the eighties. And it's not difficult to understand why: it's a movie for everyone and appeals to children the same way as the elderly.

The movie is really a series of hilarious encounters among the characters and their effort to rid New York City of the threat. Bill Murray is the wise cracking leader of the group with sidekick Dan Aykroyd following suit. Sigourney Weaver supplies the female interest and then there are the amazing special effects.

"Confident, often brash, depiction of thriving corporatism; punishable atheism and a hybrid of new means to defeat old beliefs in a soufflé of comedy and horror.","I suppose there is an idea at the core of Ghostbusters somewhere; a high-concept film, about a group of people essentially adopting the role of contemporary exorcists, that straddles some sort of often vacant place on a line that separates non-reality with what could feasibly happen if you were religious. It is a curious thing when a text attempts to handle that of demons, ghouls and ghosts. Deep down, I suppose, it is somewhat perversely pleasurable to convince ourselves of their existence. As years have passed, germs have replaced the invisible monsters that-once-were as the cause for illness; technology has been able to deduce whether or not haunted locales truly are as such while science; theories on evolution and modernity in general has done 'wonders' to disprove the idea that religion and so forth are as genuine as everybody thought they were for so long.There was a line in the Tarantino-penned 1996 horror film ""From Dusk til Dawn"" when the anti-heroic lead states that ""if there is a Hell"", and that the monsters occupying an adjacent room ""are from it"", then there's ""got to be a Heaven"". Should the existence of ghosts, demons and whatnot run in tandem with the theory that there is a heaven and an afterlife? Probably, and yet in spite of all this sweeping modernity doing well to disprove the spirit world and the idea of an 'afterlife', there are still those who remain unconvinced of a ghost's inauthenticity; remain staunch that they've encountered one and remain adamant that the line between our world and the next not only exists, but is thinner than you think. One of the (admittedly, few) charms of the 1984 horror/comedy Ghostbusters is how it exploits the belief of that line while keeping everything as reigned in as it does. This is not, for the best part, an all-out horror film depicting nasty, invading spirits doing their utmost to invade a densely populated human locale, although it does descend into that by the end. Moreover, this is a clash of the old and the new; an unabashed depiction of hauntings and ghosts as very much real but a depiction of science and technology otherwise associated with disproving God; Heaven; Hell and reincarnation through spirit being used to counter said entities.New York City must be one of the most populated zones in the world, but does that mean there'd be more or fewer ghosts there than somewhere largely vacant, such as that attic in an old, isolated English manor house from centuries ago located somewhere in the countryside. Regardless, the leads therein the film discover a fair few of them merely going about their routines in a manner that is underplayed and quite funny but, one senses, realistic to the cause should a large uncovering of spirits ever unfold. Ivan Reitman's film mixes the audacious with the bubble-gum, a depicting people coming into contact with spiritual entities although sadly never really learning anything nor becoming more enriched as a result of it. While the film is quite good fun and often funny, it comes across as too superficial to be anything wonderfully inventive nor much more than frivolously academic. It's often quite childish, even dull in places. Admittedly, where not every film of its ilk can be as good as ""The Sixth Sense"", where the presence of ghosts in a characters life leads to an enriched bond with a psychologist, Ghostbusters does hit the odd mark.The film follows four New York City based men, two Caucasian; an African American and a Jew, who set up their own business in a disused fire station that specialises in ghostly phenomena. Initially, the men (still minus the African American) are ill-suited to the practical aspect of their work where the theory is all in the right place. Uncovering a poltergeist in a library archive, they can only run screaming for their lives when it turns uglier than they'd like. Buoyed by their experience, they have enough confidence to set up this business when a university cuts their funding and the enterprise turns into a ghost 'busting' organisation upon realising there's money in making the ghosts go away – a sort of supernatural pest exterminator. Among them is Bill Murray's psychologist Peter Venkman, a man whose womanising ways is evident in the opening and who remains largely sceptical on the whole library phenomena anyway where his partners do not. At the other end of the spectrum is Harold Ramis' Egon Spengler, a dry man and the most intelligent of the four who is too deep into his work to notice the affection shown towards him by their eventual receptionist. Somewhere in the middle is the ""funny-as-Murray"" but ""as-good-at-his-job-as-Ramis"" Dan Akroyd, who plays Raymond Stantz.Narrative is, of course, superfluous in a film like Ghostbusters; its end-of-the-world routine, as Sigorney Weaver's Dana Barrett discovers a gateway into a doom-laden alternate dimension, is as nonsensical as it gets in a film which might otherwise have been quite intelligently theological. The true pleasures lie in the film's would-be tryst involving the ever-humorous Venkman and the delight in the way he shares his scenes with Weaver, although we do not come to observe much closure to any of it – nor indeed do we Spengler's with the receptionist. The film is more interested in cracking on with its primary tract of special effects and unexplained alternative universes which, one assumes, comes complete with their own dynamic structures but the likes of which are not explored here. But it remains difficult to get angry with the film because it has with it a boyish energy; it does the rare thing for an American blockbuster in actually trying to sell to you this U.S.P. innocently and fondly, as if it cares for it so much and wants you to share in this fondness. In the ever declining cinematic world of 'event' movies within which we live, that alone is justification for checking Ghostbusters out.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"The Brave, The Best, The Only...Ghostbusters!","""Ghostbusters,"" is considered to be one of the greatest sci fi comedies of all time, and it has endured by many generations as they had grew up with this movie and still cherish it til this day. This movie was definetly a childhood of mine, as I watched this on an old VHS that was recorded on TV before having an actual copy of the movie; then it came to DVD, and now we have Blu Ray. Now I'm an adult, the question is: does it hold up? Well, here is my review. The movie is about these three scientist: Peter Venkman, Ray Stantz, and Egon Spengler as they all got fired from the university, so now all they have left is to start a business of their own by catching ghosts. Furthermore, we have Dana Barrett, who has a ghost problem as the building she lives in is being taken over by the evil Gozer as her minions known as the Terror Dogs to posses both Dana and her nerdy neighbor Louis Tully as they are about to bring the end of the world. Its up to our heroes to kick some ghost, and to save the world. Its as ridiculous as it may sound, but it works and definetly well executed. The movie's screenplay is written cleverly by both Dan Aykroyd and the late Harold Ramis, and they both have given great performances. Ernie Hudson, who plays Winston Zeddemore, doesn't show up into the second half of the movie but he does he give a good performance too. Sigourney Weaver and Rick Moranis are both excellent for the roles they were given to play. Annie Potts does fine for playing the secretary. William Atherton plays Walter Peck, as you really love to hate him. The villain Gozer is definetly a real threat, and really has a strong presence in this movie. As for Bill Murray, he is the man! He really steals the show, and his lines of dialogue are outstanding. Speaking of dialogue, the movie is definetly quotable for such great lines like ""Nice shootin' Tex,"" ""Nobody steps on a church in my town,"" ""He slimed me,"" and of course ""Back off man, I'm a scientist."" The movie itself is really funny, and all thanks to its cast as they know how to make the comedy work. Even Ivan Reitman's direction is really well done as he balance it really well for mixing both the comedy and horror elements into the movie. The movie does go at a very good pacing as it feels tighter, and doesn't drag too long. The ghosts in this movie are memorable as you have Slimer, Gozer, Terror Dogs, Librarian Ghost, Stay Puft, as well as the Dream Ghost which I'll get to. The gadgets as everyone remembers the PKE Meter, Ghost Trap, Ecto Goggles, and the Proton Packs. Cannot forget the Ectomobile! Elmer Bernstein's music is definetly one of his greatest scores, and does have a great soundtrack such as the theme song by Ray Parker Jr., ""Cleanin' Up The Town,"" ""Magic,"" and ""Savin' the Day."" The special effects may have some bad ones that don't age well, but for the most part, they are really good as this was all done practically without any use of CG at all. That is minor issue, but the major issue, which I am not a fan of is that dream scene where Ray has sex with a female ghost. I thought it was totally out of place, and should've been left on the cutting room floor. That is just my personal opinion. Nevertheless, ""Ghostbusters,"" is still a classic as it is funny, exciting, suspenseful, creative, and has a good heart. I am giving this movie a 9 out of 10!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Hilarious!,"One of the most genuinely hilarious comedies out there. The dialogue in itself makes me laugh every time I watch this movie, and on the DVD if you turn on the extras you will see how many things are adlibbed right then and there by the actors.Bill Murray undoubtedly delivers his stellar performance as Venkman, and Harold Ramis is perfect as Egon. They both have a wonderful deadpan manner, especially in a library scene very early on in the film.Dan Akyroyd is the naive mistake maker Ray Stanz, as his thoughts bring on the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, and Ernie Hudson rounds out the cast as Winston Zedmore, who is the last Ghostbuster to join up but is necessary.With Sigourney Weaver as Venkman's gorgeous love interest and Rick Moranis as her yuppie neighbor, this movie is a classic for anyone and definitely one of the best comedies EVER filmed!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Silly Fun,"This movie about three university professors of parapsychology who open their own ghost-hunting business after being turfed by the university isn't the greatest comedy I've ever come across. To be honest it isn't even close. But it is a fun little movie, if a little bit over-rated, featuring a solid cast and a good story.Everyone does a good job of treating the material seriously enough to make this funny, and pretty much everyone (with the possible exception of Rick Moranis) seems to be playing this ""straight."" I suppose one of the weaknesses I see with this movie is just that - everyone's too much of a ""straight man."" The end result was that I smiled a lot during the movie, and chuckled a few times, but never really burst out laughing at anything.The major stars (Bill Murray, Sigourney Weaver, Dan Aykroyd, etc.) all moved on to other projects over the ensuing years and, in my opinion, to better performances as well. If that sounds like a criticism, it really isn't. They were all fine in ""Ghostbusters."" It's just that I think their better performances were ahead of them. The one exception might be Moranis, who I mentioned earlier. He is very funny here as the geeky accountant Louis Tully, who is infatuated with Weaver's Dana Barrett, but is also frustrated that she doesn't return his feelings, until, of course, the two get together in the spirit world. Moranis, I think, did some of his best work here. Unfortunately, it was in a limited role.It's a pleasant movie to watch and there's nothing particularly wrong with it. It just didn't blow me away, which is why I give it a 5. In my view, it's a very average comedy.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
One of the best comedys ever made,"If there was one movie that perfectly mixes comedy and horror it would be Ghostbusters. It not only is one of the funniest movie I have ever seen, but when I was just a little kid, I was actually scared to watch it.If there are any problems they are small. Some of the effects haven't aged well, and there are a few jokes that don't work.But this movie is hilarious. Bill Murray, Harold Ramis, Dan Akroyd and Ernie Hudson are all perfect comedians. Put them together and you get comedy gold. Murray plays Venkman, a sarcastic wise ass. Ramis plays Egon, the intellectual one. Akroyd plays Ray, the guy who gets exited about everything. Hudson plays Winston, the cool guy who always knows the smart thing to do. And in terms of Rick Moranis as Louis Tully, just brilliant, and actresses Sigorney Weaver and Annie Potts are also good. It's also quite terryfying, the library ghost always made me afraid to look, and stay puft always made me leave the room when I was little.If you haven't seen this movie, go watch it now.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Who you gonna call?!,"Ghost Busters is one of those honest classics that will forever be remembered. It's one of those old wacky comedies that anyone could love. Not to mention it's unique idea of a story, while most ghost stories are supposed to be scary, Dan Aykroyd and Harrold Rammis made this into a genuine comedy that is so much fun to watch while it still has it's spooky moments here and there. They also picked the perfect cast and great characters, they clicked so well, and I think that's what made the story work so well. Not to mention one of the funnest songs of all time was made with this film, OK, a little off the subject, I know, but I had to mention it.Peter, Egon, and Ray are three unemployed fella's when they come up with a great idea. New York is being haunted by ghosts lately and no one can come up with a plan to get rid of them, well, instead of a typical exterminators, they become the Ghost Busters! The Ghost Busters are like the police only they know how to face these ghouls and they come up with a whole business with it. Peter's girlfriend, Dana, has a problem with her refrigerator, it has demons inside of it, not to mention the whole building is being taken over by evil forces that only the Ghost Busters can handle.Ghost Busters is a fun film that I guarantee you a few laughs with. This is a film that will be remembered for years to come. I think my favorite scene was when Louis Tully is having a party for the building and is trying so hard to get everyone to join, he was so cute. Not to mention when Dana becomes possessed and invites Peter over and how he handles the whole situation, it was just so funny.

The best comedy of our time,"I thought the original Ghostbusters was still and is still the best comedy/horror movie ever , even all these other spoof movies they did on horror movies can't compare to Ghostbusters ; Ghostbusters had the story , the direction and the cast which in my view , is still the best to date . Bill Murray is funny when he is uncontrollable just like he was in Groundhog Day as well , I think the top five comedians of our time have to be Charlie Chaplin , Bill Cosby and Mel Brooks , The Little Rascals ; sorry Three Stooges and the other comedy teams of that time , I always thought the Little Rascals or Our Gang were the best , and now Bill Murray , along with Dan Aykroyd , Rick Moranis , Harold Ramis and the ever beautiful Sigourney Weaver reminded me of an older version of the Little Rascals , they're very familiar . To bad Ghostbusters II did not succeed where the first did , can you imagine what they could have done if there was a Ghostbusters III movie or even a live action series , the possibilities were endless and still are .

Irrevocably '80s,"Packed with iconic lines, characters, props and costumes, Ghostbusters is a unmistakable film-turned-franchise firmly placed in people's nostalgic favourites.Although an '80s classic, a lot of what Ghostbusters does doesn't really work as a modern film. Whereas other sci-fi comedies such as Back To The Future feel timeless, Ghostbusters screams '80s at every turn. In some cases this works, such as the design of the Ectomobile and all the gadgets, however other elements haven't aged well.There is no real flow for the film, and whilst that contributes to an immediate story, a lot of context and background feels lost. More than anything, when placed in front of their first ghost, the team seem relatively unphased. The climactic villain isn't built into the story from the early stages despite its opening introduction, leading to the entire backstory being explained in one fleeting conversation. The plot all seems like an afterthought to the theme of hopping about to catch non-descript ghosts. Moreover, the special effects are very poor given the standard of other films of the time, but that probably adds to the nostalgia.A largely ad-libbed script, the leading trio have good chemistry without the acting being superb. It is very much a Murray-quipped led dialogue, and he takes lead from the start. Playing his usual character, a viewer's enjoyment of the film is utterly dependent on whether they enjoy his humour. The wider cast are good, Weaver with the best performance in terms of acting ability, but overall, every bit of filmmaking is secondary to an excellent first-of-its-kind concept on a Blockbuster level.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
An absolute classic,"Even now, nearly 20 years later this film is still as good as ever. Sure, the special FX world has moved on but they do not get in the way of a superb script and excellent direction from Ivan Reitman. How anyone can call this film 'boring' is totally beyond me.Bill Murray is absolutely superb in this - some of best work with the fantastic Groundhog Dog just beating his work in this. Some of his one liners are just hilarious and the cast's interaction with each other is a pleasure to watch (bar Ernie Hudson who just seems out of place and is the film's biggest weakness IMO). Sigourney Weaver does a decent job though her work as Ellen Ripley in the Alien series taxes herself a little more. Rick Moranis is fantastic though and its a shame he never seems to get more recognition than he does nowdays.If you've never seen Ghostbusters, then I implore you to go and grab it on DVD - its action packed, funny and even scary in some places. Just be wary of the Library scene in the early part of the film, scared the hell out of me when I saw it in my earlier years!!!9/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Ghostbusters,"Ghostbusters, now without question this is a iconic movie deeply ingrained in almost everyone's head, if only for the iconic soundtrack. And as a movie, it's still entertaining to this day. But I guess I'm just late to the party, because I didn't really fall in love with it as much as I'd hoped.First off as far as the concept goes, the production design and all the stuff behind it it's fantastic. It's props, the world, all great. The casting just as good with a perfect set of characters and actors put in place to fulfill a nice spectrum of comedic moments with each character and their unique traits. And as far as funny, this movie has some chuckle moments for sure. But I'm nowhere near crying of laughter, all subjective though. What this movie mostly has is some smart writing, and doesn't rely on too many gags. Making it age fairly well.Directing, imo, visually nothing too spectacular, excluding VFX, which obviously show their age, especially the dogs, the beams still look great to this day though. But as for directing I don't find it paced all that well nor anything special. It doesn't get very creative even though the script has a lot of opportunity for it.As a sidenote, funnily enough going into this movie I was expecting all these scenes where they build/design their car or equipment, but to my surprise there's none of that. It's just made off screen and that's that.Acting, mostly great, Murray shines as the headliner in a now familiar type of role and character, everyone else does their role as well but no-one is giving top of their career performances here.Music, the main soundtrack, obviously great. Everything else around it, pretty average.Not much else to say really. I didn't do all too much for me sadly.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Badly dated, but not dated enough to watch the remake","Few things in life are as painful and confronting than re-watching a childhood favorite, only now with your own kids, and having to hear after barely 30-40 minutes from your offspring that the film is boring and looking silly. No wait, I can think of something even more painful and confronting, and that's realizing yourself the childhood favorite isn't at all what you remembered it to be.I know ""Ghostbusters"" is pretty much considered a sacred classic, especially among loyal members of this great website, but let's face it ... ""Ghostbusters"" hasn't aged well, which isn't criticism but actually quite normal for a 35-year-old film! The once state-of-the-art and (deservedly so) Oscar-nominated special effects simply look mechanical and goofy nowadays. That's okay, though. I remember when they were great and how I was blown away by them when I was eight. But that was three decades ago, and I can't expect my own kids - age six and ten - are even slightly impressed. And not only the effects have dated badly. Lead characters like Bill Murray's cocky and exaggeratedly self-confident Dr. Venkman can't exist anymore, unless you aim for a series of #MeToo lawsuits. Everybody smokes, and they literally smoke everywhere, including public building, libraries and hospitals. You can refer to it as nostalgia, but it's stuff from the past, and righteously so.Still, I hold on to my fond memories and don't have the slightest intentions to ever watch the 2016 remake. That's one for the digital generation, like my own children, while I'll recall the giant Marshmallow-man, Sigourney Weaver's sexy stare, and - duh - the timeless Ray Parker Jr. theme song.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Well past use-by date,"Back in the early 80s, watching star trek reruns on TV,  I sometimes wondered whether those ""special effects"" had _ever_ looked cool to anyone?Watching Ghostbusters the other night for the first time since it first came out (when I saw it twice) I conclude: probably.Because Ghostbusters certainly hasn't aged well. I remember it has having some really impressive fireworks, fast-paced action, funny repartee, good characters... Gosh, in fact it's pretty lame! Just like in Star Trek, when the final showdown between the good guys and the bad guys is taking place, they sort of just stand around there, cracking weak jokes, and then shooting off some low-budget flames.It's weird how some movies can stay fresh forever while some go stale quickly.

The Ultimate in Paranormal Comedy,"What a movie! What an original, goofy, side-splitting movie! Ghostbusters is one of those projects were everything just came together. Somebody had an idea, somebody else believed in it, all the right people got involved, and everything just flowed, producing an instant classic and a landmark of popular culture. From one idea that Dan Akroyd worked on in his spare time came on of mid eighties' best pictures, and perhaps the best horror-comedy since the days of Abbot and Costello.That idea of course, is 'What if there really were ghosts? And what if there were people who made a living catching them?' And the screenplay has a lot of fun with that idea, treating it like real life, down to advertising blitz and regulatory headaches. Yet at the same time it embraces the more fantastic aspects of the story, playing up hauntings, possessions, and the apocalypse to great comedic effect. There's a real blending of the supernatural and the mundane that you don't see a lot, certainly not with such hilarious results.Equally important is the superb casting. Every actor and actress is perfect for his/her role, which is not surprising considering that some of the roles were written for them. Akroyd, as the co-writer, created for himself a role that plays wonderfully to his natural talents. In real life, he's a smart, earnest, kind off nerdy guy, so naturally it follows that he should be an overly-excitable, somewhat gullible nerd who pours himself into his work. Harold Ramis is brilliant as Egon, the straight faced dry intellectual, and Ernie Hudson brings a real down to earth likability to Winston. Sigourney Weaver shows that she definitely has what it takes to play comedies; I have no idea how she managed to keep from cracking up during the 'possessed' scenes.But it's Bill Murray who really steals the show. One if Murray's greatest strengths as an actor is his shiftiness, his blatant insincerity, and as a result he's at his best when playing the schemer, the con man. And Peter Venkman is just such a man. He's a fraud, a charlatan who makes his living studying things he doesn't even believe in- and a shameless womanizer to boot. His chemistry with Weaver is priceless, and throughout he maintains the comedic balancing act that he does so well; never flat or deadpan, but never quite over the top. It's really his character driving this whole enterprise, even if he has no idea what he's doing.There are some good action sequences here, and a handful of truly scary parts, like the now-famous librarian. I especially love the ending, with what is surely the funniest giant monster ever created- nice going, Ray. The special effects are generally pretty good for 1985, and even when they aren't it only adds to the movie's goofy feel.Ghostbusters is also one the most quotable pictures since Monty Python and the Holy Grail. There are plenty of instantly recognizable one-liners, like ""He slimed me"" and ""Back off man, I'm a scientist,"" and some wonderfully tongue in cheek speeches, like the famous 'Twinkie speech,' or the one early on that begins with ""Call it fate, call it luck, call it karma."" It's hard to pick just one, but I would have to say that my favorite line is """"Man, the superintendent is gonna be pi**ed!"" And the dialog works even when being 100% serious. The conversation between Ray and Winston about the book of Revelation is a minor masterpiece in its own right.What else is there to say about this movie? It's got a wonderful score by Elmer Bernstein, and a killer theme song by Ray Parker Junior that actually went to number one on the singles charts. There are gorgeous views of New York City and a double serving of Big Apple attitude. Any way you look at it, this is a great production with everything done right from beginning to end.

I officially got the video for my fifth birthday, however I snuck an early look at my birthday presents and pinched the unwrapped video, which means that I have been watching this film for twelve years through bad times and good times. Whenever I was glum it was there to cheer me up. Whenever I was bored it was there to entertain me. It's mix of comedy, fantasy, sci-fi and horror means that there is always something new to pick up on and to enjoy especially when watching the original widescreen version. Which leads me onto the superb DVD. I live in England and import many DVDs from America but none have ever excited me as much as the Ghostbusters one.

Akyroid and Ramis are also perfect in their roles (and this is coming from someone who doesn't really appreciate Akyroid's ""comedy"").This is one of the director's best films; the pacing is perfect, with action and comedy in a revolving door...

Ghostbusters is good old fashioned 80's fun.,"It's one of those international hits that's turned into a pop cultural phenomenon. There surely isn't a single soul who hasn't heard of Ghostbusters. Most people who know me will automatically think ""why did you buy this?"" as they know I'm not the biggest fan. However, loving the all-female reboot I just had to own the original and give it another shot. New York City is slowly experiencing more sightings of paranormal entities and ghostly spectres, so who you gonna call? Ghostbusters! (Sorry, couldn't resist). It's a story that's really built on the memorable witty characters. The Ghostbusting team divulge in sarcastic banter that provides some much needed humour which is sustained throughout the runtime. Whilst I didn't particularly laugh at any point, it's difficult not to smile with what's presented on screen. Lead Ghostbuster Bill Murray gives a consistently charismatic performance that brings the team alive. Harold Ramis and Dan Ackroyd also give fun performances. Sigourney Weaver was unusual casting, prefer her being a badass. Rick Moranis...I just can't. I've never really warmed to him in anything. It's an imaginative premise with plenty of creativity embedded in the futuristic technology. The ghosts themselves were well designed, Slimer and the giant Stay Puft Marshmallow Man have proven to be unforgettable and are constantly referenced still today. The main antagonist being an ancient Babylonian deity was unfortunately not really fully explored. The primary focus was the Ghostbusters themselves to which the film succeeds. Most of the practical effects have held up well, the visual effects not so much. Particularly the animation for the ""Keymaster"" and ""Gatekeeper"" when moving in beast form. I like Ghostbusters, how could I not...I just don't rate it all that much. It's just good old fashioned 80's popcorn fun that everyone can enjoy.

It just didn't do it for me.,"As a comedy, it wasn't funny. As a mild horror movie, it wasn't thrilling.It was so boring I felt like shooting myself. The ending was nice and Mr. Puff was nifty, but couldn't they have made it less freaking boring? It reminded me of watching someone play a video game, but scripted. There wasn't nearly enough action to keep me interested. The cliché sub-plots used in pretty much every comedy ever made just got really annoying.I guess I can say it was an original idea for the time it came out, and that it is worth watching just to know the thousands of references, but I can't say it was much fun at all. Maybe you just had to have grown up with this movie to love it, because I certainly didn't.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Who Ya Gonna Call?,"""Ghostbusters"" was a huge hit at the box office in 1984 and is easily one of the funniest and most creative films ever made.  College students Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis decide to quit school and start a company that fights supernatural entities after they see one firsthand at a New York library.  What follows is a fast-paced and hilarious thrill-ride of a movie that never does seem old or dated.  Sigourney Weaver, Rick Moranis, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts, and William Atherton are all super in supporting roles.  The screenplay is really smart and the direction by Ivan Reitman is always focused.  Very funny and highly enjoyable.  4.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Good old-fashioned entertainment at its best.,"The film must have been phenomenal for its time. Even at today's standard, the visual effects are still amazing, so it must have been groundbreaking back in '84. It deservedly was also nominated for an Oscar for Best Visual Effects. In a time well before CGI was so advanced, this was incredibly believably done. From the plot to the acting and the music, this is entertainment deluxe. Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd are legends!

great mixture of dry humour and fun special effects,"A fun story with a great mixture of dry humour and fun special effects. The casting is spot on in this film and the sound design is great. Its a classic with a slight underdog element. Pretty much everyone is perfectly cast, the film has gone on to become iconic, especially it's soundtrack, it remains a great movie for Halloween too. Some of the special effects are really well done, I also thought the little guy with glasses was hilarious, he gets some of the best lines in the film, ""okay, who brought the dog?"" The movie has produced a couple of sequels now and reboots but nothing that really matches up to this original.

Loved it as a kid?  You might still like it today.,"Ghost Busters is one of those movies which when you were ten years old seemed like the greatest thing you'd ever seen and when you are thirty years old you wonder what all the fuss was about. It's certainly not by any means a bad movie but in retrospect it's not by any means a great movie either. It's a charming, but only intermittently funny, comedy with some jazzy (at least for 1984) special effects thrown in to liven up the proceedings.The plot of this movie is a rather simple one. New York City has a problem with ghosts and three scientists form a ghost-catching company. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis play the three original ghost busters with Ernie Hudson joining up later. Murray is undoubtedly the star. His character of Peter Venkman gets most of the best lines and as you would expect Murray delivers them brilliantly. Aykroyd and Ramis are fine in their roles but they'll never outshine Murray who is terrific whether delivering some sly, understated humor or being completely over the top and totally off the wall. Annie Potts as the Ghost Busters' receptionist, Sigourney Weaver as Venkman's potential love interest and Rick Moranis as Weaver's exceptionally nerdy neighbor round out the principal cast. Moranis in particular has some choice comic moments and his character of Louis probably trails only Murray's Venkman in the laughs department.With its solid cast and plenty of subtle, witty dialogue the movie has a lot going for it. And there are some rather exciting, and sometimes amusing confrontations between the ghosts and the Ghost Busters. The movie certainly has its moments but there are too many instances where the film just kind of sits there and the story struggles to move forward. But there is ultimately a great payoff in the end with an undeniably brilliant final scene. If you expect an all-time comedy classic you may well be disappointed but if your expectations are a touch more realistic you will find that Ghost Busters is a reasonably enjoyable film and that's not so bad.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
The mystery of why this movie is so good,"For me, Ghostbusters is a very special movie. I watched when I was very little, and it has been one of my favorites movie during my whole life. I loved the movie when I was young, and then, when I grew up, it became even better when many jokes and plot points I didn't get as a kid, finally made sense. But the question remains, why this movie is so good?.I think the enduring charm of Ghostbusters is that is a perfect mix of comedy and horror. The movie is a comedy, but it takes itself completely seriously in its absurd premise, so the movie feels completely grounded in reality. It's basically our world, but with real ghosts in it (I think it helps that Dan Aykroid actually believes in all this weird stuff). This makes al the tension in the movie feel real, and the action looks compelling and believable. The effects sometimes have some failures in some animations, but all in all, it looks great, and really spooky.Regarding the comedy, the main point is that the movie is not over-indulgent in its humor. Of course, Bill Murray is the funniest character in the movie, but he is restrained, and, although he's basically a meta-guy of sorts in midst of the ridiculousness of the plot, in the end he is really commited in the action, and gives an excellent performance. He is, of course, the fan-favorite character of the movie, but let's not forget all the rest of the cast, which makes this movie a memorable experience.I think Ghostbusters is perhaps the best comedy of the 80s. I think to further describe it would be redundant. My recomendation is just watch it, and enjoy it.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
I like the ghosts but I miss the Busts...,"I never saw this as a kid and I must say it does hold its own admirably.What I find strange about it is how quickly it moves past all some major plot stuff and how slowly it approaches what is basically filler. But although the pacing is jolty, it never drags and the special effects are very impressive even now.It's not really about ghosts, it's about demons. They're demon hunters.Comic acting is impeccable and I'm fascinated by Murray's no-means-yes courtship style.Overall I must say that the whole thing feels a bit sterile.Here's the point where I make you really, really angry but it's the truth: I used to say that if this movie was half as good as its remake then I am in for a good time. Well it was just about half as good.I love you, Holtzman!",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Do Not Call,"NYC is inundated with ghosts, leading to steady employment for a trio of ghost busters. This is supposed to be a comedy, but there's hardly anything here that's worth a chuckle. The script is meant to deliver both thrills and laughs, but fails miserably on both fronts. To paraphrase the only piece of dialog that is even mildly amusing here: this film is witless - it's true; it has no wit. Aykroyd and Ramis co-wrote the uninspired script and gave themselves boring straight-man roles. Murray is supposed to be the funny one and he tries to enliven things, but he's given little to work with. The special effects are cheesy and this lame film rambles on far too long.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Ghosts! They're real!,"Let me begin my review with a frank statement. I am sick of people calling Ghostbusters 'the funniest comedy of all time'. Why? Because I never once saw Ghostbusters as a comedy. As a young kid, as a teenager, and as an adult I always saw this film as 'a supernatural thriller with humor'.It's not shot, edited, performed, scored, or designed as a comedy. No way! Aykroyd's genuine interest in the paranormal is where the idea for the movie began. When he teamed with Harold Ramis to write the script there's no doubt in my mind that his intended tone was serious, but with touches of light relief (mainly from Venkman and Louis). Listen carefully to the dialogue, it's peppered with loads of credible scientific jargon and multiple cryptic references of almost Lovecraftian lore. This serious subtext weighs the film down in the thriller category more than comedy.The trio (and soon quartet) begin as researchers at Columbia University in NYC. But Venkman, only in it for an easy scam, ends up getting them thrown off campus. Ray and Egon have a plan for catching and eliminating paranormal threats to the public. With Venkman's conman skills, they take a chance and found 'Ghostbusters' in a derelict firehouse. Business is pitiful until Dana Barrett shows up claiming a voice from another dimension spoke to her through her fridge. Venkmen, enchanted by her, goes to her apartment to check her/it out. He finds nothing, unaware that behind her fridge is a secret doorway to a rooftop temple built as the venue point for Gozer, a destructive inter-dimensional traveler.Almost every aspect of Ghostbusters is honed to perfection. Ivan Reitman has never directed a better film. Elmer Bernstein's sumptuous score (often overshadowed by Ray Parker Junior's pop song) is utterly bewitching. The effects, while old-school, don't date the film one bit. The chemistry between the cast is wonderful, you actually believe that these guys have known each other for years. The fact that Harold Ramis plays the deadpan, deadly serious Egon despite having directed Caddyshack and Vacation (two of the most anarchic films ever) gives the chemistry a nice edge, since beneath the serious exterior you know he's actually the maddest one of the lot.However, I WILL complain about one thing (though it is relatively minor). I understand that movies need to be tightly edited to stop the audience from nodding off (but no one possibly could with Ghostbusters), but Reitman's last-minute tinkering renders a large chunk of the film senseless. It begins as soon as Winston arrives. He claims to the Mayor that he's worked with the company for a couple of weeks, but within the timeline of the movie he's only worked for them for a single day. Venkman's impromptu meeting with Dana at Lincoln Center is badly pasted on over Winston's 'interview'. Venkman arrives at the firehouse covered in slime, warps to Dana without slime, arranges a date for Thursday (which actually appears to be later that same night), before warping back to the firehouse, slime intact for his confrontation with Walter Peck (William Atherton, who has been typecast ever since).The original flow of the film included a scene at Fort Detmerring in which Ray and Winston investigate alone. Part of this scene is in the final product (Ray's encounter with a female ghost while dressed as a General) and the scene where Ray and Winston discuss the end of the world was actually their trip back from this scene. With this complete sequence intact, and the surrounding scenes rearranged, the timeline of the film would have made much more sense. Ivan Reitman has shown this complete version as private screenings, but I doubt the public will ever get to see it. The closest you will get is Richard Mueller's novelization 'Ghostbuster's: The Supernatural Spectacular'. You can hunt it down, but it's very expensive.With much of Winston's screen time cut back, the character almost becomes largely redundant. Thankfully, he was developed more in the animated series and the sequel. And, redundant or not, it just wouldn't be the same without him.I'm not one for nostalgia, but 80s kitsch aside, Ghostbusters truly will stand the test of time forever. It's an absolute classic that'll never get old and truly deserves to be up there with the best of them.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together... Mass Hysteria!","3 would-be scientists working at the University are looking into the paranormal and testing students. They get kicked out of practice due to some slightly unethical tests (and the fact that everyone doubts their field of study and thinks they are nuts!) so they decide to go into business for themselves as ""Ghostbusters"". They create all manner of tools and gadgets in order to hunt for and trap ghosts, expanding their business and eventually recruiting help along the way too. Unbeknownst to anybody a long dead Sumerian deity called Dozer is attempting to make a come back and it's up to the Ghostbusters to put an end to the chaos and evil.This is one of my favorite films of all time and is a classic film which stands out as one of the best in the 80's. It is filled the rafters with great humour as well as scares and horror a plenty too. As a young boy I was memorized watching this and wanted to be a Ghostbuster! Watching this film back has never disappointing me and I usually find something new which I didn't catch on other viewings. The cast is fantastic and adds much to the success of the featuring Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, Harold Ramis, Ernie Hudson, Rick Moranis, Annie Potts, Sigourney Weaver all deliver excellent performances. Ivan Reitmen did an excellent job with the film as director balancing the effects with genuine dialogue acting, he let some of the actors improvise their own lines to brilliant effect. I reckon that Ackroyd and Ramis's script was already creative and hilarious but it's not often that you get a director who gives control to some of the stars to do what they do best when they aren't in feature films (most of the main stars were comedic stars on late night American TV shows). Some of the special effects look a little dated nowadays but not all of them, some still stand up as effective and as appealing as they were in the 80's when this was wowing audiences around the world. You have to remember this was before what we consider to be modern CGI so a lot of the effects you see are lessons learned from cinema over the years. As for music or a soundtrack, can you honestly say you've gone through life without hearing Ray Parker Jr's classic titular anthem?!The success of this film led to cartoons, comics, a sequel, a range of toys, and whole host of moments which still get referenced today.Family friendly, full of fun, great visuals and soundtrack, memorable to this day, I could write soo many great things about this but I'll end by saying that you really can't go wrong watching this great film!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Classic Comedy That Gets Better With Time,"Ghostbusters (1984)**** (out of 4)Classic comedy about three parapsychology professors (Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis) who set up a business where they trap ghosts. Soon New York City is overrun with various ghouls and goblins as Judgement Day might be coming and it's up to the group to try and stop it. GHOSTBUSTERS was made as a summer blockbuster but it went way beyond your typical blockbuster style and ended up becoming one of the greatest comedies ever made. It could be argued that the cast and director were never better in their careers and that all of them were at the top of their game while making this picture. I think a great deal of the credit has to go to the screenplay, which mixes in the special effects with some very sly dialogue that really makes you believe everything you're seeing. The paranormal aspects of the story are so well done that you can easily accept what's going on and this here takes care of the adventure side of the story. The screenplay really goes all out when it comes to the comedy as we get one non-stop laugh after another because the dialogue always has our characters winking at the viewer and especially the character played by Murray. While all of the performances are great it's clearly Murray's show as he works wonders with the womanizer who has a smart reply to anything going on. Seeing Murray work the dialogue the way he does and the way he brings humor to his part is something truly remarkable to watch because he makes it seem so easy. Both Aykroyd and Ramis are also at the top of their game and the trio really do work extremely well together and in the end they could be called one of the most memorable comedies teams in the history of cinema. Even the smaller roles are played to perfection with Sigourney Weaver as one of the clients, Rick Moranis as her nerdy neighbor, Annie Potts as the wise-cracking receptionist and Ernie Hudson as the fourth worker. THe special effects hold up extremely well today even when you compare them to the recent CGI trend. Just take a look at Slimer to see how perfect the visual effects are but it's also important that these creatures are so memorable as they also add an additional bit of life to the film. Slimer is in the movie just a matter of minutes and yet he too became rather legendary in his own right. GHOSTBUSTERS is about as flawless as a comedy can get as we get pretty much everything you'd want in a picture like this. There have been many films to come along since but none of them have contained the amount of magic, charm and just all out fun as what you get.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Who ya gonna call?,"Another movie I've been missing out on...until now! This movie is just hilarious, with everyone giving a terrific performance. The main cast of Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis are great together and Rick Moranis is awesomely funny in a smaller role as a nerdy accountant who lives in the same apartment building as Sigourney Weaver. On Sigourney Weaver: there was nothing particularly bad about her performance, but she did seem a little underwritten. There was one great scene she had with Bill Murray after she gets possessed, but other than that she was merely a plot device/damsel in distress. Moving on to other facets of the production, I thought the soundtrack was top-notch, cheesy 80's goodness and the title song was especially memorable and catchy. Visual effects is one area where I felt the film to be a bit lacking, although it probably was some of the best effects the early 80's had to offer. In my opinion, the animatronics and claymation/stop-motion work was better than some early CG. This especially becomes apparent in the ridiculously convoluted final act, and is preceded by a hastily (but hilariously) resolved conflict with an EPA agent. Other than, I didn't really see any major problems with the writing. It just seemed like the scope of the film could have stayed smaller towards the end and been just as enjoyable. Nevertheless, I did enjoy the film a lot and am now ""in the know"" about a film that has left an indelible mark on pop culture. So, who ya gonna call?

"Playful, Tongue in Cheek and Fun","The Ghostbusters are one of the most well known teams to exist in fiction, and director Ivan Reitman understands how to present the characters onto the big screen with flurries of action and humour.Dan Aykroyd is super charming and brings huge spirit onto the screen. Harold Ramis is compelling although his screen time feels limited and his character is underdeveloped. Bill Murray is amusing but his character has a mean streak that is evident in the first act.Ghostbusters as at times a marvel. The special effects look awesome and shots of them are held long enough to really understand and enjoy the look of the animated creatures. The scope of the cityscapes with ghosts running amock is incredible.Where my main criticisms lie are in its first act, which simply takes too long to get going and is oddly skewed towards romance. The script is also quite mediocre in the later half with the main villain being underdeveloped and some characters behaving unrealistically stupid.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
A defining film of the 80s - but hasn't aged that well.,"Ghostbusters is widely acknowledged as one of the defining movies of the 1980s. Everyone seems to remember it fondly and you still hear ""Don't cross the streams"" and ""I am the Keymaster"" randomly quoted from time to time.Now I'm not here to burst any bubbles, I have nothing but positive thoughts whenever the movie is mentioned, but watching the 25th Anniversary edition recently I began to second guess its standing.Immediately after watching the film again the other night I thought that it is not realistic to call Ghostbusters one of the ""all time"" classics. Sure it is a good movie, charming and at times amusing, but it is not in the same league as other 80s flicks.Then a funny thing happened, two days passed and I allowed my memory to elevate Ghostbusters back up the pecking order then I re-read my notes. Therefore I think Ghostbusters is perhaps a better concept than film, and I'm not knocking those that love this film and stand up for it, I just don't see it in the same light as say ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" or even ""Stripes"", let alone ""Die Hard"" or ""Aliens"".Perhaps it was more your circumstances, I'm positive that movies I saw in my teens and early 20s are remembered more favourably simply because they were great times period in my life (not that now is so horrible), and I am now more analytical (unfortunately) and unforgiving when I am watching a film for the first time.Anyway Ghostbusters. Not a bad film in any respect, just not as good as some think.The film of course is about three guys who for no known reason start a paranormal investigation company after having their research grant summarily dragged. The three are Peter (Bill Murray), Ray (Dan Ackroyd) and Egon (Harold Ramis), Egon is the nerdy genius, Ray the ideas man and driving force behind the business and Peter just tags along for something to do and to get girls.As always Bill Murray is also the main reason to watch the film, and he provides most of the laughs throughout, including some that result from seemingly ad-libbed remarks after another character speaks.Their first mission is successful yet destructive, and luckily they find they have entered into a growth market, as paranormal activity increases in New York dramatically shortly after they commence operations. Due to the escalation in demand they hire a new ""Buster"" Winston, who doesn't do much in the film but obviously balanced out the poster.Their first client is Sigourney Weaver as Dana, who has a demonic possession in her fridge, (don't we all?), she happens to live in an apartment building that is a conduit for all that is evil in New York, and she wondered why the rent was so cheap? She is taken and possessed, as is her neighbour Lewis (Rick Moranis), and they begin a hunt for each other referring to themselves as the Gatekeeper and the Keymaster respectively.As there must be conflict in any movie the Environmental Protection Agency shuts down Ghostbusters operations and in doing so inadvertently release all their captured ghosties, increasing the very need for their existence, which doesn't help as they are in jail.This leads to the reason why I think the film is remembered in such a good light, once the boys are in jail and the ghosts cut loose New York cries out for their assistance, so the finale is not simply four guys in overalls running around with weird backpacks, but that plus a crowd of vocally supportive New Yorkers egging them on.At times it is almost like a sporting contest how the crowd interaction actually seems to elevate the importance of the Ghostbuster's actions, and it definitely gives the latter scenes a bit more buzz.Ultimately Ghostbusters is a fun film, though lightweight harmless and largely disposable. I would consider it a good rental every few years so that you might throw it in and shut your brain off for 90 minutes, but I can't see why people obsess over it.Final Rating – 6.5 / 10. We all know the plot now, and 90% of the laughs of the laughs are from Bill Murray, but that could be said about all his films.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"80's movie, it's that simple","Ghostbusters is an 80's movie through and through. It has an odd set up for the plot, and some typical characters pop up throughout. These three parapsychology professors get canned from their job (Murray, Ramis, Aykroyd), and decide to start a ghost catching business based on hardly any data, and with virtually no funding. After they get up and running, things get ugly when the environmentalist steps in and demands they be shut down. Well, the fragile ghost holding tank does get turned off, and guess what, chaos ensues (you have to watch the movie to find out, because I'm not telling). The sub-plot is very strange, because all these released ghosts are really going to be a part of the great Gozer's plan that started with the Hitites in 6000 B.C. What is that about? I found the plot to be a bit confusing, the characters ill-developed, and there were some definite lags in dialog. But, the movie also had some very funny scenes, and light-hearted feel, and a very large marshmallow (gotta see that part). I also found the secretary (Potts) to be a source of comic relief.The characters I felt were typical were the evil business guy who tries to shut down the ghostbusters, the sexy, girl next door lead (Weaver) whom the sleazy professor (Murray) wants a piece of, and her dorky neighbor (Moranis) who just can't catch a break. The typical plot was that the evil guy shuts down business, and from there things get ugly. Overall, the movie is worth a watch, and theme song is very catchy. But it is not going to be a part of my DVD collection any time soon.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Great comedy,Ghostbusters is considered a classic of the comedy genre. It's a very well paced film and the acting by everyone involved is top notch. Unlike the female remake the great thing about this film is how the acting compliments the script and nothing seems forced. Another great addition is the sparing use of CGI which compared to the overindulgence in the remake really stands out.

Does not hold up well over time (a second viewing),"When this movie came out, ""Saturday Night Live"" was arguably at its peak, Star Wars mania was at its crest, and special effects wizards almost took their place with directors as the most important talent in making a movie.This film had it all--two SNL stars wise cracking their way through a science fiction/ horror film with some original special effects.  However, like eating rock candy, the second piece does not satisfy after you realize there is no substance to what is there--only a sugar rush.Amazingly, when ""panned and scanned"" for Television/video the TV actors do not even hold their own.This movie might hold up better when HDTV comes along (yeah, right)!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Ghostbuster 4k Bluray Review,"This is the fourth release of Ghostbusters post DVD era and the first and most obvious question is, is it the best release to date or even worth the upgrade if you own the previous releases? In short, if you have the right TV and AV equipment then the answer is YES!.Picture Quality:Sony has done a fine job of improving the image of a film that is now well over 30 years old, upping the resolution to 2160p and adding HDR could have been an easy way of just churning out another release of a film that has a gigantic following for an easy cash-in. Yet adding this new technology to this disc helps the picture quality by improving the contrast, colour and brightness which make this release a real enjoyment to watch (again).First thing first, does Ghostbusters have the polish and glitter like some of the more modern movies that have been released? No, the grain of the original is still there and present throughout the entire film, however, the image has been enhanced and in places looks tremendous with primary colours, in particular, making the picture pop. Skin-tones are more natural looking than ever and there is plenty of detail to be found where it could not be found before. One drawback I find on a lot of older films that have had a 4k transfer are the darker areas where the blacks become pixelated which I am glad to report I did not see once whilst watching the film in its entirety.Audio Quality:If you are unsure as to why you should buy/upgrade to this release this is one area where this disc excels. Adding a Dolby Atmos soundtrack to a film of this age could have just been done to get the ""Atmos"" badge on the box to entice people to make a purchase, but this really does excel and I was amazed how good of a job Sony has done in this area.The previous Blu-ray releases have a True HD 7.1 track onboard which is great and a vast improvement over the original VHS and DVD versions, but the Atmos track supplied on this 4K disc is a major upgrade. Using the object based technology adds to the atmosphere right through the film in particular towards the end of the film where our team of parapsychologists are in a battle with main antagonist Gozer and this is where the Atmos truly shines with pieces of the building noticeably falling from above. The charge of the proton packs humming in the background the proton beams blasting from every angle. As the saying goes they saved the best to last, in the scene where Gozer asks Ray (Stantz) ""Are you a God"" the booming voice of Gazo surrounds you from everywhere like a voice from God and is truly one of my favourite parts of any Atmos track I have heard to date.Overall:There a few points I would like to make here. As I said at the start of this review to get the most out of any 4k release you need the right equipment, If you have a 4k TV and 4k player and are using TV speakers then you obviously will not be getting the required effects from the Atmos track, for this you will need either an Atmos-enabled soundbar or preferably a capable AV receiver and speaker setup to maximize the effects from these releases.Also, the scores below are based on the age and previous releases of the film, the video is a huge improvement from earlier releases but when compared to the likes of Dunkirk it is somewhat left behind for obvious reasons.(I will be writing an article soon on what equipment Is required to get the most from these newer releases)Score:Video: 4/5Audio 4.5/5",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

As for other technical aspects, there is nothing worth mentioning.The story itself is nothing special. On the one hand, we have a mediocre scenario. In ""Groundhog Day"" and ""Analyze This"", Harold Ramis showed that he can do much better. On the other hand, the fantastic cast mostly saved the movie with improvised remarks and gags. A film with a crew like this just can't fail.Most of the film was carried out by the genius Bill Murray, whose charisma, facial expressions, and witty remarks are in themselves reason enough to watch ""Ghostbusters"". When you team up Bill with Dan Aykroyd, the screenwriter and lead actor of ""The Blues Brothers"", one of the best comedies of all time, who also collaborated on ""Ghostbusters"" screenplay, you get chemistry that doesn't lag far behind the one Dan had with Belushi. The remaining two Ghostbusters are played by Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson.As if this wasn't enough, two more big names were added to the cast. To open a portal that will bring the demon god to Manhattan, his followers must possess two people. The first client to the newly founded ""Ghostbusters"", for whom the character of Bill Murray totally went crazy, was none other than the heroine of ""Alien"" and ""Gorillas in the Mist"", an actress of great talent and beauty, Sigourney Weaver. The other one is Rick Moranis, a comedian we remember from the eighties' films such as ""Streets of Fire"", ""Brewster's Millions"", ""Little Shop of Horrors"", ""Spaceballs"" and ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"".And finally, we must not forget the legendary song of the same name by Ray Parker Jr., probably the most recognizable and unforgettable detail of this film.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Who are you gonna call?,"Ghostbusters is a classic film about hunting supernatural activity. Though it may not be as a classic as Scooby Doo. Regardless, Ghostbusters still is a classic 80's film.

Definitely seems like a Halloween movie with the paranormal.I could definitely see the technological difficulties of the time with all the visual effects.

Some things ARE as good as you remembered them being.  Some are even better.  This is neither.,"Were you roughly as old as I was (eleven; or let's say, no older than sixteen) when ""Ghostbusters"" first came out?  Did you enjoy it then?  Has it been a decade or so since you last saw it?  If so, time for a revisit: you'll be surprised how bad it is.Such weak writing!  The humour is all in the wisecracks, but not one of them is memorable or (in itself) funny or in any way witty.  If we are fooled into thinking otherwise, it's due to Bill Murray.  It happens in every film he appears in (that is, those that aren't antecedently funny).  His character is cynical in the most innocent way, his delivery is impeccable, we really want his words to be amusing as well - so much so that we're prepared to pretend.The premise of ""Ghostbusters"" is cool, too.  We want to be transported into a world in which there are ghostbusters of this kind, so much so that we're prepared to overlook the fact that we're watching fumbled comedy rather than successful fantasy.  Again, Bill Murray helps.  His I'm-game-for-anything character is the only one who seems to belong.Surprisingly good is Elmer Bernstein's score.  Strange how I hadn't noticed the general decline of film scores over the past seventeen years.  If it weren't for Bernstein and Murray, I doubt anyone would have taken ""Ghostbusters"" seriously enough to even mistake it for a comedy.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"They came, they saw, they briefly conquered the 80s.","A trio of misfit parapsychologists set up business as Ghostbusters. Ideal really because although slow at first, their business starts to boom as New York comes under threat from a supernatural force.Dan Aykroyd had this idea about space Ghostbusters in the future and the plan was to have himself and fellow Blues Brother, John Belushi, star in it. Pitching it to producer and director Ivan Reitman saw the basic concept retained but eventually it became what we now know as Ghostbusters. Co-written with Harold Ramis {also a co-star}, Aykroyd's genesis turned not only into a ""monster"" smash it at the box office, but also into a pop-cultural ""phenomenon"". In fact it actually is nice to re-visit the film these days without the public euphoria that swamped the movie for what seemed like a decade. T-shirts with the Ghostbusters logo on were everywhere, a telephone number if you rang it would have the Busters on answer phone, whilst the title song from Ray Parker Jr could be heard on the hour every hour on the radio. Even the catch phrase of ""who ya gonna call?"" was being used by the young, the old and the restless. Marketing genius or cynical tactics covering a sub-standard film?Well ultimately the film is really rather ace, it has some problems for sure {the effects were bad back then, never mind now and Ernie Hudson a token addition to the team} but it's razor sharp with its wit and has a mass appeal to people of all ages. It's a basic odd ball's to the rescue plot, but the differing characterisations and comedy lift it considerably higher than similarly themed films that had come prior to it. That it boasts a bigger budget and Bill Murray of course helps the cause. Murray was brought in after Belushi had left the mortal coil, and promptly owns the film. His Dr Venkmen is a fusion of sarcasm, biting one liners and sees science as a way of getting girls. All of which blends mirthfully with the polar opposites that are Aykroyd's Stanz and Ramis' Spengler. Sigourney Weaver lights up the screen as the soon to be possessed, and chased by Venkmen, Dana Barrett and Rick Moranis does meek goof-ball supreme as Louis Tully. There's also value to be found in the script courtesy of some political nudging as the mayor is aware of vote power, while the human element badness and cynicism comes from William Atherton's {suitably weasel like} stiff suit Walter Peck.Given its success {it made a worldwide profit of almost $262 million} a sequel was inevitable. Amiable enough as it was, it was a pale shadow the first film and even recycled the ending. So stick with this bad boy then, a fun film for all that serves as a reminder of when the world went Ghostbuster barmy. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Casting for this movie is perfect and that's what makes it the classic it is today,First of all the casting for this movie is brilliant bill Murray as the sarcastic one Dan akroyd as the cheery one Harold ramis the smart one and Ernie Hudson as the one who only wants a check one and rick moranis who is an annoying neighbour for Sigourney weaver and the when he gets locked out sequences are classic and no one could ever forget the classic theme by Ray Parker Jr and this will forever be the best ghostbusters movie because the sequel didn't have the same impact as the first one it was still good though,10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

"The Most Successful Mixture of Horror and Comedy, Hands Down","Three scientists of the paranormal, kicked out of their cushy university jobs, pursue careers in the private sector as investigators of ghosts and such... and not a moment too soon, because there is about to be an explosion of hauntings in the New York area!There is not much to say about ""Ghostbusters""... it is a classic, hands down. The theme song is known even by non-fans, there was a great sequel, action figures, video games, a cartoon series... everyone in this went on to big things (some were already big). You do not get many horror comedies that appeal to people outside the genre, but this one does (along with the sequel).Director Ivan Reitman knew what he was doing. Although perhaps better known for his comedies, he actually started out working with master of horror David Cronenberg. When he came to ""Ghostbusters"", he had every intention of making it scary. And he succeeded. Perhaps not generally thought of as horror because of its wide appeal, there are some legitimately scary moments. The librarian early on? Quite a shock!And that is it.

GHOST BUSTERS (DIDIER BECU),"This is one of the classics of the eighties, I even had the (terrible) soundtrack on vinyl but the big question of course is : is it fun to watch in 2003?

I went through most of the reviews on this page and it must have something to do with the fact I never found Murray a funny guy but I can't think of one joke I particulary liked in this movie. Murray, Aykroyd and Ramis are the three immortal ghostbusters but twenty years later it all looks so crappy, it's just like a lasershow from some discotheque and damn difficult to believe this was one of the most expensive productions ever...

Bustin' Still Makes me Feel Good,"40 years ago, up and coming comedy director Ivan Reitman and comic all stars Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis released the unique supernatural comedy Ghostbusters. Based on a concept from Aykroyd himself, the film was an unexpected blockbuster upon its summer 1984 release and became a cultural milestone from the 1980s onward, complete with a few sequels, television spin offs and endless merchandise. Looking back at the film for its 40 year anniversary, it is still regarded as a comedy-horror classic and there's a lot to see why in regards to how special it proved to be.The main story follows three eccentric parapsychologists Peter Venkman, Ray Stantz, and Egon Spengler, who start a ghost-catching business in New York City. A fairly concrete premise for a horror comedy intact, and the end result goes from a series of the group catching ghosts across Manhattan to then having to take down the supernatural threat Gozer who could lead the gates of Hell into the city. In addition to being an ambitious comedy, Ghostbusters is also somewhat of an imaginative horror feature with numerous ghosts and ghouls inspired by Dan Aykroyd's fascination with the supernatural. The laughs come in large part from the buddy chemistry of Murray, Aykroyd and Ramis and their individual quirks and personalities bounce off one another well as they try to catch all of the different ghosts in town. In addition, a small romance builds between Venkman and cellist Dana Barrett whose own apartment leads to the gates of Hell, and while the laughs and thrills are what makes this film work so well, this small love angle keeps the film's heart close in contact.In addition to the three leads, the cast as a whole make this film work well on its own, especially Sigourney Weaver as Dana who is as beautiful as she is tough, even while being possessed by Zuul. Rick Moranis is also a nice addition as Dana's neighbor Louis Tully whose geeky personality contrasts once he gets possessed as well, although it is quite obvious how his arc with Dana fares out compared to Venkman. Ernie Hudson portrays the newly hired Ghostbuster Winston Zeddemore with a slick suaveness and Annie Potts delivers some of the funniest deadpan lines as secretary Janine Melnitz whereas William Atherton captures the EPA representative Walter Peck with a cynical and overzealous array that makes you question how much he cares for the well being of others compared to his own beliefs. The ghouls themselves are quite a fright to behold, and the mere presence of Gozer is elevated by the sinister voice of Paddi Edwards. With a high budgeted action horror comedy like this, the cast are what truly make Ghostbusters a fun watch.But of course, another big reason to watch this movie after four decades is the incredible special effects and creature designs led by Richard Edlund. Considering the production team had a fairly tight schedule to work with, the numerous amount of detail and compositing they did for the ghosts is still quite fascinating, even if some of the greenscreen compositing looks a bit outdated. While many people remember the marketable designs of Slimer and the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man to this day, the horrific stop motion and regular puppet models of Zuul and Vinz still hold up in just how threatening and freaky they are in pure motion. When one considers how much puppetry was used in this film before CGI became the industry norm, then the Ghostbuster laser effects are cool to marvel at from the mere tensity alone, although the actual action sequences are pretty tame on their own, possibly due to technological limitations at the time. Add on Laszlo Kovacs' naturally grim cinematography and Elmer Bernstein's timeless eerie score and you've got a film filled with state of the art special effects.By blending humor and horror seamlessly along with its great cast, Ghostbusters still holds up as a unique supernatural comedy that has impacted pop culture and cinema so well over the last four decades. Now that the latest installment Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire has come out for audiences to enjoy, this year truly is a worthwhile time to celebrate and honor the original movie for all the success it garnered over the years. As Ray Parker jr.'s endlessly catchy theme song said it best, bustin makes us feel good even after all these years.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
A 1980's Classic... I guess...,"The '80's had a certain charm. The '80's also had a lot of bad hair, bad fashion, bad music, and bad acting in bad movies. I like Sigourne Weaver, but she was stiff as a board in this movie. Bill Murray was funny, but often mean-spirited in his humor (typical of the SNL alumni in the 1980's, but cheap and I don't like it). As for the rest, I find it all very silly. Rick Moranis, DanAkroyd, silly, silly. Ernie Hudson gave what was probably the best acting performance in this film (as the 6th lead... this guy was lucky to find a sandwich left for him at Craft Services). Anyway, this review proves that I am (at least attempting to be) unbiased in my critique of these films on IMDB. I really don't like this movie. I liked it as a child, and I resent it now as an adult. But, I can't argue that it was a big hit, that I DID like it (once upon a time), and that it contains some iconic moments in film.So, I feel my 6 rating is more than fair.

Bill Murray comedy is a silly cult classic but not screamingly funny...,"I never did find this one screamingly funny, as some Bill Murray fans obviously do.It's got a preposterous story with some good special effects (for those slimy, jello-like green images) and if quirky characters are your thing, you'll find plenty of them among the cast of characters. But a wittier script by Bill Murray would have helped.In other words, I can take it or leave it--that's exactly how I felt when this comedy was over. Sure, there were some fun moments with Rick Moranis as a nosy neighbor and I'll admit Murray and Dan Ackroyd have some good one-liners. Then too, Sigourney Weaver is amusing as the gal with a fridge from hell, but by the time the overlong story got to its mindblowing conclusion, I was longing for ""The End"" to appear on the screen.Not my cup of tea as comedies go. Best moments were when the ghosts were on the loose and things got a little unpredictable toward the conclusion.

Greatest 80s movie of the 80s - thankfully doesn't look too 80s.,"This movie was a huge commercial success when it opened, partly because it mixed big budget visual effects with small scale human comedy, but also because the perfectly cast and designed Ghostbusters created such a memorable impression that audiences seemingly had the movie etched on their consciousness for decades afterward.Ghostbusters follows basic comedy plot tropes, broadly speaking; when three unsuccessful parapsychologists are removed from their campus, they face the reality of starting a business in a competitive, uncaring world. In doing so, they offer to capture ghosts with high end industrial lasers, and along the way, lovable goof-ball Peter Venkman (Bill Murray) falls in love with Dana Barrett, a concert cellist who initially rejects him.The movie effortlessly combines sci-fi with horror, fantasy, comedy and romance elements, and no element ever feels out of place or at odds with the underlying structure. The films classy, almost fifties retro visual style has weathered well, and László Kovács classic cinematography is put to good use in the films various comic set ups and large scale visual effects set pieces, as is Elmer Bernstein's classic score.What's little known about the film is that a T.V. series from the seventies ""The Ghost Busters"" already existed a decade earlier, although unrelated to the film except in name only, also some of the visual effects appear to be an extension of the effects created for the 1982 movie Poltergeist.Ultimately, the cast of Ghostbusters have gone on to do other things, although internet fandom has made noise about a new film for a decade or more, but none has actually come to light. Plans for a female-led Ghostbusters installment are in the works, but really, who cares? It would mean more to create something new and challenging, but the temptation to rework a successful franchise is too much for the for-profit investment model associated with Hollywood filmmaking.That said, for all of the fans/collectors/geeks/obsessives who love Ghostbusters, its official sequel from 1989 is flat in terms of fantasy OR comedy material, and its also surprising how many utterly hopeless films have been made with the names ""Ivan Reitman"" or ""Dan Ackroyd"" attached to them in the passing decades.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
80s Classic!,"What can be said about this movie thats not been said before?!...probably nothing to be honest, but I am such a fan of the movie I want to give the film the 10 star rating it deserves. At its best its possibly the wittiest script ever produced from Hollywood, with Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and the beautiful Sigourney Weaver all on top form. Bill Murray does steal the show with some of the best dialogue and one liners you will hear in a comedy. Everything about the movie is likable, the stories fun, the script and dialogue is pin sharp, the direction is spot on, the eighties special effects are top drawer and still look impressive to this day (give and take a couple of dodgy moments), the actors all give excellent performances from the A listers right down to the smallest of supporting roles. As a child the movie scared the s#*t out of me, but now watching it as an adult its just a wonderfully enjoyable timeless classic which is to be respected when you compare it to the total c#*p that comes out of Hollywood these days. The eighties were a time of fantastic blockbusters from Back to the Future to Raiders of the Lost Ark. I'm Glad a grew up in that cinematic era, but for me out of all the wonderful movies to come out of that time, Ghostbusters is by far my favourite, its the movie I will always go back to and stick in the DVD player and watch again and again....Anyone who has not seen it should head down to the local DVD store and buy a copy, not rent, BUY a copy as you will watch it many times over I'm sure. 10/10 TOP CLASS!",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Classic comedy,"From the beginning through the end, Ghostbusters was a classic comedy. The movie has a really good soundtrack, which includes a uniquely-excellent theme-song, with great characters and the whole movie is very funny.They start the movie with the guys working with the Department of Psychology and Pete is torturing a guy with apparent psychic abilities, possibly just to get himself a date with the girl that is getting everything wrong. Then, when they go to the ghost event in the library, it has things in there that are so funny that it makes you wonder how the actors actually kept straight faces when they were acting this.After they leave the University and start the business ""Ghostbusters"", the movie's action scenes seriously picks up. Especially when Pete first gives the guy from the EPA a hard time, after that failing in the later shutdown of their ghost storage facility, one of my favorite moments in all of this is where Pete finds Dana floating around her room saying she is the Gatekeeper and that Dana is gone.The movie had a good ending too, with their fight against Gozer and the Staypuft Marshmallow Man.

"The first time that I ever watched this movie, it scared me (don't worry; I later found it funny).","When I was about 3 and 4, I used to watch ""The Real Ghostbusters"" on TV. When I was 7, I noticed that my parents had a video tape that said ""Ghostbusters"". I asked them if I could watch it, and they said yes.The first thing that threw me off was that it was black and white. Moreover, it was clearly not a cartoon. The lion statue outside the library probably confused me further. Then, after the woman saw the ghost in the library basement, I could only interpret the movie as scary. Literally every scene invoked fear in me, especially the monster in the refrigerator. By the time that it was over, I thought to myself ""I'm never watching that again."" Then, when I was 9, my mom convinced me to give it a second chance. So, I watched ""Ghostbusters"" again, and I laughed my head off. I felt so idiotic for having gotten scared by something so hilarious. As everyone knows, the story has Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) and Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson) battling spooks in New York, and they have to go up against an ancient evil god. Among the supporting characters, one finds musician Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) and dorky Louis Tully (Rick Moranis).Probably what embarrassed me the most about getting scared by ""Ghostbusters"" was the fact that I didn't even interpret Louis Tully and his mishaps. The first time that I watched the movie, I literally did not realize that his character was there.Anyway, this is a veritable comedy classic. It was like nothing that had ever come before. With a catchy theme song (that I play every Halloween), this is a movie that's impossible not to like.Oh, and I should probably explain the ""black and white"" part. When my parents taped ""Ghostbusters"" off of the TV, it was in color on the TV but it came out black and white on the tape. My parents have never been able to figure that out, so their only explanation is that the tape was haunted. If so, then this was the perfect movie to record onto it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Ah! The 80's Nostalgic Ride,"""Ray, when someone asks if you're a god, you say YES""To put it simply, I've had a jolly good time. The story, the all-around narrative, it's basic stuff, remarkably simple; nothing too critical nor too serious.

No wonder, some of them have turned into immediate classics.As for the performances; everybody does their job respectably well. Even though there's not a single 'Standout Act' by mere definition; nevertheless, each of the cast members did precisely what they have been told to. No major objections from my end whatsoever.Speaking from a technical outlook, it's hard to believe this film is near three decades old! The practical effects, all the prosthetics partly look more productive (even better in some instances) than some of the modern-day CGI fests. Don't know about you, but I will always take sides with the practical crafts, as they look more authentic from where I sit.Now you guys must be wondering why such an unexpected trip down memory lane? Well, the truth is, as you guys already know there's a brand new Ghostbusters film that had just come up. And guess what?

You're Right. No human being would stack boxes like this. . .,"I knew a guy who once said that the only thing wrong with this film is that it wasn't the highest grossing movie of all time.

But it's not just that the film is well-made and technically proficient, it's also that it's obvious that a lot of time and energy went in to actually making it great. It's obvious from the opening at Columbia University that everyone involved with the production is having fun, and they want us to have just as much fun. Luckily, it works. I have never seen a film that is more fun, not to mention endlessly quotable, than ""Ghostbusters."" It's become a film that people go back to again and again for the simple aim of enjoying themselves. It's a film that makes people feel good and have a good time.

Awesome 80's classic!,"Before I saw the movie, I know that there was a cartoon. I was familiar with it, but what I did not know that there was a live-action movie. The movie is great, it is so cool and the theme song is so catchy. I knew that in the cartoon the Stay-Puffed Marshmallow Man was a nice guy with a dopey voice, but in the movie, he was a terrifying monster! My brother and I enjoyed Slimer as well. Just look at that big fat green blob of slime (inspired by Bluto from ""Animal House""). I always wanted to see the movie as a kid (despite the fact that I saw the cartoon and clips from the cartoon ""Muppet Babies""), but my parents wouldn't let me due to the creepy nature of it. I saw it on TV a few times whether it was on Bravo, Esquire, or VH-1. Finally I saw it on the big screen recently and it was like the time I took a time machine and went back to the 1980's! 1984 to be specific. Kind of like the time I saw the original ""King Kong"" at an old art house theater, was like going back in the 1930's. Specifically 1933. Speaking of which, there were a lot of scenes that paid homage to ""King Kong"". For instance, the giant temple with gate that opened with Gozor in it, looked like the gate with Ann Darrow being sacrificed before Kong's arrival. The Stay-Puffed Marshmallow Man climbing up the building and getting destroyed at the end was like the climax in the old 30's horror film. Apart from the films theme song, there was another cool song that screamed 80's, ""Saving the Day"" by Alessi. When my brother and I were very little, the cartoon was as popular as the movie. We had this coloring book called ""People in your Neighborhood"" (not related to ""Sesame Street""), and there was this page that showed firemen fighting fires with hoses shooting water. I went haywire coloring it all up and my brother said that looked like ""Ghostbusters"", so we ended up turning their hoses to zappers that shoot electricity we drew a ghost in it and he is loosing. My dad had a friend named Bob and he came to visit us when we were little and my brother called him Peter Venkman because he looked like the one in the cartoon than the film. OK, childhood memories aside, as for the special effects, they changed a lot over the past 30 years. I have been watching a lot of movies with special effects that used a ton of CGI such as those super hero movies and monsters such as The 2014 ""Godzilla"", ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"", ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"", ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"", ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and Michael Bay's ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"". People these days are wondering that if we are spoiling ourselves with a ton of CGI. Are we getting tired of it and do we miss practical effects? Seeing the Terror Dogs growl and leap made me think about it. Fortunately, J.J. Abrams is making ""Star Wars Episode Seven"" and he will use CGI and practical effects marry in this movie. James Rolfe of ""Angry Video Game Nerd"" fame made movie based on his web series and he used practical effect like those seen in old Japanese monster movies like the original ""Godzilla"". ""Jurassic World"", which is coming out next year, is said to have practical effects with the help of CGI. Bottom line: this is a great movie! I highly recommend it. Followed by an animated series and a sequel. Rated PG for violence, profanity, peril and a ton of scary scenes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
The Love and Hunger for Adventure,"There's so much to love about Ghostbusters. Whether it be simplistic yet stylised uniforms with the proton packs, the comedic chemistry between each cast member or the timeless special effects used throughout the film. Ghostbusters truly brings back the childhood love and hunger for adventure, companionship and many cool toys. I found some of the humour to have aged a little, though still very much enjoyable throughout. While the plot itself doesn't make for an award winning screenplay, it's undeniably a true science fantasy that is fun and loveable from start to finish.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Who you gonna call?,"Ghostbusters is one of those classic movies you can watch with friends or family and love, it was made in 1984 and you can tell by how it looks and feels.Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis as Venkman, Raymond, and Egon are funny and likable characters that we like following on their ghost busting missions.(Side note: I just wanted to say that I miss Harold Ramis who played Egon because he passed away February 24, 2014 and I think that is sad)The ghost effects are dated but you can tell they were groundbreaking back then, the ghost designs are cool looking and weird even though it looks fake.If there are people out there that haven't seen Ghostbusters, I recommend you watch it.

One of the greatest family/comedy movies ever made!,"Ghost Busters is quite possibly director Ivan Reitman's finest hour (and forty minutes)! Written by stars Harold Ramis and Dan Akroyd, Ghost Busters' is a rollercoaster ride of awesome special effects and intelligent humour which features the undeniable talents of Bill Murray as the sarcastic, but loveable character of Dr. Peter Venkman.After being thrown out of the University at which Ray Stantz (Akroyd), Egon Spengler (Ramis) and Peter Venkman are scientists and researchers they decide to put years of their research and thousands of dollars into starting up their own business  Ghost Busters. To begin with it seems that this risk will not pay off for them as they run out of money and Venkman's attempts at romance irritate their only customer, Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver). However this all changes when they get their first big job, after that they're the talk of the town! Unfortunately, there are some people who aren't very impressed with the Ghost Busters and seek to shut them down.This film stands out amongst the movies of the Eighties, and indeed the movies of all time, as being one of the greatest films in the history of cinema, and that is a reputation it quite rightly deserves. Unlike many of the movies I watched as a child this is one of the rare movies that I still love now as an adult. The jokes are still as funny, the action is still as exciting, the movie is still as watchable and the genius storytelling is still undeniable.This movie appeals to me on two levels. There are the immature and rather childish jokes and moments of the film that although are funny they require little thought. On top of this we have some rather intelligent and more adult jokes that as a child I didn't catch on to, as an adult it helps me appreciate the movie all the more. Bill Murray is at his best in this movie, delivering sharp and witty one-liners as if they just rolled off his tongue. Dan Akroyd also provides a great comedy element to the movie in the form of the brilliantly minded scientist, but socially slow Ray Stantz. Ray's behaviour provides much enjoyment and this accompanied by Bill Murray's excellent performance makes Ghost Busters' one of the greatest comedy films I've ever seen.Sigourney Weaver as Dana Barrett works perfectly as the romantic interest for Venkman and this is complimented by Weaver and Murray's performance on screen together. Despite the obvious absurdity of the central plotline the Dana/Peter relationship storyline works out very well and allows us to see a more sensitive side to Venkman. All of this helps in adding realism to an otherwise unrealistic film.The special effects are something else that must be praised, they have certainly stood the test of time and I would even venture to say they have stood up better than the Eighties other Special FX-Extravaganza Poltergeist'. I've heard a few negative remarks about them but I find them to be very effective even to this day.I have to say that I recommend this film to everyone, there is so much to it and the movie works on so many levels that it has to be seen. If you haven't seen this movie yet I would check it out as soon as possible because I think it is one of the greatest films of all time. My rating for Ghost Busters'  9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Murray is the loud mouth. Ramis is the nerdy brain. And Aykroyd is the nice guy to glue everybody together. On top of the three leads, they have Sigourney Weaver who is a viable partner for Murray to spar with. She's not just a dumb hottie.

"Great, but overrated","This film is one that had risen in fame as a classic of the 80s. And after watching it, I can see why. Compared to the other films from the 80s,the only other film that is along the same vein is probably Back to the Future. However, while others may call it a timeless classic, I beg to differ. For me, Back to the Future is significantly better. While this was a good film, especially for the 80s, in this day and age, it is just another film in a slew of sci fi comedies that have come out since then.However don't let my cynicism stop you from watching it. It's good, just not as good as it was made out to be. But if you take into account the context that made this a huge success, then you'll be able to enjoy it in its full glory.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Some crazy stuff, some funny guys. Who ya gonna call?","Combining big-budget special effects with irony and sarcasm-laden dialog, ""Ghostbusters"" is a one-of-a-kind sci-fi fantasy comedy as entertaining as it can get.The movie stars Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis, three graduates from the great schools of ""Saturday Night Live"", ""SCTV"" and ""National Lampoon"", as three ""scientists"" whose specialty is to detect and hunt down ghosts of all kinds. They form a team called the Ghostbusters and they offer their duties to whoever wanting to get ridden of a ghost.After some troublesome beginnings, the team quickly becomes very popular and is able to eradicate dozens of paranormal creatures from every corner of Manhattan. They are in such demand that they need to hire a fourth crew member, played by Ernie Hudson. However, their skills and their knowledge are soon going to be rudely tested when a destroyer god from the Babylonian era is getting ready to penetrate into our world and to spread chaos in a Judgment Day fashion.This kind of scenario could reminisce anybody of such disaster movies from the middle of the 20th century, monster movies such as ""King Kong"" and ""Godzilla"", or even contemporary blockbusters, filled with rumpus, destruction and special effects intended to terrify and provoke some panic. ""Ghostbusters"" is all of that at once, but it dissociates itself from the bunch in its own particular way.Instead of presenting itself as a drama, a thriller or an action flick, ""Ghostbusters"" is introduced as a heavy special FX comedy. Chimeric idea? Maybe. But the result is simply delectable, because of the quality of the special effects, but mainly because of the humor brought out by the stars of the picture, beginning with the master of irony, Bill Murray.Murray plays Dr. Peter Venkman, the unofficial leader of the group. His on-screen appearances are always delightful, his lines being almost always stamped with irony and impassive humor. Murray is very much at ease and he does whatever he wants in front of the camera.Murray's two accomplices (and the co-writers of this movie), Aykroyd and Ramis, are not relegated to oblivion anyway and, together with Murray, the three of them have a good lot of chemistry. At moments, they can become as funny as Murray is.Sigourney Weaver is also a part of the cast in ""Ghostbusters"". She plays a violinist who quickly realizes that her refrigerator could very be some kind of portal towards a parallel dimension. Rick Moranis plays her nerdish neighbor. Sometimes nice, sometimes unpleasant, it's actually very hard to really care about Moranis' character in this movie. It becomes easier when he is pursued and possessed by the Sumerian demons, but we actually do care much more about Sigourney Weaver in that situation.Ernie Hudson, a relatively underground actor, is fairly attractive as the fourth Ghostbuster. He represents somehow the link between the ghost trackers and the ordinary people.Nonetheless, the actors from ""Ghostbusters"" are generally overshadowed by the impressive special effects required for that kind of movie involving creatures from another world and innovative technology to hunt ghosts. But the actors find themselves rewarded from that move. Thus, we see ""proton packs"" with extremely dangerous, but extremely convincing beams. We also see ghosts that are both frightening and funny, the green wiener-eating ""Slimer"" being the best example.But how could we forget the unforgettable climax starring the most unlikely destroyer in New York City history: the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man? It is without any doubt the most famous scene of the whole picture and it's not without reason. His arrival unleashes the greatest panic attack from the movie's extras, because of his menacing stature. But in the viewers' case, they can't help themselves from smiling and laughing when they see that surreal giant walking in the streets of Manhattan, even if they know that this monster is not so much different from Godzilla, save for the hideous and repulsing appearance.So ""Ghostbusters"" is technically innovating, comically revealing, but it's globally some really tasty entertainment that everybody will be able to appreciate. Everyone will be able to find at least one element that will satisfy them. Those who love spectacle and eye-popping sequences will be delighted by the special effects. Others will respond to Bill Murray's lines with an inescapable smile. And let's not forget the eponymous theme song from Ray Parker, Jr. that will play in the heads of people long after they've seen the film.So, twenty-five years later, we can still watch ""Ghostbusters"" without telling ourselves that this picture comes from another era. The majority of the special effects have aged well, even if some of the moves from the demonic dogs begin to look like those created by Ray Harryhausen for ""The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms"". So, it's still easy to love the movie, just like if it was just being released.Since the first silent movies of the early 20th century, there have been a lot of comedies that were created. But among those which tried to insert big-budget special effects to counterbalance their comic moments, ""Ghostbusters"" is among the best, if it's not THE best. It's really some pure crazy fun.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

After initial difficulties their popularity skyrockets after ridding a hotel of a ghastly nuisance. However, it isn't long before an ancient evil, prophesied by the Baylonians, threatens to make its way into our world through New York City. That's when things really heat up.The result is a ridiculously entertaining movie that's part serious, part funny, but in the end, just seriously funny. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, and the whole cast, but especially Murray, give highly amusing performances under an admittedly impressive (for those days) direction by Ivan Reitman. By now, acting for blue screen and managing multiple locations in the form of sound stages comes with the territory for making a spectacle science fiction fare, but that art we now take for granted wasn't nearly as developed in 1984 and this film does a really good job. Featuring the finest in pre-digital special effects, whose limitations are quite apparent, but that is all part of the fun in watching a classic.Also, of note, is the story, which is quite well thought out and developed for a goofy movie like this. While it has an overall lighthearted and amusing appeal throughout, many of the elements are things that would make ""weird fiction"" master H.P. Lovecraft proud. It is just genre bending fun for all. 8/10Rated PG for scary stuff and mild profanity",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Iffy effects, good comedy, great Murray  probably remembered as being better than it is","Three scientists at Columbia University lose their funding and are kicked out of their premises.  A contact with a ghost puts them onto a business idea of operating as `ghost busters' in new York.  They make the equipment and set up shop in an old firestation.  With their first customer comes fame and roaring business.  However one of their customers is reporting something about Gorzer and the group realise that she may be the focus of a bigger supernatural phenomenon.Everyone who saw this when it came out will have fond memories of it  be it the comedy, the `great' effects or just the cheesy wonderful theme song.  It was a great blockbuster at the time but it hasn't dated that well in some respects.  However overall it is still fun to watch.  The plot is average at best but allows for plenty of comedy and action  which is all you want really isn't it?The bits that have dated are naturally the effects  the beastly dogs are pretty ropy to say the least but are forgivable.  This is more than made up for by the energy it has and the comedy.  The film is simply fun to watch  it may not be a classic but it is enjoyable and will make you smile.  Most of this is due to Murray (who replaced Belushi who the role was meant for). Murray has all the best lines and has the most fun character.  Aykroyd is a close second but Ramis is much better behind the camera.Support from Weaver, Moranis, Potts and Atherton are all good and the ghosts are enjoyable if a bit dodgy. Poor Hudson looks as out of place at times as he apparently felt.  He isn't part of the trio and strugged off-screen to fit in, while onscreen his distance is evident with him slightly off to the side on many occasions.Overall many remember it to be better than it is because we saw it as children.  Revisiting it as an adult may bruise those memories but I was relived to find that it was still very enjoyable to watch despite being a bit more superficial than I noticed back in 84!",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Dr. Venkmen as Date Rapist?,"Does anyone else find it strange that Dr. Peter Venkman, while on his first date with Dana, just happened to have on his person 300cc's of Thorazine? Dr. Venkman first arrives at Dana Barrett's apartment to find she has been imbued with the spirit of Gozer and now is calling herself the ""Gate Keeper"" and is awaiting the arrival of the ""Key Master"". There is a scene that shows her animal tendencies (floating above the bed, panting rapidly, deep and growling voice). Then the scene cuts away and returns to a phone call between Peter and Egon. Peter Venkman states that he injects her with the dosage during a phone call with Egon.So we have to assume, since Dr. Peter Venkman did not show up with a briefcase, medical bag, or any other piece of science kit or gear, that he showed up to Dana Barrett's apartment with a syringe filled with 300cc's of Thorazine in the breast pocket of his blazer.I could see a surgeon walking around with a set of scalpels or clamps in case he or she is called upon to perform an emergency appendectomy on the street or other minor surgeries in life or death situations, but Dr. Peter Venkman is a psychologist/parapsychologist. Walking around with a set of syringes filled with sedatives is just plain creepy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"""It's not the *girl*, Peter, it's the *building*.""","Still very much a classic and favorite of mine, after all these years. Bill Murray is still the film's resident scene stealer.His Peter Venkman is a fantastically sardonic opportunist, he falls just short of being both nasty & sleazy. He spends half of the film trying to get Sigourney Weaver's Dana Barrett into bed. ""I'll take Miss Barret back to her apartment and check her out."" The lethargic, laid-back manner with which he greets unimaginable confrontations provides some of the film's best moments: particularly his first 'contact' with ""Slimer"" and of course the scenes at a possessed Dana's apartment. "" I make it a rule never to get involved with possessed people.......Actually, it's more of a guideline than a rule..."" Another strength of the film is the way it balances the comedy and terror.

Fun but not funny,"This is the first time I am watching a Ghostbusters movie. I am 23 years old which means that I was born many years after the movie was released(1984) . This is movie is definitely out of my time so I am not really sure if I can evaluate it properly but I am going to try.
The movie was fun but not funny. It was TOO MUCH if you understand what I am saying. The plot is that three parapsychologist professors get fired from the university that they work with so they take loan and start a business to catch(busts) ghosts(duh!)(by the way noone in this city seems too upset that ghosts are real). I want to be real with you I loved Bill Murray in this movie and I personally think he is the reason that the movie was such a big hit I cant say the same for the rest of the cast tho. They are too corny for me , they try to much to be funny and they just don't succeed except Rick Moranis's character the only time that I laughed is when he was on the screen. The plot moves really fast and it didn't make any sense whatsoever. The romance between Bill Murray's character and Sigourney Weaver's its too linear(she doesn't like him then he becomes famous now she does) . The phrase ""don't cross the streams"" will be in my head for ever for some reason. The movie was made to make people laugh(i didn't) but some people will , maybe am not the Ghostbusters type of guy. Music was a big one, I don't know if liked the main song (Who you gonna call.. GHOSTBUSTERS) or I am to brainwashed from all these years that I am hearing it from the other type of media but I really REALLY liked it.

A massively underrated masterpiece,"""Ghostbusters"" is just one of those movies that you must have seen at least once in your life. Although I can't think of a person who hasn't already. Lot's of people grew up with this movie and lot's of people will remain to, cause it's a movie that just never will be outdated, the entertainment value is just too high for that to happen.I think the power of ""Ghostbusters"" are the main characters and the actors that portray them. Bill Murray is hilarious as always and Dan Aykroyd shows why he was one of the greatest comedians of the 80's. William Atherton was wonderful as 'villain' and Rick Moranis does what he can do best; play the nerdy loser. The cast is just simply perfect and I haven't even mentioned Sigourney Weaver, Harold Ramis, Annie Potts or Ernie Hudson yet.The music is also spot on perfect. No, I'm not just talking about the Ray Parker Jr. theme song but mainly about the Elmer Bernstein soundtrack which in my opinion is underrated.The movie is mainly just fun to watch and is highly entertaining and is filled with some wonderful and memorable moments. The early special effects look acceptable but by todays standards they look pretty fake at times.Lot's of people always praise the ending, not I however. I don't really like the ending, never did really. Sure the huge marshmallow man is just fantastic and highly original but the whole Gozer thing is just a bit underused maybe. I have the feeling that the movie's ending could have been done way more spectacular. For some reason it doesn't really blend in with the rest of the movie.Yet ""Ghostbusters"" remains one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen and is one of those movie's I have fond childhood memories of.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

The Dead Vs. The Deadpan,"What happens when a guy finds himself losing the woman he loves to a bloodthirsty Sumerian god? Can a trio of determined men capture a Class-5 full-roaming vapor without destroying a hotel ballroom? Is ""crossing the streams"" dangerous to one's health?If you are like millions of other people, you already know the answers to these and other questions. A giant comedy smash in its day, ""Ghostbusters"" is still a lot of fun, and perhaps the most successful cinematic showcase for veterans of ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""SCTV."" While not as hilarious or as scary as its reputation suggests, ""Ghostbusters"" is clever and amusing and goes by fast.The star of the show, Bill Murray, plays Peter Venkman, a university professor we meet playing a shady psychic shell game in order to score some time with a young lovely. When forced to relocate, he and his friends Egon (Harold Ramis) and Ray (Dan Aykroyd) set to work as freelance spook catchers, fortunately for them just as the the Big Apple is about to be swallowed by the gates of hell.""We could really bust some heads, in a spiritual sense of course,"" Ray notes.The casting really brings out the best in the movie. Sigourney Weaver as the imperiled love interest Dana brings the right snark to her role, comparing Venkman to a ""game show host"" with a withering stare as he attempts (hilariously) to put the moves on her. Rick Moranis, like Ramis from ""SCTV"", is a nerdy accountant who chases after Dana like a dog, then as a dog. He throws tax-deductible parties, then brags to his guests: ""I'm giving this whole thing as a promotional expense...that's why I invited clients instead of friends."" And then there's William Atherton's nasty EPA official Walter Peck, sneering wonderfully at it all.As a fan of the old ""Saturday Night Live"", I guess I wanted more chemistry from the classic SNL cornerstones here, Murray and Aykroyd. Instead, Aykroyd doesn't do much to establish himself. Even though he concepted and wrote the film, his character is even less interesting than the fourth Ghostbuster, recruit Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson), who is a bit of a bystander in this film though he does have one great line. ""If someone asks you if you're a god, you say 'Yes'!""Murray of course gets all the best lines, delivered in his signature deadpan style, like ""Back off, man, I'm a scientist"" or ""Generally you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance."" Director Ivan Reitman leaves Murray plenty of space in-between the special effects to establish a ""Ghostbusters"" voice; even if to me it seems at times more of a collection of catch phrases, I see Reitman giving the film enough shape and subtlety to make those catch phrases click.Yes, the effects are dated, and there are odd moments that don't connect (Ray being seduced out of nowhere by a ghost, for example). Still, ""Ghostbusters"" is a smart genre-bender with the ability to fly through generations like that Slimer ghost goes through walls.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Anyway you slice it...a comedy classic...,"GHOSTBUSTERS was a smashing and innovative 1984 comedy that was the perfect blending of clever comedy, eye-popping special effects, and supernatural silliness that was one of the biggest box office smashes of the year and deservedly so. Three professors doing college research on the supernatural lose their funding and decide to go into business for themselves as paranormal investigators. Bill Murray towers over all with his near perfect comic performance as Dr. Peter Venkman, a sort of wise ass guy who doesn't take this ghostbusting stuff seriously until they start making real money. Dan Aykroyd is a charmer as Ray, ""the heart of the Ghostbusters"" and Harold Ramis, who would gain greater fame as a director, generates real laughs here as Egon (""I collect spores, moles, and fungus."") Sigourney Weaver makes an intelligent and refreshing damsel in distress and Rick Moranis steals every scene he's in as Weaver's nerdy neighbor who also becomes part of the story as we learn the apartment building where Weaver and Moranis live is on top of some ancient burial ground. Annie Potts (DESIGNING WOMEN) also scores as the guys' secretary and William Atherton is funny as an EPA exec out to ruin the Ghostbusters. But it is mostly Murray's beautifully flippant performance laid against some awesome (for 1984) special effects that made this movie work. It even has a very catchy title tune that became a top ten smash for Ray Parker, Jr. An instant comedy classic and deservedly so.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Ghostbusters: Less Good Than it Should Be,"Hardly needing any sort of introduction, Ghostbusters is a classic film which is celebrated as one of the best known and most loved comedies in film history.For those exceptional few of you who aren't aware, it's about a team of three college psychology professors who, when they're thrown out of their jobs, establish a business hunting down and capturing ghosts together. A strange ancient legend comes to bear and the laughs roll off amidst the action.It's not hard to see the lasting appeal of this film, the many quirky lines coming primarily from the ever wonderful Bill Murray. There's plenty of jostling and joking between the Ghostbusters, the Murray/Aykroyd dynamic being particularly effective. Although the jokes are effective, and the laughs are certainly many, there's something lacking in the film and I found myself somewhat disappointed in the face of this imposing legacy. It's not that it's a bad film, certainly not, there aren't even a huge number of flaws. The humour works well, and there are little to no jokes which fail entirely. That said, it feels less good than it should be. Perhaps, my time rather after Ghostbusters', it's just that bit too dated to be particular appealing to my comedy tastes. The problem lies primarily in the nature of the laughs; none entirely memorable or strong. Not once was I struggling for breath, more chuckling lightly at the funny but never hilarious dialogue. Additionally, Murray's upfront affection always seemed very strange to me, though this impacts little on the film.Though graced with clever writing, rapid-fire dialogue, and fine acting, Ghostbusters simply seems lacking, and the majority of the jokes are more smileworthy than laughworthy. Perfectly good for a chuckle though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
An Honest Review,"Like my review of Footloose, this is a classic, everyone has seen it, everyone loves it. It's one of those movies that came from your childhood and lasts well into the adult manboy years.So, we're going to do a comparison with the remake.For starters..the Ghostbusters plays it straight. The comedy is presented like a drama and that is usually the absolute best way to do comedy...straight.And conversely the remake is just sort of over the top. And when comedies try that hard to be comedies, they stop being funny.Another part would be scene length. And again, playing it straight, the opening of 1984 is short and honestly kind of scary......when the remake drags on and deals with characters that honestly have nothing else to do with the film but introduce it. You lose interest sort of fast.And this can be seen again with the humor. The introduction of the car in the remake is prime example. Pulls up with a hearse, someone makes a joke about checking to see if there is a body in there.......the scene SHOULD stop when they look at the hearse and cut away to a different scene. But the remake drags on and the joke loses momentum and falls flat when it COULD have been an easy laugh.Conversely in 1984 you have jokes like the Twinkie that ends with ""tell him about the Twinkie"" and it is funny because it doesn't drag on in an effort to be funny. The same can be said about testing the proton packs, the joke ends fast enough for it to actually be funny.And then there is the script and direction, the 1984 version stuck to it and made sure everything was tight, even when it was improvised, it wasn't allowed to get out of control.But the remake the actors took control and the improvisation went on too long, even with scenes being cut.So what you have is a tight and fast film that is a comedy played straight like it should be...and one that everyone knows and loves because of it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Followed by a equally great ""Ghostbusters 2"".One thing that always gets my attention is the soundtrack and music in the film. the theme song really gets you cheering for the guys, and the other music throughout the film is spot on. One day i hope to see this movie on the big screen, till then i'll just be playing my DVD over and over and over again...I am a Ghostbuster for life!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Murray at his best!,"Ghostbusters was a big hit back in '84, as was the smash pop hit song. Seeing it now, probably some thirty years after I saw it for the last time, I still enjoyed it immensely. Sure, it is a typical 80s film that includes all the usual 80s elements (hello there, montage scene, bad clothing and horrible haircuts) that seem corny now. But the glue that holds it all together (now and probably back in '84 as well) is the absolute dead-pan comedy genius Bill Murray. He steals every single scene he is in, and thankfully he is in a lot of scenes. It should be called Bill Murray and the Ghostbusters!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Terribly overrated - Boring,"Terribly overrated movie borrowing from the Sci-Fi influences from its time and before. Clunky writing, horrible acting by Bill Murray. Just FYI, I love older movies and when I watched Back to the Future for the first time recently, I loved it and clapped out loud. This was so awful I would boo aloud. The writing was not good and things felt forced from beginning to end.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Who You Gonna Call?,"When you've got uninvited paranormal guests or if you've accidentally intruded on them if you've acquired some haunted living space this film answers the question. Just who you going to call? Ghost Busters.It all begins innocently enough, parapsychologist Bill Murray has lost his grant money, his university won't let him stay on to conduct all kinds of experimentation. What to do?In Ghost Busters Bill Murray takes his knowledge and with a collection of some interesting colleagues, Dan Ackroyd, Harold Ramis, and Ernie Hudson forms his own outfit, the Ghost Busters. If you've got intruders from another dimension, they guarantee to get rid of them. They have a first interesting call from the public library at Bryant Park, that's a shakedown cruise for our heroes.But the real challenge comes from Sigourney Weaver who has all kinds of weird visitors including an ancient Hittite Goddess who emanates right from her refrigerator. That one Murray is going to give his personal attention.Ghost Busters busted a whole lot of box office back in the day and with good reason. It's a rollickingly funny comedy that doesn't quite come down to the level of Police Academy movies. These comedy veterans from the small screen know their business and they integrate their own personalities into a fine comic unit. A lot like the Crazy Gang comedies from the UK back in the day.Ghost Busters got two Oscar nominations for Special Effects and for its catchy title song. It's one of those you can't get out of your head once you've seen the film. In fact more than in most films, the song itself almost becomes a character in the film.It's one of the funniest films in the Eighties and it's one of those that spawned an equally funny sequel. Can't go wrong with either of them.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
My review for Ghostbusters,"For the first time in my life, I watched this film a few weeks ago, and what did I think of it? Well, I can say that I enjoyed this film.I liked the characters - how they acted, it was funny and entertaining.I also enjoyed that the city was under attack by a powerful force, and it was up to the Ghostbusters to stop the evil.And yes, the classic music that everyone already knows, is still catchy to this day.My final thoughts:This was a fun movie and I think you would like it. Another great classic film from the 80s.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Someone check me on this...,"My calculations are quick and dirty, but as far as I can figure, a 35' Twinkie would weigh FAR more than 600lbs.If the average normal Twinkie is 4"" long x 1.25"" wide x 1.25"" tall, and weighs 43 grams (0.0947988 pounds), then a 35' Twinkie would be about 11' high and 11' tall. The volume of such a Twinkie would hold approx. 1,157,625 normal Twinkies.According to http://www.nutritional-information.info/item54852.aspx , one Hostess Twinkie weighs 43 grams, or 0.0947988 pounds.

Older is Better,"The remake of Ghostbusters was much anticipated, but it can never hold a light to the triumph of the original Ghostbusters. Any way you look at it, the original version of Ghostbusters is a classic.The acting was great, and coming from a generation of comics that knew what they were doing, much better than the remake. The script was superb, very fresh and funny. The action was good too, along with special effects.Truly one of the finest comedy films of the 1980s. One of Bill Murrays best performances, aside from What About Bob?. Aykroyd and Ramis, who also wrote the script were great together.

"After all the hype, is that it?","There was a lot of hype for this film but when I saw it all I could think of was ""Is that it?""So what's good?The cast for this is great, four guys (SNL crew), they all bounce of each other both excelently and especialy naturaly, they are without doubt the best part of this film. All of the supporting cast is good as well making the most of what they are working with.
Visual Humour is the well done here with the final big bad being awsome.So what's not so good?The humour is hit and miss although it does hit more often than miss there where long pauses where you wait for the funny and well, it just isnt. After Stripes I'm afraid Ghostbusters was a little too bland & safe with many of its jokes in the theatre being predictable and just not working (no one laughed).I mentioned the visual comedy was well done but was all wasted as all of it was revealed by the films trailer, so no where as impactfull as it could have been. Sadly Hollywood just doesnt know how to cut a trailer anymore.A horror comedy should be scary as well, the opening scene in the library delivered but thats it, the rest even for the 1980's was a bit of a yawn. The effects where well passable for 1984 but now? oh dear!Finally just as something began happening the film kind of ended as there isnt that much of a story.Despite all the issues I enjoyed it more than I was bored but maybe it was all the hype at the time that spoiled it all (and the trailer showing too much as usual)This is a good film but thats all.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Ghostbusters,"I was always put off watching this film at the time because I positively loathed the Ray Parker Jnr. Theme song. It drove me mad! Finally, though, I sat down and watched and wondered what on earth all the fuss was about. It all centres around three curious geeky academics who find themselves devoid of funding, so they acquire an old fire station and set up shop as a sort of paranormal police force - hunting down colourful beasties from other dimensions. Surprisingly, there doesn't appear to much shortage of work for Messrs ""Venkman"" (Bill Murray); ""Stantz"" (Dan Aykroyd) and ""Spengler"" (Harold Ramis). Less surprisingly, the authorities decide they are certifiable and to jail they go. Luckily for them, though - ""Gozer"" an all-powerful and malevolent Hittite deity descends on the city and the mayor calls on them to save their souls. Can they save the day? To be fair, the ensemble cast work really well together with the scene-stealing, hapless, Rick Moranis ""Tully"" on great form and Annie Potts's ""Janine"" adding value too. Quite what Sigourney Weaver was there for, though, is anyone's guess and I found the ghost-busting visual effects just a bit too basic and repetitive. I know it isn't fair to watch 1984 sci-fi with 2022 eyes, but this also purports to be comedy and the humour I found to be so in-your-face and simplistic that after ten minutes I was expecting Harold Lloyd or Charlie Chaplin to show up. It is entertaining enough, and passes the time amiably - but like so many other movies that have acquired ""cult"" status, I think this film of it's time, and that time has long since passed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Who you gonna call? ""Ghostbusters""! One of the best comedy and sci-fi films of all time a feel good and well remembered film!","Growing up as a small kid in the early and mid 80's I remember when this film came out and the crazy feel and fever it started. It had everyone going around saying in 1984 ""Who you gonna Call""? ""Ghostbusters""! And clearly without a doubt 1984's ""Ghostbusters"" was one of the most memorable and better known films of the 1980's, as it's a sci-fi comedy that's feel good and well remembered. As it was well written with smarts and wit still the funny one liners and comedic parts are often overshadowed by the well remembered ghosts(green ghost slimmer) and monsters(the stay puff marshmallow man) of the film.Also well directed by Ivan Reitman the plot is pretty good as it is set in New York City and it features three college professors of parapsychology named Dr. Venkman(Bill Murray)Dr. Stanz(Dan Aykroyd) and Dr. Spengler(Harold Ramis)who all of a sudden find themselves out of a job as the university starts to downsize as they have cut their study department due to lack of interest and the mid 80's recession of the bad economy. Yet never fear an ideal has sprung to mind just like it did with all great minds from Einstein to Gallo, and Pluto the trio decide to open up a business and go the entrepreneurial route as they specialize in everything from chasing ghosts and unappetizing apparitions. Also a good supporting role is given from the elegant and classy Sigourney Weaver as Dana Barret a single woman who even discovers her apartment's refrigerator door has became the door for the gates of hell! And thru the film it's interesting and memorable with funny one liners and chase scenes of strange ghost, yet thru it all the ""Ghostbusters"" will conquer all of New York City from the ghastly ghost and make it safe again in this very funny haunting action comedy. Well remembered film at a time that features the comedy trio of Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis in their prime and in top form and the lovable and cute ghost like green slimmer and stay puff are very memorable images of joy and fun. Overall one of the better feel good comedy films of the 80's a real treat.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Comedy which already seemed dated at the time.,"I never really got into this one originally and on a recent revisit found the jokes pretty unfunny and the style horribly dated.

Overrated,"Honestly, Ghostbusters strikes me as yet another movie that's only popular to due a combination of nostalgia and group-think, common with many 80s films.I watched this for the first time and I was largely unimpressed. The plot is sloppy (and I know it's a comedy, it doesn't have to be airtight), the character development is non-existent, and the *comedy*, which should be the biggest feature, is completely lacking. I did not laugh once in this entire film.It was a somewhat entertaining film, but it wasn't great. I don't plan on watching it again.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
A Classic,"I love this movie. A total Classic. Made my 7 yr old son watch it as one of my favorite movies as a child. This movie was made when I was 2 years old. My son born in 2003 loves it now in 2011. That's a classic. Nick at Night premiered it last night for the first time & Ghost Busters too is now on Comcast on Demand for Free (March 2011).I love Bill Murray in this movie. All of these men are comic genius. Seriously though, who doesn't think Dan Akroyd is great. He not only was a main player in the cast but also behind the scenes, was a writer.I love the bad ass attitudes the guys portray on their rise to fame while ghost busting. I have heard rumors of another Ghost Busters in the making. If these guys hadn't decided to do Ghostbusters 3, I was seriously considering a screenplay for a remake,,,everything else was remade. I'm happy to know that Ghostbuster will once again be in the headlines.MUST SEE THIS MOVIE!!! At least once every few years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
One of the Funnest movies ever,"""Human Sacrifice, Dogs and Cats living together, MASS HYSTERIA"" said one Peter Venkman.  And that could pretty much describe this goofy comedy from the great minds of Dan Akroyd and Harold Ramis.But the plot is pretty interesting also.  It shows a trio of scientists (funny ones at that including Bill Murray in one of his best roles) turn from college rejects to the biggest hit in New York by being 'profesional paranormal investigators and eliminators' (AKA- Ghostbusters).  There are plenty of funny parts, but they are overshadowed by parts of ridiculous (yet remarkable) effects which showcase ghosts of plenty.But thanks to great writing, great directing (Ivan reitman), and great acting, this film gets to be a great example of comedy in it's finest form and It's one of the best films of the 80's as well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Another Bill Murray classic,"I can't let that other review sit here alone, especially when he doesn't know what he's talking about.  GhostBusters was a great movie.  Everyone who is old enough has seen this movie and is filled with great, quietly comic performances.  Bill Murray, Akroyd, Ramis fill the bill just right.  This shouldn't have been serious, Ivan Reitman doesn't write serious.  If you want slapstick, outlandish comedy, this isn't your movie, but then Bill Murray movies never are. If you don't like Bill Murray, who makes the movie, don't bother to pick this one up. Truly worth a watch and, usually, a buy. 3 out of 4 stars. And it keeps telling me i need one more line, so here is my final line.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Nothing like it,"Ghostbusters is truly lightning in a bottle. It's a film that merges so many different ideas together into a cohesive whole whilst remaining a comedy first and foremost, and a very funny one at that. The carefree attitude really keeps it on its toes, preventing it from getting bogged down in too much exposition and world building.The central trio of Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis are perfect together, bouncing off each other flawlessly. Each of them creates a character that offers something different to the rest and makes the comedy all the better for it. Ernie Hudson arrives later on and wastes no time adding to the group dynamic, he's a natural fit.Ivan Reitman's direction ensures things are always moving and leaves some great details in the background, as well as some memorable moments from the background extras. Elmer Bernstein's score moves between being frantic, fun, and ominous for the few moments played straight plus Ray Parker, Jr. Delivered an all timer of a title song.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Chews all the stereotypes of horror comedy by generalising the idea amongst civilians,"Ghostbusters (1984) :
Brief Review -Chews all the stereotypes of horror comedy by generalising the idea amongst civilians. In any horror comedy from the old days, we would never see civilians getting involved with the main theme or the supernatural stuff. Ivan Reitman's Ghostbuster broke that stereotype. It immersed commoners in the story and made it public-friendly. With that Ghostbuster song running in the background and the crowd cheering for the ghostbusters, you can actually feel the vibe. One more thing is that when you think about a horror comedy, you actually expect the comedy to be very hysterical and full of gags. Ghostbusters' humour is quite on the ground in that sense. No forced dumpers, no extreme facial expressions of jokes-it's all about keeping it a healthy little comedy and letting the situations do the work of creating a solid mix of supernatural and comedy. Written by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis, the film sees three eccentric parapsychologists starting a ghost-busting business in New York City. Soon they start getting famous and become celebrities. However, they are unaware of the upcoming disaster that has to go with their first-ever client's incomplete operation. Using biblical features to define ""rise of the dead' and ""judgement day"" sounded so cutely funny here. The film has a superb screenplay that lasts for about 100 minutes, a standard runtime in my opinion. Bill Murray was a Playboy scientist specially designed for female audiences, while Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis played scientific chatterboxes. Sigourney Weaver looked sexy in some scenes but didn't really add much to the film. Annie Potts and Rick Moranis have been satisfying. Ivan Reitman's supernatural comedy is a genuine entertainer, even though it falls short of some high-class tags.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
I was expecting a more serious film about Ghostbusting,"I had never seen Ghostbusters before but had always heard good things. It was much sillier than I anticipated. I expected more consistent worldbuilding, but instead it felt random and unpredictable. The characters were very funny - particularly Bill Murray and Rick Moranis - but I never felt sufficiently grounded in their reality to engage with the broader plot. Also, the visuals are shockingly dated.My daughter loved it, but I was a bit disappointed (relative to high expectations).",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
How can you not like Ghostbusters?,"Ok, so I sound a little obsessed, but Ghostbusters is probably one of the better movies and most catchy and popular movie franchises out there. Honestly, who didn't want to be a Ghostbuster when they were younger?  It seems like it would've been so cool to go and use a proton pack and trap ghosts, spooks and all that.  The sci-fi factor alone was awesome.And it was very funny.  You couldn't have a better cast(with the exception of perhaps adding John Belushi like that had originally intended).  The comedic chemistry between the four of them was flawless, and each of their personalities molded together for perfect timing and very much enjoyment. Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis were ingenious in, and writing the film, and Bill Murray couldn't have been funnier.  Even Ernie Hudson added a much needed balance to the original 3 Ghostbusters.     The other popular actors in the movie were very enjoyable to watch as well.And yeah, so the special effects looked fake...for 2004.  Back then, it was awesome, and the movie wouldn't be the same without them.The movie made perfect sense for the time and place and still rocks to watch today.  It's a pure classic that will hopefully be revived again and again in generations to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Never has been a movie premise so perfectly encapsulated in its title.,"Turns out I watched this again some time ago, and I literally had fun like it was my first viewing. Ghostbusters is a classic that no matter how many times you've watch it, and know all the lines, it still somehow feels fresh and full of genuine charm. Sure most of its special effects are incredibly dated, but they are also part of the allure. We cannot take the nostalgia factor out of the equation, since it irrevocably appeals to us in that vein.Full of iconic scenes, costumes, dialogues, lines, special effects, the giant Marshmallow Man, and even the Ghostbusters logo have managed to remain in people's collective memory since the year it premiered. Not many motion pictures can do that, so with that in mind, it's really important to get a proper perspective of the film to truly appreciate it. And then, when you watch it, you absolutely understand the magic behind it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Dare I be so controversial as to say that this film is a tad overrated?,"Don't get me wrong I had a good time watching this movie. It's fun, has an adventurous plot, has some incredibly iconic cinema (the song, the costumes, the car), but I was left a little underwhelmed.In a way I feel like the essence of this movie and its cultural footprint are more impressive than the film itself.The laughs didn't hit the mark for me, which is in no small part down to Bill Murray. I know people love him but I find the sarcastic and miserable style of his performances to be such a chore (see Groundhog day for the exact same thing). As a lot of humour rested on his shoulders that side of things was a let down. I also think that the greatly funny Dan Aykroyd was underused.Also was it scary? I've seen people describe it as a genuinely scary film but not for me. Maybe in the 80s but watching this for the first time in 2021 it didn't feel very scary at all.The plot is the film's greatest strength. It is goofy, energetic, stupid, fun, creepy. There's lots to enjoy and even though the third act maybe got a bit out of hand in my opinion, I still really liked it.I do find it interesting that this film is hailed as such a classic and revered by so many. I thought it was perfectly fun but given all the discourse around it I was expecting something more akin to Back to the Future in terms of quality. A fun film, and worth watching purely to indulge in the iconic moments of which there are plenty, but you can't hang a film purely of iconic imagery.A strong 7/10 but nothing more.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

A Huge Part Of My Childhood & My Heart!!! Ivan Reitman Thank You.,"GHOSTBUSTERS is obviously one of the most fun movies ever, up there with Classic's like Men In Black & BeetleJuice, for example. I adore Ghostbusters & i was born in 1984 when it was released so its a special film to me. I do love Ghostbusters but gotta be true to myself, i do prefer it's underrated sequel GHOSTBUSTERS 2!!! The river of slime is a unique & so relevant ""Villain"" for all ages. The music to this 1984 Classic is beautiful & in my mind & heart forever, some films are so important at shaping someone's character. The music score is also burned into my subconscious as is the cinematography, truly a Masterpiece. I was raised by movies, especially the Ghostbusters films 1&2, those two movies are a part of my DNA. The magic of those 80's Ghostbusters films doesn't go away it stays with you for life. Ghostbusters 1&2 are timeless Classic's & the greatest films of the greatest decade ever, the 80's!!!Both Ghostbusters films had such a huge impact on me from such a young age, they're magical to me in a away & films that hold such a strong connection with me. Ghostbusters is in my blood lol, Ghostbusters was a video I watched constantly as a little kid right up to manhood, all my life I've watched that 80's Masterpiece. Also its super underrated, yet just as great, sequel Ghostbusters 2 was my first cinema experience when i was about 5!!! Safe to say that Ghostbusters 1&2 mean a lot to me. I loved superb stuff because of the two Ghostbusters movies, & BeetleJuice.I love both movies, & both are a huge part of why i love movies.Some movies just are apart of your movie loving DNA, here's some of mine: BeetleJuice, Jaws 1&2, Ghostbusters 1&2, Predator 1&2, Terminator 1&2, 48 hrs 1&2, Robocop 1&2, MIB 1&2, Transformers the movie, Toy Story, Lethal Weapon 1&2 & more.But Ghostbusters 2 was the first ever movie i saw at the Cinema & my first memories of that Cinema experience is burned into my brain. Ghostbusters 2, even with it's faults, is a misunderstood Masterpiece in my opinion. But i totally understand why the first 1984 original is hailed as the Masterpiece, the ultimate 80's Classic.Legendary Director Ivan Reitman was as much a legend to me as any actor was in those Classic films, as he directed them & i dug his sense of humour, lovable characters & good-hearted nature of his films.I also grew up on his Twins, Kindergarten Cop, Junior & Stripes.GHOSTBUSTERS has all great elments with it's
Cinematography, music, cast,special effects & locations of New York City are absolutely iconic & burned into my mind since being tiny,i have so much Nostalgia & love for these Ghostbusters movie's.I've been obsessed with Ghostbusters all my life & adore the characters who feel like family to me & everytime i watch these film's it's like seeing old friends again. Also Ghostbusters is defensive a New York movie & the film that got me loving the gritty & dark look of 1980's New York City in movies. Ghostbusters 1&2 are ingrained in me & i adore both films & the franchise, i loved the ""Girls Ghostbusters"" that movie is ridiculously underrated & a great movie in it's own right.Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) will always be my favourite character in the franchise followed by Ernie Hudson as Winston Zeddemore.I grew up watching the animated series The Real Ghostbusters, Extreme Ghostbusters, i collected all the Action figures & watched both FILMS on video over & over growing up,so yes i grew up on Ghostbusters.This movie made me fall in love with New York City for how it looks on screen & the beautiful & detailed cinematography, both films look beautiful!!!I could go on & on about my love for Ghostbusters & still never completely explain it lol, the truth is Ghostbusters & it's characters touched something in me at a young age like most fans & never let go!!!Ghostbusters opened my mind & curiosity to the supernatural, PARANORMAL & my sense of wonder about the world.Ivan Reitman is one of my favourite movie Directors ever, he sits comfortably next to John Carpenter, I've always loved Reitman's films like his ""Kindergarten Cop"" & ""Stripes"" & ""Twins"" & ""Junior"" & ""Evolution"" & of course his masterpiece films ""Ghostbusters 1&2"" he's a legend of cinema. BUT!!!! Ghostbusters 1984 isn't perfect!!! The silly & embarrassing ""Ray & Ghost Blowjob"" scene doesn't belong in the film, it's embarrassing to watch that with ur kids & of course Winston is way underused, but i love this movie that came out the year i was born 1984. I literally grew up with Ghostbusters & Ghostbusters 2 & the animated series. I watched both Ghostbusters films over & over on video growing up & were staples of my childhood & movie-loving-heart. I couldn't not give both Ghostbusters films 10/10 ratings because they both mean so much to me. The '84 original is without a doubt a true Masterpiece of Cinema, but it's slime filled sequel stands as tall as the statue of liberty for being one of the greatest sequels ever made.From the beautiful opening music & into the iconic Library Ghost scene, Ghostbusters is a phenomenal Comedy Horror Classic, with a perfect blend of silly humour & Scary frights, the cast are Amazing & all four busters our like Super heroes to us film geeks!!!Bill Murray is a Comic genius, Dan Aykroyd is a Comedy legend & fantastic writer, Harold Ramis R. I. P was a fantastic Director & a the brains on screen & good old Ernie Hudson is an underrated Every man of Cinema.Love you Ghostbusters.Thank you Ivan reitman.Thank you Dan Aykroyd.Thank you Harold Ramis R.

"Prepare yourselves for the coming of Gozer, in this timeless masterpiece of cinematic macabre!","Ghostbusters is one of the most original and beloved films of all time, with it's unbeatable combination of sly humor and electrifying action, barring an inferior sequel and a questionable re-make, there's no other movie remotely similar and for over three decades it's stood the test of time, as a lasting tribute to the exceptional people who created it. If one had to place this one-of-kind movie into a category, it would have to labeled as an ""action-comedy"", because that's what this film undoubtedly brings to your screen - in massive quantity. Upon it's release in June of 1984 Ghostbusters was instant smash hit and still today is regarded as one of the best and most imaginative movies ever created, having both universal appeal and a timeless sense of charm.So whats it all about? Ghostbusters revolves around three struggling hack-scientists and their unique specialty service, surely a niche-market, of ""Supernatural Elimination"" which they offer to the people of New York City. Along the way expect to see the likes of a beautiful cellist and a nerdy accountant to become inseparably intertwined in the story, a story which plays out in a most unusual and colorful series of events, that indelibly sew the threads that which forms the fabric of this wickedly funny and off-beat tale of the supernatural. The cast of Ghostbusters (which boasts not one, but two SNL alumni) is sheer perfection and it would seem impossible for the movie to be cast any better then it was. But perhaps on even an higher level of perfection is the movies script, which is a masterpiece screen-writing (primarily the work of main-man Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis), that endows the movie with an incredible abundance of the most singularly distinctive dialog ever written for the movies; and because of this superlative level of writing talent Ghostbusters, to my way of thinking, is -by far- the most quotable movie ever.When speaking of the human talent that's behind this exceptionally witty masterpiece of the macabre, it's cast takes full advantage of a near-perfect script and deliver their performances with an infectious, often exhilarating, level of energy. The end result is a film that simply works well on all levels and it's cast of oddball characters instills the film, ever so potently, with a one-a-kind vibe that no other movie has matched. Ghostbusters is unquestionably a first-rate comedy, but it also so much more than that. But back to it's script and all the sparkling Aykroydian-genius that's behind it, but not even with a script of this caliber did all of it's ideas pan out. As proof of this, if you've seen the out-takes of this film, it appears that Bill Murray completely rewrote the first of the two scenes where they're in Danna Baretts apartment; in which the original dialog is terribly awkward and was wisely replaced with something much better (which I think results in one of the most charming scenes in the movie). ""They hate this (piano keys tinkling) that right boys it's Dr. Venkman!"" - as well as few other scenes that didn't make the final-cut at all.Not surprisingly for a movie that revolves around ghosts or more accurately the capturing or ""busting"" of ghosts, there's a lot of special effects work to speak of and the sheer quality and quantity of FX is just another part of the grand sum that is Ghostbusters. Had the movies effects not been so brilliant, well then it stands to reason that the movie simply would not have been as brilliant either. The type of effects one can expect to see in vast quantities are photographic effects, aninmatronic puppets, models and miniature work, and I think there may also be a little stop-motion magic worked into the mix. Not to forget all the great stunts and remarkably effective practical effects which are showcased throughout the film, these effects were created by means of compressed air, wires, mist machines and a lot of pyro-technics - my favorite among them literally involves a ton of shaving cream, which was dropped from a great height. As with with all other aspects of this movie, the effects have aged very well. Also there are some impressive sets to speak of such as the earthquake-simulating set and the spectacular astral gate set.Ghostbusters, not JUST a feast for the eyes, the late-great Elmer Bernstein would go onto compose his best and most experimental film score of his storied 50-year career, which is ultimately an inspired masterpiece of film composition. Bernstein's grand musical vision was brought to life by a standard full orchestra, AND was further accented -to brilliant effect- by the ""ondes martenot"", a rare electric instrument of French origin, whose tone does not sound entirely unlike that of a Theremin. This rarely used instruments (unless your Elmer Bernstein, he would go on to over-use it in future works) ethereal intonation was the perfect choice for creating the movies ""musical ghosts"" and it's unique coloring adds immensely to the overall feel of the film. Also when speaking of Ghostbusters one cannot fail to mention it's iconic and universally known theme song, a brilliantly catchy pop number with fantastic lyrical writing and singing, that which was written and performed by Ray Parker Jr. - but yet thee ole' Hughie Lewis (winner of the law-suit) may tell you differently.So if you are one of the many who saw Ghostbusters 30th anniversary re-release in the theaters, not but a few years ago, or have seen the newest Blu-ray version of the film. I think you'll agree that time has proved to be kind, irrelevant even, to this seminal classic of the supernatural. In fact you might say that Ghostbusters is ETERNAL, a testament to it's well-tested and long-standing appeal and popularity for which the reasons are as numerous, as they are well-founded. And for this reviewer, the only other movie I'd rather find myself watching is - Evil Dead II.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Ghostbusters,"Inspiration and style and culture is the engine in ""Ghostbusters""!

One of the most overrated and rubbish films in history,"I decided to watch this movie as it had been a few years since I had not seen it, and by few I mean 16 years and my God, what an awful film. I don't know whether it was the fact that I was a child or whether I bought into a collective delusion about what a masterpiece this movie was because after having rewatched it, I am utterly appalled and disgusted. This movie made me physically sick. It was not funny at all, not even a little bit and it's a movie stuck between different genres and yet it fails to define what it is. A comedy with no humour or a horror which fails to instill fear. It fails utterly at both and it's one of the most forgettable movie experiences I have had. Undoubtedly one of the worst movies of the decade. I have no idea how it got the ratings it did.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
One the best films of the '80s endlessly enjoyable!,"For this film everything simply worked, it is one of those ""lightning in the bottle"" incidents! The main cast is great and very likeable, their interactions and comedic timing is impeccable, they work off each other in a sublime way! The side characters are similarly memorable and help to shape this incredible film. It's comedy meets fantasy/horror setting is one of, if not the best of it's kind! The effects are great and hold up, mainly cause they are practical effects combined with early CGI, creating many memorable monsters and scenes. Add the legendary theme song and the ingenious idea of having Ghostbusters in the first place - guys who are kinda like firemen, but bust ghosts, using cool gadgets and what you get is a timeless classic!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Can the Ghost bring Gozer down?Directed by Ivan Reitman, Ghostbusters holds up well today, as it has an imaginative story, expert comic performances, fun effects, spooky moments, and a wonderful soundtrack.

I am not a snowflake and I grew on far worse stuff, but PG rating for this movie seems a little bit off. Still, it's very good and fun, so what more can you ask from the movie about catching ghosts?

did i actually wait 32 years for this?(the original Ghostbusters),"everybody I know has been telling me that this movie is a classic.so my roommate and I finally broke down and watched this alleged classic. neither of us liked it I thought it was unfunny and boring and my roommate echoed those sentiments.also,neither of us found the acting anything to write home about.however, there is some good news.i just saved a bundle on my car insurance.but wait,there's more.the disc is doubling as a coaster and door stopper.and in the next few days the disc will be very useful as we go skeet shooting.so it's not a total loss.i had much the same reaction after waiting years and hearing everybody I know tell me how great Raging Bull was.i hated it.in short,i could wait another 32 years before seeing both of these classics again and it wouldn't bother me in the slightest.i have yet to see the Ghostbusters reboot,but I plan to soon.anyway,this just my opinion.i give this movie an A for Abysmal.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

"They came, they saw, they kicked its ass!","Ousted professors and researchers of the after life Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) and Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) go into business for themselves as the Ghostbusters, paranormal investigators and elimantors. ""The franchise rights alone will make us rich beyond our wildest dreams,"" says Peter. Initially laughed at and mocked, they get their first customer in the form of the beautiful musician Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver), who's fridge is possessed by monster dogs. Then the G-men capture the green ghost Slimer (originally called ""Onion Head"" during production; Slimer later became their mascot of sorts on the cartoon) at a restaurant and before long they become a media sensation with ghosts coming out of the wood work left and right. This leads to them recruiting Winston Zedemore (Ernie Hudson). Then they discover that they're on the edge of the end of the world and Dana's building is the key to the whole thing, but first they must overcome William Atherton's misguided by theoretically well meaning EPA man before they can confront the monstrous Gozer and save the world.In a role originally intended for the late John Belushi, Bill Murray is a hoot as usual as the dead panned yet sardonic salesman professor Peter Venkman. Writers Aykroyd and Ramis have a little less to do but they're fun to watch as the overly enthusiastic Ray and Spock-like Egon. Sigourney Weaver, Annie Potts and Ernie Hudson do what they can with their roles of Dana, Janine and Winston respectively. You have to admit, it may be a step down from ""Alien"" but Weaver manages to imbue Dana with more grace, dignity and warmth than the usual love interest. Rick Moranis has a fun bit as Weaver's nerdy neighbor.Not only is the film funny, the film is also surprisingly creepy in places and boasts some great special effects along memorable music by Elmer Bernstein and the title theme song by Ray Parker Jr. Memorable moments include the library ghost, the eggs popping on the counter, the entire Slimer sequence, the appearance of th Stay-Puft-Marsh-Mellow Man, Harold Ramis attacking William Atherton, William Atherton being burrowed in marsh mellow, and pretty much any time Bill Murray is on screen (like when he yanks the tablecloth out from under the flowers), which is quite often. Don't miss the ""Dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria!"" line, or Winston telling the white mayor ""Since I joined these men, I have seen s**t that will turn you WHITE."" Film is dated only by certain 80s wardrobe and the excessive amount of smoking down by the characters.The sequel is funny and better than most sequels but still not quite on par with the first one. The first cartoon was good but impossible to find. ""Extreme Ghostbusters"" you can skip.As a trivia note, Bill Murray's character was voiced by the late Lorenzo Music in the cartoon series. Lorenzo Music was also the voice of Garfield the cat. Bill Murray has now replaced Lorenzo as the voice of Garfield for the new movie.Deleted scenes on the DVD include Janine giving Egon her lucky coin before he goes off to fight Gozer and the Stay Puft Marshmellow Man's hat falling on the populace after he gets blown to bits. Commentary by Harold Ramis and Ivan Reitman is also fun to listen to.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

My Childhood Favorite Still Holds Strong!,"I love Ghostbusters. The movie has always been a major part of life beginning with childhood. I'm very thankful I was introduced to this movie at such a young age. It is no surprise that the film was the biggest hit of 1984 and then some. The theater life was exceptionally long, but that is no big deal for a movie that helped in changing the landscape of feature films. This movie is considered to be one of Hollywood's first blockbusters. It also proved that special effects and comedy will work well together given the right ingredients (unlike Spielberg's disastrous 1941). These are just two of the main highlights that worked out in the film's favor.The film was directed by Ivan Reitman, the man behind comedic hits like Animal House and Stripes. He did have a say in the screenplay, which was first drafted by Dan Aykroyd. Aykroyd has always been fascinated with the paranormal. His family wrote books on ghosts or were mediums. His first script was more horror-based, but Reitman convinced him to lighten things up. He brought Harold Ramis (who worked with Reitman previously on the aforementioned films) on board to refine the jokes and add some much-needed humor. The script wasn't entirely used the way it was intended since Reitman wanted his actors to ad-lib. The studio, Columbia thought the film was toast, but boy were they ever proved wrong. Reitman knew the movie was hit at the first audience test screening when they laughed and felt fear during the opening library scene. That scene, with the older librarian being scared out of her wits, is one of the classic all-timers.The performances are great (especially the deadpan comedic performance from Bill Murray), but the technical side of things were amazing. The editing is a thing of beauty. The film had a very short production leash, so Reitman and his crew had to edit as they go. In a film which could have gone horribly wrong, there is an even mixture of comedy, drama, action, thrills, and chills. In an age where special effects dominate each film, I was still impressed with the special effects. The ghosts looked realistic enough. The Marshmallow Man was giant and scary. The zombie cab driver. And, oh Slimer! Our favorite ghost! He was apparently modeled after the late John Belushi. Finally, the movie would not have been the same without the music. Everyone knows Ray Parker Jr's famous title song. I love that song, too!Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), and Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) are scientists who work at Columbia University. They are fired after their grant ends. They begin a business to hunt down and capture ghosts. Business is bad at first and the public derides them. When Dana Barrett (Signourey Weaver) notices strange behavior by her Central Park apartment, she hires the Ghostbusters to rid her place from evil. Apparently, the place is a gateway to another world. Her oddball neighbor Louis Tully (Rick Moranis) also notices these monsters. Now business is great, and they even hire Winston Zeddmore (Ernie Hudson) to their team. The EPA associate, Walter Peck (William Atherton) convinces them they are doing the city harm and gets them thrown in jail. When New York City is placed under siege by ancient Sumerian god Gozer, the mayor may have no choice but to release them from jail.This film also gave belief to the studios that its okay for television folks to star in movies. The main trio were all SNL stars and this movie made bank. Murray had the most experience with movies and he also delivered the funniest performance. It is a deadpan one and his one-liners are brilliant. My favorite is: ""human sacrifice, cats and dogs living together, mass hysteria..."" If you understand the context, you'll understand the humor. Aykroyd and Ramis, while not given as much to do as Murray, do their best to create memorable characters. The chemistry between the three is definitely the highlight. Signourey Weaver is an odd casting choice giving her dramatic past in films like Alien, but she nailed the comedy when inhabited by the Gozer ghost. Rick Moranis totally got his character and I was down every second. I want to go to one of his parties!Ghostbusters was a major hit for Columbia and a film that was influential towards culture. It gave studios more confidence that comedy-driven special effect films could work after all. You would not have fun, awesome films like Men in Black if Ghostbusters failed. If you studied New York City history, you'll know that the early 1980's was a horrible time for the city given its propensity for violence and fiscal damage. Reitman said this film was his love letter for the city. It gave the industry a much-needed boost that they could film their productions here. Nearly forty years after its debut, the film holds up very well. It's funny, scary, has great special effects, and it proved why everyone loves Bill Murray.My Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

"A Film of ""Biblical Proportions.""","""Ghostbusters"" is one of the best and most iconic movies of the 1980s! It's brilliant core concept, quotable script and fantastic cast has cemented it as one of the most beloved comedies of our time!Even after 34 years, a decent sequel and a controversial yet painfully forgettable reboot, ""Ghostbusters"" is still just as well-regarded and popular as it was when it was unleashed upon the world in 1984! There are many reasons why it remains a landmark in pop culture, the iconography, the song that will never leave your head and the fact that the film employs a perfect blend of humour and spooky moments, there is so much to love!One of my favourite aspects of ""Ghostbusters"" is its original and creative premise. The story of blue-collar, ordinary people capturing extra-dimensional beings and Spector's is such an awesome and ingenious idea. Unlike the Men in Black, the Ghostbusters aren't specially trained agents, but average men who do their jobs not to save the world, but to get a paycheque (at least that's how they start out.) This unique plot makes ""Ghostbusters"" such a special and re-watchable film and gives the characters a relatability that makes them feel like real people.The ensemble cast in ""Ghostbusters"" is absolutely incredible! Every actor gives the film their all, the excellent dialogue manages to balance scientific mumbo-jumbo with realistic speech that, as previously mentioned, makes the Ghostbusters act like people that you could meet in the real world.I love every character in this amazing movie so it is almost impossible to decide who my favourite is! From the wise-cracking Peter Venkman (""Back off man, I'm a scientist."") to the loveable Ray Stanz (""Listen... you smell something?""), the deadpan Egon Spengler (""Sorry, Venkman, I'm terrified beyond the capacity for rational thought"") and the sadly and often forgotten Winston Zeddmore (""This job is definitely not worth $11,500 a year."")
The excellent performances and razor-sharp script gives the team a level of comradery and bravado that makes their interplay so enjoyable!The supporting cast are just as fantastic as the leading actors. The always stellar Sigourney Weaver and zany Rick Moranis provide more comedic situations for the filmmakers to play with and adds dimension to the movie's world.For a film that was released 34 years ago, it is surprising how well the visual effects, production design and creature designs in ""Ghostbusters"" have held up.
The ghosts and spirits in this movie are so awesome; the unique aesthetic makes the world that these characters inhabit feel distinct when compared to every other supernatural films. Although I love Slimer, my absolute favourite apparition in ""Ghostbusters"" (and my favourite part of the movie) is the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. He's visually striking, hilarious and downright amazing! I was shocked to learn recently that Mr Say Puft wasn't a real American mascot, but was created solely for this movie; I had always made the assumption that his inclusion in the story was simply an ingenious idea for product placement.There are a long line of epic cinematic cars from the 1980s. Owning a vehicle such as the Bluesmobile from ""The Blues Brothers"", the time travelling DeLorean from the ""Back to the Future"" Trilogy and the Batmobile from Tim Burton's gothic 1989 hit ""Batman"", is the dream of many a movie fan. The Ecto-1 is just as striking and memorable as all of the previously mentioned automobiles, you can tell, just by looking at it, that the car can perform dozens of spook-catching functions. As with the DeLorean, the Ecto-1 looks like it was built in a shed/ garage, not on a conveyor belt, which means that the personality of the vehicle makes it a character in its own right, not just a prop.On a quick note, the ""Ghostbusters"" logo is undoubtedly one of cinema's best. It's so simple yet so iconic, even before I'd seen the movie; I knew what ""Ghostbusters"" was.One of the most recognized elements of this film is its ear-worm of a theme song! Everybody on planet Earth knows the ""Ghostbusters"" tune; I don't believe that the movie itself would be nearly as popular if it weren't for Ray Parker Jr.'s contribution!I find it so amusing that at the time, ""Ghostbusters"" was considered to be a family film that all ages could enjoy. Whilst I don't dispute that kids can watch this film (as nearly all of us watched ""Ghostbusters"" as children) the fact that the movie contains an abundance of swearing, smoking, the greatest jump-scare ever filmed and occasional crude humour makes this a far more interesting watch than, say, ""High School Musical.""To summarise, I absolutely love ""Ghostbusters!"" It's hilarious, cleverly written and one of the most quotable and iconic motion pictures of all time. I shudder to imagine a world without ""Ghostbusters""...

The Perfect 80's Comedy,"I was six years old when this movie hit theaters, and as such it definitely has a place in my heart. That may or may not affect my objectivity in this review, but tonight I watched ""Ghostbusters"" for the first time since I was a kid, and I found it to be the perfect 80's comedy.Is the movie a bit cheesy along the way? Sure. But it's also iconic, and more importantly it's just plain fun. There's so much to pick up on with this movie when you watch it as an adult vs. as a kid. I laughed and laughed at the sight of the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man. Sure, that scene is funny at any age, but you really have to be an adult to appreciate the absurdity of the towering monster roaming through the streets of New York with a huge smile on his face.I also found the acting in this movie to be great. Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd steal the show, along with Ernie Hudson and Harold Ramis. And I kept on thinking to myself, ""Who is that woman?"", who plays the lead actress. I was stunned when the credits rolled to realize it was Sigourney Weaver. She's quite the looker in this movie--a big improvement from the Alien movies when she didn't have hair.All in all I have to give this movie 10 stars. That's a rarity for me, as I seldom give a perfect score to any film. But ""Ghostbusters"" is just too fun and too well made not to warrant this distinction. This well done, well made film is a pleasure to watch, no matter your age!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"An Excellent And Hilarious Classic That Brilliantly Mixes Comedy,SCI-FI And Supernatural Thrills.","Ghostbusters is one of the funniest films of all time that combines a great cast,script and special effects mixing Comedy and the Supernatural to amazing effect that makes this film an all-time classic.Ghostbusters tells the story of three college professors Peter Venkman(Bill Murray),Ray Stantz(Dan Aykroyd)and Egon Spengler(Harold Ramis)who work in the field of the paranormal and psychology. When the trio is fired from the college campus,Peter,Ray,and Egon decide to set up their own business as Ghostbusters. While the Ghostbusters have their success,they'll soon have to deal with ghosts in an apartment building on central park west and these ghosts won't be easy to capture.Ghostbusters is a classic film because it balances different genres,a great script and unique special effects. I love genre mash-up films and Ghostbusters is one of my favorite mash-up films because like some of the best mash-up films Ghostbusters successfully mixes together very different movie genres to amazing effect throwing in everything but the kitchen sink but never becoming uneven or unfocused achieving it's goal in entertaining viewers with a classic that is hilarious,unforgettable and will be re-watchable for all times and generations. Comedy and the Supernatural blend well together in this film because of the great and memorable interactions of the main characters and the funny situations the characters go through. When the film is funny it remains funny and never slows down and when the film becomes suspenseful and spooky it works as well. When most films that mix together different genres and fail this one succeeds and succeeds with greatness and originality that has is masterful. Bill Murray,Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis were among the biggest Comedy stars during the 80s and the three actors make the characters Peter,Ray and Egon memorable,likable and iconic. The pursuit of the Ghosts and their interactions with other characters as well as each other is great,you feel like the characters really believe in what they're doing,which is catching ghosts. Peter,Ray and Egon's banter, interactions,lines and various conversations with each other and other characters is hilarious and quotable,combining and mixing great laughs sarcasm,wit,smarts and sometimes deadpan Humor in the scenes. Most of the lines will be in you head after watching the film. Ghostbusters is also one few films to never spawn imitators,copycats or remakes. I guess the reason that never happened is because Ghostbusters is a unique film all it's own that can never be repeated or duplicated. One of the things I also love about Ghostbusters is that the film while it creates it's own world of Fantasy and Science Fiction it's still very much grounded in reality thanks to the characters and showing the city of New York and it's people as they love and embrace the Ghostbusters. The screenplay by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis is original,funny and genius writing great dialog that's memorable,well-written and smart and has scenes that are well-placed and timed and great. Mixing laughs and special effects isn't an easy task but Reitman,Aykroyd and Ramis balance it out where Comedy and special effects don't override each other. It's Saturday Night Live and National Lampoon meets Poltergeist. The only films that I can think that mix Comedy and special effects well is Ghostbusters 2 and the Back To The Future trilogy. The Action in the film is great and intense and during the Action scenes there is wonderful laughs and fantastic moments that will stick with fans and viewers. The special effects in the film are excellent and still hold up to this very day. It's obvious every cent on the special effects especially towards the end. I won't spoil it for you but the very big special effects shot at the end is one of the funniest and surprising endings in film history that will make your jaw drop and have you roar with laughter and is one of the main reasons Ghostbusters is a classic.The whole cast does a great job in their roles. Bill Murray is excellent and at his dead-pan best as Peter Venkman,the sarcastic,womanizing doctor who is smart and clever and Murray has some of the funniest lines in the film. Dan Aykroyd is brilliant as Ray Stantz,bringing a funny optimistic,child-like glee to the role. Sigourney Weaver does an amazing and sexy job as Dana Barrett,Venkman's love interest and has a great chemistry with Murray. Harold Ramis does a great job as Egon Spengler a scientist who's the straight man in the Ghostbusters. Rick Moranis is terrific and hilarious as Louis Tully,Dana's next door neighbor. Annie Potts is wonderful as Janine,the secretary of the Ghostbusters. William Atherton is great as Walter Peck,a representative of the Enivormental Protection Agency. Ernie Hudson does a fantastic job as Winston Zeddmore,the newest member of the Ghostbusters. David Margulies also does a fabulous job as Mayor Lenny,the Mayor of New York City.Ivan Reitman does a great job with the film,bringing a lot energy and imagination to the film. Reitman directs the Comedy well and also brings a sense of dread to the film when things get scary. Amazing direction,ReitmanElmer Bernstein's score is excellent at times very spooky,creepy and at other times lighthearted and optimistic. What a great score. And the soundtrack has great songs including the great iconic theme song Ghostbusters by Ray Parker Jr. Magic by Mick Smiley,Savin' The Day by Alessi,In The Name Of Love by The Thompson Twins,I Can Wait Forever by Air Supply,Hot Night by Laura Branigan Disco Inferno by The Trammps and Cleanin' up the town by The Bus Boys.

Fun horror/fantasy comedy with Murray & Aykroyd (etc.) but a tad overrated,"Released in 1984 and directed by Ivan Reitman, ""Ghostbusters"" chronicles events when three former parapsychology professors (Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd & Harold Ramis) set up shop in Manhattan as a curious specter removal service. Annie Potts plays their secretary while Ernie Hudson hires on as one of the team. Sigourney Weaver appears as the wannabe girlfriend of one of the ghostbusters (Murray) while Rick Moranis plays her geeky neighbor down the hall.There's always been some confusion about ghosts: Are they the disembodied souls (life forces) of dead people stuck on this plane? Are they 'flashes from the past'? Or are they demons (aka fallen angels or evil spirits) deceiving people into thinking they're 'ghosts'? ""Ghostbusters"" interestingly addresses all three, sort of, which I found interesting. It's an amusing horror comedy with a classic early 80's cast and soundtrack. The F/X are well-done for the time, although quaint today, which I suppose is part of the movie's charm.Yet I think the high ratings are largely due to nostalgia because I wasn't entertained nearly as much as I thought I'd be. ""Men in Black"" (1997) took this prototype and arguably made a better film. Still, ""Ghostbusters"" is a fun, iconic flick and certainly worth checking out if its attributes trip your trigger.The movie runs 105 minutes and was shot in New York City & Los Angeles with studio stuff done in Burbank, California. The script was written by Aykroyd & Ramis.GRADE: B-/C+ (5.5/10)",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Spectacularly entertaining and funny,"Immensely entertaining. Ghostbusters is one of the purest forms of entertainment to have blessed the silver screen. The premise is nothing short of ridiculous, but somehow the whole thing comes together to create a spectacularly fun time.I think I've seen this film at least twice before. However, I was quite a bit younger then, and I have wanted to revisit it many times. The thing that surprised me the most was how funny this film is. The scene where Peter visits Dana's apartment for the first time is incredible. I was laughing out loud almost the whole time. I suppose that a lot of the humour would fly over the heads of most kids, my younger self included. But it wasn't just that scene, almost the entire film is ridiculous. Certainly, the absurdity of it all creates comedy on its own, but the character interactions tend to be very funny as well.Although I didn't remember how funny Ghostbusters is, the thing that makes it such an excellent film, is its ability to entertain. I'm a huge proponent of the idea that films are above all else entertainment, and should be treated as such. This film is one of the best examples of how to do entertainment right. It's funny, it's action-packed, it has great characters, and it's overall just a great time. This is exactly the kind of movie that you put on when you just want to have some fun and eat some popcorn. You don't have to think much, if at all, and you'll have a great time. Sometimes that's all a movie needs to do, and this one does it almost perfectly.I didn't remember enjoying this film as much as I enjoyed it now. Maybe it has to do with me finally understanding the humour in it, or maybe I was just in the mood for exactly a film like Ghostbuster. Whatever the case may be, I thoroughly enjoyed watching this ridiculous and over-the-top journey. The more I watch 80s movies, the more I seem to enjoy them. There's something unexplainable about them that films nowadays lack. A sense of endless possibilities and a mood that can only be described, as carefree.I haven't had as much fun with a film in a long time, as I had with Ghostbusters. It served as an important reminder of the ability that movies can have. The ability to take you into another world and make you forget about life for a while. When a film gets it right, it's a wonderful experience. And Ghostbusters gets it very right.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Nearly as Much Fun to Watch as I'm Sure It Was to Make,"I threw this on so my wife and I would have something familiar to listen to while we assembled a new set of IKEA furniture, but instead we wound up squatting on the floor, transfixed for the duration. The special effects really haven't aged well and the plot's quite corny, but the jokes are so good and the actors so timeless in their roles that the inherent negatives only add to the movie's charm. It's one of those films I quote every single day without even thinking about where the lines are coming from. When I've committed almost every single bit of dialog to memory and still roar with laughter when the most familiar words hit the screen, that's the sign of a real keeper.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
A True Classic!,"Ivan Reitman's 'Ghostbusters' is A True Classic!

"Only in the 80's, you could take bad spirits in good spirit...","Just like ""Stayin' Alive"" or ""Mrs. Robinson"", Ray Parker Jr.' ""Ghost Busters"" is one of these instantly identifiable songs as the first four seconds are enough to make you recall the lyrics that go along. Indeed, who doesn't know whom to call if in their neighborhood there's something strange. Ever since 1984, the movie has been a cultural phenomenon and speaking for myself, I learned to draw the iconic logo before I even saw the film.But let's get back to 1984. There's something very revealing about that year's ten highest- grossing movies, in order: ""Ghostbusters"", ""Beverly Hills Cop"", ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"", ""Gremlins"", ""The Karate Kid"", ""Police Academy"", ""Footloose"", ""Romancing the Stone"", ""Star Trek III"" and ""Splash"". Think about it, six comedies, variously overlapping with romance, adventure and horror, but still comedies; only two sequels, and one of them so over-the-top it is funny in it own twisted and politically incorrect way, the rest consists on a musical and a sports underdog film, typical feel-good movies.Those were the good old days, when the box-office champs weren't made of franchises fillers or heavyset blockbusters, when there was still room for originality, even of uneven quality, when the special effects driven movies didn't take themselves seriously and were more fun to watch than these depressingly square and clinical universes today's directors embark us in. Now that the 80's enter their thirties, we realize how entertaining, imaginative and fun they were. You went to the movies to have a good time.And if there ever is one film that encapsulates that spirit, it's the story of three outcast parapsychologists with gray uniforms chasing ghosts with a vacuum-like device attached to packers. Of course, it sounds better as ""Ghost Busters"" and much cooler with the logo that became a defining sign of the 80's, one I'll take before any Batman or Superman shield. Seriously, let these guys fight together, I'd rather have a hot-dog stuffed green monster charging at Bill Murray, and sliming him in the process. Forget the truth, justice and the American way, some psychic nuisances and a trio of misunderstood weirdos will do.And ""Ghostbusters"" is a movie made by performers who knew what the 80's was about, what the public wanted and it doesn't come as a surprise that these guys come from TV. It was a project written by SNL alumni Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd with John Belushi in mind, but his untimely passing entailed many changes in the script. And with gentlemanly class, Ramis and Aykroyd let the lion share of one- liners to Bill Murray, giving him the role his comical legacy needed: a wisecracking scientist named Dr. Peter Venkman, such a constant jerk-ass you can't even tell if HE can tell whether he's serious or not.Ramis plays Egon Spengler, the egghead and Ayrkyod is Raymond Stantz, the good friend and most emotionally involved of the three. You have the trio made of the mind, the heart and the crazy spirit, and their chemistry is the key to the film's success. They're later joined by Ernie Hudson, who plays Winston Zeddmore, the everyman of the group, and to some extent, the needed 'voice of reason'. A lot has been said about the way Hudson was treated by the film's marketing, but I don't think the race card is to be brandished here. And there's something oddly original in the way a significant character pops up halfway through the narrative.The film also counts on nice supporting performances. There's Sigourney Weaver as Dana Barrett, a cellist who's the 'first to call', after witnessing some strange phenomena in her kitchen. There's also a familiar face of the 80's, Rick Moranis as Louis Tully, the meek and geeky accountant who's obviously infatuated with his beautiful neighbor. For some reason, she unable to see what he's got to offer, and the eight inches between them don't help. She also doesn't call Venkman's 'romantic' tirades but the ghost storyline finds a smart way to reassemble these two romantic subplots, when Dana is demonically possessed by a spirit.And Venkman's reactions to her exorcist-like condition proves at least one thing, it takes a lot to shake the guy. And that's the most brilliant aspect about the film, the special effects can satisfy any sucker for horror or Sci-fi movies but the fact that the three players handle it as pure routine is a great example of tongue-in-cheek humor and a subtle satire on New York's inner wackiness. After all, where else can you see a TV ad about ghost busting? I also love how the blasé secretary played by Annie Potts doesn't even question their works, and when she asks Winston whether he believe in these things, he tells her that for money, he'd believe anything (I thought there was a waste here for a funnier line but never mind).Everyone is so crazy that the closest to come to a sane person is the antagonist, an EPA lawyer who had all the reasons not to trust these guys who use radioactive material for their jobs. But only William Atherton, the soon-to-play Thornbug in ""Die Hard"" could have made himself more unlikable than jerk-ass Bill Murray, and he's the one who by turning off the power that stocked all the taken slime, liberated them and turned New York into the outlet of the most demonic presences, using Dana's building as a channel. We get then to a climactic showdown, whose special effects might distract from the comedy for a little while, but not too long.Indeed, the masterstroke comes from the form taken by the evil presence, and this is the stuff iconic movies are made of. ""Ghost Busters"" isn't without flaws, but they're of such microscopic and negligible nature compared to its iconic magnitude, that the film works as a ""Critics Buster"" too.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

I asked my mom what is Ghostbusters, she replied ""You will see for yourself soon."" She bought both Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters II later that day and I watched both in one night. This scared me the first time but I kept watching multiple times. The special effects are some of the best in a film. Also gotta love the soundtrack. I have it on CD in my car, the teaser poster, and proton pack and props, this movie made a huge impact on me and opened the door to explore other films. I highly recommend this.

Something that Harold Ramis (Egon) directed!But this.... This?? Did I watch the exact same movie that so many drooling 80s kid are raving about??? Not only is it nonsensical, stupid, inappropriate, with bad dated effects, and having many characters with hardly anything likable about them, in my view, ""Ghostbusters"" was way overrated, and is insanely rated ""PG"" though it has a TON of swearing, sexual thematic elements & suggestive contents, and scary & frightening images! I BEG the MPAA to re-rate this flick for that very reason!The upsides I can list are the one joke about ""Dickless"" did get a chuckle out of me. And the theme song seems a bit cool.

The character of Rick Moranis was almost totally ruined in being turned into a totally stupid character - his ""Honey, I Shrunk the Whatever"" series was so much better. And the giant marshmallow man??? What was with that turning into a mascot sold in stores?? If I remember the story correctly, it was an accident!I'm so glad I didn't grow up with this film (while being a 90s kid), 'cause quite frankly, the caring people who loved & brought me up didn't WANT me to grow up with this schlock of a film!

Funny ghost movie with a hilarious Murray,"I watched Ghostbusters for the first time since it's original release, and it has worn well. The story of supernatural exterminators is clever, the pace is quick, the special effects are fun, and much of the movie is very, very funny.The main reason the movie is funny is Bill Murray as a smarmy professor who inexplicably wins over the resistant Sigourney Weaver with his oily charm. Murray's performance reminds me of meaner version of 1940s Bob Hope; they both specialize in the ""that looks really dangerous; you go first"" style of humor to great effect.Aykroyd and Ramis are generally overshadowed by Murray. Outside of Murray the most entertaining performance is Rick Moranis as a creepy accountant.The special effects are for the most part quite good, with silly ghosts and a tremendous and ridiculous final monster. Some of the other effects are pretty bad, most notably those bear-like creatures. The blue-screen edges are actually visible in places. I watch them and think, how is it possible that critics of the reboot actually claimed the original had better special effects? Are they *blind*? Anyway, very entertaining movie that I found almost as enjoyable as much as the much-defamed reboot. Well worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"""Back off, man. I'm a scientist.""","When I was a kid myself and a few friends would play GHOSTBUSTERS in the snow. We would get sticks like they were proton packs and jump around in the snow like the ending of this film. Having a ball and showing what an incredible influence this film had on a group of 9 year olds.Dan Aykroyd originally got the idea of having ghost-battling guys traveling through time and space fighting off demons and ghosts for himself and his old SNL buddy John Belushi. Yet after Belushi's death and finding that the film would be way too expensive Harold Ramis was brought in to rewrite the script with Aykroyd. The story is about three parapsychologists (Aykroyd, Ramis and Bill Murray) who after getting the boot from Columbia University the three decide to get into the ghost-catching business. Their biggest case is that of Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver in an excellent role, playing straight to counter act Murray's zaniness) where a portal of evil may have been opened in her apartment building.Bill Murray is a riot in the role of Dr. Peter Venkman and really might be his funniest role and he has had some excellent ones over the years. Also starring Rick Moranis who is also a riot as Dana's loser neighbour Louis Tully who has the hots for poor Dana. Ernie Hudson is Winston Zeddemore the fourth ghostbuster brought in because they are so busy. Annie Potts is Janine Melnitz the secretary of the Ghostbusters, who also brings a nice bit of attitude to the role. Finally, William Atherton plays Walter Peck, the human villain if you will, who is an Environmental Protection Agency inspector and wants to shut them down.Beyond some great humour it is also filled with some effects that were mind-blowing in 1984 and some still hold up pretty well today. It was nominated for an Oscar for the effects. Just love the effects of the Gray Lady in the library, the green ghoul Slimer and the Stay-Puft Marshmellow Man and the four need to battle at the end of the film. The title song as well is super catchy by Ray Parker Jr. (also nominated for Oscar). The music by Elmer Bernstein is terrific and really adds creepiness and humour when needed through his music. I own the LP for the Ghostbusters soundtrack and its certainly a keeper.Directed by Ivan Reitman, who also added ideas to the script and while it almost made an incredible $300 million at the box office it also may be his greatest film I have ever seen of his. He also had directed Murray and Ramis on the great STRIPES and Murray on MEATBALLS, which Ramis was also one of the writers. I think he does a knock-out job here and handles the humour along with the other elements such as horror and fantasy extremely well. I mean this just isn't a straight-up comedy.Followed by a sequel in 1989, a remake in 2016 (which I have yet to see, but am apprehensive in doing so) and another sequel is coming in 2021, which I hope is at least half as good as the original. Also had a cartoon THE REAL GHOSTBUSTERS which I watched every day before school when I was a kid. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Well, If you want good graphics, I do not recommend you watching a movie that was made in 1984! And let's get to the parts that I think should be improved. I think the movie jumped from situation to situation extremely fast. You may be like it, but for me I like to watch the movie happenning slowly and only going on by one.

"Back off man, I'm a scientist.","Three scientists start a business catching ghosts and uncover an evil spirit looking to destroy the world.As a child of the 1980s I remember Ghostbusters being a phenomenon of spectacle and merchandising. On more recent viewings with my daughter I can appreciate that it is a timeless classic. A four year old should not be interested in a group of thirty-something men in overalls chasing slimy ghosts around Manhattan but she is.The production values stand the test of time with effects created by some of the best minds that Industrial Light and Magic lost. The highlight for me being the green ghost Slimer who was based on the late John Belushi's character 'Bluto' from National Lampoon's Animal House, a fitting tribute to the actor originally selected to be Pete Venkman.It is a movie with both character and characters that give it a wonderful charm. Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd and Harold Ramis have exceptional chemistry and couldn't be more perfect for their roles. Ackroyd and Ramis play the heart and brains of the outfit, which fits perfectly with us knowing they also wrote the screenplay. In Murray they have the perfect foil to their nerdish personas. He gives us Venkman, one of the great comedy characters of 20th century cinema. A deadpan, lecherous, charlatan who fronts the business with more streetwise brass than his colleagues. There is more than a hint of 80s free-market opportunism and Reganomics about their set-up that encapsulates the era well.Supporting characters are also strong with Sigourney Weaver, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts, Rick Moranis and William Atherton all giving memorable performances.The weakest area in my opinion is the plot itself. It doesn't really draw you in, it's just something for the characters to do while they make you laugh and used as an excuse for more spectacular effects to be shown. It's not bad by any means it's just not something I particularly cared much about.A thoroughly entertaining film with lovable characters and memorable moments for all the family to enjoy. For me it is an 8.5/10, but I like to round upwards.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Who You Gonna Call?,"I loved the movie as a child and even watched the cartoon that somehow turned Slimer into a good guy. Looking back, it ruins the continuity, but luckily as a little kid I didn't care. I even enjoyed the widely panned sequel, yeah it wasn't as good as the original, but it is still funnier than much of what Hollywood releases today. Not to mention the numerous memorabilia such as bed sheets, lunch box, and action figures.The movie also introduced me to the comic geniuses that are Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis. Keep in mind that Saturday Night Live, Caddyshack and previous movies they were in were before my time or were in movies that my parents wouldn't let me see at the time. Murray plays Dr. Peter Venkman, the reluctant leader of the group who would rather pick up some hot chick than further his science career. Aykroyd is Dr. Raymond Stantz, the naive one of the group who enjoys his work a little too much. And Ramis, the perennial straight man, plays Dr. Egon Spengler. All of them hit each joke perfectly.In addition to the main cast, the supporters are just as perfect. First is the scene stealer, Rick Moranis as an accountant turned Keymaster. Sigourney Weaver, who did look good back then but the frizzy hair hasn't aged well, is Venkman's love interest turned Gatekeeper. Then there are Annie Potts as the token New Yorker secretary and Ernie Hudson, the only ghostbuster without a Dr. in his name that keeps the group grounded and keeps thing in perspective from a regular guy's point of view.The movie itself maybe not be as quote worthy as other 80's classics and some of the CG has not stood the test of time (where George Lucas when you need him) but the movie as a whole is still worth watching especially with Halloween coming up. So fire up the DVD and let the Ray Parker Jr. blare (which I don't think sounds anything like Huey Lewis' I Want a New Drug).

I always have enjoyed the sequel much better than as a child, it was my first movie but now as an adult, I love and enjoy the original movie to death! It is the only movie I own on Blu-ray disc and I still love it.This is an amazing movie! Funny, smart, well written and directed. It features an outstanding performance from Bill Murray, great showings by Harold Ramis, Rick Moranis and one of the last documented instances of Dan Aykroyd being funny on film (he was blown by a ghost!). In fact, the film gets a great performances from nearly everyone who appears in it- from Annie Potts, to the guy who played Lenny the Mayor, to the handsome cab driver who calls Rick Moranis an asshole. In addition, they had one of the best ""a-hole"" guys ever to appear on film, as the film's bad guy- I'm talking of course of the grossly under-rated William Atherton- who played the EPA guy, ""Dickless"". Atherton, of course went on to play memorable a-holes in Real Genius and of course he was the annoying reporter in Die Hard (1988) but here in Ghostbusters, you really see a solid performance by maybe the best guy to play an a-hole in films in the 80's.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Remains just as amusing and hilarious after 32 years,"After 32 years, ""Ghostbusters"" remains just as amusing and hilarious as when it first hit cinemas, full of gut-busting dialogue and many memorable scenes.Like most great comedies, ""Ghostbusters"" relies on the interactions and conversations between its characters, but leaves enough headroom for some great visuals that play along with the gags.The rest of the film reveals something greatly lacking in many modern comedies: smart dialogue, full of quips, cynicism, sarcasm, and all-around zaniness that feels spontaneous rather than scripted. We don't gather a sense of jumping from one pratfall to the next or from one comedic situation to another. There's a terrific flow in the narrative where each quirky one-liner and special effects-driven prank naturally leads to other, sometimes bigger, laughs.I can't think of another comedy that smoothly transitions from a laser-tag show against a demigod to a battle with a Godzilla-like marshmallow giant without missing a beat.Demonstrating that big-budget special effects can mesh well with laugh-out-loud comedy, the film also enjoys being one of the most successful comedy franchises ever made and continues to convert a new generation of fans with each viewing.Read More - http://reelchat.com.au/blu-ray-disc-review-ghostbusters- 1984/Reel Chat ""Ghostbusters"" episode - http://reelchat.com.au/reel-chat- 1-0-ghostbusters-1984/",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Who You Gonna Call,"One thing I like about re-watching movies from my childhood is the fond memories it brings back. ""Ghostbusters"" did that and it was definitely one of my favorites.All of the characters are great but my favorite remains Louis Tulley (Rick Moranis). Rick Moranis has since disappeared from the silver screen (not until after making the ""Honey I Shrank the Kids"" movies) but he left an indelible mark upon this movie. He was so obliviously nerdy it was hilarious. Added to that was his puppy dog attraction to the more suave and sophisticated Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) which made his character even more likable. He so wanted to impress her with his odd habits but could never seem to win her over.And of course who could forget the theme song by Ray Parker Jr.? I think the line ""Who you gonna call?"" was mentioned in pop culture repeatedly at the time.""Ghostbusters"" is just a fun, family-friendly movie that can be enjoyed over and over.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

It's definitely a well balanced movie and it always keeps you on your toes.

Twizard Rating: 93,"We all know the theme song. Society has long been ingraining it into our heads since forever. And no matter where you stand on the Ray Parker Jr./Huey Lewis debate, we can all say that, when it comes to Ghostbusters, the good looks don't outweigh what's on the inside. The film, even today, is as fun a movie as ever. It's a microcosm of the era--perhaps not as much as Back to the Future was a year later, but in 1984, the decade was just about forming into itself.The film follows a group of perverse scientists who have long been trying to uncover the world of the supernatural. After ominous events start happening and their radical ideas get them fired from the University which they work at, they form their own business as ghostbusters.Even though it works, Dan Aykroyd is slightly underutilized here. He and Harold Ramis serve very little purpose as either straight man or top banana. But Bill Murray and Rick Moranis prove to play the funny guys well enough.Murray was the king back then. He could say or do whatever he wanted without outshining any of his costars or commandeering a film. What he does so well is give the audience both broad and subtle humor, letting them chose for themselves. And he's at his best here. Moranis is phenomenal as well--although he doesn't get nearly enough screen time. He and Murray stay comedically brilliant without ever having to step on each other's toes.It doesn't hold up quite as well as some of its contemporaries, but it gets better with every watch.It can be slow intermittently, but that's just a sign of the times. Slightly dated, sure, but Ghostbusters still gets the job done.Twizard Rating: 93",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

The thirtieth anniversary re-release,"Much to my dismay and disappointment, I am usually never able to catch films that are re-released into theaters on account of an anniversary or a 3D upgrade. This is mainly because so many films often come out the same weekend as the re-releases to, leaving me strapped to make the decision to rewatch an old favorite in theaters or seek out and review the new releases, the ones people want to read reviews of. As somebody who watches anywhere from forty to sixty films a month, I need to choose wisely, and never, until now, have I chosen a re-released film over a new release.This all changed when an unsurprisingly slow film weekend in August revealed the thirtieth anniversary release of the 1984 classic fantasy-comedy ""Ghostbusters"" in about seven-hundred theaters in the United States. In a time where some of the strangest, most unremarkable releases come out of the woodwork in American cinema, ""Ghostbusters"" seemed like a perfect break from the drudgery of blockbusters, under-impressive sequels, under-performing risks, and so forth. Even as I sat back to watch one of the funniest and most original comedies of the 1980's on the big screen, I felt like I was taking a mini-vacation from this gig I call my side-job/passion.I doubt ""Ghostbusters"" needs more than a brief plot summation, but the film concerns Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) and Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis), three misfits interested in the idea of supernatural forces and paranormal activity. The three men find themselves caught up in a whirlwind of popularity after being called to The New York Public Library to take down a ghost that has been haunting the library for sometime now, and following their success at identifying and capturing the being, the three decide to open up their own business as professional Ghostbusters, working with the city of New York to stop paranormal forces dead in their tracks. They are soon approached by Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson), to function as their fourth member, and attach themselves to Dana Barrett's (Sigourney Weaver) specific case, which concerns her apartment complex being overtaken by the demonic spirit known as Zuul, who's spirits are worshiped by Gozer the Gozerian, the God of Destruction.At first thought, the film sounds overstuffed and complicated, but as anyone familiar with the film knows, it's anything but. This is mainly because it would appear writers Aykroyd and Ramis bear the similar attitude about the entire project as the character Peter Venkman, sarcastic, lax, and carefree. This sounds like a criticism, but the fact that ""Ghostbusters"" bears such a collective and relaxed aura about its story and its characters never makes the film fall prey to any confusing subplots or technological jargon. It can be sarcastic, it can be smug, and it can be just plain silly, but all of the above reasons, and the fact that the idea is executed to the fullest extent, are the reasons this film is so loved and cherished, albeit worthy of a thirtieth anniversary re-release.Being that there's little to critique, as most comments have already been made and mine will sound very much like a reiteration of old reviews, one must comment on the joy of seeing a re-released film on the big screen. For starters, ""Ghostbusters"" has a great deal of elements that make it worthy of a big screen viewing. From the montage of catching ghosts, to the actual, developed scenes where catching Slimer is the gang's main objective, to witnessing the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man come to life on screen all compliment the inherent largeness of a theater screen wonderfully. Combine all of those elements with the terrific sound editing and elaborate special effects, which still look pretty good thirty years later, and there is an arguable reason to make a trip to the theater to see ""Ghostbusters."" Then there's Ray Parker, Jr.'s infectious theme song, which brings a smile to a nostalgic face, especially when heard through the expensive, surround-sound speakers of a theater. It's this song that is the bow to the entire experience of seeing ""Ghostbusters"" alive on screen again. If the joy of seeing Murray, Aykroyd, Ramis, and Hudson interact and exchange the same classic, witty banter we can all quote flawlessly isn't enough for you, Ray Parker, Jr.'s theme song will surely place the icing on the timeless cake.Being that this is a different review than usual, I'll end the review not necessarily recommending the movie (you should know by now if you are or are not a fan of ""Ghostbusters"") but recommending the experience to anyone who has yet to witness the phenomenon on a theater screen. The entire experience could make a wonderful introduction to classic, eighties films for the new generation, and for once feels like a genuine appreciation of the classic film without unnecessary upgrades in the third-dimension.Starring: Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver, and Rick Moranis.

THE FILM THAT MARKED MY CHILDHOOD AND AWAKENED MY PASSION FOR CINEMA,"The first Ghostbusters I saw were the animated series from Filmation studios, which made me have a great time on Saturday mornings when I was only about 3 years old, it was so well designed and its characters were very charismatic, one day my father I got home and brought a videotape that contained three episodes of ""The Real Ghostbusters"", when he played it for me, a beautiful Magic Window intro started and I kept watching those three episodes, they were totally different from the ones in Filmation but still I loved them, they had a certain charm, I wanted to keep it but it couldn't be because it was rented and it had to be returned to the video store, until at the age of 5 they asked me if I wanted to see Ghostbusters again and I said yes, that's when they put me on videotape of this same classic, recorded directly from the Spanish national Chanel, with commercials, when I saw it for the first time it had a huge effect on me, it transported me to a New York infested with paranormal activity, I was totally absorbed by that macabre and funny universe through At the same time, and for that good handful of funny and unforgettable scenes, it is a perfect movie in everything: extraordinary performances, especially that of Bill Murray, a successful direction by Ivan Reitman, a sublime script, the popular and catchy song by Ray Parker, Jr. ., the beautiful and excellent soundtrack by the great Elmer Bernstein and some impressive special effects, left an indelible mark on my life, there was no turning back, I was attracted to that wonder that awakened my first love and my first passion: cinema , and that I ended up getting hooked on the fantastic and bizarre genre, I liked it so much that I always asked my parents or my brother to play it for me over and over and over again, I never tired of seeing it on VHS or even today on DVD, changed my way of seeing the world forever, it is true that ""Who framed Roger Rabbit?"" It made me DISCOVER cinema, but the one that really made me LOVE cinema was this gem and it stayed with me forever.It has a splendid story of the very few that are made today, in which three failed university professors: the brazen Peter Venkman, the nerdy Eagon Spengler and the enthusiastic Raymond Stanz, investigate supernatural entities in the big apple, after having having their first experience with the ghost of a librarian they are fired from campus for their antics, so they decide to start their own business of ghost eliminators and investigators, at first no one calls them for help because people are unaware of the existence of spirits, until When a beautiful young woman Dana Barrett comes to ask for help after contemplating that her fridge has been possessed by an evil ghost, Venkman falls in love with the girl and decides to help her with her problem, after celebrating that the three of them have had their first client, her office secretary. Inexhaustible patience Janine Melnitz receives a call from a luxurious hotel and presses the emergency alarm, the three of them go on a ghost hunt mounted in an extravagant car, dressed as if they were exterminators of insects and armed with protonic equipment, they capture Slimer, a funny and gluttonous entity that can cross walls or people leaving trails of greenish and sticky slime, they put him in a special trap, after his first hunt the press and the media find out about his exploits, they begin to have clients and work all over the city catching ghosts, they are even joined by a fourth member of the team, Winston Zedmore, and in the two weeks he has been with them, he has seen events that have left him white, according to him, but not everything is glory because not only the bureaucracy will make life impossible for our intrepid and crazy anti-heroes, but Gozer an evil God will cause the destruction of the world and the Ghostbusters have to prevent it by any means. But what a good cinema from the golden 80s, where everything was magic and a lot of imagination, I hope the big Hollywood studios stop making so many remakes, so many unnecessary sequels and so much adolescent crap and go back to doing wonders like this, this movie is important part of my childhood and my way of being.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Who're ya gonna call?,"Ghostbusters is easily on of the best films from the 80s. It is a sci-fi action comedy that can match Back to Future for popularity. It was a film that was Bill Murphy's first commercial success and it had a successful sequel and spin-off cartoon series.Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) and Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) are scientists working at a New York University who study paranormal activity. They loose their position, being seen as a menace to the university who focus on popularity rubbish and not real science. The three decide to continue their research themselves, and to help fund it they form their own business, a ghost extermination services, the Ghostbusters. After they first successful capture they become instant celebrities and their business booms. One resident of New York, Dian Barrett (Sigourney Weaver), suffers a particularly bad ghost infestation, with an ancient demi-god tormenting her. She hires the Ghostbusters, who discover that all the ghostly activities were linked and including in the city.So what makes Ghostbusters work? Lots of things, a script with a good story, jokes and gags, with Ivan Reitman skill with action and special effects. The effects were spectacular for its time. It was easily Ivan Reitman's best film. What really works for this film is the cast. Bill Murray offers an excellent deadpan performance, having great timing with his jokes, showing why he is one of best comedic actor from America. Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis are also excellent comedic performers, having a different approach to Murphy. I enjoyed Annie Potts as the gruff, tough native New Yorker. Sigourney Weaver also rarely stars in a bad film. She beings in an originality person's perspective to the film. It would have been easy for this film to fall into slapstick territory; but luckily the writers and director avoid this trap, using more clever vebral gags and sharp wit, making the film a funny experience.This is a rare example that big budget comedy can work. It's a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Comedy legend,"One of the best comedy films in existence, and for several good reasons. Ghostbusters is one of those rare films that manages to stand head and shoulders above its peers for its originality, sharp wit, masterful storytelling and a cast of humorous oddballs.But what really sets this movie apart is the fact that it doesn't rely on pop culture references or inappropriate jokes, aimed to make the toddlers in the audience giggle. Rather it relies on sarcasm, visual creativity and the same brand of randomness that made the Monty Python group so successful. In essence, it's a timeless film, which humour stems from the human brilliance and not the lowest common denominator. It's a comedy film that even the most high brow film snobs can enjoy, as it doesn't treat its audience like idiots. There are several jokes that you can miss entirely and only get later when you have time to mull over the dialogue, which in my opinion is an extremely good thing.Furthermore, it's a very quotable film. The dialogue is at times razor sharp and some of the verbal gymnastics between the main characters still make me blink my eyes in surprise. The cast is also very talented, and no less could have been accepted for this script, but luckily they managed to get the big boys and girls to play these characters. The chemistry between Bill Murray and Sigourney Weaver is especially memorable.If I were to nitpick, I'd say that the special effects haven't aged all that well. Some of them are still surprisingly good, like the ghost trapping beams, which should not be crossed, but some, like the guardian ""dogs"" of Zuul look really fake. It doesn't ruin the film, in some cases it even adds to the film's charm, but it's still an eyesore in certain scenes. And the ending has a certain amount of ""love it or hate it"" quality to it. I lean more towards hate it, but only slightly.All in all this a classic. A comedy film that managed to create its own universe, its own cosmos and mythology. It did that with ambitious story, clever writing and a great cast of characters. It worked back then and it still does. Find it, see it, love it. Force other people to watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Should be the benchmark to any contemporary big budget film-maker,"It's symptomatic of many a big budget, box office blockbuster that the film itself, it's plot (if there is one)and character end up playing second fiddle to the awesome and costly special effects. It seems that many top Hollywood film-makers seem content to show of their flashy special visuals rather than competently entertain it's audience and tell a solid, coherent story. It's as if they're practically throwing their over-sized bank balance at us and saying ""Look how much money I've got!"". Perhaps then that it's feasible that contemporary big shot movie producers should be forced to be sat down sometime and watch ""Ghostbusters"". A movie that to my mind and many others rates as one of the most iconic pictures of the 1980's. Rivalling such other blockbuster's of the era as ""Back to the Future"" and ""Gremlins"" for it's sheer iconography. Although for my money it pits each movie to the post for it's original, adroit, self knowing screenplay which was the brainchild of comic actor/writers Dan Ackroyd and Harold Ramis. Two men who respectively cut their teeth working on comedy sketch shows ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""SCTV""A sublime celebration of the Horror Comedies of the 1940's and 50's which included ""Hold that Ghost"" and ""The Ghost Breakers"". The film's basic but innovative premise revolved around three parapsychologists who are drummed out of the University which finances their studies due to their outlandish theories. Now officially unemployed and their reputations being seemingly left in tatters they never the less endeavour to go in to business for their own. As due to recent scientific findings after a fortuitous if not hair-raising encounter with a ghostly apparition leads to the conclusion that it's possible to trap and contain a ghost indefinitely. This leading them to take the cue to go in to business for themselves as supernatural ""pest controllers"" and calling themselves ""Ghostbusters"".The concept was one so offbeat that it might have very well fallen flat on it's face in the hands of lesser accomplished, comedic minds. But in the capable hands of both Ackroyd and Ramis it proved arguably to be the most lucrative and proud achievement of their individual careers. It's success led it to spawn a (admittedly inferior) sequel, an animated kids TV series and a slew of merchandise with a more recent video game having proving to be a financial hit on the gaming market.It's also proved to be a fittingly effective vehicle for the sardonic, comic talents of one Bill Murray who was cast in the now legendary and popular role of Peter Venkman. One that was earmarked for the late John Belushi who would have seemed the obvious choice given that he was riding on the coattails of his success with friend and co-star Ackroyd in the cult musical comedy ""The Blues Brothers"". Tragically however it was not to be and in a bitter-sweet twist of fate it proved to be master-stroke that Murray would be cast. For it's nigh impossible to picture anyone else as the infinitely sarcastic, fast talking Venkman. Inhabiting the role as if he were born to it Murray's Venkman is the spokesman for the audience on screen. Vocally and cynically commenting not only only on his two colleagues outlandish theories but on the extraordinary events that occur throughout the film. And with a hilariously memorable array of ingenious set pieces that include an early encounter with a Library Ghost, their first job tackling ""Slimer"" in a a prestigious Hotel, Rick Moranis's Louis Tully being pursued by a rampaging demonic Terror Dog through New York City. It all culminates in a legendary show stopping finale where the ""Busters"" face against an ancient Sumerian Demi-God called Gozer on top of a New York City apartment building. And if that weren't enough Ackrord and Ramis succeed in pulling out one more eye-popping surprise out of their imaginative bag of tricks! And while the then formidable(for it's time) special effects, which incidentally though dated still hold up reasonably well. They are that rarity in that they don't overshadow the movie's sharp and masterful screenplay. If anything it reinforces and enables the audience to buy in to the insane, nonsensical spectacle on display. Affectionately and deftly aiming slight digs at the far fetched ludicrousness that abounds the film. A scene in a elevator part way through the picture winningly highlights this . When discussing with his colleagues how they haven't had a sufficient successful test of their Ghostbusting equipment, Bill Murrays infinitely cynical Venkman dryly remarks ""Why worry? Each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on his back"".The inclusion of the often obligatory love interest is present as is it routinely is with many other blockbusters and takes the form of Sigourney Weaver who portrays Dana Barrett, the protagonists first client. A character I'm pleased to say doesn't feel as if she's been shoehorned in and plays an integral key role in the overall plot. And Weaver being the capable actress that she is, is effortlessly charming with a down to earth, candid manner that proves her to be an excellent foil to Murray's brash Venkman.Ernie Hudson, the unsung hero of the movie and although relatively minor in screen-time and presence and given little to do still makes some impact, especially in a beautifully penned and acted moment with Ackroyd regarding the Bible and It's references to ""Judgement Day"". Throw in a amusing turn from Rick Moranis as Dana's neighbouring irritant Louis Tully as well as Acyroyd's child like enthusiasm as Ray Stanz and Ramis's portrayal of the aloof, verbally monotone, awkward brains of the team, Egon Spengler and you have one of the most smart, classy and clever comedy blockbusters of the past twenty-five years!

Who ya gonna call?,"""Ghostbusters"" is what I think one of the best movies of the 1980s, and and still stands out as one of the best movies overall even today.

In this film, it is fun to see the Ghostbusters trying to rid the city of pesky ghosts, goblins and poltergeists, and then facing the ultimate ghoul of all in a portal to another world, where untold evil is threaten to be released.The special effects for the ghosts were nicely done - believable and creepy at the same time. Dan Aykroyd , Harold Ramis and Rick Moranis did a great job on the story - exciting, adventurous and humorous. And, Ivan Reitman did a great job directing, providing us with a movie with a solid plot and story and character development.Composer Elmer Bernstein provided a catchy music score, and the famous ""Ghostbusters"" song is sung by Ray Parker Jr. in this movie, making it one of the most recognizable piece of music in the world. In addition, the ghosts Slimer and the Marshmellow Man are also introduced in this movie and became some of the most iconic and recognizable movie characters.A great movie overall that has come to symbolize the 1980s, but has stood well through the test of time - one I would watch over and over again.Grade A",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

This film manages to pack some of the most memorable things ever put to screen into a mind boggling 1 hour 30 minutes and my only complaint is that it isn't longer. The only real issues here are possibly the special effects which do look slightly aged but for me it just adds to the heart of this film, giving it a look that has never quite been replicated.

The ending is, again, cheezy, but the giant marshmallow man is pure genius. Gotta love that car, too (Ghostmobile?).

Disappointing and Flat Upon a Rewatch,"Something about this movie doesn't really gel for me anymore. It definitely used to be a movie I loved. I remember having a lunchbox with the logo on it. I remember even loving the second one. My latest rewatch of this was one of the strangest and flattest experiences I've had with a previously beloved movie.I'll start with the biggest gripes: firstly, it's sloppy. Winston is an almost comical afterthought, and the whole absurd (and hastily dropped) story line with Peck is shoehorned into the movie because they'd written themselves into a corner with no way of linking the story line with Sigourney Weaver into the main narrative. The earthquake in front of the apartments just before the climax is pointless and only seems to be in the movie so it could reach the allotted running time. Secondly, and it pains me to say this, for the most part I don't find it funny. There are jokes that I enjoy, and Rick Moranis is so, so perfect, but it's just really not what I'm looking for anymore. Finally, I was bored, and that was the most surprising thing to me. In many cases the more I'm familiar with a movie or song the greater my love grows. In this case, it just left me waiting for the parts I thought I liked, which never seemed to come.This sounds like a pretty negative review. I think that's just the disappointment talking. I didn't hate anything about this. There are scenes and performances that I really like. The ghosts and demons are fun. The theme song is my jam. It was just an empty experience when I thought it would be anything but. Though I certainly would prevent anyone from watching this if they were so inclined.

What is the big deal?,"This is one of those films that when it's over, after you read the positive reviews you're like, did we watch the same movie??? I'm sorry but I really fail to see why people rave about Ghostbusters. It's formulaic and corny. I didn't come into existence until the early 90s, so I can't say I was present to observe the evolution of films, but with the Internet, books, and other databases, I can safely say I have enough resources to draw a conclusion. Based on my research, movies began declining in the mid 70s. The Golden Age of Cinema ended in the mid 60s. Films were relatively decent for the next ten years. By 1975 or 1976, filmmakers began pandering to the lowest common denominator. American society was becoming increasingly less sophisticated, and would therefore laugh at or be entertained by just about anything. So by the 80s, films were crossing the line into becoming utter garbage. Knowing the year Ghostbusters was made, I should've expected to not be impressed.Parapsychologists (Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis) start a ghost-catching business to combat the paranormal activity in New York City. I was uninterested for pretty much the whole time. I never saw where Bill Murray was funny. He reminds me of the can't-put-your-finger-on-it-but-you-know-they're-weird-as-sugar-honey-iced-tea type of person. The only reason he's popular is because there's a lot of people on the planet who are social rejects themselves, so they understand his style of humor. Aside from voicing Garfield in the 2004 movie, he doesn't make me laugh. How he is off screen really isn't different from on screen, if not worse. His behavior is absolute cringe at those celebrity golf tournaments. In Ghostbusters he doesn't deliver a humorous or inventive performance. Women were made out to be a few fries short of a happy meal (Sigourney Weaver's character sees a demonic world when she opens her fridge, but when Bill Murray's character opens it, of course nothing is there, and he uses being in her apartment as an opportunity to seduce her). The combination of the occult with religion was just bizarre, and unnecessary. Working out of the basement of Dan Aykroyd's home in Martha's Vineyard, he, Harold Ramis, and director Ivan Reitman spent two weeks tirelessly and meticulously constructing the script, both writing separately, then rewriting each other's drafts. After watching the finished product, I would have never guessed the script received so much examination. The dialogue is nothing special, and the jokes are lame. I could see kids today being bored with this movie. I watch a ton of vintage stuff, so I don't need technologically advanced special effects to be entertained, and I was even bored. No way am I going to bother with the sequels and remakes. This is one of many overrated franchises.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

"28 years later, and the flowers are STILL standing!","The brainchild of co-screenwriter and co-star Dan Aykroyd, ""Ghost Busters"" was a pivotal movie in the life of this reviewer, helping to turn him into the movie nut that he became. It's one of the most enduring and endearing contributions to the popular culture of the 1980's, complete with tons of witty lines and its catchy hit title song.The story, for those out there who are newcomers to this classic, deals with three paranormal researchers who find it a blessing in disguise when a university kicks them out. Now they're able to go into business for themselves - the business of trapping and storing all spooks in NYC. We have Bill Murray as ""the mouth"", Peter Venkman, Aykroyd as ""the heart"", Ray Stantz, co-screenwriter Harold Ramis as ""the brain"", Egon Spengler, and Ernie Hudson as Winston Zeddmore (gotta love these names), whom they need to hire when the three original guys realize they need an extra man.There are lots of iconic bits and images to continue enjoying - the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, the ""terror dogs"", the Ecto-1 vehicle, the opening commotion in the New York Public Library, the final battle with all powerful Gozer, the Ghost Busters' initial gig taking care of pesky green guy Slimer, etc. It was a testament to just how big this movie would break when even in the early going black market T shirts were being sold with sayings from the movie printed on them. The bouncy pop soundtrack is a joy, as is a score by Elmer Bernstein that alternates between horror and humour just as the movie itself does.And ""Ghost Busters"" indeed stands tall as a big budget Hollywood example of how a movie can be both scary and funny in equal measure. The cast couldn't be better; Sigourney Weaver is radiant as love interest Dana Barrett, Rick Moranis often hysterical as nerdy neighbour Louis Tully, who riffs like crazy in a priceless speech during a party. William Atherton is just right as snooty nemesis (and foil to Venkman) Walter Peck of the E.P.A. Annie Potts is just a hoot as deadpan receptionist Janine. Lots of other familiar faces in supporting roles and bits, too: David Margulies, Steven Tash, Jennifer Runyon, Michael Ensign, Alice Drummond, Jordan Charney, Timothy Carhart, John Rothman, Reginald VelJohnson, and Jean Kasem, with Roger Grimsby, Larry King, Joe Franklin, and Casey Kasem seen or heard as themselves.

"Ghosts take over New York, and only Bill Murray and Co. can stop them.","It's a bit difficult to review this film in a conventional way. Normally, I'd be disappointed with a movie that has as many tonal inconsistencies as this does, and also has such a convoluted plot. These are valid concerns, and are enough to make a lot of movies just plain suck. But in the summer of 1984, convention was thrown out the window and an unsurpassed American classic was born. Ghostbusters is enormously entertaining and one of the funniest movies ever, containing some of film's most iconic moments of all time. With vintage special effects, great characters, and large doses of Bill Murray, Ghostbusters is a movie that everyone can, and probably will, deeply enjoy.The film opens in a mood typical of a horror movie, with an innocent, elderly librarian being terrorized by some sort of ghost. Then suddenly, some great 80s music kicks in and in the next scene, we are introduced to the least scary or serious thing ever: Bill Murray. This man makes Ghostbusters his own, and completely steals the show. His dry, sarcastic humor is so perfect and unique, and he can conjure up laughs with just a look. Nothing fazes him, everything amuses him, and nothing is allowed to be taken too seriously in his presence. Without him, this movie would be vastly different, and probably quite a bit less fun. Interestingly, he has great chemistry with Sigourney Weaver, and it's a joy to watch their characters interact. Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis complement each other (and contrast with Murray) magnificently, playing socially awkward geeks with hilarious results. Ernie Hudson, portraying the last-minute fourth ghost buster, also gets in a few great lines. William Atherton from Die Hard also appears late in the game, playing just as great an antagonist as in said film. Adding more to the spectacle is the inclusion of Rick Moranis, playing one of his best characters ever. Add it all together and you get a brilliant comedy that is completely outrageous, yet at times quietly subtle in its humor. It's also one of the few of its kind that actually gets better with age and repeated viewings.However, there's still the matter of the utterly inane story to consider. By the climax, any remaining semblance of plot is basically thrown out the window. But the film's rather ridiculous premise actually serves to better the film. Some of the movie's most strikingly memorable moments come from the silliest concepts, such as ""crossing the streams,"" the Slimer ghost, or the colossal Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man (all of which still look fantastic, even by today's CGI standards). And it's examples like these that tell us how much fun the filmmakers were having with the whole concept from the get-go. All the ridiculous backstory with Zuul, Gozer the Gozerian, the Gatekeeper, and the Keymaster doesn't mean much; it's all about being entertaining, and Ghostbusters does this perfectly.With such a strange foundation for a film- that is, being big- budget, special effects-laden horror-comedy- there were countless things that could have gone wrong. Against all odds, Ghostbusters gets everything absolutely right. It's blast for people of all ages, and an absolute laughter riot. It has an immensely talented cast backing the superb Bill Murray, just doing what he does best, and a plethora of noteworthy scenes and one-liners. It's a must-own, and it deserves 10 out of 10 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Ghostbusters (1984) - It's Slimer! It's the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man! Who You Gonna Call? GHOSTBUSTERS!,"""Ghostbusters"" is one of the most classic movies of the 1980s, and it's also one of the best comedies of all time. But it's mostly one of my favorite movies of all time. After losing their jobs at the Columbia University, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis, star as scientists who team up to become a group of natural ghost hunters named the Ghostbusters. They later research demonic spirits haunting a woman's apartment. Sigourney Weaver portrays the victim of a haunted spirit in her apartment named Dana, who has a geeky neighbor named Louis Tully, portrayed hilariously by Rick Moranis, delivering the best performance in the movie, who awkwardly tries to hit on Dana. With some unique and cheesy visual effects that are actually awesome, a cast of characters that deliver light-hearted laughs, a script with some classic humor, and an impressive directing job by Ivan Reitman, ""Ghostbusters"" really works as a classic ghost comedy. The movie contains a list of some of the best actors in the typical 80s comedy including Murray, Aykroyd, Ramis, Weaver, Moranis, Annie Potts, William Atherton, and Ernie Hudson. I actually laughed a lot with this movie, and I think it deserves to be laughed with. Every moment is memorable and classic like my two favorite scenes: the Slimer situation at the hotel, and the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man situation at the end.

Nostalgia is a helluva drug,"Ghostbusters was one of my favourite movies as a kid in the early nineties. It had jokes, scares, great special effects, four nerdy cool guys shooting lasers, a scantily clad babe...what else can a young boy wish for?Fast forward to twenty-five years later, with me viewing the movie for a second time. An uncomfortable truth wriggles it's way in my head as I watch: that some nostalgia doesn't stand the test of time. I notice my stubbornness to critique the movie but contemporary reality quickly illuminates how dated the movie is. Sure, it's still a big budget spectacle and some of the effects are still cool, but effects being dated can be forgiven. What ruined the overall experience is mainly how sexist and adult the movie is. I wonder how Bill Murray, obtrusively sleazebagging his way thoughout the movie, nowadays would reflect on his role here. What I used to look up to as child disturbs me now. The movie sets the sexist tone early, particularly with a bad joke that correlates menstruation with mental derangement. I watched with dumbfounded amazement. It might be pure speculation but I also got the impression that lots of cocaine where being used while making this movie. There's an exubarant vacancy to it all. A celebration of American culture that is loud, and too often cynical and hollow.While watching I started to view the movie as a cultural time capsule that through it's charicatures exposes some of the more appalling aspects of American culture in the early eighties. Women are mainly being played as puppets and black people are at best 4th option sidekicks and are most often seen as background figures doing low level jobs. Maybe as a kid this black sidekick showed me that black people can actually contribute to saving the world. Or hang with the cool white guys. So, in defense of nostalgia, maybe there is a spin to thiis. Do I devaluate the movie too much using my contemporary lens? My younger mind was better suited to appreciate it as pure entertainment. My older self is better suited to view it as a ideological object of study. If I balance these two out I would rate it a 5, with my younger self giving it a 9, and my older self giving it a 2.

Give me Zedde-More.,"With a new ""Ghostbusters"" film rapidly approaching, it seems like an ideal time to revisit the other three films and see how they hold up. ""Ghostbusters"" is, for me, one of those unassailable classics that I've been watching, on VHS, DVD and Blu Ray for the best part of 30 years - though I have to admit that it's been a while. It mostly holds up, though I'd love to know how I'd feel about it, if I watched it for the first time now.Three scientists, Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) and Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) establish a legitimate ghost removal and storage service after their research budget is removed. Though their business proves both lucrative and controversial, one of their earliest cases, that of Dana Barratt (Sigourney Weaver) and her penthouse apartment, becomes key to the survival of New York, and perhaps even the Human race.I can accept, during this showing that some of the movie (particularly the first half) can be a bit patchy. I think that the strength, and this small weakness, of the film is that improvisational nature of it. It works for the dialogue and the character moments, but perhaps not the story. This all improves after the midway point when the Zuul/Gozer storyline really steps up and takes the film home. There are certainly a couple of moments in the film that appear different, watching them again as an adult. I don't know what I used to think was happening in the sex dream segment, but now I just question why it was included at all. I also would question what Venkman had planned for his date with Dana Barratt, if he's brought a tranquiliser with him.I disagree with the other reviewers though who say that the visual affects don't hold up. I say that, generally they do - certainly these models and puppets look better than the CGI effects from certain movies from the 90's. Its scary moments remain powerful and I have a vivid memory of not watching the librarian transformation on the VHS version. It is, primarily, a comedy though and I did still laugh at bits of the film even with this number of repeat viewings.Though I don't think it would feature on a list of my absolute favourite films anymore, ""Ghostbusters"" is an undisputed classic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Timeless classic!,"Oh boy! What can I say about Ghostbusters that hasn't already been written? This is one of the most successful films of all time and also spawned a very successful sequel, cartoon series, and catapulted Bill Murray into super stardom. Let's not forget the catchy theme song as well. We all know what the plot is about, with the Ghostbusters (Igon, Ray, Peter and Winston) trying to prevent the end of the world. The movie is filled with excellent performances by the cast and, for its time, outstanding visual effects. As a matter of fact, this is one of the most impressive casts ever, featuring Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts, Sigourney Weaver, Rick Moranis and William Atherton (and a cool cameo from Reginald VelJohnson from TV's Family Matters playing a cop, of course).I recently bought the box set of Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters 2 on DVD and there is some very interesting information within. Originally, the Ghostbusters movie was going to star John Belushi as Peter and he and Ray were going to be ""intergalactic ghost busters"" traveling through space and catching ghosts. Although this is an interesting premise, I don't think it would have delivered quite the way the final version did. Maybe that would work if they made a third film in the series?I'm giving Ghostbusters an 8/10.

To this day, it still holds up with current movies being released.The story revolves around Dr. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Dr. Ray Stanz (Dan Akroyd) and Dr. Spengler (Harold Ramis), who start up a ""ghost busting"" business when they are dismissed from their positions from the University in New York. Little do they know, that their business is going to explode, as an ancient god Gozer, prepares to enter the world to bring upon the end of the world.With great special effects, great comedy bits (mostly provided by Bill Murray), and a fantastic cast and story, ""Ghostbusters"" is a film for comedy and action buffs. Although the special effects do look kind of dated today (especially in the scene where the demon dog is chasing Louis through Central Park), they are still incredible and bring the characters to life. This was before computer technology became a huge part of cinema.If you have never seen this film, go out and take a look, I guarantee that you will love it. For those others that have already seen it years ago, take another look, it is still a classic that stands up today.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

"""Somebody blows their nose and you want to keep it?""","""Ghostbusters"" is one of my personal favorite. It is insanely funny and quotable. The cast are some of the best comedy actors doing some of their best performances. Of course the stand out is Bill Murray with his greatly deadpan performance. Delivering such lines like ""He slimed me!"" And ""Cats and dogs..."" with perfect deadpan perfection. All in all greatest comedy of the 80s(yeah I said it!).",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
the greatest movie ever made,"Ghostbusters is hands down the greatest movie ever made. Everything about it is absolutely spectacular. There is just so much to say about it. For one, the entire cast is set in the roles they were born to play. Honestly. Bill Murray is at his comedic best. Sigourney Weaver is brilliant as a bright, independent woman and is given the added fun of being possessed for a good portion of the movie. Rick Moranis was destined to play the Uber-nerd Louis, Dan Aykroyd perfectly cast himself as a lovable, semi-naive back-up comedic effect guy to Bill Murray, and so on and so forth (I only get 1000 words). Aside from this is the fact that there is truly something magical about the whole premise. A group of guys, not super men, but just some guys, get together and decide to combat the supernatural problems of the world (well, New York). There has always been a certain aspect of this that made me feel better; the realm of moviedom, after having countless horror movie fiends and people running from said fiends, now had heroes to fight back. Everyone knows you can't do anything to fight a ghost. Until the Ghostbusters came along. What is especially fun is that with this certainly ridiculous sounding plot, the movie is executed in a completely mundane manner. If someone heard the story idea, they may think of some awful action movie or an Airplane-type absurd comedy. Instead, the whole film is done in a ho-hum type manner, with normal (enough) believable people having to save the world from certain doom. Yikes. Then, of course, we get into the fact that it really is just about the funniest comedy ever. You really can't completely appreciate everything if you watch it with someone who laughs too loud, like a drama kid or a line-reapter guy (hopefully you know the people I reference). You would just miss too much. It isn't a movie that necessarily will have a person rolling on the floor laughing at everything, but there are countless moments where, if you have the kind of sense of humor the world needs more of (and I don't mean that in some political sense or anything so don't read into me that deep), you would chuckle and think to yourself ""that's funny."" But again, you don't have too much time to think that, because something else funny is about to happen. Subtly. I once read someone's review on this very website that said that Ghostbusters was one of those movies that you think is good the first time you see it because you're in a theater and it all seems really big and whatnot, but isn't really that great when you go back and watch it again. This person must walk backwards or something, because that's completely opposite from the truth. And yes, I say ""the truth"" rather than ""my opinion"" because I looked it up and it is the truth.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

The climax with Stay Puft fits the bizarre and comical atmosphere.There really are no flaws for me personally.

A perfect storm,"Ghostbusters is a perfect storm. The writing is gold and the cast is legendary. Meanwhile, the film transcends genres with magical elements backed up by excellent production design. From the proton packs to the Marshmallow Man, so many supernatural components of Ghostbusters are iconic despite not being the focus of the movie. In reality, Ghostbusters is a straightforward comedy about average joes starting a business. The extravagant sets, visuals, and plot points merely accentuate that comedy. Because prime craft went into both the core humor and the surrounding atmosphere, Ghostbusters can't be replicated. Even if studios poured blockbuster budgets into simple comedies, it's unlikely to gel like Ghostbusters.Interesting fantasy is rare, witty comedy is rarer. Successfully fusing those two is nearly impossible (just look at the sequels). It works here because every role is played perfectly. The focus is rightfully on the sharp humor, complete with defined characters, playful edits, and supreme acting. The tone is serious enough to maintain integrity. The sound design heightens jokes and scares. The special effects are elaborate without overindulgence. And the classic theme song solidifies the mood. Ultimately, Ghostbusters nails every mark, making it universally loved and one of the greatest comedies ever.Writing: 9/10

Weaver's use of sensuality in her character renders her terrorizing and horrifying, especially since the conveyance of seductiveness usually has the opposite effect.

Recommended,"'GHOSTBUSTERS' - 1984Directed by Ivan Reitman{Stripes; Meatballs}Starring Bill Murray{Caddyshack; Stripes}, Dan Akroyd{The Blues Brothers; Trading Places} and Harold Ramis{Animal House; National Lampoon's Vacation}Plot Overview: After encountering a librarian ghost, three scientists setup a new protection agency: The Ghostbusters, specialising in the busting of ghosts. No one takes their craft seriously, but when a demonic force begins to threaten the city; it's up to the Ghostbusters to stop it before it is too late.I know, I know. It's criminal that I only just got around to seeing this wonderful movie. If you haven't already seen this movie, I urge you to see it now, and not wait as long as I did to do so. Everything about this movie is good, pure, family fun and entertainment. Some idiots would say that that is a negative, but I very much so disagree. This movie is accessible to ALL people, no matter their age or background. It's excellently crafted fun that the whole family can enjoy and laugh to.What are this movie's major pluses? The FANTASTIC chemistry between the cast certainly comes to mind. Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd and Harold Ramis are phenomenal in their distinctive and memorable role as Peter, Ray and Egon respectively. I've watched this movie once and I can easily remember everything about their characters. They are all fun, memorable and unique. As for Whinston, that's another story that I'll touch on later.Accompanying the holy trio is a side helping of Sigourney Weaver{Alien; The Year of Living Dangerously} and Rick Moranis{Acting Debut}. Both of these actors do extremely well in their unfortunately minor roles. I particularly loved Moranis as the socially awkward, inept next door neighbour to Signourney Weaver. He NAILED this role and was responsible for a great deal of the film's laughs, after Murray of course.The humour in this movie is awesome. I dare say it's a universally loved classic of comedy. Murray delivers some of the best one liners and jokes of the 1980s, and the remainder of the cast do their very best to support him. I'd say only two characters didn't have a funny line and that'd be Dana Barret(Sigourney Weaver) and Egon. However, Weaver isn't in the movie that much, and Egon's straight faced attitude ironically makes for a barrel of laughs. Even characters I didn't like(more on that later) had couple of good lines and jokes.As far as more minor praise, the soundtrack for this movie is flawless. The now iconic Ghostbusters theme tune could genuinely go down as one of the greatest theme tunes of all time; it is that excellent.What issues do I have with the movie? I take issue with a couple of the characters. Firstly, Whinston. What is the point of this character? He shows up. Makes a decent joke or two. And nothing else. I know this film has a sequel so maybe he'll get more screen time then, but as it is - there are only three Ghostbusters worth talking about, in my honest opinion. Next, the secretary was also pretty dull and useless. Like Whinston, she showed up, made a decent joke or two, and nothing else. There was literally NO point to her being in the film. Like, none. I don't understand why she was here because she contributed negative things to the plot. And finally, the villain. Ghostbusters' villain is not scary; it's not funny; it's not even a decent blend of the two. The villain in Ghostbusters is just plain bad. There is no interest in the character and no likable, charming or frightening qualities to even make them somewhat compelling. Such a weak villain for an otherwise awesome movie.I'll also say that the action in this movie is very weak. It consists of pointing a stick at a monster. BRILLIANT! No. No it's not. Without the comedy, action sequences in this movie would be remarkably dull and boring and just plain awful. I really wish that A LOT more effort was put into it because that(and a somewhat compelling villain) would have made this movie a 10/10, because it certainly has the ability to go for it.Overall, I loved Ghostbusters. It was fun, fast, inventive and had a heck of a lot of heart. Sure the antagonist is mediocre and the action leaves you feel unsatisfied, but the main trio of Murray, Akroyd and Ramis help make this movie the comedic classic that it deserves to be. I definitely recommend 'Ghostbusters', and I'll rate this movie 8 'MASS HYSTERIAs' out of 10!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

It came out at the perfect time had all the perfect ingredients and of course the perfect actors for each role. I don't think you'll ever find anyone that doesn't like Bill Murray as Peter Venkman. With his sarcastic and deadpan deliveries is no wonder he's the fan favorite. Dan Aykroyd as Ray Stantz is the professional of these paranormal entitys and he really makes you want to be a ghost expert like him. Harold Ramis as Egon Spengler is the awkward but intelligent member that manages to shy away from some nerdy stereotype. And finally Ernie Hudson as Winston Zeddemore despite his minor screen time makes such a huge impression with his charismatic charm. And it's just hilarious he only joined for a paycheck. Not only are the main characters great but practically every supporting & side character are just as memorable. Dana Barrett, Louis Tully, Janine Melnitz, Walter Peck, characters that all have their own special traits & are instantly recognizable. The whole concept of ghost exterminators was just creatively brilliant & it's just hilarious how the guys treat this like it's an ordinary everyday job. They're not action stars and they're never prepared for the situations that haunt them but manage to somehow put their brainpower together to overcome it. So many fun moments that never get boring, from hunting Slimer down in the hotel to Louis getting chased by a demon dog, & of course the enormous terror that is the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.

Who you gonna call?,"There's no doubt that 'Ghostbusters (1984)' is one of the greats, an absolute classic in every sense of the word. It's a genre-defining pop-culture icon that works just as well today as it did when it first released. Indeed, it's the sort of movie that nobody remembers having not seen; it's soaked directly into our collective consciousness. It's a comforting experience, the kind of thing you can almost literally just wrap yourself up in. It's warm, friendly and funny. I mean properly funny, too, as the piece often provokes genuine laughter. It's also always incredibly charming, its grassroots aesthetic making it infinitely approachable and its likeable stars keeping you invested in its often silly goings-on. The picture isn't really about ghosts - though the do play a large role, of course. Instead, it's about four entrepreneurial friends who start a business and work their way to the top of it. It's almost like a hang-out movie but with a more defined plot and some, eventually, world-ending stakes. It's hard to explain exactly why, but everything just works. It's entertaining, engaging and witty. It's a wonderful experience throughout. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

High 8/10,"Ghostbusters Mid 8/10A movie that feels outdated is surprisingly enjoyable. It's really by the books, and the movie isn't the most fleshed-out movie. We jump towards the plot and stay there for the ride. The story is straightforward to follow. But its simplicity provides a more laid-back approach for the audience. The film is a real ""show don't tell"" with their characters. The characters are very distinct, even none of them have any growth or storyline. You see them as individuals through their mannerisms and the things they say. The characters find a balance of comical to somehow realistic. From Egon being the most comical but serious, Ray is the most realistic but nervous guy, and Dr. Peter is the balance between being smug and a bit of a loveable a**hole.The mixture of the story and characters is enjoyable to watch. Thanks to its simplicity, the dialogue keeps itself from cringing by leaning towards realism. By making it feel genuine, the performances aren't Oscar-worthy but are simple enough to make people enjoy the movie. This is thanks to the excellent improvisations of Bill Murray and many of the cast. Rick Moranis' character is a great punching bag for the film. And the best character to punch is Walter Peck. They are not perfect, especially since the rapey nature of Dr. Peter is very wrong at times, but he isn't like this throughout the movie.The VFX used in this movie is phenomenal and iconic. The effects of their ghosts, from Slimmer to the Marshmallow Man and their proton guns, make the piece memorable. There is a reason why a lot heavily remember this movie of people. It's very distinct with its props and its monsters. The negative of this movie is that some scenes feel dull like they don't care or don't make it exciting. But the cast performances make up for it. The movie doesn't explore many things, like their personal relationships, especially Janine's crush on Egon. This is because this film aims to entertain audiences. And usually, films for the sake of being made are fun, but this movie had a goal of being entertaining in their way, so that was able to lead the film to be a success. Oh, and the film wastes Winston.Overall, Ghostbusters is a good movie that gives a great time for everyone. This movie is quite challenging to analyze due to the film being basic. There isn't much to deconstruct. What you see is what you get. And you get a GGM (Good Ghost Movie.)",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

The Difference an Audience Can Make...,"I saw this film on its first weekend in the UK, in Dec 1984.  Of course, it had already been a huge hit in the US, and the waves of enthusiasm had been lapping at our shore for months;  then there was that splendid theme tune which had been sat in the Top Twenty throughout late summer and the autumn, so by the time the pic finally arrived there was a tremendous amount of expectation.That Saturday night there were hundreds of filmgoers in the centre of Cardiff, but all to see the one film (I can still remember the deafening silence that greeted the cinema manager's enquiry, shouted down the length of that great queue, ""Is there ANYONE for 'Bachelor Party'?"").  Lord knows how many were turned away, but those that made it in cheered as one when the lights dimmed.  Moments later, we were cheering again, whooping our appreciation of the library ghost's horrifying transformation, and then we were singing - well, shouting really -  along to the theme song, and this mood of festive celebration (it was Christmas, after all) was maintained throughout the next two hours, and it was one in which I joined as enthusiastically as anybody, despite a bladder which had been demanding urgent attention since even before the trailers had finished (and despite the slight disappointment of that giant doughman, which meant nothing to us in the UK), and long before the film's conclusion, I realised that I hadn't had so much fun on a cinema visit before, and nor have I had since.And when it had ended, and we had filed back out into the winter night (some of us via the gents), with each of our group almost taking turns to ask the rest if they had enjoyed the movie as much as he had, we began the ritual of recalling favorite moments from the film. But something odd happened. ""Remember that bit when...when..."" When what? Hmm. Try again.  ""How about when he said...when he said...""  Said what?  Did what? Hmmmm.Long before we'd reached home, we'd realised that the only highlights the film had were moments of spectacle, that there hadn't been any really good jokes, or plot twists, or weird little moments of invention; less than 30 minutes after leaving the cinema on that high, we'd realised that the movie had been thoroughly mediocre.A paradox, surely: how could we have enjoyed it so if it was a poor film? Simple: the audience made it fun; we'd acted like our own warm-up act.  We were there to enjoy ourselves and enjoy ourselves we did, all the film did was provide us with a few cues so we could keep the vibe up.  I said it is the most fun I've ever had at the cinema, and so it is: it's the same sort of fun I've had on a fairground ride when there's a load of people all screaming in mock terror - wouldn't be as good if you were alone, and so it is with 'Ghostbusters'; I've seen it since on TV, and it passes the time if you've absolutely nothing else to do, otherwise...Oh, and I saw the sequel in a cinema, but one that was nine-tenths empty.

They soon get more than they bargained for when a demi-god tries to move in and destroy the world.Murray. Akroyd. Ramis. Two are SNL alumni and all are regarded as some of the great comic geniuses of our time. Murray has been leaning more towards drama these days (and Wes Anderson's piles of crap), Akroyd's career has come to a bit of a stand still and generally relegated to cameos, and Ramis has taken to directing films. All three are gifted comedians, and this is a representation of their best work. Murray is terrific as the sarcastic and egotistic jerk, Akroyd is hilarious as the energetic nerd, and Ramis is just as good as the anti-social nerd. Also in the cast are Sigourney Weaver as Dana Barrett, the skeptical musician who becomes their first client, and the target of Venkman's charms, Rick Moranis, Dana's nerdy neighbor who is so nerdy that he puts Stantz and Spengler to shame, and Ernie Hudson is great as the new recruit. And of course William Atherton is on hand to be the nosy asshole (which he does with great ability).Ivan Reitman was the go-to guy of comedies throughout the 80's and mid-90s. His style is professional, but solid, and he knows how to make a movie funny. ""Ghostbusters"" is easily his best film. It's funny, but also spooky. There are a few chilling moments in the film, particularly towards the end.There isn't anyone alive who won't have a great time watching ""Ghostbusters.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
I ain't 'fraid a no ghost,"A true classic, ghostbusters is a weird scifi comedy with the perfect cast that just works. The storyline is unique and the characters are well cast and decently acted.

Ghostbusters! Need I say more.,"Ghostbusters is one of the most known movie of the eighties and has become, like the Evil Dead ,a go to flick for beating back ghosts and devils in general. So with the new movie been coming, I believe it is time to review the movie that mixed science, paranormal and comedy. The story is well known ,but for those who have no idea about it (I pity you) , a team of scientist is trying to find ways in order to track down and capture ghosts in order to get fame and money for their research and for Bill Murrey get lade.Now let's analyze why did it get so much fame. Is it good as a flick?Yes it is definitely entertaining as hell, with great one liners, jokes that we still use and of course it epic theme song who everyone know, from the movie ,the television series (from there I learn it) or videos from YouTube. Also it manages to bring two genres that usually don't mix well science fiction and fantasy with great results! And Bill *beeping* Murray, he deeds no introduction, he is awesome in every movie he is in ,except from Garfield.Does the effects hold up nowadays?Not very well, I mean they are nice to look at and they don't feel fake. However comparing them with what has come... there is no comparison they haven't aged very well and today even a ten-year-old can say the difference between the effects and the costumes on scene. But there aren't so bad there are joke ,are still descent.Final question: Do we need a sequel?The trailer for the up coming flick is banded and some say it will suck loyally ,but I believe we have to see the final product in order to say if it is good or not. However when Ghostbusters 2 came out many said that it was unnecessary and it was a shame for the Logo ,but after more than two decades it has get a great cult following with many saying now that the backlash was an overkill and why we don't have a ghost busters 3.In general, cross fingers and hope that it will good and that fun overreacted ,it won't be the first time!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
The ending,This was probably my first time seeing the first movie because when I saw afterlife I barely understood what was going on it all makes sense now I gotta say the first and the last movie were both great they both had funny scenes in it but both of them were great except that afterlife was like a knock off of the first Ghostbusters you would have to watch the first one to get Ghostbusters afterlife and give it a better understanding of the plot so I give this movie a big thumbs up and can't wait to see the next Ghostbusters because I'm pretty sure all 3 movies are good. And I also hope they make a sequel to Ghostbusters afterlife but I'm not too sure about that.,9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Funny and Original!,"Whwn I last saw this instant classic, I was hardly more than a child in kindergarten. I enjoyed the film back then, and I still enjoy the film eleven years later.This film is about three wacko scientists who have nothing to do. So they decided to chase and capture the supernatural for profit. Their business does OK, but a dilemma arises. They have to save NYC from evil ghosts.The acting is the film is just plain great. Bill Murray is one of the funniest guys from the 80's. He adds sarcastic humor to this film. The rest of the crew, I liked.Everything works with this film. The plot and dialogue are fantastic with each other. The special effects are great even to today's standards. I must say how wonderful the music is. I liked the score and of course, the song by Ray Parker Jr.Overall, this is a great film, a tad underrated. This is a great classic. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"A perfect cocktail of comedy, horror and action, the 80s classic!!","Ghostbusters is a supernatural comedy film directed and produced by Ivan Reitman. The film stars Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Late Harold Ramis, Sigourney Weaver, Rick Moranis, Annie Potts, William Atherton and Ernie Hudson.Peter Venkman, Raymond Stantz and Egon Spengler loses their jobs as scientists, they starts an establishment called Ghostbusters to fight the evil ghosts lurking in New York City.I really liked the film, the film was also funny, entertaining and brilliant. The CGI of the film might look little outdated but the era in which the film was made the CGI looks impressive. The plot of the film is fresh an the execution is superb.Acting is superb and the trio were just amazing in their respective roles, Sigourney Weaver, Rick Moranis were equally impressive with later being the most funniest.

Without the benefit of nostalgia it's lame,"Watching Ghostbusters for the first time is 2022 was difficult. The tone of the film is so odd I couldn't quite get comfortable over 100 minutes.From the first apparition onwards I didn't know weather I should be laughing, scared or taking it seriously.There are some interesting parts, such as the TV advert for the Ghostbusters but they seemingly went from professors to amateur ghost fighters overnight, having zero experience and then suddenly heaps of sophisticated equipment.It felt a bit like they were making it up as they went along, the relationship walks a similarly weird line between amusing and creepy and I can't say I was ever truly rooting for them.Watching without the benefit of nostalgia it's all a bit lame and outside of the fairly amusing Marshmellow man and iconic music I was a little disappointed.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Most hilarious movie I have ever seen,"Yes, it's true. This movie is one of the most very funny movies I have ever seen. The plot,script,and the actors (BILL MURRAY, DAN AYKROYD,HAROLD RAMIS) are excellent. My most hilarious scene in this movie is where the four (NOW WITH ERNIE HUDSON)meet with the mayor after the incident where Walter Peck(WILLIAM ATHERTON) orders the power grid shut off, and when that happens, it sends all this pink stuff in the air, and the 4 share their comments with the mayor. When Stantz (AYKROYD)says, ""Everything was fine until the power grid was shut off by d---less here!"" Then here's the punchline of this part. When Venkman(MURRAY) has his say, after the mayor asked if they caused the explosion, he says, ""Yes it's true.This man has no dick."" At this time, I was rolling over the floor laughing. I think you should see this movie yourself, because believe me, this movie will injure yourself laughing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Great soundtrack,"Others have sung the praises of this movie's comedy, acting, pacing and writing, all of which were fantastic.  The other thing that strikes me, even today, is how good the soundtrack for this movie was.The soundtrack album for Ghostbusters was one of the few soundtracks I have ever purchased.  This was also a time when the soundtrack was actually music played during the movie, not simply some rock songs played during the credits.  The music was important for setting the mood and setting up transitions.From the theme song, to the great drum riff as two of the Ghostbusters discuss the meaning of all that is going on, enjoy the music as you enjoy the show!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Great film!,"Where some films tend to only work a few times, Ghostbusters is consistent. Although, I've found movies such as CLUE, Dr. Strangelove or Airplane to be funnier at different times in my life, this one still makes me laugh even after seeing it hundreds of times. From the opening scares to the ending credits, it will almost surely reel you in. I've laughed harder at some moments in other films but it's rare that I find one that's funnier throughout. Even those films lose their edge after you see them a few times...this one just doesn't. If you haven't seen it, do so. You will almost certainly be glad you did. If you have seen it and didn't like it, try watching it again in a few years. It's almost sure to grow on you eventually. I dare anyone to sit through this movie and not laugh once, no matter how many times they've seen it. If you don't laugh, you're either trying really hard to hold back, have a very odd sense of humor or are dead! It's just that funny. Although I don't rate films, I would easily rate this one a five out of five, placed among the classics. Believe it or not, I think that it belongs alongside Citizen Kane and Lawrence of Arabia. It also spawned an entertaining sequel in 1989. Enjoy!",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

One of the best syntheses of comedy and effects ever,"Ghostbusters remains one of the best syntheses of comedy and great showy special effects ever. (Its closest rival is perhaps Men in Black.) The only negative: I guess it has to accept blame for all the mediocre (and terrible) bloated big-bucks pseudo-comedies that have tried to do the same thing over the years.Not sure it was worth it--but Ghostbusters itself was and remains fresh, funny, just a tiny bit sexy (the ""Keymaster,"" indeed!), and just spectacular to look at.

The Ghostbusters hanging out with all these crazy supernatural events is just plain fun.The characters in the movie are like pop culture legends now.

"""Who ya gonna call?""","Three unemployed parapsychology professors set up shop as a unique ghost removal service.I had never seen Ghostbusters two days ago. It wasn't because I didn't want to, or because it looked too kiddie, but because other movies got in the way. I always told myself I was going to watch it: tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, or the following day after that, but I never did.. Finally, yesterday to be exact, I watched it off of Netflix and it was more than I hoped for... Ghostbusters is just genius. There really isn't any more explanation. The lines were hit right, it was a breakthrough in terms of it's special effects and film-making, and it remains a classic. I cannot believe I haven't seen it beforehand. It's completely fun, and unbelievably clever. I'm not going to run through what adds up to make a movie, but only to explain what I liked, and that's all you'll need in order to see it, if you haven't already...The humor. It's surely not a comedy-driven film, but it surely is funny. Everybody packed in lots of witty one-liners and such, but Bill Murray is the man who does it best. The film is somewhat of a parody of films in general, but packs in a lot more than parodies usually do. If Ghostbusters had no comedy, then Ghostbusters wouldn't be Ghostbusters; plain and simple...Bill Murray. Yes, him. He basically drives the film itself packing it in with much more than it needs to be. His one-liners were hilarious, and his antics were dry but comedic. If it weren't for him (which him also tying in with the comedy) the film wouldn't be THE film...FUN! The movie is pure fun, and it was made for the 80's. It was a breakthrough in everything possible, and it seemed to have influenced much of what we have today. It's comedy was straight up hilarious. Bill Murray drives the film with his one-liners and his dry wit. The 'supporting' cast, which lines up behind Bill Murray, also shoots the film with their infectious chemistry and charisma, and makes the film what it is. If you don't like Ghostbusters, you cannot like anything. It's more than just a ""kid"" film, it's all things possible.

Why Ghostbusters Works,"You take Ivan Reitman's light-hearted directorial style and ground it with Dan Aykroyd's genuine occult obsession, which is shrugged away by Bill Murray's smirky nihilism.

It developed very fast and didn't give much of a build up, which isn't necessarily a problem. Bill Murray and Dan Akroyd were amazing. Bill Murray has always been hilarious and it reminded me of an older version of him in Groundhog Day.I also enjoyed Sigourney Weaver. She looked very youthful and beautiful in this movie.

Never to be bettered,"'Ghostbusters' was one of those films where lightning just struck in all the right places and was - seemingly - impossible to recapture. The story is so simple that it's amazing no one ever tried to do it before - four men set up a business capturing ghosts. End of. It could have been awful. I'm pleased to say it was perfect.Recently, I've read that all sorts of actors were attached the to the project before the final cast was signed. I don't know what it would be like with anyone but Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson (oh, and Sigourney Weaver is along for the ride, too - no bad thing to also have 'Ripley' on the cast list). They made a direct sequel which - sort of - worked (I liked it, but the popular consensus is that it was vastly inferior to its predecessor) and then a half remake/half reboot in 2016 (and the least said about that, the better). Neither direct attempts, nor any half-baked rip-offs ever lived up to the original and I doubt any ever will.Like I say, it's first and (possibly main) selling point is its simplicity. We get to know all major characters straight away and none require any lengthy plot explanations to 'explain' who they are and their various motivations. The action (i.e. appearance of the ghosts) happens almost within the first quarter of an hour and this is probably as good a time as any to make mention of the special effects - they're pretty fantastic, not just for 1984, but - believe it or not - basically stand up to scrutiny to this day (okay, so the 'dogs' look a little 'stop motion,' but apart from that...).I could say that the uber-catchy theme song and subsequent cry of ""Who you gonna' call?"" went some way to establish the film's hold on popular culture, but, ultimately, it wouldn't be anything without humour. The cast are - as mentioned - perfect and play off each other like few ensembles can ever do. Just as the special effects hole up today, so does the humour - effortlessly.If you're looking for comedy - look no further. The fact that it's - loosely - sci-fi is secondary to the charm of its stars. In many of today's films (and I'm thinking of the Marvel movies, mainly) many lament the lack of a 'strong villain' for our heroes to go up against. Here, interestingly, there isn't really one central bad-guy to fight. I suppose you could argue that a pen-pushing civil servant who's constantly trying to shut the Ghostbusters down is a 'semi-baddie,' but the 'true' nasty doesn't really show up until the final act, but, that doesn't really matter. The film is perfect and will truly stand the test of time. I can't see today's generation being any the less taken with its brilliance.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Gags & special effects with star names,"My review was written in May 1984 after a Times Square screening.Columbia's ""Ghostbusters"" is a lavishly produced but only intermittently impressive all-star comedy lampoon of supernatural horror films. Closer in scale at an estimated $32,000,000 negative cost to ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" and ""1941"" than modest spoofs such as the Bob Hope-Paulette Goddard ""The Ghost Breakers"", pic looks to good but not fantastic results in the summer b.o. Sweepstakes. (2023 NOTE: Oops! I was wrong in my prognostication!)
Originally conceived as a John Belushi-Dan Aykroyd vehicle called ""Ghostsmashers"" before Belushi's death in 1982, ""Ghostbusters"" under producer-director Ivan Reitman makes a fundamental error reminiscent of the atypical 1946 Abbott & Costello picture ""The Little Giant"": featuring a set of top comics but having them often work alone rather than as a team throughout. This format, together with the usual pauses to gaze at spectacular special effects, creates a comedy that works in fits and starts.The Harold Ramis-Dan Aykroyd screenplay (which, curiously, gives its writer-actors the least interesting of the lead roles), takes as its main premise the idea played straight in Michael Winner-Jeffrey Konvitz' 1977 feature ""The Sentinel"": a Manhattan apartment building inhabited by beautiful Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) and her nerd neighbor Louis Tully (Rick Moranis) becomes the gateway for demons from another dimension (led by the Sumerian demigod Gozer) to invade the Earth.To battle Gozer and other motley phantasms come the Ghostbusters, a rio of scientists who have been kicked off campus and are now freelance ghost catchers for hire. Dan Aykroyd is the gung-ho scientific type, Bill Murray is faking competency (he's had no higher education in parapsychology) and using the job to meet women, while Harold Rmis is he trio's technical expert; later, Ernie Hudson joins the tea as an out-of-work black man hardup for a job.Weaver is their first customer, after she has a poltergeist episode in her kitchen Servicing various other clients en route to fame, the Ghostbusters stockpile a horde of trapped ghosts which are set free when an EPA investigator (William Atherton) opposes their unsafe procedures. Soon after Weaver is possessed by a demon known as The Gatekeeper and Moranis by one called The Key Master. Together, they open the way for Gozer's invasion and a very flashy special visual effects climax.Within the top-heavy cast, it's Murray's picture, as tghe popular comedian deadpans, ad libs and does an endearing array of phsycial schtick. Aykroyd, trying too hard, gers vitually no laughs, Ramis is along for the ride and Moranis is underutilized but quite effective when given screen time. Weaver is deliciously sexy both before and after her possession, addin heavy eye makep and vamp poses to effect the transition. Annie Potts is cute as the heores' secretary.Unde multi-Oscar-winner Richaer Edlund's supervision, the film's visual effects offer quite a show, comparable in quality (most unusual for a spoof) to the targeted horror films. Several effects, such as a monster in the library and floating wraiths, recall earlier Edlund assignments ""Poltergeist"" and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". Elsewhere, both puppet and stop-motion animation monsters provide original contributions, combining with top notch animation and design work to yield satisfying results. Problem is the effects are far better than the film vehicle containing them.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

"Re-viewing ""Ghostbusters""","At the risk of raining on anyone's nostalgia, I recently felt compelled to watch the original ""Ghostbusters"" film after not having seen it in decades and was struck by how odd the experience seemed in light of modern-day concerns. ""Ghostbusters,"" for anyone new to the planet Earth, is the story, remade into an unsuccessful reboot, of some people who create a spiritual-entity-pest control business, get in over their heads with a demonic overlord and end up saving the world, or at least a major city.I liked the movie as a kid and was in the prime demographic for it, being young, white, male and a fan of ""Star Wars,"" ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""Poltergeist."" ""Ghostbusters"" is a fun 80s time capsule romp that doesn't seem to exist for any reason other than to entertain and has a great many memorable moments, and I wouldn't suggest that anyone who likes it not watch it, but like many movies past their prime this one seems different watching it today, and it made me think:1) The ""ghosts"" are actually demons--this happened in the poltergeist-free ""Poltergeist"" film too. The ghosts are generally not representatives of dead souls and the final battle is essentially with a demon. It probably would have been too much to portray demons and religious matters in a mainstream, big-budget comedy back then, but that's what the film seems to be about (particularly the scenes with a possessed Sigourney Weaver paying homage to ""The Exorcist,"" which would have made more sense then than it probably would now). It's interesting that a 1984 version of the underworld casts what looks like a spandex-clad female dancer from ""Xanadu"" as its devil.2) Speaking of which, women, in the world of ""Ghostbusters"" are either grouchy receptionists, objects of desire at the mercy of clueless men or neutered hags. The ideal woman is apparently cold, statuesque, well-to-do, does aerobics and is only ""released"" from the prison of herself by wearing make-up and slinky dresses. It's weird to see ""Ripley"" as a damsel in distress, to say the least. There are no healthy romances in the world of ""Ghostbusters""--the end credits suggest Weaver and Murray end up together but it's apparent it wouldn't last.3) People of color aren't in prominent roles. It seems Eddie Murphy was supposed to be in the film and one wonders how it might have been different--would he have stolen the show from Murray? Or would he have played another embarrassing caricature? As it stands in the movie it's clear--it's a white, (straight) male world and everyone else is a supporting character. I was there at the time and that wasn't the case in real life, even if it was often the case in the movies. We have plenty of movies that represent ""the rest of us"" nowadays and it's great that things have leveled off enough that seeing a movie as homogenous as this now feels kind of odd. Oh, and all the smoking--indoors yet--is funny too. The world has truly changed.3) Science is something only ""nerds"" are into, and nerds are to make fun of and brush off even if they have the power to use their brains to save the world. In the world of this film, the only thing that matters is one-liners and taking jabs at everyone and everything that one thinks is dumb, which one sees echoes of in today's society (whether ""Ghostbusters"" is to blame for teaching generations fed on TV this outlook or not is another matter).4) Bill Murray, once again doing his ""anarchist/lovable creep"" routine, looks really bored, maybe even irritated most of the movie, and I can't help but think a lot of people confuse actors with the roles they play. Back in the day, every guy I knew wanted to be Murray...getting away with being rude, obnoxious, lazy and stupid, making fun of everything he doesn't understand while indulging in bravado and cynicism to mask his insecurities, preying on women by annoying them until they give in, being a big, paunchy dummy who loves rock and roll and fast women, but always with a punchline at the right moment to distract people from his lack of attractive attributes by disarming them with humor. He isn't particularly witty despite his witticisms; he's the ultimate underachiever and the realization of what people outside the US see as an ugly American: oblivious, entitled, obnoxious, bloated and unable to keep his mouth shut, even when he's shooting himself in the foot. That this character was once considered a hero and someone people tried to emulate, something I never understood even as a teen (and I liked Murray's films) says a lot about where we are these days.5) Young boomers of the day once doubled over in laughter at the idea that a mythical pop-consumer icon, a symbol representing a false conception of a lost era in the shape of a doughy, fat, monstrous, giant white male, would potentially be society's downfall.I distinctly remember the sequel to ""Ghostbusters"" being underwhelming and realizing I had finally, perhaps, grown too old for these kinds of movies. At the least, the sequel didn't have anything like the same bite or charm the original had. I don't know that anyone but people my age care about ""Ghostbusters"" anymore, or even if they should (even as a new reboot is on the way apparently), but if nothing else, despite being problematic in some ways, the film remains a unique entity, a big-budget comedy that treads a line between humor, horror, science and speculation while dazzling the eye with pretty colors and the mind with intriguing, imaginative ideas. Oh, and Rick Moranis is, as always, wonderful.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

There was zero fun zero comedy and pretty much zero ghosts. All the modern things we have now would have been a payground for ghosts to get up to allsorts of mischief and mayhem.

I Ain't Afraid Of No Ghosts,"Ah, Ghostbusters, a movie that took your imagination to it's limits. From sucking up ghosts with proton packs, to a giant walking marshmallow mascot going on a rampage though New York, Ghostbusters is considered to be a childhood favourite by many. The movie was such a success back in the 80's. Much fallowed the films release such as a sequel, a cartoon series, a line of video games and action figures. Everything about Ghostbusters is fun to watch weather it be watching a ghost get grabbed by the proton streams and being sucked into a ghost trap with amazing special effects, or it be hearing the siren from the ecto-1 as it speeds passed, not to mention the awesome theme song. The gadgets that the Ghostbusters are equipped with are also very cool my favourite being the ghost vacuum that is on the roof of the ecto-1. The Ghostbusters face off against Gozer and her minions and must stop them from destroying the city Having all that said, Ghostbusters is a movie that people look back on and remember the feeling they got after watching it for the first time as kids, and that feeling is a feeling no one will ever forget.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Very funny,"Ghostbusters is one of those films that you can watch again and again and always find something new to laugh at.  The relationship between Venkman, Stantz and Spengler is great.  The one liners that they throw out are worth remembering.  Rick Moranis is exceptionally funny, playing the really odd neighbor Louis. He later becomes possesed by a demon and calls himself Vinz Glortho.  His explanation of things to come is also extremely funny, made even better because he believes it.  The visual effects still hold up and the climax of the film still gives me a good laugh.  How many films end with a 100 foot marshmallow man stomping around the island of Manhattan?",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
a film that has had a lasting effect on film history,"If someone says Who ya gonna call?..Everyone knows what to say. Ghostbusters successfully melded comedy and big budget special effects. Since then it has been copied countless ways (ahem, MiB) Aykroyd, Ramis, Murray, and Hudson face demons from hell, always with a witty comeback. The movie basically kicks ass with a great special edition DVD.  Oh yeah and they did turn the word slime into a verb.  GB2 was good, not great, but a worthy followup.  Hopefully GB3 will someday come to pass.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Classic 80's comedy.,"My Take: Hilarious comedy carried by a hilarious ensemble cast, gimmicky effects, and big laughs.A classic for bringing both special effects and comedy together successfully, GHOSTBUSTERS actually still holds up today. It's still a funny and elaborate fantasy with some fun special effects (which may not be as good in today's standards, but still enjoyable) and some very humorous performances by Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis as the three leads. It's not as great as it might have been, but what do I know, this one is still very good.Director Ivan Reitman keeps things as lively as possible. The early special effects work on creatures and spirits (including the infamous Marshmallow Man) are fun to look at. They're not as good as today's, and these may be even considered low-tech, but they have something some of today's special effects have, and that's imagination. It took some imagination to create strange wonders as these, and they're worth looking at.Other than special effects, the real appeal of GHOSTBUSTERS comes from the actors and the rest of the crew. Lead actors, as well as supporting characters like the ones played by Sigourney Weaver, Annie Potts, Rick Moranis and Ernie Hudson, are very well played. The script is finely rewarding with funny one-liners to great jokes. It's also flavored with parodies (THE EXORCIST mainly) and some in-jokes. GHOSTBUSTERS proves that, even with the distractions of special effects, a comedy can still be funny at the same time.Rating: ****1/2 out of 5.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Watching it again now I'm older...,"I remember constantly renting Ghostbusters (1984) from the video store as a child. Perhaps the constant barrage of this film upon my childhood (both on video and television) has clouded my judgement, but I consider it to be among the greatest films ever made. Many scenes still remain in my mind as some of the strongest images of my childhood (Marshmallow Man, Library Ghost).This film has all you could ask for. Watching it as a child, I did not fully appreciate the film. I wanted to BE a Ghostbuster and picked up on only the in-your-face and broad visual gags. Watching it now at the ripe old age of 18, I notice so many more subtle pieces of dialogue and realise the film to be totally tongue-in-cheek.Considering it was made in 1984, the film has a timeless quality which has given it a longer shelf life than many other '80s films. The special effects are still awesome and the dialogue and visual humour has the power to make you roll about laughing. The Stay Puft Marshmallow Man especially remains one of the best visual gags in film history. Roll on Ghostbusters 3....",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Terrific Entertainment,"If anybody hasn't seen this movie, go out and buy it right now. The DVD version is terrific, but any form of this flick is a must-have. I wholeheartedly say that this movie is one of my all time favorites. Watch it over and over agin and you'll see: the jokes never bore, the laughter is always flowing. Ghostbusters is a Hollywood Smash.The story in Ghostbusters is about 3 scientists at Columbia University: Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Raymond Stanz (Dan Aykroyd), and Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis). They are the crack team in the parapsychology department but soon find that their antics push them out of the University and onto the street. With new technology, they open up their own business: they investigate and eliminate ghosts in New York. At first, Dana Barett (Sigourney Weaver) is their only customer. She has had some ghostly apparitions in her apartment and needs help, and Venkman especially wants to help her. But soon, all of New York City is engulfed in spooks and Dana, along with her eccentric neighbor Louis (Rick Moranis), become the focus of summoning Gozer, a vicious evil that could easily destroy the world. With a new recruit, Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson), the Ghostbusters set out to save the world.This movie is an excellent comedy, thanks to a great script by co-stars Aykroyd and Ramis. They setup the characters wonderfully, so that each adds something unique to the wacky group. Murray and Moranis are given the best material of their careers and Aykroyd, Ramis and Annie Potts have a collection of zingers. The story is made believable, in spite of the obstacles, and the visual gags plus the sharp dialogue make for an unforgettable comedy classic.The visual effects are also very good. They help deliver a couple of nice scares in the movie like when Dana gets captured by the Terror Dog or when, as Zuul, a minion of Gozer, she telepathically destroys her own apartment. Richard Edlund and company has done a fine job.All these things, along with the great title theme, make for a film that lived up to and exceeded the hype. Everything about this movie clicks; nothing seems to be out of balance. I really loved this movie and I think that everyone else would too. Go out and pick up a copy of Ghostbusters today.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
There's something strange in the neighborhood,"I'm a kid from the 80's and this was one of the first films I saw, this is one of my all time favorite films. This wasn't just a film it was a phenomenon it had an animated series called ""The Real Ghostbusters"" which is one of my favorite animated shows and was the source that lead me to see the film; along with it's underrated sequel series ""Extreme Ghostbusters"". There were also toys, video games, a sequel which I like, comic books there aren't many films now that can really generate this kind of phenomena, especially one just like any great ghost story is timeless.This film isn't entirely concerned about plot, even though there is one the whole film builds up to that the further it goes. It's really focused on the characters and what happens. I really love how it has the proper balance of special effects and comedy, both are used the right way and the right reasons. I really like this fantasy world the film has created where it feels one foot in reality but also one foot away. The special effects are just great because their practical, they've created some memorable ghosts like the trademark ghost Slimer, But the ones that impressed me the most are Gozer and the demon hounds whom are the main villains the film builds up to and they don't disappoint they made me nervous when I was a kid, Gozer having being a god which means limitless power so yeah that's a tough customer. However I also really loved seeing that otherworldly temple behind them which just looks beautiful and eerily strange, reminiscent of something out of Lovecroftian tales. I really love the weapons of the Ghostbusters those proton packs and traps, seeing how they work made me want to get one. And lets not forget the music which is just great there a plenty of memorable songs like the infamous Ghostbusters theme which is no surprise one of my favorites movie themes, however my favorite song in the film is actually ""Save the Day"", it's just one of those songs that really make you get going.However it's the characters how they deliver their lines and how they talk to one another that really drives this film. Their funny because they play it straight, their talking and acting like regular people would, and all have unique persona's. We see a barrage of clever jokes, one liners, and quotes that are all delivered at the right timing.Peter Venkman played brilliantly by one of my favorite actors Bill Murray. What I like is the fact that his character has a really sarcastic, smart alec , slightly slacker mannerism (though he could be smart sometimes if he wants to be). He just has a lot of key moments from the time when he interacts with his girlfriend Dana (Sigurney Weaver) who unfortunately is possessed by one of Gozer's demon dogs Zool was really funny, or even a small moment when he encounters Slimer and reacts a bit with nervousness then in the aftermath he delivers that infamous sarcastic line ""He slimed me."" Raymond Stantz: Dan Ackroyd is at his best in this one, shame like with most comedians he never really retained most of that comedic energy again. His character is well a geek, super smart but has a sort of childlike naivety attached to him. I loved that moment when he interacts with Gozer which believe it or not is my favorite quote from the movie; ""As a representative of New York City, I ask you to cease and desist all supernatural activity, and return to your point of origin or the nearest parallel dimension."" I know that seems to be both the smartest and dumbest thing to say, but then again what the heck else can one say to a ancient evil Samarian God.Egon Spenglaer: Harold Ramis plays this character with dry wit. He's basically all brain which might make it a little difficult when it comes to fruitful interaction. Like some of those little moments with Secretary Janine Malniz (Annie Potts) who flirts with him from time to time but never really gets him which I though was sweet and funny in a quirky sense (this of course is built more in both animated series).This film is funny from it's small subtle moments that work in a big way as well as it's big moments that have the equal affect but in a small way (if you catch my drift). One of my favorite moments are Egon's interview with Lousi Tully (Rick Moranis) who is possessed by another demon dog of Gozer's Vince. It's just funny seeing the looks both Janine and Egon display when Vince talks about a couple of Gozer's past forms and what he, she or whatever Gozer was did at the time. Egon and Janine's faces reflect exactly what I'm thinking at that moment ""What in the hell is he talking about."" What Vince says is the truth but just the strangeness of the content and the way his says it is just downright funny.And of course the big moment when the infamous Stay Puff marshmallow man shows up. I just laughed my heard off, obviously a small homage and satirical parody on those big monster movies like Godzilla and King Kong. Mr. Stay Puff is one of my favorite super sized monsters, he's both cutely funny but also menacing and scary at the same time.If you guys have any ghosts, you can call and trust these guys.Rating: 4 stars",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

One of the most entertaining movies of all time.,"""Ghostbusters"" is just one of those movies that you must have seen at least once in your life. Although I can't think of a person who hasn't already. Lot's of people grew up with this movie and lot's of people will remain to, cause it's a movie that just never will be outdated, the entertainment value is just too high for that to happen.I think the power of ""Ghostbusters"" are the main characters and the actors that portray them. Bill Murray is hilarious as always and Dan Aykroyd shows why he was one of the greatest comedians of the 80's. William Atherton was wonderful as 'villain' and Rick Moranis does what he can do best; play the nerdy loser. The cast is just simply perfect and I haven't even mentioned Sigourney Weaver, Harold Ramis, Annie Potts or Ernie Hudson yet.The music is also spot on perfect. No, I'm not just talking about the Ray Parker Jr. theme song but mainly about the Elmer Bernstein soundtrack which in my opinion is underrated.The movie is mainly just fun to watch and is highly entertaining and is filled with some wonderful and memorable moments. The early special effects look acceptable but by todays standards they look pretty fake at times.Lot's of people always praise the ending, not I however. I don't really like the ending, never did really. Sure the huge marshmallow man is just fantastic and highly original but the whole Gozer thing is just a bit underused maybe. I have the feeling that the movie's ending could have been done way more spectacular. For some reason it doesn't really blend in with the rest of the movie.Yet ""Ghostbusters"" remains one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen and is one of those movie's I have fond childhood memories of.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
One of the Top 10 Blockbusters of all Time!,"Ghostbusters may be the greatest comedy of all time because it had great acting, a great script, great special effects, and great directing.Starring: Bill Murray (Rushmore, Kingpin), Dan Aykroyd (The Blues Brothers), Harold Ramis (Stripes, As Good as it Gets), Ernie Hudson (Oz, The Substitute), Rick Moranis (Spaceballs, Big Bully), Sigourney Weaver (Alien 1-4), Annie Potts (Toy Story I & II).After spoting a ghost at the New York Public Library, Dr. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Dr. Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), Dr. Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) who are college professors, return to the university to discover that they are being fired. They except it like gentlemen and quickly think up a plan to go into a business for themselves. That is, they will catch ghosts and entrap them. So, they immediatley begin their business by buying an abandoned fire department and making it their building. They hire Jannine Melnitz (Annie Potts) as their secretary. They're business becomes an immediate success and life goes wonderful for them.But, when a single woman named Dana Barret (Sigourney Weaver) sees an image of a demon from hell in her refrigerator, she immediatley goes to the Ghostbusters for help which leads to her becoming Venkman's love interest. In the mean time, the E.P.A. is threatening to have the business shut down due to unlicensed nuclear power use.Dana and her neighbor Louis Tully (Rick Moranis) become possessed by other demons and talk about the main god from hell coming to rule earth. This puts the Ghostbusters on their biggest assignment of all.I don't want to spoil the rest.Great special effects from Richard Edlund (Raiders of the Lost Ark, Star Wars) and a great screenplay by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis!Produced and directed by the criticaly acclaimed Ivan Reitman (Evolution, Twins, Junior, Dave, Meatballs, Stripes, Kindergarten Cop), and co-produced by Joe Medjuck (Road Trip, All of Ivan Reitman's movies).Ghostbusters is the greatest comedy of all time and is a fun movie for kids especially!I also recommend Ghostbusters II!!!!!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
A classic,"In my opinion, the eighties has never been a great decade when it comes to movies (music, hairstyles and fashion weren't any better, but I'm not going to discuss that on this website). There are only a couple of movies, made at that time, that I still consider worth watching and ""Ghost Busters"" is definitely one of them.When three weird scientists / professors lose their grant and their jobs at the university, where they studied the occult and paranormal occurrences, they have to find a new way of making money. They decide to go into business as a ghost extermination company called 'Ghostbusters'. At first people react sceptical and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) tries to shut them down, but soon enough business is booming. Especially when an ancient god named Gozer is threatening to take over the city, no-one doubts about their capabilities anymore. But this gigantic enemy is stronger than they have ever met before and they can't be sure that they will be able to handle him...Despite the fact that this movie was created in 1984, the ghosts still look very good. They would look a lot better if done with today's techniques of course, but keep in mind that they didn't have the same possibilities in the early eighties, and than you'll see what a formidable performance this was. And not only the special effects are more than OK. So is the entire story and the acting. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis are excellent as the three 'mad' scientists, but the others, like for instance Sigourney Weaver and Annie Potts, were nice to watch as well. The main problem that I had with this movie, if you can call it that, was that it was too short. They build the entire movie up to a very good climax and then all a sudden, everything is finished. I sure wanted to keep watching a bit longer.Overall this is a movie that deserves to be called a classic. It may perhaps look a bit dated by today's standards, but it still offers plenty of fun. That's why I give this movie a 7.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

He can act, too, something I've known for quite a while. So if you want a dark comedy with well deserved laughs, call Ghostbusters.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Pure Genius,"Hands down one of the funniest movies of the 1980's, and probably one of the top ten comedies of all time.  Bill Murray is hysterical as Venkman, which would serve as the formula for his many roles to come.  Dan Akyroyd gives his best performance before he melted away into obscurity, and Ernie Hudson and Harold Ramis are great yet under rated for their roles.  Rick Moranis and a Giant Marshmallow man steal the show.The movie is hilarious by going to the extremes and throwing out all realism, yet filling the jokes with witty and sharpe dialogue.  It reminds me a lot of the middle years of hte Simpsons.Yet what makes this movie so great is its impact.  It single handedly created a sub-genre, sci-fi comedy.  As well, it was a phenomenon of toys, games, cartoons, and that awful yet irresistable cereal.

"Easily, one of the best comedies ever made.","Sometimes, just sometimes, filmmakers, actors, writers, and musicians can come together so flawlessly on every level, that they don't just create a movie.  They create a film that will not only be loved by the generation of it's time, but will also be enjoyed by the many generations to come. Ghostbusters is one of these films.As our story opens, the boys are investigating a possible ghost sighting at a library, and it is here that they come up with the idea of actually capturing and holding a ghost indefinitely. Thinking how lucrative the rights alone could be, they decide to go into business as professional paranormal exterminators.  They aren't taken very seriously at first and have trouble finding clients.  Until one day, a nice young woman wanders into their office and tells them about strange goings on in her apartment. As they investigate her case further, it is soon realized that she isn't being plagued by a small time spook.  The ghosts in her apartment building have bigger plans, and are in fact trying to bring something or someone into our world using this building as the door.  And as it turns out, only the Ghostbusters can save us.Director Ivan Reitman has done a tremendous job in his direction of this movie.  Instead of relying heavily on special effects, he lets his characters tell the story.  Yes, there are a lot of effects in the film, including the introduction of one of the biggest visitors to ever come to New York City.  Fans of the film know exactly who I am talking about, and the ""character"" leaves several indelible impressions upon the city.  But alas, I am getting away from the terrific human cast that is also in the picture.  Bill Murray gives one of his best performances as Dr. Peter Venkman, a smooth-talking ""game show host"" of a scientist who is always using his scientific credentials as a guise to meet women.  Note the scene in which he is doing an electric shock ""experiment"" on a pretty coed and her nervous male friend.  It's hilarious.  And also, Rick Moranis as Sigourney Weaver's nerdy neighbor Louis, who delights in playing Parchesi at his parties and always manages to lock himself out of his house time and time again.Blessed with a great script written by Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd, Ghostbusters is a truly great comedy, filled with quirky characters, great visual effects, and a good sounding soundtrack.  Who honestly hasn't shouted ""Ghostbusters!"" when you hear the phrase ""Who ya gonna call?"".

Bill Murray's sarcastic persona is at its best here, and proves that with a witty script, provided by co-stars Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd, he can do almost anything.

Very quotable and funny,I was a fan of the cartoon series on The Ghostbusters and the movie hasn't disappointed me one bit.It's very funny right from the start. Evergreen humour is this film's USP. Actor Bill Murray essays the role of Dr. Venkman and is highly entertaining as a source of nonchalant humour. The sci-fi special effects are overall quite impressive for the 80's but even those lack a ghoulish air. Every single minute of the film is light and comical.

If You Can Catch This One on the Big screen...DO!,"To be sure,this film is a modern comedy classic no mater what medium you see see it on. BUt my first viewing of this was on the big screen,and it was breathtaking! Perhaps the memories of my youth have dolled this experience up,but I still feel like you get the full effect of the special effects and music of this picture when you see it on large screen. I was twelve when ""Ghostbusters"" stormed through theaters,breaking box office records for a comedy,and if I didn't already have some sense of admiration for the comedic talents of Bill Murray,Dan Aykroyd,Harold Ramis and Rick Moranis before this movie,I would after.In case you are not familiar with the story,here goes: Three paranormal professors(Murray,Aykroyd and Ramis) are kicked out of their cushy,tenured jobs at a prestigious New York college(NYU?) and decide to go into business as paranormal investigators and erstwhile ghost hunters. They always seem to be close to but never quite able to capture,evidence of the supernatural around New York. That changes when they become the successful,""last avenue"" answer to corralling a rather nasty ghoul who is creating havoc in a swanky four-star hotel(The Waldorf?). This leads to a string of successful ""Ghost busting"" all over the region, and it leads them back into the life of one concert musician(Sigourney Weaver,in her first chance to flex her comedic muscle)who happens to be siting on top of a particularly awesome din of supernatural activity on the loom. Rick Moranis steals his scenes as the dweeby accountant neighbor of Weaver's,and Ernie Hudson joins on near the end as a no-nonsense guy who believes in the Ghostbusters' mission,in spite of his better instincts.Rounding out the cast are Annie Potts(pre-Designing Women)as the dryly unenthused secretary and William Atherton as the weasly EPA rep and ostensible villain here(an 80s era dig). Director Ivan Reitman,while somewhat of an inconsistent filmmaker(""Stripes"",""Twins"",""DAve"" and ""Junior""),is very deft and clever in balancing effects and eye-candy with comedy,keeping the film both light AND powerful.I realize that films that have been around as long as ""Ghostbusters""(which will turn twenty-one this June,if you're counting) rarely get to see the insides of movie theaters anymore,but if by some chance you're at a movie festival or college campus that is showing this on the large screen,I highly recommend you go catch it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

"Entertaining, but starting to get a little dated","When Ghostbusters first came out I thought it was one of the best films ever.  In the year 1984 I was just old enough to begin to appreciate films, I was about 8 at the time.  Compared to the special effects they can pull off today, the FX in Ghostbusters appear to be a little dated.  But the story is still there and as vivid as ever.  The cast in Ghostbusters is one of the best ensemble casts I have seen, there was so much great comic talent.  The story is original, and the chosen destructor at the films end was the best so called villain I have ever seen.  Although in visual effects the film may have dwindled, its essence is still very much there, which still makes it one of the most entertaining films released in the last quarter century.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

A Classic,"Comedy, action and scares. What more could you want from a film ?(Oh yeah, and a dash of romance too). An original idea by Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ivan Reitman that preceded M.I.B by over a decade and is far more fun to watch than the over contrived and far too serious X Files. Great performances by the whole cast, with Bill Murray at his wittiest and deadpan best. A movie that does not take itself too seriously and is fun for all the family.

"""This Mr Stay-Puff isn't so bad...""","**BIG SCREEN**Its hard for me to even type that line without thinking of how incredibly funny it was to see and hear Bill Murray deliver it when this movie came out. This simply put is the movie that got me into movies. I talked about it for weeks after I saw it @ 11. Everyone in it does a superb job. Ray Parker Jr. ripped off Huey Lewis, but other than that, A GREAT FINISHED PROJECT. At the time quite advanced on the special effects but that is only another excuse for laughs.

A Good Funny Film,"Ghost Busters is supposedly one of the greatest comedies ever to hit the big screen. I'll admit although the special effects are old, they still are a marvel to look at from so many years ago. I also enjoyed the actors who played in this movie I feel that they all did really well at their jobs. A lot of them had funny moments. My only complaint is that I did not have enough laughs. I felt that there were parts that were supposed to be funny but seemed liked they were out of place.Starring as the awesome four in this film are Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson. Murray is good at being a smart mouthed ""doctor"". Aykroyd is good at making himself look like a complete science nerd with the way he talks. Ramis' character, although somewhat awkward is funny to watch too. As for Hudson, I've always enjoyed the way he makes his character look and act. Even Sigourney Weaver from Alien (1979) has some interesting moments.Together these actors come out on top and make the film very enjoyable. The only problem I didn't seem to understand is the humor in this film. Yeah it was funny for the most part but some moments seemed out of context, or just plain weird. Either it's me because I'm from another generation or it's just that it wasn't that funny. I'm not sure. When I heard people talk about Ghost Busters I expected to have gut busting laughter. I did laugh but not a lot and not out loud. For a movie of this magnitude of fans, you'd think it would be hard to resist, but I didn't cling to me like it did to other viewers.I liked the music that was played in the background. Composed and conducted by Elmer Bernstein, it has jokey attitude, which helps this movie with its comedic moments. I liked how the tuba played as the main title came on. It was because of that intro, I got a better understanding of how serious Director Ivan Reitman wanted this film to be.The special effects are still lovable in this film. Seeing the Ghost Busters' use their equipment, such as the beam guns, brings back fond memories of watching Disney's Black Hole (1979). My favorite moment is when Bill Murray's character has an encounter with a green slime ghost. It's fun to watch and to imagine of how at the time, something like that could have been pulled off. Of course there are parts that are much better than this but I don't want to give them away. Overall I enjoyed the film, even with the setbacks I had when it ended.Ghost Busters is a funny science fiction comedy with some really unique special effects. Director Ivan Reitman picked a good cast for this film and they work well together to boot.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Ghostbusters (1984) Review:,"Still holds up enough.Dated to a fault, but not without its moment's.(B-)",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
A childhood favorite that sticks with me...,"""Ghost Busters"" was released the summer of the year I was born and I was very young when I first saw it. I immediately fell in love with it. It was funny and, at the time, a little frightening (I remember the Terror Dogs scaring the crap out of me). It is probably one of the most fun films I've seen. The entire movie almost has a cartoon-ish feel to it.The movie is the brainchild of Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis and stars some of the greatest comic actors of the decade. Aside from starring Aykroyd and Ramis, the film also boasts Bill Murray and Rick Moranis. The group has the perfect chemistry for the team and play off each other beautifully. Sigourney Weaver plays Murray's love interest and the victim of an ancient Sumerian god's attempted resurrection.The special effects are definitely a bit dated. Looking back on the stop-motion animated Terror Dogs now doesn't seem to have the same frightening effects. This doesn't hurt the movie one bit. I still love seeing Slimer and the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man terrorizing New York City.This is definitely one movie that ages well and is just as fun to watch now as it was then. ""Ghost Busters"" is a movie every child should grow up with.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Great, a film that just about anybody can like","Ghost Busters is a very original film. Where else will you see a group of odd balls who use packs on their backs with beams to catch ghosts all over New York. Where else will you see a green ghost that slimes people. The only place where you can find any of those things is Ghost Busters.This movie isn't a horror movie for any of you who watch it for that purpose, but it does have plenty of hilarious humor, action, and it is a very cool movie.This has a great cast of comedians that includes Bill Murray and Dan Akroyd. Sigourney Weaver is in this during her earlier years.Anybody can enjoy this movie. I saw this when I was about 6 years old and I have loved it ever since. The kids will like it for the action and the ghosts, everyone else who watches it will probably appreciate the humor in it. This isn't real scary, but I knew a 4 year old who watched this and he was pretty scared by it.Unfortunately, it is a bit dated. Many of the ghost effects that were amazing in 1984 are considered fake for today's standards. This was made before CGI first came around, so it is pretty good considering that.If you haven't seen this movie, watch it any time. It is a great movie and I'm sure you'll like it too.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Who you gonna call?,I tell you i'll give a call to the video store any day to rent this film. It has everything you need from action to Zippers. Bill murray's greatest role. Special Effects are something to ROMP about. I've been SLIMED and loved it ever since.,10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Still holds Up,"Ghostbusters is a one of a kind comedy. It works by combining traditional Aboott and Costello stuff and combines it with special effects. The effect of it all is mesmerizing. The special effects after over twenty years still hold up. The performances are also terrific. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, and even Ernie Hudson have never been better. They have such good chemistry together its impossible not to love them. I grew up watching it over an over as a kid. Many from my generation did. I loved it. I still remember sitting on the couch viewing this and the TV series over and over. It truly was pop-cultural phenomenon. It still is. Viewing it finally on DVD after years of video I can see it still stirs its viewers better than any comedy ever-made.

Bustin Indeed Does Make Me Feel Good,"But this movie, not that much.I was really really really hoping before watching this, that this wouldn't be one of those old popular famous movies considered classic and loved by everyone, that is not that great and people are mostly nostalgic about it, but unfortunately it is.I can safely say that it wasn't that much of fun movie for me, I've already forgotten the name of most characters, that's how much of a characterization was there.The movie -even though 1:45 hour - seems to rushes everything. We're thrown into the life of these supposed scientist. There isn't much characterization in here and we're just watching these ""scientists"" do some bustin.The plot is not that great either and the story structure is lacking.This really feels like a second part to a movie and it's because of the weak characterization and plot. Even though their car, their suits, their bustin gun, their appearances are all iconic, I still don't feel like I know any of the characters and it's like I'm watching them from afar, just casually watching them do stuff.And speaking of stuff, there are really not much ghost bustin in here aside from that green blob and the finale of the movie, all the bustin happens in a news compilation and most of the movie is just Bill Murray doing weird faces and sayin some dumb dialogue.Also, Dan Aykroyd's acting in this is really bad, especially the part when he first slides down the pole and says that they should buy that place. I was really stunned at that delivery, didn't know if it was intentional or he's just bad. In fact, most, if not all, of the acting is kinda fake to me.And as for the comedy? Is there really any comedy in it? I don't know, I don't really remember laughing at anything in this movie and if there was an attempt at comedy there it just wasn't my cup of tea I guess.It might've been a cool movie if you were a kid in the 80's and you grew up with it, but it's not that great for this day and age.All in all, it may not have worked for me, but it might work for you and be a great comedy and a fun movie for you, so watch it and decide for yourself.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"the best, the beautiful, the only.....(random comments on a classic)","I had started thinking about this comment on ghostbusters and believing that I would write a great review on what, I feel to be, one of the funniest movies ever. I realized that I can't write anything that would live up to the movie. So I'm just gonna spout. I think I've seen this movie about 400 times since it came out, and it never gets old. I guess this is a modern classic. What is so amazing is that after watching the dvd commentaries on 'busters, it feels that much more special, since from it's original conception it's had every chance to become one of the worst films of all time...but yet it turns out to be pure genius. It's no wonder Akroyd tries so hard to keep the ghostbusters flame burning. The way the entire movie comes together is amazing...everything works. Casting, effects, music.

Nostalgia is a dancer,"This is my favourite film. I'm not deluded, indeed I realise that Ghostbusters is not  the best film ever made, and is far from perfect. Yet just as fans of Star Wars seem to worship it as a manifestation of childish fantasy, so too is Ghostbusters for me. As a child I was entranced by the eccentric characters, mixture of supernatural events and bizarre technology, coupled with charming effects. As I grew older I understood the jokes, and realised the Stay Puft Marshmallow man was supposed to be funny and surreal, not scary as when I first saw it. This film made me want to go to university and hopefully meet a bunch of slacker scientists with bizarre ideas. Ghostbusters really does make you feel good, from the music, to Murray's quips. It's just a shame that Ghostbusters II sealed the fate of this franchise.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
A life-defining movie,"There are two movies I have seen more than any other, literally dozens and dozens, perhaps even a hundred times.  One is Spaceballs, the other is Ghostbusters.  As a child, I would watch them over and over, reciting line for line.  It's probably responsible for some of my mental problems (And obsessions with memorization), but the movie still stands up today as one of my favorites to watch.It seems silly to tell you the plot, not knowing what Ghostbusters is about is like being unfamiliar with the story of creation with Adam and Eve.  At least amongst my generation it stands as a rite of passage practically; when my friends learned that another friend had never seen it, he was practically shunned.  The omission was called a good deal of things, my favorite adjective was ""outrageous!""Anyway, Ghostbusters is of course, the tale of three parapsychologists, Doctors Peter Venkman, Ray Stanz, and Egon Spengler (Great character names, I can never forget them) who are kicked out of their professorships at Columbia University, and decide to go into business for themselves as a sort of exterminator service for people with ghost problems.  The film is mix of comedy, action, and scares, that somehow manages to hit just the right notes on all three, you scream and laugh at the same time.  It's a mix that few have been able to achieve since (The recent Evolution by Ghostbusters director Ivan Reitman has limited success in this same area).Everything about this movie clicks.  The cast, led by Bill Murray, seem so perfect in their roles.  Harold Ramis, for all his success elsewhere, shall always be Egon (Love the line when facing the Marshmellow Man, ""Sorry Venkman.  I'm terrified beyond the capacity for rational thought."")  The song by Ray Parker Jr. is of course famous, but Elmer Bernstein's excellent score has sadly been overlooked.  The effects, fairly cutting edge for the time, (mostly) hold up well, those that don't only make the ghostbusting scenes all the more humorous.Really, if you haven't seen this movie, you should be arrested.  It's on television more than Die Hard.  Watch it!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

This film was one of the most memorable Big Budget movies of the 1980's. The characters are so likable, often very funny and it has timeless feel to the story. Which it was created by Dan Arkroyd (The Blues Brothers, Coneheads, Dragnet), who had originally written different script and the premise took place in a future instead of present day. Which Arkroyd re-written the script with Harold Ramis (Analyze This, Caddyshack, Groundhog Day) to fleshing out the characters more. Ernie Hudson also co-stars as the new ""Ghostbuster"" in the group named Winston Zeddmore and Annie Potts as the ""Ghostbusters"" secretary.DVD has an good anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an fine Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.

One of the reasons why ""Ghostbusters"" worked so well over the years, because the humour is so good, the cast are first-rate, there's memorable Special Effects moments and the premise is certainly most amusing. Which all those things made ""Ghostbusters"" a modern classic with film critics and people of all ages still loved this movie.

A nice slice of the 80's,"You know why this film is so popular? It's not the subject matter... it's not the acting... not the humor, nor the music, the effects... what makes it so popular even after all these years is that it's a great slice of the 80's. The music, the clothing, the dialog, the script, the effects... everything is so definite 80's that the film is almost entirely irresistible. The plot is quite original and has a pretty good pace, as well. It's interesting to see these characters develop, even though they are kind of thin... and that each of them is basically the same type of role the respective actors usually portray. The acting is pretty standard. The characters are neither particularly well-written or well-developed. The humor is pretty good, but not really anything special. Not the best of 80's films... but good. The special effects vary, but mostly they're typically 80's... some of them are quite good, though. The dialog is good... some of it is very well-written... and most of it is nicely delivered as well. The film is about three scientists who are certain of the existence of ghosts, and as all of their hopes(or, rather, fears) are confirmed, they decide to make a team of ghost-fighters(or ghost-busters). The rest of the film deals with their fighting the ghosts in an entertaining, humorous and exciting manner. The film is rarely dull, never drags and is an instant classic due to the very 80's qualities of it. It's an entertaining and exciting ride through the 80's, and a film that won't be forgotten any time soon.

A fun film nastalgic of the 1980s,"One of the most popular films of the 1980s, Ghostbusters succeeded in capturing an audience and keeping a following well after the 1980s. The 1980s and this film seem to be tied together. It was a huge hit with a product range, a sequel, and a cartoon series -- not to mention the catchy theme song: 'I ain't afraid of no ghosts.' Ghostbusters is a fun film. The story centers around a group of men who start a business 'busting' ghosts. It's all very fantasy and super-hero themed with the ghost busters saving the city from the dooms of the spook-world, but it does have an element of comedy. In fact, it almost does not take itself seriously. Even the villain puffy mashmallow man is comical.The film is worth a watch, especially if you've seen it before and want to watch it again.

There are so many lines from this movie that I quote on an everyday basis it sometimes frightens me.Ulimately, the way that I know that this is one of those movies that will always rank at the top of the list, is the fact that I can watch it over and over, and never get bored with it.

The Original Ghost Busters are Back!,"Before the movie, before Dan Akroyd and Bill Murray went beyond Saturday Night, there was the live-action Saturday Morning Series called The Ghost Busters. Originally from Filmation's live-action library, The Ghost Busters starred famous F-Troop team Forrest Tucker and Larry Storch as Jake Kong and Eddie Spencer, and Tracy their gorilla. Unlike most of Filmation's live series, The Ghost Busters focused a bit more on humour than just being action with comedy relief. Basically, loosely using the 'Mission Impossible' schtick (heavily used in Saturday Morning spy shows) to obtain their assignments. Jake, Eddie and Tracy would deal with the likes of demented spirits, wacky vampires and other spectre and ghouls from haunting the mortal world. Humour was used a lot in the show, sometimes through classic visual stunts or puns. Case in point, when dealing with a vampire, Jake finds out one thing they fear is a wooden 'stake', whereas Tracy pulls out a wooden 'steak.' And when Eddie attempts to disclaim Tracy's attempt, he ends up getting a splinter from the 'steak.' However, because it was Saturday Morning TV, The Ghost Busters normally vanquished rogue spirits with a Polaroid-esquire device called the Dematerializer. As the name suggested, when fired at a ghost, the screen would appear with a blue screen effect and the ghost would 'dematerialize' out from the mortal world. Though I believe it only had one season in 1975, the series was often ran in syndication on Sunday mornings as well. Ironically, though the name was used for the film, there was no real connection between it and the series. Despite well-box office reviews, many still felt the Akroyd and Murray film did not capture the same fun as the original series. So in 1986, Filmation revived the series in animated form: Filmation's Ghostbusters. Here, however, the offspring of the original Ghost Busters and Tracy dealt with a nemesis called Prime Evil (think Terminator merged with a specter) and his ghoulish legion of ghosts. Whereas in the original series, the Ghost Busters simply obtained assignments from the mysterious Agent Zero. What really made Ghost Busters appealing for it's time, as with most Filmation Live Action, was it did have great storytelling, and really made the limited special effects work. Also for F-Troop fans, the comedy stilings of Tucker and Storch made the show enjoyable, and it was a wonder Filmation didn't consent with Hanna-Barbera for a spot on the Scooby-Doo Movies (since they aired about the same year). I'd definitely recommend this product for not only fans of the classic series, but for those who loved Forrest Tucker and Larry Storch, as well as a new generation of viewers.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"""Ghostbusters"" revisited","I can hardly believe I submitted a comment on the IMDb that not only gave ""Ghostbusters"" a paltry '6' rating, but also had the audacity to claim that the humor hadn't aged well. Since the dawn of my obsession with film, friends of a more casual viewership have always claimed that I take the medium far too seriously. And while I do think an intellectual embrace inspires thoughtful critique, I am not beyond getting giddy over a film just because I can, reasoning be damned.Case in point: ""Ghostbusters."" Back in 1986, I started my school career as an extroverted kindergartener with a love for Saturday-morning (and weekday-afternoon) cartoons. Out of all I'd watch, ""The Real Ghostbusters"" was the most entertaining; I was endlessly fascinated by the premise of 4 guys running around New York (plus other parts of the world and even outer space) with their 'positron rifles,' blasting deformed comic apparitions. In hindsight, this mixture of comic hijinks and supernatural mayhem is probably what piqued my long-standing love affair with horror films.I didn't actually view the film version of ""Ghosbusters"" until I was a well-ingrained fan of the TV show, to the point where I had to adjust to the difference in appearance of the live-action characters (as opposed the other way around). Despite this, I warmed up to the film instantly--I laughed my butt off and was amazed by Richard Edlund's brilliant FX (which look f*cking incredible to this day). Bill Murray's portrayal of the coolly sarcastic Peter Venkman is one of my all-time favorite performances (and cemented Murray as my favorite comic actor); the efforts of Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, and Ernie Hudson also contribute to an unmatched cooperative of quirky humor that works better than one might imagine.The premise of ""Ghostbusters"" is so utterly ridiculous that it's something of a miracle it works as well as it does. The script, by Aykroyd and Ramis (back when they knew 'funny'), involves our heroes sweeping the ghost population of NYC while dodging EPA toady Walter Peck (""Die Hard""'s William Atherton, in a hilariously straight performance); in the meantime, Venkman woos musician Dana Barret (Sigourney Weaver), whose apartment becomes a portal for ghoulish baddie Gozer to enter through. Over the course of the movie, we'll cross paths with people who transform into hell-hounds, a giant marshmallow man, and a ghoul that would give David Bowie a run for his androgynous money.Through all its absurdity, ""Ghostbusters"" works well because of the characterizations--while everyone has a distinctive personality quirk that is somewhat exaggerated, they are fleshed out to the extent of being believable and worth rooting for. Not once does the film lapse into farce at the expense of character, which makes the humor even bolder; this also helps make the Armageddon scenario that arises in the third act the stuff of Vonnegutian genius (in the face of imminent global catastrophe, humor keeps the human spirit aloft). Due credit should go to director Ivan Reitman, who manages a seamless interplay between the comedic and the horrific without allowing one to awkwardly dominate.Personally, ""Ghostbusters"" is a wonderfully nostalgic trip back to my childhood, a film that makes me grin as excitedly now as when I was 8...perhaps because nothing in it looks particularly dated (the effects actually look BETTER than anything that's come since), and the humor is still as fresh as it was upon my first viewing. While I could probably write a dissertation on ""Ghostbusters""' impact on cinema and popular culture, I think I'll conclude by saying this is an entertainment everyone should be exposed to at least once. If you don't like it...well, that's your loss.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Another famous classic comedy!,"Starring: Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Sigourney Weaver, Enrie Hudson, Rick Moranis and Harold RamisRated PGStar Rating: **** out of 5Genre: Action/Comedy/Sci-Fi/Fantasy/MysteryGhost Busters is one of my favorite Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd movies! Ghost Busters is a funny comedy about three guys named Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), and Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) who are scientists at Columbia University, college located in New York City. When their grant expires, the trio gets fired and start up their own business of ghost exterminators called Ghost Busters! Their first customer was Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) who is scared out of her apartment on the 22nd floor of a high rise apartment building on Central Park West. It seems that Dana's neighbor, Louis Tully (Rick Moranis), is also being affected by the strange happenings in the apartment building. Later, The Ghost Buster become wildly popular and later they have Winston Zeddmore (Ernie Hudson) joined the team because he was looking for a job and he was hired! Overzealous Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) agent Walter Peck thinks the Ghostbusters are frauds, and he has the Ghostbusters put in jail. Walter Peck kind of reminds me of Commander Farrell (from Swat Kats) and J. Jonah Jameson (from Spider-Man) because they also think just because the hero they have now isn't protecting the city the way they want them to they want them in jail! Also in this movie we see Slimer and that Giant Pillsbury Dough Boy. Saturday Night Live comedians Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd bring really funny jokes in this movie as well as some of their other movies!

Who ya gonna call?,"If you grew up in the eighties you likely have a soft spot for the 1984 film ""Ghost Busters"". The surprising thing is that, more than 25 years later, it still stands up as a successful melding of comedy and special effects.The story blends science and fantasy in a way that's both believable and entertaining. Meanwhile, keeping the film semi-realistic serves to ground the fantastic events, thus making it easier to suspend belief. The special effects, while far surpassed by today's efforts, nevertheless paint a convincing picture.When it comes to acting, the film excels in that regard. Comedy legends Murray, Aykroyd, Ramis & Moranis all contribute fine performances, often underplaying the humour to excellent effect. Sigourney Weaver adds a welcome distaff element, as does memorable supporting player Annie Potts. Also among the support, Ernie Hudson & William Atherton prove to have been well cast.The direction by Ivan Reitman is well done, if not particularly outstanding. That being said, he should be commended for coaxing authentic performances of out his actors in an effects-heavy film like this. Speaking of the effects, they were the source of one of the film's two Oscar nominations; the other being Ray Parker Jr.'s classic theme.All in all, ""Ghost Busters"" is a well-crafted comedy that deserves to be remembered for years to come. The sequel may have been somewhat underwhelming but the original, with its deadpan humour and iconic visuals, is truly deserving of the designation ""classic"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Is there a more quotable movie?,"One of the best comedies of the '80s. Bill Murray and Harold Ramis know how to do it. They've collaborated together on numerous projects (Stripes, Groundhog Day, for example) but this is the best of them all.This would have been an even better movie if there wasn't a sequel, but that's just Hollywood wanting to cash in. Who are we kidding? Murray, Aykroyd, Ramis, and Reitman wanted to cash in, too. (Although, ""Oscar? Oh, my mommy named me after a hotdog"" was a great line from GB II.)It's such a great movie that Annie Potts didn't even bug me. That is a miracle alone.

A 5 star great story,"Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray and Harold Ramis might not be perfect in this movie, but that was most likely their biggest hit. And if you know better any of other works from those 3 guys, you'll know what I'm talking about.They are 3 little genius, one in each aspect of making movies, and the collided together in this one. It couldn't have resulted in anything better, it was just perfect, for the time.I'm not gonna talk about the story, there's enough reviews and knowledge over this big hit. Instead, I want to talk about intertextuality.The movie was made in 1984, same year of some movies I've watched, such as Terry Gilliam's Brazil, Starman, Amadeus, Karate Kid, The Garden of Eden, Indiana Jones in the Temple of Doom, Dune... And so many others I wish I had seem... It was a hard competition for prizes, I guess that's the reason why it didn't get so many awards.Hell, not even former Monty Python's award winning from 12 monkeys Terry Gilliam could win something with his movie, mostly because of poor production (not his fault, at all).Anyway, this movie has so many deep inner meanings, every time I watch it again it gets me surprised with something I haven't seem before. And I have seem a lot.Later works from Harold Ramis are my favorite. Every one of them. I think my favorite would be Bedazzled (2000) and, please, don't overlook this amazing movie. It was first written by Peter Cook and shot in movie on 1967 by the same Peter, yes the same Peter who inspired Monty Python and probably most of Terry Gilliam's works.But I can't get enough of all of Harold R. like Analyze this and that, he only gets better and better in time, maybe going too far and then heading back to earth, hehe. To me, he resembles a lot Calvin & Hobbes (a.k.a Harold) for some reason... I just miss few of his works, like Cadyshack and maybe Stripes.He also makes appearances like in Orange County or As Good As It Gets. Always playing a really good and smart person, just like in Ghostbusters, but always different sides of himself.And now he is doing a new work with the also amazing, although weird, Owen Wilson. I think he was best seem with Jackie Chan in Shangai Noon.Anyway, this first Ghostbuster is amazing, a great story and at least 5 star merit. Worth way more than watching it just once. 5 times might not be enough to fully understand it, and I keep hoping I've had enough at same time I keep getting really good surprises when I watch it again, over time.Hard to decide the vote between 9 and 10, but since the score right now is 7, I made my mind for a 10+. :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Saturday morning (almost noon) fun.,"In the 1960s Saturday morning was known as cartoon day. By the mid 1970s a few shows had been aired that included real people. These included H.R. Huf'n'Stuf, the Far Out Space Nuts, the Banana Splits, the Bugaloos, and last but not least, the Ghostbusters. There was even a show featuring trained chimps called Lancelink, Secret Agent Chimp. Ghostbusters was a conglomeration of static and repeated sets and scenery, schticks, slapstick, and ultimate ghost-ridding conclusions. Ghostbusters was a pro-nonsense, no worries or cares kind of show. Repeated aspects of the show include Tracey's attempts at painting, Spencer's attempts at opening the file drawer, Tracey driving to get their assignments, the assignments self-destructing in Tracey's face as he follows the countdown, the same castle drawing that was pictured for where all the ghosts seemed to reside, and Tracey's prop gags before the Ghostbusters entered the castle.

The humor that results from these differences works perfectly.  No character is the same.Ghostbusters probably has the most cohesive cast of any movie I've ever seen, their chemistry pulls you into the movie.I see no reason why anyone should dislike this film, it moves smoothly and doesn't drag, the humor is placed perfectly throughout the film and the timing is perfect.

THE GREATEST MOVIE ALIVE,"This movie has been my favorite since I was young. I have recently bought the 15th Anniversary Edition of Ghostbusters, which I might add makes me angry in several ways. 1) I don't like how the camera moves around the screen, when one person is cut out. 2)Where is the added scenes? I bought the video to see the added scenes, and there none. I have the original movie, and I bought the 15th Anniversary to see new scenes, and there were none, it was the same. When I was young, my friends and I dressed up with our toy Proton Packs and watched the movie while acting it out. We knew the lines off by heart, and I still know them. I have never seen New York. I have planned twice to go there, but they have canceled each time. I have always dreamed of going there since I first saw Ghostbusters. But it can wait because no matter how many times I have seen Ghostbusters, it never gets boring. I love this movie because of New York, I love how Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis wrote the story, it was amazing! Now, I always wondered why Ivan Reitman never made Ghostbusters 3. There was some talk of it, but I think it was only a rumor. As for Ghostbusters 2, part 1 was WAY better.Thank you for letting me get this out of me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
They're coming to save the world!,"I've memorized large portions of Ghostbusters dialogue from watching it so much. I love this movie and have pretty much had it on play for the last 15 years. Why do I love it so much? Well, first of all there hasn't been many good pairings like the Ghostbusters. Now Ernie Hudson was never really part of the group in this movie, in the second one he was more integrated into the fold. Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, and Harold Ramis are a brilliant comedic pairing. The chemistry between these 3 characters is warm and funny. The special effects are good for the time and contribute to the film rather than make up the majority of it like so many films today. Bill Murray especially laces his dialogue with wisecracks and this is one of his best roles. This movie is a classic and I think they should be making a third. Bottom Line: Ghostbusters inspires a cult like few movies. This kind of success is deserved only by the best movies with wide ranging appeal. Ghostbusters is one of these films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
It's all about Mr. Murray.,"After watching The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou earlier this week, it made me long for the days when filmmakers knew what made their actors great and how to utilize their talents properly. Ghostbusters is not only a fine film, but perhaps the best showcase ever made for Bill Murray's genius.Who knows how good John Belushi (whom the part of Dr. Peter Venkman was originally written for) would have been in this film. I'd certainly trade Murray's performance for Belushi's life if it were possible. But since that won't happen all we can do is sit back and enjoy Murray's excellent performance. Here are some of the highlights.The guys are interviewing a frightened old librarian who has just seen a ghost. The woman is absolutely petrified as she is trying to describe what she has seen, as well as answer some questions about herself. Murray at one point in the interview asks the old woman if she is currently menstruating. Her supervisor understandably objects, seeing no logical connection. Murray simply tells him, ""Back off, man. I'm a scientist."" We as the audience aren't quite sure why he asked the question. We can only sit back and chuckle at him putting an already terrified woman on the spot.The scene in which Murray accompanies Sigourney Weaver back to her apartment to check out her initial disturbance is vintage Murray. You get the sense that whether or not his character believes in ghosts is irrelevant. He certainly isn't frightened of them, but he has to at least try to act concerned so this woman might possibly take him seriously as a scientist. He makes a bold point to be the first of them to enter the apartment. He then starts fingering the two highest keys on her piano. ""They hate this. I like to torture them,"" he explains. After some macho posturing, he takes out an obscure device that looks like a combination of a blood pressure cuff and a car battery. He begins squeezing the device, resulting in a swooshing sound. There is a great sense that not only are we the audience baffled as to what the device is for, but Murray himself likely does not know. ""Excuse me, but what is that thing you're doing?"" Weaver asks. ""It's technical. One of our little toys,"" he tries to explain. Later on, they venture into her kitchen where she had some trouble with her groceries earlier. Murray walks over to the counter where there are fried eggs splattered all over it. ""Dana... are these the eggs?"" he asks, trying to sound like he truly thinks they might NOT be the eggs she described to them earlier. It is a testament to her professionalism that Ms. Weaver or anyone else for that matter could get through this scene without dying of laughter.The film is also filled with one-liners, great special effects, and some creepy monsters. This is one of the better comedies to come out of the 1980s. And I think we have Bill Murray to thank for most of it.10 of 10 stars.The Hound.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
slime me again,"I loved this film. Its just magical and it works better than its slapstick template. One of the best comedies of the 80's which had a huge promotional campaign of a poster with the traffic no entry sign with a ghost on it. With no accompanying explanation this 'by its repetition it aroused curiosity and irritation in the public to demand what this advertising was for, so achieving the advertisers intention""  Rachel Gordon, Stephen Armourae,. Ghostbusters Groundbreaking comedy of the 80's in many ways since it took Abbot and Costello's slapstick films using horror characters and presented to a new audience with 3 decades of Hollywood change in style and technology. Hollywood realised that their business surged in the summer months from a teenage market. The 2 popular genres were crazy comedies and scary films with CGI. The answer was to mix the 2. Ghostbuster's stands out from other comedies by delivering satire on contemporary society and parodies TV advertising and dating rituals. The problem with the film is that Ernie Hudson as the black member was never treated as an equal member of the team in the script. Life has come to imitate art: the British actor and writer Stephen Armourae is training as a scientist like the Spengler character and is more like Murray than he would admit. And he's a parapsychology researcher like all of them. Its strength is the ensemble performances centred on Murray and Ackroyd who showed they were at the best in a team.

who you gonna call,"With lines that you can quote on a daily basis, and a theme song that just sticks to your head, the Ghostbusters is a movie to watch. The line ""Who You Gonna Call?"" is well used in real life and even in the movie world as a tribute to the theme music. Ghostbusters is a film that has been tagged as one of the best comedies of 1984, the movie used a lot of special effects to pass it's message across, and the powerful acting of Bill Murray (Peter) made this movie an infectious plague that as soon as you pass by while it is running on TV you just take a sit to see it again.The film was followed by a sequel, Ghostbusters II in 1989 and the movie franchise grew to include two animated television series one named The Real Ghostbusters show casing more adventures of the original four and Extreme Ghostbusters about a new team of busters mentored by Egon.Written by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis the movie is about three eccentric parapsychologists in New York City, who start a ghost catching business. The movie original idea which was written by Aykroyd was a little too bogus and out of this world to have worked, as it features a group of Ghostbusters travelling through time and going to other dimensions fighting ghost. They group used wands instead of proton packs to fight the ghosts.When the story was pitched to the director and producer of this 1984 classic, Ivan Reitman, Reitman bought the idea but felt the script was just off, so Harold Ramis came on board and he and Aykroyd worked on the script for a three week period, making it more realistic and more tuned down.The Characters for the movie were meant to be played by Belushi, Eddie Murphy, and John Candy. But Belushi died during the writing of the screenplay and Murphy and Candy didn't want the roles, so Ayrkroyd and Ramis re-wrote the characters took the roles themselves and brought Bill Murray on board, an addition which was well received.The movie plot is about three unemployed parapsychology scientist who got fired from their jobs in the university for their weird behaviour and intrigue by the paranormal. The trio Dr Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Dr Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) and Dr Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) decided to rent an old firehouse to set shop and started trapping ghost, spirits and poltergeist for money. They decided to hire an extra help and got Winston Zeddmore (Ernie Hudson) in on the ghost busting business.But things took a change for the worse when they stumbled upon a gateway into another dimension and an evil waiting to break free into this world, the group now have to go save the world from this impending disaster.The Ghostbusters is a classic comedy/Sci Fi movie that all should watch and own, the movie has so much details and fun that you find yourself captivated by the whole idea of Ghost busting.

Bill Murray, one of the funniest men alive, delivers one of his funniest performances. His serious, stylish, and absurdly-uptight attitude in this movie is funny as heck. Dan Akroyd is funny as well! Harold Ramis is hilarious! He is so serious with his job. He treats everything he does with such precise attention and importance. Like when the girl asks him what hobbies he has. Just the way he gives his response is hilarious. His character is great. These three actors have such good attitudes that their performances in this film came out top notch.

Fine fantasy that depicts the supernatural brilliantly,"After getting kicked out of University three scientists get their own place and create an organization fighting supernatural phenomenon.Ivan Reitman's 1984 smash does little wrong with a suave portrayal of the supernatural in what must be the most recognized fantasy comedy of the last 30 years.Almost every living thing (human or none human) could pick up the classic Ray Parker Jr tune without too much trouble recalling the lyrics and quite possibly the dance moves But though this picture is enthralling, sublimely musical and justification of an all too familiar genre, it is Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd who make this picture what it is, which is simply unique at its own accord and stomps all over rival attempts at fantasy comedy.Fantasy comedies are perhaps one of the hardest genres to tackle as diving into a supernatural world is one thing but making the context of what appears on screen is another. Pixar films tackle these with ease such as Oscar winning Wall-E or other alien hit smash Men in Black. But then they can fail spectacularly like parody Disaster Movie or ordinary glossed with fantasy My Super ex-girlfriend.Ghostbusters takes the concept of ghosts and puts a marvellously humorous entertaining spin on with some flashing representations of ghosts. The green slime monster is one of the finest touches of this film, though only on screen for minimal time he makes an impact with the sheer grotesque nature and rebellious attitude. The formation likewise is striking and instantly memorable. However what steels the limelight for the film is the rather weird but undeniably inclusion of the film's final monster, a towering icon that brings fear and quiet humour to a devastating and riveting climax Bill Murray brings that wonderful wit to his character Peter Venkman here, using his talented timing and smart deadpan expressions to win over the audience. Aykroyd also brings that zany element to his Doctor as well, and Weaver rounds it off nicely with a temptress that will please any older male viewer. Dana's hard to get nature is wonderfully comic but insanely romantic also.The plot can occasionally wave with some loopholes in the context of the finale and the fact that the events seem limited in a small space may raise eyebrows. But the humour and sheer brilliance of the encoded fantasy will delight viewers of any age and with comic legends Murray and Aykroyd you can't do much better in a fantasy comedy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Bustin' (still) makes me feel good,"Ghostbusters was fabulous when I saw it aged 12 and 15 years on it's even better.  As a kid caught up in the (well deserved) hype, I had little interest in the dialogue and subtle spontaneous comic asides.  I was wrapped in the effects, which , stop motion aside, actually still stand up pretty well today.However, coming back to the movie on DVD after all these years I can now see the film 'whole' as it were, and it's only now do I realise just how good it is.  The special FX aren't really whats important here.  The story is highly original, has a lovely pace, and strikes a clever balance between comedy and terror.  There are some spooky moments in this film, but they never push it too far, and they are always followed by a laugh.  The film is nicely scripted but the delivery also has a nice spontaneous feel to it, perhaps not surprising considering we've got three good comedy actors and writers centre stage.In fact all players in the film are fantastic, the three leads look like they've spent their whole life together, Sigourney becomes a bit of a hell-raiser, and Rick Moranis barely pauses for breath during his hilarious verbal diarrhoea as uber-nerd Louis.  Also, let us not forget another truly odious character from William Atherton, as the over-zealous officer from the EPA.  In a way, it's a shame Winston (Ernie Hudson) couldn't have been given a bit more to do or a few extra gags - but then maybe that would have been too much, and his character works well representing all us 'normal' people.Ghostbusters is so much fun, and so brilliantly crafted it actually makes me despair for the kids of the 90's as they've had so little to compare to this.  Only Men In Black and the Pixar releases have come close.  Come on Hollywood - start making some original fun films again!Oh, and special mention must go to the wonderfully spooky music by Elmer Bernstein, which is often overlooked (overheard?) due to the famous Ray Parker Jr. theme tune.In summary:great for kids + great for grown ups = superb for grown up kids.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
80s Fusion,"Ghostbusters is a trivial film in both structure and style.  It certainly isn't well edited due to many gaps in the timeline, but there are several redeeming qualities to it.  For starters, the casting is terrific.  While the scripted characters themselves are paper-thin, the writers (Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd) fill them with enough interesting dialogue to make things more memorable.  Ramis in particular is ingenius as Spengler. Unfortunately, his ability and character were wasted in the sequel.The film presents an interesting mix.  There is the prototypical horror hook of such films as The Exorcist and The Haunting, but it combines it with the 80s notion of ""technology can solve or do anything"", evident with WarGames and Blade Runner.  Of course, Ghostbusters isn't anywhere near the level of Blade Runner, and it's all for laughs.  Nonetheless, the comedy element strikes deeper than garbage like Dumb & Dumber.  While Ghostbusters doesn't have a purpose, it certainly is trying to find it.  Interesting in a decade that shunned intelligent thinking.On the side note, I feel this movie was robbed at the Oscars both for Visual Effects and Song.  Ray Parker, Jr. isn't the 80s' greatest, but the song certainly contributed to the success of the movie.  Also, the sound editors deserve their fair share of credit in creating the interesting noises of both the ghosts and the unique ""firepower"" the team wields against them.Overall, a film that has aged, but not as bad as other ones from this decade.  Essential viewing for children of this decade and comedy buffs, but more introspective reviewers who like Woody Allen should avoid it.  3 out of 5 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
A real ghost!,"As we wait for Ghostbusters to do better next summer let's not forget the original from 1984 that made lots of parodies, memes and on. Now go for Ghostbusters location hunt in NYC",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
An all-time comedy classic.,"Anyone who seriously thinks this film is worth less than eight stars needs their head checking.  This is an absolute - although not perfect - classic. Ghostbusters has to be up their with the great comedy films.  Okay, so the plotline is more than a little bizarre, and maybe the effects are extremely dated, but this was made in 1984 - and is still one of the only films that has truly made me laugh.  And that's a hard thing to do! 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Classic 80s movie,"When I think of 80s comedy this is what comes to mind. This is an extremely dumb fun movie. The script is not that good but you don't go to a Ghostbusters movie to see a good story laid out you go to watch scientists catch ghosts. And that's the charm of this movie. It was very much an underdog in the time it relased and to see it become such a big franchise is really cool. The actors are one of the things that make this such a fun watch. It isn't ground breaking performances by any of them but they fit the vibe of the movie so well that you just have to love them. One thing that I'm not the biggest fan of in this movie is there is no place where it is serious. It's a really dumb movie and that's good for it, but it needs some points where it is serious. And i believe this movie is lacking that. Other than that this is a solid film if you are looking for vibes alone."" It's the staypuft marshmallow man!""Farewell.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
All Time Favourite Movie,"I can honestly say that Ghostbusters has been my favourite movie since I first saw it. The first time I saw this movie I was only five years old. Now I know that this is not old enough to understand many, if not all, of the ""big"" scientific words in the movie, or all of the sexual innuendo but that is what is so great about this movie, age was never in the way of enjoying this movie.This movie contains many scenes for younger people to enjoy and classic lines such as ""back off man, Im a scientist."" and ""it slimed me."" And who could ever forget the one hundred foot Marshmellow man.I have seen Ghostbusters, and Ghostbusters II well over 100 and 50 times each (it is sad I know) and have bought them at least 3 or 4 times each (once again, very sad) and have now ""subjected"" my girlfriend to them (she likes Part II better, blasphemy). While they are not the greatest movies of all time (Godfather Part II) they are enjoyable movies that have, comedically, visually and creatively, stood the test of time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Untouched.,"This film is one of the first I can ever remember seeing, and as a child I loved everything ""Ghostbusters"". It's because of this film that I love Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis and everything that they do. To me, they are the Ghostbusters, and always will be. And why is that? Because this film is magical. Everything about this film works. The casting, the locations, the music used through out and of course the famous title theme. It's a film for children, it's a film for adults, it's a comedy (but it is acted completely straight as though it's real)it's a ""supernatural spectacular"". It's also iconic. Everybody knows the logo and the theme its transcended the movies and is a part of pop culture. It's untouched even to this day, and it deserves no less than 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
