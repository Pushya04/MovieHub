The zenith of the MCU franchise.,"I feel like I'm wasting my time writing down my thoughts about Avengers: Endgame, because nothing I (or any critic) could say about it would ever dissuade a prospective viewer from seeing it. But after having had the chance to watch it at a preview screening, I can't help but say a few spoiler-free words.I'm not your average fanboy -- most long-running franchises have bored me at this point, and I couldn't care less about the newest Star Wars episode or whether there will be another film set in the Harry Potter universe.But Marvel films have been consistently watchable, with many solid entries and a few great ones (Winter Soldier, Ragnarok, the first Guardians of the Galaxy among others). And after Infinity War ended with a cliffhanger, I was looking forward to the conclusion. Boy, was I not disappointed!Very few highly-anticipated movies live up to the hype, but Avengers: Endgame is one of them. It's the perfect follow up to Infinity War, and the absolute zenith of the Marvel franchise. It's hard to see how they'll be able to top this one.It's surprisingly inventive (even when you know where the story is headed, the plot takes a few tangents getting there), emotionally engaging (a few people were crying in the theater) and surprisingly funny (this is probably the most I've laughed in a Marvel film since Thor: Ragnarok). Visually speaking, it's a true spectacle (topping Infinity War in the 'epic battle' stakes), and even though it's three hours long, it doesn't feel bloated. The only times I glanced at my watch was because I was hoping there would be more time before the end.Yes, it's a superhero movie, but an immensely entertaining one (especially for fans who have seen all the pictures that came before it: there are tons of references and inside jokes to reward the faithful).If ""Return of the King"" managed to win Best picture at the 2003 Oscars Avengers: Endgame deserves at least a nomination. It's as good (and in many ways better) a conclusion to a fantasy/genre series as the Peter Jackson film,.Go see it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Crazy in every sense,"This film is an emotional rollercoaster with some of the coolest superhero plot lines ever drawn up. It's straight up the most epic Marvel film that will probably ever be created. I don't see how Marvel could ever top this, but getting to see these characters all together at least one last time was a reward all on its own.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
They had no right to do that,"First review from me. This film deserves it. A superhero film, marvel or not, does not have the right to send me on the emotional rollercoaster that End Game did. It has no right to do what it did, paying tribute to 10 years of films whilst changing the rules as to what a superhero film should be.I laughed, lots.
I cried, lots.
I cheered (quietly and internally of course), lots
I even punched the air in a ""go on!"" during one sceneI can honestly say, no film has ever moved me like that. Hours later, my heart was still pounding, the adrenaline still flowing from this epic piece of film making.Made by fans, for fans. Are there flaws? Yes. If you over think the story of course there is. But it works. It flows. It fits.Go with it. Enjoy the ride.Soak up every second, it doesn't feel like 3 hours, it feels like a flow of story reaching a conclusion that will shock and move you.I have nothing else to say.10/10.

The ending made all 22 movies worth it,"If you're going to watch this movie, avoid any spoilers, even spoiler free reviews.
Which is why I'm not going to say anything about the movie. Not even my opinion. All I'm going to say is:The crowd applauded 3 times during the movie, and stood up to clap their hands after. This I have never witnessed in a Dutch cinema. Dutch crowds aren't usually passionate about this. I checked the row where I was sitting, and people were crying. After the movie, I was seeing people with smudged mascara. That's all I have to say about the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The End of an Era!,"After Avengers Infinity War, we waited for the Avengers Endgame. We wondered how the story would go on, how our heroes would turn back, what would be the end of Thanos. Many theories related to this have been put forward. Avengers Endgame was undoubtedly the most anticipated film of recent years. Normally, the higher the expectation, the higher the probability of disappointment. But this is not the case for Endgame. Whatever you're expecting, you find much more in the film. This means that the biggest concern about the film has disappeared.On the other hand, another comparison comes up. Is Endgame more successful than Infinity War? We can comfortably say it Avengers Infinity War is just the beginning of the story. Endgame was the finale of the story. So we shouldn't think of these two films as two separate stories. There is only one story divided into two parts.Avengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team. Everyone's concern was that Captain Marvel, who was included in the Marvel world, overshadowed other heroes. We can say that this certainly did not happen. What is important in this struggle is not how strong you are, but how good you are. This comes to the fore in all areas. It gives good message about being a hero and a family.Of course, Avengers Endgame has some critical aspects. For example, is the three-hour period necessary in terms of the story? It can be discussed. The head of the story moves much slower than the rest. It also drags the heroes into an emotional predicament. Then the tempo is rising and the heavy scenes we are watching are getting more meaningful. The last 45 minutes of the movie is fully action packed. But the last 45 minutes goes so fast that you don't even realize it. Action and battle scenes are really successful. There is not even a slight distress about visual effects. There are also slight logic errors in the film, but in general the story is so successful that these details become meaningless and insignificant after a certain point.Lastly, Avengers Endgame doesn't have a movie end scene. Because after the film's final, there is no need for another scene. The Marvel legend Stan Lee appears with a small stage. But this is the last surprise scene in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Moreover, there is no clue about Marvel's future. This makes us wonder more about Spider-Man: Far from Home. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
So much potential lost ....,"After Infinity War I had huge expectations. Unfortunately I think it doesn't follow the comic book at all because they wanted some kind of closure of the story.
I saw a lot of 10 star reviews and I cannot believe the majority of people like this movie more than Infinity War.
I'm not saying it wasn't entertainment to watch but the feeling is that all heroes were forced to fit in a movie paying a big price to the story.
There are moments in the movie where the rules from all other Marvel movies are broken and characters which were build over hours of screen time were reduced in order to make space for others.
The story is average at best with big flaws.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

A little bit underwhelmed,"Don't get me wrong, the movie was great, but would I watch it a second time? Probably not - until the DVD comes out.I've seen infinity war at least 5 times, and it's one of my favorite films.That being said, i will compare the two movies for sure, and I just disliked the pacing, it was all over the place. Some Characters felt off, and some got little to no screen time, where others had too much.It's just too many characters for one movie, even though infinity war did it much better, with just as many characters. I just can't put my finger on it.The fighting scenes were alright, the first half lacked action, but the second half delivered some good solid scenes, nothing groundbreaking, but fun to watch. They can't reinvent the wheel, neither do they want to. They stick to what works, and that's alright.All in all, the movie was a close 8/10, the fanboys who give it a 10 are just blind to accept the mistakes the movie made. It's not a perfect film, even an 8 is really generous in my opinion. The Movie works with nostalgia and gives fans of the MCU the things they wanted, more or less.Still thinking Thor 3 was the best MCU movie. Sue me.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Just so disappointed!,"I expected so much from this film but just feel so disappointed by it. A poor and incoherent story with so many contradictions within it plus a total waste of my favourite character - amongst others (like Thanos himself). I did go and rewatch it in the cinema a second time and realised that, without all the excitement and expectation I went in with the first time I was just really really bored.It did have some nice ""moments"", especially the anticipated big fight towards the end. Some characters get a good inning - love Antman and, of course, Iron Man but this is my least favourite MCU film.And the ending...........sigh!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

No Justice for this Film,"I loved how the story of the Infinity War was conceived. With all the fight scenes and the emotional aspect of the movie, especially the end part, everything was superb. But this is supposed to be a wrap-up film. The directors and writers just destroyed it all. What's the point of doing a hype over Captain Marvel for this movie when you just give her a few minutes of screen time? It would be forgiven if you give her an amazing fight with the villain during the climax. But what have you done? With just a few kicks and punches and that's it. It doesn't give a scratch over Thano's face. What a crap!!!You also ruin Hulk! He is supposed to be the strongest Avenger after the events of Infinity War, after all the disappointment and frustration he has experienced when Hulk won't face Thanos. But this time, he's just as good as nothing Avenger. I wonder why they did not give Thanos and Hulk a fight of a lifetime. I'm really surprised that they did not even get face-to-face when all hell breaks loose.This movie is dubbed as an action movie but got 75% of the time talking and mumbling.There's no justice at all to those beloved characters and this movie. You have ruined my expectations.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Very disappointing,"Right in the beginning, you know how the movie is going to end...the good guys are going to win. How anti-climactic that was.. The stage is not set right (half of all humanity is gone, but the enormity of that is not explored...)...when you have Thanos give his explanation as to why he did what he did, I found myself thinking - well, he actually has a point.
In the meanwhile, every single superhero is given time to fight, say some cute things, some say a few smart things, a few even manage to say profoundly philosophical statements...
The quantum physics explanations used to explain how things are done, are plainly non sense... ..they just made stuff up as they went on.

The Perfect Finale,"Avengers: Endgame is the final film to the Infinity saga in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story is emotional, unpredictable, unforgettable, complex and intense. The story does continue on right after infinity war had finsihed, and I thought it was a good way too start because the characters can give you an understanding of how they are feeling. How much loss they have witnessed.
During the three hour film, you care so much for the characters that it makes you want them to live through the whole time, leaving with no casualties. The acting by the cast is outstanding, none of their lines sounded cheesy. Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr especially. The audience has never seen the two characters shine so bright and powerful over the last 11 years. The visuals are the most impressive, it is shown to be Oscar worthy and you would be hungry for more as the film continues on. The final battle was the bomb, the mother of all battles, better then Ready Player One's finale. It's so big and all of it fits in perfectly. Avengers Endgame is the perfect finale that has been set up over the last 11 years. Its a rewatchable film and you will never see the characters the same way as you have seen them from the past films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"""I love you 3000.""","FILM: 8.5
Rewatching Avengers: Endgame, I'm struck by how well the Russo Brothers pull off the enormous task of giving each character their due. This film had a lot riding on it, and I still find it incredibly well-made, immensely enjoyable, and ultimately satisfying. The drama is especially well done here-Marvel finally nails it after a string of more digestible, lighter stories. The weight of the stakes is felt throughout, and it's a welcome change.The drama is where this film really shines for me. After several years of Marvel playing it safe with more easily digestible stories, Endgame takes a much-needed dive into heavier emotional territory. It's clear that Marvel finally got it right, delivering drama that feels earned and impactful. Downey Jr, Evans, and Renner are the standout beneficiaries of this approach, with the film both opening and closing with some of their best moments. Their performances anchor the story, making it feel grounded even amidst all the superhero spectacle.The action is, as expected, top-notch, but what surprises me is the level of violence-there's a bit more edge here than I'm used to seeing in a Marvel film. It's refreshing to see some real variation and consequence in the battles, something Marvel has tried to smooth over a bit too much in the past. Watching these characters face real stakes is immensely rewarding, and it adds a layer of intensity that makes the film all the more compelling.Comedy still has its place in Endgame, providing much-needed relief from the drama-heavy narrative. Thor and Rocket handle most of the humour, and while I enjoy their banter, I do feel that Thor's storyline pushes the comedy a bit too far. It sometimes feels like it's making light of what should be serious moments, which can be a bit jarring.After 11 years, Marvel truly delivered a fitting end to this saga. Seeing how successful it was, and how the franchise has failed to reach similar heights over the past five years, is a testament to just how well they wrapped things up.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 9.0

A near perfect end,"This films quality depends on how you watched it and who you are. If you watched most of the MCU up to this point like I did then this will be a revolutionary endgame that redefines all of film culture. Otherwise it seems rather bad and underwhelming. The film has a forward moving plot, great acting and some CGI actually worth looking at. This film didn't become the highest grossing movie of all time for no reason. It does have some obvious flaws tropes and plot holes but other than that acts as a brilliant finale to the infinity saga. Now don't watch the multiverse saga. It willn't ruin your opinion but they aren't good sequels either. All in all a film worth watching if you have watched the entire MCU up to that point, otherwise an okay film.

Whatever it takes...,"Hello again everyone! It's been almost a month since thousands of Marvel fans (including myself) got to see the one and only Endgame for the very first time, without having a clue of what could possibly happen. And as with most of the people who already watched it...there are no words to describe how this amazingly crafted piece of superhero movie-making just...blew me away.I will start by giving its credit to the acting work of everyone. When we appreciate that, we can see that this isn't just another sci-fi flick where no one does exactly a great effort to make a remarkable performance. No. This is a movie that presents us a group of heroes that, after long years of saving the earth from any menace, are giving the last of themselves in order to give the planet one last shot. The performances made it all seem authentic and real.Now, the story. God. The story is many things. Sometimes it's funny, as any other of the previous movies from the MCU. But also it's deep, melancholic, tragic, and most of all, undeniably exciting.10/10. Probably most of the people that will read this had already watched it.

"The End of a Saga, and the Beginning for Another","Avengers: Endgame is quite possibly the most hyped up movie of all time. The excitement surrounding this films release is a dream come true for Marvel Studios and Disney. With that being said, I have looked forward to this film since it was called Infinity War Part 2 back in 2015 or so. I really enjoyed my time watching this and it marked the end of an era. I finally realized a couple years ago how much the MCU means to me and how much these characters mean to me that I gladly would accept anything this movie did.The CGI was good, but the green screen showed a little bit (meaning the backgrounds looked fake sometimes), the performances from Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans were great because they treated this movie seriously, the cameos in here felt welcomed and the amount of locations in this movie really make it feel like the Avengers are desperate to go anywhere and do anything to save their fallen friends.

On one hand, the film is an epic, three-hour-long spectacle that offers a rollercoaster of emotions-grief, hope, nostalgia, and triumph. The final battle scene, where all the heroes unite against Thanos, is a jaw-dropping, cheer-inducing moment that's destined to be iconic. The visual effects are top-notch, and the action sequences are choreographed with meticulous precision.On the other hand, the movie's scale can make it feel bloated and unwieldy. With so many characters and storylines to juggle, not all of them get the attention they deserve. Some heroes, like Captain Marvel, are underutilized, while others, like Thor, receive arcs that are divisive among fans. Thor's transformation into a depressed, beer-guzzling shadow of his former self is played for laughs but also feels like a disservice to his character development in previous films.The time-travel plot is another area where Endgame falters. While it allows for some fantastic callbacks to earlier films and provides a clever way to undo the events of Infinity War, it also introduces a host of logical inconsistencies. The film's explanation of time travel is murky at best, and the rules seem to change whenever it's convenient for the plot. This lack of clarity can be frustrating, especially for viewers who prefer a more coherent narrative structure.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A Movie That Comes Out Once In A Century,"I don't have words to express my love for this and infinity war!I agree that infinity war was much better than this, but I think some of the ""serious"" or ""boring"" moments in this movie was needed to explore the consequences of The Blip.Anyway, even as a standalone movie, it's too good: A group of superheros go back in time to undo the actions of a mad titan.Moreover, as a movie that is linked to multiple other movies and serves as a conclusion, it's one of the best things that's happened to cinema! It's the best in every aspect. It's emotionally intense and visually rich.It's almost guaranteed that you're gonna get goosebumps in the climax!Infinity War and Endgame are one of the best movies of all time and you can't miss them!I'd highly recommend you to start watching The MCU from Iron Man and you're gonna fall in love with the two movies mentioned above.If you ain't very familiar with MCU, don't watch.

Truly Beautiful,"I just watched the Avengers movies and some of the infinity saga and I truly think this is a great movie, the CGI and acting were wonderful and the ending was truly a masterpiece and was probably the best ending for a movie saga (don't quote me on this). There are some low points but they are they don't effect the true rating which is a ten, this movie deservers the 8.4. Or an 8.5, I kinda have a bias. Cause i grew up with the marvel movies specifically Iron Man and stuff but the bias does not effect my rating. I live it and many others love it as well i regard this the end 0of the entire mcu from Iron Man - No Way Home, the other multiverse movies are mid and are very odd.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
In the list of my top 5 favourite Marvel Movies.,"""Avengers: Endgame"" - A Spectacular Culmination of Marvel's Cinematic UniverseIn the realm of superhero cinema, ""Avengers: Endgame"" stands as an unprecedented achievement. Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, this epic finale to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) represents the culmination of over a decade of storytelling and character development. Clocking in at just over three hours, ""Endgame"" is a sprawling, emotionally charged spectacle that delivers on its promise to provide closure for beloved characters while reshaping the MCU's future.The film begins in the aftermath of ""Avengers: Infinity War,"" with half of all life in the universe obliterated by the malevolent Thanos (Josh Brolin). The surviving Avengers are left reeling, grappling with guilt and loss. The emotional weight of this situation is palpable, setting a somber tone that lingers throughout the movie.One of the film's strengths lies in its character-driven narrative. Each Avenger is given ample screen time to grapple with the consequences of their actions and confront their own vulnerabilities. Robert Downey Jr. Delivers a standout performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man, showcasing his character's evolution from a self-centered genius to a selfless hero. Similarly, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers/Captain America and Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow bring depth and gravitas to their roles.""Endgame"" also skillfully employs humor to offset its darker moments. The banter between characters provides much-needed levity, ensuring the film remains entertaining even during its most emotionally charged sequences. This balance of humor and pathos has been a hallmark of the MCU and is executed with finesse here.One of the film's most impressive feats is its ability to seamlessly weave together multiple storylines and characters. The time-travel aspect of the plot allows the Avengers to revisit key moments from previous films, resulting in a nostalgic and satisfying trip down memory lane for fans. It's a testament to the filmmakers' dedication to honoring the MCU's history while moving the narrative forward.The action sequences in ""Endgame"" are nothing short of spectacular. The climactic battle in the third act is a visual feast, featuring a jaw-dropping array of heroes, powers, and epic showdowns. It's a triumphant moment that pays off years of anticipation and buildup. The Russo brothers' direction, combined with Alan Silvestri's stirring score, elevates these sequences to a cinematic crescendo.As for the film's antagonist, Thanos remains a formidable and complex foe. Brolin's motion-capture performance adds depth to the character, and his motivations, while morally questionable, are presented with a degree of philosophical nuance. Thanos remains one of the MCU's most compelling villains.However, ""Endgame"" is not without its criticisms. Some viewers may find the film's lengthy runtime a bit daunting, and certain plot elements involving time travel could be seen as overly convoluted. Additionally, a few character arcs, while emotionally satisfying, may leave fans divided.In conclusion, ""Avengers: Endgame"" is a monumental achievement in the world of superhero cinema. It successfully pays tribute to the characters and stories that have captivated audiences for years while charting a bold new course for the MCU. With its powerful performances, humor, and breathtaking action sequences, it's a fitting and emotional conclusion to an era of cinematic storytelling. While it may not be without its minor flaws, ""Endgame"" stands as a testament to the enduring appeal of the superhero genre and will likely be remembered as a cinematic milestone for years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Pure torture,"I had to take several breaks, walk the dogs, play videogames and clean the house, while watching this absolutely ridiculous and nonsensical pile of rubbish and now afterwards, I'm asking myself why I put myself through such suffering. To what end. I guess I was hoping there would be one scene or at least one line that put a smile on my face or made me feel anything at all except extreme pain and boredom. There wasn't any of that unfortunately, so I just wasted three hours of my life I could have spent on basically anything else and it would have been more worth while. I can't decide which one was more painful to watch, this or Aquaman? Both equally and utterly disappointing I guess.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"Was promised a chocolate cake, turned out to be cake of manure.","Let's be clear - there was a lot of talking about this film, about how great it will be. Turned out? It was a pretty decent story about time traveling (I honestly like those). I even thought I like it, aside from some little things that don't even worth mentioning. But the ending - oh, let me talk about the ending. It is so horrible that it erased any good impression this movie could've left. I don't have the problem with how it ends, with events presented. I have the problem with how boring, non-aesthetic and amateur it was filmed. I'm furious that funeral scene turned out to be such a cheap vulgarity, such an emptiness that tries to play with viewer's emotions - and, sadly, fails. This is what the character died for? To be honored... With this? Boy, oh boy. I don't know how many people actually like this scene, but I sure do not.
Also - diversity. As a commercial product in the first place, a movie about diverse characters, well, completely non-diversed. Heteronormative, I would say, and in 2019 it is quite anachronistic. Quite obvious, of course, that the company is afraid of possible risks and profit losses - another reason to think about what good such soulless capitalistic approach can give us? From where I stand, nothing good. I don't want to be a consumer, I want to be a viewer that is not treated like a money account. Anyway, I was bitter about it just a little - after all, what can you expect from Marvel and Russos, really? They are not Taika Waititi after all (how honestly great it would be if Taika Waititi filmed all Avengers movies is story for another time), so even queer-coding isn't present. What got me furious is that Russo had the nerves to actually say they included LGBT-representation there. Leaving alone term ""LGBT-representation"" and why I have problems with this phrasing, let's see what we have here. And what we have, fellow viewers who don't enjoy tasteless similarity in their films, is a huge slap on our faces and our egos. This is what we can call a proper representation these days? I doubt it. It's so elusive I even didn't noticed it in the first place, thinking that the man could be talking about any people from his family. So, if I can read a text hermeneutically and headcanon some queer characters in there, does that mean a film has representation in it? Or, more important, does it mean director has the right to be bragging about such representation? Last one - certainly not.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Avengers:Endgame historic performance,"Let's talk about the enormity of this film and what Marvel just accomplished.First, this movie did not disappoint. It is very hard to contemplate a movie that will ever have as much or more anticipation than Endgame. Just think about the build up of this film. From May 2008 to April 2019, Marvel, in 21 films, introduced heroes, villains, plots, side plots, family members, love interests and countless Easter eggs that culminated into this film.Second, in a movie full with 10+ main characters, Marvel did an unbelievable job featuring each one and staying true to the characters we've all fallen in love with. This point could easily be a thesis paper for a doctoral candidate. The development and story arcs of characters, individually and collectively, in the midst of struggle and triumph is nothing short of amazing. The attention to detail and thoughtful craftsmanship is true artwork. One knock fans may have is the forced fandom moments. We have so many beloved characters but these moments comes as certain team-up pairings during the big fight that are great but also forced and stereotypical.Lastly, this movie is beauty in motion. Mainly, the movie looks and sounds wonderful. If there is one knock against the movie, the final fight at points was too dark for some of the characters. Otherwise, the final fight displays exactly what many of the DC movies have failed with, Hero power display. Marvel did such a great job of making you feel every punch, kick, hammer throw but also made you feel like you were in motion with each character (thus why I believe 4D would be very good). The sound editing is very good and the song selections in this movie help the viewers follow the emotional roller-coaster ride everyone believes they are in for.Marvel created near perfection for fans (or a near perfect ending). And the ending of this movie, isn't even technically the finish to Phase 3 of their universe. That would be Spider-man: Homecoming coming soon. Phase 4 and 5 are also already in the works. Everyone that was a part of this movie and the first 3 phases should be applauded, but their work is not yet done because for those with the greatest power comes great responsibility.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Amazing finale,"It's definitely not as strong an impression as it was on first viewing, which makes perfect sense, but I still think the film was extremely successful on multiple levels. One of the better things is that the three-hour film is not boring at any point, it seemed to me to last ""only"" two hours, which is not easy to achieve. I also look at this film as the finale or the last episode of a series you've been watching for years, which on the one hand is actually true. So much has happened before this film, so many characters and events. This film is just the crown of it all, one big rounded whole. It is obvious that the Russo brothers had a plan because it is obvious that they paid attention to details and some smaller moments that real fans will easily recognize. Of course I have some objections that are related to certain characters and some scenes, but given the type of film and how much the film offers, I can just get over it and forget about it.

A Spectacle of Sacrifice and Redemption,"Avengers: Endgame was an experience that transcended mere movie-watching for me; it felt like a grand event, a culmination of over a decade of storytelling that I had been a part of. Walking into the theater, the atmosphere was electric, with fans buzzing with anticipation, some even dressed as their favorite characters. It was clear that this was more than just a film; it was a celebration of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.From the moment the movie began, I was drawn into the emotional weight of the story. The film picks up after the devastating events of Infinity War, and the sense of loss is palpable. I found myself deeply invested in the characters' journeys, particularly the way they grappled with their failures and the passage of time. The writers did a fantastic job of weaving in moments of levity amidst the heavy themes, and I found myself laughing out loud at the clever humor that felt organic rather than forced.The pacing, while a point of contention for some, felt deliberate to me. It allowed for character development and reflection, which I appreciated. Yes, the action ramps up in the latter half, and when it does, it's nothing short of spectacular. The visual effects are breathtaking, and the climactic battle sequences had me on the edge of my seat, cheering and gasping along with the audience.What struck me most was the emotional resonance of the film. There were moments that brought tears to my eyes, not just because of the stakes involved but because of the rich history these characters share. It was a bittersweet farewell to some of my favorite heroes, and I felt a profound sense of nostalgia as they faced their final challenges.As for the length, I was surprised at how quickly the time flew by. I was so engrossed that I hardly noticed the three hours pass. The film is packed with callbacks and references that made me smile, rewarding those who have followed the franchise closely.In the end, Avengers: Endgame is not just a superhero movie; it's a heartfelt tribute to the journey of its characters and the fans who have supported them. I walked out of the theater feeling a mix of satisfaction and melancholy, knowing that this chapter had come to a close. It's a film I would gladly watch again, not just for the action but for the emotional depth it brings to the superhero genre. It's a fitting conclusion to a saga that has meant so much to so many.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Heroes Rise and Time Bends!,"Hello everyone, I'm Mr. C Reviewer, tonight we are discussing the Movie, Avengers: Endgame. I watched it on Disney plus . The Movie first aired April 18 (two days before my birthday) in 2019. It has a runtime of 3 hour and 1 minute. It was rated PG-13. The Movie was directed by Anthony Russo and Joe Russo. It was created by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. The movie was loosely based on the comics by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Some of the characters was created by Joe Simon, Jack Kirby, Steve Englehart, Steve Gan, Bill Mantlo, Keith Giffen, Jim Starlin, Stan Lee, Larry Lieber, Jack Kirby, Steve Englehart and Don HeckSummary: In a desperate bid to reverse the catastrophic events unleashed by Thanos. Following the devastating snap that wiped out half of all life in the universe, the surviving Avengers grapple with their loss and seek a way to restore what was taken from them.Review:-I appreciated the themes explored in the movie, particularly those cantered around sacrifice, friendship, and teamwork. The narrative underscores the significance of collaboration in overcoming challenges, reflecting values that resonate with many individuals. The inspirational messages conveyed-such as resilience in the face of adversity and hope amidst despair-struck a chord with audiences seeking motivation during difficult times in their own lives. I believe that the film's extended runtime caused certain segments to feel prolonged and unevenly paced, which ultimately led to viewer fatigue. This pacing issue detracted from my emotional engagement with pivotal scenes, particularly when contrasted with the high-stakes action sequences. However, I appreciated the pacing that allowed for meaningful character moments while still delivering thrilling action-packed sequences, making the overall experience engaging. Despite its serious themes, the film skilfully balanced humour with emotional depth, providing levity that enhanced rather than diminished its stakes. I appreciated how the incorporation of time travel sparked philosophical inquiries into fate, choice, and consequence. I found the gore in the movie to be visually impressive; some scenes appeared quite realistic. As an autistic individual, I was especially grateful for the inclusion of subtitles, which made it easier to follow the dialogue. I was happy that it told us what was being said when it was in another language.I admired how the film's cinematography skilfully employed a variety of shot types to enhance its storytelling. Wide shots effectively established the scale of epic battles and vast locations like the Avengers compound and outer space, emphasizing the enormity of conflicts. Close-ups captured pivotal character emotions, while medium shots balanced dialogue with surrounding context, creating intimate yet contextual interactions. Over-the-shoulder shots enhanced perspective during conversations, making viewers feel engaged in character dynamics. Tracking Shots followed characters through diverse environments, enhancing action sequences and scene transitions, particularly in chase scenes and complex battlefields. Aerial shots offered dramatic overhead views during large-scale battles, emphasizing chaos and strategic movements. Low-angle shots depicted characters as powerful figures during triumphs and confrontations, instilling a sense of grandeur. While high-angle shots illustrated vulnerability and defeat, especially when characters faced overwhelming challenges.I was impressed by the visual effects, particularly the realism and seamless integration with live-action footage. The portrayal of Thanos utilized advanced motion capture technology, enabling nuanced facial expressions and movements that marked a significant leap in how animated characters convey emotion, making him a compelling antagonist. The film achieved remarkable detail that enriched the overall cinematic experience, with CGI creating a sense of grandeur while maintaining clarity amidst the chaos. I especially appreciated the use of CGI in depicting time travel sequences and alternate realities, which were crucial to the plot's development. Employing cutting-edge techniques such as photorealistic rendering and advanced compositing methods allowed for more lifelike interactions between characters and their environments. Dim lighting was used strategically to emphasize key elements within the frame. I appreciated how the movie provided on-screen text to indicate our current setting and how much time has passed. The soundtrack and sound effects were particularly impactful, as they complemented the scenes beautifully.-I thoroughly enjoyed reconnecting with the characters, and it was gratifying to see them remerge throughout the story. I appreciated how the film revealed what each character had experienced over time and depicted their lives in a meaningful way. The inclusion of strong female superheroes and the depiction of women in powerful roles significantly enriched the narrative. However, I had reservations about a particular character's self-sacrifice, as it risks reinforcing traditional gender roles that suggest women must sacrifice themselves for male heroes. The character development was impressive, showcasing substantial growth and leading to satisfying conclusions for many. Thanos was portrayed as a compelling antagonist; his motivations were explored in greater depth than is typical for villains in superhero films, which enhanced the overall complexity of the story.-I appreciated the film's conclusion; it provided a gratifying resolution. I was pleased that it concluded with a voiceover. Although I felt a touch of sadness at the departure of certain characters, I am eagerly looking forward to the journeys ahead for the remaining characters in upcoming MCU films going forward.I rate each Movie I watch out of 10 and for this one, I give it an 7.9 Remember this was what I thought about the film personally and I suggest that you give it a go for yourself.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

What next for the MCU? Suggestions!,"Loved Endgame but with a lukewarm feeling for The Eternals and Shang Chi on the horizon, I wondered whether the MCU should make more logical choices for the next phase. Obviously there are development issues with the FF and X-Men franchises and DC's Aquaman may well scupper a potential Sub-Mariner movie, but perhaps these would work:1) Captain Britain (we heard 'Braddock' mentioned by Peggy Carter in Endgame; Brian's father perhaps?)
2) Alpha Flight. With the Avengers having run their course, perhaps their Canadian counterparts could step up. It stands to reason that other countries would want to copy the Avengers model (I know they are the Earth's protectors but they pretty much belong to the USA).
3) Moon Knight. Although I would love to see Daredevil done right on the big screen, maybe Marc Spector could fill the void.
4) Silver Surfer. Norrin Radd was the best thing about the FF sequel. A space-based movie would give him room to soar. Look to GotG or the Ron Lim Thanos issues of Silver Surfer for inspiration.
5) Ka-Zar. Although often perceived as a Tarzan rip-off, Lord Kevin Plunder's exploits could open up a whole new playground with the Savage Land.I wonder if we'll look back in 10 years and see if any of these came to pass...!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

An over-gloryfied MCU clip show...,"I'll keep it as short as possible and spoiler free, I didn't expect this movie to be better than Infinity War but it was a disappointment, unfortunately...
The cons first:
a) This movie is almost an MCU clip show. I won't spoil the plot but to me it felt repetitive. Like eating reheated pizza.
b) Too slow. Do you remember the action sequences and the fast pace of Infinity War? Forget that. Literaly there's almost no action for the first one hour and a half!
c) Dispropotional screen time. Unlike infinity War, the majority of superheroes have too little screen time (I'm talking about fighting scenes). Again, I can't spoil anything but some heroes have two or three lines and a ten second action scene.
d) Thanos himself. Unfortunatelly Thanos wasn't as good (or should I say... bad) as he was in Infinity War, he almost feels like a heavy bag with a few lines (and I mean few).
e) Predictable plot (maybe that's only me).
f) The final big battle feels hasty and bad edited. There are too much going on on screen with a very little time for each character.
g) It has a pessimistic and dark tone.
Now the pros:
a) Solid conclusion. The movie is a solid conclusion of MCU's phase 3 (and perhaps MCU itself).
b) Good humor. That's not a surprise for a Marvel movie, there's plenty of tasteful humor and in the correct amount.
c) Good performances. Nothing to add here.
d) No political agendas. I hate it when it happens and thankfully this movie is ok (there are one or two cringeworthy scenes though, but nothing importand).
e) There are some good action scenes and the effects are awesome.
Overall, it felt rushed and it lacks the majestic feeling of Infinity War. I can remember plenty of scenes in Infinity War which gave me goosebumps, unfortunately there's none in Endgame...
Final verdict: 6/10 when I compare it to Infinity War (it's unavoidable), 7/10 as a stand-alone MCU film. In my opinion it's the third best Avengers movie (right below Infinity War and the first one). I didn't regret watching it at the theater, in fact I suggest you to do it, but I won't watch it a second time...",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
An Epic Apex of Comic Book Films,"Just over 5 years ago, the culmination of the first 3 phases of The MCU came to a head with Avengers: Endgame. This was one of the biggest Cinematic events to ever take place and with it hitting its 5 year anniversary, I thought I would give it a rewatch and here is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees the world in turmoil after the events of Avengers: Infinity War, with one last chance to make things right, The Avengers reunite to take on their biggest challenge.Main Character
Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark was the real start of this whole cinematic universe and he is brilliant in this film. He really delivers a strong performance, you see how the events of the previous film really affects him and motivates him to come to terms and once again become Iron man. He still has the funny quips and narcissism that made his character famous which is great.Chris Evans is back as Steve Rogers and similarly he does a great job with this iconic role. He has great chemistry with Downey & Scarlett Johansson and I thought this film did a great job putting him back in the spotlight and having him being an emotional centre of the film.Supporting Characters
Now this might be the largest cast in film history, so I will definitely miss some people out but everybody delivers on their performances and really bring the comic book characters to the cinema screen.Mark Ruffalo reprises his role as Bruce Banner and I actually liked the direction they take his character in this film. They make him a more enjoyable character to watch and it is really good seeing The Hulk getting a bit more time to shine after missing for the majority of the previous film.Scarlett Johansson plays Natasha Romanoff and they really did some really good work with her character of Black Widow. She really struggles with the weight that comes with being one of the leaders of The Avengers who failed and Johansson is strong in her role here.Chris Hemsworth is back as Thor and after the events of Infinity War he is really the character that is effected in a really interesting way. The film handles his failures in a way that I don't think anyone could have expected and it is handled well with Thor developing a lot during the film.After missing Infinity War, Jeremy Renner & Paul Rudd are back as Clint Barton & Scott Lang respectively. The film really focuses on the issues that Barton has gone through since the events of the previous film and it is pretty dark and easy to relate too. Paul Rudd is mostly used for comic relief but is a lot of fun and when he needs to deliver some more dramatic scenes he is good at that too.Don Cheadle gets more screen time as Rhodey and does a good job, Karen Gillan is given her best work yet as Nebula and Thanos played by Josh Brolin is a great villain, though he is clearly not the most important character like he was in Infinity War.Story
The story is great, it really fits the drama and feeling of a world in disarray after what happened in the previous film and the performances delivered on it. Despite having lots of characters and lots of story beats to hit, it really delivers on it and has twists and turns that wouldn't be expected and really drive it up. There is plenty of comic book film fun though and the last act of the film is pure cinema and an experience unlike any other, especially for fans of these films that have been watching since the beginning.Script
This film actually feels a little different to others in the MCU in that it is more serious. It realises the situation that the characters are in and realises it has to be a bit more serious and have these characters have emotional issues and I am glad they went in this direction. The film does have plenty of humour though and these people are naturally funny which does help.Style
The film has great action sequences, there is a lot of green screen and CGI but it looks great throughout and the way they managed to make the film seem really epic is through this. The film is 3 hours long but it really doesn't feel like it, it is paced really well and allows the audience to be invested in the story.Overall
Overall, Avengers: Endgame is one of my favourite films. Being a huge fan of Marvel, this felt like the apex of what could be achieved and the fact that everybody involved nailed it so well made it a truly special event and one that needs to be seen.Rating - 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Amazing, dont blame fans when they say marvel is not marvel after Endgame","""Avengers: Endgame"" soars into the cinematic stratosphere with an 8/10 rating, and I absolutely loved it. The film is a monumental achievement in storytelling and blockbuster filmmaking. The acting from the ensemble cast, including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, and Scarlett Johansson, is top-notch, delivering emotional and powerful performances. The film's editing expertly weaves together multiple storylines and character arcs, making its three-hour runtime feel like a sprint. The strength of ""Endgame"" lies in its ability to deliver a satisfying conclusion to over a decade of storytelling while still introducing thrilling new elements. The weakness? Well, it might be a bit overwhelming for those not well-versed in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The music enhances every epic moment, and the cinematography captures both the grandeur of the battles and the intimacy of the character interactions. Above all, ""Endgame"" carries a profound message about sacrifice, resilience, and the enduring power of hope. This is superhero cinema at its absolute finest.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Nice movie,"This film is an emotional rollercoaster with some of the coolest superhero plot lines ever drawn up. It's straight up the most epic Marvel film that will probably ever be created.

End game without a proper ending,There are so many ways that the movie could have gone. But it is chosen to be this way. So the climax should not be criticised. The story is completed with no proper explanation for the rest of the avengers. Other avengers are not given importance in most of the places. Don't go to the movie if you know the spoilers.

"slighty awkward or boring at times, slow dialog, some cool stuff","Unfortunately clumsy. I enjoyed all previous Avengers, and a few scenes in this are very cool and funny, but this one lowers the bar overall. For me the story petered out instead of maintained momentum from previous movies. The dialogue struggles to be interesting, boring sequences at time.Clumsy Avengers fit awkwardly together for group photo, like bad high school reunion. That said, I enjoy Avengers like everyone else for years, just not this one so much.The super-power woman, Capt Marvel, her powers are overdone. Too simplistic, too much power. No reason for her to lose any fight.Was a big collective of all heroes even necessary? Sort of not really.Some scenes linger way too long, drawing out already thin content. And where was Dr Strange? He hardly had anything to say, and very brief appearance, yet he was in possession of crucial aspect of story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Avengers: Endgame (2019),"The Marvel Cinematic Universe comes to a point where a film feels like an actual event. We have been waiting in anticipation for a year to see the final showdown that started in Infinity War. Actually, scratch that. The entire Infinity Saga started way back with Iron Man. 22 films, countless number of heroes coming together in the culminating battle against Thanos. So much anticipation, ticketing app crashes, and going through so much to try to see this on opening night. Now here we are. Does Avengers: Endgame live up to its high expectations? Absolutely. I felt like it was unique and carries the most emotional weight off anything in this universe but it absolutely serves its fans who have been loyal for years and years.The film takes place three weeks after the end of Infinity War. Half of the worlds population have been wiped out by Thanos and now the remaining Avengers (who just so happen to consist summarily of the original Avengers) must find a way to not only defeat Thanos, but also avenge the fallen and find a way to counteract the actions that occurred at the end of Infinity War. As expected the film stars a gigantic cast of Hollywood's best and watch out for the cameos from heroes who have appeared previously in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.I really would like to talk about this film in a spoiler review but as with every review on my site, there will be no spoilers. I will say that this film has a unique take almost immediately. The humor and banter is still there as it always is and the character arcs are as fantastic as ever at its near completion. The film carries the most emotional weight as anything this universe has seen. The film has so much fan service. I think if you go early on and with a packed crowd of fans you will see just how much this means to the audience who have stayed loyal to this saga.There were laughs, there were cheers, there were gasps, and yes there were tears. The film feels like it should be the very last that the MCU has to offer but of course we know there are Spider-Man and Black Panther sequels coming. The final battle brings just about everything you could hope for. If you're a fan of the series I think you will enjoy this film as it makes a case of being the best Avengers film. It goes hand in hand with Infinity War, of course both films were shot together.Members of the original Avengers put on performances that do their characters the utmost justice after being on this journey for a decade. The film builds up quite slowly but once the plot takes form and the battle lines are drawn it delivers in the way the Russo brothers know how to. Th action is there, and all of what makes the Marvel Universe such a sweeping phenomenon is always there. Some characters could get more screen time, sure. You have to remember that there are so many characters that the film has to juggle and it does that admirably as it is.The film will be a box office hit for sure and will be well reviewed in regards to the Universe as I can already see. I will be seeing this again tomorrow morning and have the same excitement going into a second viewing as I did my first. I found this to be a very special entry and feel like it ties up so much in such a perfect fashion. If you are a fan of superhero fans you need to see this as soon as possible and should do..Whatever it takes.9/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
EXCELSIOR,"The culmination of the infinity saga,this movie is going down in history as one of its kind. MIND-BLOWING MASTERPIECE.Words can't describe the grandiosity of this film. Worth watching more than once.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Not As Good As Infinity War,"But its a pretty good film. A bit of a mess in some parts, lacking the cohesive and effortless feel infinity war somehow managed to accomplish. Some silly plot holes and characters that could've been cut (Ahem, captain marvel and thanos). The use of Captain marvel in this film was just ridiculous. Shes there at the start, bails for some reason? And then pops up at the end to serve no purpose but deux ex machina a space ship...The past thanos part wasn't necessary when you think about it, they could've done this film without a real 'villain' And it would've worked and been a original take on a super hero film without using the same formula we have seen in 10+ super hero films already. The entire final battle felt like a rehashed messy battle, with a bunch more characters against thanos - basically mixing the space battle from infinity war; iron man, spider man etc and the final battle of infinity war with captain america, thor etc.. mashing those two into one within this new film. The scenes of trying to pull the gauntlet off his hand.. it all felt like a rehash.To me the best part of the film was the first act and half of the second, when everyone is lost and trying to figure out how to continue on. Really interesting themes that followed the pay off from infinity wars ending. And then the time heist part. Tho the heist part should've been much more stretched out. With only small parts of thanos within that, and not having him be the big bad again. But just a side character that gets in the way a little bit.And the setting up for 'new avengers' to replace the beloved actors and characters we have come to associate with these films.. they do not get me at all excited for the next phase in marvel films. Falcon, Valkyrie, blackpanther, cap marvel? I just dont care about them at all. And their actors lack any charisma or depth.To me this feels like a closing of marvel films that I'll really enjoy for my pop corn fix. I've given infinity war a 10/10 and some of the stand alone films 8's and 9's. But I have a sinking feeling this will not be happening in the future except the guardians of the galaxy films.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Just not as great as I had hoped.,"A bit like a compilation album, some really great tracks but generally just filler. Cinematically it was epic, spectacular, CGI filled superhero awesomeness but the film was slow to start (after a brilliant emotional first 15 mins) and I was mostly underwhelmed by the plot. I felt Thor was ruined by the joke and some parts were just cameos for the sake of it. I did sob with my son at the saddest part, but I still feel a bit... meh.... maybe I need to watch it again to see if it's better second time around!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Meandering badly pace and mediocre movie,"The first 50 minutes set up the movie very well but the second act lacks urgency and focus. The movie comes to a halt and feels as if it's meandering between scenes, not knowing what to do and not being very entertaining. The movie is also highly predictable and somewhat ruins Thanos's character due to a strange character decision. Iron man is given a lot to work with, which is compelling, same with Hawkeye. The ending is somewhat satisfying but also cringe. Overall it is a fine movie, not offensively bad but certainly not as good as it's predecessor.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

An end to rule all ends.,"Definitely not as good as its predecessor but one to be conjured with nevertheless.
The movie starts a bit slower than all MCU movies before it and it takes its precious time to get the action going, but once it does, its all forgiven and forgotten.
Although predictable, because let's face it, where could they go after Infinity Wars? It delivers on all fronts!
There were tears and laughter throughout the 3 hr long feature. The tears yanked out of you by Ant Man, Stark, Cap and Hawkeye and the laughter mainly by Thor who surprised everybody with his transformation, but also by Hulk/Banner who found a peaceful way to co-exist.
There were cameos sprinkled throughout the whole length of the movie, some very emotional, like Agent Carter, who actually didn't have to say a single word to get the tears flowing.
They tied up all the loose ends, revisited some great scenes from past beloved movies and, thankfully, did not give all the glory to insipid Captain Marvel, who despite being the most powerful of all the Avengers, delivers quite a forgettable performance.
There are some key characters who will definitely not be coming back, but there is still plenty left for future plots. Although it will feel a lot less exciting with some of the most beloved characters absent from now on.All considered, a very good movie to end it all, one that you may want to watch it again to take it all in as I will be doing. Well done to all involved and a great big thank you for such a ride that spanned for over 10 years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Too Much Over/Under Reviews,"Hurts to be a fan and say something like this.

When we thought we gonna see some action, it took 30 min only. And then back to aftermath dramas again.
I like dramas and deep stories in the movies but we already know these characters stories. why to over-extend that much?

"Great ""ending"" to a saga","Endgame is a great popcorn action movie to ""finish"" a saga of popcorn action movies. This isn't serious entertainment and shouldn't be considered as such, and it reminds me of how George Lucas made Star Wars as an homage to the cheap serials like Flash Gordon. Especially as comic-sourced material, this is what the MCU is. Some part of me is actually a bit pained to like it as much as I do, given that it is just playing on base emotions to make money for a massive conglomerate like Disney.BUT... what a great way to end several major storylines that they invested in over the past 11 years. For people who have watched the saga, I feel like this is just the cherry on the top. My only complaint is something that you can't really get away from in superhero stories: the character ""powers"" are totally inconsistent from scene to scene, and movie to movie. This is a trope that there's no getting away from, because if characters like Captain Marvel, Thor, Scarlet Witch, and Hulk were always as powerful as they show flashes of, then the story wouldn't even be a thing. Any one of them could destroy Thanos in the blink of an eye, and have done similar feats in other stories (and even in other scenes within a given story). That they sometimes ""reduce"" their power to a lower level, without an explained mechanism, is pretty laughable, and makes some parts of the story a bit nonsensical. Yes, this constant Ex Machina is needed to maintain the drama and keep the plot going, but it's still something that takes me out of the story.What I really love about this movie, and the saga as a whole, is how good it is at developing the actual characters and their relationships. There are some similarities, but nobody is the same, and most of the arcs are believable. Thor's story, and apparent PTSD, is to me the best-done, but all of the majors (and some of the minors) are almost as good. I believed them. And for a popcorn action movie saga based on a comic series, I think that's a pretty high compliment.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A Masterpiece,"Wow there are so many troll reviews by inarticulate rubes who can't even explain their opinions.People are entitled to their own tastes, and the super hero genre of the Marvel variety that is a pastiche of action/adventure, sci-fi, and fantasy doesn't appeal to everyone, but for what it is, for what it succeeds at being for its target audience, Avengers: Endgame is currently the benchmark as a satisfying grand finale in a cinematic universe.There can be no doubt that Infinity War and Endgame are masterpieces. That doesn't mean they're the best movies ever made, or that they're better than other masterpieces of different genres, it just means that it succeeds in every element required of it.The barrier of entry to The Avengers, especially the last two films, is quite high and requires someone to watch a lot of movies, and without an investment in those characters in the Marvel film that lead up to Infinity War and Endgame, a casual viewer will not care the same way a fan will. Yet that shouldn't detract from how skillfully the writers and directors manage to balance so many elements and fuse so many genres to deliver a unique piece of pop-entertainment that is full of humor, spectacle, and drama.The Avengers is not a particularly profound franchise. It doesn't attempt to be allegorical like The Lord of The Rings, it isn't as mind-expanding as The Matrix, it isn't as mystical as the original Star Wars, nor does it make any social commentary like The Dark Knight, but it has plenty of great archetypal characters who embody different aspects and struggles with heroism. Each character plays so well off the other and the cast has so much chemistry.No other franchise understands its characters better than Marvel, and no writers have a better grasp of heroic conflict and camaraderie than Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. Comparing their work in Endgame to other franchises like the DCU's Justice League or the current Star Wars is night and day.That isn't to say Endgame is perfect. A Masterpiece doesn't have to be perfect, and most aren't. Certain elements of the plot feel rushed and loopholes are glossed over. Not all the jokes land, but most are pretty funny. Captain Marvel is way too powerful which constantly makes her a Deus Ex Machina. There are any combination of nitpicky observations I could make about parts that don't exactly make sense, but those are minor.Admittedly, I do have a bit of Marvel fatigue after this. It almost feels like Endgame was so epic that I don't ever need to see another super hero movie again. Sure, I'll probably see the new Spider-Man, and even though I really like the films and the character, it's reaching a point of over-saturation.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

The End is Part of the Journey.,"I have never wrote a review about any movie I watch. I just feel that I have to document what just touched my heart. Growing up in the Middle East, specifically in Saudi Arabia, without cinema was hard for me. I remember I used to wait months after the movie comes out to watch it online. When I was in college, I used to travel to Bahrain to watch Marvel movies. I enjoyed watching all the movies. I have developed a strong connection with all the characters. I feel what they feel, I understand what they understand. It became a part of my life. My friends, even my close friends, used to make fun of me for watching superheroes movies. They always say that there is no story it is all CGI, what are you watching it for? They do not understand the creativity of developing characters and flashbacks, let alone understanding a complex plot with many planets and universes. I am so happy that I made it to the U.S and watched the movie in the opening day. With that said, Avengers: Endgame is one of the most epic movies I have ever seen. I laughed too loud, cried too hard, and smiled a lot. I will not write any spoilers, I am not that guy, but I wanted to share some of the feelings that I experienced in these epic three hours. The movie has everything perfect the writing, acting, and directing are all outstanding. If there is one wish that I could have in life is that watching this movie with someone I love who have the same admiration for Marvel movies. To the creators, actors and actresses, people behind the scene, and everyone participated in creating it I cannot thank you enough for what you have done.

"Absolutely amazing, but still flawed.","After waiting for a year, Avengers: Endgame hit the theatres and shattered a number of box office records worldwide. But, was it really so perfectly great? No.Good : The first thing I loved about this movie was that it was the most character driven film in the MCU till date. In particular, Hawkeye and Black Widow got the most of character shine. And, it didn't have much of Captain Marvel. As someone who feels awkward when she comes on screen, it was a good thing. It did a great job of serving the fans. So many crowd pleasing moments! I was literally jumping and whistling when I was watching this film, literally. The third act is full of those moments. Those moments do come along with really good character background, a story and excitement. All of these do not make complete sense, but at least they weren't blant. And, many parts are quite nostalgic. It has tried it's best to give every character a proper arc. Performances are incredible. I didn't even hate Don Cheadle in this movie. On the whole, it was insanely entertaining and has ridiculous amount of great moments to say the least.Mixed : It's not a spoiler to say it's a time travel film. While this plot device served a lot to give us a lot of crowd pleasing moments, each of which I really loved, the whole time travel part could've been even more epic and exciting than it was. There were parts in Infinity War where it jumped from plotline to plotline. This one does the same, but it looked more choppy here. Not necessarily a bad thing, a movie of this scale would have such problems. But it was a bit more distracting than before. I admit I liked many arcs given to the characters. But, they were still a bit illogical, in particular that of Steve Rogers. Many things were entertaining as hell, but still quite paradoxical.Bad : It's a time travel movie. It generates a lot many plot holes and inconsistencies. It uses time travel as an excuse for getting certain things done. It has the most generic issues of a non sci-fi time travel movie. The timeline surely is messed up now. I don't know how the time travel in this universe works and how certain things were amended due to all of these time travelling stuffs. May be I will never know. And Thanos. He was treated more like a mustache twirling villain, rather than how he was in Infinity War. The way his character ended was the most disappointing part of the movie. It feels as if it tries to be as big as Infinity War while it clearly isn't.Conclusion : You can and must watch this film. It's a film by the Russo Brothers, you can definitely count on them for an entertaining film, but this is perhaps their weakest film in the MCU. It isn't well paced as Infinity War is, but still gives all the moments you can wish for. Infinity War is a whole lot better than this film, but is still a worth watching flick. If you stop thinking about the inconsistencies time travel creates in this film, this will be a much better experience.Rating.Score : 8.9/10Grade : A",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Don't believe all the hype!,"Spoiler free.....
For those who have given this a 10, take that with a pinch of salt, it really isn't. There's a strong argument that suggests infinity war was an overall better film.
Endgame drags in places as it tries to cram in so much more, building up to a noteably predictable ending.
The direction some of the characters have taken this time around is polarising and didn't work for me. Some key MCU characters going forward we're also given limited screen time which, for those keen to know what the future holds.. I'm not sure anyone really knows now.Whilst the changing of the guard will be welcomed you do get a sense of, this is really the end of a great journey for marvel. Barring a series of solo follows ups and a play in the tv series space we're unlikely to see an avengers style films of this magnitude anytime soon!I've always been a fan ever since the iron man graced our screens, however for me, they have slipped up quite a few times along the way (Thor series) was poor and captain marvel was average.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Why endgame is so good.,Endgame is definitely one of my favourite films out there. Love the cast there all great and it's got a really fantastic plot and follows on so well from infinity war which in my opinion was slightly better. However endgame does not mess up infinity war but in fact enhances it and makes it much better by covering up lose ends that were left in infinity war. Beautifully done with a great cast great acting lots of sacrifice and an absolutely beautiful ending that for me will be hard to match. This film is definitely practically perfect in my opinion. It may get very very slightly slow in parts but it is still a fantastic film and well worth the watch.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Amazing Movie,"This movie concludes 22 movies over a span of 11 years. This journey has been a emotional roller coaster, starting from Iron Man in 2008. Endgame properly complements its predecessor Infinity War.
This is made by people who do, for people who do, and this movie itself, does, love the MCU. You can think of it as a finale. After 22 movies that are all feature length.. Where the equally masterful Infinity War was almost one long action climax, this is less about fights. Which doesn't mean it doesn't have any. Or that they're anything less than excellent. And this film is definitely never boring. This focuses on character exploration. Every member of the original Avengers team, and a handful individuals that aren't, all get significant depth.
In this movie everyone is pushed into a situation new to them. The trailers hint at some of these, whilst leaving others as incredible surprises. It amazes me how such a large cast was accommodated pretty well in the movie.
If you are a Marvel fan make sure you carry tissues with yourself.
Russo Brothers have done a great job. It's got a lot of fun action. The action scenes were good the movie has some events which kept it from becoming predictable. There were many stories which kept it exciting. I liked the bond between the hero's. The jokes were funny and it really felt like a family. All the visuals looked amazing. From the spaceships to the planets the CGI was flawless. I loved it. It showed that the creators put their heart and soul into making this movie. Avengers Endgame is an absolute treat.

"Plot holes and other blockbuster weaknesses, but it is impressive in how well it lands this huge beast in a way that satisfies and delivers","Much like I did for Infinity War, I was caught up a little bit on the hype, but mostly I think I prioritized seeing this so that I could browse Reddit again, since so many popular posts are memes from the final two Avengers films. Unsurprisingly perhaps, I found that it was very much the overall picture I found with Infinity War, which is that it is far from perfect, a blockbuster pure and simple, but that it is quite a piece of work in terms of how well put together it all is.In terms of that structure, at time of writing this there are quite a few comments comparing it to the final season of Game of Thrones (which right now just has 2 episodes left) in the way that it has to bring everything together. The comparison is unfavorable, partly because GoT continues it very rushed approach to writing, but mainly because Endgame does it very well. The detail of the plotting is of course filled with holes that are best just to ignore, but the structure allows for a very nice conclusion as we retouch on moments from within the existing films, allowing nostalgia, references, and a sense of winding it up (although of course it will continue as long as the films make money). As with Infinity War, the writing somehow gives characters enough time despite there being so many of them; it hits several tones but none undercuts or takes away from another; and it mixes humor and action into a plot that takes itself seriously enough so it feels like it has weight.Of course it is still a blockbuster film, and far from perfect, but it is impressively done and very easy to enjoy if you go with what it is doing.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Infinity War was the moment we were all waiting for and then they tell us they are going to split it into two films. End Game could have gone south with this choice, but it did not. It's always exciting, especally if you are a comic book fan or have been watching these movies for now eleven years.
Don't want to say too much, but shine a light on Robert Downey Jr. who got to perfect his Iron Man persona to the point where Hugh Jackman can't even surpass him. Captain American is giving all us FanBoys everything we ever wanted to see and Thor...underperforms with hilarious results (and hopefully will create 2019's most popular costume for a certain type of man).

A fitting farewell to an incredible era,"DISCLAIMER- This is a spoiler FREE reviewWell, here we are.After 11 year's of top quality entertainment and planning that started all the way back with 2008's surprise smash hit Iron Man (do you feel old yet? I sure do), this part of Marvel's world domination comes to an end with what's likely to be one of, if not the biggest film's of all time, The Avengers: Endgame.It's a somewhat odd, occasionally emotional and fitting experience sitting back and concluding this part of the Marvel universe and while we know there's countless more Marvel film's coming our way, Endgame really does feel like the culmination of year's of hard work and adventures, that while not perfect, feels like a fitting tribute to what's come before and what still lays ahead.It's incredibly hard to talk about Endgame in depth without ruining the narrative the Russo brother's and their team have created but suffice to say the creative minds behind the scenes have given us another top quality piece of blockbuster filmmaking, that's likely to please diehard fans and more casual cinemagoers alike, the only problem is, when compared to it's genuinely surprising and perfectly paced predecessor, Endgame does feel slightly more formulaic and long in the tooth.It's picky for sure, but Infinity War gave us a Marvel experience that was unexpected, hilarious, emotional and epic and while Endgame has this in parts, it's not as all encompassing as last year's experience, even if by the rulebook, this was never going to be the case when tying up so many loose ends and finalising so much of what has come before it over the year's.A lot of these endings and plot tie ups will please those that have invested so much into a series that has been operating on an extremely high level for a number of year's, it's just that Marvel almost outdid themselves in Infinity War, making the more by the numbers plot threads and leaps of logic found in Endgame more highlighted than usual.The other minor nitpick with the film is Endgames much talked about epic 3 hour runtime and while the film starts with some unexpected and emotionally charged instances, there's a clear late beginning and middle section of the film that at times drags and cover's similar ground one too many times, even if by relative terms, the runtime in the Russo's film never is too detrimental to the fun to be had.This fun comes in many forms, with particular highlights being Thor's new found lifestyle, the Hulk's more prominent role and Captain Marvel's addition to the Avengers family, while the films big action scenes (that must be said aren't that abundant) are a sight to behold, with Marvel once more showing off their ability to handle spectacles as good as, if not better than, everyone else.At the end of the day, it's been an incredible period for Marvel, with arguably no outright failures and an abundance of big winners, we've been spoilt for 11 straight year's and while Endgame may not be the best of the best, it's still a mighty fine and emotionally charged finale that does the beloved cinematic universe proud.Final Say -While not as surprising or even as Infinty War, Endgame is still a top quality and fitting end to so much good work that's come before it and while it's sad to say goodbye to this particular era, it's exciting to see what lays in store for Marvel moving ahead.4 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches out of 5",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Plot holes galore. Overrated.,"Believe it or not, I expected this storyline. That Thanos would destroy the stones and Avengers will move on until they find a way to travel back in time. I said I hope it wasn't using Quantum realm because it would be repeatable. And that's exactly what happened.The movie is plagued by plot holes. I will not go over all of them but I spent over an hour after the movie listing all the plot holes to my daughter. The biggest and the most ridiculous one is that the Avengers had only enough Pym particles for one round trip each. Movie made a big deal about this. But towards the end, Thanos uses one vial of Pym particle on his ship with everyone on board. With thousands of minion creatures on it. With no special ""Quantum"" suit or equipment. You mean to tell me Avengers could've just got on a vehicle and teleport all together with one vial? And with Hank Pym back now, they can time travel at will from now on. Or go back in time to get more just like they did in the movie. This completely ruins the Marvel Universe.Avengers can travel back in time where they first made the Ironman version of Infinity Gauntlet. Borrow it, defeat any villain with a snap, and return it to exact moment. Avengers of the past will understand since they did same thing when retrieving the stones.Also now everyone is Antman. Everyone can shrink, go to Quantum realm, and time travel. Nothing special about Antman now. These are just fraction of all the plot holes.There also was a huge plot hole fail in The Last Jedi when Holdo sliced Snoke's mothership by going lightspeed. Which ruined the Star Wars Universe. And these rivals that plot hole.Their version of time travel is a big mess too. It says past and future is not connected and changing past doesn't effect future but there are parts where it shows the new past effecting the future. And they were making fun of Back to the Future.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Ok hear me out,"This is getting a 10/10 mostly because how it doesnt flop on its head ending a 22 movie long plot. Is this the best marvel movie? No not even close, is this as good as infinity war? No, me 2 months ago would say it is but me now would say other wise. But simply for the experience of seeing the first iron man in theaters when I was 8 to now me as 19 and making me cry it is easily a 10/10 due to it being like no other experience. If it wasnt an ending to a 22 movie long era than mayhe my score would reflect like an 8 or a 7, but due to it being what it is I am willing to bump it up. It is still better than like 15 marvel movies, it's still up there for one of their stronger movies. It's not as good as infinity war and winter soldier is still my favorite marvel movie not counting spiderman movies.TLDR: Its simply unlike any experience in film yet, having a movie end a 22 movie long story and not flop on its face, usually movies cant finish a 3 movie long story without flopping, yet this movie managed to do it with a 22 movie long story. It isnt the best marvel movie, far from it, I would argue that infinity war is a much better movie, but I would say that this is my 2nd favorite avengers movie",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

What a ride!,"Don't enter the theatre with preconceived notions of what you wanted them do do with this movie, no. Instead let it unfold as Infinity Wars did, an unexpected storm. This movie was epic, the acting, the cinematography, the story, the mixture and combinations of joy, pai, and suspense...all the years of a finally woven Marvel heroic tapestry. Finished. But in a way that leaves me yearning for more, but relishing the memories of the characters I once simply read about as a child from the 60s to seeing them in the big screen like never before. Man this was a great movie! A must see. Hollywood Oscar folks time to stop overlooking these cinematic treasures. There were some Oscar worthy performances in here.

Good Movie But Not Infinity War Kinda Good ....,"Tamed Hulk, traumatized Ironman, fantasy of yesterday - Cap America. what did I do with my hair - Cpt Marvel . Dr Stranger things and many more with fault of not their own were part of the final movie in one of the most successful and entertaining spectacles of the past decade.The movie itself was a huge collection of familiar faces and scenes, from all major events in MCU, lacking cohesive structure which distorted flow of the movie. The spectacle was too long and action sequences were unevenly spaced which created over too long moments that were more about homage to the last decade of superhero bonanza and tremendous logistic achievement. After all getting all of the cameo actors from the last movies and inserting them into this plot must have been very difficult. Did they suceed ? No, they did not. The effort was admirable and gave us some really touching moments but resulted in unnecessary extending already too long movie. This was confusing the main story plot too much. There were just too much of it. Movie did not offer viewer any spectacular skirmishes in a first two hours. Thats what made IW so special. Endgage was lacking these impactful moments. It is clear that the best was saved for last but this only validates that movie did not have to be so long. If a movie would be filled with IW level of awesome than yeah, bring it on but the problem is that it was stretched too thin and these moments are just not there, not in the beginning anyway.PG-12 rating is a culprit here. If movie's rating was higher I am sure that scenes filled with nothing would be at least more electryfying but because this is a movie aimed at future and former fans, the lighter representation of after apocalypse universe was the only thing Disney corporate machine could have come up with and still get away with achieving PG-12 rating. Younger audience and older audience looked bored in the cinema though. The balance was not achieved here.The final stand off was amazing though and I will say that it is worth the price of admission. When I will be rematching Endgame on blue ray I think I will just skip to the last few chapters just to experience all this wonderfully done explosions and amazingly done fights. It was just epic and the team definitely raised the bar here.Overall the movie was ok but it did not top IW for me. This one will still be the best Avenger movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

The endgame of over 22 films, a saga spanning 11 years has culminated into something so powerful, so awe inspiring on the screen, I urge every one to watch it to feel firsthand, the beauty, the pain and triumph of our heroes.The movie picks up right where the previous left off. It allows the viewer some time to cope with the devastation wrecked by Thanos in the previous film. It is remarkable and therefore worth noting that every trailer issued for this movie comes in the first 20 mins of the movie and hence everything afterwards is such a whirlwind. The movie gives nod to some of our favourite moments in the past films and still continues to give.You will have many naysayers. Dont listen to them. The movie is powerful.

The visuals are stunning and the cast and crew goes all out to give us the cinematic event of a lifetime.The movie features a strong and engaging plot with directors Anthony and Joe Russo clearly showing us that they know what they're doing. Character arcs across the board come to a satisfying conclusion and just remind us why we, as fans, have invested this much in these films the past 11 years.Bring your tissues, because this is without a doubt the most emotional adventure that Marvel has put us on as an audience. Emotional scenes are backed up by Alan Silvestri's stunningly beautiful and goosebump-inducing soundtrack, with many callbacks to previous MCU movies that prove that this is a worthy conclusion.Incredibly astounding and emotionally affecting end to a saga that started with a billionaire in a cave with a box of scraps and a scrawny kid from Brooklyn who just wanted to do the right thing.Go see this film; you will not regret it at all.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Is it worth it?,"After 21 films worth of waiting, Marvel has finally reached the conclusion to the Infinity Saga in Avengers: Endgame. The collective movies had mad billions of dollars, and captured the hearts of comic book fans around the world. The prior entry, Avengers: Infinity War added a certain sense of gravitas and catharsis to the Marvel Universe. The prior film left fans not only devastated, but with more questions than answers with it's cliffhanger, serial ending. So how does the conclusion fare? Are the Fallen avenged? Is Endgame worth the hype?One of my greatest praises of Shazam! was the amount of personal consequence it had. One of my biggest criticisms of most superhero movies is that the consequence is constantly about saving the world. This then makes saving the world a redundant outcome that we know the superheroes will eventually solve. With constant resurrections and story revisions, the Marvel Universe greatly lacked this. Yet even though the world saving was still the primary conflict of Endgame, the story contained personal consequence for each individual character that made the film far more endearing to the viewer. This filled the film with incredibly written, visceral moments of joy, pain, and everything in between.The amount of story-boarding that went into the film is insane. The run time is long, but a necessary evil to the human bladder to tie up so many loose ends within an incredibly convoluted plot. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has so many characters, and Endgame gives resolution to their individual strife, while raising questions that can be pursued in future films. It gives each character their own space in the spotlight while concurrently sharing it equally. It is absolute brilliant direction by the Russo brothers.I cannot justifiably call Endgame the singular greatest superhero film of all time. Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy is still brilliant, and did not need 21 films of buildup. Yet it absolutely rivals the trilogy with the first Marvel film that takes a chance with the ultimate pathos. The film rewards the fans who have seen all of the films, even the poorer entries, while inviting new fans with instant accessibility. I never checked my watch, I never felt the need to get up from my seat, which is something that has never occurred for me within a three hour movie. Not every direction choice worked as intended, not every story point was logistically flawless, but it still works. I laughed, I cried, and sometimes even did bof. Not both, but BOF.

Avengers: Endgame sticks the landing,"Go ahead and watch the trailers for Avengers: Endgame, they won't give anything major away. It's amazing for a huge movie to be so self-aware of itself, as well as, the movie genres that they're overtly borrowing from. The minor characters or those not even in Avengers: Infinity War, step up and help set up huge sequences that are highly entertaining and actually answer questions. Avengers: Endgame acknowledges every aspect of the characters emotions in their previous MCU film's and succeeds in the most Meta way possible.Ant-Man is a major reason for this. It's no spoiler to say that he's in the film as he produces some of the biggest laughs from the trailer of him ringing the bell at the Avenger's front gate. It's Paul Rudd's wry jokes, quick timing and fish out of water facial expressions that really assist things.The pacing of Avengers: Endgame is amazing and not for the reasons you might think. It's brilliantly paced, but it throws the entire formula and how MCU films are done on their head. Battle, loss, battle, loss, humor and then victory, take those ingredients, shake well and you've got a loose description of some average superhero films.If Avengers: Infinity War left you feeling betrayed and bummed out, I feel you. Avengers: Endgame more than makes up for any ill feelings that it caused. I see why they played it the way they did, and doing so any other way would've cheapened the film, watered down the MCU and made it all disposable. It is also worth noting that the film balance lots of humor with the drama, all the while putting it in a nice bow with stones.What we're left with is a 10 year opus that spans more arcs than Lord of the Rings and encapsulates it all in a perfect manner. Granted, they will still make many MCU films, this is not their swan song. However, there is a victory lap feeling about Avengers: Endgame. It respects the fans, adds to the dramatic elements, answers questions that fans have wondered about and plants a couple new seeds to grow on.Is Avengers: Endgame OK for children? If your child has seen any MCU film then they'll be OK with this. The film has fair number of bad words, but the violence is on par with what younger fans are accustomed to.

A Satisfying Conclusion,"Avengers Endgame Review
Score - 10/10
Avengers Endgame could be well described as the most complicated storyline in the entire Marvel history not only because it had to wrap up a story of eleven years but also because of the complex solution to an inevitable situation that The Avengers try to achieve with the avenging not being the major part of the story.
The three hour runtime was well utilized by giving more time to establish the characters' humanistic attachments and the losses they suffered; not only in this movie, but from the very moment they've been incepted into this franchise.
Unlike the previous outings, the characters differ in their choices and these contrasts in their choices lead up to one massive and satisfying final battle which may not end the entire MCU, but certainly does end a glorious era of the long franchise.
The entire movie, especially the final battle was a huge fan service as it included everything a Marvel fan could possibly dream of.

A disappointment when compared to Infinity War but still a fun watch for fans.,"I saw this with my entire family in a theater.
It was house full with too much clapping n whistling n some of the dialogues went bouncer. Will watch it again but I feel it is not on par with Infinity War.
In Infinity War, the war sequence n the fight scenes were all shot in broad daylight n that too in an open field of Wakanda without the fast paced camera tricks. It was visible who was fighting who but Endgame's war sequence is shot in the dark with too much fast paced camera tricks. At times it became hectic to make out who is fighting who.
The entry of Thor during the war in Infinity was epic but in Endgame it was duds.

hot mess,"The whole thing is just a disaster. The very premise, that Thanos thinks getting rid of half of the living things in the universe (not half the human or half the sentient beings, but half the cows & half the chickens & half the space creatures too) is just to dumb to handle. A five-year-old could tell you that's a stupid plan, and yet we're supposed to believe a Titan can't see the flaw in it? (I'd say the single bright spot here is Steve Rogers's backside. Truly, America's ass.)",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Monumental. Breathtaking. The end of an era.,"I'm among those people, who normally don't engage in writing reviews. But this time I really have and want to. I rewatched the infinity-saga prior to Engame's release and there couldn't have been a better ending to it then the one it got. It really has been an epic ride and I feel privileged to have been able to be a part of it. Though only being a spectator, I feel connected to these characters, they are like long know friends. Endgame is the epic and monumental end to the saga which began over a decade ago. And oh it is more then worthy to be the last milestone on this incredible journey. I went through so many emotions watching this, joy, pride, happiness, sorrow and a sense of being alive and what it means to be human. Just watch it, you'll see what I mean, I really don't promise too much.

A MARVELOUS END GAME,"After 11 years and 22 movies, Marvel Studios brought us the most ambitious movie, the greatest culmination, it is nostalgic, sentimental and completely unexpected. All the characters are so well-balanced, to each one is given plenty of screen time to development. If you're a marvel fan you'll feel like you're finally complete, you've never seen anything like this before, there are many references to all the 22 movies and there is a certain inevitability about the plot, there are plenty surprises. The movie present us an incredible balancing between nostalgia and novelty, you will scream, laugh and cry, it is the Marvel recipe elevated to the highest level. There's just so much in it, that I can't even write about it without spoiling everything. This is not the end for Marvel, but it certainly marks an ending for several of the characters we've watched and loved over the last decade, there will be more superhero franchises but it's hard to imagine any one being so culturally resonant.

Marvel sticks the landing with its Endgame,"This is a historic movie. The story that Marvel and Disney crafted for over a decade comes to its conclusion in an epic 3-hour film that is for the ages.All the characters, some of which we've known and loved for years and others we just met, get their share of love and their time to shine, with cheers and applause ensuing several times. There were tears aplenty, but also quite a few laugh, in particular from a character you don't usually think of as comic relief. The movie takes time to show us the unbearable loss of Infinity War and how the Avengers each deal with it, before a way to bring back all of the victims of the Snap appears. But don't think you know how this is going to go because whenever you think THAT was the big twist, there's probably another one coming.New abilities are revealed, emotional arcs are fulfilled and heroes change as Marvel lays the ground work for its next phase that will officially start after the release of Spider-Man: Far from Home this summer. Endgame ends with an open door to the MCU's future, but for the first time since its beginning, the movie does not feature a post-credit scene, leaving us wondering what's to come.I feel like this is the kind of movie I'll be happy to say I saw in the theater the day it came out 30 years from now when they remake it for the third time. This is a once in a generation cultural phenomenon and I hope you go see it in the theatre because you will not regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Not an MCU fan, but really enjoyed this","No spoilers!!Being a sceptic of Marvel movies for a long time, I had low expectations going into Endgame. I didn't love Infinity War, but I wanted to see this film opening weekend to avoid spoilers and see how the 10-year culmination of the MCU concluded. Well, I was pleasantly surprised with the film. It's not without its issues, but Endgame felt like one of the most unique and captivating Marvel films to date. I was very surprised at how easily I was engaged throughout the 3-hour runtime. The film breaks down into three parts, each part having its pros and cons. Personally, I thought the first act was the weakest and overstayed its welcome. Despite that, there were still some interesting parts that helped flesh out the aftermath of Infinity War. The second and third act felt very original and had many surprising moments that kept me guessing what would happen next. However, there were parts that felt VERY fan servicey. Of course, some of the fan service was fine, but at other points it felt like a little much.One of the great things about this movie was that it broke from the simple MCU formula. It has a much different story than any of the other MCU films and utilizes much different plot mechanisms to make it feel more original. The emotional range of the film was another thing that felt different to me compared to many other MCU films. I thought the humor in this film was handled much better, causing me to laugh multiple times. Not only was the film funny at points, but it also had some sad, depressing, exciting, and thrilling sequences. This film, unlike some other MCU films, was able to have some very serious moments and did not have to cut the emotional tension by inserting a cheesy one-liner.Despite it being a much more original and emotionally driven film compared to other MCU films, it did have some shortcomings. I think that some of the fan service took me out of the film because it felt either overdramatic or forced. There were times were I caught myself rolling my eyes at how overdramatic or socially 'woke' the movie was being. One scene in particular felt like a blatant advertisement in the middle of the film, which was jarring and cringe worthy. There were also many moments of the film that could have been explained to help bring more tension, but instead were brushed over in order to fit everything into a reasonably lengthed film. I think there were parts that should have been cut or shorted and other parts that should have been extended. Lastly, I thought that Thanos was misused in this film. I was excited to see his role in this film but was left disappointed by his role as the villain.As someone who wouldn't consider themselves a Marvel fan, I had fun watching this movie regardless of it having some issues. I would definitely recommend it if you have been following the MCU at all recently, but I probably don't need to do that because everyone and there mother is going to see this. Overall, I thought it was enjoyable and quite possibly my favorite Marvel film.P.S. It feels satisfying to have this chapter of superhero movies come to a close. I hope that it will make way for more innovative and interesting films, whether they are superhero related or not.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Keeping it simple - it was average,"Not going to go into any spoilers I just felt that overall the movie was average, it did a lot of things right and a lot of things wrong. The acting was decent, the action scenes were good if few and short and the pacing wasn't atrocious.But there were flaws, Brie Larson could have been replaced by a cardboard cut out, some of the twists made little sense and the big fight was rather unsatisfying and had a really cringy scene (you'll know it when you see it)Ultimately it's worth watching but the people rating this a 10 are overly hyped or wearing blinders because there were more than enough flaws evident throughout the movie. Basically go in expecting an alright action flick and you'll enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

I was literally sticked to my seat for 3 hours, even during the interval, I was like I want to see the whole movie in one length. Tell you the truth, I was not much impressed with Infinity wars or Ragnarok (not even mentioning captain marvel here xD), but Russo brothers just nailed this one.

All of the main characters give pinnacle performances here (one in particular, which you might have a guess but I will refrain from saying here).Hours later, I am still mostly speechless.

Was endgame $400 million to make?

Great end to a storied franchise? Kind of. This is nowhere near the cinematic greatness of LOTR: Return of the King. That was a true film through and through. Endgame is monster budget with 80% boring monologue and corny jokes. If that's what you enjoy then all power to you.Endgame has less action than any other Avengers film which I found incredibly disappointing and a let down.Would I recommend you to see endgame? Don't be silly, this is generational movie. Generational in the sense of big money, big actors, mega marketing and big answers to a beloved storyline of multiple hero's. Marvel movies are popular because we have been told by everyone we have to love them. If you have one bad thing to say about a Marvel movie, you will become more isolated than Tom Hanks in Castaway.

"Good, but slightly underwhelming","Don't get me wrong, the movie was great. There were some very epic moments and some very sad moments. However, it was way too long. Without getting into spoilers, I found myself pretty bored within the first hour.80% of EndGame was really just a fan service/tribute to the MCU fans who watched all the previous MCU titles (most of which I saw). Even after the ~30 mins climatic battle (which was the best part of the film), however, the movie somehow continues to drag itself on again.I also felt there were some plot holes in the story/concepts; I had trouble understanding how it all worked.The humor was alright, but it is of typical MCU-grade comedy.

A decent end of an era.,"Infinity war was overall a better movie, but this movie had the disadvantage of being the follow up to that movie. A good chunk of this movie is essentially remembering what happened during infinity war. The struggle against Thanos in this movie... It just isnt done in a satisfying way.Before Infinity war came out last year, it was already confirmed there would be another Avengers follow up this year. It was speculated that Endgame was actually going to be called ""Infinity war part 2"". Unfortunately, this is Endgame, but it SHOULD have been Infinity war part 2. I know that is very vague, Im trying to be vague, but essentially because of what happened in Infinity War, it was pretty much impossible to make a sequel which feels like it even is the same story with the same consistency & epic feel. Or at least, that is not what we got.Captain Marvel kinda sucks in this movie. She is a boring character with magic powers. Ughhh great. In hindsight, the tease in Infinity war was cool, but it makes it into a big letdown. And this is kind of the story of the whole movie, if Infinity War was the teaser. (Although it isnt quite that bad, this movie is still pretty good, unlike Captain Marvel in it.)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

STOP GIVING THIS A 10,"This movie was the end of 22 movies... Supposed to be the most intense movie of all time. Yet infinity war had way more emotion and way better script. I even think that age of ultron was better. All they focused on was linking all the 22 movies into one and fan service. I feel for that reason it wasn't as impactful as infinity war. The way they end the characters stories was ok, i would have done it differently and done something that would make your heart drop, like they did in the first 5 min of the movie. And also they did something to a certain character and all i can say is WHY, SO STUPID. 7 may seem like a descent rating but i am very disappointed because this movie had unlimited potential and now i'll never get to see the endgame i wanted to.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Spoiler Free Review,"Avengers: Endgame (SPOILER FREE) Review:After the devastating events of Avengers: Infinity War (2018), the universe is in ruins. With the help of remaining allies, the Avengers assemble once more in order to undo Thanos' actions and restore order to the universe. Avengers: Endgame is literally one of, is not the, most anticipated film ever. This review is probably going to be shorter since its spoiler free and I have to be vague. I should have a spoiler review up soon (Monday is apparently the day we can talk about the spoilers according to the Russo Brothers). So this is a little late. I saw it last week Saturday and just saw it again last night. I wanted to see if it had the same effect as it did on first viewing. I'm pleased to say that I absolutely loved this film and even more than Infinity War. It's a great story that brings all 22 films in the Infinity Saga to a bittersweet end. The plot is much darker than any Marvel film. The first act was a drama where they're all realizing the events of what happened and it gets a good perspective for the audience. We saw in Infinity War that it affected the superheroes and some people but it makes us all think of the entire universe. It's tragic really. This is also when we get the most character development in any of the films. We see their true feelings. Now I could go on and on about how there wasn't a single bad performance by anyone, but I would like to talk about one. I'm currently on the petition that Robert Downey Jr. should get an Oscar nomination or at least a Golden Globe nomination for his performance. I believe this is his peak performance and he put all his emotions into it. The scenes at the beginning and end are his best though. Some brought me to tears. It's a very emotional film and I don't know how one could go in to it with at least tearing up. So Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus, amazing job with the script. No line felt out of place. Everything came off natural. And also the Russo Brothers did their finest work directing and they're some of the best right now. There's so much to say about those but that's all I can say without giving it away. Now for the technical aspects. Alan Silvestri's score was interesting and beautiful because it had the original melodies like the previous Avengers films but this time he created new melodies that, for me at least, are just as memorable as the Avengers Theme. Also my favorite score of the year so far. The visual effects were good as usual and worked well with the chaos of the action, especially the final battle. Speaking of battles some say you could leave for the action since it's all the same and there was too much going on, but I strongly disagree. There is no time to get up and leave during this film. The cinematography was at its best of the franchise with Trent Opaloch as the cinematographer. And I think I'll leave my review at that. For more content I will have my spoiler review soon. I think this was an amazing film that brings the series all together. I'm pleased to say I liked it more than Infinity War and it's my favorite film of the year just beating Us. Therefore this is my first perfect film of the year. Please go see it if you haven't. I think this film is special and one you can never forget.My Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Avengers: Endgame,"""Avengers: Endgame"" is the culmination of a decade of blockbuster filmmaking, the result of years of work from thousands of people. It is designed to be the most blockbuster of all the blockbusters, a movie with a dozen subplots colliding, and familiar faces from over 20 other movies. It's really like nothing that Hollywood has produced before, existing not just to acknowledge or exploit the fans of this series, but to reward their love, patience, and undying adoration. The blunt thing you probably want to know most: It's hard to see serious MCU fans walking away from this disappointed. It checks all the boxes, even ticking off a few ones that fans won't expect to be on the list. It's a satisfying end to a chapter of blockbuster history that will be hard to top for pure spectacle. In terms of sheer entertainment value, it's on the higher end of the MCU, a film that elevates its most iconic heroes to the legendary status they deserve and provides a few legitimate thrills along the way.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Second, I know that this movie doesn't exactly have the action throughout because of the time travel plot, well there's a quite a bit of action scenes, but it gives us a enjoyable throwback to the old MCU movies and saves the big blockbuster action for the finale and there's nothing to be said of the finale except for one word: EPIC. Lastly, it really put a good use of the 11 year buildup of our heroes. And you really careabout all of them. And everyone does career-best performances. But the star of the show is RDJ. He's always been great as Tony Stark, but I don't think he was as good as he was in this movie. He honestly deserves an Oscar. And don't listen to haters of this movie please. Just watch it and enjoy it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"It was what I expected, but that's all.","The movie was great, there's no doubt about it, but that was it. Coming off the shock value that Infinity War brought meant that nothing in this film surprised me, actually there really wasn't any surprises- everything was just as you'd expect it, which was slightly disappointing in itself. I remember after infinity war, people in the cinema were speechless, crying, sobbing, hugging each other - there was nothing like that here. I wish there were more surprises. It was also a little slow overall but at the same time a good celebration of the last 11 years.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"Avengers: Endgame is some of the most thrilling, powerful, beautiful, and emotional entertainment ever put on the big screen.","When I walked into the theater for my first viewing of Endgame, I was prepared to see a great superhero movie. I expected some massive fight scenes, a few emotional gut punches, and to walk away with a generic positive message about overcoming obstacles. But I could have never guessed that night that I would cry like a baby, go completely numb from pure awe, and leave the theater with a fresh take on what it really means to be human. It was a night I'll likely remember for the rest of my life.It all started back in 2008 with the first Iron Man, which was soon followed by several other movies based on popular superheroes from Marvel comics. These superheroes became known as Avengers, appearing together in several blockbuster hits to fight world-threatening enemies. Endgame is the culmination of 22 movies across 11 years, and the anticipation and pressure from the fans were higher than ever before. But somehow, Marvel managed to produce an overwhelmingly satisfying conclusion that met or exceeded all expectations.The premise of Endgame's storyline is fairly simple: defeat the mad titan Thanos after he wiped out half the universe's population and bring back everyone he killed. However, it ends up quite complex, dealing with quantum physics and time travel. The directors, Joe and Anthony Russo, do an admirable job of making the storyline easy to follow, bouncing between dozens of different settings and timelines without feeling too cluttered. There are also a surprisingly low number of plot holes considering that the movie deals with time travel.When it comes to pacing, the film has some minor issues. It sometimes feels unnecessarily drawn out during some of the middle sections, where the movie takes a less serious tone and the stakes don't feel quite as high. But it more than makes up for it with an action packed beginning and ending filled with shocking surprises and adrenaline rushes to keep the audience on the edge of their seats.One of the movie's most impressive feats is how it is able to include so many characters without making a single one feel left out. The main characters of this movie are the original six Avengers, which include Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and the Hulk. Apart from the Hulk, who unfortunately does not get much of a spotlight, all of their characters develop beautifully throughout the movie and have several major moments to shine. Iron Man in particular ends up almost the complete opposite of his selfish, egotistical, and ignorant past self. Even Thanos, despite being the main antagonist, has a very interesting arc that affects his grand motives as he learns more about humanity's flaws.As we have come to expect from marvel, the production quality is as good as it gets. The acting performances from all the cast members are easily some of the best they have ever done. Whether through dialogue or simply just facial expressions, the actors and actresses do an amazing job conveying their characters' emotions. The visuals are stunning, with a vibrant color palate and awe inspiring cinematography. The movie relies heavily on cgi, but it is done so well that everything looked completely photorealistic. Accompanying that was a stellar soundtrack by Alan Silvestri that masterfully matches the tone of each scene, elevating them to new heights. ""Portals"" in particular is one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard, and it still gives me major chills every time I listen to it.The movie particularly excels at creating a very atmospheric feel to many of its scenes, using it's soundtrack and visuals to immerse the viewer into its vast world. Some of the best examples of this are in an early scene with Iron Man in a spaceship, which wonderfully captures the melancholic but peaceful tone of the scene. And perhaps the most prominent example is in the iconic ""Portals"" scene, which emanates sheer awe with its beauty and scope, starting slowly and naturally building up to an earth-shattering climax.A common criticism with superhero movies in general is that they are mindless ""popcorn entertainment"" only good for action and surprises. However, with Endgame, this could not be further from the truth. Through the Avengers' personal struggles and Thanos's quest to make a perfect universe, the film goes the extra mile in showing how the world and its people are far from perfect, but our lives can still be beautiful. This idea is especially shown within the deeply moving final few scenes.Avengers: Endgame is a wonderfully thrilling experience for its audience. But it goes a step further and shows us why cinema and storytelling are so important. As Endgame illustrates, emotions are defining characteristics of humanity, and whether good or bad, they shape our lives and allow us to grow. What better way to experience these emotions than through some amazing stories?",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"Say goodbye to the old member six, folks.","Where ""Infinity War"" created havoc, ""Avengers: Endgame"" promised closure. The film is jam-packed with re-enactments of previous films' relationships. It practically requires that viewers do their homework by watching (or rewatching) a dozen previous films. The emphasis switches from lavish, effects-driven demonstrations of universe-saving heroism to the more personal cost of heroism. It establishes that whoever possesses the six all-powerful Infinity Stones may accomplish almost anything by just snapping their fingers. Because there is so much territory to cover in the film, it skips over introductions and presents Captain Marvel's entrance as a foregone conclusion.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
MASTERPIECE,"AND THE WAIT IS OVERInfinity War which gave the world rumbling because of the wrath of Thanos. And here it elevates the emotions of every MCU fans that too right from the stone.I always wanted to brag/say about Endgame but that will end up with too many spoilers. So the plot remains unrevealed.The movie has an ensemble cast feat. all the ones you've known and with the outnumbered super heroes teams up to defeat Thanos, one of the most powerful villain of MCU. He stands out tall in this one too. All superheroes has their own spaces, imprinting themselves in everyone's mind. Endgame portrays the emotions and personal stories of the superheroes and was really touching.Even though Endgame is Visual Masterpiece but rides through the emotions whole throughout but also will make you laugh. Thor, Antman, Hulk and Rocket leads the laughter squad. Captain America was not my fav. hero, but after this he has a special spot in my heart. Iron Man, he was brilliant. All the superheroes will grab a special place in your heart for sure.Russo brothers did a wonderful job in terms of writing and in directing. Endgame is visual treat to the eyes and the finale battle was also well convincing. Technical aspects were outstanding in terms of Camera, Score, CGI, Editing, Art, etc.It's a long 181 minutes movie but you will not take your eyes even for one second.A must watch in Theaters especially in IMAX. a MASTERPIECEI will go out with 10 on 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Polarizing... did not live up to my expectations,"No spoilers.The movie had a nice closing of the past 10 years but is far from the best Marvel movie which I had hoped for.Infinity war is head and shoulders above it due to its high pace and perfect character combinations. Endgame is funny, emotional and provides more depth to main character heroes. However, leaves so many important things out of focus despite its 3 hour runtime. Also, surprisngly feels like the Russos missed many great opportunities to make the movie better.Go and see it! Still important piece if the puzzle.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Hmmmmmm that's a NO from me!,"There must be a lot of brainless fan boys highly rating this movie ... compared to its predecessor (Infinity War) Endgame was a real let down.
I won't reveal spoilers. But I will say the pacing was very bad.... very very slow at the start to the point I was nodding off in the theatre .... the movie before had great pacing of action, drama and comedy...... Endgames first half was just boring.
Also balance of heroes in the first movie was done much better than this movie which really should have been called Captain America & Iron Man + Avengers.
And time travel as a plot device is a very lazy way of solving issues ... I cringed when that came up ........ Thanos and his lieutenants were a threat in Infinity War... in this movie they felt really dumbed down.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

The best conclusion to a decade of wonders.,"I have been giving thoughts if I should still write about Avengers: Endgame. My brain is just blacked out. I cannot think of anything. Maybe because the movie left me broken after seeing it. And I'm afraid that if I try to remember the scenes from the movie, I might end up crying.I felt sad after watching Infinity War, but Endgame just rips your heart out.I was very silent after the movie. I went straight home after watching it. I can't handle it. I just watched the most anticipated movie of 2019 and the excitement and anticipation were replaced with too many emotions that is very impossible to contain. I thought I was ready to watch it, but I wasn't.I haven't written a review that doesn't contain spoilers, so I would like this to be different. And it's really hard to write without spoiling the movie if the very core of the movie is how we are attached to the characters all over these years. We have been rooting for them for too long and seeing the conclusion of the franchise is giving us mixed emotions. All good feelings, I assure you but as I mentioned too much to contain.I will watch it again, not to be broken again, but because this movie might be our last connection to the characters we ever love. (You'll know when you see the movie.)I'm sending this warning to all MCU fans who haven't seen it. Be very ready for every possible and impossible thing that might happen because this movie will give you an emotional blow. You will clap. You will jump. You will shout. You will cheer. You will cry. And heck, you will weep. I know I did. #AvengersEndgame #EndgameReview",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
1 in a 14.000.605..,"After seeing all the 22 movies and some of them even twice I have to say that the last movie of the MCU was perfectly balanced in every aspect. Full of passion, drama, funny scenes, action... it has it all! An almost flawless scenario that left me stumbled by its depth and ode in logike.
This scenario along with the coordination of the Russo Brothers (another proof that brotherhood collaboration excels) truly inspired all actors involved for a great performance. All these years of participations in different movies also enable them all to surpass themselves in acting. That's the success on the MCU in my opinion along with a clearly anthropocentric approach to the character of its heroes .Of course with such an amount of actors playing there will have been some cliques projected more during the film, but their unification under one roof was excellent. Thumbs up also for actor's discretion on leaks on the script.To be honest after I watched with much anticipation Avengers Infinity War in which I have to say I expected more in terms of fights among characters like in the comic books (maybe I was biased due to the numerous action-based trailers), I was prepared for a good but not special endgame.
But on the contrary as Red Skull would say
""We all think we were prepared.. we were all wrong!""A mind elevation for children, a new dimension of sentimental fulfillment for adults..

Avenge The Fallen,"I've grown up with the MCU with Iron Man coming out when I was 5 years old. I love this series and it's sad that the main saga is over but I expected a bit more. I gave Infinity War a 9/10 because of its amazing pace, fun characters and unexpected gut-wrenching ending, but this film has sluggish and inconsistent pacing, ruined character arcs (like Hulk as in IW he was afraid to even show himself but now they sorted everything out... Off screen), and a very predictable story and ending. I'm not even joking when I say that (even though my prediction was slightly different) my prediction to the film was extremely accurate to the films events.To conclude, I watched Infinity War 3 times in cinemas and who knows how many times on Blu-Ray, but I've only seen Endgame once and have no intention of seeing it again anytime soon: I liked it, but was overall disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

I check my watch after what turned out to be 1 hour of Endgame and couldn't believe there was still another 2 hours to go.It's possible I'd hyped it up to myself too much beforehand, but even then, plot points would have annoyed me regardless. I'd say the overall feelings afterwards were: nostalgic, sad (I admit to some tears), happy, ""it was alright""... but ultimately a little disappointing and frustrating.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
