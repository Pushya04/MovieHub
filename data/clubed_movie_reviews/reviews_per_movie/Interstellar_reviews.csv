7 years later,"Sometimes I just need to see the start. Or end. Or a trailer. Or the music and theme from Hans Zimmer. Or the whole movie. Just to feel that thing, I only get from this movie. That the earth, space and time are something special, mystical. I never forget the first time I saw this movie, in an IMAX theatre in 2014. I was struck by it. Totally got me. And it stil does, 7 years later. This is the best movie ever made for me. Because of the feeling it gives me, no other movie can. So hard to get all of this emotion in only one movie.

Out of this world,"A lot has been said and written about Interstellar. You can obviously take apart any movie that is out there. You'll either love this one or you won't. I kind of would have loved to have watched this on an IMAX screen, the sheer scope of the whole thing. It's just amazing, what Nolan has put on screen here. It's not only the visual experience (there is no 3D here by the way), it's the story/ride you take with it. It might be clear to some earlier than to others, where it's heading (no pun intended), but it doesn't change the fact that it's beautiful ... and terrifying at the same time.Going out and saying this will be considered a classic, might not be too far stretched, but you still can never predict those things. The deserved love the movie gets on IMDb and other places would be an indicator that this will ring true though. The acting is really good, but I can understand if some people have issues with the ending. But the movie had to end in one way or another. It's the best possible way this could go, even if it's not in our grasps just yet ...",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Masterpiece,"Amongst the best movies of all time. The story, the acting, the script, the cinematography, the effects, the sound and the production as a whole is all absolute 10/10's.But what beats all of that is Hans Zimmers compositions. How he continues to churn out perfection to the senses is mindblowing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A visual and auditory marvel,"Interstellar is a movie like no other. Unlike many apocalyptic sci-fi films that feature advanced technology as the source of our destruction (ala The Terminator movies), it instead asserts that technology will save us.Not everyone in Interstellar recognizes the potential of advanced technology. Most dismiss it as a waste of time and resources, and not just old curmudgeons feel this way. Thoughtful, intelligent young characters share this sentiment. This belief gained steam following a world-wide blight that wiped out the vast majority of life on earthâ€”crops and humans.Farming became paramount while advanced technology was deemed frivolous. Cooper (McConaughey) remains one of the few survivors who still appreciates the need for engineering. He feels like a man lost in time, until he stumbles into the headquarters of NASA (which had been operating in secret due to public disapproval). Here he meets others who realize that a return to our old ways is unsustainable and will ultimately lead to our demise. We need technology to save us. As Michael Caine, playing the brilliant (duh!) Professor Brand, eloquently tells Cooper, ""we were never meant to save the world. We were meant to leave it."" For a movie that won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects (and deservedly so) the sound stole the show. Hans Zimmer (Dark Knight Trilogy) unleashed a performance that was, quite appropriately, out of this world. Never have I seen a movie elevated so much by its score. The sound literally took my breath away. Forgive me for the next paragraph. I will gush irresponsibly about the magic that is this movie's sound. Skip it if you please. You have your warning.The music fueled every important scene. In every meaningful moment Zimmer's harmonies captivated watchers' attention in the way of a coach commanding a locker room with a pregame speech. The music elucidated those emotional scenes, particularly ones featuring Cooper and his daughter, in a way that no words or visual ques possibly could. I sat frozen, jaw agape, with tears pouring down my cheeks as the music completely overwhelmed my emotions. The sound penetrated my soul and reverberated through my body, flowing to my appendages, supplying me with life like a heartbeat pumping blood through my veins. The music was truly the life force of movie.Yes, we all witnessed a visual triumph, a daring creative wonder the likes of which we haven't encountered since Inception. Yes, nearly every actor's performance proved worthy of commendation. McConaughey is on fire. Chastain is blossoming into a star. At this point Michael Cain exudes such knowledge and wisdom by merely appearing on screen that if he were cast as Albert Einstein, people would wonder if the role were beneath him. All this considered, and the sound still towered over everything.I walked out of the theater believing that I had experienced something unique, something truly special. Interstellar inspires, it awes, and above all it entertains. I cannot ask for more than that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Best movie I have seen in my life,"This movie was the best written, acted, visual effected, etc. movie. This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan and this movie was his finest. Matthew McConaughey turned in his best performance of his lifetime. Anne Hathaway was an amazing supporting actress and compared to her performance in Les Miserables, I have no idea how she didn't get an Oscar for this. The visual effects were more than just Oscar worthy. They were pioneering. I have never seen anything like it. One thing I would recommend is having a little previous knowledge about space. Not like Einstein stuff though. I would recommend you see this movie as fast as you can if you are a Nolan fan or not.

It is what advanced this civilization and it will continue to do so. So never, never let anybody tell you that we shouldn't look towards the stars and wonder, because that's what makes us human.

Excellent Movie,"I judge a movie by how long it takes me to realize I need the bathroom, how long the movie can hold my interest and how convincing the events unfolding are.

Being old enough, and lucky enough to have watched the premiere of 2001 A Space Odyssey - and viewed it several times since - of course I made comparisons, and there were a few, but this movie tells an excellent stand alone story that is both riveting and believable. I'm not going to give away any secrets but anyone who watches the last five minutes or so without a lump in their throat and a tear in their eye, well you're a critic, you're not enjoying the movie because you're too busy looking for bloopers and faults.

A Visually Monumental And Thoughtful Sci-Fi Epic,"I was extremely lucky to get the chance to see this film upon its first day release, before entering the cinema, my expectations were already high, after all, this was a film from the cinematic genius who brought us the likes of 'Inception' and 'The Dark Knight', to summarise the following review in a single sentence: I left the cinema in extreme awe from the visual masterpiece I had just viewed. A film that explores the psychological and emotional state of a man whose life revolves around his family, 'Interstellar' is a thrilling and thought-provoking film that boasts an intellectual story masterfully written by the Nolan brothers. Whilst there seems to have been influence from films like '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Apollo 13', 'Interstellar' is unique in its own way. Whilst the subject may be hard to comprehend at times, it can't be denied how visually monumental and thoughtful Christopher Nolan's epic science fiction masterpiece is, and can easily be named the best film of this year and possibly one of the greatest science fiction films to have ever graced the screen. A sheer brilliant feat of cinema.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Unmatched visuals and writing, yet sentimentalist and most definitely not Nolan's best directorial work","I will keep this short for the sake of not spoiling anything.Right off i should say I love Nolan. I adore most of his movies, and Interstellar is no exception. It is a marvelous piece of work whose visuals will be hard to forget. His shots of space and the way he played with colors is rather masterful. Maybe i expected it to be greater than what i saw, but even though i was moved by the movie i did not quite feel like he created something great with 'Interstellar.' This could be attributed maybe to his overuse of sentimentalism in the father-daughter relationship he creates. Nolan really tries to make you cry with this one. I have never seen him use such powerful emotions in his movies; however that is not necessarily a good thing for this movie, given that he uses his time trying to develop a family relationship at the expense of flow and congruency. Again, the Visuals are completely off the charts. The visual imagery is truly beautiful and something that Nolan has always excelled at. Given that the most visually stunning movie in recent years, Gravity, recently came out, Interstellar does not lag behind and shows you a spectacle of Visual effects.He will most likely win Visual effects at the Oscars. The Hans's score is marvelous and will most likely earn an Oscar nomination. Matthew Mcconaughey's acting is good, but nothing stellar, especially coming off the best acting role of his career. He plays the character like it should be played, but Nolan's characters never being truly drawn out or rounded does not help him any.The same can be said for the rest of the cast. The little girl was marvelous though. I do not want to reveal any piece of the story whatsoever, but i have to say, it is one of the most original scripts i've ever seen.Ultimately this movie is entertaining. There is no way Nolan can miss that. Another great thing that Nolan excels at is INSPIRING. By the time the credits rolled and people walked out, I sat there still in awe at the strong sense of human will the movie conveys. Personally, I don't think this is Nolan's best. I believe Memento stands as his masterpiece. But with Nolan, everyone has their own favorite movie. Maybe for some, Interstellar will be their favorite movie, for it is really Nolan's most ambitious and visually-striking work.By the way, Anyone else who even tries to compare Interstellar to ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is out of their mind. Kubrick's mission was to create art. Nolan in ""Interstellar"" sets to awe and inspire its audiences. It is truly a great piece of work.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Makes three hours feel like a lifetime - awful,"OK, I'll keep this brief, but I'll also nail my credentials to the mast first. I know science, cosmology, sci-fi and film-making pretty well. I have, in the past taught film studies at degree level, and worked on the production of more than one major Hollywood sci-fi film. I read Stephen Baxter and I like space stuff a lot. More than a lot. And why am I telling you this? Because I should have loved ""Interstellar"", but I didn't for one simple reason: It is a truly dreadful piece of film-making.I won't even bother with dissecting the ""science"" in the film, because that isn't really the issue (it is wrong on pretty much every level). I'm not even going to bother complaining about the absurd audio balance in the sound mix. And I'll ignore the sub-standard special effects - because FX don't a great movie make.The issues I have with Interstellar are essentially these: The film is an arse-numbing three hours long, and feels far longer. The pace is stunningly poorly judged - the first hour in particular could have been cut to ten minutes and far more would have been gained than lost.The characters are paper-thin, and I didn't care about any of them. The plot is entirely derivative (mostly of the vastly superior ""Contact""). The special effects aren't special at all and the editing (or lack of) is so self-indulgent it is a text book example of a director so enamoured with his project that he loses objectivity. The result is a plodding, flabby, and desperately dull movie devoid of any real excitement or emotional impact.I won't go on, but special mention must be made of the planets - Paddling World and Coldworld. You see virtually nothing of either, and so utterly uninteresting are they that what should have been a moment of genuine cinematic wonderment was squandered with a bit of poor CGI painfully inferior to ""A Perfect Storm"" and a location less dramatic than your own back garden.I've probably not been a brief as I intended, but as I write this I feel the disappointment and actual anger I felt on leaving the cinema bubbling to the surface again. It was a total let-down and a waste of more than three hours of my life. The gushing reviews on here are ridiculous and absurd, and I am forced to conclude that reviewers either watched a different film to me, or saw something so brilliant it completely passed me by. I am fairly confident I didn't doze off, although I desperately wanted to.So in conclusion, ""Contact"" did all of this far, far better, fifteen years ago. In Contact the characters are human, believable, beautifully realised and you care what happens to them. The relationship between Father and Daughter is deeply moving and inspiring. But then the plot is far more sophisticated anyway, dealing with the social tensions and impact of the discovery of extra-terrestrial life, the science is accurate and entirely plausible (it was written by Carl Sagan after all), the movie is genuinely thrilling and full of spectacle, and it has something very profound to say.Contact is everything Interstellar is not, and it has a considerably shorter running time. Contact brought tears to my eyes, Interstellar bored me to tears.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Glad i didn't watch the trailer,"Interstellar - ReviewCertain things in life are precious. Very precious. And so was the Film for me.Why you might ask?Well seldom do i get the chance where i find myself sitting in a cinema anxious and intrigued by what might come. In a time where trailers are omnipresent and going to the movies without having seen one seems unreasonable, outright stupid to some i had the magical chance to find myself in front of the IMAX on a cold November night with 2 tickets to Interstellar. My only knowledge was that Nolan directed it and McConaughey stars in it.The images were brilliant the acting was top notch and everything was blended together by Hans Zimmer and his Music. 169 minutes flew by me with my eyes fixed on the screen and my heart racing. And there it was.. The ending. I couldn't believe it . I was reliving, rethinking the movie while the credit scenes rolled enjoying the moment, the smell of popcorn, my comfortable seat and what do i see next to me? Ninety percent of the people in the cinema rushing outside after the first second of the credit scenes....Well apparently people enjoy movies different than i do.

Absolutely incredible; truly a must-watch,"It's difficult to put into words how powerful this film is. In fact, I'd go as far to say as this is so much more than just a film. After watching this, you somehow feel as if you've experienced a whole lifetime in a mere 3 hours. There isn't a single moment that goes unwasted; everything is purposeful.This is a sci-fi film in which the 'fi' part enables the film to convery so many powerful messages. It puts just the right amout of focus on science without trying too hard to explain or prove itself. To me, one of the most powerful effects this film has left me with is the concept of impermanence. Our time on this world is finite and we should cherish and embrace it as much as we can. The film also fiddles with the concept of time and uses it as an integral part of the plot. But perhaps the most powerful message of this film is of the human condition. Yes, as humans we have our shortcomings. But we can also show remarkable empathy, dedication and ingenuity.I would be lying if I said I wasn't highly emotional while watching this film. In fact, I found myself breaking into tears several times throughout the film. I know this review wasn't very analytical - I will say the following though: this film is so immersive and well done that you forget you're watching a film. The acting is simply superb and believable at all times. Reviewing this without talking about the audio and the music would be a great disservice. The film is accompanied by one of the most brilliant soundtracks. From a composition perspective, it might seem that there isn't a lot going on in the music. But the power of the soundtrack is in its simplicity and the emotions it manages to evoke.I will end this review by saying that I truly think this film has made me a better person in some sense. It reminded me of how powerful humans can be, and how we should use our finite time on this planet to care and be empathic towards each other and our planet.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Nolan's masterpiece, one of the best sci-fi movie","I have been a cinema lover for years, read a lot of reviews on IMDb and everywhere, and never found the right movie to write my first review. I always thought I would wait for THE movie.And this is IT!When I first heard that Nolan was preparing a sci-fi movie, I felt like a kid again, waiting for his Christmas gift under the tree. I knew it would become a classic. And I'm sure it will.First of all, it is incredibly beautiful to watch. Honestly, it was so beautiful that I felt like I was sucked into the movie. The way Nolan decided to show some scenes really remind me of 2001 A Space Odyssey (actually many things will probably remind you of this movie). We can feel the talent of Christopher Nolan, just by looking at the way it is filmed. The techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way.The sound environment is just mesmerizing. It is a very important part of the movie, because some scenes take place in space, and Noland just found the right way to use sound. The soundtrack (made by the great Hans Zimmer) is breathtaking, epic, amazing, unreal. I could find a lot more adjectives to qualify it, but you have to hear it to understand how epic they are.These two important parts (image and sound) create a stunning atmosphere. You will forget you are in a movie theater, and you will be lost in space, sucked into the adventures of this new Space Odyssey, begging for more. It is a truly unique experience. I can say that I have never felt something like that in a movie theater (at least not for the past ten years).Then, of course, the cast. First of all, Matthew McConaughey. I discovered this actor in Tropic Thunder, but he didn't really convince me, though he was quite funny. Then I saw Dallas Buyers Club. Since that movie, I love him. In this movie... Well, he is the movie. I exaggerate a bit, since there are other great actors (some even unexpected with a special guest) who play extremely well. But he is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story (which is very important in Interstellar). He is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story, as a father, as a human. Anne Hathaway was very convincing, all together the actors managed to create some harmony, which makes the human interactions credible. Caine, Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. And then there is... The special guest, I will call him ""X"". His role, which could be seen as a minor role, is actually much more important than that. He proves, once again, that he is a great actor. Watch and see.And finally, the scenario/story. I won't spoil anything here; I'll just try to convince you how great it is. Nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. With Interstellar he's revolutionizing the sci-fi genre in cinema. From what I heard, he worked with a physicist (in gravitational physics and astrophysics) to help him with that movie. And we can feel and see it. During the fifties, Asimov laid the foundations of modern science fiction. Lucas and Kubrick did the same in cinema. Today, Nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema, proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done (brace yourselves my friends, we have not seen anything yet).Why? Well, simply because we only know a few things about space, some things can't be proved for the moment, so we can use theory, and make the best of it. That is exactly what Nolan did. He used theories that exist today, and made a movie about mankind, about pioneers, about humanity, about us.Because, in spite of all the sci-fi aspect, it is a story about humanity. McConaughey, Hathaway, and mainly ""X"", will managed to convince you about that.My rating for this movie can only be a 10, because in itself, it is a beginning for a new kind of cinema. It IS a classic. Those who say ""we can't compare this movie to 2001 Space Odyssey, nor can we compare Nolan to Kubrick"" are wrong. We can, and we should. Talented people don't live only in the past, some genius live today, among us. And Nolan is one of them. Many say that he is overrated. I truly don't think so. Only time will answer that.This is the sci-fi movie of the decade, and probably the best movie Nolan ever made. Just go for it, without a second thought.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
It's 2025 and I'm here sobbing after re-watching this masterpiece,"I think of movies as an art form that evokes emotions in us, homo sapiens. Interstellar is one of those rare pieces of art that stirs the deepest, unexplainable feelings about what it means to be alive-aware of our temporary existence yet capable of imagining beyond time, into the infinite. Its exploration of love, sacrifice, and the unknown feels profoundly human, connecting us to something greater. The visuals are breathtaking, the score is hauntingly beautiful, and the story resonates on an emotional and philosophical level.

"Entertaining nonsense, but no masterpiece","""Interstellar"" pretends to be more intelligent than Alfonso CuarÃ³n's audio-visual roller coaster, ""Gravity"", but ironically its best moments are those which, like Gravity, rely purely on thrill and spectacle.For the rest of the film we are crammed into a tiny shuttle with McConaughey and his crew, or back on earth with the desperate remnants of human civilization as they attempt to solve the problem of starvation. Most of the dialogue consists of reams and reams of contrived quantum-physics babble, which, if you're like me, will whoosh straight over your head like those exposition sequences in CSI, with brief moments of levity provided by the two -weirdly cubic looking- robots TARS and CASE.Their journey to find another habitable planet is marred by a sequence of seemingly insurmountable problems that become progressively so ludicrous, it ends up impossible to take them seriously, albeit exciting to watch.We already have to stretch our disbelief past the opening premise that the world is dying because of crop blight, yet they've managed to build robots that have human intelligence and can adapt a variety of shapes to achieve a wide range of tasks. One wonders why humans at this level of technological advancement couldn't have found a solution to curbing this unexplained blight other than blasting off into a foreign galaxy to try and populate a mysterious planet neighboring a black hole.Glaring plot issues aside (and there are many), the film is at its best when in full space simulator mode and the audience is being catapulted into the roaring white light of a black hole, accompanied by Hans Zimmer's electrifying score (props to Zimmer for once NOT composing something that sounded exactly like Pirates of The Caribbean), making full use of the IMAX experience.Performances are fairly solid, in particular Jessica Chastain as the grown up Murph, and there is enough raw emotion on show to push some of the more logically questionable moments past your cynic meter and give a sense of weight and importance to what is happening, even if you can't quite understand it.Definitely worth watching on the big screen, but would I give it a 9/10? No way. This is a film that you will enjoy on face value, but once you leave the cinema you will start picking it to shreds. There are just too many inconsistencies, contrivances and blatant stupidity in the plot to call this a masterpiece, but I'd give it a solid 7 for blockbuster entertainment value.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Interstellar : An open-hearted & mastered Human Odyssey,"The film begins by establishing at his own rhythm its ambitions: men overexploited land resources, which is why the only goal they have left is to survive. This life is not enough for Cooper, brilliantly played by McConaughey who gave body and soul to this character. But all of this wouldn't hold without the total control of Christopher Nolan, based on the languishing soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, the luminous and impenetrable photography of Hoyte Van Hoytema, and the sincerity of Nolan's directing. He manages to film the characters and to find the right cut at the right time, always in harmony with Hans Zimmer's soundtrack, to give the film an aspiring and inspiring dimension that went missing for many many years. Thus we are transported into the same cockpit that Cooper, we feel the same remorse that he can already feel, we feel the same gravity, and we feel the same fear of the unknown melted with the force of his will. All of this is brilliantly illustrated in a very simple directing choice, which from my point of view is the decisive impetus of the film: to directly jump from when Cooper leaves in his truck, leaving his family behind him, to Endurance taking off. This simple editing decision allows Nolan to give an original movement to his film, and the musical crescendo makes us physically feel the sentimental break between two parts of the film.You don't necessarily have to understand it immediately : The film will raise questions in you, such as : what is it to be a human being, is there some physical limitations to our humanity, how far could we be willing to go to determine knowledge, is there other dimensions that we can not access to, and above all: what is the nature of this intact and immutable bond that unites us to others wherever we are in the universe ? Is this bond only intelligible, or is it also tangible ? All these questions resonate in harmony in Nolan's Interstellar.Interstellar is itself a crescendo, increasing sensitivity and creativity. I use the term deliberately because it goes crescendo with the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, which is one of the most beautiful music ever scored for a sci-fi movie. We are witnessing a perfect musical arrangement, a total symbiosis, a bit like the music of Gravity which had understood very well how to match the image and the rhythm of a sequence to its own musicality. Zimmer's crescendos are giving a new powerful breath to every new scene, whether it is in visually powerful & intense moments or in more intimate moments; it intrudes into our momentary feelings and sensations, and manages to extend them, sometimes almost to choking, before resting on the balance of the film frame along with our mind spell-bounded.I have seen all the talent of the director that I knew he was outside the norm, but whom I did not know his capacity to reinvent itself. Because this is it: Interstellar is not an action movie, not really a blockbuster, and it goes not entirely but mostly again the expectations of common people. It's much more than that. This is much more than just a sci-fi movie. It is unlike any of his previous films. Some hoped to see Interstellar as Christopher Nolan's best film, and they were disappointed that this was not the case. And indeed, THIS IS NOT THE BEST FILM of Christopher Nolan. Because in a way, IT IS HIS FIRST FILM. I'm not saying that Interstellar is not as good as his other films, it goes beyond all of them. But to me Interstellar is the first film of a new stage in Nolan's filmography ; it is a masterpiece as it the beginning of a work ahead. Interstellar is the proof that Nolan has finally managed, despite all the expectations that were placed on him after the success of The Dark Knight, to move away from his own reputation to create a personal work, original, humble, sincere and deeply, meticulously, measured.Now, in this third act of the film, it all comes to life with unparalleled strength. Nolan poses and answers questions that raise others. But he focuses his attention on the great mystery of love, that emotional bond that can unite men and sometimes separate them. But Nolan is the only one that can successfully speak of love from a being to another in a film that mainly takes place in a another galaxy. From my point of view, only Solaris by Steven Soderbergh (2002), unfortunately neglected by the audience, was able to accomplish that. Interstellar is based on a premise which is the following : from terrestrial dust to the depths of space and time, we can never be separated from who we are as individuals and as a species, as we always leave a part of ourselves ""behind"" us. In other words, I could say that this is a human story, and even if we go as far as we want to, if we travel through the universe believing that we can be detached of the one we are fond of, we will only get closer to them. Because the separation, and thus the distance and time, can only ultimately reinforce the relationship between the people who really love each other. Because it is going to the end of the world, when we reach the end of ourselves, that we reach the singularity of the ""black hole beyond the horizon"" * : it is our humanity. No, I wasn't been able to find any bad flaws in the film. Not one, and I'm still looking. After all, Interstellar is like gravity, ""all it takes is a little push !

Then, when we get to the Oscars, the film gets nominations in the technical fields but not in the top honors.This was wrong. Maybe this is not the best role from Matthew McConaughey or Anne Hathaway.

"An Emotional, Beautiful Journey into the Unknown","(This is both a review of the film, and an assertion of Christopher Nolan's filmmaking style)There have been many reviewers and critics alike that have high praise for the film (the visual effects, the acting, the music), but say how it's not Christopher Nolan's best directed film. This is where i personally would have to disagree. Before i get into it, though, i'll talk about Interstellar a bit.Interstellar is truly a sci-fi epic like no other. To compare said film to '2001: A Space Odyssey' isn't just a disservice, but unnecessary. The films are almost nothing alike, simply sharing small plot elements. Also, Stanley Kubrick's vision of Arthur C. Clarke's sci-fi epic wasn't to ponder the philosophical questions that accompanied the story, but to make art, and art is was, and is. With Interstellar, Mr. Nolan set out to make his most personal and emotional film to date about love and time (time being a recurring theme throughout all of Nolan's films). But it's so much more than that too. There are no words to express the epic journey Nolan takes us on in the film, but needless to say, it's tear-jerking and emotional throughout. The acting is top-notch, especially McConaughey, who gives (I would say) his most emotional performance yet. But the actor who stole the show in a few scenes (one in particular, when they're on an alien planet) was David Gyasi as Romilly, one of the astronauts aboard the Endurance, their spacecraft. The musical score from Hans Zimmer is, without a doubt, his best and most influential work to date, helping drive the film's bold and breath-taking vision (the church organ helped significantly). The visual effects are easily the best to date as well, and of the year. To see a black hole created through visual effects in such a way, with pages theoretical equations provided by Kip Thorne (theoretical physicist, of whom's work inspired the film's genesis); what you see in the film is the most realistic depiction of a black hole, and even offered new insight to accretion discs surrounding the anomalies. But even everything else, from the alien planets to the Endurance, the visuals always look real. Then, there's the writing. I would definitely have to say this has some of the best dialogue i've ever heard in a sci-fi movie, and the script continually pours or oozes emotion, keeping the audience tethered to the film.Now, about Mr. Nolan. Don't just look at Nolan, but look at his films. Some say Inception would be his masterpiece, while others would say it's The Dark Knight, or Memento. But honestly, every single film Christopher Nolan has directed is a masterpiece not of its genre, but of Nolan. Following is his quiet masterpiece, not the film that put Mr. Nolan on the map as a phenomenal director, but one people visited or revisited after becoming accustomed to Nolan, after seeing Memento, what could be called his breakout masterpiece. Then, right after, he directed the remake of the Norwegian thriller, Insomnia. This, too, could be considered a masterpiece, even if a remake. Then, we were given his take on the Batman universe, starting with Batman Begins, the origin masterpiece. Then, there's The Prestige, adapted from the novel of the same name, which can be called his dark masterpiece. The Dark Knight, his bold masterpiece; Inception, his complex masterpiece, and The Dark Knight Rises, his flawed masterpiece. Now, we have Interstellar, his emotional or personal masterpiece.This is just my looking at Nolan and his films, but whatever your thoughts are, you can't deny Interstellar is one hell of a journey. He certainly is one of the best filmmakers of our time, and of all time. I can't wait to see what he does next, but i'm not sure it will be as emotionally powerful as Interstellar.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Sound issues,"I understand Mr. Nolan purposely made the dialogue in Interstellar indistinct to achieve some artistic goal. Unfortunately, I, being almost completely deaf, could not understand enough dialogue to even guess what was going on. I can usually get by without close captioning, but in this case, it was impossible. If I had known this going in, I would have opted for a theater with close captioning . . . whoops, this wasn't digital. Sarcasm aside, I guess Mr. Nolan did not think about how his decisions impacted the hearing impaired. I did not vote because it would not be fair to judge the book solely by its cover. I need to see the movie again with closed captioning before I can vote. I hope I didn't spoil this for anyone. Mr Nolan sure spoiled it for me.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Good, but Overrated","This is a movie with plenty of things going for it. Great performances, incredible visual effects, an interesting story, and tons of really cool concepts, which make for a few genuinely powerful scenes, However, that doesn't make it the flawless masterpiece of cinematic genius everybody is labeling it as. There are tons of people giving this movie 10/10 ratings, leading to a user rating of 8.7, and it is now #29 on the IMDb top 250. WOW! That is a lot of praise! On the top 250, ""Interstellar"" is above ""Casablanca"", ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", ""Psycho"", ""Apocalypse Now"", and ""CITIZEN KANE""! According to the users on IMDb, this movie's better than ""Citizen Kane"", which has been known as possibly the greatest film of all time!Is is better than ""Citizen Kane""? No, not even close. The film is full of flaws, the biggest being the runtime. I may never see this movie again because of how long it felt! It feels like a lot of scenes are unneeded, and were made just so the movie could be longer, because Christopher Nolan wanted to make it seem really epic. I'm sure if Nolan cut a huge chunk of the movie out, it would've been better. A film by Nolan that is better than this one is ""The Dark Knight"", which has a somewhat long runtime, but it feels way shorter than it's runtime, and is extremely entertaining throughout. ""Interstellar"" is so long that it starts to really drag on and, at times, I began to just zone out.The film is also a bit too dramatic. The dialogue about how ""love conquers all"" seemed very unnecessarily corny, as well as a few other select scenes in the movie. However, some sequences were quite powerful, especially the ending, which, actually, was kind of creepy. The concept of time was very prominent throughout the film, and it lead to some pretty creative and powerful sequences.Overall, the film is recommended, but you should be warned that this movie was LOOOOOOOONG!!!!!!",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
'Interstellar',"'Interstellar' was incredible. The visuals, the score, the acting, were all amazing. The plot is definitely one of the most original I've seen in a while. Most of the critic reviews have said that some bits are a little too unbelievable, but I have to disagree. Yes, there were some parts that were definitely in the ""fi"" part of sci-fi. But the thing is, 'Interstellar' deals with concepts that we know very little about. We have no idea what the 4th or 5th dimension is like, or what it would be like to go through a wormhole or a black hole. I don't think it's fair to call something unbelievable, when we have absolutely no idea what WOULD be believable in those circumstances. Either way, excellent writing from the Nolan brothers. The visuals were outstanding, and will no doubt be nominated for an Oscar. The performances were excellent, though nothing Oscar worthy, as is the case with most of Nolan's films ('The Dark Knight' being the obvious exception). Hans Zimmer's score was amazing and blended perfectly with the film. All in all, 'Interstellar' is an excellent movie, which I personally think is Nolan's most beautiful film to date.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Breathtaking Cinematic Masterpiece,"It's difficult to put into words how breathtaking and epic this movie is. It is the greatest film I have ever seen. The blending of a close, intimate father daughter relationship with a larger than life space expedition to save humanity is executed brilliantly by Nolan and crew. The visual effects, story line, writing, acting, and scientific accuracy were all perfect in my eyes, but it's the sheer emotion of the film that gets you. Multiple scenes will have you wiping your eyes as Nolan's manipulation of time in this movie does a brilliant job of evoking never before felt emotions in the viewer.

A Love Story Against The Backdrop Of A Grand Interstellar Travel,"Love is the one thing that transcends time and space...New creation of Christopher Nolan's genius, whose name is now known to everyone. His films are waiting with a special look, because it offers something that every day, unfortunately, less and less can be found in the world of mass cinema - an interesting spectacle, filled with meaning, ideas and emotions. At this time, Christopher decided to send us not to the world of dreams, and even not on the dark streets of Gotham City. No, now he send us to the journey to, and perhaps beyond the boundaries of the possible and impossible, through the curvature of space and time, in other worlds. And you won't forget this trip, this can be assured.I was madly waiting for Interstellar's release. And then, finally, I was able to see this Beauty - at the premiere in my coutry on October, 29. It was incredibly exciting. It was a delight. It was unforgettable. It was gorgeous. Nolan once again amazes the viewer's imagination by his painting. Journey to the brink of infinity, the line where humanity has never set, acts as either the first-born purpose and a background of emotional history about the father and the daughter. A loving father who mankind need to help, but that he should leave his children, and a loving daughter who doesn't want to let her dad in the infinity darkness.Starting from the very first frame and ending with the closing credits, a new picture of Nolan will absorb you completely, forcing stare at the screen during the whole action, because it's all so exciting and interesting that escape becomes physically impossible. No, this three hours won't fly quickly for you. You'll feel every emotion, every event, every character. You will not look how the main characters travel through the universe, because the movie experience in this film is so excellent that you will be on board of ""Endurance"" starship and travel between the worlds with the main characters by yourself.The emotional core of this story is the relationship of Matthew McConaughey's character and his daughter - Mackenzie Foy' and Jessica Chastain' character. And the acting work of these three artists in ""Interstellar"" impress the most. McConaughey was acting really great, and this is one of the most emotional, if not the most emotional role of his life. All the drama and tragedy of the relationship of father and daughter in this film will not leave anyone indifferent. Anne Hathaway, Wes Bentley, Michael Caine, Casey Affleck, Ellen Burstyn and other actors also coped with their roles and presented the film's supporting characters very realistic. I would particularly like to note a small but important in this story role of Matt Damon, a character who has received quite memorable. If we talk about the characters, it should be noted also two robots that accompanied our heroes in this difficult journey. One of them adds a touch of humor in the film, which mitigates constantly depressing, dramatic, and sometimes really dark atmosphere.The script of the film is very well combined the history of space exploration and the relationship between Cooper and Murph. The story is complex and complicated, is based on real scientific theories by Kip Thorne, and indeed contains a reference to the ""Space Odyssey"" and other sci-fi pictures. This story about true love, about loyalty, forgiveness, fraud, hard decisions, and much more. And it is designed so that leaves a lot of room for the imagination of the viewer. It's also possible to notice some structure allusion to another Nolan's work - Inception. The story and visuals are combined just perfectly in Interstellar.Hans Zimmer's score, written by him on the basis of only one letter from Nolan, hold the key: ""Once we become parents, we can't help but look at ourselves through the eyes of our children"", deserves a special praise. On this basis, Hans managed to write just incredible soundtrack that perfectly harmonizes with the history and the visual side of the picture. And this work of the composer is really different from the previous ones. It is executed in a different style from another subject in its base. Very impressive work, which will be pleasantly listened again and separate from the film itself.Visual range of the picture is incredibly beautiful and circuses. The ""Endurance"" itself, new worlds, insanely beautiful and mysterious space, wormholes, black holes, and travel through them, folds of time and space are arranged so that is simply breathtaking. I would like to thank all those who contributed to the creation of a visual of this film. It must be seen. That mastery with which this is done, not just words. In the visual pattern also has some references to the Kubrick's ""Odyssey"", and they are pleasing to the eye.Many thanks to Christopher Nolan for having given us such an incredible movie, which once again proved to us that the cinema is Nolan's life.""Interstellar"" is a film that wins the hearts of the audience not only with its sci-fi splendor, but also an emotional story that lies at its very heart. This film is not only about the discoveries, space exploration and the final frontier of mankind, but also about the relationship of father and daughter, who were in a difficult situation in life when one has to leave the other in the name of a goal that can not be underestimated. So, with what Nolan's genius unfolds before us this action is beyond praise. Combining the story, filled with not only real science fiction, but the true human values â€‹â€‹and emotions, outstanding and very emotional performances, breathtaking visuals, epic and dramatic soundtrack, Christopher Nolan breathed the life into this film by his directing to create something truly masterpiece again.""Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night...

Emotionally captivating and intellectually challenging,"This film tells the story of an ex-pilot in a world full of dust storms. He is chosen to travel to the uncharted parts of the space in search for a new habitable planet.""Interstellar"" is a long film, and the first two hours of it does not seem like a typical Christopher Nolan film. Most of the scenes are (literally) down to Earth, with no fancy visual effects. It spends much time building up the story, telling the story of a father and his daughter who sees 'ghost' in her bedroom. Through this ghost, one thing led to another, and the man is in space. When the film is not down on Earth, it looks more like a disaster film. The first adventure is a spectacular feat involving water. It also introduces the physics of relativity, on how time slows down in another world, leading to a misguided decision of the astronauts in retrospect. This sets the foundation for future plot involving more relativity.As the film progresses, there is more adventure, both in the form of adrenaline pumping adventure and humanity and integrity testing conditions. Matt Damon's character forms a central subplot that makes me reflect on what lengths would people go in order to achieve a certain goal. It reflects on the reality that people are driven by egocentric instincts. It is not a pretty truth, but it tells that human are not idealistic creatures.The final half an hour is what a typical Christopher Nolan film is like. It makes me hold my breath because it is so intense, both emotionally and cognitively. The ending gives me inexplicable exhilaration. Things come to a full circle, and it is filled with joy.It is not a film for everyone, as the story is long and takes a lot of time to build. Two people walked out of the cinema an hour into the film, and someone sitting behind me remarked after the film ended that he opined it was the most boring Christopher Nolan film ever. For me, I enjoyed ""Interstellar"" thoroughly, because it is emotionally captivating and intellectually challenging.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

An amazing Drama with Sci-Fi elements.,"The key of this movie may feel like you're watching only a Science-Fiction movie. Most of the times Sci-Fi movies are not great at telling an effective, emotional drama stories. You can't find this type of movie easily, unless you are watching a Sci-Fi movie directed by Christopher Nolan and written by Jonathan Nolan.Mixing those two genres is unique and dangerous. All the Nolan's projects are a bit dangerous and special.Not only the storyline is so great but also nearly all other technical details are great!Brilliant scores that composed by Hans Zimmer.The film editing is just beyond perfect. One of the best film editings of all time.The Cinematography by Wally Pfister is quite realistic and charming.The VFX are just stunning. Even the scientist are amazed by how great it is.Some of the people thinks this movie is based on wrong theories, so that makes it a bad movie. As you may know, all the movies are based on wrong things. You are watching a Sci-Fi movie. In being realistic, Sci-Fi movies are just one step ahead of Fantasy. Why would you look for reality in this movies? It's not a crime movie. If people would demand realistic movies, there would be a bigger Documentary sector.The main reason why people think like that is this movie is not only based on wrong theories. It's mixed. Some of the theories are proven, some of them has potential to be true, some of them are not likely true.But you can't make a movie that reflects so effective storyline with only the truth. Even ""Based on A True Story"" movies are so changed to make it more effective. You can't name any Sci-Fi movie that based on all true theories. Other Sci-Fi movies are not explaining the questions at all. And somehow when this movie tries to explain, this movie becames faulty. So better not trying to explain what's going on? In this movie there is no major flaw that you can't ignore. The main story is just so effective and perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Some interesting ideas, but overall unsatisfying","I have to begin this review by acknowledging that I saw this movie under less than optimal conditions - on the screen on the back of a Jet Blue seat. Whatever visual magic might have impressed me was grainy and small, and the sound was murky. There's a good chance I would have liked this film better if seen properly.That being said, I probably wouldn't have liked it a *lot* better, because the things I didn't like would have been the same.First off, I thought the movie was off to a real slow start. It was basically a dust bowl family saga, and while I'll admit you needed some context for what happens later, it felt like it went on much too long.The early space experience also didn't engage me that much. Part of the problem might just be my expectations for a Christopher Nolan movie. I knew almost nothing about this film going in, but I think of Nolan as the director of Inception and Memento, and Interstellar was just so darn straightforward (at least at first).Eventually (the movie is almost three hours, so it really takes its time) the film's more intriguing ideas appear, such as the trickiness of relative time. The movie also becomes more eventful. Yet still there were things I found offputting; the first death in the movie makes no sense; it shouldn't have happened, and realistically wouldn't have. (Later I read a critique that pointed out that the whole scene wouldn't have happened that way unless everyone involved was an idiot.)The movie did, become more engrossing as it got more involved, playing with its time concept and tossed in some interesting twists and suspenseful moments.Alas, whatever gains the movie had made in my heart were squandered in the end. Apparently the movie had a scientist to make sure the science was good, and perhaps it was, yet to me the final part seemed incredibly silly, with way too much leaning on non-science things like intuition. And the last scenes were just .... huh? (Although someone in the IMDb board came up with a very Christopher Nolan interpretation of the end that I found more appealing.)As I say, if I'd seen it on the big screen I might have been more forgiving of its flaws, and it's very possible things like the reportedly hardcore seriousness with which it approached getting the look of a black hole just right would have made its length and plot weaknesses more palatable. But even saying that, I cannot see any way this movie would ever impress me as much as it has others.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"A familiar journey to the unknown, albeit a grand one","So last night I got the chance to see the early screening of Christopher Nolan's Interstellar. The film I've been waiting so much from the early days of the shooting. How did it fare? Here's my take:To avoid any tl;dr risk, let me get this straight from the very beginning, Interstellar is one goddamnedly good film, it gets you to the edge of your seat, it soars, it warps, it rips your brain senseless. It's that good.Interstellar is a story about the earth dying, with its soil no longer able to sustain crops other than corn, and of course, it will lead to the extinction of humanity. Our hero is an ex-NASA test pilot named Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a typical ordinary-guy-in-an-extraordinary- situation everyman who's also a dedicated family man, especially toward his daughter Murphy (named after the Murphy's Law). In an all-too-Armageddon style our hero gets invited by the (publicly) defunct NASA to become humanity's last hope in finding a new home, for they have found a wormhole near Saturn (2001, anyone?) which will warp the astronauts to another galaxy in quest of a habitable planet. Solid and compact premise, although it's been used before.For seasoned filmgoers, there are many similar elements (although it's understandable) with Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Robert Zemeckis' Contact (1997). In a sense that this is not a bang-bang-shoot-shoot-blow-em-up sci-fi, but more of a slow-burning, metaphysical sci-fi which gets you to think about your place in the universe and your exact place in time.Similarity with 2001 and Contact is never a bad thing, but it becomes a wee bit too predictable, although Nolan is a smart enough director in providing the final (a very sentimental one, I should say) twist in the story. The visuals in this film is majestic, everything is shot to a meticulously calculated level, Nolan-style. The space scenes are serenely suspenseful just like Cuaron's Gravity, but unlike the documentary feel of Gravity, there's a real gusto and pace to these scenes. You should also be prepared for the (for some, maybe) unexpected third act, it is Nolan's most sentimental and humane moment to date. And this is why Interstellar is more than just a science-fiction, it is a human drama intertwined in space and time loop.One thing that Nolan gets a bit wrong is the narrative. Nolan was never a 'warm' director, his films are filled with brilliant ideas and flair but it feels cold, it maybe suits Memento and The Dark Knight but in Interstellar he seems to have been lost in determining which of the interpersonal drama or the sci-fi that will be Interstellar's forte. The result is a rather incongruous script, intermittently cutting off the excitement of the previous scene and so on. But it is a forgivable sin, for the good is a lot more than the bad in this monumental film. At the end of the day, all I can say is that Interstellar is a grand film. It is monolithic, thoughtful, sentimental, sophisticated, visceral but also with its flaws. I wouldn't say it's Nolan's best work to date, but I daresay that this is one of the best science fiction ever released.After watching Interstellar, do yourself a favor and get lost in space and time and go back in time to see Contact (1997) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) to further wonder and wander into the realms of the unknown.Because sometimes it is the unknown that fascinates us, frightens us and brings out the best in us.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Epic in every way!,"Just watched Interstellar in imax 70mm. Science Fiction fans can read on, everyone else can skip. Movie is a visual masterpiece.

Do not go into the theatre expecting an action packed cerebral thriller. This one is not for action fans. At times, movie go highly sentimental( Matthew McConaughey does what he is best in and supposed to). I recommend this movie to all the Sci-Fi fans out there, make sure you go in group of sci-fi nuts!! Do not go with the hype..Go, sit back and enjoy. Just like Inception, this movie will be known as great after few months(I know people who said Inception was a crap when it released, and after few months rating it 10/10 in IMDb :D).

Best Si-Fi movie,"Interstellar (2014) - A Cinematic Masterpiece of Science and EmotionChristopher Nolan's Interstellar (2014) is a breathtaking sci-fi epic that seamlessly blends hard science with deep human emotions. The film, starring Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, and Michael Caine, explores themes of time, space, love, and survival, making it one of the most thought-provoking films of the 21st century. With stunning visuals, a gripping narrative, and Hans Zimmer's unforgettable score, Interstellar is more than just a movie-it is an experience that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll.Plot OverviewSet in a dystopian future where Earth is facing environmental collapse, Interstellar follows the journey of Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former NASA pilot turned farmer, who is struggling to provide for his two children, Murph and Tom. With crops failing and dust storms becoming more frequent, humanity faces extinction. When Cooper stumbles upon a secret NASA base led by Dr. Brand (Michael Caine), he is presented with a dangerous but crucial mission: to travel through a mysterious wormhole near Saturn in search of habitable planets for humanity's survival.Cooper reluctantly leaves his children behind, particularly his daughter Murph, with whom he shares a deep bond. He joins a team of astronauts-including Dr. Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway), Romilly (David Gyasi), Doyle (Wes Bentley), and the AI robot TARS-on the spacecraft Endurance. Their journey takes them to distant worlds, each presenting unique challenges and dangers.Themes and SymbolismOne of the most powerful aspects of Interstellar is its exploration of time and relativity. The crew's visit to a planet orbiting a supermassive black hole, Gargantua, results in a severe time dilation-one hour on the planet equals seven years on Earth. When Cooper and Brand return to their ship, they discover that over two decades have passed. This heartbreaking reality is reinforced when Cooper watches video messages from his now-adult children, highlighting the painful consequences of his sacrifice.The film also delves into the concept of love as a force beyond time and space. Dr. Brand passionately argues that love transcends dimensions, and this is symbolized through Cooper's bond with Murph. Despite being separated by light-years, their connection remains intact, ultimately playing a pivotal role in the film's climax.Science and RealismNolan collaborated with theoretical physicist Kip Thorne to ensure scientific accuracy, making Interstellar one of the most scientifically grounded sci-fi films. The depiction of black holes, wormholes, and time dilation is based on real physics, and Gargantua's visualization is considered one of the most accurate representations of a black hole in cinematic history. The movie successfully balances scientific realism with artistic liberty, making complex theories accessible to the audience without compromising the emotional depth of the story.Performances and Emotional ImpactMatthew McConaughey delivers one of his finest performances as Cooper. His portrayal of a father torn between duty and love is deeply moving, particularly in the scene where he breaks down while watching messages from his grown-up children. Jessica Chastain as the adult Murph adds intensity to the film, showcasing a daughter's unresolved pain and determination to complete her father's mission. Anne Hathaway brings depth to her role as Brand, especially in her speech about love's power as an unexplored scientific force.Michael Caine's performance as Dr. Brand is equally compelling, particularly when he recites Dylan Thomas's poem Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night, which becomes an emotional refrain throughout the film. Even supporting characters, including the AI robots TARS and CASE, add humor and warmth to an otherwise intense narrative.Hans Zimmer's ScoreOne of the most unforgettable elements of Interstellar is Hans Zimmer's musical score. Using a church organ to create a haunting yet majestic soundscape, Zimmer's music enhances the film's emotional weight. Tracks like Cornfield Chase, Stay, and No Time for Caution perfectly accompany key moments, making the audience feel the vastness of space and the urgency of time.Cinematic ExcellenceVisually, Interstellar is a masterpiece. The vastness of space, the eerie silence of distant planets, and the mesmerizing beauty of the black hole Gargantua are captured with breathtaking detail. Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography and Nolan's practical effects give the film a sense of realism that CGI-heavy sci-fi movies often lack. The use of IMAX cameras enhances the immersion, making Interstellar a must-watch on the biggest screen possible.ConclusionInterstellar is not just a sci-fi movie; it is an emotional journey that explores what it means to be human. With its brilliant performances, scientific depth, stunning visuals, and a heart-wrenching story, it remains one of the greatest films of all time. Whether you are a fan of space exploration, physics, or simply great storytelling, Interstellar offers a cinematic experience that is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally profound.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Matthew McConaughey explains the origin of his daughter's name. To his daughter's face.,"Science fiction fans don't need everything spelling out for them. That's why the narration was removed from Blade Runner. That's why 2001: A Space Odyssey has no dialogue in its opening and closing twenty minutes. That's why R2D2 doesn't speak English.There's a scene in Interstellar in which Matthew McConaughey explains the origin of his daughter's name. To his daughter's face. This blunt method of explaining Murphy's Law to the audience is just one example of the unnecessary exposition which Interstellar's running time is so bloated by. It is also the first of many inferior echoes of Contact. In Contact, James Woods explains Occam's Razor in a similar fashion, however it is justified by the court of law context in which the scene takes place.More significantly however is the lifting of a major theme from Contact in which Jodie Foster never fully moves on from the loss of her father. Jessica Chastain's character here does likewise, only without the emotional resonance because she is so bitter that it's hard to sympathise with her. The other female character in 'Interstellar' (yeah there's only two) also spends all her screen time pining after a man. Feminists - stay away!Another silly moment is the shot for shot homage to Event Horizon. This is when one scientist explains to another scientist what a wormhole is. Which is like a driving instructor explaining to another driving instructor what biting point is. It wouldn't happen, like, ever. At least when Sam Neil gave the low down on wormholes in Event Horizon he was addressing blue collar workers so it was, once again, justified by context.Perhaps the goofiest thing in the whole film is TARS, a computer with delusions of being the next HAL 9000, which is actually nothing more than metallic origami. Have I mentioned it knows a joke? Yeah it has been programmed with one joke and it uses this joke many times. The joke is that humour is quantifiable by percentage.Why watch this when you can watch Contact, 2001: A Space Odyssey or Silent Running? Why go for Christopher Nolan's take on Dust Bowl migration when you can read John Steinbeck's instead?On a positive note there are some cool graphics to look at. You know, like the cool graphics in The Hobbit or Transformers.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Pretty Pictures do not make up for the lack of story,"You would think the story is adventurous, exciting, beautiful! Its not at all what I had hoped. It is slow, dark as a black hole, loud as an old Barton Theater Organ playing Fugue in D Minor interesting as a litter box.The story is thin.....I can't blame the actors, the entire plot is pretty simple. Can't inhabit earth, find somewhere else to live. Interstellar is a repeat of time continuum stories you have heard or seen before, I wont spoil it, but it's all been told before.Dialog is dreary, slow, ponderous. The comparison to 2001 is preposterous. The wonder and awe of 2001 and other movies before it was it had never been done it was the first. 2001 was all done without the advanced technology we have in computer imagery we have today. 2001 was a pioneering effort. This is not at all pioneering, inventive or surprising if you read science fiction at all.The imagery is not all that unique or impressive. The constant thumping and droning of background music was mind numbing. Most of the show I was trying to nod off, but for the LOUD THEATER ORGAN playing in the background I probably would have.I have to agree with some of the reviewers who thought the whole show was ridiculous and in some ways they are right. Somehow science has advanced enough to create interstellar space travel but not far enough to build power cells, clean power, they are still burning fossil fuels. The robots are Lego like, silly looking clunks of stainless steel....it is all so ridiculous.I would not call this HORRIBLE or AWFUL I have seen some real stinkers over the years.

The GENIUS shocks the world by another unique innovation..!!,"(((WOW)))...!!!It's almost impossible to put in words, but we have to try and give everyone what he truly deserve.In my modest opinion, Interstellar is the best Sci-Fi in human history. Believe it or not. It's the simple and the complicated, It's the usual and the different, It's the mind and the heart, It's an emotional and psychological journey through the unknown which has its own stunning visuals. It's an original story and thought-provoking masterpiece.Every single time with him, you just got crazy about his ideas, astonished by his mind games and inspired when he talks to the heart.Back then, he was an ambitious young director. And with his capabilities made his own way straight through the world. Now, he is an icon and a legend of directing. He is Christopher Nolan...Really guys, what's wrong with this guy ?!! what's going on inside his head ?!!It's our job to honor the honorable. Please, Just keep the rating UP, why ? Because Chris. and Interstellar deserve it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Going brilliantly (but very LOUDLY) into the dark,"Wowser! This Christopher Nolan film was presaged with such marketing hype that I went in with pretty low and cynical expectations. But I was frankly blown away with it.Just about everyone raves about Christopher Nolan's work, and you look back at his Filmography and it makes for a pretty impressive resume: from Memento via the (rather over-hyped imho) Dark Knight Batman series-reboot through to Inception, one of my favourite films of all time. For me, Interstellar is right up there with Inception for thought-provoking, visually spectacular and truly epic cinema.We start in familiar 'Day after Tomorrow"" territory, with mankind having in some way â€“ not entirely explained â€“ messed up the planet. As I understood it (and the film probably does require multiple watches with â€“ see comments below â€“ subtitles=on) the rather clever premise is that the world's food supplies are being progressively destroyed by a vindictive 'blight'. This delivers the double whammy of destroying mankind's provisions but also, by massive reproduction of the organism, progressively depleting the Earth's oxygen. For some reason â€“ again, which I didn't get on first viewing â€“ this is accompanied by massive dust storms. It is a morbid bet as to what is going to get the mid-West population first: starvation, lung disease or suffocation. Matthew McConnaughey plays the widowed Cooper, an ex-NASA drop out turned farmer given the opportunity by mission-leader Professor Brand (an excellent Michael Caine) to pilot a NASA mission. The goal is to punch through a mysterious wormhole in space where they suspect, through previous work, that a new home for mankind could be found.The first part of the film is set on and around Cooper's farm, setting in place one of the emotional wrenches at the heart of the film: that Cooper in volunteering for the mission and having to leave behind his elderly father (John Lithgow, again superb) and young children Murph (aged 10) and Tom (aged 15) whilst recognising that danger for him comes not just from the inherent risks involved but from the theory of relativity that could change everything, time-wise, for when he returns.Cooper is supported on the mission by a team of scientists including Brand's daughter played by a love-struck Anne Hathaway, who again shows she can act.To say any more would spoil what is a voyage of visual and mental discovery. (However, I would add that it is good to see that the character that plays my namesake Dr Mann (in a surprise cameo) is equally good looking! LOL).In terms of plus points, where do I start? The visuals are utterly stunning. Whilst reminiscent in places of Kubrick's ""stargate"" from 2001, the similarity is only passing. The film adds a majesty and scale to space that surpasses wonder. Elsewhere there are some interesting visual effects: this might have just been me of course, but after the dramatic launch there was something about the camera moves during the first scenes of weightlessness that made me feel genuinely nauseous.Equally stunning is Hans Zimmer's score which is epic and (in places) very VERY loud. The film certainly doesn't ""go quietly into the night""! When matching the noise of the score/choir to the sound effects in the launch sequence the combination is ear-bleedingly effective. This must be a strong contender for the soundtrack Oscar for 2014. One quibble, again 2001 related, is that Zimmer uses the last chord of Also Sprach Zarathustra in the score sufficiently often that one hopes Richard Strauss's estate receives some royalties! The acting is top notch: I've already mentioned Caine and Lithgow, but McConnaughey, Hathaway and Jessica Chastain are all great. A particular shout-out should go to Mackenzie Foy as the young Murph, who is magnetically charismatic and just brilliant in the role.Above all, Nolan's direction is exquisite. The film has a slow build on earth (which adds to the lengthy running time) but defines the characters and primes the plot perfectly. And some of the editing cuts â€“ again, Cooper's farm departure/launch sequence overlay is a great example â€“ are superb in building the mood and the tension.I've decided that I am an extremely tough reviewer and for me a 10 star film is a rarity indeed. Where I could have knocked off a star was in some of the dialogue on the soundtrack, which was pretty inaudible in places: McConnaughey in particular with his general mumbling and strong southern accent is indecipherable in places. I look forward to the DVD subtitles. And one of the character's dying words â€“ delivering a key plot point in the film â€“ was completely lost to me (but thankfully later restated). Whilst the expansive plot is highly ambitious, the end of the film, playing fast and loose with physics I fear, requires a gravity-defying suspension of belief (although I guess the same could equally be said of 2001: A Space Odyssey).However, the film has stayed so firmly lodged in my mind for 24 hours I will make a rare exception to my rating 'rule'. Overall, this is a top-notch Sci-Fi film. And a final word: PEOPLEÂ… THIS IS A MUST SEE ON THE BIG SCREEN!

I literally said to myself: this is a perfect film,"During the emergency docking scene, I said to myself: ""this movie is perfect"". I couldn't fund a flaw. The story is enthralling and you feel the anxiety of the people who are struggling to survive and help others to do the same thing. There is a gravity to their work and they each show it well.My favorite genre us sci fi. This is plausible scifi, which is my favorite subset of scifi. McConnahey is amazing as usual. The young actress who plays his daughter seems like a break out star who we will def see again.The music is so good I'm learning a guitar transcription of some of the songs on the finger style guitar we site.I've seen Interstellar 7 or 8 times.

Gem of a Movie!,"Interstellar, Another feather in Nolan's cap, This movie is surely one of the Nolan's finest blend, it had everything that makes you glued to the seats and those nail biting moments I can watch it again and have the same feeling as watching it for the first time, and don't be fooled by some idiots claiming that the movie is way too technical and you need to brush up your Physics before watching the movie, don't fall for this bullshit, the movie is clear and concise and well not to mention but just like any other Nolan movie this one also leaves much to your interpretation and I believe that's what makes the movies of Nolan stand out from others, it's all about IMAGINATION with a good bit of science and what could very well be a reality, I don't want to spoil it for you by revealing any interesting parts of the movie, I would recommend the movie to anyone who loves watching fiction movies that makes you believe in the fiction they portray, yes we are far from the reality, but when you are in there watching this movie, those 3 hours you become a part of the movie and it becomes the reality, few movies have given me such experience in the past, and this one definitely tops the chart!",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Will remain the best space movie for decades.,"Interstellar quickly stole the title of my favorite movie. Christopher Nolans writing for this movie is just impeccably outstanding and unique. We've seen rescue mission space movies before, but never with an execution like this one. For as far as acting, writing and cinematography goes, this has got it all. From beautiful visuals of space we've never seen on screen before, to heartfelt moments that has stuck with me ever since I watched it for the first time.However, this movie is not for everyone. The movie can get complicated and if you don't find space interesting at all this may not be it for you. Even so, would still recommend it to everyone who has not seen it. This is a must watch. You definitely don't need to know anything about space to appreciate this cinematic marvel.Interstellar will have the title as the best space movie ever made, reserved for many decades to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
You will love it or hate it,"OK, I've just seen Interstellar and I can tell it's one of those movies that you either love or hate.Personally I loved it and probably I'm going to watch it again to process it a little bit more. It's not a simple movie, maybe that was already clear, is a Nolan's film.Matthew McConaughey does a great job by portraying Cooper. The most touching scenes are those between his character and Mackenzie Foy, who plays the younger version of Murph, Jessica Chastain character. Either it seems to be an ""Outer Space Film"" is more about human relations and how important is for us to be linked with others.Even it's a long movie, 169 minutes, I didn't felt it that long or tedious. The director managed to keep us engaged through the whole film.The experience on IMAX in 70mm film. The image quality perceived was superb, now I get why Christopher Nolan and other directors are fighting to keep film alive.I had the opportunity to watch it at the Chinese theatre and was a great experience, my first time in that theatre. The staff from the theatre even told us that Nolan himself watched several scenes of the movie in that theatre to ""calibrate"" the experience.

Interstellar is quite an intriguing space movie requiring some attention to the narrative,"Just watched this on IMAX with my movie theatre-working friend who had seen this before. It has Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway going to space and seeking possible livable planets for places to move the earth people when that planet becomes uninhabitable. Christopher Nolan directs quite a long but mostly intriguing tale of how long this journey lasts and the effect on McConaughey's offspring when they grow up without having him around during those times. I have to admit that part of me was ready to sleep during some scenes but something exciting does always come up and it gets a little better as the narrative keeps on going. So on that note, Interstellar is very much worth seeing if you're patient enough to watch quite a long movie requiring you to think.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A Brilliantly Emotional Journey,"I just returned after seeing ""Interstellar"" again (2nd time) and I can say that my second experience was even more powerful than the first. I'm trying to find the right words to express the thrilling journey that is this film.First I'd like to advice you to try and pay attention to every single line - nothing is said without purpose and everything is somehow connected. It slowly builds up with the beginning to this phenomenal emotional ride and it will not let go until the very end. It will keep you on the edge of your sit - literally -, it will make you cry, it will make you jump, it will completely absorb you. Throughout the course of it I forgot I was in a cinema. I was living every single moment with the characters, feeling what they're feeling. At times, I found myself staring blankly trying to comprehend its complexity - How can this be? Is this really happening? Can it be so epic?The second time I saw it I understood the importance of every single scene and line, I saw more connection, more intricacy and (even) more genius in it. The first time it was grand and overwhelming, it just hit me hard and I couldn't really pay attention to details.The emotional journey part was very important to me; but of course, there are the stunning visuals which contribute immensely and transcend you there, into the action. They were fantastic, superb, simply put, film-making at its finest.This is all, of course, from my point of view - a super sci-fi, fantasy, adventure and all associated genres enthusiast. Although I cannot imagine how one, regardless of their movie preferences, can dislike ""Interstellar"" - it's that good.What I'm obviously saying is GO SEE THIS MOVIE. Expect epicness. It will not disappoint.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Don't expect too much,"Just watched this in New Zealand. The IMDb rating is still above 9 at the time. Not sure it will stay there though. It's not a bad movie but it's not a great one either (which a 9 should be). It's creative in terms of story but it is drawn out. It goes for the Gravity look and feel, being slow, filmed in space and with dialog often replaced with music, but it does not have the suspense of Gravity. It's doesn't draw you in. It just doesn't have enough substance to carry it off. It has plenty of promise but lets you down in the end, especially once you pull all the pieces together to formulate what's going on. It's still worth watching, at 7/10, just don't expect a 9/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Spellbinding,"Interstellar is a science fiction film co-written and directed by Christopher Nolan (Inception, Batman: The Dark Knight etc.) and starring Matthew McConaughey. I found it absolutely amazing, rarely do I use a word like 'spellbinding' to describe a movie but I really do feel like Interstellar is well worthy of it. Matthew McConaughey was excellent as well. He really shows the great emotional range he has as an actor.The story is about a group of explorers, led by former pilot and engineer Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), who embark on a journey through a newly discovered wormhole near the planet Saturn. Their main mission is to save humanity from extinction by an environmentally devastated Earth.The film was not only beautiful to look at, but it was very well written too. However, like with Inception, you REALLY need to pay attention to pretty much everything that happens to fully understand what is going on. It's difficult for me to go into too much detail without giving away important plot points so you'll just have to see for yourself.I rate it a very high 9.5/10 and I highly recommend it to any fan of Christopher Nolan and anyone who enjoys intelligent science fiction.

Highly Overrated,"Was this movie terrible? No, but for as much praise as it got, I'm astounded. The plot was ridiculous and unbelievable. That isn't what killed the movie however, it was the acting! Maybe the director wanted the actors to act that way, but every time they did something amazing, they barely acted surprised. It was as if it was all in a days work. This is the sole reason why I can't get myself to re- watch this movie. The visuals were amazing, but I'm more interested in plot lines and character development than pretty effects (call me old school, even though I'm in my 20's). The movie tries to be like 2001: A Space Odyssey, but falls short. 2 months after watching Interstellar, not much is retained in my memory (I had to re-read the ridiculous plot and re-watch a trailer to bring my memory back). Whereas 2001 I watched 6 or so months ago and remember most of it.It may seem like I'm calling this movie terrible, it's not. It's just highly overrated and I need to point out the flaws that keep this from being a masterpiece. Maybe I've seen too many programs about space (Cosmos, The Universe, 2001, etc) that keep this movie from stunning me with the visuals, but if you're a person that has not seen too many space programs, you'd probably like it.And just an FYI, this is coming from a guy that hated Gravity and Inception.

With dazzling visuals and a gooey yet strong emotional core that's truly affecting, it's one of the best movies I've seen all year. Interstellar is a science fiction film that explores the themes of love, sacrifice, and humanity's place in the universe. The film follows a former NASA pilot who is recruited to pilot a dangerous mission through a newly discovered wormhole in search of habitable planets for humanity to colonize.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The greatest movie ever made...,"This has been one of my favorite movies ever since it was released in 2014. I've watched it countless times and Nolan is by far my favorite director, but I had never seen any of his films, besides Oppenheimer, in IMAX... until last night. I was fortunate to catch the 10 year anniversary showing of Interstellar in IMAX and was absolutely blown away. The fact that I was on the edge of my seat for a movie I know so much about is a testament to how powerful this movie is. The score is the best in any film and the space visuals are simply stunning. The film flew by and I left the theatre with my mind blown, even more than I could have anticipated. I plan to always see this movie whenever it is shown and truly believe everyone needs to experience it the way Nolan intended.1000/10... simply the greatest film I've ever seen on screen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Futuristic,"As a military chaplain, I found ""Interstellar"" (2014) thought-provoking and spiritually enriching. Director Christopher Nolan's masterpiece explores humanity's quest for survival, love, and transcendence. The film's themes resonate deeply with my experiences ministering to Filipino soldiers facing life-and-death situations.# The Search for Hope
The movie's narrative, driven by Cooper's (Matthew McConaughey) journey through wormholes, echoes the Filipino value of ""pag-asa"" (hope). Amidst uncertainty, Cooper's love for Murph (Jessica Chastain) inspires him to push beyond the boundaries of space and time. This selfless love mirrors the sacrifices our soldiers make for their families and country.# Time, Space, and Divine Providence
The film's exploration of time dilation and gravitational forces parallels the mysteries of divine providence. As Cooper navigates the vast expanse, he encounters moments of serendipity and synchronicity. These moments evoke the Filipino concept of ""kapalaran"" (destiny), reminding us that our lives are intertwined with a higher power.# Human Resilience and Sacrifice
""Interstellar"" highlights humanity's capacity for resilience and sacrifice. The astronauts' bravery and willingness to risk everything for the greater good resonate with the Filipino military's values of courage and selflessness. The film serves as a poignant reminder of the sacrifices our soldiers make to protect our nation.# A Cosmic Perspective on Faith
""Interstellar"" encourages viewers to contemplate the intersection of science, faith, and humanity. As a chaplain, I see parallels between Cooper's journey and the spiritual quest for meaning. The film inspires reflection on our place within the universe and the transcendent forces that guide us. ""Interstellar"" is a powerful exploration of human existence, love, and the mysteries that lie beyond.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Human nature as sprinkling water on plastic plants,"The film outright fails for me, because it's about all the vital stuff in life, love, loss and new discovery as each one nested in the capacity of our minds for vision. But Nolan is a logician, a geometer who has to know everything in his narrative world in advance before he can construct it. So he doesn't get any of it in an intuitive way, an allusive way, a fluid way for appearances to suggest things.He cites Zerkalo as influence, next of course to 2001, a masterwork with an elusive logic, not wholly tractable, not complete, not causal, a spontaneous capacity for images and connections between them. But he does the opposite, 2001, something tractable, complete, causal, not spontaneous. Logical.(Cool tidbit. One of the great discoveries of the past century is a limit in formal logic that implies there's more that is true than provable in a given system, something that every aware creative person knows intuitively, axiomatically to be true. I like to think this is why Malick abandoned philosophy for the cinema, proof for expression. Flipped around it means that if you stick to what is strictly provable within your narrative you must miss out on some expressible truth.)This logic screams at me in one particular strand of plot, the ghostlike presence in the girl's bedroom, at first mysterious, but it's actually Nolan's way of creating the explanation of what he's going to do inside the black hole, which is his way of creating the metaphor about love as a powerful force. How? An actual force that transcends spacetime! (Btw, all that fuss about a renowned physicist assisting the production and they go ahead and film all that black hole stuff?)In other words the only way he can create metaphor is by having it be a plot device, so that the profundity of what happens to us must be accompanied by its narrative explanation; it only succeeds in reducing the intuitions we have (about love, connectedness etc).What's left is Nolan's own journey in space towards images that expand understanding. This would be his most ambitious so far. Does he do anything interesting? The Dustbowl interviews show he wanted a more grounded approach, a good idea to start among cornfields. Better action than before. But still unimaginative.A big indication for me was the scene after Coop wakes up from cryosleep and checks his messages from Earth; an entire life has gone by, and among all the possible images that Nolan could have put there to evoke that life, in a time when so much of our vision is mobile and we carry with us cameras everywhere (even more so in that near future), he gives us static monologues before a desk. The same teary tone. What a tragedy of inexpression!The mind at play here is like the spectral Coop trapped in that boxed space behind bookshelves and able to see only loops.Nolan gambled here of course, tried to elevate himself to more than contraptions; failed. It turns out he can only roar about that night which great filmmakers gently recall without explaining. Why this man is held in high esteem in a medium that should celebrate visual ability while a modern calligrapher like Shunji Iwai is an unknown says it.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Stunning sci-fi !,"Well to me this was one of the better science-fiction movies that I ever saw. It's been a long time since I didn't see a sci-fi like this one. It's extremely long but you won't get bored for a second. And that says enough about it. All the actors gave us a very good performance and some shots were stunning. The story was very well written even though sometimes too complicated to understand but then again who are we to understand anything about the unknown dimensions, black holes or wormholes. You have got to stay concentrated during the whole movie to understand the story but like I said before with Interstellar it is certainly not a problem at all. I was completely absorbed by the story and was actually surprised that time flew by so easily. One of the better movies I watched this year and certainly the best sci-fi in years.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Don't believe the hype,"""Interstellar"" was an above average film and I have no regrets spending a Friday night checking it out. Unsophisticated audiences may enjoy it if they don't analyze it too deeply. However, if you are one who understands the world of physics, aviation, or space travel, this one is hard to watch. There are a plethora of continuity issues as well as plot holes. It seems like Chris Nolan watched ""Gravity"" and decided he could make a really terrible film into something worth watching. He added the ""Contact"" premise and inserted some Physics theories and some expanded back story to create a mediocre film. I was hopeful that I would be impressed by the obviously inflated reviews but I wasn't. The guy next to me actually fell asleep during the first hour which was very grueling. Of our group, there were three thumbs down and one thumbs up.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Interstellar: How Film Can Make you Feel Adventure Again,"Every generation of movie goers sees one film, maybe two, that changes the game for them. It becomes a signature moment that they remember years to come. They remember where they saw it, who they saw it with, even where they were sitting. Christopher Nolan has proved to be a film maker who works best with a big canvas, and he has never been given a canvas bigger than the one he used for his latest film, ""Interstellar"". I feel I can't even call going to see a Nolan piece a movie but more like an ""event"". For the average movie goer, they most likely aren't familiar with the directors of the films they're seeing but most know Nolan. Most know of Nolan because he has made some of the biggest, thrilling, and thought provoking films of the past decade from the Dark Knight trilogy to Inception.It's almost not worth trying to do a plot synopsis of ""Interstellar"" because it is difficult to try to condense the happenings in a film this huge because I know that I will leave out something big. Anyway, the film takes place in a potentially not-too-distant future where the earth has become unable to produce all but a few crops and it will get to a point where none will be able to grow and man will die out. In comes an engineer/pilot/father Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) who is entrusted to be part of a space expedition to venture beyond a newly discovered wormhole to try and find a new planet capable of inhabiting the human race. Astronauts from previous missions have supposedly landed and have been sending signals for them to come.McConaughey has always had that ""movie star"" potential and I think this is the film that puts him in that title. This was a truly star making role due to the size of the film and I honestly believe he is the only man who could have done it. ""Interstellar"" was originally supposed to be done by Steven Spielberg before he dropped out and Nolan stepped in. Nolan, clearly influenced by past Spielberg films like ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""Jaws"", puts McConaughey in a role in the same vein as Richard Dreyfuss in ""Close Encounters"" or Roy Schneider in ""Jaws"". They needed an actor who could be looked at as an everyday guy who is experiencing incredible circumstances and McConaughey is able to display the emotion required for a man who has to drop everything, including his family whom he knows he may not see again, and try to save the human race. You can see it in his eyes and hear it in his voice and your heart breaks and lifts with his simultaneously. This isn't necessarily a role that wins Oscars but it should be.The effects are obviously amazing. This, much like ""Gravity"" last year, is a film that needs to be seen on the big screen, especially in IMAX. This, along with the haunting score of frequent Nolan collaborator Hans Zimmer, almost transports you to that necessary place that makes the events happening on screen seem possible. Kind of piggy backing off of that point, there will be those who will trash the film for ""the science isn't accurate"". Those comments are nonsense because no matter what ""science"" tells us, there is just no way for us to actually comprehend what is beyond a wormhole or what would happen if we attempted to go through one. Could we really transcend time and space? Would we discover new worlds and new civilizations? Impossible for us to say at this point, but what makes this film so great is that we are able to see the ideas of ""what can be"". It's the mystery of the unknown that both frightens and enthralls man and few films have been able to capture those feelings like ""Interstellar"" In a time where there are no more explorers, we're fortunate to be put in a position where we can feel what is like to discover and explore new worlds.People will remember ""Interstellar"" for either being a truly great film experience or ""not as good as 2001: A Space Odyssey"". This is one of most popular slights against the film so far as it is the closest thing to ""2001"" and defenders of the Kubrick classic will argue to the death that it doesn't live up to it. This is an argument that no one will win because it is a generational issue. People see these landmark films during their youth and they leave such an impression on them, that it almost becomes blasphemy to hear of another film made years later, rivaling the one they saw. People want to believe that the film from their time was the best and that no film will be able to capture those emotions they first felt and the memories that it created for them. I respect and detest this because I will most likely feel the same way when future space adventures in the same vein as ""Interstellar"" come out and I fear it is something that is out of my control. Much of the film circles around the idea that love is the one true thing that travels purely through time and space because it is that connection we feel with one another that makes us human and that can be applied with our love for certain films. The connection we feel with our favorite films is almost unshakable and those who think they can make us waver from those feelings are exercising in futility.In the end, ""Interstellar"" is one of those landmark films. It's a chance for us to escape reality and feel sense of adventure, hope, and amazement that rarely comes around. Don't miss it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

An attempt at epic story telling that does not quite make it.,"A long, tedious movie. It attempts to be an epic but fails. It attempts to say something profound, but the message is garbled. The movie attempts to mix jumbled pseudo-scientific dialogue with a melodramatic subplot involving a father and daughter, producing a muddled story with little dramatic power. The movie contains elements from 2001: A Space Odyssey and the Matrix, with its bombastic musical flourishes and the special effects meant to depict extra-dimensionality, all pure Hollywood. Matthew McConaughey is the principal actor; his character, Cooper, is the central figure of the story; the rest of the cast are supporting characters (their placement in the credits notwithstanding). McConaughey gives an interesting performance, which includes several scenes in which he weeps, which for a leading man is remarkable. The depiction of earth as a doomed planet is unconvincing and the plan to colonize other planets half-baked and one that tests the limits of plausibility. Being a science-fiction movie, stretching the boundaries of science for literary purposes is to be expected, but this movie asks the audience to accept certain premises that just do not make sense (e.g, acceleration of time; relationship of time to gravity; time as a material object). This movie is proof that when Hollywood attempts to deal with time warps, time holes, multi-dimensionality, relativity, and other complex scientific theories, the results can be less than optimum.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Nolan's Sci-fi magic strikes again on the big screen,"""Do not go gentle into that good night; Old age should burn and rave at close of day."" that was one hell of a dialog from the movie #INTERSTELLAR even though it was inspired from a poem.Chris Nolan made a film which make's even science freaks also don't know some of 'em which he implied in the film. It is evidently clear that he doesn't like this 3-D world which instead he created 5-D world and made 'Time' as a physical quantity in his world. Literally there is no words to explain the ingenuity of Chris. The way he crafted the characters and effectively using technical expertise and screen writing definitely make us to taste 'Transcendence'. once again he proved that he is not a contemporary director but a director who evolved from unrealistic future.Matt did a splendid job by portraying 'cooper' and express his emotions as a destitute and grief-stricken father was incomparable. Hans zimmer, he is at his best. Anne and Jess made justice to their roles. Matt Damon and Michael Caine played a pivotal role as well. Chris also made 'India' as part of his film because of 'M.O.M' i think, even though it is little about India i think. overall film is astoundingly superb with intense screenplay unless you detest physics or you lack keenness but its better to study a Lil'bit before 'bon appetite'. Remember ""do not go gentle into that good movie"".#INTERSTELLAR and #INCEPTION are the best sci-fi masterpieces i've ever seen in this decade. Take a bow Chris Nolan and ""orgoglioso DI es sere UN fan DI Christopher Nolan''",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Grade: A+,"Interstellar marks a critical moment in the career of Christopher Nolan; he has come a long way from being the indie noir director of Memento and Insomnia, to striking gold in the enormously popular Dark Knight franchise. Inception was proof Nolan could successfully tackle a big- budget, original idea outside of the Batman series, but with comic book films behind him, Interstellar has to sell on the promise that Nolan is not a one-hit wonder of big-budget original ideas.The movie's plot focuses on Cooper, a Southerner and family man who doesn't quite understand why man is turning away from flight. ""We used to look up at the stars and wonder about our place in the stars,"" he says, ""Â…now we just look at the ground and see dirt."" Matthew McCoughaney shines in the role of Cooper, delivering one of his career-best. Cooper is an everyman, and nothing in this world (or any other) is more important to him than his kids; in particular, his daughter Murphy, played spectacularly by Mackenzie Foy.Despite great performances from a huge ensemble, beautiful visuals and setting, shot by first- time Nolan cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema (Let The Right One In), Interstellar features a typical problem in every Nolan movie: too much expository dialogue. It is very obvious in numerous moments that Nolan is trying to feed us information and backstory. My other issue with the opening of the film is pacing. Thought the movie establishes the world and doesn't rush to do so, the movie rushes off into space the moment the idea of interstellar travel is introduced. From the first act, it is unclear whether Interstellar can deliver.It's in the second act where the movie really begins to blossom. Much of the film from this point on is set in space, and boasts mind-bending special effects as timeless as 2001: A Space Odyssey. The movie features some strikingly similar shots, clearly paying homage to the classic space opera. A lot of the shots are wonderful, and Interstellar features the best cinematography in any of his films (sorry Wally Pfister), but a few times, I found myself wondering the purpose of some of these shots of the ship ""Endurance"". Interstellar reaches for the stars, but in act two still seems unsure of where it may land.In addition to great visuals, the sound design and score are top-notch. Hans Zimmer does some of his best work, bringing in a score that is both celestial and organic; it perfectly balances tones we normally associate with outer space, while hitting all the right emotional notes. And the movie knows when to be quiet in space; not just outside the ship, but inside. I loved the moments where things were so silent you could hear the background whirring of computers, the slight creaking of the ship, the breath of the characters. The attention to detail in both sight and sound made the movie feel real.When the plot does finally introduce a ""villain"" in it's second act, the movie starts to feel it may have overstayed it's welcome. Interstellar runs at 169 minutes, and it's a long one admittedly. Cooper and Amelia, played by a well-cast Anne Hathaway, are finally forced into unforeseeable circumstances, and Christopher Nolan does not hold back. This makes for some heartstring- tugging sequences, and Interstellar may have benefited from stepping on the brakes with some of the emotionally heavy content, but the acting is so good, that it doesn't matter if it's slightly overdone, and it all builds it to a marvelous climax.Interstellar's third act is as stunning as anything I've ever seen in film. For critics who thought Inception was proof that Christopher Nolan was not very imaginative visually with free reign, Interstellar proves them wrong. Thematically and scientifically, the movie dares to challenge, it dares its audience to follow into the unknown, beyond the horizon. I am still trying to wrap my head around it all.Nolan's blockbuster epic is not perfect, and it's not for the common audience. If you're looking for big action sequences, or looking to turn your brain off for awhile, you're in the wrong movie. It's got some bumps along the way, but Interstellar is visionary for our time, and so bold in its execution, that it is not bogged down by its few flaws. I was thrilled to take the ride. Interstellar is thought-provoking, emotional, cinematic, and a wonder to behold, which in time, should earn its title in the league of great science fiction.Grade: A+",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Not sure what the fuss is about,"Not a terrible movie but not half as good as some reviewers would have you believe. Firstly a lot has been made of you needing a degree in quantum physics to understand the movie. Not so, the premise is exactly the same as his last move 'inception', time moves slower the deeper you go or in this case nearer the event horizon of a black-hole. Don't need to be a genius to understand that.Secondly a lot has been made of his revolutionary mixing of 'dazzling' science fiction and an intimate human story. As for the human story, it's clunky and at times cringe-worthy. It's dull and not particularly well handled with amateurish dialogue characteristic of the Nolan films. If you want to see a movie where the relationship between father and daughter is far better handled watch 'Contact'. As for the science fiction I'd have to say I was disappointed. Parts were very spectacular but I was not impressed by the planet scenes. Iceland yet again and a water planet with shallow seas and massive waves? I was somehow expecting more than this.Overall grossly over-rated by the critics yet go and see it all the same.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"Thought-provoking adventure,","This movie felt like it tried to accomplish two simultaneous and somewhat incompatible endeavors.First, it was thought-provoking. Many questions were raised. What would life on earth be like if our climate runs amok? What happens to government when we all have to live hand-to-mouth? Are ""they"" out there communicating with us? Is it the essence of humanity to survive, or is it to pioneer, and, by extension, evolve? Second, it was also an adventure. I watched this in a full IMAX theater, with eighty bajillion watts of Super Thunder-Round Sound, or whatever the kids call it now. The visual effects definitely shine on the IMAX screen. The format switches occasionally, and usually imperceptibly, between 70mm for the scenes with dialogue, to IMAX format for that full-on dose of retina-overload spectacle. This movie is a wonderfully fun ride through a strangely familiar extra-galactic world. There are also plenty of tense moments, after which you realize you've been holding your breath.I'm glad I went to watch this. That said, I think the film suffers a little from trying to be both an adventure thrill about the dangers of space travel, let alone an actual confrontation with a nemesis, and also a multi-layered allegory involving the dimensional tangle of time, gravity, love, and what it means to survive.It asks more questions than it explores. While it fills in for the missing answers with white-knuckled brushes with death, it wasn't as intellectually satisfying as I hoped. I spent an hour discussing the thoughtful components with a friend. In the end, we were grasping to find symbolism, metaphors, or other messages about humanity. We never coalesced ""the message"" of the movie.But did we need to? It was, as I said, also a thrill ride. The adventurous climax was a little less than terrifyingly dramatic; I can't say I had the same post-climactic cathartic experience as I've had for other movies. But it was a definite end, closing most of the open plot points. I certainly felt moved by the characters' resolutions.I was suspicious that Matthew McConaughey could convince me that he was a space-ready engineer; it turns out that he didn't need to, because he did convince me that he was a dad that loved his children as much as any dad could. I think all the leads delivered solidly: Caine, Lithgow, Hathaway, Damon, Chastain, Affleck... I connected with the characters and felt their pain and happiness.Hans Zimmer played up the drama in the music a little heavily, I thought, and unnecessarily. It wound up creating the opposite of the effect I think he intended. Many of the scenes could have used a lighter touch, musically. Some of them worked brilliantly.Although I had my quibbles, the final analysis is that I would definitely choose to watch the movie a second time, but I'm not making plans to, for now.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
No words,"As a sci-fi fan, who loves 2001 SO, Contact, Gravity and many other movies that deal with with the topics also covered in Interstellar, I have to say, I have no words to describe the movie.

It fits the movie so well that it was like the movie was made to fit the OST and not the other way around. There is an interview with Christopher Nolan, in which he states that he wouldn't allow Hans Zimmer to know exactly what the movie's plot device is, he only told to him that he has to focus on the connection between father and daughter. If this is the truth - WOW! it worked flawlessly!I won't go and describe what I saw on the big screen because this is something that anyone that goes to see the movie has to experience for himself... I can only tell you that after I saw the credits, I attempted to get off my seat, it didn't worked. I tried again, pushing harder - it barely worked. Moments after I was at the theater's exit heading out for the bus. I saw it coming just right on time with me, but I didn't get on. I was compelled to walk and think. Think of what I saw... My head was aching, my ears too and my eyes were closing only to call back images from the movie. I got home and found myself undressed and dressed with my casual home clothes. Then I realized that I have also walked the 7 kilometers road to my home without noticing... I was still in the movie, I must definitely been, because only there the time behaved the way I was feeling while coming home...",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Absolutely brilliant, a masterpiece, one of the best films ever!","I went to watch this film, not knowing much about the background of the story or what it was exactly about. It started off well, although in my opinion it did drag on for a long period of time before they actually ended up in space. This does not effect the film though or my rating one bit, as it all worked out in the end and the build up was necessary! The special effects in this film are awesome, and are used in a way which I was literally at the edge of my seat, in shear anticipation, suspense and a slight sense of nervousness. Its very tense in many parts, and it certainly keeps you thinking. I don't know how people in the right state of mind can give this film a 1 star, or say 'disappointing', 'rubbish' 'stick to batman, Nolan'! These people don't know what they are talking about and are just trying to be picky and find a way to make the film look bad! Its a brilliant film, something suitable for all the family!

WOW,"I was speechless when I finished this film, the story, acting and visuals just seem to good to be true.
For a film with such a big scale, it does a great job establishing the world and characters, it can be a lot to take in bit there is just so much emotional payoff that it makes it worth sitting through 3 Hours of film.
I won't spoil anything, but the ending is just perfect. It makes you want more from the film but in a way that doesn't make it unsatisfying.I really have no complaints, it does everything it sets out to do, it is a real shame this didn't win any Oscars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Breathtaking,"After watching Interstellar for the second time it jumped 20 places on my all-time favorite movies from 20th to 1st. I don't know why Matthew McConaughey didn't win another Oscar for his absolute amazing performance; the guy really gives his all when he's on camera. The story isn't your typical, perfunctory alien/space movie but instead centers around how the current generation has the power to make or break the future depending on how they utilize their resources and how some humans tend to be so selfish when hard times come (dialogue at 28 minutes). Moreover, it really is the first movie that really explained the four dimensions of space and time to me in utterly breathtaking fashion. Nolan really managed to make astronomy interesting again and in a world where education is becoming undervalued, inspires us to grow and learn. The movie is filled to the brim with dialogues and lessons that everyone can learn from and understand. Hans Zimmer delivered possibly the greatest ever soundtrack of all time (goosebumps!) to complement the beautiful CGI and remarkable storytelling. Interstellar isn't a movie, its an experience. Unfortunately I cannot give it more than 10 stars because it absolutely does deserve higher.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Ghost Protocol,"There are moments during ""Interstellar"" which may be compared to ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (a better movie). There are moments during ""Interstellar"" which may be compared to ""Prometheus"" (also, a better movie). There are even moments and storytelling techniques within ""Interstellar"" that are completely ripped off from ""Inception"" (a much better movie, from Christopher Nolan himself). That said, ""Interstellar"" should still be touted as the most ambitious film of the year so far, and in the same breath, should ultimately go down as one of director Christopher Nolan's worst films to date.This highly anticipated Nolan project depicts a future riddled with dust storms, where the world's food supply is nearly depleted (or at least 40 to 60 years out from being depleted, but that doesn't sound nearly as dire) where astronauts are working as farmers and children are taught that the Apollo space missions were faked. During this time, an underground government institution called NASA commissions a group of astronauts (including Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway) for a top secret space mission. This mission will have them traveling through a newly discovered wormhole, with the promise of finding another inhabitable world.OK, let's get right to it. Any praise I heap upon this movie will be directed at the final 90 minutes of this two hour and 49 minute long film, since the first 80 or so minutes of ""Interstellar"" (while absolutely gorgeous at times to behold) is drenched in sequences of McConaughey seemingly reenacting moments from those pretentious Lincoln car ads, caught in a continuous and almost finger wagging diatribe about how the human race was never meant to die on earth, which nearly put me to sleep. In other words, the first half of this is as slow and lifeless as watching a dead astronaut drift through space. Anyway, this is Intersellar's fatal flaw, since the latter half is ripe with big budget yet very symbolic action sequences, stunning cinematography and fascinating talking points dealing with the nature of human survival in the face of an unsympathetic universe, due to some really insightful slabs of dialogue from a script written by Nolan and his brother, Jonathan. Even the literal rocket science lingo becomes more and more palatable as the ""gravity"" of this plot begins to set in, near the midpoint of Act 2.Final Thought/The Ending: Allow me to take a quick spoiler free moment to discuss this ending. During the final act of ""Interstellar"", for most film nerds, Nolan's story will be encroaching on the hallowed grounds of Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". Some will admire the sheer ballsyness of what he does in this pivotal moment and others will find it in bad taste. Though this is not a huge issue, since I don't believe this niche group will have much effect on ticket sales, the problem is that for the millions who didn't see ""Interstellar"" for any film school aesthetic reason, Nolan's ending will simply come off as so strange and obnoxiously far-fetched, that many may leave the theater angry that the punch-line wasn't worth the nearly three hour set up.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

I'm a big Nolan fan... and I'm disappointed,"Let me bring you this in overview.PRO: - Stunning visually, through and through - Good acting by the entire cast - Interesting concept - A strong second half - A somewhat satisfying ending - A few interesting twists - The main musical theme is amazing.CON: - It took too long for anything truly interesting to happen. It had a few good moments, but in general the whole first half of the movie was... a tiny bit boring. If it hadn't been a Nolan movie, I would probably have left in the break. I'm glad I didn't. But the first half makes me not want to see this movie again. - There are really too many plot holes. Or moments that are not well-explained enough for them to be plausible. Things like characters experiencing revelations based on... well, pretty much nothing. Especially near the end. Which doesn't take away from the awesomeness of the second half. But one has to overlook these things to enjoy the story. - Besides the main theme, most of the score seem misplaced. Too loud. Too bombastic. Or not adding to the emotions on screen. And I'm speaking as a huge Hans Zimmer fan here.All in all, I would recommend seeing it. Definitely.

"Like a Vermeer, sometimes it takes years to truly appreciate a masterpiece","I've had a strange relationship with this movie over the years.I didn't have the chance to see it in movie theaters when it came out, but caught up with it on streaming release & immediately liked it except for some sections of jarring dialogue & unnecessary exposition - which admittedly took up only about 2% of the movie, but had an outsized effect on me because - well - I expected and desperately wanted perfection.When I viewed it the second time, I was even more angry with the Nolan team for the few mistakes of the film. After all, this was the movie I'd been waiting for someone to make for years. Why couldn't it have been perfect?I saw it a third time. Why, you may ask? Because despite the errors the story haunted me. And I had to admit to myself that it was beautifully executed & acted, with possibly the best soundtrack in movie history. It was on this viewing that I managed to just let go & relax into the film.I was stunned.How could I have missed this masterpiece? A complex, tightly knit, scientifically accurate story (Kip Thorne won the Nobel prize in physics later in 2017) that seemed to have been plucked right out of some fictional ether, instead of painstakingly worked out around a table in a story room. Some stories are like that; they feel more real than real, like they've always existed and were waiting for a hand to snatch them and gift them to us.It occurred to me too that some works of art, like this film, can have a sort of 'emergence' - that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, and that it may well take time for a culture to come to recognize its true greatness. I see now that the flaws of this film are very small and actually don't matter at all. The movie's greatness transcends its own mistakes.I don't know if any movie will ever be made to match Interstellar. As sad as that makes me, I'm happy enough to just keep watching and re-watching.

Multi-dimensional mess,"9.1 at IMDb? Seriously?? 4 of my 5 stars are for the visual effects. 1 star is for McConaugh and Hathaway. The Nolan brothers, however, get zilch for their bullshit cosmology mixed with banal sentimentality and quasi-philosophy. It is a mystery to me, why some filmmakers love to mix so much ""science"" into their movies, when most of it is so horrendously unrealistic, misleading, incomprehensible and incorrect. Kubrick avoided most of the science talk, and created an artistic expression of the space-and-time mystery. That's why ""2001"" will remain a masterpiece and why ""Interstellar"" will be soon forgotten.

excellent movie,"We just watched INTERSTELLAR, an incredibly well written movie with an excellent cast. It does not surprise us that it didn't even get mentioned for academy awards. Usually the award winning movies are pretty common and filled with outlandish special effects to make bad story appealing. Interstellar has realistic special effects, a futuristic plot and an excellent cast.""Interstellar is a story about the earth dying, with its soil no longer able to sustain crops other than corn, and of course, it will lead to the extinction of humanity. Our hero is an ex-NASA test pilot named Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a typical ordinary-guy-in-an-extraordinary- situation everyman who's also a dedicated family man, especially toward his daughter Murphy (named after the Murphy's Law). In an all-too-Armageddon style our hero gets invited by the (publicly) defunct NASA to become humanity's last hope in finding a new home, for they have found a wormhole near Saturn (2001, anyone?) which will warp the astronauts to another galaxy in quest of a habitable planet. Solid and compact premise, although it's been used before.""",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Ambitious but pretentious and plodding, Christopher Nolan's sci-fi epic strains for greatness, poignancy and monumentality, but falls thuddingly short","How do we begin to describe 'Interstellar', Christopher Nolan's most ambitious film to date? There will probably be no doubt, once you've seen it, that it reaches for the stars; whether it manages to get there is quite something else altogether. Whereas 'Inception' showed the filmmaker's refusal to be restrained by physical dimension, his latest sees him attempt to take an even bigger leap across space and time, envisioning our three-dimensional reality as part of a larger five-dimensional whole, and employing some of the very best technical wizards to create such wondrously dazzling visuals that you cannot help but be mesmerised.By imagery alone, it is flawless. A dying dust-choked planet Earth in the near future is depicted in a somewhat familiar yet eerily unsettling landscape of agrarian society. A single spacecraft is seen as a gleaming spark against Saturn's giant gaseous rings. Bright flashes alternate with pitch darkness as the same spacecraft enters a wormhole to emerge in a different galaxy. Each planet we explore in this brand new world is a sight to marvel in itself - one an endless expanse of water where waves rise higher than the eye can see; another is pure ice, where even the clouds are snow chunks. And amidst such surreal beauty, the one scene that will probably stay in your head for a while is that of different moments in time as a binary puzzle, meant to illustrate a key relationship in the film about gravity and time.Since his breakthrough hit 'Memento', Christopher has displayed a fascination with twisting time, and 'Interstellar' is no different. It may unfold in a largely linear fashion, but it plays with time more than you realise. On one hand, time is relative, such that one hour on a foreign planet counts for seven Earth years passed - so much so that while Matthew McConaughey's NASA test pilot named Cooper looks the same throughout the film, Timothee Chalamet and Mackenzie Foy as his 15- year son Tom and 10-year old daughter Murphy are replaced midway by Casey Affleck and Jessica Chastain respectively. That is the easier part - and then there is the scientific mumbo-jumbo that sees time in the context of black holes, gravitational singularities and the possibility of extra-dimensional space.Another hallmark of Christopher's films has been their cerebral aspirations, but 'Interstellar' surpasses all his previous works by (over)reaching into an unnecessarily convoluted labyrinth of hokey quantum physics. To be sure, it is very serious about being serious, throwing about plenty of technical dialogue and making no apologies for assuming that its audience for smart intelligent beings. A lot of that will undoubtedly whiz by on the first viewing, but by trying to engage on such an intellectual level, it ultimately becomes the cause of its undoing with a logic-defying second half that cross- cuts furiously between Cooper in a race-against-time up in space and Murphy in a similar position back on Earth. Even without thinking too much into it, one already gets the nagging sense that it violates its very own relativity principle of one hour versus seven years.Yet ironically, that is also the most entertaining segment of the film, which otherwise spends too much time (in Earth years, we may add) on melodramatic partings and monotonous stretches in space. With his brother, Johnathan, Christopher wraps the heady interstellar voyage around the bond between parent and child, or more specifically, that between Cooper and Murphy, who takes the parting especially badly; but these supposedly heart-rending scenes at the start are overwrought, and no thanks to Hans Zimmer's incessantly intrusive score, terribly manipulative. In contrast, a simple scene where the camera is simply trained on Cooper as he cries his eyes out watching years and years of backlogged video messages left by his son back on Earth is much more poignant - and without a soundtrack that instructs you how to feel.Much as Christopher tries to ground the movie in the humanity between Cooper and Murphy, 'Interstellar' is better appreciated as an exposition on big ideas - and there are many bandied about here. Mankind's place in space is encapsulated in McConaughey's lament that ""we used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars; now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt"". Much later on, Matt Damon pops up to make an emphatic point about survival as the primal instinct, and by that, we mean survivial of the individual, not the human race. That is nicely contrasted against the motivation behind Cooper's mission itself, which his mentor Professor Brand (Michael Caine) reveals on his deathbed to be much more selfless - or selfish, depending on your perspective - than what he had initially told Cooper.Similarly, 'Interstellar' is a film of many contradictions. It wants so desperately to be intellectual, so it grounds its science in the theories of renowned CalTech physicist Kip Thorne, but it violates these principles in favour of building a more thrilling (and complex) narrative. It wants to be moving, but it under-develops the relationships between its characters and then tries to wring emotion out of every intimate scene. And at the heart of it is an unblinking motivation to be important, to be significant, to be monumental, to matter like Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece did, and to be both science and fiction at the same time. Indeed, there is no doubt it reaches for the stars, but 'Interstellar' remains right where we are - gazing up at these constellations, and never quite getting any closer to them.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A visual treat for Sci-Fi fans,"As I begin this review of Christopher Nolan's latest movie, I want to point out the gorgeous visuals that we as an audience were able to behold with Interstellar. I truly believe this to be the movie's best quality and a true feat for the people in charge of visual effects. Having said this, I believe that many viewers were divisive over the plot's complexities. In fact, this is the most emotion driven movie I've seen from Nolan, something that he isn't ultimately known for. Nolan's strenght as a director lies in his ability to present us with a vision. He is meticulous and works the technical aspect of a film like no other director today. Once again, this is proved in every frame shot for Interstellar. So leaving behind my long praise, I now redirect this review to the story.The earth is dying, as the effects of our abuse of the natural resources is taking out the crops of food we need to survive. Upon this dark scenario, former NASA engineer Cooper (McConaughey) is asked to pilot a spaceship with the purpose of crossing a wormhole that will lead to another galaxy. This, of course, in hopes of reaching three possible habitable planets explored by scientists sent there in previous missions. Given the unpredictable nature of an unknown environment such as a different galaxy, Cooper will have to decide whether he is willing to sacrifice everything for the sake of humanity or if the urge to reunite with his daughter again is stronger. Personally I liked the story Nolan told us with this film, as it left you thinking about it after the movie was over, something Nolan does very well with his projects. Compared with his previous work, there are still movies that I love more than this. Still Interstellar is a brilliant film in it's own right and yet another great addition to this great director's Filmograhpy.In the end all I can say is, if you're a Sci-Fi fan, you surely must not miss this one. It will offer an unique visual experience and leave you wondering what the hell you just watched, even if you didn't feel completely satisfied.Rating: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
vastly overrated,"reading the other reviews here its hard to conceive that I watched the same movie everyone is gushing about. the central premise is hardly noble although perhaps quite the likely selfish outcome i.e. after trashing this planet lets go trash some others. the black hole visualizations were quite lame. this is not a great sci-fi film even remotely in the league of 2001 although a cursory superficial viewing might suggest so to an unthinking non-sci-fi buff. a great scifi film would naturally start by 1st adapting a great scifi story. these are yet to be made such as ringworld, dyson spheres and fleet of worlds concepts. to think that all these mind boggling stories exist yet this rather old and tired story concept is chosen to lavish money on is strange, although it is somewhat understandable as the afore-mentioned stories would be much greater challenges all around and so its best that they are ignored rather than poorly realized as this primarily propaganda piece.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Sci-Fi with a Big Heart,"The Earth in the near future is a shell of what it used to be. The plant life is dying. The very soil that used to sustain it is destroying it. There are some underground efforts headed by Prof. Brand (Michael Caine) called Lazarus to find an alternative world to settle in somewhere out there in the vast reaches of space. Three such potential worlds have been found beyond a black hole near Saturn.Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is a retired NASA engineer who had been chosen to pilot this effort to seek out and investigate these alternative planets. Despite the stiff objections of his 10-year old daughter Murphy (Mackenzie Foy), he accepts the mission and lifted off together with his crew of three scientists, Amelia (Anne Hathaway), Doyle (Wes Bentley) and Romilly (David Gyasi).From there, we are brought on an unparalleled adventure of space, time and humanity by a master who is probably the most mentally-challenging writer and director in the film industry today, Christopher Nolan. Front and center in this spectacular sci-fi film is the timeless bond between a father and his daughter. The poetic story he has written is multi- layered and emotional, despite its scientific jargon and bleak settings.As with his other projects, Nolan works with some of the best technical talents, many of whom are award-winners in their fields. Everyone on this team are guaranteed at least Oscar nominations for their work in this film, and they may in fact all actually win.Film editor Lee Smith, sound engineers Gregg Landaker and Gary Rizzo and musical scorer Hans Zimmer together effectively create excitement and drama. The cinematography of Hoyte van Hoytema is breathtaking especially in those wide landscape shots, both on earth and on those other planets. The visual effects are innovative as ever, particularly in the third act where a whole new dimension was created. Production designer Nathan Crowley had some nifty ideas for his futuristic props. The circular design of the mother ship Endurance was beautiful in its symmetry. The designs of the robotic sidekicks TARS and CASE are in no way similar those in Star Wars.Matthew McConaughey continues his streak of acting excellence which was just capped by an Oscar earlier this year. Michael Caine was as good as he could be expected to be. However, I found his final speech too garbled to be understood well, and it contained an important plot point. Anne Hathaway's role is a bit of a puzzle for me. While she was actually managed to be credible as a scientist, she had a rather cheesy monologue that seemed out of place when it was delivered.Three talented actresses portray the character of Murphy Cooper at different ages: Mackenzie Foy, Jessica Chastain and Ellen Burstyn. Foy goes way beyond what she was required to do in her two previous hit films the ""Breaking Dawn"" films and ""The Conjuring"". Chastain is such a riveting presence as ever, and it was good to see her again after her long break after ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and ""Mama."". Oscar winner Burstyn's singular big scene made me tear up.In the second hour, I was surprised to see a special, heretofore uncredited, big name guest star portray one of the pioneer Lazarus astronauts, Dr. Mann. This was more than a mere cameo appearance, as his character had a critical role to play in one of the many twisting episodes of this story.From ""Memento"", then ""The Prestige"" to ""Inception"", Nolan had gone for the extremes in terms of plot development. His work is not always easily comprehended on first watch. They are thought-provoking and demanding in terms of a viewer's patience and concentration. ""Interstellar"" joins this stellar list, and we are brought to yet another dimension of time and space. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

There is a crisis with the crops,earth is running out of food, a lot of dust, no explanation for any of it, just accept it. the film is pretty humourless and lot of mumbling about nothing interesting in particular from the lead..he's an ex nasa pilot who has a farm...sits on the porch drinking a beer and gets philosophical with john lythgow ...more mumbling. Struggling to stay awake.Okay so the next act things pick up, we have loud launch into space, I'm awake again. Then silence, after all that's whats space is like y'know. Can now hear people munching popcorn. Too quiet. Oh look huge water planet, vast and empty much like this film so far. Huge wave comes.Ah some entertainment at last, clunky robot runs around... then Matt damon ! the last act, blackholes and then there is an semi interesting twist to earlier events.This was a frustrating film, had a lot of potential with the story but on an entertaining and thought provoking level it doesn't get there. It starts and stalls. Did anyone really care about the characters? i certainly didn't invest. Obviously some people love it with the scores on here but i cannot agree.This is not a masterpiece in sci-fi by any means. There are comparisons to 2001 but don't even go there.I actually looked at my watch towards the end of the film to see how long I'd been trapped in this cinematic black hole.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Terrible film,"This movie would have been better if it was only about TARS and drones and robots and completely remove humans characters and the damn corny filler dialogue.All that hard science, special effects, scientists working together, making it seem most real bound together by fantasy and bullshit and missing plot lines and time paradoxes and love and religion. This movie is really a cheeseball Hollywood film with a hard science backdrop.The characters were as flat as a piece of paper. The guy likes the girl, the daughter is mad at dad, dad loves daughter doesn't care about saving mankind. Even TARS had more personality than many of the movie's characters. The daughter was probably most developed but felt so off.

Overrated,"Nice effects but the storyline although very much hyped for its scientific accuracy is absolutely nonsense. Wormholes do not exist for a start. The view of the black hole might be somehow accurate but the idea that you could somehow get close to the accretion disk and survive is hilarious. The end of the movie is rather pathetic and free of any realistic aspect's. Maybe someone without any scientific background believes in the pseudo science of this movie but advertising this movie for realism is a very long shot.

"It starts very well, but unfortunately it doesn't stay that way","""Interstellar"" is one of Christopher Nolan's best-known films, praised by many for its compelling story and visual style. At the same time, although the film starts out really spectacular and interesting, it struggles with many flaws. Let me break it down.Nolan's direction is great, one of his most atmospheric ones besides ""Inception"". The film is visually outstanding, both the cinematography and the effects look beautiful. The performances are fantastic, especially from Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway. The film's score is brilliant, Hans Zimmer's music is incredibly well composed and without a doubt, it adds to the atmosphere. However, although the story of the film begins interestingly and engagingly, it gets too confusing at the end. The ending feels way too much and completely out of place. Unfortunately, this is the low point of ""Interstellar"", and even considering its strengths, it remained a mediocre experience for me.So, all in all, although ""Interstellar"" starts really well, the ending unfortunately detracts from the overall viewing experience, and at the end of the day, it's nothing extraordinary.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A Dumbing Down Experience,"A lot of mistaken pop science and poor attention to details makes this film a dumbing experience. Films based in history, biography and science need both the writers and viewers to do the hard work of reading the appropriate research so that we are bettered by the film experience. Director's/producers need to pay attention to detail for excellence. As follows: 1. Blight is usually strain or variety specific and is easily constrained by climate variability and solved easily with cross or genetic breeding. Source and type of blights was never explained probably because it just can't happen the way depicted. 2. Dust storms would be limited to a few limited environs and would soon hit bedrock. Besides, crop rotation and contouring should have solved that problem. 3. Drone was suppose to have been aloft for years using solar panels, but no solar panels visible. Propulsion was? 4. The pulp fiction fable of no Apollo/non-moon landing event is not taken seriously by anyone who is a middle school graduate. 5. McConaughey did his famous finger rubbing thinking prior to kicking a tire but what makes no sense is how kicking a tire makes a vehicle functional. 6. Movie relied on an excessive amount of loud tonal sound effects to create drama when writing and acting just not up to the task. 7. Communicating in barcode or Morse is not how any intelligent future beings would rely on. And, later the gravityâ€“quantum equations coming from the future in Morse which doesn't have Calc encodings. Certainly not through watch hand movement. 8. Female role model in Hathaway was cast for smile/looks not for contributing anything believably intelligent. 9. Dad, Dr. Brand, also poorly cast only for accent and stereotyped science look. 10. Dropping bombs on starving people was presented as a solution â€“ that sounded really ridiculous. 11. Looking for new Earth in another Galaxy when your own offers millions of possibilities is like looking for new home on the other side of the planet when one just like it is next door. 12. The energy required to open or even enter a wormhole would be equivalent to the total of our Sun's output for a thousand years. Also, if you can place it next to Saturn then why not closer like next to Mars to make transporting humanity easier. 13. The wormhole as well as the blackhole would shed matter to subatomic particle size. Communicating through a wormhole. Whoever wrote that has no idea of the scale of problems. 14. Speaking of Mars it can be terraformed with a few H-bombs to release CO2 to warm the planet thus melting subsurface ice to give H20 thus oxygen. 15. Turning on and off hibernation is not like opening the fridge; too many opportunities to damage cells. 16. Underground centrifuge space station was constructed of massive concrete which has only compressive strength not tensile strength. 17. Centrifuge center had a Saturn type rocket (100m high) which when blasts off should destroy that whole complex. In reality a complex that large and built underground would bankrupt half the world. 18. Those quantum gravity equations would not fit on that small blackboard. And, why are they using a blackboard in a tech world capable of traveling easily through space? Surely they must have at least an iPad! 19. So, not explained was how love brought Cooper through multiple dimensions (possibly Universes) to the exact correct time & space that Murph happened to occupy. Probably because the writer couldn't. 20. TARS sounded military dumb and those legs are not designed for surviving uneven surfaces without damage, let alone running. 21. The film's ending of throwing papers, the Eureka and the anonymous kiss was typical Hollywoodish. 22. Ranger view of Earth did not show a devastated planet but normal cloud cover; normal water and land color. 23. Five dimensional space-time is decades old-hat. Seven, nine and for the past dozen years; eleven dimensions is now the most likely mathematical construct. Remember that's all this is - a construct. 24. The effort to push books off a shelf would either be equally the same in all dimensions or not possible so that extra effort shown was just dramatic invention. 25. The interweaving of 1990s cars and other old tech, such as lap tops, all simultaneous with space vehicles & stations not yet achievable for several more decades, didn't make sense - incongruous. 26. The alternate Earth being made habitable by altering some made-up chemistry between chlorine and ammonia and their relation to N2 didn't make planetary chemistry sense, especially since such a planet would be hundred thousand times more rare than the more abundant habitable planets; also most likely more than a -100 degrees below zero.

"This is not Movie, This is emotion",I will always regret that I could not see this film in the cinema,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"A Critical Analysis of ""Interstellar""","""Interstellar,"" directed by the renowned Christopher Nolan, is an epic science fiction film that deals with the themes of environmental collapse and interstellar travel. The story follows a future Earth facing ecological disaster, with Cooper (NASA pilot) leading a team of scientists on a cosmic odyssey through a wormhole. Their mission is to discover a new home for humanity, leading to encounters with time dilation, relativity, and the strangeness/puzzling way of the cosmos. Below, I have listed what I think are the film's key strengths:1. Performances: The cast, led by Matthew McConaughey's portrayal of Cooper, delivers performances that resonate on an emotional level. McConaughey's acting, along with Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, and other cast members, infuses the characters with depth and authenticity.2. Narrative: The film ventures into the realm of complex scientific concepts and seamlessly melds them with a profoundly human story. It interweaves themes of love, sacrifice, and the survival of humanity.3. Visuals: Christopher Nolan's directorial prowess, in conjunction with cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema, created a visual spectacle. The film's depiction of the cosmos, the intricate wormhole, and alien planets leaves an indelible impression. Notably, the reliance on practical effects over CGI amplifies the sense of immersion and makes it seem even more realistic.4. Brain Stimulation: ""Interstellar"" engages the audience with its exploration of advanced scientific concepts, including time dilation and the craziness that are black holes. It offers a unique and stimulating experience for those intrigued by science. This is great for someone like me that doesn't really like to sit and watch movies.5. Emotional Simulation: The film excels in evoking a spectrum of emotions, from heart wrenching separations to a profound sense of hope and human connection. The central father/daughter relationship adds a deeply personal layer to the grand cosmic story. To add to this, Hans Zimmer's musical score plays an instrumental role in intensifying the emotional impact of the film. The use of sound and silence within the vacuum of space amplifies the realism and tension in pivotal scenes.In summary, ""Interstellar"" is an amazing movie that breaks the rules of traditional sci-fi. It has great acting, creative direction, and explores important themes that will stick with you. The film blends science and storytelling well and makes you feel deep emotions, making it a true masterpiece. If you love sci-fi and movies that make you think and feel, you should definitely watch ""Interstellar.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A Cosmic Odyssey of Love and Sacrifice,"Christopher Nolan's ""Interstellar"" is a cinematic masterpiece that delves deep into the realms of space exploration, human survival, and the unbreakable bonds of love. With its breathtaking visuals and a hauntingly beautiful score by Hans Zimmer, the film takes audiences on a journey that is as much about the vastness of the universe as it is about the intimate connections between a father and his daughter.Set in a dystopian future where Earth is dying, the narrative follows a group of astronauts, led by the former pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), as they embark on a perilous mission through a wormhole near Saturn in search of a new home for humanity. The film beautifully juxtaposes the vast, cold expanse of space with the warmth of human emotions, making it a deeply moving experience.The scientific concepts, including black holes, time dilation, and the theory of relativity, are intricately woven into the plot, making ""Interstellar"" not just a visual spectacle but also a thought-provoking exploration of the mysteries of the universe. While some may argue that the film takes certain liberties with scientific accuracy, it's essential to remember that at its core, ""Interstellar"" is a work of fiction meant to entertain, inspire, and provoke thought.The performances are top-notch, with McConaughey delivering one of his career-best roles. Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, and Michael Caine also shine in their respective roles, bringing depth and authenticity to their characters.However, what truly sets ""Interstellar"" apart is its emotional depth. The film's exploration of love, sacrifice, and the passage of time resonates deeply, making it a tear-jerker for many. The relationship between Cooper and his daughter Murph (played by Mackenzie Foy and later by Jessica Chastain) is the beating heart of the story, and their emotional reunion is one of the most touching moments in cinematic history.In conclusion, ""Interstellar"" is a grand, ambitious, and emotionally charged film that pushes the boundaries of storytelling and filmmaking. It's a testament to Nolan's genius that he can craft a narrative that is both epic in scale and deeply personal in emotion. A must-watch for anyone who appreciates cinema that challenges, entertains, and moves the soul.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A sad blockbuster attempt at cinema,"You know those special movies that leave you with something more than you had before you watched them? They enrich you, teach you, show you. This isn't one of those.Interstellar is the pathetic result of a lot of bad ideas slamming together in Nolan's mind, falling out as broken disjointed garbled mush in the script.The script isn't the only problem with all of it's hammy hokum and lack of character. Even the heralded special effects are so clichÃ© at this point that they hardly add anything to this abyssal cavity of broken ideas.Here is what happened. Nolan saw some discovery channel show, or perhaps PBS, about the cosmos. He said to himself, ""I could make an adventure movie about that."" Unfortunately for those of us who recognize good cinema from average and just slop, he couldn't.I watch zero budget movies with more thoughtfulness than this two hundred million dollar nightmare.

"8,7/10? More like 7/10 for me.","A good science fiction film, but in my humble opinion it doesn't deserve this rain of 10/10 that I see on imdb and an 8.7 overall.

The music is very good too, I even had the impression that it carried the film to a certain point.The planets visited were a bit disappointing, I wish there was more to it than that. In all the infinity and unknown of space, there is no limit to the imagination and frankly, there hasn't been much.Movie was a little long at times, and the end, you kinda could see it coming. Theories about gravity were often weird.The rebellious father who doesn't care about the teachers' opinions when it comes to his son irritated me a little. I found him immature.I found that people didn't care a bit when other people of team died. ''Ah he's dead, dammit! Oh well, let's continue... It seems like we had more empathy for robots. The robots were still cool though.I found that there were a few easy jokes and a light atmosphere in difficult moments and it was a bit unrealistic. As much as the film was long, the beginning was very fast, almost too fast, with the random father who overnight becomes a potential hero to save the planet.At the end, it felt a bit like I was watching a weird Outer Limit scenario.

Nolan also does a masterful job of creating a sense of scale and scope, making the audience feel like they are on the journey with the astronauts. In addition to its visual effects, Interstellar is also a deeply emotional film. The story explores themes of love, loss, sacrifice, and the human spirit. The film's performances are also excellent, with McConaughey and Hathaway giving particularly standout performances.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A Science Fiction Masterpiece,"After watching this film over 5 times. Most recently just now, I cried. I don't really know why, but I did. Maybe it's just how I'm feeling today, but it made me weep. I have to admit, I saw it when it was first released and I liked it, but I have since compared it to my other Science Fiction favourites, such as Gravity and Arrival - the latter being my favourite Science Fiction film of all time. But, Christopher Nolan sees the art of film making from a totally different perspective, this film being a vehicle for his masterful imagination.I finally get it. This film makes me feel so small, yet connected to everything. The cinematography, the score, the acting is incredible. I will rewatch again and again, when I feel I the need to ground myself and realise how incredible and fragile life is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Christopher Nolan has done it again!!,"Intersellar. What Christopher Nolan has done so good with this movie was that he kept the plot simple,but we know that it's Christopher Nolan so it not going to be a simple movie. It's not. The overall plot is that the earth is dying so cooper(Matthew mcconaughey) and a team of scientists must go and find another place to live. The acting is great,what makes it so great is cooper and his daughter. Every time they were together it was WOW. The visuals were on another level. If you can,see it on the biggest screen possible. Some people may not like this movie because it talks a lot about science and many other things but you enjoy that, you will have a blast with this.Overall interstellar is a must see.

"Don't believe the hype, the pedigree","A decent movie with a lot of production values and star power but at the end is just too surrealistic. You'll hear all the usual imdb rants: magnificent, a triumph, a masterpiece but its all overblown. Slowing a movie down making it mysterious and putting the stakes so high only gets you so far.The movies starts well and who can't get enough of Anne Hathaway's gorgeous face but like the heralded soundtrack after a while it is overhelming.Not every Christopher Nolan movie is a masterpiece from frame to frame. Not every action or lack of action has earth shattering consequence. Sometime its just a highly produced and directed movie that should of had a fresh pair of eyes look at the script before it went into production.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Nearly 50 years to go nowhere.,"The premise here is relativity. Time vs gravity. The story, if there is one, is pointless. Christopher Nolan has surpassed Stanley Kubrick in making a visually stunning but ultimately pointless piece of Sci Fi nonsense. Nobody can give me a convincing explanation of 2001: A Space Odyssey, but in 1968 it was jaw dropping. Interstellar's problem is we've seen it all before, and Nolan is not Kubrick.Perhaps there is an analogy of the futility of life here, but it's spurious at best.This ranks with Prometheus as an incredibly beautiful waste of my time.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
This is a movie you want to tell everyone about but no matter what you say it's just not enough. Christopher Nolan is a genius,"""We're still pioneers. We've barely begun. Our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us because our destiny lies above us."" Mankind has finally used up all of Earth's resources and it has become a dying planet. When Cooper (McConaughey) and his daughter stumble upon a secret outpost that contains the remnants of NASA they are told of the seriousness of the problem facing humanity. Cooper is a former astronaut and is given the responsibility of traveling into space to find a habitable planet for the human race. I have been writing these little reviews for almost 5 years now and for the most part I have found it easy to talk about every movie. This one I can't seem to find the right words for. The reason has less to do with my vocabulary and more to do with the awesomeness of the movie. There are some movies that words just cannot do justice to. The last one I felt that way about was The Passion Of The Christ. This is a movie you want to tell everyone about but no matter what you say it's just not enough. I loved Gravity and this was 1,000 times better. Overall, really nothing I can say about this movie other than watch it. Christopher Nolan is a genius.

Interstellar - Truly Symphonic Creation by the Nolans,"A simply breathtaking film, Interstellar completely blew my expectations out of the water. The Nolan brothers took a huge risk in making a film about space travel, but they succeeded.The movie was one of the most visually stimulating movies I've ever watched. Be prepared to stare in awe. Hans Zimmer didn't disappoint with his original scores for the movie as well. Just wave after wave of amazing CGI and music throughout the film is enjoyable just by itself.But what I enjoyed most was the fact that the movie sticks to the main theme of human survival and curiosity. Everything that happens always links back to those themes.Not everyone will like the movie; some of the plot twists and more bizarre explanations the Nolan brothers came up with will leave some laughing, confused, mad, and/or skeptical. After all, it is a movie on the unknown. But, the Nolan brothers outdid themselves. You have to understand that there is so much in space physics and astronautics that humans cannot even fathom. You have to understand that what the Nolan brothers came up with could be true or not be true; there's no way to know because they came up the best interpretation for the movie based on incomplete data.TL;DR, one of the best movies made ever so go watch it. go in with an open mind and accept that humans do not know everything about space.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"Combining ENTER THE VOID, THE LAST MIMSEY and Â….. GENESIS","Not so much film as much as strange milestone for Hollywood.With A-List stars and a final running length of about 3 hours.This in an age where Hollywood is so desperate for profit and fast turnover that even TV shows have more commercials and less content.How is this possible? Easy answer: Nolan Brothers. Look in a mirror, say those names 7 times quickly, the Hollywood Rule Book disappears.The bizarre length effectively gives the viewer not one but three entirely separate movies joined only by the title.This reviewer in particular was gob-smacked by the first movie, effectively from the beginning until the space flight, and wanted to jump to an alternate universe where the whole movie took place in that small town, post-apocalyptic setting. With the dust. And stray drones. And the school teachers who taught that the trip to the moon was just propaganda.I cannot over-emphasize how strange this is. Even though that was not the point of the film, I suggest the production company unintentionally created (in that first hour) the best sci-fi future-world ambiance in the history of film; and, unaware of what they had accidentally done, they just moved on.BTW, a number of futurists have said that in the early part of the 21st century the odds favor at least one major volcano going ""super,"" or blowing for extended days or weeks. This will place ash/dust in the air will will cover the planet. Until this film, I never saw the image of what this might look like. Now I know. Wow.)The second film is like every Star Trek film you have ever seen, but by way of Stanley Kubrick. Not bad, but nowhere near as much fun as the first portion, Another really really cool thing is the robot that resembles one of those ladder kits you buy at Home Depot, that can form a variety of shapes. Ultra cool.Until you finally get to the third and final movie (or Act) which is meant to have profound spiritual implications but in reality only works if you have been paying careful attention for the first two and a half hoursÂ…. Which is itself a strange contradiction.But the whole film is full of contradictions. There is an Epilogue too (following the unstated theme of three Acts and an Epilogue). It is fun, it is moving, it connects with the viewer, and it makes no sense at all. There are plot holes in the Epilogue that you could lose a Black Hole in. Joke intended.So, there you go, one of the oddest and most contradictory films of all time.Oh, don't even bother trying to figure out how a society that can develop AI to a degree beyond anything ever seen in film before (the Costco ladder people) still has teachers that dispute the Moon Landing and doctors who can't deal with a cough.As I keep saying, a very strange movie.But a very powerful one*** REVIEW UPDATED OCT 2016****Greetings from the year 2016. For those reading this from the far future when everyone who wishes it has instant access to the IMDb database, probably beamed right into the cortex, I am updating my review with this addenda: I confess I missed the point of the film on first viewing. After all, this is a Nolan Bros 3 hr opus which, sadly, never really achieved a proper audience and now is more or less lost to time, much like the characters in the story. On second viewing, I ""got"" that this is basically a love story set against a sci-fi backdrop. The love of a father for his daughter, the growth of Man to a new dimensional experience where love itself is quantifiable - these are amazing concepts and this is an amazing movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Most overrated movie in mankind's history!,"This is the movie that proves what many people by now have already realized: People are being payed to write 10 stars fake reviews! Let me tell you this: This movie is really NOT that great!First, it's too long. It takes one hour just for the space mission to start.It's slow paced and VERY sentimental, or, in other words, most of it is boring.I'm not an English native speaker, but my English is not bad either. I have no problems watching movies in English, and yet it was very hard for me to understand the main character's mumbling in his farmer accent. All other actors spoke properly, except him, the most important one.The plot is not very logical: Planets just in front of a giant black hole?! Yes, this must be the place to live everybody is dreaming of.Imagine your colleagues in the space station would say to you: ""OK, we're now ready to fly down to that planet. You wait here. Don't worry, we'll come back soon, in... some YEARS!"" You'd probably smile and say: ""Wonderful! OK, go now!"", right? One day they come back and are probably surprised to see you haven't committed suicide because of depression, even though you waited 23 years (!!!) for them. You must be the most patience man in the entire Universe.And again a female ""scientist"" who looks like a model and behaves like an amateur. An obligatory part of every sci-fi movie nowadays.This is just to give you an idea. There is much more, so read the other negative reviews.Good night.

This is not a Movie. This is an 'Experience',"There used to be movies where the purpose of it might be giving entertainment, educating or enlightening them. But apart from most of the movies, 'Interstellar' is more than that. It is not a movie. You never realize that you spent 2 hrs 40 mins in the theater. It blends with you. It makes you a third person in the lives of the character watching then to go through all the experiences they have.This is not a movie, this is an absolute experience that everyone should experience. It educates you, It questions you wit to the maximum level possible (How many of you understand quantum physics and Wave theory?) It raises an in-numerous questions even to the researchers who are the top in this domain, Is that possible? The answer is yes and no at the same time. For believers, it is possible as explains the paradoxes and decodes how it is possible and for non-believers, there are always questions that cant be answered.Apart for science, the human connections are stupendous. It makes you to connect emotional not just to a character but to the future of the earth.And the best part in the movie is subtlety in the picturing it. There is enormous possibility of making it more of a scifi journey showing colorful planets etc etc. But Nolan used what is required without going for too much unnecessary visual elevations.The science, emotions, story & the screenplay are the best in the movie.It is an experience that everyone should experience.

Nolan's best movie and surely one of the best of all time.,"An unmissable date for any science fiction fan. Nolan reaches limits rarely seen and is on par with Kubrick or Andrei Tarkovski in terms of his representation. Matthew McConaughey is incredible and it may be one of the few Nolan films where there are strong female characters who make themselves known. It is a visual and sound journey, because yes, the soundtrack is one of the best we can see from Hans Zimmer (and I think that says a lot).The level that Nolan reaches to get to this point is incredible, how everything is there, the scientific, it is plausible, it is credible. Although sometimes he may be arrogant and intellectual, I do not consider that he is making fun of the fans, it is all there, all the time.It convinces me from beginning to end and despite its length I would watch it a thousand times.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Pretty good. But not that good.,"I could not wait to find a cinema that showed this movie, especially after two of my close friends went as far as to saying that it was beyond a doubt one of the best movies of all time. Honestly, I don't think it's the case. It will be one of the top movies of the year but that's about it. Christopher Nolan seems to feel the need to explain to us every single thing that happens, every step of the way so we don't get lost. It becomes a little annoying as the movie progresses. Another thing that makes this movie lose a couple of points is that hippie conversation around the half way point, where Anne Hathaway says something along the lines of ""nothing is more powerful than love"". Please! Get serious! On the positive side, the last few minutes of the movie are quite spectacular visually. Probably better than Gravity.All in all, considering the type of movies that get done these days, Interstellar is definitely one to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Incredible,"It may very well be the most remarkable film I've ever seen. Interstellar is a film which plays on your emotions more than anything else. Many people get caught up in the plot holes and the scientific inaccuracies, and thus, let these factors detract from what would otherwise be an incredible cinematic experience. Interstellar is a film to completely surrender yourself to - and let the sheer grandiosity and emotionality move you. Forget logic, forget science. This is art in its most fantastical and overwhelming form. A father's heart breaks as he realizes he's broken his daughter's heart - He has left her and does not know when he'll return. Nolan pulls every string in our heart with the emotion of the father- daughter relationship set against the backdrop of interstellar travel to save the human race.

Any father, especially with a daughter, would understand what I mean! :) It's pure gold.I have a very close relationship with my little daughter, we are best friends, in some way similar to that of Interstellar, and I've always tried to prioritize it, but I find myself always learning something new from Cooper and Murph.As a huge sci-fi fan, I'll even completely ignore the sci-fi part in this review! :))",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Worst Christopher Nolan Movie Ever,"When I first saw previews of the movie, I thought it looked really sappy and unappealing. But then I saw it was a Christopher Nolan movie and I thought it had to be good. I love all his movies: Batman, The Prestige, INCEPTION. He's made so many great movies, I thought there was no way it could be that bad... well it was.The movie starts out and the premise just makes no sense. I don't understand what humanity's problem is in this movie. Humans survived for literally 100s of thousands of years before farming was invented, but all of sudden we're all going to die just because we can't grow wheat and okra anymore. It isn't explained satisfactorily at all. People have cars and electricity, but they can't have an MRI machine? MRI machines are not that hard to build. The world of Interstellar makes no sense and they don't even try to explain it.But the biggest problem is that the movie is boring, so very boring. We start out on this boring farm. I couldn't wait for the main characters to leave this boring planet, but they just dragged it out with the sappiness and the ""please don't go!"" There are so many scenes that just seem to pointlessly drag on and make you wonder why the editor dropped the ball so much.Then when go off into space it gets a lot more exciting... some of the time. Thinking about grativity, and relativistic time effects is pretty cool, but this is puncuated with some odd interpersonal conflicts that don't really play out in a compelling or sensical way.For some reason Hollywood has decided that romantic relationships aren't compelling anymore. That sort-of makes sense, it's kind of silly when movies are about two people who just met and then all of sudden they fall in love and are willing to kill and die for each other. But they have replaced romantic relationships in movies with something less compelling: boring, undeveloped relationships. The main character has a son and a daughter, but for some reason the father doesn't seem to care that much about his son, and instead the movie revolves around his relationship with the daughter. But honestly, I did not care about them. None of the characters were particularly interesting or likable. You could replace the actors with any other big name actors it would not have made much of a difference.There was so much in the movie that I just plain old didn't understand. A lot of scenes in the movie that were supposed to be exciting and suspenseful just fell flat, because I had no idea what was I was supposed to be rooting for or afraid of happening. Much of it isn't exciting because of the fundamental nature of what is going on on screen... like watching someone trying to figure out the answer to an equation, while some dramatic music plays. That's just not exciting.The worst parts of the movie, besides the nonsense and plot holes, was the weak philosophizing on the nature of love and its relationship to science, and that kind of thing. Blah blah blah evolution, survival instincts. The movie does has depth, but when the characters go off on some philosophical exposition it just comes off as pretentious and shallow. They never make a single point about love that is even slightly original or though-provoking.But the movie isn't all bad. I like the Robot AI character. The movie had some unique visuals and situations that are memorable, they should have been used in a better movie...And so in conclusion, this movie is okay. I'd recommend it if you have nothing better to watch.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

The most stupid science fiction of these days,"To explain my daring title - I'd like this review to be a counterbalance to many over-enthusiast appraisals.Yes, it is a good action/drama. Yes, it is a spectacular science-fiction film. Every genre fan's dream: travelling among different worlds (though, try to watch Europa report!), bending the laws of ""common sense"" newtonian physics and playing with blackholes and wormholes (the space-bending explanation is just a shameless ""borrowing"" from much older Event Horizon).Though, this movie betrays the ""common sense"" in yet another way. its plot. ""We have destroyed this Earth, let's find another one."" Irresponsibility, anyone? while we may argue - if this is not a premise of every beloved pot-apocalyptic distopia, if ""space travel"" is not what we want from science-fiction at the end of the day ... this movie dared to start with really hot topic, so boldly that it should be judged by its own ""higher standards"".So we have an ecosystem collapse in the beginning - It is quite obvious that the reason of it are monocultures stretching towards the horizon - a direct consequence of machist, industrial, technocratic approach to science, progress, planet, life, agriculture, thinking... The root cause is so clearly visible in every picture frame of the down-on-Earth part of the movie - but the only ""solution"" offered by the writer(s) is again the technocratic one: ""Let's build super complex machines to transport us zillion light years away"" ... instead of simple (!) cheap (!!) responsible (!!!) fixing of the darned monoculture issue down on our original planet.While many claim that this movie is sophisticated if not even intellectual - it is not - it is actually offensive to the intellect. There might be many of the-good-old space travel operas, whom I would forgive this and spare them the ""common sense"" critique. But not Interstellar - because it pretends that it is ""aware"", ""eco-conscious"", it pretends that it urges us to think about our relationship towards the planet, but it fails exactly in this point.

Maybe audiences have lost the notion of quality, story-line, plot, acting, and uniqueness - as this movie doesn't have any of it.

If you don't want to scratch your head for 169mins.. READ THIS.!,"Yup Nolan did it again and this time he has taken his movie to another dimension.!!'Interstellar' is the story of a man trying to save his family and then saving humanity from extinction. Its full of space adventure and breath-taking actions on some of the most beautiful and unrealistic locations around the UNIVERSE.To realize Nolan's master-piece it Is better if polish our ideas about space-time theory. We know space is defined in 3 dimensions and Einstein in his theory of relativity uses Time as the 4th dimension. But Scientists in the movie realize that Gravity has the tendency to flow across all these 4 dimensions and thus Gravity is designated to be the Fifth Dimension. It is believed that whoever holds to understand and master the knowledge of this 5 dimensions will be able to move anywhere in Time and Space. In this movie a certain species referred as ""THEY"" has the knowledge of this five dimensions and it is THEM who wants Humans to save themselves.In the film various Scientific and Astronomical theories are used, and it will help if viewers have a brief idea about them too.Murphy's law- It is an adage or epigram that is typically stated as: Anything that can go wrong will go wrong. A statement relating possibilities with Certainty.Worm hole- It is a bridge, a hypothetical topological feature of space-time that would fundamentally be a shortcut through space-time. A wormhole is much like a tunnel with two ends, each in separate points in space-time. Though undiscovered, Some believe that wormhole could be used to travel through galaxies.Black hole- It is a region of space-time from which gravity prevents anything, including light, from escaping. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Inside the hole what happens is still a mystery, and that's where Nolan's creativity brings about.The movie is filled with unproved theories and unrealistic scenarios. But the way Nolan has directed it, you wont want to blink you eyes even for a moment. The graphics are, no doubt, marvelous. The cast did a stupendous job and . Though laws has been broken to keep the ending sweet, it is well deserved as LOVE has no rules and no dimensions.Conclusion: Watch it again and again.. and it gets better and better.!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Possibly the greatest film of this decade, maybe even century (so far).","Similar to at least one of my fellow reviewers, this is my first review.

I was blown away by the beauty and grandeur of Kubrick's masterpiece, and I was worried that seeing it so soon before ""Interstellar"" would lead me to great disappointment in Nolan's film. Fortunately, this is NOT the case. ""Interstellar"" lived up to Kubrick's ""Odyssey"" and will be one of my favorite movies of all time. Nolan's movie certainly didn't surpass ""Odyssey""; the two occupy a very different space (no pun intended) in my mind and in the annals of cinema. I can say with confidence that the two of these movies have illustrated the glory of what can be achieved in a sci-fi film, and they cause all others to pale in comparison. Even the recently- released and acclaimed ""Gravity"" has no such weight compared to these two masterpieces (another great pun).Without spoiling any of the film, I would like to discuss some details that impressed me. The score is phenomenal, the acting is powerful, and the special effects are superb. But perhaps my favorite aspect of the movie are the apparent nods to Kubrick's ""Odyssey"" which made the dual-experience even more significant. Certain elements of the film reminded me of Kubrick's ""Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite"" sequence, the mysterious monoliths, even the legendary HAL-9000. Even with these slight similarities, so much of the movie was different, and in enough ways bolder, such that ""Interstellar"" feels incredibly fresh and original.Christopher Nolan co-wrote AND directed this film, which only further solidifies his status as one of the greatest directors of our generation. Even with his hard-to-match lineup of prior successes, this movie is a phenomenal standout. The run-time felt very appropriate, and just like ""Odyssey,"" I was pleased with how many things were addressed after what seemed like logical stopping points.Please treat yourself to a theater experience of ""Interstellar."" If you love sci-fi, if you love the realities of space and astronomy, even if you only love great film making, you will love this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"weak storyline, this film is over-rated.","i was expecting to see an exciting sci-fi film which will keep you watching till the end due to its high rating, but it was a disappointment.it has several problems in no particular order.1. the robot's design is too simple and ugly. it was basically a square with a computer screen in it. if people can send spaceship beyond the moon, shouldn't the robots have more functions? this ugly robot doesn't even have two hands. it can't really do anything other than talking.2. the robot's voice sounds just like matt damon. i thought that they want to save money, so they just used the same actor. it made the film sounded cheap.3. cooper the character didn't do anything scientific, all of sudden, he was flying a spaceship into the deep space? that didn't make sense.4. lack of asians. in 2016, black people are protesting lack of ""diversity"" in Oscar, this film didn't have any Asian faces in it. there are more Asian scientists than blacks . this film failed to hire Asian actors.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Science fact meets science theory meets science fiction,"Christopher Nolen rides again with this massive scale sci-if journey story that braids cutting edge special effects, amazing performances and a supremely inventive story together to make what is sure to be one of the year's landmark films. The movie stars Matthew McConaughey as Cooper, a NASA astronaut forced to become a farmer in a world where earth's natural resources have dwindled down to nearly nil. As Cooper struggles to raise his children during what seems to be humanity's final throws, a team of scientists, headed by Nolen favorites Michael Caine, Anne Hathaway and David Gyasi, put together a daring plan to save humanity by searching for new inhabitable world's beyond our galaxy and require Cooper's skill to get them there.I really dug the hell out of this movie. As a fan of space travel myself, I really have to say that they did a great job at capturing a lot of the real math and science theory behind space travel, relativity theory and even some of the more edgy ideas about the characteristics of black holes. It's clear that the Nolen brothers Christopher and Jonathen did their homework while writing this script. The performances are also quite good here and Jessica Chastaine, who plays Cooper's grownup daughter, is especially impressive. These things married with the IMAX scope and the bigger than life special effects make this movie an absolute joy to watch. Everything is not all aces here as the film is not without its faults. Perhaps the thing I had the most problem with was the film's third act. The movie spends a long time setting up a very real and for the most part, a scientifically sound universe that is on par with 2001: A Space Odyssey and even to some degree it makes fun of a tropish, nonsensical and dumb way that the story could end as if to say, ""we're smarter than that, c'mon, what do you take us for?"" only to give in and end it that way anyway. At first I was OK with it but the more that I look at the film, the less the ending makes sense and the more the film starts to eat itself which was needless to say, really disappointing.Overall, I still liked the movie and despite my issues with the third act, I recommend it, and if you can, spring for the IMAX because the scope and scale of the visuals are ridiculous! No television could ever do it justice. This film is for sure to be in talks to win an award of some kind for special effects in the coming months and it's well deserved. If you love liked Gravity or 2001: A Space Odyssey or Apollo 13, you are sure to like this too. Interstellar gets a 3.5...out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Uh.....I Just Don't Get This At All.,"How this travesty of a ""sci-fi"" movie has garnered so many gilded reviews is proof that either A) I am way out of step with the great, unwashed movie-going masses or B) the aforesaid masses have never seen a truly great ""sci-fi"" flick. This movie was interminable; I almost walked out 38 minutes into the run, when Mathew was still just a former test pilot trapped in the body of a corn-huskin' farmer.Which leads me to my first problem with Interstellar: would you ""hire"" a corn-huskin' farmer and devoted Dad of 2 to be the pilot of an intergalactic space mission? Aside from 1 or 2 very brief allusions, there is ZERO explanation / justification for Matt to be selected for this mission. And strangely enough, Michael Caine ages not 1 day in the 23 years since Matt blasts off for ""strange new worlds"".He is still in the same pants and shirt as he was when Matt blasted off (23 years before); the directors did give Mike a wheelchair for good measure. Before I proceed, there were 2 or 3 somewhat interesting plot twists, and the CGI / special FX were very good (just like ""Gravity"", another recent ""sci-fi"" disappointment); although the robot was utterly ridiculous; more like a walkin', talking' 21st century soda machine or a ""Gen 12"" Robbie the Robot.Of course, CGI and special FX alone do not a classic ""sci-fi"" film make. I cannot disclose 2 major plot disappointments due to the ""spoiler"" clause but suffice it to say the powers behind this film have tried to fuse an entry level class in quantum physics with an action film; and it just didn't work.I have now accepted, grudgingly, that for enough money you can get the finest actors to play in the most ludicrous films. Read the cast list; scratch your heads in disbelief, along with me. And if you want a classic ""sci-fi"" movie? Try 2001, Blade Runner, and Alien.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

This movie transcends space & time,"Back in 2014 when only few selected cities in India had the privilege of IMAX screens, in order to watch this film in a regular theatre, I had to take a train journey to another state. And I did it twice.Now after 10 years, finally I got chance to watch this sci-fi epic as it is meant to be i.e., in an IMAX screen. The cinematic experience was unbelievable right from the beginning till the end credits. Even Avatar didn't had such an impact the way this Nolan's masterpiece has while viewing on the big screen.Be it the cast, storytelling, cinematography or background score, this sci-fi masterpiece has every ingredient that will leave you in awe when the credits roll. Matthew McConaughey as Cooper is superb in his role of an ex-NASA pilot turned farmer in a dystopian future where the Earth has become uninhabitable. Cooper's chemistry with his daughter Murph is heartwarming that will leave you in tears on multiple occasions. This is something new from Nolan who in his previous creations never really fixated his characters in such emotional things. Music by Zimmer is on another level and makes every scene a memorable one especially the Cornfield Chase, the Docking Sequence and that timer on the Miller's Plant. Even writing about these gives me chills. Not to mention the detailing of every scientific term to make it easy for audience to understand the concept is something that needs to be acknowledged. The amount of time Nolan invested with the likes of Nobel award winning scientist Dr. Kip Thorne to make this movie so close to realism is something that has never been done before.Planning to watch every time it is re-released.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A visually epic film,"Interstellar marks Christopher Nolan's return to the silver screen since ending his Dark Knight trilogy. While Interstellar seems like classic Nolan, it also feels as if he wanted to focus on making the most realistic space film even if the story fell casualty. And it most certainly seems this way. Interstellar has the best effects that I've ever seen in a film. Each shot detailing the vacancy of space, and the planets that orbit gently is so well crafted that it almost makes you forget about the story flaws in the film. While that does remain as a huge advantage that this film has, it also doesn't delude the fact that there are some pretty glaring issues regarding Nolan's story and its characters. The story behind the film starts off as the unlikely hero is tasked with saving the planet...then it starts talking about space and the relation of time and space. While spoon feeding the audience isn't exactly Nolan's forte, it does begin to start sounding like a physics class in some scenes as characters spout off information as if it is supposed to be common knowledge. But, as Nolan intended, this is most definitely not your typical popcorn blockbuster. Interstellar demands multiple viewings and echoes early Stanley Kubrick in style and in pacing but one thing that has kept me from giving this film a higher rating is most definitely the characters. Christopher Nolan can certainly deliver us a GREAT film, his filmography speaks for itself, but Interstellar is one of his few films that features very little in the way of good characters. Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway certainly delivered the goods here in regards to their performances, but their characters themselves were very flawed and not well rounded in the least. Their characters are there, strictly to progress the story when it begins to slow down and with a running time of nearly three hours, it certainly does drag in certain scenes. However, despite it feeling long and bloated, the imagery here is more than enough to captivate you. The technical aspects of this film are EXTRAORDINARY. Everything from the beautiful, flawless cinematography to the robust sound design, everything here is utterly flawless on a technical level. It makes for a truly engrossing theater experience, if nothing else. Overall, Interstellar feels like a film that is bound to divide audiences and while I didn't love the film outright, there's a lot to this film to admire and appreciate.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Wonderful,I have already lost count of the times I have seen this movie and I am still fascinated by the beautiful soundtrack and the immensity of each frame,9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
To the stars - away from the common sense!,"This year is not very good for the sci-fi cinematography. Besides multiple unintentional parodies of the genre (like X-Men: Days of Future Past), there was actually only one big-budget movie worth watching: On the Edge of Tomorrow. It seems like Tom Cruise is one of the few Hollywood stars able to wisely pick roles. His recent achievements leave little to desire: Valkyrie, or Knight and Day are good at worst, with the high pitch of Oblivion. Are we able to say the same about Matthew McConaughey?Unfortunately, not. Although his recent movies are above average (True Detective or Dallas Buyers Club), the latest picture he plays in, Interstellar (directed by Christopher Nolan and written by him and his brother), is a huge letdown and misunderstanding. I don't think anyone being fond of ""hard"" science-fiction stories will like it. Here is why.Firstly, the story. It is in general similar to Mission to Mars or The Red Planet, where the handful of daredevils are put in the spaceship to venture on a mission, which result will impact the whole human race. Unfortunately, which is the usual problem in this case, the whole plot is neither engaging, nor entertaining. We have a bunch of uninteresting people making uninteresting things in space. Maybe because of the long time span of the picture, the viewer quickly gets bored and does not care about the main characters. Besides, the space adventure is mixed with the very personal story of the father trying to save his children (which is also a time-consuming thread here). Anyway, the main conclusion of Interstellar is the banal statement that ""love is the most important thing in the world"". Do we really need to sit for almost three hours in the cinema to get this?By coincidence, the second problem is the length of the movie. Currently, when the the picture is recorded not on the tape, but in the digital medium, every director tries to surpass his rivals by creating as long movie as possible. Maybe it is supposed to be the emblem of his might, skills or wisdom? I have no idea, but the fact is that the contemporary blockbusters are difficult to watch especially because they last for three or more hours, having the plot for only half of this time. This is exactly the case with Interstellar. The presented story is far from complex, and could easily fit in two hours. In fact, the first forty minutes of the movie have nothing to do with the rest of the story and could be recapitulated by the narrator in two sentences...This film tries to treat the topic of interstellar travel seriously. Unfortunately, some ideas are presented according to our current knowledge of physics and astronomy, while others are just stupid. This mixture makes the suspension of disbelief, necessary to enjoy such movie, impossible to attain. On one side we have wormholes, black holes, higher dimensions of space and the silence of the void. On the other hand, there is totally unconvincing reality of the XXI century, where farmers are more valuable than engineers (guys, really?) and tomography is (mysteriously) gone. In one scene the physicist explains convincingly the work regime of the wormhole (by the way, this scene is IDENTICAL to the one from the far better Event Horizon). In another, we see the mission robot TARS, being the member of the crew. I know that humanoid machines from fifties seem ridiculous today (like the one from The Day The Earth Stood Still), but they are really the top quality idea compared to the robots depicted in Interstellar. It is difficult to believe someone created such a model and the whole crew agreed to put it the picture! It's almost like the the wooden planet from the initial script of Alien 3...The number of errors and non-logical events is just amazing. Anyone complaining about the lack of consistency in Prometheus (which was also much better than this one) will have the real hunting ground here. In fact, the more time passes after seeing the movie, the more nonsenses are detected. Don't think about this too much, anyway, its not worthy...The Nolan brothers used their imagination a little bit too much in the final part of the story, where the word ""magic"" (interchangeable with ""nonsense"") comes to mind. As the result, the viewer is left at the end indifferent to what is presented on the screen and does not care about the fate of the characters... Please recall the infamous Black Hole, and You will have the impression of what is going on here...The music is of course the extremely important part of every picture. If the composer knows his craft, the soundtrack complements the images, creating the flawless combo (as was in Terminator, Starship Troopers, Aliens, etc.). Here we have the attempt to create the epic atmosphere, but the events shown on screen are rather uninteresting, therefore the resulting impression is just the overwhelming noise, making the viewer angry instead of touching or moving him.Unfortunately, it seems like making a good movie about the interstellar travel is extremely difficult. People like to go to the movies and see a good story. There are multiple requirements for the entertaining movie: the mystery, the convincing scenery, the real characters we could care about, finally, the emotional strain, often related to the dangers our protagonists are exposed to. Interstellar does not offer anything of these. It is a long and boring sermon about the future of Mankind in the universe, pretending to be the science-fiction movie. With this picture Christopher Nolan proved his only memorable work was Prestige and the Batman trilogy was not the accident, but the clear sign that his main achievements in Hollywood will be too long, boring and utterly disappointing pictures, initially rising hopes for a good time spent in the cinema, but leaving in a complete, sad disillusion after all.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"My All-Time Favorite Movie, Revisited","My number one, all-time favorite movie. I just saw the 10th Anniversary Edition in IMAX, and wow. It still blows me away.Everything about this film just works for me. The story is epic, spanning vast distances of space and time, yet it's also deeply personal. It explores big questions about humanity's place in the universe, our survival instinct, and the very nature of time itself.Seeing the vastness of space on the massive IMAX screen was breathtaking. The planets, the galaxies, the black hole - all rendered with such incredible detail and realism. It truly feels like you're journeying alongside the characters, experiencing the wonder and the terror of the unknown. The sound design is equally impressive, creating a truly immersive and visceral experience. From the rumbling of the rocket launches to the eerie silence of deep space, the soundscape perfectly complements the visuals.But what truly elevates Interstellar for me is its emotional core. The relationship between Cooper and Murph is the heart of the film, and it's what makes the story so emotionally resonant.Interstellar isn't just a science fiction movie; it's a movie about hope, about love, and about the enduring power of the human spirit.

Sappy Sentimentality and Silly Science,"'Memento' and 'Inception' had some problems, but their ideas stretched the imagination. 'Interstellar' only delivers the vacuous pretension one would expect if a Batman director thought he could eclipse Kubrick's '2001' with an implausible adventure story. Christopher Nolan's new film begins inauspiciously and steadily declines as its long-winded prologue introduces the Hollywoodian elements of a Steven Spielberg/Norman Rockwell Sci-Fi co-production - a widowed ex-astronaut farmer, his chiseled jaw, a feisty daughter, a crusty grandpa, baseball, dust storms, a dying Earth, paranormal activity, cornfields - and lots of corn.After about an hour - which seems like two - a valiant crew lifts off in search of a planet to save humanity. Once they've journeyed through an interstellar wormhole, the far-fetched nature of the tale expands to cosmic levels. Nolan's need to overwhelm his audience with awesomeness is so powerful that he forgets to tell a believable story. Scientific hocus-pocus is stirred into the sentimental sludge as gigantic tsunamis, frozen planets, deranged scientists, spaceship chases, time travel tomfoolery and black hole baloney eventually lead to a schmaltzy Hallmark-level climax. The visual effects are above average, but diminished by the cheesy melodrama of the narrative. When all the film's 'Sturm und Drang' has died away, self-importance and mawkishness are the abiding impressions.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Every time I watch it, I find myself thinking about the universe and our place in it, making it a film that's not just about what happens on screen, but also what it leaves you thinking about afterward.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"It doesn't all work, but it is beautiful in its efforts","I'd heard fairly mixed things about this film, and often heard praise for elements that I think one shouldn't lead with, so I did put off seeing it until very recently. The reason for this mixed reaction I guess if that it is a very mixed bag of a film, and I can see why people love it, hate it, and a bit of both. The plot sees a series of unexplained events bringing a farmer and former pilot into a group looking to save humanity from the earth, which is currently killing itself and threatening to take mankind with it. Looking to the stars, in particular a black hole which seems to have been placed nearby to allow for travel to much more distant worlds, he learns of previous missions to scout out other planets on the other side, and that he is needed to lead a mission to follow up the promising leads, leaving his family behind potentially forever.To get it out of the way, there is a lot not to like about the film. It runs very long, and at some points this almost seems deliberate â€“ like it has to be a certain length to be able to be called an epic. It also has variable pacing and plotting across this time, with some elements not making logical sense without even having to nitpick on technical details. However, while it doesn't all come together, the film is no less beautiful for what it does while it is trying to do it all. The visual effects are stunning, with believable space travel and worlds created, to the point that although a lot of it is technobabble, you do tend to go along with it and accept everything being laid out. Just as important as the technical, visionary stuff, is that the film has a very human heart throughout. It is surprisingly emotional, even when in the context of pure sci-fi elements; you do tend to buy characters as people, with their flaws, their pain, their motivations â€“ it is surprising how strong the film is in this regard.Part of this working is that the performances are universally strong, although to just pick one â€“ Mathew McConaughey is really great throughout. His down-to-earth elements bring the viewer into the film, while he completely nails the emotional content, which again helps convince us of the reality of the situation and passage of time â€“ because we see how it hits his character, so it must be real. The director marshals all this in a feast for the eyes, heart, and brain â€“ it doesn't all work, like I say, and it is far from being the perfect, flawless film that some would suggest, but it is engaging, thoughtful, heartfelt, and very well made.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Made for IMAX,"""Movies are meant to be watched on the big screen"" is a saying I disagree with. Most of the time, I prefer my home setup. My 4K TV usually provides better visuals, and my headphones actually let me hear what the actors are saying, instead of the dialogue being a bassy garble. The best part, I don't have to deal with inconsiderate people talking during the movie or lighting up my peripheral vision with their phones.That said, I do make the exception for IMAX. No home theater setup can replicate the sheer immersive experience of watching a film shot on IMAX cameras, in the format it was designed for.Interstellar is the best movie ever made for IMAX.I recently saw Interstellar in IMAX for its 10th anniversary. It was my second time experiencing it in IMAX, the first being its original release. Back then, I sat in the front row and didn't fully appreciate the movie or the format. This time, I was blown away.My God! Interstellar doesn't just play on the screen; it engulfs you. The breathtaking visuals and bone-rattling sound design make it an unparalleled cinematic experience. Forget gimmicks like DBOX-IMAX's sound engineering alone makes you feel every vibration and shake of the spacecraft. The vastness of space, the colossal scale of planets, and the beauty of the black hole-is breathtaking on the ginormous screen.The docking sequence, paired with Hans Zimmer's No Time for Caution, is pure cinematic magic. The soaring organ, the pounding bass, and the visceral sense of motion-it's not just a scene; it's a full-body experience. It's one of the most unforgettable moments I've ever had as a movie fan.While IMAX undoubtedly enhances the experience, it's not the main reason the movie is so great. Interstellar is a masterpiece on its own. Its story is original, emotional, and inspiring. The acting is exceptional, with heartfelt performances that ground the film's bold sci-fi premise. The soundtrack, cinematography, and special effects are among the best ever crafted for the screen. And despite its nearly three-hour runtime, it keeps you riveted with a perfect balance of tense action, tear-jerking moments, and thought-provoking themes.Interstellar is a celebration of classic epics like Lawrence of Arabia and 2001: A Space Odyssey, drawing inspiration from their awe inspiring visuals and epic score. Like those films, it will be remembered as a cinematic achievement.Put simply, Interstellar is meant to be watched on the big screen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Insane,"The movie is a true masterpiece. From the advanced renderings of the galaxy to the soundtrack, everything in this movie is just mind blowingly good.

Wow, tears and intensity, all the way through to the other side.I am compelled to write more, but what can I say, it's all in the film, go see it.

outstanding film,"Interstellar is massive in scope. Intellectually, and in vision. Space travel that pushes the limits of mankind's abilities. Jessica Chastain is great as she usually is.Matthew Mccaughnay (spelled terribly wrong) was a quite moving and motivated character.the desire he had to save his family but at the same time not forget his responsibility to humanity, was, for the lack of a better phrase, wonderfully noble. The ability to see beyond self is a quality sorely lacking in the real world we live in.Ann Hathaway s character too was believable.a reminder that love can move us to do amazing things no matter the cost. And also see the need to fulfill whatever is asked of us for the greater good.the scientific aspects of this movie will confuse some, it is beyond detailed.and since I'm not an astrophysicist or astronaut, I don't quite understand it all. However the plausibility of it all makes minds wonder and imagine great things about space travel. Lastly, the military a.i. that was used throughout the film was good.funny, personable, believable, and pretty awesome.everyone played their role and played it well.in my heart of hearts 10 out of 10.a film that will pull your heart strings",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Largely Over-hyped, Laboriously Flawed","I really wanted to like this movie, I really did. I'm a huge science fiction fan, and if Nolan had kept the ""realism"" and tone that the first hour or so promised, I would've been more than happy with this film.Nolan's imagination is impressive, an expansive force that drives many of his movies. However, it is also his downfall in ""Interstellar,"" a film in which he doesn't have the satisfying answers to reconcile the realistic fiction he wants to portray. The plot is littered with points that exist because, well...science. For instance, the characters refer frequently to an equation Michael Cain's character is investigating to solve a ""gravity"" problem. But not much explanation is put for into how this would solve anything about bringing a colony of people into space.Finally, this opinion will probably cause many people to ignore me: I feel Nolan is still a very good filmmaker, but this movie glimpses him falling into the same ""black hole"" (see what I did there?) which ensnared M. Night Shyamalan. Because ""Inception"" and his Dark Knight trilogy were such a massive, profound success, he feels the need to make every ounce of dialogue ooze from the actors' mouths as if it's the most important, mind-altering thing you've ever heard. The movie becomes bogged down with long, dragging sequences of people staring as if in wonder, coming to realizations that are meant to inspire awe in us. However, these do little more than bloat an already over-long running time that felt like 7 years, but amounted to one Earth hour. The end serves up a slew of maddeningly predictable ""twists"" that were pretty obvious an hour before the big reveal.I will say the acting is done incredibly well by the cast, even if their script is not always on par with their talents. As always, Nolan is exceptional with visuals, and most of the tremendously dramatic middle portion was effective, albeit borderline overdone with sap. I could've managed without as many repetitions of Dylan Thomas' ""Do not go gentle into that good night."" A beautiful poem that is awkwardly spouted throughout the film. A couple times was effective, five times was pretentious.This will not deter me from seeing future Nolan feature presentations, however, it in no way deserves the IMDb ""9"" rating that it has simply because it is Nolan. I can see why people would be impressed enough by the visuals to forgo the convoluted, flawed story, but not enough to land the film in any top 250. If this exact film were released under any other filmmaker's name (besides perhaps Spielberg or the like), I can guarantee you it would be far less lauded by audiences.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Visual and scientific experience,"Fascinating story with beautiful scenes and music that really draws me in. I start with why it still does not get 10 points. The early sequence when Cooper hacks into the drone and controls it seems a bit awkward to me if it was meant to characterize him. And although it is a clever idea to watch Cooper observe the past (and not simply time travelling) I was a bit disappointed because the story is not consequent in the aspect of manipulating the past. On the other hand, I was intrigued by the aspect of ageing as a consequence of gravitation and acceleration and how this is incorporated in the script. What I further like about this movie is the visualization of higher dimensions. And the fact that the are no aliens, only human beings. The size and desolation of the universe that we see emphasizes the message that humanity itself is responsible for our planet.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Nolans 'not quite' 2001,"This movie has achieved a very high rating on IMDb and so I had a very high level of expectation before seeing it. My one concern was that I've found Nolan's recent work (particularly Inception) to contain some excellent ideas and cinematography but to be overlong and rambling in places. I found Interstellar to suffer from the same faults. Very interesting ideas, great cinematography, solid cast (although I wish Matthew McConaughey would deliver his dialogue more clearly and not mumble so much. He doesn't seem to have fully recovered from his role in True Detective and I couldn't understand what he was saying much of the time and I was not alone in this. A number of reviewers have used the word 'epic' to describe this movie. I'd be more blunt and say it could have done with some more effective editing. A friend of mind made the comment that it may take several years to get from Earth to Saturn and when you see Interstellar, it feels like you're making the same trip! An exaggeration maybe but the movie is very long and lacks pace at some points. Not all bad news however - some sections are very impressive and visually spectacular, although some ideas have been borrowed from other sources - obviously 2001/ 2010 and Arthur C Clarkes story 'Rendezvous with Rama'. Definitely worth seeing but I don't share the 'masterpiece' line of some reviewers. Good but not great.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Are you kidding me?,"I don't go to the movies anymore because they've become out of my reach financially. So, while trying to decide what to stream one night, I saw that Interstellar had an 8.6 rating. I know that means nothing in and of itself, but a neighbors son told me it was fantastic. I was skeptical going in because anything that stretches the credulity of science too far doesn't interest me. No spoilers here. I'm just going to say what many have already said. This film is based on absurd premises and I had a hard time following the plot at times. I was hoping that something extraordinary would come along to save the film, but, as others have said, it gets worse as it goes on.

Beautifully crafted movie that tries to hard to be smart and looks stupid doing so,"If the underlying logic is missing, the story overly simplistic and weak, then spending 160 million on production isn't going to make it a great movie. The potential is huge but the end result feels lacking. This may well could have been a real masterpiece with a bit more thoughtfulness and work. It has some interesting science wrapped around a meager plot.It may well have sky high ambitions, very good production value, actors and cgi but the underlying script is just very weak. It lacks even the most basic logic. How this can be considered as intelligent and philosophical is beyond me.The science is heavily dumbed-down and simplified, presumably to appeal to a wide audience. The overall script is extremely simplistic. The philosophical aspect shallow and empty. The whole is wrapped into a fantastic presentation but ultimately a hollow experience.Matt Damon gives his worst performance to date (blame the script). Anne Hathaway looks lost the entire time and completely out of place. Matthew Mcconaughey flies the spacecraft like hes doing arcade games, the only thing missing is the occasional 'yeahaaaa!' like a cowboy.I applaud the ambition but overall it's a mess.

This will probably remain as my favorite Matthew McConaughey movie forever.I have to say, it may beat Inception on my scale of favorites if any of the theoretical science comes to fruition.

"Pretentious, self-important and void of fun","'Interstellar' is a three hour movie marathon that contains too few redeeming features to make it worth your time. Going into this movie, everybody would have expected an extremely well made, visually beautiful spectacle, and that's what you get. However, everything else about the film is a disappointment.Sitting staring at a screen for three hours is no fun, unless of course you're watching something entertaining enough to take your mind off it. Throughout 'Interstellar', I found my mind wandering, and I must admit to feeling a sense of relief when the whole thing was over. The film just isn't sufficiently interesting to justify such a long running time.Whilst visually impressive, 'Interstellar' is void of fun.

A 3 hour Science Lecture delivered by a Village Idiot,"Let me start by saying that I have enjoyed Christopher Nolan's work in the past; Memento, Insomnia, (parts of) The Batman Trilogy. I find him a very talented film-maker with strong ideas and visual sense. Therefore it makes me very sad to state that, categorically, this is an absolute turkey. In many places, the plot is so full of holes, that you can do little but laugh-out loud. There will be reviewers on here, talking about DEPTH, Intimations of Mortality etc etc. Forget it. This is just a total misfire. Actors used to say, despairingly, that they were playing Johnny Exposition - you know the guy who explains everything to the audience. Note I said Despairingly. This has almost every character explaining everything from wormholes to the Mystery of Love (oh yeah). After a totally boring, drawn-out beginning which seems to be there to prove that Nolan has watched The Grapes of Wrath many times over, we get the first huge laugh when we meet Sir Michael Caine, with a laughable Posh - Cockney - American accent. He is playing the part that Sam Shephard (in this) or Morgan Freeman (usually) play. He is not up to it; never was never will be. It takes a certain amount of skill to be able to deliver line after line of pseudo-scientific gobbledygook and make it sound real. Caine's performance - like so many of his performances - screams out ""Where's my bleedin' paycheck?"" When Coop (Gary Cooper - westerns - get it) agrees to fly this practically suicidal mission to the outer reaches of space, he blasts off like a Cosmic Cowboy, all bravado and charisma - at which point his fellow crew member shows him - with a pen and paper - what a wormhole is. Yes, when he is leading a flight into outer space, a little late doncha think? It gets worse, when poor Anne Hathaway, playing, as my son said - Science Girl, has to recite a monologue about Love and how it can cross all dimensions of space, time, blah blah blah. I really felt for her. I won't expand on the Plot, I couldn't if I wanted to. And the last 30 minutes have to be seen to be disbelieved. This is NOT one of those films that you see and forget immediately, you will wake up in a few months time, laughing at Michael Caine's last scene or his recital of Dylan Thomas' famous lines - not once but twice...and the End. Oh the end. McConaghey gives it his all, having to cry on more than one occasion - believe me, I know how he felt. Don't believe anyone if they tell you 'you didn't GET it'. That's like saying you didn't GET an episode of Two and a Half Men. Ambitious yes, but a turd is a turd - even if they meant to produce a new hybrid Rose.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Peak sci-fi,"I will start of this by saying the negatives, which their are few of. The story can at times be a bit off-putting, or even confusing if your not giving full attention. Especially the end which I personally liked alot, but It is a bit odd what happened, and I can see it not making alot of sense for people. The acting is mostly solid but there's a couple actors in here which aren't the best, mainly John Lithgow which he does fine but not good, a few of the side characters, and child actors (though ofc it's not their fault). The shots can occasionally be odd, in how some shots feel too far away to how I think it should be, even though mostly the cinematography is solid.Only the positives. The music in this film is not only brilliant on its own, it is so well put into the film to fit however it's supposed to be used; much more elegant ways then most films. The music is probably my favorite movie soundtrack at the moment too. The cinematography is great at almost all times, the shots on the sides of the ship I think are really cool, alot of shots spin with them, there was a shot that was intentionally blurry in here to fit the mood, and the camera shakes when it's appropriate and is usually still when not. As well I feel the more intense shots are done wonderfully, following very well if needed. Acting performance from Matthew McConaughey I think might be his best performance, which says alot, as well the performance from Anne Hathaway is really great here, and some of her best work. And this is definitely Jessica Chastains best work I've seen. Matt Damon as usual does excellent. And Michael Caine also does pretty alright, even though he feels pretty emotionless for alot of the movie, but also kinda mysterious, which can fit that character. John Lithgow does fine, good for him though, and I like how he did, just not too great. And I could name all the actors but really for the most part they are all good.The sets on this film and effects are top notch. I've heard a lot of the space scenes; namely the one coming out of the wormhole took up to 100 hours to render each frame which definitely shows. The space shots are beautifully detailed, and the sets on earth are great because they actually grew a cornfield.The story of this film is also great, and is executed very well. It's told like alot of Nolan movies though (memento, Dunkirk) where mysteries are introduced throughout, and explained later, and the story is kinda told in reverse to traditional stories. But the story makes perfect sense, up until the very end which I think does, but is debatable. And feels really smart, and scientific. Using actual science to explain alot of this stuff, and properly doing so.I love all the little details they added here too, like every tick on millers planet was one day, that kinda stuff is really cool, doesn't make it much better but just interesting. Which this movie has tons of!Over all I feel it's a 9.2Spoiler portion real quick for this endPeople don't like the end but it feels very right to me, it makes sense in the plot, and is explained fine, but definitely seems a bit unlikely. But feels like a good ending, everything is wrapped up nicely with a bow, and not in a all good way, but just a very nice ending. Not all is made up for at the end either. He's still missed atleast 80 years on earth. While it failed. But my only problem with it is how did they colonize so fast? Still a good ending, and I also like where they imply goes with brands story but never shown.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Epic fail,INTERSTELLAR is emotional and well acted but lacking substance: I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS FILM WAS ABOUT! Space travel? Interdimensional travel? It's also bleak. 'Contact' (1997) was a similar but much better. Christopher Nolan's best film was 'Insomnia' (2002); 'Batman Begins' (2005) wasn't bad either. 'Inception' (2010) was another Christopher Nolan film I didn't think much of (turned it off) because like Interstellar I'm not sure what it was about; so much going on on the surface; so complex and sophisticated but also empty and convoluted. 4/10.,,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Hyped to the stars, but never achieves lift-off...","mediocre acting overuse of dialog to explain the back-story and fake/contrived science.It's like whoever wrote the script is some ""enlightened meta-philosopher"" (RE: psychedelic substance user)with an overgeneralized and topical understanding of astrophysics. Most people that have enjoyment studying astrophysics will be horribly annoyed watching a bunch of actors blabbering and playing ""experts""...if you know a little about astrophysics you will find it cringe-worthy.Matthew McConaughey was mis-cast; he doesn't have a believable character in this one...same with Hathaway. They both come across as if they don't even believe the sincerity of their own lines - the dialog is very weird and almost forced at times, especially with bizarre out-of-place technical and/or scientific jargon that would never be brought up among expert colleagues (i.e. Nolan overusing dialog to inform the ""dumb"" audience about the background ""science"")It's less of a story, and more of a writer trying to force-feed their own gnarly philosophies to whom they must deem a dull and uninformed audience. It could have been a lot more, but Nolan chose to sit on the fence as far as what type of sci-fi it would be, whether fantastical or ""realistic"".So where's all the hype from? The liberal media that can't help but interject politics into everything...the idea of an Earth uninhabitable conforms with their world-views about climate change, so they completely overlook the actual film itself.Overall very boring...If you're looking for Star Wars, Star Trek, Serenity, etc...look elsewhere...If you're looking for a recent watchable sci-fi; I'm usually not a fan of Tom Cruise's movies, but his last sci-fi, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" wasn't half bad...at least better than Oblivion.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Interstellar is 10 times beyond Inception but not that perfectly executed,"Interstellar is one of those sci-fi that demands your attention throughout the film.If you are hoping for action like The dark Knight or Inception ,you would surely be disappointed. For me it is more like feeling the movie rather than just watching it.Matthew McCaughey nailed it this time. The only thing disappointing in this movie is the way they ended it.The plot has so many holes that you can't help but notice.Anne Hathaway's one dialogue ruin its ending.'Love is the one thing that transcends time and space'.Seriously? I mean if you want to take liberty in Black hole's quantum data scene you could have shown anything but scientific.Anyway, overall its a fantastic movie ,after all its a Nolan movie.

Not So Stellar,"It's a pretty good movie. You'll be immersed in the visuals, the graphics, some mystery, and a review on quantum physics in space, and you will enjoy the mysteries contained in it. However, the acting and casting are almost embarrassing at times and poor. The narrative and script suffers greatly from a lack of focus and pointless plot tricks. There's a sequence toward the end that while engaging, is some of the most over the top dramatic, just-for-effects senseless filmmaking you will ever see. It worked in Inception, but not in Interstellar. Overall, it is a ""pretty good"" film, but it falls short in so many categories. The visuals are worth the ride, and the best part is the presentation of the new planets. If only they would have spent more time on the water planet (that was the best part of the movie), but then if they did, every hour was worth 7 years on earth, so the story had to go elsewhere. The other graphics were good too. But there are some senseless plot turns that will frustrate you and it will lose points immediately from its' current 8.7 rating. For example, was Matt Damon's space crazy Dr. Mann even necessary? The answer when you think about it is no. It had no point in the overall story except to add more drama and intensity to an audience who already had plenty to begin with. What a waste of top level talent.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"That's not shinola you see thru that black hole, Grasshopper.","A good friend of mine, the writer Mark Shulman, once pointed out that our standards are being gradually eroded, so that sadly, we are left with less and less in lieu of a threshold of acceptability, finding ourselves not unlike frogs in a pan being brought to a slow, imperceptible boil.Christopher Nolan and some of his cast are telling the press that Interstellar is a love story. I will take them at their word and assume that whatever else I picked up on was left there unwittingly, for the rest of us to parse through.Considering how much pain is involved in traveling to and from a crowded movie theater on a Saturday night, I feel like it's my prerogative, when I have paid good money, to take a film apart if I am still hungry for substance at the end of it; and I WILL get my nourishment from something or other, if not from the movie's plot itself.The first thing that strikes me, when I think back to the experience of Interstellar, is that it leaves me with nothing, emotionally - no takeaway. I did not care about any of its characters, or believe they were real, and I did not really worry about the fate of humanity (any more than the film itself actually does, beyond paying it casual lip-service).I wasn't awed like I may have been by other wondrous space movies that Interstellar measures itself against (or steals from), and I am not compelled to go back and see any part of it ever again. (I suspect most viewers won't either, once the collective neophile contact high has passed.)For starters, I do not like the moral core of the story: Interstellar is a film about ""saving humanity"" but it is unclear who will pay for humanity's failures. The film offers a great debate over where to repopulate, but none about what we have learned from having to leave our home in the first place. There is no therapy, no penance, no sacrifice. In a way, this represents a subconscious confession about our culture's moral failures: when we run out of spaces to consume, and out of fertile ground to slash an burn, we will have to look for new worlds to expand out into, since we cannot show self control and learn to care for what we have...But enough psychobabble. A dysfunctional moral compass is not the worst thing about Interstellar.The worst thing about the film is that, to quote my girlfriend, ""It's OK to for characters to talk in pseudo-scientific gobbledygook when the show is Star Trek, because in Star Trek, they all have pointy ears.""Interstellar may be worth a glance, certainly for the photography and exciting visuals, but it is a buffet of messy ideas that fire in all directions. Clearly the script is not written by career screenwriters, but by a director who has freed himself from gravity and has achieved his own artificial self-sufficiency amid the vast nothingness.The result is an often far-fetched and unintelligible, outlandish tale which takes an awfully long time to suspend the viewer's disbelief (and cringing), to finally arrive at a tepid plot after about an hour or so.In hindsight, it makes perfect sense that Nolan's 'tightest' film is Memento, a dis-cognitive story told from the point of view of a man who is unable to string two events together, or to remember where he started.Interstellar is not an intelligent picture, but a pseudo-intelligent one. It seems designed to appeal to the sort of audience who loves to be flattered with cheap shots - a sort of space odyssey version of ""who wants to be a millionaire?"" Its success resting entirely on the fact that every member of the audience gets to feel superior. To whom? No one knows. This technique seems to be trending within the Nolan's filmography.For the rest, the picture is a narrative mess that trivializes space travel on a galactic scale, (black hole, wormhole, same difference,) and is often plagued by ridiculous star-studded cameos that shatter the viewer's concentration by landing in the middle of tense emotional scenes like a cockroach in your soup.The film is oddly timed with elliptical cuts that compress the action into some often confusing edits, and only leave in lieu of dialog some awful scenes of trite, contrived exposition, filled with emetic pseudo physics, sure to give an immature modern audience raised on Batman a sense that they are building their cultural ego by agreeing with this farce. Worst of all, it feels long and never ending.Sadly, good science fiction is hard to come by, harder than a good ordinary film even, and although this picture is somewhat entertaining, it fades away from the heart and mind, like the flickering green of the traffic light we just passed, as we head home from the cinema, once more.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Interminable,"I'm never too fussed with realism or realistic special effects in movies â€“ after all, similar to millions of other people I only watched a two-dimensional series of images under Persistence Of Vision on a flat screen telly in a corner of my front room tonight. I wasn't actually ""there"" or wanted to be either and I have no intention of reading Einstein or praising or dissing him afterwards either. I wouldn't even bother to create a loop by promising not to denigrate with a So What that this apparently was a film produced and finished on film too.It's a 21st century cgi cartoon update on When Worlds Collide which was a much artier and worthier film than 2001, with a nod to Close Encounters and its breathtaking nonsense taken for sage symbolism again. Convoluted plans coalesce to populate foreign countries, sorry, galaxies as the Earth or at least the American Midwest is slowly dying. It involves going through a Saturnian wormhole in much the same style as a Cosmic Pinball Wizard picking from a list of possible habitations given to ""Us"" by ""Them"", whoever that lot were. Oodles of human schmaltz is ladled on the concoction for good measure as a counterpoint to inter-dimensional gobbledygook to ensure some people's eyes don't glaze over. A few points: Playing Love Is All Around instead may save a lot of time for impatient people; director Christopher Nolan used grizzled Michael Caine yet again, he must be a really big pal; Robbie the Robot from Forbidden Planet seemed incredibly dexterous and more anthropomorphic in comparison to the clunky TARS & Co. on display as AI in here; on that bloody icy planet cool customer Matt Damon certainly had his plans well laid for saying he didn't expect to be ever opened up again; I ask again why is it so fashionable to growl and grunt colloquial dialogue in guttural whispers â€“ I don't expect everyone, or anyone for that matter to be up to Laurence Olivier's standard of diction but we're not all Kings Of Leon fans; somewhat flat when it finally came the long expected but still creepy farewell between father and daughter! The money shots for me were the emotional and fraught Lander craft re-docking with the Endurance scenes, however it was taken so slowly I thought for a while Anne Hathaway had fainted. The cartoonery is routinely spectacular, at eye-cutting edge.Basically: as with Inception this involves a huge leap of faith from the er well-grounded but unwary viewer; get over it and it's entertaining hokum to be watched with a tesseract of salt â€“ I switched on, switched off and enjoyed it.

My favorite movie of all time.,"I had a special interest in science since my childhood. I tried to read all the sci-fi related books. During the shutdown, I watched a lot of movies as well as a lot of documentaries on science. When I heard that my favorite director Christopher Nolan directed a movie in astrophysics, I was shocked. I watched it as soon as possible. Honestly, I will not skimp on rating 10/10 in each of Direction-Acting-Score-Cinematography. Moreover, it is only possible for Nolan to get impossible details in the necessary places, accuracy as well as not to drag complex science in unnecessary places or take the help of fiction in the interest of the movie. I missed some key points without seeing the problem of sound mixing and without subtitles for which I see it again in print the next day, seeing it properly, I realized that Nolan has created a masterpiece!It will be more enjoyable to watch the movie as a drama without trying to understand it as sci-fi. Because human emotion has been given priority in many cases here. Even in some cases Nolan has ignored science in the interests of the drummer. So in the end Interstellar is more of a drama than a sci-fi, which conveys a more beautiful message about love than many romantic movies. Of all the powerful dialogues in the whole movie, this one seems to me to be the best.Not to mention the soundtrack of the movie. Some music plays with people's emotions, at the same time can bring different kinds of feelings, can put pressure on the nerves. One such score is Interstellar music by Oscar-winning composer Hans Zimmer, who has previously worked with Nolan on Inception, The Dark Knight, and you must remember what a terribly beautiful creation the music track was.Interstellar's cast made me even more excited about it. While immersed in the true character of True Detective, Matthew appeared in the role of Cooper, along with one of my favorites, Anne Hathaway and Mackenzie Foy, but even if you haven't seen Mackenzie Foy before, you can imagine that this box of cuteness will grow into another Jessica Chastain!It also seems wrong to expect Nolan's movie to be simple linear. Interstellar seems to me parallel non-linear (although I doubt if there is anything with this name). Something happens before, and some happens at the same time. An attempt was made to describe the incident linearly.People reach a stage where they have to be developed from 4 dimensional being to 5 dimensional being. 5D sees time as a dimension so they can navigate at any time. These 5 dimensional human beings are THEY!But time is also a physical dimension for 5D. It's like you can see all the events laid out in front of you, you can see your birth, your school life, your marriage, your death ...As long as humans are 5D, the earth is destroyed, so they are located in another galaxy. But if they come to this other galaxy, it will take a way that was not discovered until the earth was destroyed.Wormholes are a type of quantum anomaly. At the quantum level, it is seen that electrons can move from one place to another without passing any time. This concept is called wormhole. If the wormhole could be created in the form of a mass, it would be possible to pass two light-years apart almost any time apart.It is not possible to create wormholes naturally due to the huge amount of energy and dark energy required to keep them warm and stable. But 5D people have found a way to stabilize wormholes. This time they created a wormhole and placed one end of the wormhole near Saturn in our solar system, the other end in the galaxy where future humans will be.So this time we need to transfer the people of the world to a new place. For this they choose Murph K. Murphy's father, Cooper, is a NASA engineer and pilot, and Murphy is exceptionally intelligent.From Morph's bookshelf comes the Morse code signal 'STAY' which is sent by Murphy's father Cooper, a 5D Tesseract created by Future 5D Human. Because the first time Cooper enters Tesseract, he thinks he's stuck here forever, and nothing would have happened if Past Cooper hadn't been on this mission. Then Cooper realizes the power of Tessaract. Tessaradact is a 5D model, so he can navigate at any time. Grace received the necessary information about the singularity for the Gravity Equation Solve from Tarsus Black Hole, which he was converting to Cooper for Morse and sending to Cooper Murph controlling the second hand of the clock.If space-time is continuous multiverse we can never see another universe but gravitational pull. That's why Cooper uses Gravity for contact.Data from Singularity from Murph Cooper and data from Romley's Black Hole all solve the Gravity Equation, which was started by Professor Brand. It is through the gravity equation that the massive Cooper station and the people of the world begin their journey from the earth to the human new home to use gravity.Meanwhile, as soon as Cooper Murphy finishes sending all the info needed for gravity equation, the purpose of the Tesseract is fulfilled, and the 5D closes the Tesseract and sends Cooper and Tarsus back to Saturn with a wormhole. ('The first handshake as Cooper crosses the wormhole)The Rangers found and rescued Cooper as he passed Saturn at Marfra Cooper Station.Suffice it to say, wormholes are so far only possible at the quantum level. Although the black hole was discovered, no information was found inside its event horizon. The tesseract part of the ending is completely fiction, even if it doesn't say May be 5 dimensions so far only in theory. String theory also speaks of 9 dimensions. But so far nothing has been scientifically proven. Maybe 'they' will answer these questions.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Nice movie,"Watching Interstellar was nothing short of an extraordinary journey that left me in awe long after the credits rolled. Directed by Christopher Nolan, this film transcends the boundaries of conventional cinema, taking us on a profound voyage through space and time that is as visually stunning as it is intellectually stimulating.From the moment Interstellar begins, you are thrust into a future Earth on the brink of ecological collapse. The desperation and urgency are palpable, setting the stage for an epic quest to save humanity. What struck me immediately was the film's ability to blend grandiose science fiction with deeply personal storytelling. The relationship between Cooper, played masterfully by Matthew McConaughey, and his daughter Murph is the emotional heart of the film, grounding the cosmic adventure in a relatable human experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Dare I say it's a space opera? When story and music collide perfectly,"I wanted to see this on the large screen so badly when it was coming to theaters, but nobody in my immediate sphere could see it with me. So on an afternoon in December I say all by myself in the theater to see it in the middle of the day with almost nobody around me. Probably for the best, considering how badly I bawled my eyes out in various parts of it.Firstly, the characters, both principal and ancillary, are all played with great effectivity by all the people involved. You care about these people. Not just because the represent hope for the species but because of how vested they are in mission success and in each other. You even care about TARS as well for goodness sakes, and he's a robot (but I cared about Data and Bishop too, so there's that.) The story was paced as well as it could be, considering how much story there was to tell in only 2 hours 40 minutes.Second, if you watch it the first time it's a science fiction movie about survival, humanity, time, space, family, etc. When you watch it from the vantage point about it being a father-daughter movie, it completely changes the tenor of things and makes it all that more emotional of an experience, in addition to being a visually compelling one. Once I relayed this to my own experience as a father to a daughter of my own, my empathy level for Cooper went off the charts and catapulted this film into one of my favorites of all time.Lastly and I think most importantly - THE SCORE. Oh good great goodness, Hans Zimmer has been a favorite of mine since I bought the Broken Arrow soundtrack in my high school years. But this is probably his masterpiece. The breath of the billowing organ, thrust against the ambient, dissonant and sometimes harmonious synthesizer work brings this sense of our organic essence in relief to the machinery that is thrusting us into space and enabling us to achieve greatness as our earth is failing us. This score is only more captivating with further listening and you will remember everything you felt in those moments without a single image in front of you.A great movie, delivered by an epic score. It's everything I want in the film experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Visually Exceptional But Lacks Depth,"Visually, Interstellar is exceptional and brilliantly rendered. The plot is centered on a attempt of poignant savior of humanity against global warming that has made the earth uninhabitable by the behavior of those in the 20th century. Yet only the United States is reflected and it is well known American's live differently than many other smaller or say 3rd world countries. Shouldn't we at least take a glimpse at what they turned out like before shooting off? Or did we forcibly take over every other country and ruin it all? As you can see it's already not making full sense. The human race is in jeopardy so obviously we must look too Matthew McConaughey and his character Cooper to save the day, uh, world population. Cooper is your run of the mill ex pilot, engineer, and obviously single parent forced by the government no less to run a farm. That's right a farm , where all the most brilliant people of your country should be hiding. He is then pulled off his farm and told to pilot a bunch of non credible i.e also non-believable scientists that include the likes of Anne Hathaway and Wes Bentley to go find a planet suitable for human life. With all the talk of humanity and the first hour going on about the downfall of humanity on earth there is little humanity in the characters. An ongoing weakness of Nolan's work is constantly relying on effects and name actors to flitter around the screen as one dimensional people and little substance to hold on to. It's fairly hokey and riddled with epic nonsense.Now if this was a small indie film, I would be much more lenient and applause the attempt but considering the budget and scale of production with access to anything and everything money can buy and all the time , locations, and experts in the world at their disposal it would be crazy to let it pass. The visuals are top notch but there is really no excuse for such a lazy, one dimensional film, that lacks so much sense when every aspect a filmmaker could possibly desire was at their feet. It seemed like mind numbing visuals just thrown out to the public as if we would be too simple to notice there's nothing really to it. I much rather watch a carefully crafted no budget film where I feel the filmmakers heart and soul and probably a whole lot of tears poured into every possibly imperfect but purposeful scene than see how far our technology has gone but how digressive our minds have. There is one thing for sure other than the spectacular visuals is if this is the intellect we will hold steady to, we likely will ruin our planet.While I like McConaughey and think has really proved himself a top notch actor in recent years this film did him no favors and certainly was not needed to hold such a title.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Rage against the dying of the light.,"I find it hard to articulate how powerful this film is and how it effects me. Chris Nolan has set the bar higher than he did on 'Inception'. The story is based on probable science , with help from Kip Thorne. The cast is perfect. Matthew McConaughy as the former pilot and everyman' who is battling a desire to do what he is destined to do . Fly an outerspace mission or stay on a dying world and looking after his kids. Nolan regular Michael Caine , Jessica Chastain , Timothee Chalamet and Anne Hathaway round out the main cast. The surprise packet is young Mackenzie Foy who's daughter /father relationship drives the emotional side of the film. The robot TARS was my favourite character in the film. He was the humour and he shows human quality when all seems lost.
Hans Zimmer's score maybe the best he's EVER done! Pulsating and driving and plays on the heart strings like no other score I can remember.

Basically a cheap tearjerker for USA audience, cashing in on dwindling patriotism.Protip: if you want good Sci-Fi films try either Sunshine or Pandorum. They are infinitely more entertaining and closer to reality without making paradoxes left and right.

As a sci-fi fan i'm not impressed!,"Unfortunately the film didn't reach the high expectations I had for it! I love sci-fi movies but Interstellar left me flat and disappointed.First the opening hour of the film was boring and ordinary and the 'Earth's problem' with the sand storms was somehow underplayed and unmoving. I thought that maybe when they go in space things could get better... well, they did for a while but then the crew landed on the Ice covered planet and things got pretty sour.The idea of Cooper getting into the dimensional space and wrapping the story with the beginning was good but then again the end was OK and obviously left for a 2nd film.The sound was not good at all - I could barely hear and understand what they were saying, so maybe 50% of the films sound was a high pitched music overpowering the scenes.At the end I thought - this is a film for people who doesn't like sci- fi movies, don't believe in life in other planets and are narrow minded and believe only in conventional science.

The last 20' (out of 170') where the resolution of any ""mystery"" is residing are somehow rewarding but the movie tires its audience long before that.I would like to compare it with Carl Sagan's (check my avatar) Contact (1997) which more than 15 years earlier managed to make a movie faaaar more interesting, and with deeper meanings.The Nolan brothers only went for cheap father(s)/daughter(s) dramas, just to embellish some scientific theories that may or may not be true after all.You see... Despite the facts that this movie advertised as ""more truthful to the current scientific theories, it is pure fiction whatsoever.Overall: If you are a fan of the genre you most definitely will check it out no matter what, so....",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Ambitions make the filming amazing and the plot illogical to sentimental absurdity,"Interstallar (2014)This is a Christopher Nolan movie. So when it does what he does bestâ€”shake you out of your seat with cinematic brillianceâ€”it's terrific. I mean terrific. There are effects, like the black hole, or the various spacecraft maneuvers, and even a few wild dashes through cornfields, that work so well you don't need to think about why they are happening. You are immersed, and impressed, and wowed.But Nolan is more clever than deep it seems. A movie like ""Memento"" takes the slimmest of terrific ideas (a reordering of time in the brain) and make it amazing to watch. Movies like his Batman trilogy avoid even cleverness and work with pure energy and mythology. But in all of these there is no sense of what you would call ""meaning."" They are entertainments.""Interstellar"" is purely horrible scienceâ€”it's the butt of endless jokes on the web. But behind all the liberties and mistakes there, the movie is trying to say something ""deep"" about being human in an inhuman universe. About the special qualities humans have to be innovative, to procreate, and most of all to love. This is a bowing down to the power of love. Love conquers all, that kind of thing.Maybe it's the brother, Jonathan Nolan, who is responsible here as the co-writer. The grandiose ideas the two of them present in ""Batman Rises"" are wonderfully impossible and almost laughable if you take them out of context. (In context they're part of the whole great success of the movie.) But ""Interstallar"" takes itself seriously. Way too seriously for this kind of material and with no grip on the science, not even a hint of it. As a fantasy, it could have gone so much farther, as a piece of art based on reality, well, go see ""Gravity"" for an alternative that makes a better (imperfect) attempt to follow the rules of nature.There is of course the plot here, saving the world, saving the species, saving your family. You have to just go with the flow here, as well, since it's all a bit romanticized in a Spielberg/Cameron kind of plasticky gloss. It frankly made me sickâ€”and yet it was so well filmed I liked it. That's the kickerâ€”Nolan is terrific with the camera, and with the vision of making things vivid and big.See this movie for all of those best things. I saw it on a celluloid (non-digital) IMAX screen and in those portions of the movie shot in full 70mm large format, the effects were memorable. (The movie alternates between standard widescreen 35mm film and full, academy ratio 70mm, which is taller and has far more detail. The normal theater presentations approximate the effects, but in a more normal scale and resolution.)Obviously this movie has won a lot of people over. I'm not sure who they are, but it's reasonable to be blown away. Nolan has openly defended himself against all the complaintsâ€”as if everyone is wrong and we just don't get it. Fine. If you want a hilarious rundown of some of the many logical problems of the movie, see http://popwatch.ew.com/2014/11/08/interstellar-plot-holes/ or type interstallar plot holes entertainment weekly in google.But what until you see it first and just enjoy it on its own terms.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

How can this be rated so high by IMDb?,"This film is 2 hours and 49 minutes of slowly bleeding to death. The magnitude of actors is the only one thing that keeps my attention (e.g. when is Matt Damon inserted into this?). Such a disappointment. I'm very pleased that I waited until this was available on streaming services.The beginning, while slow and lacking character development (and somewhat unbelievable), is interesting. The end is completely ridiculous. I had a flashback to ""The Fifth Element"" where it was declared that love was the 5th element. Too much time spent on irrelevant side stories that added nothing. The ending is difficult to find realistic or plausible. I found myself wondering how this movie could have such high ratings on IMDb after being released over 1 year ago!As a scientist/engineer, I wanted to enjoy this film. I was woefully disappointed.For anyone interested, I'd watch The Martian long before watching this drivel.

A Surprising Rewatch,"I haven't seen the film since it came out in 2014. My teenage self found it slow, confusing, and tiresome. But, now I'm 2023, I decided to give it a rewatch solely because I constantly listen to the score. So, what did I think?I am pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed the film. The film has so much heart for a SCFI movie that it took me off guard. At its core, it's about a Father wanting to reunite/protect his Child. The story was interesting, the ending might've been a bit too optimistic and rushed but it felt satisfying to me as a viewer.The cinematography, music, acting, sound design, set dressing, everything was amazing. Yes, there were points where I was thankful I had subtitles on. Seeing Topher Grace was also a bit odd since only associating him with That 70's Show and Venom. The visuals for the space scenes were astonishing. Truly a feat of CGI and Technological advances.Overall, there are more positives than negatives for the film. It was a great watch, the emotional beats landed for me, the betrayals were impactful, and it left me thinking more about this potential scenario.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
a bit boring,"The word I'd use to define this story is contorted..Nolan's intelligence is out of discussion but the problem here is the difficulty of finding a key. All of this effort, all these questions, all of this movie and for what? There is no answer there. Nolan's mind has conceived Memento, The Prestige, Inception, and now Interstellar, always exploring relevant existential questions but there's always the sense that the person making these movies has no sense of proportions. The movies are about love, they're spiritually generic and require a lot of production.. But the overall idea is that the viewer doesn't know where the story is going..

Well, not really much. But it's a fun trip getting there.I liked many of the characters. And I was invested in their problems and tragedies. But the final ""explanation"" of the film's phenomena has a ""Sixth Sense"" feeling to it.I say see this film for its good points, but don't expect the groundbreaking impact of Kubrick's ""2001"" or the atmospherics of ""Blade Runner"" or the thrilling ride of ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Inter-not quite-stellar,"Unlike, say, Michael Bay, Christopher Nolan always reaches for the highest rung on the ladder. It's an admirable trait, and the results certainly speak for themselves. Unfortunately with 'Interstellar' his grasp on that rung is often tenuous, and the result is a film where awesome and awful play tug of war.Technically the film is brilliant. The F/X and the cinematography are absolutely first-rate. It's too bad they're in service to a convoluted and emotionally stunted story.

A wasted opportunity,"Honestly, I was expecting more from Christopher Nolan. The man is capable of unique vision, of scope that comes across only every once in a while. Such as seen in Inception and The Dark Knight. But this? This is still a good movie, but that's all. It's not great, mainly because of limitations in storytelling, dialogue and style.The biggest problem is that Nolan's faults shine through more than usual. His over-reliance on exposition dialogue, his longwindedness and tendency to linger too long in certain scenes. In most of his movies you get the sense that he had one idea too many. Well, in this he had easily two or three ideas too many. This could have been a two hour movie, without a doubt, and it would have been better for it.It also seems to have problems deciding what it's trying to be. Is it a hard scifi epic along the lines of 2001: A Space Odyssey, or something more leaning towards drama and so called space opera. Certain scenes lean more towards the former, some towards latter, and they don't mesh at all.That being said, it's a fine movie. First of all, it's absolutely gorgeous. I have slight problems with the designs of the actual planets, but every single shot of space is jaw-dropping. I also like that they went and paid actual scientists to figure out what a black hole might look like, among other things. That shows dedication and certainly makes for a very memorable visual.The cast is also superb. The problems with the characters stem from the script, not the actors, and all of them have great chemistry together. One of the underlying themes in this movie is the relationship between father and daughter. Both Matthew McConaughey and Mackenzie Foy, as well as Michael Caine and Anne Hathaway make for a great pair and I have no complaints about their performances.Alas, I just cannot call Interstellar a great film. The ending alone would ruin it for me, but the whole journey is so needlessly long and slow that I never got into it. The movie has a lot of good ideas - the dying Earth, the robots, the black hole's affect on space-time - but those ideas are poorly realized and the whole just isn't as good as Nolan's previous work. It's worth watching, certainly, and it's not a bad film, not at all. Just a deeply flawed one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Glad i didn't watch the trailer,"I was extremely lucky to get the chance to see this film upon its first day release, before entering the cinema, my expectations were already high, after all, this was a film from the cinematic genius who brought us the likes of 'Inception' and 'The Dark Knight', to summarise the following review in a single sentence: I left the cinema in extreme awe from the visual masterpiece I had just viewed. A film that explores the psychological and emotional state of a man whose life revolves around his family, 'Interstellar' is a thrilling and thought-provoking film that boasts an intellectual story masterfully written by the Nolan brothers. Whilst there seems to have been influence from films like '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Apollo 13', 'Interstellar' is unique in its own way. Whilst the subject may be hard to comprehend at times, it can't be denied how visually monumental and thoughtful Christopher Nolan's epic science fiction masterpiece is, and can easily be named the best film of this year and possibly one of the greatest science fiction films to have ever graced the screen.

My friend was really angry, He was joking, that we should ask our money back. I don't felt so wrong, but: The movie was way too long, very, very loud (maybe it was only a local issue, but sometimes music was so loud, that I couldn't understand what actors told).

Wants too much. Achieves almost nothing.,"It's not a bad movie, but it's ordinary at best. Dialogue is very clumsy at times. It's too long, and way too much time is spent on explaining phenomenons that don't need to be explained. It could have been such an elegant and thought provoking movie, but instead it's dead set on explaining absolutely everything. It ruins the mystery, and the opportunity for me to use my own imagination. Unfortunately the time spent making sure that everyone in the audience understands the movie EXACTLY the way the director wants you to, is spent, at the expense of a good storyline and the development of believable characters and meaningful relationships.

Three hours of beautiful looking boredom,"I initially saw the trailer for Interstellar a few months ago and immediately decided that, as the trailer painted it as a dull, rather uninspiring sci-fi epic that I was not going to part with my cash or time by going to see it.Over the last few weeks, as the promotional machine has turned it's wheels and, following many positive reviews both in the media and by trusted friends of mine, I took the day off work purely to go and see Interstellar. I have to say, partly because so many reviews and friends had said ""you've really go to see it in the cinema"". So I didn't want to miss out.I started the film, full of anticipation, that I was truly going to see a masterpiece of cinema with a great cast, engaging dialogue, a thought provoking plot and stunning visuals and, well, it had stunning visuals (apart from the external spacecraft shots looking like something from ""Star Fleet"") and, not much else. To be fair there was a LOT of dialogue. And several of the lines delivered by the robots approached humour.Had it have been around an hour shorter I could possibly have brought myself towards saying it was enjoyable but, in the main I REALLY had to try hard to enjoy this film. It's a strange one as it wasn't bad enough to be terrible but was nowhere near good enough to be enjoyable.At one point I was truly fighting the urge to get up and walk out but didn't as I assumed we were near the end (we weren't, there was still an hour and a half to go)I love Christopher Nolan's films but this smacks of a director being given far too much praise and far too large a budget to play with.Maybe I should have taken more notice of the trailer.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

If I want to watch a movie with space, I prefer and suggest to watch Cosmos: A Space TimeOdyssey (2014), it have more awesome visual stunning effects than this movie and also more clever approach for your brain because it teaches you REAL science.Maybe Nolan is not ready to make a Space Movie. If you think this is the best space movie of all time, I suggest you watch the Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986), Star Wars and Star Trek franchises, and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968).

"Underwhelming and way, way too long","I am baffled by the near universal praise this movie is receiving here on IMDb.Out of 2 hours and 49 minutes:about a half hour was spent watching people crying - every star got their turn;about a half hour was spent watching people docking spacecraft with their joysticks under great duress. Really? With that AI robot thingie we can't automate the docking? And what oh what does docking add to the story?about another half hour was spent watching Matt Damon in a dead-end downer subplot;and then another half hour was spent watching cornfields burning in the distance - why? Just, why?So right there we could cut the movie down to about an hour, and we will only have about 40 minutes left to go. Leaving maybe 10 minutes or so that were visually interesting... moderately. There were no visual breakthroughs of any kind in this movie - zip.And listen, I am a lifetime sci-fi fan. So the movie had a wormhole, and some time distortion. Please, is that in itself enough to satisfy anybody who cares about this stuff or do you maybe have to elaborate and get creative?There was simply nothing of unusual intelligence or quality in this movie. Not the writing, not the acting, not the directing, not the visuals.In the large theatre where I saw this with hundreds of people, one person starting clapping at the end.

Christopher Nolan's Magnum Opus,"Interstellar is the most powerful movie I have ever watched before. This experience is what should define the blockbuster entirely. A brand new idea that challenges the viewer to think, performances that can drive you to tears, editing that feels out of this world, and above all else, a music score that is endlessly watchable that perfectly captures every moment. The drama of this film does not come from a central antagonist, per se (although Matt Damon makes a brilliant villain while he is on screen), but instead, from the simple concept of time.The writing of this whole film pairs with the beautiful graphics to seem extremely scientific, and I would not be surprised if these events could actually happen. So many of the scenes are masterfully laid out, and can be so dramatic. One of the best scenes is when Cooper is leaving, and Murph runs to her father, crying, only to find that he's not staying for her, even after she told him to go. This film is even more powerful later on, when we find out that the person knocking the books off of the shelf, telling him to ""stay"", was actually Cooper, in the future. As the music builds, Cooper is shouting and crying because he knows that this moment could have been prevented, and he would have seen his daughter grow up, but now he will never be able to do that.This is a story about a man who sacrifices everything in his life, for everybody else's life. Learning that the mission was never supposed to succeed is a genuinely fascinating twist, and watching the betrayal on Murph's face as she finds this out is yet another brilliant scene. Matthew McConaughey is so unbelievably perfect in this film, and he seems so genuine of a person that it's hard not to feel bad for him. Every other performance in this music is so unbelievably good, even down to the minor characters. The twists in this movie are beautifully done, and make the movie shine as bright as it possibly could.What absolutely sells the experience is the beautiful sound track by Hans Zimmer. Every piece of music is intense, tear-jerking, and unequivocally beautiful. This movie is an absolute gem and deserves many rewatches. How on earth this film was not even nominated at the academy awards is absolutely beyond me.

The acting is OK but not Oscar winning - in fact some of Matthew McConaughey and his Texan drawl does get a bit tiresome by the end. The story itself inspires much thought, but not in the same way as Inception - that is quite a good thing really as your brain doesn't have to work quite as hard to keep up. Seriously it is an OK film and a good watch, albeit a tad too long - but the last 20 minutes is weird, a little rushed, and could easily be dropped.

Interstellar,"Watching Interstellar was nothing short of an extraordinary journey that left me in awe long after the credits rolled. Directed by Christopher Nolan, this film transcends the boundaries of conventional cinema, taking us on a profound voyage through space and time that is as visually stunning asPersonally, I think Interstellar truly delivers as Christopher Nolan's best masterpiece. Maybe the general population would put this blockbuster seventh place in the category of the 10 best space movies. I for one would rank it third behind First Man starring Ryan Gosling and Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity respectively.I like Interstellar, because it focuses mainly on personal loss and the love one feels for their family. The beginning is spectacular! I love how it opens with a farm surrounded by crops of corn, a humble beginning. Its much better than starting the movie with all that intense, apocalyptic action we see at the beginning and end of superhero movies.The story plot structure is great as well. Cooper is going into space with a crew to a mission to find a new habitat for the next generation of mankind after the food resource begins to die. But even more so bittersweet, he must say goodbye to his beloved daughter Murph and the rest of his family. As he descends further off into space, time becomes either slower or quicker, and his family starts to age, even though, he's been in space for a brief period of time.Along the way, Cooper makes a lot of good, trusted devoted friends on his mission, including those two hilarious cubicle robots, CASE and TARS (I often confuse one for the other). Its neat when they descend into the black hole and kiss goodbye to their galaxy, because it reminds me of the star gate tunnel in Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and the robots make me think of the monoliths because of their shape. I love the suspense that builds as they land on different planetary terrains.Above all, I like it when Cooper descends into Gargantua's abyss toward the end and finds himself all alone in that 5th dimension, which appears at first as a library of flashbacks. Don't wish to spoil for you guys out there, so best not to read my review. For those of you that have watched Interstellar, I'd like to say how Cooper at first feels depressed and personal emptiness for saying goodbye to his daughter, and the loss is greatly heavy I agree, but soon realizes that the theories she had of a ghost in her bedroom was his presence all along it.So in conclusion, Interstellar delivers generally because its a story about the way we feel for others we love that wouldn't give them up for anything, not even a silly mission that is considered a mandatory task like saving the world from famine or finding a new place for humanity to thrive. Family comes first. And that's what I love of this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

I'm writing it after seeing this movie for the third time and I feel that I'm ready to say that this it the best sci-fi movie of all time.If cinema is to be included among the arts, then this is a timeless masterpiece to cherish and Nolan is the Michelangelo of this industry.

Just perfect!,"Everything just merges into a higher unity when watching this film.The plot, the unanswered questions and the graphics. Every thing adds up combined with the best soundtrack from the incredible, Hans Zimmer.I keep comming back to this masterpiece of a movie and might have watched it atleast six times. Personally, I think this is Nolans best film due to his ability to keep the audience entertainerd and drawn from the very first minute.For me, Interstellar is about time and what we have now. Nothing is more valuable than your family, friends and loved ones.This is an absolute must-watch film for every human, eventhough I understand some would find it boring due to the complexity of the narrative. You need to feel it.10/10 without any doubt.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"Okay, but not great","I found this movie slow and tedious in the first 20 minutes or so and at times during the rest of the movie. I also thought the last quarter or so of the film was bizarre. As for the soundtrack, nothing special. I did appreciate that a lot of philosophical questions arise as one watches this movie regarding humans place in the universe and the physical size of the universe and time. On the other hand, I also had the feeling that I was watching an updated version of ""2001, A Space Odyssey"" particularly with the sequence through the wormhole in this movie versus the Stargate in 2001. Also the similarity of the rectangular shapes of the robots to the obelisk, and a few other minor similarities.All in all, I felt this movie was okay, but far from great, and probably will not watch it again unlike some other sci-fi movies including the aforementioned ""2001, A Space Odyssey"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

An Absolute Milestone In The History Of Film,"""Interstellar"" serves as an immense milestone, not only in sci-fi filmmaking, but in filmmaking in general. This movie really reflects the absolute genius of co-writer and director 'Christopher Nolan'. Though, the science fiction depicted in this film may seem implausibly far-fetched, it is quite fascinating to learn that the science of Interstellar is actually based off of cogent theories and hypothesis introduced almost a century ago to the film. Interstellar is a beautiful piece of modern art which deserves all the recognition and praise. This movie discovers the joy of hope and the disappointment when that hope is left unfulfilled, in an interesting way. ""Interstellar"" redefines filmmaking as a whole and has set the bar too high for sci-fi films; it should aid as a form of inspiration for all the future projects set in a similar or the same premises.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Intelligent Science Fiction,"Interstellar is an interesting, thoughtful science fiction film with a good cast. It depicts a near future where an environmental disaster has sent Earth into an irreversible decline, forcing humanity to seek a new home in another galaxy. Although it is not as good as Christopher Nolan's other work, it still rises above most other blockbuster, high budget sci-fi.A number of factors make Interstellar better than average. First of all, it avoids the clichÃ©d film apocalypse with lots of CGI explosions and a central villain. In this movie, the world dies not with a bang, but a whimper as our food crops gradually die out. It also gives interesting consideration to the social effects of such a catastrophe. More importantly, it treats the audience as at least somewhat intelligent. Although I'm certain Neil DeGrasse Tyson could pick it apart on Twitter if he so desired, the film attempts to be somewhat scientifically plausible, incorporating relativity theory and even a mathematical equation as major plot points. It's disturbingly rare for movies in recent years to aim at an intelligence level above that of a thirteen year old.The film also benefits from good designs of its space ships and robots. The robots deserve particular mention. Rather than the typical humanoid looking designs, the filmmakers created a genuinely original, even plausible robot.The main weak point in the film is that it tries to insert too optimistic an ending, when the story really wasn't building to one. Nevertheless, it is well worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Christopher Nolan's Interstellar Uniquely Blends Science, Science Fiction, and a Heartwarming Emotional Narrative","Interstellar is and always was one of my personal favorite films of all time. I first experienced the film in IMAX when it was released in 2014, and I've been a devoted admirer ever since. But this week, I was fortunate enough to be in New York precisely when the film was being re-screened in IMAX - and not just any IMAX, but in the grandeur of IMAX 70mm - as part of the 10th-anniversary celebrations of its release. Despite having seen the film several times before, rewatching it multiple times to mark its decade-long impact, in the magnificent IMAX theaters of the U. S., stands as one of the most extraordinary cinematic experiences we've had in our lives.No matter how many times I watch the film, it always excites me, intrigues me, and also brings me to tears. A unique cinematic experience like no other, that pushes the boundaries of cinema and how science can be depicted in film.The collaborative process between Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan (known for Memento, The Prestige, The Dark Knight, and Westworld, among other works) in crafting the screenplay united two brilliant but slightly different minds. This dynamic provided the creative friction that birthed such an extraordinary story. In the early stages, Jonathan was the principal screenwriter, entrusted with the task of shaping the script. He worked on the project for several years alongside producer Lynda Obst and theoretical physicist Kip Thorne. The original draft was heavily centered on the intricate scientific principles underpinning the plot, such as Einstein's theory of relativity and, in particular, the concept of time dilation.When Christopher came on board as director, he reworked the script to emphasize the emotional and philosophical dimensions of the story. This shift - from a strict focus on science to one that balanced scientific rigor with emotional storytelling - became one of the defining aspects that granted the film its unparalleled strength. It is, ultimately, this synthesis of emotional depth with scientific exploration that elevates Interstellar to a truly extraordinary work within the sci-fi genre.The scriptwriting process between the brothers included a continuous exchange of ideas at every stage of its development. Christopher's inclination toward emotional storytelling intertwined with Jonathan's passion for scientific precision and narrative complexity. As the film's director, Christopher also had the responsibility of translating Jonathan's abstract scientific concepts into compelling, visually stunning cinematic moments and images. This process enabled audiences to grasp abstract and extremely complicated scientific ideas through groundbreaking visual storytelling.It's incredible to witness how, with the passage of time, Interstellar is increasingly recognized not only as a monumental chapter in Nolan's legendary filmography but also as a bona fide classic in the sci-fi genre. With the Nolans now receiving the broader recognition they deserve from the global film and television community (not just their core fanbase), more and more people now grasp the thematic essence the Nolans were striving for with the unique storytelling elements they insisted on including in Interstellar.One of the most unique characteristics of Nolan as a filmmaker is his profound love and respect for science, as well as his understanding of its importance in both storytelling and real-world impact. This is reflected in the themes he chooses to explore, the logical framework behind his scripts, and the technical aspects of his filmmaking process. From project to project, he constantly experiments with new techniques that push the boundaries of film industry technology. He strives to maintain scientific accuracy in his narratives as much as possible while telling captivating stories that highlight the vital role of scientists and the value of intellect in the modern era.Contrary to the common criticism that Nolan's films often sideline female characters, Interstellar features a significant and very welcome representation of strong, influential women in the field of science. Jessica Chastain and Anne Hathaway deliver compelling and charismatic performances, taking center stage in the film's unfolding events and playing a crucial role in the story's progression. Mackenzie Foy also impresses in a once-in-a-lifetime performance of a curious, intelligent, and ambitious child that doesn't shy from the performances of other veteran actors and actresses in the film, with a role that will surely inspire future generations of young viewers.If we delve further into the unique collaborations behind the making of Interstellar, and to the film's unique property of depicting science in the most accurate way possible, the extraordinary partnership between Christopher Nolan and theoretical physicist Kip Thorne stands out as one of the film's most intriguing aspects. This collaboration was paradigm-shifting in its own right, as it sought to depict Einstein's theory of relativity as accurately as possible on screen. Instead of resorting to clichÃ©s or convenient narrative shortcuts, Thorne, a Nobel Prize-winning theoretical physicist, acted as both scientific consultant and producer of the film. His primary role was to ensure that depictions of black holes, wormholes, and the effects of relativity on time dilation were as scientifically accurate as possible.Maintaining scientific precision required a delicate balance between creative cinematic storytelling and the constraints of established physics. While Nolan, known for his narrative complexity and visual ambition, occasionally sought to introduce elements that bent the rules of physics, Thorne firmly insisted on absolute scientific accuracy. This principle of realism shaped not only the depiction of time dilation but also the emotional and philosophical core of the film, where time itself becomes a central, emotionally charged narrative device. Their collaboration continues to set a gold standard for how science can be faithfully integrated into cinematic storytelling.After watching the film in an IMAX theater in the U. S. this week, I noticed a group of young students from a school or some sort of academic club attending the screening. They even took a group photo afterward to commemorate the experience. If that doesn't highlight Nolan's influence in inspiring future generations of innovators and scientists, we don't know what does.Of course, no discussion of Interstellar would be complete without mentioning Hans Zimmer's phenomenal score, which the legendary composer himself has referred to as his most cherished soundtrack in his extensive career.The process of collaboration between Zimmer and Nolan was unconventional and experimental compared to their previous collaborations. Instead of supplying Zimmer with a script or a detailed plot outline, Nolan wrote him a one-page letter describing the film's central emotional core - the relationship between a father and his daughter - and asked him to compose from that emotional premise alone. Without knowing that it was a sci-fi epic, Zimmer crafted an intimate and deeply moving score built around a church organ, capturing the emotional anchor of the story. This approach yielded a score that felt personal and evocative, rather than tethered to the spectacle typically associated with the sci-fi genre. The two also chose to emphasized the use of a church organ to evoke a sense of cosmic awe and spiritual transcendence. Ultimately, the focus on emotional authenticity, rather than bombastic spectacle, produced a soundtrack that has become one of Zimmer's most celebrated works, earning critical acclaim and nominations for the Academy Award and the Grammy.In a typical fashion to Zimmer's groundbreaking works, Interstellar did not initially receive the recognition it deserved from major award bodies like the Oscars or the Golden Globes. But history tends to favor the enduring, and today the Interstellar soundtrack is regarded as one of the most powerful and timeless film scores ever created. The raw emotional resonance it evokes during the film, and even while listening to it completely outside of watching the film, is nothing short of extraordinary.Even generally speaking, looking back at the awards season following the film's release, the Academy's reluctance to recognize Interstellar and Nolan's achievements while creating the film remains truly baffling. Nolan did not receive nominations for Best Director or Best Original Screenplay, decisions that now seem glaringly questionable in hindsight. Particularly when compared to certain contemporaneous winners, like Alfonso CuarÃ³n's Gravity, which Interstellar, in comparison, stands head and shoulders above in ambition, visual storytelling, and philosophical depth in our opinion. With Nolan's triumphant sweep during awards season for Oppenheimer, one can only hope that the Academy will, in the future, be more open to recognizing his contributions to the Sci-Fi genre, which has long been overlooked at such ceremonies.What might have been an open question 10 years ago is now clear: Interstellar has cemented its place in the annals of cinematic history as one of the greatest and most important Science Fiction films of all time. Its scientific precision, gripping narrative, breathtaking visuals, extraordinary performances, masterful soundtrack, and impeccable execution on all fronts have earned it a rightful place as one of the most iconic films to ever grace the silver screen.And above all, it's a whole lot of fun.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Good film,"Good film. Don't get me wrong, I'm a sucker for most of Nolan's (and his brothers') works, but this one just doesn't rise up to the standard of filmmaking that we're used to from these guys.Where to start? The overtly obvious and clichÃ© ending? If you've seen any movie involving space-time puzzles and paradoxes, you see it coming from miles away. One might say that's not the point of the movie, that we should rather see it as a story of love and affection and whatever. Well, sorry folks, the Nolans seem to talk the talk but they can't walk the walk. The ""dramatic"" content of this film is barely above that of a romantic comedy. It relies too heavily on time paradoxes but doesn't really give us the psychological background of the characters, as to why they do what they do.Some clichÃ© shots: explanation of the worm hole is exactly the same as in Event horizon. The girl running after the car of the departing father, only to be held by another loved one, queue dramatic music- wow, I haven't seen that before. The ""beings"" (or us in the future) simplifying their reality so it suits our cognitive capacities-come on Matthew, you've done that movie already! The robots look like Monoliths from 2001. Well, if you're gonna be inspired by Kubrick, be inspired by the sheer emotional and psychological subtlety and precision that makes 2001 a masterpiece.""Human nature"" is a very easy answer to explain both all the evil and all the goodness that is going on. Yeah we have survival instinct, also compassion for our loved ones, which may come into conflict with the overall goal of our survival as species. So where are all these forced-tear-jerker scenes coming from? What else is new since 2001 or Solaris? Is that all there is to it? A movie with this much ambition and hype was supposed to be a milestone in the genre, but instead it is a faint copy, easily forgettable. What we've seen previously from these guys in films like The Following, Memento and also in Dark Knight, hell, even Inception, is that they really know how to create memorable characters with unique insight into their psychological background. None of that complexity is to be found in this movie. The characters are made from cardboard and they feel like repetitions of other sci- fi movie stereotypes. The dramatic substance of the movie, which is literally thrown to our faces every moment, does not live up to the quality of its' technical execution. Sure the visuals are great, but that's to be expected from a $169 million movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Cool,"Christopher Nolan's Interstellar (2014) isn't just a science fiction film; it's a sweeping epic exploring themes of love, sacrifice, and humanity's enduring quest for survival. Set in a near-future Earth ravaged by blight and dust storms, the film follows a group of astronauts undertaking a perilous journey through a wormhole in search of a new home for humanity. While the complex scientific concepts might initially seem daunting, Nolan masterfully weaves them into a narrative that is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally resonant.The film's narrative strength lies in its compelling characters. Matthew McConaughey delivers a powerful performance as Cooper, a former NASA pilot turned farmer, grappling with the responsibility of leaving his children behind to embark on a mission that may never return him. His unwavering love for his daughter Murph, played with remarkable depth by Mackenzie Foy (young Murph) and Jessica Chastain (adult Murph), forms the emotional core of the film. The bond between father and daughter transcends time and space, serving as a powerful reminder of the enduring strength of familial connections. Anne Hathaway's portrayal of Amelia Brand, a brilliant astrophysicist, adds another layer of complexity to the narrative, showcasing both scientific prowess and emotional vulnerability.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Very nearly out-of-this-world,"With Earth running out of resources, astronauts make a last-ditch attempt at locating other habitable planets within reach. This is possible via a wormhole, of unknown origin. And it *has* to work.At its core, this is about the love between a father, Coop(McConaughey, an everyday man with vital experience and a good team leader), and his daughter, Murph(Chastain, independent and as stubborn as he is). This is simultaneously its greatest strength and weakness. Everything we are excited about rides, to some extent, on us, and them, caring about both of them, and what they share. Thus, we never stop caring, and it enhances all the thrilling space adventures(almost exclusively grounded in reality, and the best theories), where the mastery of movement(or relative stillness) of the camera and the volume of the soundtrack(and sometimes deafening silence) builds tension to its breaking point, and, crucially, never beyond it. And unfortunately, this emotional grounding does eventually lead to some sappy sentimentalism.The ending will divide audiences. This owes a great, and openly acknowledged, debt to Kubrick's 2001, but it isn't a mere tribute to that, and to exploration of the stars and what that can bring, the latter of which it seeks to encourage a return to. It goes different places, and the third act will be long debated, as it deserves. The humor is well-integrated, not distracting and it eases us out of what would otherwise be relentless and unbearable heaviness. All of the effects are amazing, and the technology compelling. Watch this in the theater, it is made very much for that, as far as the visual and audible experience. The 2 hour and 45 minute running time, and that's not counting the closing credits, will scare some off, and it is perhaps too long.There is some disturbing content and a little moderate language in this. I recommend it to everyone who doesn't outright hate NolanÂ… it is very much one of his films, for better as well as worse, however, even with the hokey aspects, this is one you shouldn't miss. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

I had high hopes for this movie, and usually when you go in there with high expectations you almost always come out disappointed. That's not the case with this movie! It was actually far better than I had dared to dreamed about! I couldn't stop thinking about it for days afterwards.This movie addresses some important questions.

An epic from a movie genius.,"Interstellar- An inter galactic space travel to other galaxies through worm holes by other dimension of time using gravitational physics mixed up with time warping and relativity concepts. yeah yeah.... by now you can understand the depth of the movie which Nolan wanted to show the world in his latest offering. I went to the film with maximum expectations and it exceeded in every aspect. The plot is quite simple. but the way of execution is complex. The film starts off on a smooth note and the excitement increases as the movie goes. I liked every bit of the movie. Matthew McConaughey is awesome throughout the film as his expression in some particular scenes leave u in an awe. Marvellous job by him to carry the film. All the lead cast played exceptionally well.People are asking me whether it is of Gravity range??? I simply asked them back why do u want to compare this with that?? I seriously don't like to compare two movies even if they are of the same genre. I don't want to play a spoilsport here so I'm not revealing or jotting any plot lines here. The screenplay, as usually by JONATHAN NOLAN, is very gripping and he surely does a remarkable job with the script too. Another big gem for the film is its BGM. What can i say about Hans Zimmer which u already don't know? The BGM gelled so well with the movie that u almost think the BGM is a representation of on screen presentation. Some scenes got much elevated by the impeccable work of Hans. His use of instruments and strings require a special mention. Especially during the final 5-10 minutes of the movie, the BGM is so good that it almost left me speechless and haunted me the rest of the day. A huge respect to Zimmer.Coming to my movie God CHRISTOPHER NOLAN....... There was a time when i thought what if a directer directs only Gentlemen Class movies and not the silly stuff to hang around the industry. Then i came to know about Nolan and his works. At first i was thrilled by his taking and got attached to his movies so much i cant think of not expecting a better output from him in his next.... He is a master in movie making and a true gentlemen movie maker. The reason i used the word Gentlemen Moviemaker is that his works needs to be understood but not only watched for time-pass. Every dialog in his movie has a meaning and every frame in the movie has to do something with the plot. In Interstellar, he once again showed us why he is such a remarkable movie maker and a splendid director by delivering the most spectacular experience of a space travel. The depth of the plot is so well handled. Every frame counts and every dialog has a reason. He never even wastes a single second of the film with unwanted stuff. As always, the story is to the point and goes on increasing the intensity exponentially. If i say more about the plot, i may spoil the experience for some who didn't watch it yet. So all i can say is that this movie is masterclass in every aspect.Finally, dedicating his own dialog from The Dark Knight to him, i would like to say..... He is a silent guardian of movie making..... A watchful protector of the script...... A DARK KNIGHT of the industry....... I salute him with all of me and expect many more top notch directional ventures from him.P.S.: I pity IMDb accepts only 10 stars(It may be my exaggeration, but this is what i feel).

"Many plot-holes but a solid work of sci-fi overall, with some worthy moments","First, the good stuff. Black hole and other imagery is top notch accurate, as confirmed last year by real life observations. This is by no means 2001: A Space Odyssey just as Nolan is no Kubrick, but the movie is ambitious and does have strong points. There are a lot of things that make no sense however, first, the nature of the Apocalypse on Earth is completely nonsensical, but on the other side, the oft criticized ending by the scientifically illi terate, makes much more sense than a lot of otherwise blindly accepted parts, especially if you take into account that once you go speculative, you cannot be that wrong. There is some sound strong sci-fi along the way, but a lot of nonsense points have to be given too, though many are saved by the (almost) brilliantly consistent ending, and a lot of sci-fi themes are nicely incorporated and shown, to stimulate imagination in some capable kids.There is also a strong extra point given for respect of the father, as single fatherhood is vastly underappreciated in the wok esick culture of nowaday. The daughter ""scientist"" is celebrated despite of the fact that she entirely plagiarizes work of future generations transmitted by her daddy, which is taken as her modest denial in a culture desperate but unable to obtain wok ef reindly heroines of disciplines for which for many centuries including decades of ins ane positive dis krimination they are proven to be a bit too soft in the head for, a touche, if subtle punch that irritated the ""critics"". Extra point for Matt Damon playing a nas ty man he always seemed to me to be.Overall, a flawed but inspiring piece that can stimulate imagination and scientific curiosity in those who have it, and some emotional roller coaster for the dimw it majority.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Kubrick or Nolan,"In 1968 countless theatre goers walked out of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: a space odyssey. Should have won Best Picture. And here in 2014 IMDb is giving Interstellar an 8.6 rating . I found this latest film over the top unbelievable! And incredibly silly. The top cast did give a good performance, but felt the acting of both Michael Cain and Matt Dillon not worthy of this script. The entire third act was choreographed wonderfully but again unbelievable and extremely hard to follow.168 minutes was also much too long ., could have been edited to 2 hours . I do give creedance to Christopher Nolan his eye to detail, and didn't include audio to outside space travel, just as Stanley Kubrick did for his Space Opera 50 years before, but the overall audience didn't buy that film eithe.Sorry. I give a 6 rating .",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
One of the most tense and mesmerizing films ever made,"I watched this movie a week ago as of this writing and purposefully have waited to write this review and not be biased.First of all the first thing that crossed my mind when I left the session was how much tense Interstellar was. It mesmerized me especially after the crew went to space and it never stopped until the film had ended. I was genuinely curious through the whole film of what was going to happen next. The action scenes were memorable. At times the silence, the pure silence, in some scenes was creepy and I felt that I was genuinely with the crew in the space.There have been a lot of criticism by people to this film because the answers that it gives are ""simple"" and ""cheesy"". When watching the trailers of Interstellar one of my greatest fears was that it was to dramatic in a negative way by some dialogues like ""I'm coming back. When?"". But after seeing the film I was satisfied with the answers that it gave me. In a way you have to be open minded to watch this after all the answers, although simple, are not conventional in anyway and this is, I think, the main reason why so much criticism. But I'm truly opened to accept that when we, as humans, don't know what happens at the first time we do something, the sentiment of fear dominates us.I truly recommend people to watch this movie called ""Interstellar"". For me it was a complete experience which I had not experienced before in the cinema. Maybe you will be troubled by some, or a lot, of the answers that the movie gives, but I think that the visuals on its own are a sufficient argument to see this. I recommend you to relax and not get worried trying to understand everything. It's difficult and maybe you'll get frustrated of how hard, at times, it gets. At the same time it is paradoxical how simple the end is.There are some things that people tend to agree both critics and lovers of Interstellar. For example, that the film is really ambitious. Personally I love when people try so much for something different and outside of the commonplace that we watch everyday and I liked very much those aspects of the films. There are some flaws of the film ? Probably, almost every film has it. Moreover, we, as humans, make a lot of mistakes most of the time. I also think that the aspect of error is being under-appreciated by some viewers. Even in the end you notice how hard and lost you are. But the brilliance, something that really captivated me, was the fact that for this complex problem a ""simple"" solution was given. How beautiful it is when you take a shortcut and resolve a problem in a way which ever be made before.Don't miss this. Love it or hate it, worth the time of watching in a big screen with the sound loud and tense. For me it was a true experience and I hope that you feel the same as me. Cheers.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Good but a bit long,"This is a good sci-fi tale, if you can manage to sit for almost 3 hours, about a mission to save the planet from some disaster (either global warming, dust bowls, or whoever wins the next presidential election). Matthew McConaughey heads the mission, along with Anne Hathaway and a few others I hadn't seen before. They also have a neat robot named TARS. They fly off to find some previous scientists, who have entered a black hole and settled on several worlds possible for human habitation. Matt Damon plays one of the scientists.You have to like black holes, relativity, and the fifth dimension (not the pop group) to appreciate this. I didn't know a thing about this film beforehand, so it was a nice surprise to see Michael Caine pop up. And when William Devane showed up, I instinctively blurted out ""What's in your safe?""The special effects are fine, but the characters are more interesting, and you do want to see how the situations get resolved. McConaughey is good, but he mumbles on occasion, which drives me nuts. I liked the music score, but at times it drowned out the actors.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Not Nolan on his A Game,"Look this is still a good film and my rating system has no actual weight here. Christopher Nolan is a brilliant film maker but lately you start noticing that he is not without his shortcomings.His films are laden with the same tropes especially the massive plot holes. And that was the reason I wanted to see this film, to see what plot hole he had this time and yes they are a plenty.I will still give credit to where it's due. He really wanted to make a head scratcher and this time with the laws of general relativity which the film does closely follow. Basically the emotional device here is that Matthew Mahogany traveling at a fraction of the speed of light through space makes him age slower than his kids and basically its a race against time.However the Nolan-isms come full circle with not-so-subtle foreshadowing, overly pretentious unnatural dialogue, heavy-handed symbolism, a really ear-ringing Hans Zimmer score which make the Inception horns sound like and an unnecessarily long run time.I can see that this is a script he didn't really have time to think through but you can see he tried and its still pretty entertaining. However it's no 2001 A Space Odyssey. He should stick to thrillers. Sorry.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
It's good but not great.,"If you deconstruct the movie then most of its pieces are great in their own way (visuals, music score, casting, acting, story, etc), but the problem for me is that the pieces don't fit together and even overload the whole thing in a baroque-esque way. I like it simpler, but I can enjoy more elaborate movies, though, Nolan's MO is just so recognizable that you can't help to identify the issues while you are watching. His opulent screenplays paired with stunning visuals and grandiose music scores push the inconsistent characters in the background and the plot is kept ambiguous enough to never fully commit to one story and Interstellar is no different. Still it also had a few things to it I liked, for instance, the story concept itself or omitting sound effects in space scenes (like it would be in a real vacuum) or touching on a few political topics with current relevance. So all in all, it's worth watching if you have 3 hours to spare.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Best Movie of this Year!,"I knew something about the plot and thought that it may not be anything more than what I knew. But I was wrong! I was amazed at how Nolan unwrapped one surprise after another and by the time the movie completed and end credits started to roll, I was left speechless for 10 minutes or so. Some of the audience started clapping when the movie endedÂ…some just sat on their chairs dumbstruck! Outside, people were busy discussing the movie that they have just seenÂ…it is a rare sight! I was trying to analyse and understand what I just saw.I need to see it another two times at least to understand this amazing movie better! I need to understand the science the movie has spoken about before I can try to understand it! Nolan has gone a step beyond what we have expected out of him with this movie. I am amazed at how he can reinvent himself every time! Unlike other Nolan movies, this one is strong on emotions as well..at the core it is father - daughter relationship. We had seen only a glimpse of father -son relationship in 'Inception'Â…this one could bring tears to your eyes seeing the performance of the actors. I don't like to give away muchÂ… Some pointers by me..You need to brush up science and know at least the basics like time, black holes, relativity, gravity, etc to understand the science part of this movie.Do not spread spoilers on this movieÂ…let everyone go into the theater with no knowledge of this movie to be amazed like me! Watch it 3 times or more times to understand it better!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
I really don't understand what the excitement was about,"I will begin with the bottom line - yes, the movie is good, it does give you an enjoyable movie experience, and yes you should watch it.And yet, it does not worth it's rate of 9/10. The movie itself is pretty normal with regular scenes and some few scenes which made people really like the movie. These scenes are rather few in number, but are placed in strategic times in the movie, giving it its peaks at the exact time you need it. What most people forget is that the entire movie up to these scenes is just a regular every day science fiction movie. I think everyone is so praising it because their friends are saying it who heard it from their friends and so on...I hope you enjoy the movie but don't be blinded by what other people think of this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A cinematic mess!,"This film is an example of having to many irons in the fire and not knowing what to do with them, which results in an over sentimental mess that is called Interstellar. Nolan finally shows clearly his hubris in that he thinks of himself as a cinematic mastermind, in fact he's just a Hollywood pet with cheap tricks. There is nothing wrong in getting the science incorrect, a competent filmmaker manages to work around the incoherence and still create a unified whole, Nolan on the other hand wants us to think that he understands the science behind Interstellar, but he also shows clearly that he doesn't put much trust in the audiences' intellect.This results in an over abundance of exposition which is there just to inform us of how stupid we are. The sentimentality, which is most of the time laughable, doesn't go along with the overall structure of the film because the plot is disorganized. The problem comes from the inability to transform a concept into a film without allowing the audience to interpret what they are seeing - instead Nolan tries to overwhelm us with his elitist vision and it comes out as a mess because he doesn't trust his audience, he's lack of vision doesn't come from him not having a concept but from the inability to mediate that concept through a film, in other words: he is a bad filmmaker.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A Philosophical Revelation with Scientific Rationality makes this my Greatest Film-Watching Experience Ever,"It's exceedingly rare for a film to make me forget it's a film - but Interstellar managed to knock me out of my senses in a way I had never imagined.Here's the thing about films like Interstellar: the experience of these films starts way before their release, and lingers on in your bodies as a wonderful sensation way after they are over. Christopher Nolan, god bless that genius, announced Interstellar a week after the release of TDKR, and since then, we his fans have driven ourselves mad trying to figure out what Nolan would do with Black Holes and Time Travel and such alike - and what he does is not only brilliant, but beautiful in unthinkable ways.I really need a second viewing to fully be able to appreciate the technical elements of the film, because after a point, really, I was too immersed in the whole experience of it to bother paying attention. But the cinematography, editing, visual effects, set design, the score (Oh, Hans Zimmer!), Nolan's direction, the performances, all combined into a powerful 3 hours that transports you to another universe for the whole time. They did their jobs perfectly so honestly I wouldn't be able to find a flaw.Some have criticized the sound design but I disagree: it was all just so beautiful. So perfect.Nolan raises so many questions in our minds and answers them so beautifully as time goes. I loved this. I absolutely loved this and I implore you to go and watch it and experience and understand what cinema is really, really about.For those who have not seen it, please do not read on. Just go watch it.A solid 12/10 - because yes, it dares to go beyond.***SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT***Let me shrug off the criticism against it: the emotional quotient - 'Love'. ""Love is the one thing that transcends time and space."" It's been said by many that the emotional quotient of this film takes away from the 'other' parts of it, however, the 'many' may not have fully understood what Nolan was trying to say. Think of love as a physical being - an actual something that literally 'transcends' time and space - think of love itself as the fifth dimension beyond time! This whole wonderful journey is the process of understanding this truth, told through the stranded relationship of a daughter and father. Being a student of philosophy myself, this whole concept visualized with scientific rationality is a kind of dream-come-true for me. It is not a film for the pleasure of viewing the film - it raises and answers in its own logic the questions that humankind is yet to find answers to in real life. This film is a realization in the purest sense - this film goes beyond itself, beyond the concept of being just a film. Nolan does the unthinkable: in the never-ending debate between religion and science about the ultimate source of energy for the world, Nolan finds a middle ground.This film is Revelation. Wow. Just wow.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

I am an atheist and this movie is the closest I have ever come to a religious experience, I found it utterly mesmerising and more of a love story between a father and a daughter than an out and out Sci-fi.
That being said this movie is going to age like a fine wine, we will be looking back at this is years to come and discussing it in collages and universities across the world.

Interstellar: The Not-So-Great Nolan Movie,"Like everyone I was psyched out of my mind for interstellar.I was further psyched when I took a look at this movie's rating on IMDb after it's release.This movies has some good elements but you can clearly identify some of the cons of this movie. The best thing about this movie is Matthew McCounaughey who is simply on a roll. His acting was phenomenal. The supporting cast was also great. This movie has a really strong ensemble cast. The score by Hans Zimmer is really good especially because it merges fluently with the dystopian atmosphere of the movie and the visual are a treat for the eyes along with the cinematography. The direction is good and has Nolan's innovative touch.Now with the negatives.First of all this movie is confusing to the average movie goer. It is confusing because it uses a lot of fancy words and scientific terms to cover it's not-so-interesting plot.The movie tends to drag on and the dialogue is not that great. Also the movie is too complicated aside from the terms used in the dialogue. It is proof that just because a movie is different and overly complex ,it isn't great or 'stellar'.

My favorite movie of all time,"There are countless reasons why I love to watch movies, but Interstellar always reminds me why I fell in love with cinema in the first place.There hasn't been a film which hit me as deeply as Interstellar. The story has so many layers to it and essential themes like the survival of our species, pioneering in order to sustain the human race, and ultimately: the importance of love to humankind.Since it is a Sci-Fi-film, I never expected it to be as emotional, philosophical and touching in its core. The most important message it wants to tell us is to grow beyond us and to face the challenges we are most afraid of. Furthermore, sometimes you have to sacrifice something in order to achieve your goals (Newton's third law).The cinematography is one of the most beautiful of all time which leaves you in awe, the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is simple, yet absolutely breathtaking.All actors give great performances, especially Matthew McConaughey as Cooper, Mackenzie Foy as young Murph and Jessica Chastain as adult Murph.Christopher Nolan crafted something special with this film, invested a lot into research for scientific accuracy, which he used to show us never before seen images which are revolutionary and raise new standards for future space movies.A must watch!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Confusion spoils good space yarn,"I watched this on DVD. The first half of the movie seemed like it needed an intro as to why the world was so devastated. Also why there were no threat of violence from gangs hoarding all the resources like most other apocalypse movies? Nice human touch, but not realistic. We don't know anything about the planet except for the slice of life of a dozen people. What happened to the weather patterns? Strike one. How does the space team manage to get their hands on all the fuel needed to launch multiple rockets if there is not even enough food to feed whoever is left on earth. Strike two. The middle of the movie was the best part. Their journey was engaging and scientifically reasonable. The ending with Morse communication was snake oil and mirrors. Where did that multi-dimensional structure come from? Seemed like it came from 2001 Space Odessey. Strike three. The plot leaps from grounded science to Twilight Zone too often for me.

Not much more than a summer pop corn movie,"I'm disappointed. Nolan failed to break out of his mold and make a truly challenging movie. This is one heck of a summer pop corn movie, I'll give it that. But it's not much more than that, and it has perhaps the worst sound design I've heard in 20 years. Nolan himself says in interviews that this is what he wanted -- really loud with dialog that's hard to hear. To make it ""more immersive"" apparently. But if I want immersive, I can go ride my pick of rides at an amusement park. What I want when I go to the theater is for the director to tell a story. And his crappy sound design gets in the way of his telling of his story. And the story is yet another variation on his favorite theme of recursion. Meh. Getting old Chris. Old.

Continuing in Nolan's line, the movie has a long, long introduccion. Yeah, that's not necessary bad, but the problem is you could quit 20 minutes and it wouldn't affect the main characters. Of course, you must to know what you have to dispense.You can see a little poetry in McConaughey's character. As the movies moves on, the character gets tired and so do the actor. Not something bad, even it can be very cool for someone, but I just don't like to see Matthew tired of acting in some scenes in the second but especially in the third.You'll see I'm not criticizing bad things. I'm just saying things that I don't personally like, so it's my point of view.Sometimes the movie tries to blow your mind. And sometimes It makes it. For example, with the last scenes. So, what's my point? My point is that if you're a Nolan fan, go and see the movie.

Humanity can be brutal and beautiful. The way it makes you feel as if you're there having this experience with these characters. I've never really reviewed anything so I probably sound uneducated compared to professionals. I wish I could have first experienced this at a theatre especially imax.

They affects were outstanding, the science was utterly confusing, which is a good thing. I like NOT knowing everything about the science in sci fi movies. It makes the movie more effective.
The music in this movie was almost perfect to the story. I don't think there is anything majorly wrong with this movie.

The characters are so amazing and you go on this amazing journey with Cooper and his team, that you almost feel like a part of the crew.

Rewatched this after expanding my knowledge on science.,I rewatched this after 7 years. The first time I watched this a lot of the scientific stuff went over my head (even though I have a minor in Chemistry). And I felt quite frustrated that I was missing the big picture thinking there were holes in the plot which turned out was caused by my lack of scientific knowledge.As I got older and my love for physics and astronomy grew I was determined to rewatch this movie so it would make sense. Watching simple yet informative You Tube videos which explained Einsteins Theory of Relativity along with multi dimensions helped me fill in some of plot holes.After seeing it again I was just wow. One of the best movies I have seen. Hands down.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The best junk of Nolan,"The story of the film is very touching. If we remove the music from the movie, it will still be a good movie, even a better movie, maybe even a weak point. Well now if we remove the music we see that it is longer. And maybe it will be boring for the audience who likes this big movie several times. The final sequence of the film turns into a package full of long shots. Such a show is repeated in different parts of the film. Even in the views we have from space.Nolan sprinkles a silver and gold color on these shots. Men in spacesuits look much bigger than normal. Matt Damon is not believable enough. But it is good. The sequences size are too long. Nolan tries to make it bearable with music, but he doesn't succeed. I am not against this. But this work also requires a slower rhythm. The pictures are very beautiful. And they often don't look like promotional teasers...",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Best product of Nolan,I dont think so Hans Zimmer knew his own skills. His contribution to the movie is remarkable. The background score was so lit that i actually felt that i was in space. Nolan direction is unquestionable. It could not have been better. It is clear that he has done so much research. Every minor detail of the film was perfectly sculptured. Doesn't felt like it is such long film. Took care of attention to detail. Probably the best sci-fi ever.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"More drama than sci-fi, should have been better.","Christopher Nolan has made some great films, but alas, this isn't one of them. It's not a bad film, but as sci-fi, it misses the target. A film about alien life forms is credible, because it's possible, but a film that mumbles abstract nonsense about a relationship between quantum data, time and five dimensions, that puts a primary character behind a bookcase to observe what's going on in front of the bookcase while unable to communicate through the books had me shaking my head. And then, in what seemed like an eternity later, in a silly and inconvenient way he does communicate. Also, I'm still wondering about the significance of the drone chase sequence. Particularly distracting was when HE rose from the pod. Maybe if I'd known he was in the movie would have prepared me for it, but it came across as an unintended joke. And the constant crying by every one of the characters was just too much. Reportedly costing $165 million to make, the money sure doesn't show up on the screen. For all the questionable raves about the effects, among other things, I wasn't wowed by them at all. A dark color palette full of dull grays was far from inspiring, as good science fiction should be and it came across on the screen as being low budget to me. Visually, it was no Oblivion. The relationships and drama between the characters is the main focus of the film with space and time travel serving only as a device to advance and put some quirkiness into that plot line. As I said, it's not a bad film. Without the lofty expectations of seeing top notch sci-fi from a great film maker, it still had some good dramatic and emotional moments that held my attention, largely because the actors threw their all into it and because Hans Zimmer's great score made some overly long sequences seem way more exciting that they were. Here's hoping Mr. Nolan gets back on track next time out.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A masterpiece,"Interstellar is a near perfect masterpiece. Although the run time can make the film feel a little too long at points and the ending is also slightly drawn out, the film makes up for these flaws and shows why Christopher Nolan is one of the greatest directors and storytellers of this generation. The ideas in the film are very intriguing and make you think for hours after you first view it. Upon rewatch the film becomes even more fascinating because of all the things you might have missed the first time through. The emotion showed throughout the film also improves the story greatly. The stakes of what they are trying to accomplish are shown with this emotion with Matthew McConaughy and Anne Hathaway standing out with their stellar performances. But, probably the most impressive thing about this film is the cinematography and visuals. The visuals are some of the best of any film ever created and are something that really impacts you. So, Christopher Nolan's Interstellar, although with some minor flaws, blew me away with its story, concept, cinematography and exceptional visuals.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Nolan taps into Zeitgeist,"Interstellar is both loved and hated among audiences. It interests me. How can the same film be both praised and derided so intensely? Is it a masterpiece with some obvious flaws, or is it a mediocre film that is propped up by fanboy-ism and bandwagon-ing? For starters, I would just like to say my opinion. I think the movie is fine. It's a little too drawn-out and has bizarre elements, and I think that the message of love is way out of place in such a film.Some people have pointed out glaring flaws in the story and characters, and for them, they are confused and angry that such a film could be considered one of the greatest of all time.So, how did Nolan do it? Well, I believe he tapped into Zeitgeist, or the 'spirit of the times.' He made a perfect storm of a movie, using elements that, on their own are not very special, but combined, they reflect the values of this age.Let's break it down. First off: space. The works of Neil deGrasse Tyson and Bill Nye have fired up new interest in space, and people loved the realistic take on the genre. Second: the message of love. Western Culture almost pivots now around the fulcrum of love, and hate crimes are now considered the most abominable atrocity one could commit.Layer on top of this the cinematography, direction, and style of Nolan, which fanboys have been eating up since Memento. And while I like almost all Nolan films, I think Interstellar is his worst, featuring Nolan-isms dialed up to 11, with philosophical stances on love, life, time, destiny, and humanity's position in the universe.Everyone has a right to like this film if they so choose, and there are reasons to like it. Just please, don't deny the fact that it's pretentious, overly long, and contrived. Recognize that but say that that didn't stop you from enjoying it.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

I'm not a film critic, I'm not able to analyse a film to depth of someone qualified to do so by title, but I love my films and I love being immersed in something that surrounds you entirely. The score (listen to Hans Zimmer's soundtrack on its own, track 8.... mountains...), the cinematography, the worlds created, the scenes on the planets, the black hole, the seemingly interlinked relationship between the earth story and the space story, and most of all, the homage to Arthur C Clarke. I'm not sure why he isn't referenced or out there in discussions that I can find, but a large part of this film was written by him (indirectly!), anyone who's read Odyssey or Rama will know this.

Not great,"This film tries to treat the topic of interstellar travel seriously. Unfortunately, some ideas are presented according to our current knowledge of physics and astronomy, while others are just stupid. This mixture makes the suspension of disbelief, necessary to enjoy such movie, impossible to attain. On one side we have wormholes, black holes, higher dimensions of space and the silence of the void. On the other hand, there is totally unconvincing reality of the XXI century, where farmers are more valuable than engineers (guys, really?) and tomography is (mysteriously) gone. In one scene the physicist explains convincingly the work regime of the wormhole (by the way, this scene is IDENTICAL to the one from the far better Event Horizon). In another, we see the mission robot TARS, being the member of the crew. I know that humanoid machines from fifties seem ridiculous today (like the one from The Day The Earth Stood Still), but they are really the top quality idea compared to the robots depicted in Interstellar. It is difficult to believe someone created such a model and the whole crew agreed to put it the picture! It's almost like the the wooden planet from the initial script of Alien 3...The number of errors and non-logical events is just amazing. Anyone complaining about the lack of consistency in Prometheus (which was also much better than this one) will have the real hunting ground here. In fact, the more time passes after seeing the movie, the more nonsenses are detected. Don't think about this too much, anyway, its not worthy...The Nolan brothers used their imagination a little bit too much in the final part of the story, where the word ""magic"" (interchangeable with ""nonsense"") comes to mind. As the result, the viewer is left at the end indifferent to what is presented on the screen and does not care about the fate of the characters... Please recall the infamous Black Hole, and You will have the impression of what is going on here...The music is of course the extremely important part of every picture. If the composer knows his craft, the soundtrack complements the images, creating the flawless combo (as was in Terminator, Starship Troopers, Aliens, etc.). Here we have the attempt to create the epic atmosphere, but the events shown on screen are rather uninteresting, therefore the resulting impression is just the overwhelming noise, making the viewer angry instead of touching or moving him.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
It's all to do with space and time.,"Interesting set up introduces us to a disintegrating near-future world. There's an intriguing reference to re-writing history, along the lines of Capricorn 1, where planetary exploration is faked in a film studio. McConaughey is the astronaut turned farmer who takes a circuitous, and somewhat unlikely, route back to being a rocket man. Interstellar tries to get the science right but quantum physics doesn't make for the best dialogue. Neither are helped by dropping the spoken track way down in the sound mix. McConaughey's tendency to speak through gritted teeth doesn't help either. Although it looks great and is often very imaginative, the film takes too much time exploring dead ends and detours. At times, it felt a bit like a very long trailer for a very epic series. And it really does seem very long, without ever settling on a unified theme. The time anomaly aspects were good, but too much time was spent getting there.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Inaudible, unclear, unwatchable.","The plot is pretty standard, nothing new at all if you've read enough SF classics. The male cast is good, the adult female cast is awful, a small number of scenes are impressive, the so-called music reminisces of chalk on a blackboard, but all that doesn't matter because...YOU CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING WHEN PEOPLE TALK. Hum, sorry, I was saying that the sound department was run by either a deaf or retarded person. And so is Mr Nolan, who possibly didn't bother checking his final product. The thing that passes for music is that loud. Reading lips sometimes help, but half the talking is through radio anyway, so good luck with that.That's when I realise that Nolan can't actually tell a story through pictures. In many scenes, what is shown is severely shifted from what should be seen, and I would really need the dialogue to explain what is happening, but I can't decipher it because, you know, idiots at the helm. In the same vein, there are quite a lot of inconsistencies and silly concepts. And maybe the writer did come up with acceptable vocal explanations, but I'll never know, because a monkey spilled the background soundtrack all over the track I wanted to hear, and nobody cleaned it up.During the projection, I was seriously and increasingly getting angry at the technical lousiness. That's a first. Hollowood has reached new levels of incompetence.Save your time and money for something made by caring professionals.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

They were all very spectacularly made. It was just a movie that I could just sit back relax and watch and not search for every incorrect miniscule detail. Now it probably isn't the most interesting thing for kids, and the ending makes a perfect storyline go a little wonky.

Truly a film of a decade,"The first time I watched this film I felt extremely underwhelmed. It was boring, dragged out, and too confusing, and I stopped watching before the 3rd act (which Imo is the best act). Maybe 2 months ago I rewatched it, thought I would give it another chance, and it was soooooooooooooooooooo good! The performances were great, the story made sense, and it was one of the only films where I was completely immersed to the screen (along with Jurassic Park, Aliens. 2001: A Space Odyssey and The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring). The visual effects are extremely good, and the writing was great. I felt that the second act was a bit flawed in terms of scripting and directing (imo the weakest of the 3 acts), but is still fantastic nonetheless. Interstellar manages to make you completely immersed into the screen, which only very few films can do. This film truly shows the genius of Nolan making him my second favourite director of all time (favorite being Spielberg). Hands down one of my top 5 films.

Anne Hathaway, was also brilliant, she is extremely versatile. Jessica Chastain really shined in her role, and Michael Caine really added so much so to the movie.Possibly my favorite movie of all time.

Mathew is a fine actor, indeed one I did not like when first I saw him. The journey through the Wormhole was better done in Contact. And how come an ice cloud would not fall?

"So, it's gone","In the era of film shredding, films such as Christopher Nolan's Interstellar seem to be something out of the ordinary. It seems like fiction, which is a lot on the screens, and the actors are recognizable, and the plot is simplest, but no, Nolan knows how to present the story in such a way that neither fans nor opponents of the director can do without thinking about it. Interstellar frightens with its timing - almost 3 hours. About 40-50 years ago, three-hour films, such as ""The Godfather"" or ""Lawrence of Arabia"", were the norm, but in the XXI century the changed pace of life of people affected the fact that it became difficult for viewers to incubate three hours in cinema, so the timing began to be reduced, and moviegoers were already waiting for the release of director's versions. Indeed, after the release of the third part of The Lord of the Rings and Dogville in 2003, 180-minute films disappeared from the screens. But the appearance of the Hobbit trilogy, the Nymphomaniac dilogy, the films Cloud Atlas, Django Liberated, Adele's Life, Hard to Be God, The Wolf of Wall Street and finally Interstellar changed the situation.The film amazed me primarily with the musical component. Hans Zimmer is a genius. His music gives the paintings additional charm. At Interstellar, she excites, fascinates and does not let go. The acting team is great: Matthew McConaughey, who suddenly turned into a really serious actor after playing Ron Woodroof; Anne Huttaway, also the Oscar winner, looks very organic and emotional in the film; representatives of the older generation of actors Michael Kane, Ellen Burstin and John Lithgow - immediately make you remember their old, well-known roles; wonderful Jessica Chastain, although not on the screen for a short time here, makes a great impression; Matt Damon is not immediately recognized: it's hard to believe that this is no longer the young guy from Will Hunting's Smart.The most interesting thing is whether Interstellar will repeat the success of Gravity at the Oscars. After all, in this regard, he has much more artistic merits. Definitely, movies should be watched and drawn independently. It is also unambiguous that the film will surely scold what the light is worth, because we live in an era of saturated viewer, who will no longer be surprised or pleased with anything.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Interstellar: A Journey Beyond the Stars and Into the Heart,"""Interstellar"" isn't merely a film about space exploration; it's a profound narrative that explores the depths of human emotion, the bonds that tie us together, and the sacrifices we're willing to make for those we love. Directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Matthew McConaughey as Cooper, a pilot and father, this movie takes us on a thrilling journey beyond our galaxy in search of a new home for humanity. What sets ""Interstellar"" apart is its ability to weave complex scientific theories with the simple, yet powerful, human emotions of love and perseverance.At its core, ""Interstellar"" is a testament to the strength of the human spirit. It challenges us to consider our place in the universe and the lengths to which we would go to ensure the survival of our loved ones. The film beautifully merges the vastness of space with the intimacy of a father's love for his daughter, making us realize that some connections transcend time and space. It's a story that's as much about exploring the unknown frontiers of the cosmos as it is about exploring the inner depths of our hearts.What makes ""Interstellar"" truly remarkable is its optimistic view of humanity's future, encouraging us to dream big and not shy away from the impossible. It's a cinematic masterpiece that not only entertains but also inspires us to think about the future, the planet, and our relationships. In a world often filled with cynicism and despair, ""Interstellar"" shines as a beacon of hope, reminding us that even in the darkest of times, love and human ingenuity can light the way.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Visually appealing but a little bit too long,"I like movies set in space and involving some element of time travel. Interstellar was interesting to watch but the plot took a long time to unfold. I liked the way certain of the scientific elements of the story was explained to the viewer. However the writing was a little weak and certain plot elements implausible, which made the whole viewing experience a little confusing because is it an action movie or science fiction?The acting was generally above average and the cinematography impressive. I am a fan of Matthew McConaughey especially as he applies himself well in most of his character portrayals. Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain do well portraying the daughter swap central to the theme of the film.The movie also brings about many questions that the viewer may ask, should I go or should I stay? Overall, enjoyable but maybe some better editing would have improved the whole experience.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
An Emotional Intersteller Journey,"I find myself watching this film atleast once a year since it came out, and every time I'm blown away by it. I used to be a HUGE movie junkie, watching atleast 2 movies every single day but as my life has gotten busier I've migrated over to YouTube the home of short attention spans. Nowadays I maybe watch 2 or 3 movies a month and rarely watch something I've seen before but this here is the kind of movie that deserves a rewatch, and another and another. If you've never seen this, which would be weird since it came out almost 9 years ago, then you are in for a treat, granted it will be a bit of a depressing treat but a treat none the less.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Not such a big deal,"We have to start by acknowledging that C. Nolan has been, for a while, Hollywood's golden boy and, as such, people will undoubtedly deify him; such is the dynamic of this strange and absurd system we live in. Thus, we can understand all the hype this movie receives, regardless of its authenticity.As, for me, from the beginning, after the ""ghost"" is mentioned, I saw clearly how that was going to develop; such obviousness scores quite a few negative points for the Nolan brothers' imagination, creativity and originality. Something disappointing, taking in consideration some of the previous works. There's definitely more predictability in this movie than in previous ones, or so was my impression. Particularly, I see a bit too many similarities in ideas, cinematography and even music, to 2001.Apart from that, all that sentimentalism could have been turn down a notch, and clearly the whole ""love"" concept. Still, there's much less of that than what you can find is the vast majority of productions nowadays (something that tells us how low the level of quality of movies and series is). Interesting how Matthew McConaughey was also involved in Contact, a movie that also touches one or two points present in Interstellar. Fortunately, the level of sentimentalism doesn't reach those of Contact and, even better, this movie doesn't dwell in god and such nonsense (something which killed Gravity for me).Although the special effects are no doubt very good, all the talk about IMAX and so on made me expect something much more impressive in that department.The story itself was, for me, a bit weak, and some points seemed to be connected with each others just ""because"", or by very fragile threads. For all the praise I've heard about Interstellar ""science"", I've seen a good few unexplained ""scientific"" events in the movie which just seem to be taken for granted, and I can't see the science behind them anywhere.The fact that this is a story -once again- about how to make humanity survive didn't help my opinion, since there's no real intelligent reason, apart from selfishness and survival instincts, to see our species perpetuated along with its destructive behaviour towards all other lifeforms and itself. That makes me connect to the ""fake moon landing"" scene, and how all these recent NASA movies might be part of some sort of propaganda machine to, once more, makes us look up to the stars instead of caring more for our planet and trying to stop and reverse all the misery we have been, for centuries, bringing upon it and all its inhabitants.Alas, not a bad movie to watch, but certainly not the shining jewel they want us to believe this is. As I said at the beginning, that's how the system (and thus, the masses), work.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
What a Waste of Space,"This truly is a shocking movie and must rank as the worst sci-fi film I have ever had the misfortune to waste 2.5hrs on.The acting is appalling with some quite amateurish edits. The music drowns out a lot of the dialogue, which is probably just as well considering its triteness. The whole premise of the plot seems to have been cobbled together by the writers after they'd endured an overkill of everything from the Lost in Space TV series of the sixties (though at least that show injected some humour into the proceedings), through to 2001 A Space Odyssey, and the innumerable Star Trek programmes and films.Any movie that casts Michael Caine as a scientific boffin must be struggling for starters. He utters, in one excruciatingly and barely decipherable scene, ""I lied"". Well he certainly didn't act! Anne Hathaway struggles to make any sense of the quite ludicrous script and often appears that she'd rather be undergoing root-canal work, whilst Matthew McConaughey mumbles and fumbles his way through lines he can't quite believe he is expected to say.The continuity is confusing and the 'special effects' only reach mediocre, adding absolutely nothing new in this genre for the viewer.I have watched hundreds of sci-fi films and programmes and do realise that we are expected to suspend belief to a greater extent, which is why a little humour would not have gone amiss - but every character in the movie seemed to be so darn miserable and brimming with angst. This film has no redeeming features whatsoever; one develops no empathy for any of the players, and there were a couple I longed would perish within a few minutes of them being introduced into the storyline (the child who portrays the ten-year old Murphy to name but one).Sorry, but this film is not worthy of wasting over two hours of your precious life on. There again, you are quite entitled to think otherwise....",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A complicated subject displayed as a brilliant and digestible masterpiece,"I know nothing about astrophysics or cosmology and I watched this film 10 years ago- I was 14. Throughout the years, I've lost count on how many times I have rewatched this movie.This film tackles about such a complex matter which involves knowledge about different branches of science. As a former 14-year-old sci-fi fanatic, this movie was laid out in such a way that people will understand. While science might not be everybody's thing, this film touches the subject of family and survival; something everyone can relate to.It's a great tear-jerking film that makes people question what they know about the universe and all the possibilities it offers. At some point of the film, it will also make you question your morals and empathize with the characters.Interstellar is a thought-provoking piece that I think is a must-watch for everyone, especially Sci-fi lovers.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Imo if there's any show could be perfect and almost had no mistakes I'd gladly say it's interstellar, no other show did what interstellar did to me, full of emotions that can do deep into your hart and your felling, great soundtracks and one of the best soundtracks of all time, touching stories, fantastic acting, perfect end which has lots of meaning..

I can't believe I waited 10 years to watch this Masterpiece,"One of the best movies ever.I don't know whether I talk about the visuals, the music, the plot, the passion, the love, the drama, the losses or the wins.Lots of things happened and lots of things felt.The father- daughter thing , the belief, the well to live, the love, the desperation, the tough decisions and just so much is there to feel.I feel like if I lived another live.I really can't believe that I have waited ten years to watch the movie. But, I am so happy I did that. Because, in one of my hardest times, I found something to get me out of there and to take me to a better place.Amazing work!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
