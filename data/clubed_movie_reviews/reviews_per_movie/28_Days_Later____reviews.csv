A modern classic.,"Perhaps I'm a little biased. After all, this is set in the city I live and work in, and seeing Oxford Street and Piccadilly Circus, which I pass by every morning and which are usually teeming with crowds of people, completely empty was enough to send shivers down my spine. Usually when you watch a movie like this it's located in some nondescript Midwestern village, which makes it easy to detach yourself from the events unfolding on screen. But seeing them occur in the place you call home is something that gives it an entirely new sense of reality, and one I was previously unaccustomed to.Still, judging 28 Days Later entirely on its merit as a film, it's easy to arrive at the conclusion that it's a fantastic achievement, as well as a coming-of-age of sorts for director Danny Boyle; I can't say the MTV-inspired vanity of The Beach, or the self-consciously trendy posturing of Trainspotting appealed to me, and to my shame I initially expected 28 Days Later to be given a similar treatment. Thankfully, my fears proved unfounded, discarded straight after a opening sequence which is at once effortless and fearsome. The rest of the movie was a joy. A terrifying joy, but a joy nonetheless.It's true that sometimes minimalism can be more effective than overblown bravado, and it's definitely true for this movie. It's the scenes of complete silence which get to you the most; an entire metropolis empty. The grainy picture serves to add a documentary-style quality to the film, which makes the whole situation seem almost too real to bear. Definitely a wise choice to film this on digital video.You will occasionally meet people who thought 28 Days Later wasn't 'scary' or 'gory' enough. These are the same people who will tell you that 2001 was 'boring', or that Memento was 'confusing'. Ignore them. Others didn't understand the purpose of the second half, or were confused by its change of pace, feeling that it distracted from the movie as a whole. However, I personally regard the second half as very important because, as another reviewer pointed out, it makes a very succinct point: What is scarier, the end of the world, or having the world repopulated by maniacs? That, I think, is where the real Horror of 28 Days Later lies.28 Days Later, like the Romero zombie flicks of yore, is ultimately an allegory of the days we are living in, an age in which we are constantly confronted with violence by the media (much like the ape right at the start of the film), where violence begets violence, and humanity faces an uncertain future. I applaud Danny Boyle's bravery in making 28 Days Later because he undoubtedly took a big commercial risk when the majority of the cinema-going public might prefer escapism to words of caution. Remember, Rage is a human-made disease. Quite the allegory there.Like most great masterpieces of their time, 28 Days Later has been misunderstood by a considerable amount of people. I have no doubt it will go down in history as a classic, the one movie which perfectly sums up the confused era we are living in. And even if you didn't like it, it would be advisable to give 28 Days Later another chance; it's a haunting experience when looked at from the right angle. Danny Boyle has many years left in him, I hope he'll continue making more movies like this.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
What makes it different...,"This film is about a virus, 'Rage' virus that makes the infected person mad with extreme rage and hungry for blood. Within 28 days one outbreak in London caused entire Britain dead or evacuated leaving behind a blood-thirsty infected population and a handful of solitary normal persons. Civilization came to a halt, society got destroyed while those limited survivors fight for existence among frequent attack by the vicious victims.Sounds familiar? Then what makes ""28 Days Later..."" a classic among a horde of zombie/biohazard movies? Simply a touch of art that Danny Boyle is able to bring what others could not. The others focus too much on extensive, special-effects-controlled, gory action sequences between infected and normals, with heavy background music. But here there's always a tinge of sadness, emptyness, helplessness. Consider that empty London scene with that background music. We found out there's much else to show than just electrifying action or gore to describe the picture of life in this condition that these movies talk about.There are mistakes and loopholes in this movie. But that couldn't weaken the otherwise tight-gripping storyline. The greatest achievement of this movie is to make one viewer stay neutral throughout the film, without taking any side in the first place. Because the virus we talk about is simply used as a metaphor. 'Rage' is shown as a social disease. That makes it a 'serious' film, not a flick. Every person, even the harshest critic of zombie horror movies should watch this. 5 out of 5 stars.Oh, did I mention Cillian Murphy was awesome?",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"An Existential Drama,with Horror woven in","The 2003 State-side release of Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later"" was advertised as being a shockful scare-fest of a movie. I didn't get around to seeing it until a few days ago and I gotta feel like that was somewhat of an embellishment on the promoters' part.When environmental terrorists attack a lab that contains diseased chimps who are infected with a ""Rage"" virus, they unwittingly let loose a plague that lays waste to England and(perhaps)the rest of society. The 28 Days later of the title cuts to a mostly abandoned London where a coma-tized bicycle courier named Jim(Cillian Murphy,effective) wakes from his stasis to find himself alone in a hospital. As he searches London for signs of life,he is rescued from raging zombies by a couple of survivalists(one of them,the lovely Naomie Harris)who he follows from place to place to keep alive. From there,he also meets a man and his daughter(Brendan Gleeson,terrific,and Megan Burns,good)and they try to find a refuge out of London-town. A recorded message of a ""paradise"" where ""salvation"" can be found is tracked by Frank(the man) on his shortwave radio.This film feels more like a meditation on what happens to people when they are reduced to their lowest elements. A friend of mine told me that this movie's running zombies was what inspired the zombies in the remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"",but where ""Dawn of..."" was pretty much a full-throttle action/horror hybrid from about start to finish,this film plays more like a ""What if..."" movie,with less emphasis on the creatures themselves and more on the (lucky?) survivors. There are also disturbing lessons on the nature OF survival,too.An very interesting and disturbing flick that probably sold itself wrong.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
this movie broke my thumb!!,"No, I'm not kidding. I've been a horror fan for years, but few movies scared me, until one of my friends told me about this one. I rented it, wondering if it was any good, and I watched it. Well, I was very impressed...so impressed that I freaked out during one of the scenes and reached for a pillow, and my thumb snapped back, breaking the bone. Sad, isn't it? This movie is that good. If you can find a movie that can cause you to react and break a bone, then you've found a movie worth watching. 28 Days Later had an amazing plot, great actors, a great director, and most of all, it wasn't like all of the other horror movies. It's now one of my favorites, and one of the best horror type films I have seen.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
one of the best European horror films this decade,"The key to keeping the sci-fi horror genre alive in the cinemas, as of late, is to make sure the material and techniques the filmmakers present is at least competent, at it's average creative, and at it's best something that we haven't seen before or haven't seen in such a style or form. George A. Romero did that back in prime 60s and 70s era of film-making, bringing forth one of the most memorable trilogies of all time for the genre. While many consider Romero to be on any given list one of the greatest horror directors (I included), it is important to know that he too had his sources for his little independent film in 1968, and after that was when he really got inventive, resulting in a masterpiece and a lackluster. Director Danny Boyle and author Alex Garland know that if they were to cook up a yarn all too similar to Romero it wouldn't be satisfying. So, they've done what is essential to the success of 28 Days Later- they take ideas that have been in practice for many years, turn them fresh, and as the audience we feel repelled, excited, terrified, nauseous (perhaps), and enthralled, but we won't leave feeling like we've seen complete hack work.What does Boyle and his team set out to do to freshen up the zombie string? By making not in precise terms a ""zombie"" movie- you never hear ""living-dead"" uttered in this film, although you do hear ""infected"" and a new word for what these people have, ""rage"". Indeed, this is what the infected have in Britain, when a monkey virus gets let loose on the Island, and from the beginning of the infectious spread the film cuts to a man, Jim, lying in a hospital bed, who wanders abandoned streets and views torn fragments of society in front of him. That Boyle implements atmosphere as heavily as he does with the action/chase scenes gives an indication of his dedication to the detail. Jim soon finds a few other survivors, including Selena (Naomie Harris) and a father and his daughter (Brendan Gleeson and Megan Burns) who hear of salvation on a radio and decide to brave it out to find it. When they do, it's a military outpost that's without any true salvation, outside of the various military typos.Like in Boyle and producer Andrew MacDonald's spellbinding (if that's the proper terminology) adaptation of Trainspotting, the craft is on par (or arguably topping) with the story and characters, and thus it has to captivate us all the more so to care about the plight of Jim and his companions. The photography by Anthony Dod Mantle is striking, not the least of which since it was done on digital photography (like in Blair Witch, the use of non-professional camera equipment adds the proper shading when needed), but also many of the shot compositions are different for such a film. The editing by Chris Gill goes quicker than expected in the attack scenes, going so fast between the infected throwing up blood, the screaming on-looker; the new infected transforming within seconds, and then the results that follow. Mark Tildesley's production design, as well as John Murphy's music, evokes haunting, evocative moods even in the more mundane scenes. And the acting, considering not many of the actors are well-known, is more than believable for such a script.I'm not sure if 28 Days Later will be everyone's cup of tea. Some of the horror and science fiction fans out there will immediately hear of this film, see a preview or a TV ad, or even see it, and dismiss it as phooey rubble borrowed from the video-store. I can see their points of view, since I saw many similarities in Romero and some other films (the military scenes reminded me of Day of the Dead, though the chained up Zombie in this was done for more practical reasons, and the supermarket scene is a little unneeded considering the satirical reverence it had in Dawn of the Dead). But what they should understand is that Boyle isn't making a 100% original film, and no one could at this point of the genre's history. He has done, however, the most credible job he could in getting a different tone, a different setting in country, and of a different, enveloping view of the scene structures. Overall, 28 Days Later is constructed and executed like most sci-fi horror films you've ever seen, and like not many other sci-fi horror films you've ever seen combined, in a sense, for a modern audience: fascinating throughout.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"A Cracking Zombie style horror, with substance","28 Days Later successfully takes the zombie genre to a new level, this movie is far more than just a horror flick. There are some great characters, that you actually care about, some you'll like, some you'll be glad to see killed, but all solidly performed.The story is well written and avoids the clichéd cheesy scripts that are too often attached to the horror genre. And I must add that the direction is exactly what you would expect from 'Danny Boyle' top class.For me though the real difference between this movie and many others made in this genre is as follows - The infected (the zombie like folk) are more menacing, they turn instantly and they move fast, a combination that would instill fear in every one of us.I don't mean to run down the zombie movie genre - I am a huge fan of most of these films, but lets be honest its been done to death, re-animated and done again, and this was the first movie to break the mould and transcend to a new level.If you like your horror flicks, then this is certainly worthy of your attention.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
A Pint of Rage,"As it so happens, 28 Days Later is the best zombie movie in the last few decades. Probably since Romero's classics, if I recall accurately. It stands up on its own in a genre which is frequently plagued by a sort of innate stupidity, a consequence of one too many dead people. Otherwise how could one explain the fact that the most acclaimed zombie films are parodies of the genre?28 Days Later shares a striking resemblance with Resident Evil, in that it kind of starts where RE left off: after one of the most exciting intro sequences I have ever witnessed (!), a lonely average-Joe, (Jim in this particular case) wakes up in a deserted London and takes a jolly good walk through the intimidatingly empty streets. Man-kind seems to have been wiped out by a contagious virus which induces a sort of blind rage upon those who fall prey to it. As may have guessed by now, this will be a story of survival.While most horror films will offer a relatively exciting ride with little more than sparse scares, Danny Boyle's movie sheds a new light on the survival instinct of human beings which can damned well spook the living hell out of you - even if not in the traditional sense. Looking at Children of Men might offer some insight into what it feels like to have no future and this itself may clear the way to appreciating 28 Days Later.I guess it's one of those rare horror films which not only enlighten the viewer with nice, gory slaughters but also with a share of psychological goodies. 28 Days Later doesn't forget ""the Master"" either and offers an obvious and unobtrusive tribute to Dawn of the Dead. All around the movie keeps you going because it is an immersive experience and not just a ""poke-your-finger"" kind of experience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Truly Something Special.,"From the music to the atmosphere that is built, this film is in my opinion an influential and perfect film with the acting being just close to beginner level, which would usually throw the film in a lower rating but it adds to the charm here. They feel like real people who are as scared and as lost as we are.The shots throughout london are spooky as it feels so empty and gives this sense of dread. The ending being one of the more sensible and honestly realistic ones to come out of a zombie or ""infected"" films during that time and even now.I watched it again recently and found that the shots being done on a more handheld feeling really drove the sense of panic and supsense home.I will always look back at this film with love and if someone ever says to me, my favourite zombie film. It would have to be this one.It truly sparked the uprise of zombie films and i love it.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
28 Days Later,"This, I have to say, was one of the better viral-zombie films I have seen. The plot was highly un-original, but extremely well made. The acting was powerfully preformed, the filming having many ""diagonally tilted camera view"" scenes, giving off more suspense, without the reliance on the overly used ""scary music"". Also, the addition of the alternate ending gave a strong closing to the film. This is the kind of movie that you end up feeling physically drained after seeing your first time. It will suck you in until the end, every time. I seriously recommend seeing this if you enjoy zombie films, you will not be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Quite good,"I'm amazed there are so many negative reviews of this film; I thought it succeeded on every level. It's artistic and atmospheric, with a great pace, sympathetic characters, and a fantastic climax. The music is very nicely done, and, to me, the eerie opening scenes of the empty London streets are worth the price of admission all on their own. I'm a stubborn viewer, and, normally, when a film benefits from early critical buzz in the manner that this one did, I find some excuse not to like it. But not this time; I'm completely impressed. (Incidentally, I think it's interesting that while most horror films these days seem to have been inspired by knockoffs of knockoffs, ""28 Days Later"" apparently owes more to John Wyndham's classic disaster novel ""The Day of the Triffids"" than to anything else. And that's a good thing.) HIGHLY recommended.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Cillian in his first movie does a great job as Mr. Gleeson and the lovely Naomi Harris were perfect!

"Original first half is followed by a good, but by the numbers second","The story of a plague that has turned most of the population in to crazed ""zombies"" is for the most part a great new twist on the now well worn tale. Danny Boyle has created a wonderful horror classic that takes you into new territory just when you've begun to think you've seen it all before.The first half of this film is some of the best horror film making of the last twenty years or so. Simply put a man wakes up from a coma to find the world in ruins and most of the world now blood thirsty monsters. Staggering around England he ends up with a group of people who try to get out of the city to a safe place in the country. Filled with great set pieces this part of the film raises your expectations for a bang up second half and the genre itself.Unfortunately the military arrive and things shift gears as the movie becomes something else. Its not a totally bad change, what happens is quite good, but after a first half t which effectively rewrites the rules of the genre we get a tale that seems like we've been there and done that. The flight to the countryside becomes literally housebound and it stagnates in ideas that are good but which we've already seen.That said, see this movie. Its a great kick in the pants, even if the second half isn't on the classic level of the first.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Almost felt like two different movies,"28 Days Later is clearly composed of two distinctive parts. The first part deals, in a very dynamic and effective way, of the survival itself after the catastrophe, and one gets easily carried away by the journey of the group. Then, as soon as they get to the military ""base"", the scenario takes a turn, the rhythm, the tension drop, and the atmosphere of the movie shifts completely, not necessarily in a good way, with this storyline of a chaotic society capable of the worst atrocities.While the first part seems rather better than the second, the brutal transition between the two is what stands out, so much that it seems like two different movies. The outcome also turns out to be a bit abrupt and would have deserved a lit more thinking and a better integration with the rest of the plot. It is a shame because there certainly was a more subtle way of associating these elements to create a more logical, fluid and homogeneous movie.Finally, it should be noted that this feature was shot using DV cameras (except for the last few minutes at the cottage) which explains the roughness of the image and its lack of detail.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"Last Of The ""Real"" Zombie Movies","Upon its release in 2002, ""28 Days Later"" made lots of noise as critics called it the scariest film since ""The Exorcist."" Indeed, the movie is quite terrifying. While zombie movies have since edged further towards the action-adventure genre, ""28 Days"" remains unambiguous horror.Director Danny Boyle creates this horrific energy through practical effects that strengthen a suspenseful atmosphere. One of the main ways that zombie movies have transitioned from horror to action in the 21st Century is the increased use of CGI. Nowadays, most on-screen zombies are depicted in massified, computer generated armies. ""28 Days Later"" might be the last time that such infected antagonists look truly real - simply because they are actual actors dressed in decrepit makeup and dowsed in fake blood, moving jerkily against shaky frames for an unnerving effect.The movie furthers this authentic energy through its sets. Like the zombies themselves, the deserted worlds in today's post-apocalyptic movies usually appear digital. ""28 Days Later,"" however, was clearly shot on actual locations. The crew even emptied out massive parts of London to create a post-exodus city. This faithful depiction of a humanless planet makes it all the more believable and therefore eerie.In other instances, the practical sets take the story to more intimate places. Dark hallways, abandoned buildings, and creepy hideouts all render the characters and viewers claustrophobic. Although the story's zombie-creating virus is a global phenomenon (as emphasized in the vacant London sequences) these small-scale settings reinforce the fact that there is nowhere to run.Furthermore, the zombies are not of an overly high or low mimetic. They retain their human mortality, but are unconsciously resilient in their efforts to infect. Because of this, the movie doesn't overdo its zombies, making their selected appearances of greater significance and intensity.Boyle really does offer a master-class in how to create a zombie movie here. ""28 Days"" is enthrallingly scary, visually compelling, and offers all the philosophical muses of post-apocalyptic survival without jamming them down the audience's throat. While the characters could use a little more development, they are all believable enough, and each actor pulls his or her own weight.A couple cherries on top of this movie are John Murphy's music (""In The House¬ - In A Heartbeat"" is a superb score) and its distinct Britishness. Like Robin Hardy's ""The Wicker Man,"" ""28 Days Later"" would be somehow less effective if it weren't an English production. Watching a place as developed and orderly as the UK fall into disarray is uniquely uncanny, thus adding to the fear factor.If only more films in this genre could've followed ""28 Days Later's"" lead in the past couple decades. Then, we'd have more quietly brilliant zombie movies rather than unremarkable videogame imitations that prefer action-packed extremity to subtle cinematic thrills.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Waste,"Got this movie on a recommendation that it was ""My favorite movie of all time""........ Impressed with the start and it reminded me of a 70/80's series i think called survivor....The London scenes worked well and i for a time thought i might be in for a chiller about what you would do if a handful of people were left.... The music gave the clue that all was not well and what was promising fell apart when they contacted the Army north of Manchester...In the face of attacks by the infected would an army unit act in such a way...i don't think they would...add an unresolved ending and it was a mess. As a zombie movie fine..but after such a good start a waste of a subject that hasn't been taken to a conclusion of what you would do if you were left alone...that would be more spooky.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"Uneven horror film, but with occasional flashes of sheer brilliance","Back in good old Great Britain, Danny Boyle proves that he's still a gifted filmmaker even though his short Hollywood career wasn't as fruitful as initially hoped for. The opening sequences of this ""28 Days Later"" are downright astonishing and  for a moment  you suspect that you're about to watch to most brilliant horror film in a long, long time. Especially the already classic sequence in which Jim (Cillian Murphy) wanders through the entirely deserted streets of the otherwise so lively and crowded London, guided by disturbing music, is efficiently creepy. The plot centers on an extremely aggressive virus that turns people into blood-crazed maniacs. It's only 28 days since the virus was unleashed and the entire population is wiped away already, while a few lonely survivors desperately prepare for the total apocalypse. Jim is one of them, as he just awoke from a coma, completely unaware of the vile events that took place the past 28 days Even though the story isn't very original (Romero's ""The Crazies"" come to mind as well as ""Last Man on Earth"" and ""The Omega Man""), Danny Boyle succeeds in portraying a gripping mix of drama, action, suspense and  oh yes  gore! Now, I really wished I could end my user comment here and conclude that ""28 Days Later"" was a simply great new horror film but unfortunately the script takes a complete U-turn halfway and becomes a repetitive lesson in which Boyle and writer Alex Garland try to convince us that mankind still remains the biggest threat of all. The last survivors end up at a military post where their lives are even in bigger danger. The tension and carefully built up atmosphere disappears and is replaced by tedious macho speeches and gratuitous brutality. The acting performances in this film aren't very spectacular but that's understandable considering most cast-members are debuting here. The fact that this project was entirely filmed with digital cameras might be a nice trivia element, but I'm not too keen on this type of cinematography. Overall, Boyle's film is worthy viewing for horror fans but experienced fanatics won't be too impressed.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

This is my all time favorite zombie movie,"28 Days Later (2002) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows a man in a coma who wakes up to an empty world filled with flesh eating zombies that are infected with a strange virus. As he runs into survivors he looks for ways to both survive and find hope for a means to normalcy.This movie is directed by Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire) and stars Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins), Naomie Harris (Skyfall), Brendan Gleeson (Cold Mountain), Christopher Eccleston (Thor: The Dark World) and Megan Burns (Liam).This is my favorite all time zombie movie. The opening scene in the laboratory with the monkeys was a perfect way to start the film. Every scene was intense and very smart from the second the main character wakes up in the hospital. The cinematography of the empty city was well done. The depiction of both how you can get infected and how the infected behave was tremendous. There are some legendary scenes in this - the crow on the wire, the scene at the parents house, the church sequence and of course the ending is brilliant. This movie does a great job of how humans really act in times of crisis, the depiction of the military men was a microcosm of that. The soundtrack is tremendous and the relationships between characters were awesome. I really loved both the daddy/daughter relationships and the subtle love story. The ending and twist was brilliant.Overall, there's nothing to not like about this movie and it's definitely a classic. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
great movie spoiled by a silly ending,"I agree with the last poster and was overwhelmed for the first two thirds or so which struck me as feeling starkly realistic in style, and then severely underwhelmed by the ending which I thought was very po-orI really thought once they found the compound that the plot would branch off into some interesting territory, instead it goes all Hollywood on usForgetting about the ending, the movie still has a lot going for it including some solid acting. It also combines creative visuals, music and sound. The film has a surreal silence for the most part, creating a claustrophobia which I really liked. This contrasts nicely with the bursts of noise during rage attacksAlso some nice details like the Foley on the eye opening at the startPity the ending wasn't approached differently, but you can't always have everything, and overall I got a lot more than I was expecting.

Great Beginning of the 'Infected Zombies' Sub-Genre,"This was a film that I remember seeing in high school. My father took the family to see it in the theater. It was a rare film that we all really enjoyed. I have owned this film for a while, but I had never reviewed it. I did get to see it again in a theater on a 35mm print and then another rewatch for the Summer Challenge Series for the 2000s run on the Podcast Under the Stairs. I'm now giving it another rewatch for Where to Begin With on the TPUTS Collective.Synopsis: four weeks after a mysterious, incurable virus spreads throughout the UK, a handful of survivors try to find sanctuary.We kick off with a group of activists that are trying to free chimpanzees. They are being tested on and we see one of them strapped down, forced to watch news footage of war. The activists are told to not release the apes as they are infected with something. They do it anyways and the woman is attacked. This rage they're infected with is highly contagious.It then shifts 28 days later, to a hospital room. Jim (Cillian Murphy) is naked and he finds the door to his room locked. A key is on the floor and he is all alone in the hospital. He picks up cans of pop and ventures out into London. He finds that the whole city is abandoned. He seeks refuge in a church where there are countless bodies. He calls out and draws the attention of those still alive. I have to say, this is one of the scariest parts of the film. A priest then comes out and attacks him. He fights it off with his bag of items. He flees and is saved by two masked individuals.They turn out to be Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley). They fill him in on what they know about the infection that has turned everyone into aggressive mindless zombies. He is told that it is contracted from saliva or blood. It isn't safe to go out alone or at night. Jim is determined to find his family, even though the other two know they are dead. It is decided to come with him. It is afterwards they find other survivors in a high-rise building. It is a father, Frank (Brendan Gleeson), and his daughter Hannah (Megan Burns). They can't stay here as their water supply is exhausted and a broadcast gives them hope for salvation. This might not be the salvation they are expecting though.That is where I'll leave my recap and introduction to the characters. I'm assuming most everyone has seen this film by now. It is the rare case that so many people, horror and non-horror fans alike, have seen. I recently heard a podcast that said it is not only one of the best British horror films in the modern era, but one of the best of all time. It is commonly found in many of the best zombie films of all time as well. I know it falls into that subgenre, but these aren't zombies. They are infected people. The corpses aren't dying and reanimating. They are instead infected with rage, which seems to be a form of rabies. I won't harp about this too much but wanted to get that out of the way.From that though, what I enjoy about this film is the deeper look at humanity we get. Jim has been in a coma it seems for some time. Now I question how long, because if it's been the full 4 weeks, he would have trouble. He would probably die of dehydration. I'm assuming that it hasn't been the whole time as it would take some time for the infection as well. There would be issues with his muscles as well that would take time to work out. None of these ruins it though. I did look up after this viewing, this would have come out ahead of the Walking Dead comic. Makes me think they borrowed the beginning with Rick Grimes.Back to the original point I'm trying to make, Jim wants to find his family and he also wants to help others. This hasn't jaded him like it has for Selena. She is interesting, because when we first meet her, she believes that surviving is all that life has become. This bleak look makes me wonder what the point of living would be then. Is just surviving enough? Later in the film we meet Frank and his daughter Hannah. He is convinced that everything is going to be made right. Hannah seems to think so as well, but there's nativity from her age. She is leery of this other duo that shows up at first. As they go, we see that Selena softens while Jim has a much darker turn. I love what he becomes in the frame of the movie. Hannah also goes through a similar change as she is jaded during her stay at the manor.There is then another side of humanity we get from the soldiers that they end up meeting with. I do believe that even as short a time as a month, it would break down like it has. There is the aspect of mob mentality that these soldiers think in the collective and again, with nothing to live for than just survival bothers them. It really tests a person when laws breakdown and you can live without repercussion.Next this brings me to the acting. I thought Murphy was great. Since he was asleep when this started, he still maintains his humanity. His turn during the climax is excellent. It is my favorite part of the film. Harris is also solid. She has a different turn. She becomes more of a human the more she gets to know those around her. I thought Gleeson was solid. There's a positive feeling and what happens with him still makes me sad even though I know what is going to happen. Burns works in her role. She is quite funny during the climax as well. I thought the soldiers as a collective were good and what happens with them is believable. All those that play infected people did great and round out for what was needed.To end this out, let's go to filmmaking. This brings me first to the effects. They were all done practically from what I remember and it shows. They look phenomenal and that helps to make the film feel even more real. The blood looks real. The disease is handled in a realistic way and I could see something like this happening. Going along with this is the cinematography and the framing. There are excellent shots throughout. That adds to this.Next is pacing which I was surprised to see that this runs for almost two hours long. It doesn't feel that way. I think it is paced in a way that is solid. Things are introduced in an interesting way and the tension is constantly ramping up. From when Jim wakes up you are given that eerie feeling since he is in a major city and there is no one around him. You keep getting that feeling that nothing is safe until the film ends, which is good for the mood. I thought the ending was fitting as well. Another aspect that helps is with the music which I'll go into next. This is something else that just adds to the atmosphere. The score enhances the scenes and helps with building tension. I absolutely love the selection for the climax of the film. I listen to it while writing sometimes and it just takes me back to that sequence. I am a big fan and it is one I come back to quite a bit while writing.In conclusion, this might be my favorite infected 'zombie' film of all time. We get the great story and build-up of how all of this happened. Seeing how these people are trying to survive feels realistic. The acting helps to bring this to life as does the effects of those that are infected. This is well-made from the cinematography to the soundtrack. It helps to capture this eerie feel of a potential apocalypse to these characters. If you haven't seen this one, I would recommend it, if you're a fan of the genre or not. It is that good and the look at humanity is relevant.My Rating: 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Creepy and eerie  return to   bloody zombies,"This is a good horror film . It's made by means of videotape , the cinematography , musical score by John Murphy and direction by Danny Boyle are nice . The movie begins with a spooky images , a city without people , totally uninhabited . Later on , it continues with fights between starring Clian Murphy and the zombies helped by Naomy Harris . After that, they meet Brendan Gleeson and his daughter.The misfit group go out from London, looking for some people .The trip is very dangerous, they hold too many risks , Zombies attack anywhere. They arrive a place which they believe it is sure but the surprise will be that the shelter is much worst that they have thought.This moving film contains chills, thrills, horror and lots of blood and gore . The flesh-eating mutants appearance deliver the goods plenty of screams, shocks and tension . The horror moments are compactly made and fast moving . The make-up assistants create a truly frightening zombies . Terrifying and astonishing frames about apocalyptic events with deserted streets , and creepy mood at London without people totally uninhabited , similarly to classics movies, such as ¨Quatermas and pit¨, ¨Omega man¨ and ¨Lifeforce¨.It packs an atmospheric as well as evocative cinematography by Anthony Mantle and a thrilling score by John Murphy . The film well written by Alex Garland was compellingly directed by Danny Boyle and followed by a pretty good sequel titled '28 weeks later' by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
The UK perspective,"Rating: TBC (lets face it, its an 18 and then some) Stars: Mainly unknowns, and Christopher Eccleston Theme: Horror/Sci-Fi/Drama Language/Nudity/Violence: Very bad language, huge amounts of violence (once sexual) When Hollywood made The Beach they gave it the usual Hollywood spin. 28 Days later is what happens when you actually let Alex Garland write the screenplay. Set in a quasi post-apocalyptic world, a virus has been let loose on an unprepared public by ill-judging but well meaning animal rights activists. It is made perfectly clear in the prologue that this is not a film for the weak of heart, or even the moderate of heart. And even the strongest stomachs can expect to be tested.The Vanilla Sky sequence around a deserted London is one of the creepiest things you will have ever seen on screen. Not only will it encourage the tension and dread that the film is trying to draw out of its unsuspecting audience but it will force you to try and work out how on earth they managed to shut the entire city down. Until this point the movie has been relatively slow, but this is all about to change as the story really kicks off. It would be unfair to the film to reveal much more of the plot after this point, and even more unfair to the potential audience.The cast is made up of unknowns and faces that you are sure you have seen before somewhere, but just can't place. Whether this confusion was intentional in the casting or not I'm not sure, but it certainly enhances the overall sense of displacement. Christopher Eccleston's appearance later in the film awards him with the entrance that all actors would like. Unfortunately he spends most of his role looking slightly embarrassed about being in such a trivial movie, only once enjoying himself as he torments a captive. There will not be any best actor Oscars winging their way to the cast of this movie, but they're acting ability isn't really what the movie is about. They are all perfectly acceptable as their characters, with Jimmy being the standout performance. This is a mood movie that is designed to mess with you head but not allow you enough time to work out the answers.28 Days Later is essentially I high budget, intelligent and deeply scary horror film in the vain of many a 1950s B movie. This is not Eight Legged Freaks (Arach Attack), but comparisons could be made. It is darker, less humorous (although not devoid of humour), and definitely British. The main difference between this and the last decade worth of horror movies is just how possible it really is. This is not a spoilt brat slasher or alien invasion movie, this is a tangible danger that is no leap of imagination to consider real.Mark: 9/10Who to go with: Someone big and strong to hide behind.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
A Raw Zombie Movie,"28 Days Later"" is a gripping and raw zombie movie that left a lasting impression on me. Cilian Murphy's outstanding performance, especially with the iconic dialogue ""hello,"" added depth and intensity to the film. The setting in London and the UK was skillfully captured, considering the modest budget of 8 million USD, resulting in stunning shots of an empty and desolate city.The film brilliantly explores the true nature of humanity, shedding light on how institutions provide a false sense of security while individuals pursue their own motives. The underlying theme of human beings turning against each other, dating back to the inception of civilization, adds a thought-provoking layer to the narrative.However, there were some aspects that left me wanting more. The family's willingness to help the main characters seemed too good to be true, creating a slight disconnect from the otherwise realistic tone of the film. Additionally, the protagonist waking up in an abandoned hospital without a trace of blood felt a bit too convenient, stretching believability.The ending, while not as satisfying as the one in ""World War Z,"" still left an impact but could have been more powerful with some additional depth and resolution for other characters. The scene where Jim and Miller take on their enemies together seemed a bit forced and could have been better developed. Moreover, using a car for escape in a real zombie apocalypse seemed implausible, considering the likelihood of jammed highways with immobile cars.Overall, ""28 Days Later"" delivers an intense and thought-provoking zombie experience, but some areas could have been further explored to enhance the movie's impact. Despite these minor shortcomings, the film stands as a noteworthy addition to the genre and is worth watching for its engaging storytelling and impressive performances.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Flawed but thrilling British horror movie,"In England a group of animal rights activists break into a research facility to free monkeys.  However the monkeys are infected with a new developed virus called rage which is contagious by blood or bodily fluid - at the same time Jim lies in a coma.  28 days later Jim awakens from his state to find London deserted and populated only by a group of those infected by rage. Jim is rescued by Selena and her friend who tell him what has happened and start a search for other survivors and a quest to find the cure, promised by a military unit stationed in the north.I excitedly arrived at the preview for this looking forward to a tense British horror movie to make me jump with fear.  I got pretty much what I wanted.  The plot is simple and omits much detail but not to it's disservice.  Details as to what the virus is or what it was created in the first place (by putting monkeys in front of TV's Clockwork Orange style?) but the detail is not important seconds into the film when we wake up with Jim.  At this point his fear becomes ours and what is important to him is not the detail but the bigger picture of the infected and the chances of survival.The plot is told in two parts.  First the big picture in London and then the smaller battle north of Manchester.  Both are well told but for different reasons.  The bridging section of the journey north is good as it helps us know the characters better.  Of course is it scary?  Well, not scary but thrilling all the way.  To me scary is things like Ringu - creepy stuff, but most will be freaked by 28 days later.  The infected are not zombies in definition or in action - they move silently and fast and with pure blood lust. I was always more scared by zombie flicks than anything else becomes they keep coming - here they do the same but fast!The direction is good for the most part.  The opening scene in London just shows how badly Crowe did his bit in Vanilla Sky.  Here it is clever and chilling to see much of London totally empty.  The direction is better when it is fast cutting and handheld style.  We see things like the characters would see them out of the corner of their eyes, a flicker, a shadow etc and it works to great effect.  The only downside is that, at one or two points, the attacks were signalled by a preceding talking 5 minutes, but this is minor.  The final rain soaked action is excellent - fast, gripping and paced.  This film doesn't rely on gore or special effects (although it is there) instead it has genuine tension and fear.The film is very British.  It is very low-key and realistic.  The survivors are not Mad Max style heroes but people clinging to life by a thread or setting up survivalist measures that simply don't work.  The ending is not as good as I had hoped but it wasn't bad and it fitted with the tone of reality that Jim had realised when lying on his back in the woods towards the end.  It's not without flaws but the film is a very good British horror film - Americans will wonder `where are all the teenager girls to scream' or `why don't they all have guns' or `why is there no real dah-dah music to tell us when something is going to happen' but that is because this is a British film and not Hollywood.Most reviews have praised the `unknown' cast.  Well I agree the cast did very well - but unknown?  Murphy certainly is not unknown (and won't be from now on) and he does Jim very well, from when the truth is first real to him, to his decision that he must learn to kill through to his transformation near the end.  Harris is excellent again, I say again as she did well in miniseries `white teeth'.  Her accent is British and she plays a younger role but she is a good actress.  Brendan Gleeson is good in a fatherly role but Eccleston seems clipped and at odds with his military role.  In fact all the military guys were laddish caricatures and only just did the job - but I never believed in their characters as I did with the others.Overall I was glad to see this early.  I really enjoyed it, the pace at times may have been uneven but to me that added to the tension - an attack could come at any time.  The eventual small scale focus helped the tension and pace of the story.  Thrilling, scary, tense and well written - even more surprising is that it's home grown!",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
One of the best 'zombie movies' ever made,"The movie is about a post-apocalyptic England where a virus has spread through the population turning those infected into sprinting rage-filled zombies.Unlike some other reviewers, I think that the shaky camera work works well. It has to do with building anticipation for the next zombie encounter. Themes are able to establish and characters can be developed because we know that at any moment a raging zombie might enter the picture.My only complaint against the movie is the ending. It's as if Jim has spent months fighting for survival. Maybe he's carrying the virus all along but a genetic mutation is preventing him from turning.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Not your typical brain obsessed zombies.,"My favorite zombie movie and most realistic zombie movie in my opinion.On my third re-watch of this movie I can confidently say that it's gonna be a classic (especially considering how it looks out of this century). I like the good old vintage film look, but not in a full length movie like this. I wish there was a higher quality version of this movie.Gut wrenching start, great soundtrack and a different twist on the zombie concept make this movie great. The alternate endings are also worth a watch.I understand why some people may not like this movie. I didn't find it quite that good either until my second watch.I did not like was the generic apocalyptic forced romance between the protagonists.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
A rude awakening...,"""28 Days Later"" does deviate somewhat from the stereotypical zombie movie genre. And whether or not that is a good thing or a bad thing is, of course, a matter of personal preference. I did, however, find it to be a refreshing approach to the genre. I liked some parts of the movie, and I disliked others.Director Danny Boyle took a bold approach to the genre when he came up with this zombie movie or viral infection movie, call it what you will. And it was an approach that resulted in a fairly entertaining movie, which did bring some new and interesting things to the genre.What works in favor of ""28 Days Later"" is the storyline and the way that director Danny Boyle told the story. It is a fast paced story that is driven by a solid story, good characters and equally good acting performances.However, I am not personally a big fan of having fast, agile and running zombies. But since these aren't zombies as such, then I guess as an infected person it is alright. But for the genre, then I would classify them as zombies, and as such running is a no go.I mentioned that the storyline is good, and it is the heart of the story, and the writers did put together a good story which is thrilling and entertaining. It was a thrill ride to follow Jim (played by Cillian Murphy) from waking up in the hospital and throughout the movie right up to the end.The effects in ""28 Days Later"" are quite good, and that is something which also helps the movie quite a lot. You can't really have a zombie movie, infected people movie, or whatever this was, and not have proper effects. So thumbs up to the special effects team for their work on ""28 Days Later"".Usually I am not one who pays much attention to music in a movie, unless it is awfully bad and overshadows everything else. But the music they opted for in this movie was actually good and did help to supplement the movie quite well.If you enjoy zombie movies and want something fast paced that deviates from the stereotypical how-to-make-a-zombie-movie recipe, then give ""28 Days"" a chance.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Pulse pounding excitement with dead skin.,"If your looking to find a film that captures the bleak and hopelessness of a fallen civilisation, it's 28 days later. Danny Boyle has nailed the apocalyptic setting, the slow plucking of a guitar, symbolising what once remained of humanity (both figuratively and literally) aswell as the violent strums with heavy bashing of drums being the violent nature of the infected.Zombies/infected are fast and visceral, the handheld chaotic style of filming along with the higher shutter speed accentuates the horrific nature of the RAGE virus.Even though some may complain about the visual quality of the film, it's more so a stylistic decision that separates other zombies films that tend to have more of a clean look. It's what creates the films unique identity in an otherwise overpopulated sub genre.The story is personable and believable, Cillian Murphy is fantastic as Jim, waking up from a comatose state, entering hell on earth. Just as he is experiencing everything, we as the audience also share this journey with him, discovering for ourselves how the world fell to a deadly pandemic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"28 Days Later is the perfect horror movie, combining the rough, the beautiful, and the purely cinematic.","What stands out first is the unique quality of the footage, shot on foggy digital cameras, lending an almost dreamlike quality to the post-apocalyptic landscape. Such footage also lends itself to tight, intimate shots; strange angles, often reminiscent of security camera footage; and dynamic editing furthering a realism with almost the impression of a documentary or twisted home video.This sense of realism is further pushed by the acting and dialogue. The sense of humanity is constant. It exposes the shortcomings of so many other horror films in which characters can only scream in terror or grow serious in their struggle against it. Instead, in this film, there are times to scream but also times to laugh; times to brood but also times to smile with a renewed optimism; times to be left alone but also times to let yourself love. In many ways this is a central theme of the film: holding onto those human moments, the dumb joke, the chocolate from the super market, hope in the future. The struggle against zombies parallels a struggle against nihilism.There's a lot to take away from this film, but somehow what I'm mostly left with is the impressions of its haunting imagery: a church full of dead bodies, memories of the past portrayed as film projections on the wall, the emptiness of the London landscape. The horrifying ambiance of liminal space, empty, quiet, followed by the buildup of visceral and brutal music.The movie's most horrifying moment for me comes when a survivor tells the story of his father and sister getting trampled at a train station, seeking to flee the city at the start of the infection. The story is recounted stoically in a quiet corner store. The survivor describes the look in their eyes, the fear in himself, the terrifying moment of deciding to leave them and climb to survival over the rest of the crowd.A lesser director would be tempted to depict this scene, to make it real: show you the horrified faces, show you the crowd of trampled people, show you their dramatic struggle to survive. Certainly this could have been achieved to dramatic effect. Yet, somehow, it's so much more off-putting when the film doesn't give you the relief of seeing it. Doesn't give you the screams, the emotion, the visuals of this nightmare scene. You don't get the catharsis. You get a broken man describing it in a dark corner store.The grainy quality of the footage perhaps mirrors a deeper understanding of what detail to show, and what details to leave to your imagination. It pulls at our deepest fears and leaves a sensation of just how special a movie can be.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
28 days later is a classic end of the world movie.,"28 days later begins I think much the way a sequel to Resident Evil the movie would begin. Jim wakes up in a hospital bed surrounded by drips and wires but no people, he gets up to find the door of his hospital room has been locked and the key pushed under the door. He puts on some clothes and makes his way through the hospital, it is completely deserted. As is the streets which are littered with rubbish, he begins to collect things off the streets he feels he may need, drinks, and even money, he carries them in a plastic bag, it is so quiet you could hear a pin drop. He makes his way through the city until he comes to what seems to be a shrine, it is covered in pictures of 'loved ones' the pictures include photos of families, even young children. Jim still doesn't know what has happened but things are beginning to piece together bit by bit. Common sense tells him something has taken out the population although he doesn't know yet it was a virus. He enters a chapel, as he walks along the upper balcony he looks down over the 'congregation' to see bodies scattered around everywhere, there doesn't seem to be anyone left alive, that is until Jim says 'Hello'...28 days later is a classic end of the world movie. These type of movies are my favourite kind of thriller. As I said before if you have seen Resident Evil the movie I am sure you would agree that this movie could almost be a continuation of what would happen with a sequel to it. The scariest thing for me about the movie was the speed of the infected. They are much like zombies, once the virus enters the bloodstream the victim becomes infected within 10-20 seconds, not much time to say your goodbyes. However these 'zombies' move fast, gone are the days of movies like 'Day Of The Dead', where if you had to you could just run past your attacker! Once these critters are on your tail they are hard to shake off.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
The first hour was fresh and entertaining...then comes the climax and there goes the picture.,"""28 Days Later"" stands above the typical horror movie, and by a lot too. Unfortunately, the average horror movie is so bad, that this would have to be terrible not to be better. This is actually really good for a horror movie. It has realistic acting, characters we care about, scary antagonist zombies that lead to several heart racing scenes and dialogue that's just fine. The climax is what brought this movie down a notch. It was loud, and nonstop, and everything that defined what the first part of the movie is, is not used in the climax.After an outbreak of an infectious disease, the world's population is moving away from humans and now is being lead by brain dead and blood hungry zombies. Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up from a coma 28 days after this disease took hold of the human race. He ends up meeting other survivors, including Selena (Naomie Harris), a tough woman who will kill anyone infected in a split second, Frank (Brendan Gleeson), and his daughter Hannah (Megan Burns). These few survivors go off to find more survivors and end up finding a military base where the study these zombie creatures by chaining them up. Chaos ensues when one gets loose.The first part and good portion of this movie is different from most horror films. It's quiet, except for zombie attacks which will catch you by surprise, and the characters act very reserved, but it's not boring. It's like a character study, and the characters are interesting. Instead of showing lots of zombie violence (which it does have some), it's more about the characters and how they're coping and what they're thinking. Once on the military base, this movie takes a turn for the worse. It grows overly violent, and the climax is equivalent to a bunch of loud screaming while throwing blood and guts at the camera. This type of climax works better in comically violent films, such as Peter Jackson's ""Dead Alive"" or Sam Raimi's ""Evil Dead II"", but here it's a step in the wrong direction. Then we get to the ending. It may not be anything new, but it's an effective and good ending.I enjoyed everything about this movie, except for the climax. But even with a climax like this has, this is an exceptional zombie movie. The acting and writing are realistic and the characters created are ones we care about. The direction is good, as is the camera direction. Much better than the sequel this movie produced. Overall, this is a similar plot (The Omega Man) but it brings enough new to the genre to make it a success.My rating: *** out of ****. 113 mins. R for violence and language.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Three Course Meals,"I expect I will stick with Danny Boyle no matter what, because ""Sunshine"" has changed me. I like what he does, circumnavigating zones of cinematic expression. He does it in the jumps from project to project, seemingly exploring both the depth at the center of each lake and its bounds.But he does it within each project as well, working the overlay among what we seem to need to keep straight as separate genres. I'm not sure I really understand much about the necessity of genres. Surely they are a narrative necessity: a film only lasts a short while and you have to insert yourself into it quickly, filling in all sorts of context along the way based on established assumptions. But there's also the familiarity of stories that goes beyond film, indeed beyond all art and forms the basis of action in life. Art merely acknowledges these stories and is allowed to play with them a bit. Not too much, mind you, which is why combining and overlaying stories is so effective.And that's what Boyle seems to understand so well. Its more than just being capable cinematically. He seems to find cinematic means in the overlap of these genre inspired strokes. In this case, its literally three genre-strokes in three acts. It isn't life-changing, but it is a bit exciting seeing how he can shift us from thrill to adventure to revenge to romance without too many bumps. Well, maybe that last one was a bit rough.But he takes chances. And he enlists his actors in them, so there is an overlap as well among himself, his actors and their characters.There was only one annoying thing here. When a character knows he is being stalked, and the stalker passes quickly in front of the camera so we know he is there but the character does not, there's this swoosh that first appeared in slasher films and is just lazy.(The shopping scene references ""They Might Be Giants."")Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Original and impressive,"28 Days Later is a brilliant genre-defying film wrapped in a shoebox budget. The world is in ruins, and humanity's days are almost over. The story follows a group of survivors trying to outlast the aftermath of a rage epidemic. The film really gives a new definition to the term 'zombie' because they are not portrayed as slow and undead. These zombies are super fast and very much alive, which increases fear factor. Unlike regular superhero movies, the characters had more believable qualites that were well established, making the story more in touch with reality. The gripping events that build up to the climax were very effective as they are terrifying. Some of the chase scenes were short and under-developed, they weren't satisfying enough. Overall, I would still recommend 28 Days Later for a thrilling night in.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Effective and creepy flick,"Shooting this on digital video was the best move Danny Boyle made with this violent and quite creepy movie. It gives the movie a look as bleak and oppressive as the story it tells. Its vicious looking, cold and picks up on every detail. It puts the action, and every drop of blood, right in your face, and that sets it apart from (and lifts it above) the standard set by most Hollywood movies in its genre (Dawn of the Dead remake, Land of the Dead). The hand-held 'shaky-cam' makes for an extremely hyper-kinetic cinematography, and that conveys to the attacks by the 'infected' in their unstoppable rage. And to the desperation so well portrayed by the actors both during safety, but also during fights. Selena hacking away at an infected with a machete is particularly nasty.Personally I have always preferred slow zombies over fast moving like the ones from Nightmare City or the new Dawn remake, as the slow make for more hopeless situation and desperation. (you can run, but you cannot hide) The ability to outrun zombies makes for a perfect sense of safety even though there is none.Although the 'infected' are not zombies, they are in the same ballpark. In this case their ability to move fast and make chase only help empathize the force that drives them. Pure rage. Any other emotion and self perseverance is completely gone, and that makes for some truly psychotic and terrifying antagonists. Times have changed (unfortunately) and extras aren't a buck a dozen anymore, and due to the films small budget, we never get a massive amount of 'infected' on screen at any one time and that takes away at the apocalyptic feel of the film unfortunately. But the ones that get on screen lifts the action and tension up to whole new highs.The acting are all you could wish for from Cillian Murphy, Brendan Gleeson and Naomie Harris. Their behavior and choices are well founded, and when in panic, you totally forget to 'know better'. Never did I think ""why didn't they do that or this"" or ""how come..."" because the desperation is transferred so well. And heres the exception. The kid actor! How come 9 out of 10 kid actors suck? And how come directors never see it, or do something about it if they do? Megan Burns fortunately has few important scenes, but the ones she has, she sinks with bravura. Everything she says is in a monotone voice and her body language is about as lively as a corpse's. The soldiers roles calls for some depth also. They are stereotyped, somewhat due to their simple dialogue, but also in the role they play in this story. But they do it convincingly enough, and the story will keep you on the edge of your seat.Overall an effective and creepy flick but remember; movies should be seen on the big screen in the darkness. Especially this one benefits from that.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Chilling,"This is not your ordinary zombie film. Instead of being bitten by staggering slow zombies, the ""zombies"" here are infected people who become undead running maniacs who can transform you via oral secretion transmission. This makes the film/franchise novel in itself. The stark apocalyptic vibe of the film is what is ultimately sells it, along with unnerving performances by the likes of Cillian Murphy. There's some sinister characters within the film that masquerade as saviours and some pretty sudden and brutal violence - this film is certainly not for the faint hearted. It's probably one of the most horrific and gory horror films I've seen in a while.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Beautiful Wasteland,"Never being a horror fan, I'm always hesitant on watching that genre of filmmaking. It's not because I don't think they make for good cinema, they certainly do. But in most horror films that I have seen, they don't give me much more than a few scares and jumps. But 28 Days Later is a much different story. It's ability to balance the frightening movements of zombies with the beautiful imagery of a world without people. It's the scenes with simple and quiet shots of wastelands that haunt me more than the zombies themselves.We begin with seeing experiments on apes, because of course humans cant be at fault for the virus. But in reality they are. It was an accidental spread from humans. As creepy as the opening scene was, I didn't find it to be paid off in any way throughout the film. I just felt like that could have been explained in a voice-over or monologue. No matter, we then find our lead character, Jim, played by the brilliant Cillian Murphy. He of course is clueless about the outbreak as he has been in a coma for 28 days. The initial shots of him walking through Cambridge with no one to be seen were both gorgeous and haunting. Much like in I Am Legend, we all wonder, what the hell would we do if we had the whole city to ourselves? Jim comes across Serena and another man who end up saving his life. But we soon learn the details of the virus and how quickly it infects people. After the other guy dies, Jim and Serena are forced to keep moving. The two initially despise one another and don't want anything to do with each other, but as they meet Frank and Hannah, their minds change. In situations like this, it seems as though everyone has a breaking point. As strong as you think you are by yourself, you always need help, and the 4 of them learned that along the way.The joy of the shopping scene was one of the highlights of the movie for me, as it was the only scene where all of our leads were genuinely happy. It's a simple smile that you remember from scenes like this. As chaos unfolds and each character comes into their own, choices had to be made. I think Jim's character arc was great as the more he grew adapt to the situation, the more he acted like the infected. Which by the way, Danny Boyle did a great job at imagining new types of zombies. They move fast and frantically instead of the stupidity of slowly walking. His filming of them was also fascinating. There weren't many moments if at all that he surprised us with their appearance. Often, he would show them first to us, before the characters would see them. In terms of the ending, well I could tell that the directors had different intentions, and hearing about the alternate endings, I think I would have preferred one of those to the one we got. It's a different approach to the horror and jump scare moments. So in all, 28 Days Later is a refreshing take on the horror and zombie genre. It's still not my cup of tea, but I can respect it's greatness.+Cillian's arc+New types of zombies+Boyle's style+Beautiful quiet moments-Opening didn't pay off-Ending felt contrived7.6/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Watch while being chased by rage-infected zombies,"One of, if not, the best zombie movies out there. So damn good; not only does it remake zombies into a new, more mysterious variant of their known concept, but the acting, filming, and everything is incredible. There is really only one problem with the movie. That would be the fact that it can get a bit boring, but not really. Another thing, not just about the movie... one of the best songs of all time (at least, to me) is the theme from this movie. ""In the house, In a Heartbeat"" is seriously probably the craziest yet simple songs ever conceived. With 4 instruments, it sure packs a punch as a theme. Same can be said about the movie; a must watch of any horror fan.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"A different experience (filmic wise,anyway)","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsThose who read the James Herbert novel '48 will be familiar with the concept behind 28 Days Later.What if you and only a handful of other people were the sole survivors of a deadly killer virus and aside from finding enough food,fuel and water to survive,you also had to evade a gang of blood-hungry infected people with a psychological yearning to kill?It's an original,intriguing but ultimately off-puttingly nightmarish idea.Aside from this,28 Days Later is a film that's worth watching if for nothing else,its brilliant visual style.The look of a deserted,ransacked London is just one of the many breath-takingly original and exciting looks to the film.Danny Boyle is truely one of the pioneers in terms of British film-making,and can push us through to the next-level in rivalling Hollywood.****",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
excellent,"Great!In a top secret British lab, peace activists release a monkey infected with a highly powerful and contagious test virus, despite the begging of the scientist in charge of operations. 28 days later, the infection has gone from one monkey to the majority of the UK, the host of the virus is lost in a murderous state, losing all logic and instinct. Jim, a courier, wakes up from his coma in an empty hospital, to find that the streets have been heavily littered and are empty. His fear began when he saw no one. His terror erupted when he realized he wasn't.In 2027, in a chaotic world in which humans can no longer procreate, a former activist agrees to help transport a miraculously pregnant woman to a sanctuary at sea, where her child's birth may help scientists save the future of humankind.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Not bad...,"It should be noted that 28 Days Later is not a horror film, it's a pretty clear cut science fiction film, with some horror elements. The movie starts with a half-witted premise, a bunch of animal rights activists break into a lab and release some monkeys, on which apparently horrible tests are being conducted. What they don't realize, and don't allow one desperate scientist to explain, is that the monkeys are infected with ""Rage,"" which turns out to be an astonishing disease. The minute the first monkey is free, it screams and spits and bites the first person it comes into contact with, causing her to seemingly start to spit out her insides.Sounds pleasing, right? The infections scenes are done really well, it's the implication that this is going to turn into a zombie movie that may cause the eyes to glaze over. But the 28 days in the title refers to when the movie takes place. It seems that a London bicycle courier named Jim (played effectively by Cillian Murphy) has suffered a near fatal traffic accident and woke up in the hospital, 28 days after the accidental release of the rage virus. The London that he finds as he wanders out of the empty hospital is, of course, very different from the one that he left.This is one of those movies that was wisely shot on a different medium than is generally used for modern films. Director Danny Boyle opted to shoot the movie on digital video rather than film, which not only made the film much more affordable (a huge budget, after all, could very well have ruined it), but also gave the movie that gritty, realistic feel that movies like this should have.There are standard rules applied to the infection, such as that if someone becomes infected you have about 20 seconds to kill them before they kill you. Basically, the virus created was meant to be sort of a counteractive drug to combat rage. The ultimate anger management, if you will. But unfortunately, in order to fight rage, the scientists had to create pure rage in their test subjects, the monkeys, and then try to fight it. Unfortunately, rather than reducing pure, unfiltered anger, they turned it into an infectious disease. Oops.Before long, Jim is traveling with Selina, a hardened survivor who has learned to detach all emotional connections with other people in case she suddenly finds herself faced with the decision to die or kill someone close to her in less than 20 seconds. They meet up with a big tender man named Frank and his daughter, holed up in a high-rise apartment building, and ultimately the four of them decide to try to drive in Frank's London taxi cab toward what a mysterious broadcast on the radio claims is a safe zone.Obviously, there's no way of knowing whether the message is reliable or not (and yes, the mysterious broadcast is one of the most routine, redundant plot devices in the movie, which is a big statement, given that post-apocalyptic zombie movies tend to generally be driven by routine, redundant plot devices), but they take the risk. Life in a high rise apartment building may get real old real quick.What follows is probably the dumbest scene in the entire movie, where the car careens effortlessly over a jam of gridlocked cars in a tunnel. The scene is so improbable and so incongruous to the relative realism (so to speak) of the rest of the movie that I can only guess that it's some kind of in joke which only Londoners, and maybe even only London taxi drivers, would know or understand.Then come the plot holes.When Jim first walked out of that hospital, he found London totally deserted. There was NO ONE in the city. You may find yourself overwhelmed by the astonishing sight of London really deserted (they really cleared the streets for those shots), which may lead you to forget that, since no one is around, presumably everyone who was infected is not only dead, but their scattered carcasses have been cleaned up by someone. Once infected, how long can the host expect to live? 20 minutes? A day? A month? Or maybe they just went into hiding like in I Am Legend. Attributing an intolerance of daylight would not be the only zombie or vampire-like quality attributed to those infected with rage in this movie.In the political and military climate into which the movie was released, it makes a strong comment on the possibility and danger of biological warfare, so much so that it may even seem to be cashing in on this fear. But not only does it call our attention to this possibility, even more than it might already have been there, it also forces us to consider what the world would be like after such an attack. I doubt it would be much like it is in the movie, but I also have a feeling that most people imagine what such an attack would look like, rather than what it would look like 28 days later.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
The most misunderstood film of the decade,"This terrific film has turned out to be the most misunderstood film of the decade. Referring to it as a ""zombie horror"" is incorrect in its entirety: the creatures in the film are NOT the undead, but are in fact humans that are infected with a devastating virus that locks them into a permanent state of murderous rage; and while one could be forgiven for calling the film a horror, it is in fact a focus on human drama, as the protagonists struggle to understand and deal with their predicament.Having said that, the film does deliver a few genuinely terrifying moments, and the geysers of gore are frequent enough to keep the horror fans happy. The early scenes are the most memorable, as we see the deserted city of London explored by a formerly comatose Cillian Murphy, ignorant to the devastation that the virus has caused.Stealing the show is actor Naomi Harris, with her brilliant portrayal of Selena, while Danny Boyle's direction and John Murphy's music are close seconds.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

One of the best in the Zombie-genre!,"Over the last couple years, I have watched over 20 zombie-movies.This one is one of the few, i regularly come back to, to have a frightening, yet entertaining time. This movie a piece of art, without having an tremendous budget.The mise-en-image is nothing eccentric, but still has it's moment of good camera movement and pictures. The make-up for the zombie-actors and actresses is quite frightening and in combination with a very good sound, it creates a lot of stressful moments (something i expect in a zombie-movie, where zombies aren't resurrected bodies, but people who have died because of a virus).The last but not least, that i want to mention, is that Cillian Murphy is one hell of an actor. Just amazing! And he fulfills his role as Jim just perfect. The movie has a good building tension and gives something like character development (as much as you can have in a movie of 113 minutes, where it's more about the momentum, than the personal issues and development).Why I didn't rate it a 10/10?Despite all the lonely and sad moments, in combination with the feeling of helplessness in the story, which makes this movie so ""realistic"", at the end, it turns a bit more into an action-movie, than before. The twist from being a calm, yet horrifying movie with some stressful moments to a movie where just action and noise is taking overhand, was just slightly to much for me...Still, I love this movie and so far I haven't seen a zombie movie that could be a match for ""28 Days Later"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

The first great British apocalypse movie,"28 Days Later is the best British horror movie to be released in years, perhaps the best since The Wicker Man.  The scenes of an empty London are truly eerie, and the stark, bleak visuals make it an urban horror to remember.  The infecteds (NOT zombies) are not your typical George Romero monsters, i.e. slow and not much of a threat.  They are quick, savage and angry.  The use of handheld cameras and point of view put you in the centre of the action, adding to the terror.The film is split in two halves thematically and narratively.  The two lead actors a terrific, but in the first half of the film Brendan Gleeson steals the show as the ideal father figure and in part 2 Christopher Eccleston is equally effective as the ruthless army man. The film has many fantastic shots, (empty London, Manchester ablaze), but there is a ten minute almost silent section of the film in which is pure cinematic poetry.  Cillian Murphy's slient, psychotic rage is captured by Boyle perfectly. When he exacts his revenge on his captors the editing, camerawork and soundtrack make it a scene to remember.This film may not set the box office alight or live as long as Evil Dead or The Trilogy of the Dead, but it is better than most teen slasher flicks of the 90's and highly entertaining. It has some humorous moments too, and a shot of an entirely naked man for the ladies. Go see it!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Entertaining for the most part.,"Having seen the sequel first and being disappointed with it, I viewed this movie with low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised and wound up enjoying most of the movie. The hero (actually more like the anti-hero)was an annoying weakling throughout the movie but this is what makes the movie OK. In real life, not everyone is ""Rambo"" and it was refreshing to see the hero more helpless than helpful. As far as zombie movies goes, there's nothing really surprising. There are the usual chase/escape scenes and kill or be killed scenes. The gore is minimal, and left mostly to the imagination (which isn't a bad thing).My main complaint about the movie happens towards the latter portions of the movie where the story takes a left turn into the dregs of humanity. Even so, it doesn't detracted too much from the overall entertainment value of the movie.Watch this one but skip the sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Survival Beyond the Outbreak,"28 Days Later, directed by Danny Boyle, is a groundbreaking and intense zombie horror film that revitalised the genre with its gritty realism, emotional depth, and fast-paced terror. The film follows Jim (Cillian Murphy), a man who wakes up from a coma to find that a virus has ravaged Britain, turning most of the population into violent, infected zombies. As Jim navigates this post-apocalyptic world, he encounters survivors who are also trying to stay alive in the midst of overwhelming horror. With its raw, visceral energy, 28 Days Later set a new standard for the genre and remains one of the most influential and powerful films in the horror canon.Cillian Murphy delivers an excellent performance as Jim, perfectly capturing the confusion, fear, and eventual resolve of a man thrust into an unimaginable world. Murphy's portrayal of a regular person trying to survive in a nightmare is both compelling and emotionally charged. The supporting cast, including Naomie Harris as Selena and Brendan Gleeson as Frank, bring additional depth to the film, making their relationships with Jim feel genuine and grounded. The emotional stakes are high, and the characters' struggles are deeply felt, which adds a layer of humanity to the film that elevates it beyond the typical zombie fare.Danny Boyle's direction is masterful, creating a world that feels both immediate and terrifying. The cinematography, especially the use of wide shots to capture the desolate, abandoned streets of London, amplifies the sense of isolation and despair. The film's pacing is relentless, with moments of quiet tension building toward explosive action sequences. The infected are portrayed as fast and savage, creating an overwhelming sense of urgency and danger. The film's score, composed by John Murphy, is haunting and memorable, perfectly complementing the film's atmosphere of dread and desperation.What sets 28 Days Later apart from other zombie films is its exploration of human nature and survival. While the infected are terrifying, the true horror of the film comes from the choices people make when pushed to their limits. The film examines the morality of survival, the fragility of civilisation, and the lengths to which people will go to protect themselves and their loved ones. It is as much a psychological thriller as it is a horror film, and this depth gives it an emotional weight that is often lacking in typical zombie fare.The film's themes of hope, survival, and the breakdown of society are effectively explored, and its bleak but ultimately hopeful ending resonates deeply. The pacing is spot-on, with moments of intense action balanced by slower, more introspective scenes that allow the film to breathe and enable the audience to connect with the characters. The visual style, coupled with the stark realism, makes 28 Days Later feel like a terrifying possibility rather than just a work of fiction.In conclusion, 28 Days Later is a truly exceptional film that redefined the zombie genre with its gritty realism, emotional depth, and unforgettable tension. Danny Boyle's direction, combined with stellar performances and a powerful narrative, makes this film a must-see for horror fans and anyone interested in a truly gripping, thought-provoking experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Great British Indie Zombie movie,"A pretty great British indie zombie film that stands the tests of time with great filmmaking and script! Aswell as having two stars such as Cillian Murphy and Christopher Eccleston. Cillian is brilliant in the movie though and I love seeing him progress throughout the world and adapting whilst keeping his humanity. The film being indie makes it a proper movie where it's not a zombie movie that goes for over the top action or tons of effects, this film is realistic, gritty and grounded, and it shows off a more empty and sad world in the zombie apocalypse. The film shows people at their lowest moments of survival too and this instance is disturbing even if realistic. It's a great look into the world and the humanity that reigns during it.

Zombie Rennaissance,"Danny Boyle did a good thing here. He brought back the zombie movie. I know, technically Resident Evil came out before 28 Days Later, but that one doesn't count. 28 Days Later showed those tepid Studios that zombies are scary, and that people have an appetite for zombie flicks.Dawn of the Dead got remade, and it gave George Romero a B-12 shot right where he needed it. Now we've got the Diamond Dead to look forward to, and a host of other zombie fare in the near future. Now, I know this isn't your typical zombie flick, it's more about a virus.Same thing though, really. This movie was a gritty, in your face kind of movie and the first half hour is about as tense as anything I've seen.

28 Days Later...,"Despite being warned that a group of monkeys about to be released from a lab by some anti-vivisectionists are laced with disease, they let one of them out anyway and next thing it's a month later and ""Jim"" (Cillian Murphy) wakes up in hospital all by himself. There's not a soul to be seen, anywhere. He can't spend the entire film wandering about naked, so finds some scrubs and goes exploring - gradually gleaning information about the plague that led to the evacuation of the cities and to his current isolation. It's not as if he had anything to do with the release of this virus, but he now has to deal with it's consequences. Luckily he encounters ""Selena"" (Naomie Harris) and ""Mark"" (Noah Huntley) who save him from a marauding mob (think ""Omega Man"" from 1971) and their risky adventures begin trying to find what's left of humanity and hopefully safety. A wind-up radio broadcast gives them some hope, and off they travel with newfound friends ""Frank"" (Brendan Gleeson) and his daughter ""Hannah"" (Megan Burns) in their black taxi (so of course, it takes a circuitous route) to Manchester. Their arrival visits tragedy on the small group but also introduces them to the last bastions of military security - under the command of ""Maj. West"" (Christopher Eccleston). Pretty swiftly they realise that very little of this new scenario is much safer for them and their thoughts turn to leaving...! This is quite an effective apocalyptic tale of corrupted science and morals and uses, for most of the first section of the film, dialogue sparingly allowing the eerie photography and soundtrack of a largely abandoned London to set the scene for us. Thereafter the writing isn't the best, but the benign sense of menace exuded by Eccleston and the confidence of both Harris and the young Burns work well at giving us an almost claustrophobic sense of peril, especially as we drift to a denouement that is cleverly constructed to make us think. It's bleak and threatening at times, not without the odd dark humour and in the end presents us with quite an intriguing look at humanity in many of it's less attractive, more visceral, guises. Danny Boyle and Alex Garland keep a few twists for the tale at the end, too, and Murphy holds it all together in an understatedly potent fashion.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

"effective atmosphere, derivative story","`28 Days Later' could easily be the fourth installment in George Romero's `Living Dead' trilogy  only this time the zombies have a bit more get up and go to them.When Jim wakes up out of a coma one day, he discovers that not only is he the only person in the hospital but virtually the only person left in the entire city of London.  After wandering through the deserted city streets for awhile, he eventually runs into a couple of stalwart survivors who inform him that 28 days earlier a plague began sweeping across the planet  catalyzed by the release of some infected test monkeys  causing people to turn into mindless killing machines and passing on the virus to their victims through their blood.Although `28 Days Later' is little more than a rip-off of those earlier zombie classics, director Danny Boyle does bring a certain level of artistry to his handling of the material, particularly with his apocalyptic visions of a London and an English countryside utterly bereft of human beings. There's a real end-of-the-world eeriness to much of what we see on the screen, a product more of suggestiveness than of blatant visualization. Indeed, Boyle shows the zombies as little as possible, a wise move for a couple of reasons: first, because leaving a threat unspecified allows the audience to use its imagination, thereby heightening the suspense and tension, and, second, because, quite frankly, these fleet-footed zombies simply aren't all that terrifying when we get a close-up view of them (certainly not on a level with Romero's lumbering  and truly horrifying - originals).  And that, perhaps, is the biggest complaint I have against the film.  For all the impressiveness of the visuals and the tone, `28 Days Later' just isn't a very scary film in the long run.  The plotting is derivative, the characters not very well developed, and the poorly staged final showdown more laughable than frightening.  Like two many horror films, this one suffers from a weak third act, with the anticipatory windup more impressive than the delivery.There's a lot to admire and recommend in `28 Days later.'  But it just doesn't get under the skin the way the best horror films do  and the nightmares just don't come.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
One of the Better Zombie Films,"Pros:Performances were good, Cilian Murphy and Naomi Harris were notably well castThe cinematography was brilliantThe thriller aspects were very entertainingOne of the best British films I'd sayCons:I did think Christopher Eccleston as the villain was slightly off, maybe the wrong castingThe writing as well at times was a little simple, didn't maybe match the intensity of the films storyOverall, '28 Days Later' was an entertaining watch. I was very much a fan of the performances particularly by leads Cilian Murphy and Naomi Harris. I'd imagine this may have been one of their first big roles and they were great.

"For the most part, it's a modern classic","It's not quite 28 years later, but it's been 21 years since 28 Days Later. It's also the first time rewatching it in more than a decade for me, and I got to see it as part of a double feature with the sequel screened right after.28 Days Later honestly holds up really well. It taps into something that's now very recognisable as the early 2000s, largely thanks to way it's all shot digitally, replicating the feel of news and amateur footage of the time to make something that feels tangible and surprisingly grounded in reality. It also contains some imagery that I feel reflects certain events of the time. That kind of stuff - tapping into repressed fears surrounding news coverage from the start of the 21st century, which I'm ""lucky"" enough to just remember, as some of my earliest memories (and older generations wonder why younger generations seem so traumatised) - is far scarier than the infected will ever be.But at the same time, props to this movie making zombies kind of close to scary again, largely through making them not technically zombies - more just people with really violent rabies.The style of this works, the survival-focused story is pretty good and well-paced, that opening is iconic, and the characters aren't quite as dumb as most horror movie characters (can't quite say the same about the still enjoyable sequel). 3/4s of the main cast are excellent, but the weak link stuck out like a much more painful sore thumb than I remembered.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Danny Boyle's Terrifying Take on the Zombie Movie,"While technically not a zombie movie (it's an 'infected' movie), 28 Days Later is one of the finest films in its genre. Shot on digital cameras, the film has a very cheap and ugly aesthetic that, at first, can seem off-putting. Yet, you slowly realise that only adds to the film's realism.The movie's greatest achievement is its jaw-dropping portrayal of a post-apocalyptic London. Shot quickly in the early morning hours, which was achievable with multiple digital cameras. This real location footage is more effective than any amount of expensive CGI could ever be. It presents one of the most chilling visions of the apocalypse I've ever seen.What's even more unique about this film is that the low-grade, unattractive visuals are juxtaposed with a well-directed and well-acted movie with a prominent director and stars. While it looks like a straight-to-DVD film, its writing, directing, and acting are much more significant.This movie is also one of the earlier examples of ""fast zombies, and the zombies/infected here are terrifying. Yet the film really works in the third act, when the zombies take a backseat, and we see that when society collapses, humans can be the real monsters.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
More interesting than I thought.,"When I decided to watch this film, I thought it would be just another zombie B movie. However, I think I was wrong. The plot is much better and more interesting.It all starts when a group of animal activists break into a laboratory to free chimpanzees that are used as guinea pigs. It turns out that at least some were infected with a new virus, which spreads through body fluids and was being studied. Sometime after that, Jim wakes up from a 28-day coma caused by a car accident. To his surprise, he did not see a single person and only when reading some abandoned newspapers did he realize that, while he was hospitalized, the entire population was either evacuated or died. There follows a search for someone still alive, and the struggle to survive.This film is set against the backdrop of a Zombie pandemic, but the focus is not on those infected or the panic surrounding the disease and its fight. When the movie starts it has already happened, the city is deserted and it looks like the entire human race has been killed. It is quite intense to see this on the screen and a very positive point. I made an effort not to get caught up in details, if we start to think hard the plot reveals flaws in logic. Things get worse in the final half, with the soldiers behaving like mercenaries, in addition to maintaining an ""fort"" in an unusual way, without any kind of replenishment of ammunition or food ... it's like I say: if we think of ourselves plot details, it falls apart.The best part of the film is to focus on the characters and allow us to create an emotional bond with them as we get to know them better. This is not very common in these films. Cillian Murphy did a good job, very psychological. We can see the internal conflicts that his character lives, particularly when he is faced with death (that of people who are dear to him, that of people who have to kill to stay alive). He was the most anonymous of the actors in the film, but the effort paid off: it opened doors for more ambitious works like ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" and ""Cold Mountain"". Naomi Harris is excellent too, has the presence and inner strength that her character needed. Like Noah Huntley, whom she shades almost completely, she already had a steady TV career. Brendan Gleeson is also a veteran and plays an excellent role here. The worst was the soldiers. It is from there that the film begins to gradually lose itself until reaching a rather weak ending, in the style of Rambo, or something like that. Even so, it is a film that is superior to a lot of American trash that circulates around.Technically, it is a very interesting film. The direction, ensured by Danny Boyle, bets strongly on discrete special effects that accentuate the dramatic tension and suspense without overlapping the work of the actors or the story. I think Boyle realized that this is, in fact, the role of special and sound effects, very much in contrast to what we see in American films, where the use and abuse of effects and CGI sometimes make you forget what goes on in the film.Overall, it is a good film, albeit with flaws.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Stands against time.,"Growing up I liked watching movies and my family was pretty lenient on consuming PG-13 and some R rated films. I was 11 years old in 2003, and I spotted the DVD of 28 DAYS LATER at my aunt's house. I arrogantly ignored my aunt's warning and decided to pop it in. The film has stuck with me since. Never forgot the experience of watching it the for the first time.Being that it's been 20+ years since it's release, we cannot not talk about how 28 DAYS LATER has had a cultural impact within film fans and the genre within. I believe this is the first time anyone has had the bright idea to make ""zombies"" and I use that term lightly because they're not really zombies, run like track stars on steroids. The viral infection of the rage virus is instantaneous which already gets rid of the trope of a character being infected and hiding it from others. Already the stakes are that much higher in a genre film like this because of these two simple changes. Also the red eyes and blood are simple, but an extremely effective visual cue. Very scary.Writer Alex Garland clearly had a brain child when he developed this film with Danny Boyle. Boyle does an exceptional job directing the film. Aside from the horrors of a post-apocalyptic world, I still find myself amused at how there were a lot of subtle, yet sentimental moments of tender and commraoditry between Cillian Murphy's Jim, Naomie Harris's Selena, Brendan Gleeson's Frank and his daughter Hannah played by Megan Burns.Christopher Eccelston also turns in a fine performance as the film's villain Major Henry West. It's not mustache twirling at all, more subtle with conviction.The film is just a great combustion of Garland's writing, Boyle's vision, and the performances of the actors. Also the way the film is shot, it feels so visceral as if you're there within that world. I believe what helps it feel that way is that the film is shot with a DV camera. Chris Gill the editor adds some flare with the editing, speeding up some scenes to add in the ""boo"" factor. Good score by John Murphy too. My only nitpick is that the pacing is slow here and there.At the end of the day 28 DAYS LATER is a multifaceted film that explores survival, the fragility of civilization, the nature of human violence, the consequences of scientific experiments, and the darkness within humanity. It's as much a fast-running, blood vomiting, infected with extreme rage, as it is a character driven drama that explores the true meaning of survival in a world that is completely consumed by rage and violence.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
28 SCARES LATER,"Good fun zombie movie. As always, it doesn't always make perfect sense but good fun nevertheless.

Disturbing,"A man named Mark wakes up in a deserted hospital in London. He wanders outside finding no sign of people at all. It seems a plague (transmitted by blood) has turned most of the population into flesh-eating, fast moving zombies. Mark finds a few more uninfected people and they struggle to survive.I expected a gore fest on the order of ""Night of the Living Dead"" or ""Dawn of the Dead"". That's not what I got. There is some extreme violence (including a little bit at the end that I'm surprised got by with an R rating) but not a lot and it comes in short bursts. This story concentrates on the characters and their moods and actions. And, for once, they act just like you would expect people to act in such a situation. Also attention is paid to such things as electricity, water supply, food etc etc which other movies like this totally ignore. But it is depressing and, at the end, extremely disturbing. This isn't a movie you really enjoy...you just appreciate it for how well it's done. Also it was shot in muted color on video which just adds to the feeling of helplessness. It does have some very scary scenes...these zombies move VERY quickly (they're shot in fast motion), the attack scenes have blood gushing out and there's an extremely eerie sequence inside a tunnel.Also the acting is uniformly good especially by Cillian Murphy (who also has a very lengthy nude scene at the beginning) and Naomie Harris as strong, tough Selena.Like director Danny Boyle's other films (Shallow Grave, Trainspotting, A Life Less Ordinary) I like this with reservations. I'm recommending it but only for those with strong stomaches.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
'The Crazies' meets 'The Omega Man'. Long term horror buffs have seen it all before - and better.,"Let me get one thing off my chest - this is NOT a zombie movie! A zombie is a reanimated corpse. There are no zombies in '28 Days Later...' Much has been made about this movie being a George Romero tribute, and in some ways it is. While there are some parallels with Romero's underrated 'Day Of The Dead' in the latter half of the movie when Christopher Eccleston and co. turn up, it's actually closer to being a remake of 'The Crazies' than his Dead movies. I suppose that more people have seen 'Night Of The Living Dead' and 'Dawn Of The Dead' than 'The Crazies', so that's their main reference point, but believe me, 'The Crazies' is much more accurate. 'The Crazies' with a bit of 'The Omega Man' thrown in. And that to me is the major problem with Danny Boyle's uneven movie - it's just all too familiar. Long term horror buffs have seen it all before - and better. The movie starts off well with a dazed Jim (Cillian Murphy) wandering the streets of an apparently deserted London. These opening sequences are some of the best in the movie and conjure up memories of Vincent Price in 'The Last Man On Earth' and Charlton Heston in 'The Omega Man' (both movies were inspired by Richard Matheson's novel 'I Am Legend'). Soon other characters are introduced and the movie is reasonable enjoyable, albeit a bit predictable and lacking any real depth. Around the half way point I was expecting some new spin, something fresh and original... and it never comes. It's funny but I really expected a lot more from this movie and it failed to deliver, but 'Dog Soldiers', which I expected next to nothing from was much more entertaining in my opinion. So if you're looking for a horror/action movie with fun and thrills check out 'Dog Soldiers', it really delivers.  And if you want to see the ""inspirations"" for '28 Days Later...' rent some Romero, specifically 'The Crazies', or how about Cronenberg's 'Shivers'? Both of those movies are ten times more original and disturbing than this, and probably made on a tenth of the budget.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Poor direction and lighting plagues this great writing,I was really looking forward to this. The beginning is pretty good and the characters are instantly realized. This is far from a bad movie. The story goes an interesting direction and has a clever end that was almost thrilling... But the direction is terrible. There is so much shaky cam and poor lighting it's impossible to tell what's going on. A gun will shoot then the camera will flail and you won't know what happened. The lighting is off. It's often too Bright or too dark. I'm not nitpicking. It was legitimately hard to follow what was happening. If this was shot more like a Romero movie where it focuses on the characters with more subtle action it would have been an amazing movie.,6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
One of the best end-of-mankind movies out there!,"Excellent apocalyptic thriller is a finely made and ever-engrossing film.Young British man awakens from a coma to discover that a virus has cause the destruction of the country and it's every man for himself!Truly well-crafted movie is actually much better than the 'zombie film' label that everyone seems to slap on it. While there are zombies in this motion picture it's really not about them, it's about our little band of surviving human characters. In a sense it's Boyle's version of Romero's classic Dawn of the Dead (1978), which is just one of the many films that 28 Days Later... takes inspiration from, but this movie is just too good to be seen as a rip-off of anything! Writer Alex Garland gives us an intriguing and thrilling tale of human survival and survival of the human spirit. Director Danny Boyle give us plenty of terrific action sequences and a great atmospheric fear as well. The cinematography is stylishly good.The cast is awesome. Rising star Cillian Murphy is truly likable as our sympathetic leading man. Naomie Harris gives a strong performance as a woman fighting to stay alive. Supporting performances from Gleeson, Burns, Eccleston and the rest of the cast are excellent as well. The film boast some splendid, and bloody, special effects.

Boyle's British Take,"Limited within the confines of a 'Zombie' film, Boyle does excellently to add his own input to the standard storyline. As a Zombie film it is rather odd as for the vast majority of the time, there seems to be little in the way of looming danger, and whilst this certainly slows the pace down, it does allow for character development and some arcs which would usually be forgotten. Fortunately everything picks up for a brilliant ending, Murphy truly given the opportunity to show the range within his character. This is when the real action begins, the edge-of-your-seat climax and engrossment into the conclusion for the main characters and those surrounding them.Although it was purposeful choice, the visual quality of the film does leave a lot to be desired, as does the audio. It may provide the 'survivalist' atmosphere but isn't great for the majority of the film. Also can't figure out why Eccleston was given a posher accent, obviously the character doesn't have to be the same as the actor nor be from the location of the film, but they were in Manchester? Unnecessary, but forgivable given the ending.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Fine British horror!,"Coming from England I have been very excited about the recent resurgence in British horror to hit the market. Dog Soldiers' was easily my favourite movie of last year and recently I got the chance to watch Britain's other main horror from 2002  28 Days Later.Some people have been calling this a rip-off of Resident Evil' but those people should know that the script for 28 Days Later' was written before Resident Evil' and therefore any similarities are purely coincidental. That's not to say that '28 Days Later' hasn't taken influences from elsewhere, some of the scenes are reminiscent of horror classics such as Day of the Dead'.At the beginning of the movie we see a group of animal rights activists break into an animal research laboratory to release some monkeys. During the break in a laboratory worker catches them in the act but the activists prevent him from doing anything about the break in. The laboratory worker pleads with the activists to stop and informs them that all the monkeys are infected with `rage'. They don't listen and free a monkey anyway, to their misfortune. 28 days later Jim (Cillian Murphy) awakes from the hospital bed he has been in for the past month or so and realises that something is very wrong, the city of London is completely deserted. After wandering around he discovers `the infected' as well as a few survivors. With only a handful of survivors the days of the human race look numbered, is there any hope for survival?What we have here is a very well written and thought provoking horror movie with some rather deep and meaningful subtexts. The movie is not as straight forward as what it seems at first, there are points made in the movie about society as a whole which require some thought about before they can be fully understood and appreciated. These sentiments are much like those found in Cannibal Holocaust' but not against a morally-corrupt backdrop like CH so therefore they have more meaning and purpose to them.There is some good acting in the film too, particularly from the young Megan Burns who plays her character, Hannah, as if she were an experienced young actress. Hannah invokes feelings of sympathy in the viewer because of all the hell she's been through; after all she's just a child. Her performance is powerful and realistic and should be given the credit it deserves. Cillian Murphy is also good as Jim, though one must question whether the dialogue written for him was realistic; there are certain scenes where it becomes hard to suspend your disbelief. Viewers are also treated to some quality direction from Danny Boyle of 'Trainspotting' fame.Unfortunately I feel that the second part of the film became its downfall. The plot suddenly seemed to shift away from the original subject matter and changed into more of a story about humanity's own self-destructive nature. While I agree that some of the issues tackled in the second half were exciting, intriguing and thought provoking I feel that they should not have made such dramatic changes in the storyline.One thing that works brilliantly for the story though is the virtual lack of character development. Normally I feel that a good movie should include a lot of information about the characters history yet here it doesn't. We know hardly anything about the characters that we are watching. How does that improve the film? Because the virtual destruction of humanity is being portrayed and those people who have survived don't have the time to get to know each other as they must concentrate on what is going on around them. The short bits of character history that are released into the film are all of interest to the viewer and keep the isolated and desperate feel of the film going. By not knowing who these people are we are placing blind trust in their arms. Before the outbreak of the virus they could have been serial killers, burglars, car thieves or some sort of general social scum, all of which is irrelevant now as they must join forces or they are finished. This point is similar in ways to the points made in the original Night of the Living Dead' about joining together to work for a common goal.Less the slight inconsistencies and minor deterioration of the second half we are still left with a very good, thought provoking movie that is definitely worth watching. Fans of the horror genre should enjoy this and also fans of Dog Soldiers' as both movies create a similar atmosphere. My rating for '28 Days Later'  7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
One of the best horror films ever made,"28 Days Later is simply put, a brilliant film. It holds so many idea and thoughts in itself about the post-apocalyptic world, and about human survival and human extinction. It has some really amazing cinematography and direction. Danny Boyle directs the film with passion, with skill, and with will. I think this is very much a director's film. The different settings are very amazing. The writing is great, it allows us into these characters' lives. The film is very scary at what points it is trying to make. It is scarier in a realism way, in a way that only haunts us in our nightmares. The acting is great. Cillian Murphy proves to be a leading man. The film is also very bleak and dark, not just because it is a horror film, but also just in general. It is disturbing in a way that other horror films are not. It is realistic, and very hard to watch at times. Overall though, 28 Days Later is one of the best horror films ever made, simply put. It might just be Danny Boyle's greatest film.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Covid changed this movie for me,"I saw this years ago and liked it, found it to be a fresh take in the zombie genre but now watching it during these pandemic days I find myself living in it was a totally different experience. Thing is before Covid this was just another (albeit good) zombie horror movie, now it hits much closer to home, as I'm watching the daily news reports and crazy events unfold around me, my world getting smaller and smaller with each new restriction the events here felt more plausible or actually able to happen. I wonder if these times will change how I look at all end of days/ disaster movies?Anyways this is from director Danny Boyle, an apocalyptic thriller about a deadly viral outbreak and the resilient Londoners trying to survive in a world of infected, flesh-eating zombies. The (now infamous) opening scenes of our protagonist waking up in the hospital and roaming the empty London streets in his hospital gown trying to figure out WTF is still amazing. Great characters, a good plot, went a bit off the rails for me with the rapey military but up until that point excellent.

Engrossing New Spin on the Zombie Genre,"28 Days Later is a revolutionary film about a virus that is accidentally released in England called Rage. Rage is a virus that turns a human being into a psychotic monster called an Infected. The film focuses on a group of survivors trying to make sense of the epidemic that they are faced with.The cast is top-notch, you have Cillian Murphey (Red Eye, Batman Begins) and Naomi Harris (Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest) and some other people I will fail to mention. The movie is also directed by Academy Award-winner Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire). The movie has strong performances, and some very suspenseful scenes.This is basically a more realistic version of George A. Romero's zombie series. 28 Days Later is heavily inspired by other horror classics, such as Day of the Dead (1985). The movie also has beautiful cinematography and some amazing shots of deserted London. It was filmed in digital video.I have to say that I really enjoyed this movie.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
*1/2 out of 4.,"A group of animal rights activist break into a secret lab late one night and set free a group of monkeys and chimps that are infected with an anger virus.

"Which is the bigger nightmare: raging, flesh-eating zombies or human beings out of control?","When animal activists in London set free a laboratory chimp infected with a deadly virus, they unwittingly unleash a plague that consumes the entire planet.

A Tightrope Between Matheson and Walking Dead,"After waking up from a coma, a man named Jim (Cillian Murphy) discovers that the entire city of London and maybe the world has been taken over by a virus that causes people to go into a rage. Now, he is left with only two things to do: find others like himself and learn to survive.This film can be seen as a tightrope connecting ""I Am Legend"" (any version you want) and ""The Walking Dead"". Like the former, you have one man alone against a world of post-human monsters in an evacuated large city. He is looking for a cure, or at least a way to survive, and he finds a female companion to share the journey. The differences between the films are relatively minor in the context of the overall plot.And then we have the latter. While the ""Walking Dead"" comic or television series could be compared to any zombie apocalypse film, it again features one man alone in a big city (Rick in Atlanta as opposed to Jim in London). Most notably, both start in a hospital. Major West could also be compared to the Governor. This may be a coincidence, or it may be an homage -- according to Robert Kirkman, he had the comic plotted out before he had seen this film.We are given this horrific vision by director Danny Boyle (best known at this point for ""Trainspotting"" before getting even bigger with ""Slumdog Millionaire""), and he does a fine job. By saying this film takes elements from predecessors, it may sound like I am being condescending or trying to sell the film short. I am not. Boyle does a wonderful job of showing a desolate city, a man isolated in London (the last place he would expect to be alone) and people infected with the rage virus. Much of horror cinema is not so much being original (a very, very rare thing these days) but taking a well-trod archetype and making it your own.One brave decision that was made was the casting of no-name actors, or at least no actors that stand out for Americans (this is before the ""Doctor Who"" franchise took off in the States). Any name actor (such as, say, Leonardo DiCaprio as was rumored) would distract from the grand vision, I feel. It shifts the focus from the story of all humanity to the story of one man. Interestingly, Cillian Murphy has since become a huge star in his own right -- watching the film now (2013) is different than when it first came out because of this.The heart of the film is Brendan Gleeson, who plays Frank. It takes it from a horror or survival film to a story of the goodness of humanity. The saying that sometimes the worst brings out the best in people is exemplified in Frank. His good nature and altruism shine and have a positive effect on those around him.Many consider this a ""zombie"" film, while others try to differentiate it from that group (Boyle himself has called it a zombie film). I think there is a distinct difference between a virus that affects the living and the walking dead (even when the walking dead are brought back by a virus). This is, really, just a tale of survival that could have been portrayed similarly as rabies or AIDS. This is another way the film is influential; hundreds of zombie films have come out over the past decade (most of which are terrible), but the rise of the ""infection"" film owes its genesis to ""28 Days Later"".The only real complaint is the suspension of disbelief we have to have about Jim's beginnings. Waking up from a coma that he was in for at least three weeks, he is able to run easily without muscle atrophy or fatigue. He also survived in a hospital where no one else did. And most amazing of all, he seems to have not urinated or defecated in the bed. But all horror and science fiction films require a little bit of magic, so I think we can mark this off as being in that category.The film is heavy on the survival aspects, moderate on the action, moderate on the gore by ""zombie"" standards. And very light on the romance, which I am pleased about (that is one advantage it has over ""Omega Man""). The film is all about trying to make it out alive, and that is something I can see more of -- ""survival horror"". While I would not recommend seeing this until after seeing ""Omega Man"" and ""Last Man on Earth"" just to put it in perspective, this is a very good addition to the line of films coming out with these themes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
It was and still is ok.,"That was my first time revisiting this movie since it came out because it feels like that's the movie that started the whole modern revival of the zombie genre, and 20 years of that made me a bit sick and tired of it. But many consider it a classic so I had to give it a go.My impressions remain the same as when I first watched it: it's good in many places but a bit meh in too many others and this inconsistency makes it just an ok watch. As many have mentioned, the first half is great, and then it progressively becomes messy and it tends to make you lose interest. And in many aspects it does feel like a low budget indie movie, and not in the good crafty way. An interesting watch you can skip if you don't have the time for it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Finally something to make Romero proud!,"Finally a ""zombie"" movie to make George A. Romero proud with the new generation of directors and writers. Between hundreds of zombie movies that popped theaters for the last few years, there're no doubts that 28 Days Later together with Romero's second ""dead"" trilogy produced (and being in production) during this decade are by far the best ones already produced. The most funny thing is that this movie is directed by the most improbable of the directors to direct something for this genre: Danny Boyle. Yes, the Trainspotting one. The interesting thing about him is that he likes to handle with human limits, and this movie couldn't be different.Screenplay is signed by Alex Garland, and it's fantastic because it follows almost the same steps of Romero's movies, where a virus and zombies are just camouflages, trying to explain over metaphors and allegories a reality possible to happen in some near future. The criticism is always there, all the time, disguised as entertainment. It's truly a movie to make Romero proud with those ones that one day were watching his movies and are now being inspired by him.It's also interesting when we finally understand that the budget of a movie isn't responsible for its quality. 28 Days Later cost US$ 8 mil and had a US$48 mil gross, while the shameful Resident Evil trilogy cost US$ 200 mil and its gross hadn't achieved even the double of its total budget. These brutal differences should make producers, directors and studios responsible for trashes like Resident Evil feel ashamed of their selves. With Romero's words ""The best horror films are the ones that are much less endowed"".This movie is a precious gem among horror and sci-fi modern productions and certainly can already be consider a classic for the fact that it's based on classics.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Extremely stylish horror film,"I thought this movie was quite good until about an hour into it. After that it becomes stunning and hypnotic. It's just amazing. This is an unusually good horror movie. I thought it looked boring but then I saw in a interview with the great artist Clive Barker that he thought it was good, so I decided to watch it, and I must say he is right. It's very good. I really liked the characters. The girl is a good actor. The other actors are also very good. It's a zombie movie for the 21st century. It is also a great fantasy movie with very interesting spiritual twists, and not only violence. The scene where he walks around in London reminded me of my own day in London where I was all alone, and only managed to walk a little around the bridges. I went to ""The London Dungeon"" but didn't have time to go in. I guess everyone has dreamt about the same, that is, to see a completely abandoned major city. It's the ""what if...?"" fantasy. 10/10.

It started out well...,"I don't know exactly what stops me from enjoying 28 Days Later, but it just doesn't strike me as being nearly as good as others have made out. Maybe it is the inordinately slow pace. I really don't know. I think part of the problem is that the characters carry about the same level of importance to the average viewer as a badly-articulated marionette. In any case, 28 Days Later could really have been titled 28 Days Long, because it certainly takes its sweet time to get anywhere.The introductory sequence in the research lab was a nice touch, and it started the film off on a great note. We've grown all too used to film scenarios in which some kind of army biological weapon brings about the destruction of the world. 28 Days Later takes the heroic step of placing the blame where it really belongs, in the hands of ignorant activists who care nothing for the consequences of their actions, so long as the world is brought into line with their backwards, retrofit philosophy. The real problem begins after the outbreak, when we're following our rather scruffy hero around the empty city.I don't think it was such a good idea to use music over the top of most every shot, for one thing. Films like C'era una volta il West managed to effectively use near silence in order to induce strong feelings, but it appears that today's directors just don't understand the value of a mood or how effective silence can be when it comes to inducing it. Another significant problem lies in the characters. We see them do terrible, even unforgivable things, but very little in the way of explanation is given. The audio commentary refers to keeping the exposition short and relying on the audience to fill in the gaps. The problem here is that the director and writer do too much of this. They also rely upon the viewer to find excitement or interest where there are none.It was a bold move to not have any Hollywood A-list stars in the film at all, although this was probably more because of a small budget rather than any artistic concern. Cillian Murphy is an excellent protagonist, combining a certain naïvete with a decisiveness you don't normally expect after seeing the character's other qualities. He is a more believable version of the characters that populate films like Resident Evil, to put it bluntly. Indeed, it is caring what happens to this guy next that keeps the audience watching.It is when we meet the soldiers that things start going downhill. Up to this point, regardless of what one might think of the central characters, they all had redeeming qualities that made them seem like human beings rather than pieces in a game of plot chess. The soldiers, on the other hand, have no such qualities. They are as interesting as a bag of hammers, and generally about as intelligent.You will note that I haven't said anything about the fast-moving zombies. I think the writer deserves kudos for getting around that problem by making the story about an outbreak with traceable biological causes, as opposed to the usual mysterious causes for zombie outbreaks. The normally incongruous moments when the zombies are running faster than the living are deftly explained away by this setup, something that would have made the Dawn Of The Dead remake work substantially better if they'd even tried it.All in all, I gave 28 Days Later a six out of ten. It has enough intriguing concepts or foundation to keep the viewer interested for the first viewing, but it doesn't have the legs to keep up a lasting viewing experience. The writer and director sum it up brilliantly when they talk about how they set up a whole heap of rules for their story, then ignored them at will.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"Not a ""zombie"" movie really...","This is a very well made British horror movie. Everything was near-perfect here. The acting was flawless and the effects were excellent. The storyline was good also, however more toward the end it got a little off centered but that does not ruin this movie. Jim (Cillian Murphy) is a very realistic and likable character, one you would root for. Jim is the sole survivor (or so he believes) of what appears to be the apocalypse. He then journeys to find his parents and then a safe place to stay, and meets a few people along the way: Selena (Naomie Harris), a survival-obsessed, leader-like woman who is with him for most of the film, Frank (Brendan Gleeson), a light-hearted, good-humored guy who probably a SWAT member before the epidemic and has holed up in his apartment with his daughter, Hannah (Megan Burns); a shy, quiet girl, Mark (Noah Huntley), a sort-of nervous, side-kick type of guy, and a squad of soldiers at an army base, led by Major Henry West (Christopher Eccleston). This movie cannot be called a ""zombie"" movie really, because the ""infected"" aren't technically dead. However, people will call this film whatever they want. I give this film a 9/10 and hope horror fans will find this movie as good as I did.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"Imagine, what if","you woke up one morning and called for your mom & dad but there was no answer. Already frightened by the silence, your curiosity brought you outside of your house and you saw litter everywhere and doors of cars left opened and haphazardly parked. Something must be wrong somewhere. You walked further and have not heard anything nor seen anyone. All of the sudden your satisfactions quenched when you saw someone 100m away and screamed for him. He came running towards you with bloodthirsty snarl and at that ferocious speed... just before you can swallow your happiness into your belly, it quickly turn into fear as his skin-torn wound with blood-still-dripping face became more visible to realize this was certainly once a man. You run!! You run away from that thing-- that creature-- that zombie! You turn behind and that makes you want to run faster and further as a swarm of those ugly zombies saw what might be their lunch or appetizer.What if you didn't survive 46 days later?

I expected more,"I'll start by telling a bit of the story. There is an awful virus spreading fast throughout the world.As soon as you get in touch with this virus, you transform irreversible into an unscrupulous killing machine... You can't quite call the victims of the virus zombies because they were never buried under the ground,but to make it easier for myself, i'll stick to zombies.The weird thing about ""28 Days Later"" is that the zombies don't move like they just drank 3 bottles of gin like in traditional zombie movies.No, these zombies are fast and very mobile too.And that is something that makes them, in a strange way, less threatening than for example the zombies in ""Night of the Living Dead"". Especially in the first half of the movie, director Danny Boyle is still very good at what he does: the beginning feels like an uppercut and the streets of London are very scary, if it wasn't for the unfitting guitar sounds. But as soon as the main characters leave the big city and arrive at a castle full of horny soldiers, the movie bleeds to death.No more scary images,the actors start acting very poor and this second half of the movie ends in an old fashion and routinely slasher party... George A. Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"" remains the ultimate zombie movie.Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later"" is a very mediocre zombie movie because it just can't scare me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
A zombie classic,"28 Days Later: 8/10This was one innovative movie. Made in England, this documents a sort of post-apocolypse nation after a virus that turns people into virtual savage animals or zombies breaks out. The country is largely evacuated, but one man wakes up in hospital. We then get one of the most ""WOW"" scenes in cinema history, when he walks around an EMPTY London. DEAD silence, the sort you can never really hear. He basically tours the city and it's sights... and then runs into the first zombie. And boy, does the movie get creepy after that. He hooks up with some fellow survivors, and the attempt to not eradicate the virus, but to not catch it, begins. Surreal moment of the movie for me was, from a distance (as they didn't go there), seeing my city of birth and upbringing, Manchester, in flames. The acting isn't really great, but the concept and whole intrigue of the plot really compensates for any shortcomings in that department. Not as much fighting as I expected, but never boring. This is definitely the first true ""zombie"" classic of the 21st century, and worth seeing AT LEAST once.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
10 years later...,"Ten years later and Danny Boyle's lo-fi post apocalyptic horror plays as a mixed bag of success' and failures. Filmed on digital video cameras, the film has a raw quality that compliments the visceral tone stated strongly from the offset. Almost creating a zombie sub-genre of it's own, '28 Days' tips it's cap to George Romero (a shopping scene) and most strikingly, Day Of The Triffids. It's simple stuff, a virus breaks out that's transmitted via blood and saliva which causes it's hosts to become blood curdling zombies on speed. We see the world through the eyes of Jim (Cillian Muprhy) who after having recently woken from a coma, stumbles across an iconic London landscape bereft of human life. If there's a money shot, then this is it. It's a haunting sight that sets the film off with some strikingly memorable imagery. Like any film akin to the zombie genre, what follows is a tale of survival against everything and everyone. 28 Days is at it's best when exploring the world left behind but sadly falls short on character development. Brendan Gleeson's warmth is a welcome and likable addition, but Naomie Harris and Cillian Murphy aren't able to muster much, while Megan Burns playing the teen child of the group is career-endingly awful. What's most disappointing is the third act which starts promisingly but becomes all too formulaic and feels rushed and tacked on. Attempts to develop a love story between Jim and Seline (Harris) fall flat and in the end there is a feeling that style has overpowered substance.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"The Beach, Reloaded","The Boyle and Garland team reload The Beach as a modern day horror movie.  A group of post holocaust survivors discover refuge from marauding zombies with army remenants but their brief respite turns into a nightmare.  In this movie Garland seems to explore similar themes to the beach but the lack of budget really shows.The opening scenes of a deserted London are brilliant but much of the film looks like it was recorded on a domestic camcorder.  The bits with the army look like one of those recruiting adverts.  The lead actor is really annoying, spending a great deal of the movie shouting ""hello?"" like one of the Crankies!Forgetting the fact that primate experiments are banned in the UK. The plot is so full of holes you could drive an army truck through them.  For example, we are told that electricity has failed but when they raid a supermarket (miraculously intact and open) they lighting is obviously working.  We also learn that the world managed to isolate Britain but their radio doesn't pick up any broadcasts from even France.Unfortunately for Boyle it was all done much better by the BBC's Survivors in the 70s.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

One of the best films of the genre,"Not since the original 1978 version of ""Dawn of the Dead"" have I seen such a fine movie for this genre. The cast of lesser-known actors shows that great films don't need star power to succeed. I was completely drawn into the story and unlike most other films didn't find myself guessing when the hero was going to save the day. The plot development doesn't rely on the formulaic buildup of the hero but instead concentrates on the harsh cold realities of such an outbreak. It carries the film and makes it easy to sustain your disbelief as the story unfolds. This is the kind of film, like ""Trainspotting"", also a UK film, that defies the homogenized Hollywood motion picture machine concept. In short, another great film from the UK. I highly recommend it. Also, don't forget to watch the sequel ""28 Weeks later"" which is almost as good and stars Robert Carlyle.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
gripping!,I am kicking myself for not seeing this on the big screen or at least earlier than 2 days ago- I rented the DVD and have watched it twice and will watch it again tonight. I am upset that I didn't see any trailers for this movie- and it was hardly advertised in London when it came out-unless I was just caught up in my busy schedule to notice!Anyway it didn't scare me at all- but I was completely gripped- The emptiness of London felt real and very eerie being a Londoner myself. I identified with Selena's character- suave qui peut- me 100% if I got into that situation. There was gore- but it wasn't overdone like in most films of this genre- there was only one scene in the beginning when I looked away when the 1st infected human vomited blood- it was too much too soon- I hadn't warmed up yet-so to speak.I liked the relationship between Jim and Selena. She was the protector -but they complemented each other- in the end she became more human.,,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

28 Days Later...,"Recently Danny Boyle won the best directing Oscar for Slumdog Millionaire, a worthy award winner in my opinion. Boyle is a director that never rests on his laurels, recreating genres every time he steps up to the plate. One of his most familiar is the polarizing dramedy Trainspotting, but he's also recreated the sci-fi movie with Sunshine, the kids movie with Millions and so on. Danny Boyle is a filmmaker worthy to be listed among the great auteurs like Scorsese, Hitchcock, and so on. With 28 Days Later... (unfortunately, often referred to as a ""zombie"" movie, though it's not) he tackles horror with excellent precision.28 Days Later opens with scenes of violence being watched by a monkey on a TV screen as he lays strapped down in a lab. Extremist animal activists break into the lab in an effort to save the animals from being tested on only to find they've been infected with a highly contagious virus known as Rage. Disaster leads to death and devastation throughout all of London. Cut to Jim (Cillian Murphy) 28 days later, a bike courier waking up from a coma in an empty hospital. After wandering across London, bewildered by the lack of people, he's saved by Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley) as he's being chased by the infected denizens of the city. After finding other survivors, Frank and Hannah (Brendan Gleeson and Megan Burns), they hear a radio broadcast from a military installment which houses other horrors for our survivors.While often considered a zombie movie, and it borrows liberally from many past zombie movies, 28 Days Later is not a zombie movie. The infected in this movie are living beings, infected by a virus that similar to Ebola is communicable by blood, and has more affect on the brain than the physicality of a human being. This is important to the message of the movie as the virus represents something that is inherent in all of us and leads to social unrest and the breakdown of modern society, as the virus did in the movie. In this Boyle has done something that he does very well in every one of his movies: creates a great social commentary. Throughout the course of the movie we see that there are those who would fight against a society gone wrong, and those that would exploit it. Yet, while exploring the themes of moral ambiguity, Boyle never handles them with a heavy handed approach.Having a moral/ social message is important to good horror in this reviewers opinion, but how the movie looks and feels is easily just as important to hold the viewers attention. Boyle chose to shoot the majority of the movie with DV cameras, giving the movie a gritty post apocalyptic type feel while also giving the movie a kind of documentary feel as well. On top of that, the DV camera also allowed for tricks that gives the infected an otherworldly look, making them seem scarier when they're bum rushing their ""prey"". The visuals selected to fill the frame also give you a glimpse at an alien world, a city, or a grocery store that should be buzzing with people, but because of the look of film, it seems even more eerie when you see it emptied of all presence.The acting of course is top notch, as anyone whose seen Brendan Gleeson act would expect, but the movie really belongs to Cillian Murphy who had his break out performance in this movie. As Jim, a man who went down one day in a bustling city, and woke up the next in an empty city, Murphy shows the pain of a man whose lost everything before he even knew what had happened to him. Cillian gives us a man in the middle of a crisis that we truly believe his arc from a pained and scared man just waking up at the end of the world to a man who will fight through all hell to protect those he cares about. Naomie Harris, who also received great acclaim for this movie, portrays a strong woman struggling with her fear and sorrow, but always holding it in, trying to steel herself from pain to come. Also keep your eyes open for Christopher Eccleston, who will become the future Dr. Who a few years after this movie.For as great as the movie is though, I do have my nitpicks. Calling the virus Rage seems a little too on the nose for my tastes, but luckily this isn't mentioned too often throughout. At the beginning there are also glaring plot holes in the scheme of today's society. Why is Jim the only patient to not be evacuated from the hospital? And why did they leave a comatose patient naked in the ICU? Why are there no cars left on the streets of London, or along the highways? A lot of this is due to the budget of the film, and can be explained away, but as there are no answers to be found within the actual narrative of the movie they must be left as plot holes. Luckily, as the only plot holes are mainly to be found at the beginning of the movie they do not detract from the movie as a whole, and will be forgotten by most by the end of the movie.For fans of horror, and movies with a deeper socio-political meaning this is definitely a must watch, but think before you decide to show this to your kids. There is full male nudity, as well as a lot of cursing. But if you're looking for a captivating horror this movie is definitely for you.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Walk like a (romero) zombie,"Well not really, but that's not the point, I was trying to make. I just thought of the song, walk like an Egyptian and considering the pace of the zombies on hand here, I mixed it with that. i hope that was somehow clear enough, for everyone to understand! If not just ask/write me!But back to the movie, that has two obvious Romero nods (the grocery store scene, a ""special"" zombie, which reminds fans of ""Bub"" (""Day of the Dead"") and more or less the complete third act, which also looks like a ""Day of the Dead"" nod).

"Trivial storyline, but well directed and performed","Desolated cities or towns after a cataclysm or mayhem and evil creatures ready to harass - something not new, but Danny Boyle has managed to create a decent thriller arising from them.

However, the intensity is uneven, the 20 minutes or so after Jim's awakening at the hospital are slow, and fights with infected people resemble ordinary zombie movies too much. Nevertheless, there are interesting twists and turns, and change or uncovering of human nature during extreme situations makes you ponder and share the feelings. The characters and realistic, elaborated and ""good"" characters can die too.

Zombies on Speed!,"As much as I love the George A. Romero zombie flicks from Night of the Living Dead (1968) to Dawn of the Dead (1978), Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later..."" is a bloody nightmare of a film and one hell of a ride that I've had the pleasure of experiencing. It's different than most zombie movies because this time around, somebody placed adrenaline on these creatures to make them more scary than before.The film begins after a protest outside of London, England where a bunch of PETA freaks decide to let loose a bunch of caged experiment chimps where they don't know what they've been infected with until one of them catches the disease where all hell starts to begin.28 Days Later after the incident, there's not a single soul walking around the streets or bridges of London. No cars honking or crashing except a lone survivor by the name of Jim (Cillian Murphy in a leading heroic role) gets out of bed to see that he is the only man left on the face of England until he realizes that the apocalypse begins and there are other survivors including Selena (Naomie Harris) and her male friend, Mark (Noah Huntly), they try to see if they could find any weapons they could use to hunt the human creatures down.The way the zombies attack in this film is much more different than having the flesh bitten off, the blood of a zombie has to hit the eye or the inside of your mouth where within a couple of seconds, that person becomes a zombie and has to be killed.After Mark is attacked by zombies and killed by Selena, her and Jim run through the streets of London where they meet up with Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his daughter. The four of them embark on a journey where it plays like Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" with the characters making London their own personal ground stealing stuff before being chased by zombies and fighting off soldiers in a hideaway mansion.""28 Days Later"" is truly a virtuoso in horror cinema where in this decade, Danny Boyle must've taken notes to find out how to make a successful horror picture.It sure as hell worked for me.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Potentially very good movie sunk by plot holes,"OK, the film makers get great marks for some impressive and powerful footage of an abandoned London. The acting was very strong and the film moves at a crisp pace. Overall, the film accomplishes a lot on an obvious shoe string budget.But this script could have used a rewrite or two. The story is too contrived. There are too many implausibilities to ignore. If the author could have made the story more believable this could have been a powerful movie. Perhaps, the budget was too tight to resolve the major plot holes.The whole virus should have been explained a little more. It just seems to be an excuse to introduce 'classic' zombies into the movie. The scenes with the soldiers are just the writer's attempt to make a 'Lord of the Flies' type of statement and should have been omitted as they distract from the terror of the main characters fleeing from Zombie London.The idea of a handful of people surviving a virus that wiped out a city is good. The fact that the survivors are hunted by the virus victims is great. But this movie quickly takes a wrong turn and just ends up as another hack and slash revenge flick.In a nutshell I was disappointed by this movie. It was stylish, clever and well paced and acted, but the story itself is too flawed to be taken seriously.

Totally and Completely Scary,"28 Days Later... a man wakes up in an abandoned hospital to find London completely trashed and deserted without a person in sight. Well, at least not at first. A virus called ""Rage"" was released after a group of people set chimps in a lab free, unaware that the primates had a disease more fatal and horrifying than any other. After one bite, one scratch, one drop of blood, a person is infected and within seconds becomes a deranged, outraged monster that only knows one thing- to attack.Danny Boyle keeps the action and the pacing frightening and totally believable in this British apocalyptic thriller. Cillian Murphy is intriguing as Jim, who befriends Selena, a woman who survived the initial outbreak. Together they find more survivors and must stay alive on their journey to a military base where they can only hope there is anybody alive- that is, without the infection.The zombies are fast and truly scary, with some great gore effects and the movie ties together nicely for a really satisfying climax. One of the best apocalyptic horror films out there, probably THE best... much better than the similarly plotted ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" or the letdown ""Dawn of the Dead"". 28 Days Later is a feast to the eyes and provides some genuine, original scares.*** out of ****",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

High-concept horror has its faults and virtues,"28 DAYS LATER...Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound format: Dolby DigitalSurvivors of a virus which turns infected victims into murderous zombie-like creatures struggle to stay alive amidst the chaos.High-concept horror from TRAINSPOTTING director Danny Boyle and novelist-cum-screenwriter Alex Garland (THE BEACH), produced on a modest budget and filmed with digital video cameras (transferred to 35mm for theatrical exhibition). Cillian Murphy is the hapless hero, compelled to join forces with a motley band of survivors (including Naomie Harris, Brendan Gleeson and Noah Huntley) who run afoul of an Army encampment run by well-meaning - but deluded - military officer Christopher Eccleston, whose rash behavior unleashes a fresh wave of horror. Comparisons with the work of George A. Romero are inevitable, though the film's impact is blunted by rapid editing which curtails the violence and renders some of the action scenes incomprehensible in places. However, Boyle uses edgy visuals to keep the audience off-guard at all times, and the narrative builds to a satisfying conclusion. The opening sequence, in which Murphy stumbles through deserted London streets, is truly haunting.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Pinnacle of Horror,"Director Danny Boyle's creation is one of true genius. He's done what so few horror films have ever done, cementing the characters in the audience's hearts. The movie is not so much a zombie-flick but more of a drama infused with horror while telling a tale of the all-too real fall of man. Cillian Murphy was awesome, along with Naomie Harris and really the whole small cast is just overwhelmingly great. The characters are built up enough to feel a cringe in your heart when their in peril, and yes, this film will nauseate you with it's not just its gore but its horrifying look at humanity. It's not only a survival story, but one that questions mankind's place in this world.Not to mention John Murphy's score is absolutely stunning. It literally gives one chills, encompassing fear, pain and over all savagery. The film's moments of silence are even more unrelenting in their magnificence and quiet terror. It really stands out as a different type of horror that some main stream audiences may not like because it actually has plot, which is turn off to most popcorn movie goers.

Brillaince from Boyle in good horror,"After a group of activists unleash rage infected apes, Britain becomes home to those infected with the virus, wiping out everybody in their way and for a group of survivors, they must do anything to survive.28 days later is a mix of strong intelligent thinking, an artistic approach to direction and an endless spinning narrative that engages viewers right in to the very core of the gritty and energetic film that is Danny Boyle's work of genius.A horror is a horror usually for the appearance of an abnormal being or 'monster' and here we see a human preaching concept of animal rights gone horribly wrong when the 'rage' virus affects people. What the cross brings are humans with blood thirsty traits, an inability to go out in daylight and constant appetite. Many have argued the creatures are zombies but these creations feel more personal and have way too much energy and thirst to be stereotyped as such creatures. The fact that they can affect a person by way of simple touch is scary and whilst this isn't as gripping as it had the potential to be, the physiological effect of these beings is sustained throughout the two hours.Danny Boyle is a genius. The recent Oscar winner (Slumdog Millionaire) is able to maintain the thrill factor whilst also capturing the scenes in an unforgivably picturesque way. The filming of this picture is perhaps the finest ever made in Britain. The M1 had to be closed, the main road near Big Ben was shut and these are just a few examples of effort the team went in and considering these shots are only a couple of minutes long, it goes to show how appreciative and remarkable this film is.The scenery is unbelievable. Who would have though our country could have been so picturesque? Boyle's sweeping landscape shots are to die for and the thrill factor in the chases is to live for, consistent and perhaps one of the finest directed British films.Murphy, Harris, Gleeson and Burns all do themselves justice without being too screamy and abnormal as most protagonists in the genre today.The sequel 28 weeks later though not directed by Boyle maintains that level of sublime scenery and adrenaline soaked excitement with a core desperate and energetic storyline whereas this 2002 hit carries a feeling of drama with the line of characters and their lives in the new world.Whereas there are lapses and the end feels rushed 28 days is exciting and penetrates the mind with some unbelievable direction and location with the writing on top form.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Respectable sci-fi,"I had heard a lot about this film prior to seeing it but I still was not sure what to expect and after viewing it I came away thinking I watched something that was fairly good but certainly not anything I haven't seen before. Story starts out in England where a bunch of activists break into a lab to take pictures of the chimpanzees that are being experimented on and they let one go and it attacks the first person it comes across. Turns out the chimps are infected with a ""Rage"" virus that spreads by bites or contact with blood or saliva. 28 days later a bicycle messenger named Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up in the hospital all alone and starts walking the streets of London finding no one. He discovers in a church a bunch of zombies that start chasing him and he runs into two other survivors named Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley) who help him. One night they are attacked again and Mark is cut. Selena quickly kills him and explains to Jim that you have only 10 to 20 seconds to kill someone after they are infected. Later they spot lights in a building and go to check it out and they find a man named Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his teenage daughter Hannah (Megan Burns). Through a hand crank radio they listen to a radio signal that says all survivors should come to their compound for safety. The four of them pile into Franks cab and head to where the signal stated to go. Along the way Frank becomes infected and is shot by the military men outside of the compound. Inside they meet Major Henry West (Christopher Eccleston) who with his band of men have barricaded themselves into an area for survival. Soon they learn that Selena and Hannah are to be used for breeding purposes to continue the race. The film is directed by Danny Boyle who also helmed ""Train-spotting"" and he again shows a good visual flair in his films no matter how low budget. This film is shot with digital cameras and it gives it a realistic documentary feel that reminded me of some of Steven Soderbergh's films like ""Traffic"". The story is very reminiscent of ""Last Man on Earth"" and its remake ""The Omega Man. In fact, in ""The Omega Man"" Charlton Heston teams up with a black female and that is exactly what happens here. The best performance in this film comes from Harris who shows a strong screen presence and it will be interesting to watch her career develop. She steals every scene she is in and she's a definite up and comer. This film doesn't really offer anything that we have not seen before and I kept waiting for something different to occur but it never happens. There are some questions that never get answered like why don't the zombies just feed on one another? And how long does it take before they die of starvation? This film has nothing new to offer but it is competently made with an effective visual style that enhances the many quiet scenes that take place. Along with the performance of Harris I found this an adequate science fiction film that fans of this genre should definitely check out. Nothing thought provoking, but effective in its own way.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Good horror film!,"28 Days is really a strange movie. Its good though and it has some good acting from its actors including Brendan Gleeson, Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris, and Christopher Eccleston. The film has some good music and fits the film well. Whenever the infected people or zombies attack is really amazing. They come running fast like mad men shown with awesome Gladiator type camera shots. Whenever the killers are on screen get ready for a tasty horror feast! There is one scene in the film near the end that I haven't seen to many of and the other one that comes to mind is in Marked for Death starring Steven Seagal. Speaking of the end, The VHS version has an alternate ending after the end credits. 28 Days is good film and its quite different to watch and isn't too gory but isn't without it either so for horror and zombie fans, I strongly recommend this film!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"OK, but the ""Terrifying Alternate Ending"" is ridiculous","The movie itself was OK - I could do without the artsy photography, etc. Perhaps I was expecting too much after reading some rave reviews on this film. One thing that bothered from the start - if the main character ""Jim"" was either in a coma or on medication for at least 28 days, how is it that he could just get up and waltz out of the hospital and not suffer any ill effects of not using his muscles, not having eaten solid food etc.? And how could the IV bags still have juice in them?",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Danny Boyle injects new energy into Zombies,"Without getting into a debate into what a zombie is, there's a virus that's been released that causes rage. A group of animal activists released chimpanzees in a rage experiment. 28 days later, Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up in a hospital. He finds an abandoned London. Also Brendan Gleeson stars as one of the survivors, and Christopher Eccleston as the military squad leader.The team of director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland has given us an exciting, action packed, and eerily atmosphere horror movie. The abandoned cityscape is extremely well done and shocking. The infected run fast and shot in an energetic manic manner. It's very scary to see them coming at the characters. This is all due to the great camera work and editing. After a couple of near misses following his breakouts Trainspotting and Shallow Grave, Boyle re-establishes himself as one of Britain's best.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Was suprisingly good....,"This has all the markings of a horror flick, but to my suprise it really isn't.  It's a more human story, you could tell immediately that this wasn't made in Hollywood....and that automatically gives it a leg up on most other films.  This movie is straight to the point, and has no problem keeping your attention as you see the characters' journey go deeper and deeper into the apocalyptic circumstances.  How'd they get all those people off the streets for that long??  This was a good movie....a lot better than the advertising/word of mouth would let you believe.  It's not like a slasher flick, it actually has a good story/message.  It's a look into the human psyche when faced with its own survival.  It looks/feels like a 'disaster documentary' of sorts.  Suprisingly good.*** out of **** stars",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
28 Days Later A Good Horror Thriller,"28 Days Later is a good horror thriller that is sure to please any fan of the genre. With a cast of relatively unknown actors at the time (except for Brendan Gleeson) director Danny Boyle effectively brings to life the horrific aftermath of a virus that decimates London turning the infected into smart and cunning zombie like creatures full of rage. For those of you who haven't seen it yet I wont tell you anything else other than that. 28 Days Later is much better than some other ones that have come out recently disguised as horror films. (One Missed Call, Shutter, and The Happening to name a few) The cast of unknowns including Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris, Christopher Eccelston and Megan Burns are good in their roles of characters struggling to survive the horror of a virus that has destroyed their home. Brendan Gleason is great in the small role he does have in the film. He provides some comic relief and his character eventually becomes a father figure to all of them. Gleason may not have a big part in it since (spoiler) his role is cut short abut half way through or so but he does a great job with it. Well done. The make up and effects for the infected were fantastic and it made them look absolutely terrifying up close. The music was also good adding suspense and it seemed to sync well with the tone of the movie. Overall 28 Days Later is an effective horror thriller that was much better than I thought it would be. If you're a fan of these kinds of films than chances are you'll enjoy this one too.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
A Post-Apocalyptic Rollercoaster with a Few Bumps,"""28 Days Later"" is one of those films that has a lot going for it but also leaves me feeling a bit divided. The whole concept of a rage virus spreading across the UK and turning people into vicious, zombie-like creatures is incredibly intense. The idea behind the virus itself is solid and ramps up the tension, making you wonder how quickly society could really fall apart in such a situation. And honestly, the opening scenes, where Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up in an abandoned hospital to find London completely deserted, really set the stage for an atmosphere that's both eerie and gripping.I can't help but love the raw emotion that the characters bring. Jim's journey from confused, almost childlike survivor to someone with a lot more grit is solid, though it feels like his arc could've been a bit deeper. Meanwhile, Selena (Naomie Harris) is a total standout. She's tough and practical, and I enjoyed her dynamic with Jim-she's not afraid to call it like it is, and she has this sort of ""survival first, feelings later"" approach that contrasts really well with his more naive, hopeful nature. There's also Mark (Noah Huntley) and Frank (Brendan Gleeson), who bring a nice balance of warmth to the group, and I couldn't help but feel genuinely invested in their safety, especially given how quickly things go south.The pacing is another thing that keeps me on the fence. The first half is relentless, with every scene building tension, but as the group heads to the military base, things start to drag. I get that the story wants to delve deeper into the human condition and what people are capable of when pushed to the limit, but some of that military subplot feels a little too predictable. It shifts from being a nail-biting horror into a somewhat standard ""humans are the real monsters"" narrative, which, while interesting, didn't quite hit as hard as it could have.The final moments though? I was genuinely moved. It ends on a hopeful note that feels earned, even though the whole film is a whirlwind of chaos and despair. It's the kind of ending that makes you think about the survival of humanity and what really matters after all the destruction. It's a nice, though bittersweet, wrap-up.Overall, ""28 Days Later"" is definitely worth the watch if you're into intense thrillers with a twist of deep human drama. I just wish it could've kept that raw energy throughout the whole film. Definitely a mixed bag, but one that sticks with you.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

great movie,"Tuesday evening, 2nd of March, 2009. I'm sitting behind my desk wondering about what film I would write the review we were supposed to hand in the next day. Last week was bound to be a horrible one because all of my friends were on holidays and I had to stay home ill, so I saw more films than one sees in a lifetime. That made should have made the choice quite difficult to make, but it turned out to be rather the opposite. After a week full of good price-winning films, there was only one that really kept haunting me; 28 Days Later.28 Days Later is a zombie-flick, not my kind of film, but when I saw it was directed by the great Danny Boyle, the 'Trainspotting'-genius, and written by Alex Garland, I knew it had to be different. And it was. The beautiful but grim images of a deserted England have a strange breathtaking and even magical aura that doesn't let you go easily. The characters are really profound and they evolve during the story, and it all feels really natural, as if the actors were really experiencing the loneliness and all the hazards, unlike in many other films in this genre. I don't want to forget the actors who played the infected people, because I once saw a guy go berserk and the resemblances are astonishing. What I also specifically liked were the special effects. They were very convincing and spectacular at the same time, a good mix for a film like this one.I recommend this film to everyone, and I think I'm not the only one who does so seeing the amount of prices and nominations it's got. And if you don't like action, the film really makes you think about our society and it's got fantastically beautiful images. I am a bit sceptically about the sequel though, but I intend to see it as soon as possible nevertheless, and I think you will too once you've seen this film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"The Drmonstereater gives his opinion of Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later""","28 Days Later Review It indeed seems at times we live in the most cynical of ages. We often look upon the human race as a walking, talking, autonomous, machine that is without mercy, compassion, or proactive though. A machine that marches through this world, hurting itself, killing itself, and committing crimes against itself and the entirety of the planet. It is often remarked upon that we are one of the only, if not the only, species on our planet that kills out of pure emotional impulse. ""28 Days Later"" gives us an unrelenting, and somewhat cynical look at the most dangerous of human emotions; rage.""28 Days Later"" opens to a experimental chimp laboratory in Cambridge. We then see angry animal rights activists sneakily break their way into the laboratory. They then find hysterical chimps running back and forth in confined, Plexiglas cages. As they set to freeing the animals an unknowing scientist walks in and catches them in the act. ""No! Please stop."" he pleads ""The chimps are infected!"" ""With what?"" the activists demand ""Pure, rage."" he answers. Dismissing the scientist's warning they set a chimp free, immediately it attacks and infects both the activists and the scientist. The film then cuts to a man laying in a hospital bed, twenty eight days after the initial infection.Jim is the name of the man in the hospital bed. Twenty eight days earlier he had been in a bicycle accident that ironically saved his life. Unwittingly he wonders the streets of a now deserted London shouting hello. There is a very despairing and intense scene in which he enters an abandoned church, it is here that he has his first encounter with what the survivors call ""the infected."" Quickly realizing that these are no normal human beings, Jim runs for his life. It is by shear luck that he comes across some properly prepared survivors. Taking him to their small refuge in the London underground they explain to him the current state of England.""28 Days Later"" makes many a wise choice when it comes to presenting its story. As I stated in my review of ""Zombieland"" it's extremely hard to make even a mildly compelling zombie movie. This is due simply to the fact this genre has been tread over more times than the Hollywood walk of fame. There is barely an original bone in the genre's body but somehow ""28 Days Later"" makes it seem like something completely fresh. For an example, most zombie movies the infection, curse, etc. Takes anywhere between a few days to a few weeks to take full effect. The disease in ""28 Days Later"" however, takes a maximum of twenty seconds to take full effect. This makes for a harsh, brutal, killing of any infected character and no stereotyped hiding that one is infected.The second wise choice it makes is the design of its characters. Instead of having an array of characters pick off as it slowly advances it gives us a small group of four, making each death unwanted, and emotionally wrenching, and I mean that in a good way. In addition to this, some of the characters are very cynical of their situation. Take the female side-protagonist Selena for an example. She is, smart, hard headed, and a realist. She gives no chances for anyone lagging behind and often remarks that ""living is as good as it gets."" However, there is optimistic contrast to her bleak personality.With a hard hitting beginning we expect to film to run downhill as soon as it gets far enough to have a contrived romance between Jim and Selena, and thank goodness ""28 Days Later"" isn't that stupid. Throughout the entire film Selena's relationship with Jim remains positively platonic, less can be said about Jim though. However, he rarely ever manifests his feelings, which is a good thing.If there is a single major criticism I have for Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later"" it would be this. The very ending felt contrived. There is a archetype of optimism being shattered by harsh reality, but the end seems to contradict to whole narrative the film had been so carefully crafting. Disappointed with the natural ending I watched the alternate and found myself a world more satisfied. However, I was still able to remind myself that in the other ending, everyone was happy and fine and therefor it just felt like a bleak ""what if"" instead of a harsh reality.

Why does anybody give a budget for a bad movieflick?,"The film is done pretty well, camera, directing, set, acting, etc. No complain about the handyman-part of it.But what I don't understand is the lack of logic and inspiration in the whole story. And that really - sorry - p***ed me off, cause I felt treated like bloody fool!Few Examples:1. London's a estimated 4.5Mio peoples city. Where are the corpses and all the cars? All evacuated? Vanished away? What? Later in the film people were climbing over mountains of corpses but none to see at the beginning? Uhuhuh...2. There should be no electricity. But obviously there are some windgenerators shown in the movie later on.3. There is a band of soldiers who survived all by themselves. Is that believable, that this one unit has survived, build there fort but there should be no others left to be contacted? No CB, no radio, nothing?4. Why are the infected people just going for the non-infected? The virus claimed to be a virus  of anger, why not kill anything in the way?5. When the whole towns are deserted, why go with knives and baseballclubs? What about some nicy spicy pumpguns from your next police-station, weapondealer or military base?6. Why are the protagnonists WALKING to Jims parents house? No more cars and gasoline there?

Overrated and Underscary (is that a word?),"Started off pretty good. Interesting, eerie, lots of potential. But by half way through, I knew disappointment was in the air. The ""infected"" are barely involved, just showing up occasionally to keep our main characters moving on to the next place. And while the ads boast ""scary as hell,"" I'd have to say it's anything but. Not one moment in this film was truly scary. As for the cast, they did okay. It's always good to see Brendan Gleeson in another role, and Christopher Eccleston, while his character was a bit lacking, did good with what he had to work with as well. The other newcomers weren't bad, but it won't be a breakthrough role for any of them. This seems to be the Blair Witch of this year. People want a good scary movie, and word-of-mouth is pushing this one, but it's mind-boggling to figure out who it is that thinks this is good. Was it a horrible movie? No. But it's nothing I'll ever care to see again. I'll take my clichéd American horror movies over this any day, thank you.As for the ""alternate ending""... What a joke. I mean, actually the alternate one (while not as upbeat, so mainstream America will hate it), is better, because the ending they used takes a giant leap and makes no sense at all.

Running,"As a whole I really enjoyed 28 days later. It's definitely one of the better zombie horror movies out there. Characters are engaging, violence is rampant, zombies are scary and visceral in their movement. Performances are all great. Directing is okay, I dot really see the point of having it shot on a consumer camera and thus aging very poorly. And because it's not a found footage type of movie, it never convinced me of what it's trying to do. You really have to put in a mental note not to get put off by the quality when the movie starts. You get used to it afterwards.Scariness is alright, the expressions of the zombies are done really well and at certain times very creepy, most memorable is the church scene. There are a ton of jump scares though, both visual and through sound effects, the latter was not a great experience, especially because they lowered the rest of the audio to make the jumps extra loud. Resulting in most of the movie being at a semi whisper level unless you want your ears blown out.The ending is a bit harsh and felt rushed to just go through it that quick. It would've been nice for it to have had more time instead of some scenes with the soldiers.Overall a excellent zombie film though, just the fact it was shot in such poor quality means it's going to age worse and worse.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Nice British post-apocalyptic tale,"28 Days Later is a British post-apocalyptic horror/science fiction film that depicts the breakdown of society following the accidental release of a highly contagious virus and focuses upon the struggle of four survivors to cope with the ruination of the life they once knew. Although a critical and commercial success, I only got the chance to watch this today. I was quite surprised with this film. The director Danny Boyle, who is now best known for the multiple Oscar winning film, Slumdog Millionaire, showed a very interesting and unique vision. His post-apocalyptic tale borrows some elements from other films but at the same time its like no other. The first act is definitely the best; a disorientated Jim (Cilian Murpy) wakes up in the hospital only to find out that he's alone. There's not one single person in the hospital or outside. Jim has no idea of what happen or of what's going on and as he wanders in the streets we get to see several shots of a deserted London accompanied by atmospheric instrumental music and it makes for a very cool and effective scene. At some point Jim is rescued by Selena (Naomi Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley).They break it down to Jim, a contagious virus was accidentally released and most of the population is either infected or dead. The infected ( they're basically zombies ) show no sign of human behavior and only care about killing. Later on Mark gets killed and Jim and Selena are joined by Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his daughter Hannah (Megan Burns). The four of them desperately try to stay alive and after hearing a transmission on the radio they decide to go to Manchester where supposedly are a group of survivors. There is some violence and gore, but apart from a scene towards the end, nothing too strong or particularly disgusting. Cilian Murphy is tremendous as the lead character and he's the only actor worth mentioning because the others don't get that much screen time or attention. The film reminds me a lot of The Last Man On Earth, and the third act, which involves some moral dilemmas, reminds me a bit of Blindness but, remember, both this films came after Boyle's film. Overall, 28 Days Later is an original, tense and thrilling film with a very unique vision.7/10",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

"17 Years Later ... Less Scary, But More Disturbing","Sometimes an experience of watching a film outweighs the quality of the film itself. The first time I saw 28 Days Later ... might have been one of those. My wife and my friend Andy saw it at a late night showing in the wonderful Stratford Picture House in the East End of London on a summer's night in 2002, in the first week of its release. A packed cinema was scared to within an inch of itself; Andy cycled home alone through London's by then deserted streets, a journey he still talks about with the hushed tones of one who never quite felt safe the whole journey. The next morning, England played bitter rivals Argentina in the football World Cup in Japan/South Korea; London came to a standstill during the game, during which my wife drove through empty streets to a meeting; streets eerily reminiscent of the film's famous scenes. Since then the film has acquired near-mythic status for me; a film by my favourite director that was so good and so frightening I couldn't revisit it.Until this day in 2019, a whole 17 years later. It's remarkable how much of the film I could remember clearly - it really had imprinted itself on me. The post-prologue scenes of Cillian Murphy's character wondering an empty central London remain astonishing and chilling; and as throughout the film, we are reminded here that Danny Boyle is a director who really knows how to use music. The atmosphere of dread is palpable, a sense that is more long-lasting and all-encompassing than the many effectively executed jump scares. Whilst the low budget is occasionally uncomfortably visible, the skewed camera angles and deliberately disordered shot compositions add to a sense of disorientation and surreality. The film is questioning: what's normal anyway? Who gets to say?Harries and Murphy are both excellent in the central roles; Christopher Eccleston's accent is further disorienting to those familiar with him from other work, throwing us further off centre when the reveal of his group's real agenda finally comes. Whilst the script does creak and strain under expository weight on occasions, the most disturbing moment comes in Eccleston's ""Slow down"" aside to one of his men, the moment it starts to dawn on viewer and protagonist alike how far humanity has fallen in little more than a month, how completely the 'normal' order of things has broken down. These revelations, and the moment when Harries' character watches the wrath executed by Murphy's in the film's closing action sequences (a final act shot through with the tropes of slasher and haunted house movies) point to something else, something we might now term concern about toxic masculinity. In the film's coda, Murphy whispers to Harries, sewing the dress she'd been earlier forced to wear, 'You know, you looked alright in that'; he may not be Infected, but it's possible he carries a similar virus. There are strong suggestions throughout that the Infected look for revenge on the living, but there's enough suggested in sub-text throughout the film to leave us wondering who the really dangerous ones are.The legacy of this film is significant. It consolidated Murphy and Harries as significant actors in their own right; it turned out to be at the forefront a rebooting of the zombie story to the forefront of popular culture, a wive we're still riding today; most importantly, it relaunched the stellar and varied career of Danny Boyle which was threatening to disappoint after the misfires of The Beach and A Life Less Ordinary. For that, I'm thankful - Danny Boyle's films have rarely failed to speak to me and change me. 17 years on from first viewing, this film did again; less scary, perhaps, but more disturbing and relevant to today's gender discourse than perhaps many of us realised.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Dear God what a pointless movie!,"I just got back from seeing this movie with my brother. I never post on these forums but just cannot believe people are praising this movie. I can care less that it is British, that is irrelevant. What is relevant is the fact that this movie made no sense, had a terrible plot and was completely pointless and boring. Here are the reasons I think it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.1. Why did the infected overlook a defenseless coma patient, seems like easy prey to me?2. Why did the infected only come out at night? They were not the undead or zombies? They seemed quite mindless and enraged. At points they were seen in the daylight so obviously it was not a sensitivity to light.3. What did the infected eat? It seems all they did was attack you and vomit blood on you which would cause infection, they never showed them eating people. So, what at all did they eat. That makes no sense whatsoever.4. Also, shouldn't there have .been hordes of infected canines and felines and rats and whatever else running around. Unless the virus could only infect humans and chimps, but they never explained any of that. But since Jim made a comment about the horses being infected one would assume that other species could be, then again Jim wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed.5. Out of the millions of people in the London metro area I can't believe there wouldn't be many more survivors. How could Frank fend off thousands of infected terrorizing the city. If he was able to do it then thousands of others should have been able to as well. And not too smart Frank advertising with blinking lights to the infected exactly where you lived, he must like fighting infected.6. Why would they choose and old crummy car to flee in when there were plenty of brand new mercedes parked everywhere. I won't even comment on the tunnel scene because it was obvioulsy so contrived. I think they could have risked driving a few hundred more feet to change the tire, come on!7. Hey let's have a picnic and sleep in the great outdoors when infected were roaming the land, maybe it would have been a better idea to take shifts driving and sleeping and timing gas stops during the morning hours.I could go on and on about how terrible this movie was but I already wasted my time seeing it.

This movie is amazing.,"Wow, I don't even know what to say. It's definitely a very well-done European film, and I think one of the best zombie movies ever made, I watched this movie many y ears ago, and it's just incredible. This movie has a really special place inside my heart, a quarter of my heart is made out of zombie films, and this one takes most of the space in it. I also think the atmosphere is very well done, it's really original and I like the concept of running zombies and the fact that they are still conscious.

clearly influenced later projects of the genre,"28 Days Later (2002) This is an outbreak film that portrays the breakdown of society following the accidental release of a highly contagious virus and focuses upon the struggle of four survivors to cope with the destruction of the life they once experienced. This is a British film with a relatively unknown cast for those of us stateside. I'm fond of two of the actors, Cillian Murphy, and Brendan Gleeson. Murphy is the lead in Peaky Blinders on Netflix and Gleeson is the lead on the more recent Stephen King adaptation, Mr. Mercedes, on the Audience Network. This was well received by critics and audiences. It's a decent attempt to merge the fear of a horror movie and the drama of a thriller.

Just like the characters in the flick, you're constantly wondering what's happening and when anything will happen.Suffice it to say, nothing ever happens.  This flick is a total disgrace to the filmmakers, who thought an intelligent horror movie meant extended scenes of tedious silence, backed by lightweight Euro beats.

What makes this movie different from the other zombie movies out there? Well, there's a sense of humanism in here, which you would rarely find in horror movies. The movie has such great characters to care and cheer for. I just love it.Another thing that I liked about this movie is that the action scenes used in here helps us understand about human nature in such a state of crisis. I also love the unpredictable-ness in the film. You won't know what happen and who dies when, which is also rare in a horror film. Everything else in here is a ride.The performances by Cillian Murphy and Naomie Harris are great. The movie is also different in a way because it's never always depressing. It's never always sad.

Doesn't age well - even in the short term!,"With much to like admittedly, I think the IMDb rating here is an absurdly generous one. You want to tell me this is as good as PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK???Regrettably the entire film spirals downwards from the opening ten minutes. Jim's awakening in a London hospital to a deserted London is lifted directly from THE DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS (They actually achieved an empty and windswept city, NOT by computerised FX but by filming at 6.30 am and having several streets closed off one after the other.) From here the film lurches into I AM LEGEND / OMEGA MAN territory with mild mannered bicycle courier Jim becoming progressively less mild mannered.By the film's end, JIM is fully RAMBOesque taking out trained combat soldiers. This is total bulls---! A weak-as-p*ss ending does nothing for the film either, including the alternate ending...with the ""chicken!""Some of the best moments of the film are when the four survivors are being chased by the ""infected"" through darkened streets and buildings in very much THIRD MAN lensed sequences.Two things grate on me. NO infection could cause ravenous zombified behavior in seconds and to the best of my knowledge, Britain has more than sixty million registered private vehicles.

Standard zombie fare,"28 Days Later is a zombie film that really doesn't have much of anything remarkable about it. It's certainly not terrific, but it's certainly not awful either. It's just kind of there. The film has a fascinating premise, some startling visuals and a few moments of mild terror. But it never really rises above the mundane, there's nothing that makes it truly stand out from the pack.28 Days Later follows Jim, played by Cillian Murphy, who awakes from a 28-day coma to find London completely deserted. The shots of the deserted city, with the perfect music to match, are haunting, probably the most memorable thing about the film. Jim will soon find the city is in fact not completely deserted as he comes upon a pack of zombies with murderous intentions. Rescued by a young man and woman, Jim will learn that all of London, indeed it seems all of Britain and possibly the world, has been infected with a rage virus that turns them into these murderous creatures. We soon meet a father and a daughter who have also managed to survive. The father is played by Brendan Gleeson, the most recognizable face in a film featuring mainly unknowns.The small band of survivors eventually make their way to Manchester where the film gets somewhat bogged down. It's almost as if the zombies become forgotten and we acquire some new villains who are all too human, all too normal and all too dull. Eventually things begin to move towards what is ultimately a rather unsatisfying conclusion. The film has some great visuals, some fine performances, including that of relative unknown Naomie Harris as Selena, one of Jim's companions on his journey, and a great story to tell. But what started with a great premise and the promise of some genuine thrills in the end falls rather flat. 28 Days Later goes out not with a bang but with a whimper.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

"Good, But not Scary","I have to be honest, i expected this movie to be crap.  As i see it, most horror movies are.  i must say, however, i thought 28 DAYS LATER was actually a pretty interesting film.  It had a message worth thinking about, and there is enough symbolism in it for JD Salinger to of wrote it.  But i don't understand why they pitched it so heavily as a horror movie.  I kept hearing that same quote ""Scary as Hell.""  but watching it, i didn't find it scary at all.  It was gory and violent at times, but i'd hardly describe it as scary.  Suspense was also a key factor missing from this movie if it was a horror film.  Everytime something bad is going to happen you can see it coming, there is always a warning.  More obviously though, you can see when something isn't coming, the music and mood is way to nice for anything bad to happen.  Which reminds me, there are certain scenes in this movies that you will swear were taken straight from a car commercial.  Note, at the end of the movie, be sure to notice a certain inserted shot, it may get you thinking.  Overall i'd say this movie is worth seeing, and entertaining, but you have to be able to want to think about it, and don't expect a horror flick.  *** of **** stars.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
The First Half Is Amazing,"Like most good, but not great movies, the writer had a wonderful and unique idea for a movie.

The way this movie is shot gives you chills from the first scene.  The action is terrific, the direction was superb and the dialogue was natural.  The violence, in terms of a supernatural movie, was necessary and realistic.  Then.....The second half of this movie loses it's way and loses it big time.  The point is good, the idea was decent, the execution was terrible.  The point is this ... is existing really living.  The answer is no, and the movie shows us that.  Question: do we really need to learn that?  Short answer is no.  If done well it could have been good, but done like this it is slightly ridiculous.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"Not a horror film, but very good","I don't see this as a horror film. That they marketed it as one meant I never paid to see it, paid to rent it, or considered buying it. Only that I use a public library to watch films I'd never bother seeing otherwise led me to this film, and I felt cheated by the PR department for making me miss it originally. This is not a zombie film for teens. This is a grown-up film that explores an interesting idea or set of ideas.In addition to being intellectually engaging, in addition to keeping me worried about the fate of our protagonists, the film was just gorgeous. There are easily two dozen shots that could be paintings in the world's great museums. I was blown away by this and did not anticipate it, so it was one of those truly pleasant surprises (the opposite of what I usually get from films, where people tell me how wonderful a film is and then I say ""ehhh, not awful."" Those pushing the film itself made me think, ""this is going to be junk,"" and it was far from that.I have to wonder what they were thinking. I suppose since teens spend most money on films, marketing it in a way that attracts that spendy audience would guarantee some minimal gross. But here I am, a real lover of artistically done films about serious subjects, an educated adult over 50, and this movie was really for me. Because of the marketing, I would have never known this were it not for the accident of the library being out of anything I thought I wished to see. Admittedly, I'm no expert on film marketing, but it seemed to me they missed their real audience.Also, Brendan Gleeson is in it, and I like him so much, I could probably watch him make out a grocery list for fifteen minutes on film. He does much more, of course, but his presence added to the experience for me.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Not Your Average 'Zombie' Flick...,"Danny Boyle is a true gem: a director who gives you no idea what he's going to come up with next. Crossing over with an eerie ease from Hitchcockian thriller (SHALLOW GRAVE) to a funny, gritty, nauseatingly disturbing drama about addiction (TRAINSPOTTING), when I heard that he might be doing a 'horror' film, I couldn't wait to see the result. Actually, with the exception of the startling trailer for the movie, which gave surprisingly little away, I thought I was all ready to tackle Boyle's version of zombie culture.As it turns out, I wasn't.I don't remember the last time I gasped and cringed that much at a movie, much less jumped out of my seat, (which I did several times - something that happens VERY rarely these days.) Much in the way that he less channeled Hitchcock in SHALLOW GRAVE than redefined that director's paradigm of what a suspense thriller is, 28 DAYS LATER doesn't really ape the work of George Romero or Lucio Fulci. Rather it re-energizes the genre by giving us something that, technically speaking, really isn't a ""zombie"" film more than it is a 'plague' movie. Relocate Stephen King's THE STAND in present-day London, and re-populate it with British characters and you're almost close to the feel of what it is.Written by Alex Garland (author of Boyle's ambitiously flawed THE BEACH), LATER'S opening takes its cues from both the Romero and Roger Corman playbooks. Three wrongheaded militant animal activists break into a science lab with the intention of freeing the animals there from the barbarity of medical experimentation. What they don't realize is that they're not only too late, but they are about to loose something upon the world that was never meant to get out...And then, 28 DAYS LATER -A young patient in hospital named Jim (Cillian Murphy in his first major role) awakens in his hospital bed to find himself alone. Not just in his room, but in the hospital, in the surrounding neighborhood, in the city...maybe even in the country. THE WORLD, perhaps. You are as disoriented, startled and scared as he is, and concerned FOR him as Boyle allows you to practically walk in his shoes for a bit and wonder what you would do in his place.Jim goes looking for other people. And he does find them, as they also find him. But the first ones he sees moving about aren't really people anymore...To say more is to spoil the industrial-strength effect this movie will have on your nerves if you haven't seen it before. All you need to know is that there are two kinds of people in this terrifying new world: the infected and the uninfected. And the line between the two groups is as fragile as a drop of blood...It adds to the sense of heightened realism that the cast (much like famed horror classics like NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD) is comprised almost entirely of unknown actors. Murphy was only a few years away from RED EYE and BATMAN BEGINS, and Naomie Harris's breakout role in the ""PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN"" sequel was still in the not-too-distant future. Only HARRY POTTER'S Brendan Gleason is sort of recognizable, and robust as ever as a survivor trying to protect his daughter from the ravages of what has become Hell on Earth.Zombie film or not, whatever you want to classify it as, 28 DAYS LATER is definitely not for the squeamish. Fast, frightening and ferocious, there are scenes of brutality that are not gratuitous by any means, but they're strategically placed at parts of the story when you will least expect them, and they have all the more impact as you come to learn about Jim and his new ""friends"", and you start to give a damn about what happens to them.True, as noted in other reviews, the movie does start to lose steam around the middle of Act Three, and the controversial ending may leave some of you feeling unsatisfied. (Don't forget to review the alternative endings on the comprehensive DVD.)But this is still worth more than just a passing glance. It might very well qualify as a present- day classic. And though Boyle has drifted away from horror again for the moment, I can't wait to see what he cooks up when he returns to it...",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Zombie's are smarter than People:  Film at Eleven,"This movie proves over and over again, that people are doomed not because they're evil, but because they are cretins.The movie starts with the creation of a zombie threat that leaves small handfuls of people trying to find their way to safety.Instead of putting the characters in the sort of jeopardy inherent to the situation, they behave with the sort of reckless abandon that you'd hardly see in normal London let alone a zombie zone.Time and again a character chooses to wander off on their own, not because the plot demands it, but because the body count demands it.A sort of artsy strobe effect is used during violent scenes that at first highlights the horror, and eventually annoys the eyes.If you want to see a movie that avoids most of the above pitfalls, see George Romero's, ""Dawn of the Dead"".  Give this a pass!",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Not quite sure about this film,"To be very frank, I really don't think this is such a phenomenal movie after all.The film takes off well, however it loses its direction in the middle, and completely messes up in the end! This is exactly what happens when one has a great plot in hand and does a sloppy execution of it.However, the actors are definitely the saving grace for the movie. Great performance from him as always. And Boyle definitely knows how to direct.Agreed that the movie has a chilling storyline, but there are far too many flaws and mistakes around. In fact even a single watch is sufficient to spot some of them! And the worst part of it is after making such a great start to the movie, the director just seems to lose it all thereafter. He fumbles with the ending and what you get is a really irritating termination of what could have been one of the best science-fiction movies ever.As soon as the gang reach the weird military quarters, the film ends.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Unveiling Post-Apocalyptic Terror: A Genre-defining Journey,"In the post-apocalyptic world of ""28 Days Later"", silence screams louder than any shout. In a landscape devastated by a genetically modified rage virus pandemic, humanity is a shadow of its former self. It's in this world that we'll follow Jim's journey for survival.""28 Days Later"" was a milestone in the horror genre for introducing a new approach to the infected. In most movies, the infected are slow-moving, flesh-eating undead. Here, the infected are agile and aggressive, an innovative concept at the time, making them an imminent threat. After infection, people remain alive but lose all control and free will, overtaken by rage. The disease is highly contagious, where just a drop of blood entering the body can spread it. Another common trope in infected movies is someone hiding their infection. In this film, that trope is also subverted, as from the moment of infection, the person only has 10 seconds until they become a regular infected.The film's standout, in my opinion, is its atmosphere. Despite the excellent soundtrack, the moments that truly stand out are those of absolute silence. My favorite scene in the movie is one of the early scenes, where our protagonist wakes up from a coma and starts wandering through the empty streets of London, conveying a sense of melancholy and loneliness to the viewer. This film was also a pioneer in being shot entirely in digital format, a technology that wasn't considered advanced enough for a Hollywood production at the time. Although this technology allowed for a more agile and versatile production, being the only reason they could shoot the empty streets of London, the video quality was compromised. However, this choice was intentional (the director wanted to have the ""grain"" effect in the video, and artificially adding it to normal footage wouldn't have been the same), so even the loss of video quality contributes to the film's atmosphere, conveying a rougher and more intimate aesthetic that aligns well with the suspenseful and terrifying mood.Cillian Murphy delivered an excellent performance. The movie delves into human nature and the collapse of society, exploring themes of loneliness, mistrust, and the boundaries of morality in desperate situations. It's a story centered around characters and their relationships, with a special focus on the dynamic between Jim and Selena.The film, well, it's not flawless. There are a few slip-ups in continuity and some scenes that feel predictable. Also, characters make decisions that don't quite add up at times. The last act sort of takes away from the tension built earlier, but that's when the main social commentary kicks in, even if certain parts of that scene might seem a bit improbable.I believe that for genre fans, this movie is a ""must-watch,"" while for those who aren't enthusiasts of the genre, it still stands as a good film to appreciate.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"It's life Jim, but not as we know it.","The first film alphabetically on Disney Plus that I hadn't already reviewed is ""28 Days Later"". Danny Boyle's 2002 reinvention of the Zombie Movie for the 21st century. I've not seen it in quite a while and was interested to see it again, both from a story and from a technical standpoint.Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up in hospital following a coma. He discovers that the ward, the hospital and implausibly London itself seem to have been abandoned. Jim has missed the initial infection and widespread dissemination of a virus, one which turns the host into a rage fuelled indiscriminate killer. As Jim eventually comes into contact with the murderous horde he's saved by Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley) but not all remaining uninfected people have the same charitable nature.It's hard not to start with how the film looks now. Digital film making is certainly all the rage (pun intended) but to go back now and watch a digital film, but none one in high definition is a strange proposition. Initially it looks a bit like when a streaming service starts a show in lower fidelity whilst it tries to catch up. You do, of course, get used to it and it's not long before it's not a factor. You also get the iconic scenes pretty early; the un-natural image of Jim crossing Westminster Bridge and that area being entirely abandoned.Despite the originality (at the time) of the fast running frantic zombies, rather than the shambling type the film actually settles into a relatively standard zombie story from there. The Risk vs Reward of stopping for provisions, the odd moments of freedom and, In particularly, the Humans are always the worst aspect. It's particularly brutal though, particularly in the pronounced action scenes that conclude the film.""28 Days Later"" is one of those films that has been emulated and ripped off so much since it's release, it's hard to remember the initial impact that the film had - and how new and ground-breaking it was at the time.

Good genre movie that could have been better,"It's interesting to see how popular a movie can get despite being derivative to the extreme. I guess this simply means that not enough people have yet seen George Romero's zombie trilogy, or classic British apocalypse TV such as Day Of The Triffids or the mid-70s ""The Survivors"". Making a good genre movie doesn't simply mean patching together all the familiar elements of the genre; you have to add a new twist or a new aesthetic to it. I can't say that ""28 Days Later"" does any of this.The first 1/3rd of the movie is excellent, gaining strength from the predictable yet very spooky images of a London completely empty from people. Cillian Murphy immediately wins the viewers sympathy, and carries the whole movie in a way that the director & writer should be quite grateful for. Unfortunately I think there is a slackening of pace and narrative grip in the middle third, which is the encounter and northbound car journey with another couple of survivors. The two female roles aren't properly developed, and I personally think the actors can't match Murphy & Gleeson... it really does feel like an old TV series here, briefly.The last third is very uneven; it covers familiar territory while making some interesting points; the direction is alternately confused and inspired, and there is a definite weakening from insufficient exposition of the soldiers as group and individuals. A lot is asked from the viewer here, and it seemed sloppy and B-movie like, compared to the first third.Basically, the movie tries to combine two powerful (yet familiar) themes into one, and a proper balance is not achieved. A different editing of the storyline would probably have improved things, but ultimately it is a case of a well-known and thus predictable story, whose first hour or so still works well thanks to atmosphere and acting, which cannot maintain its strength until the end.

My friends couldn't speak for 10 minutes...,"No, that's really a story my friends told me. And then my friend brought me out to see this movie over seeing T3. Was I glad I did so? You bet I was.28 Days Later has nothing to do with Resident Evil. In fact, the comparisons are obvious but 28 Days Later was made for a better reason, 28 Days Later is like a collection of all of the Zombie films you've ever seen made in a fresh and interesting way.Unlike Resident Evil, the powering force of Danny Boyle who brought us Trainspotting is behind this one. Oddly enough, people compare this film to Resident Evil endlessly but the film starts out where 12 Monkeys would leave it off. I find it funny that no one has made that comparison.So, essentially what 28 Days Later is, is what Resident Evil 2 will be, but in London. People who dislike this movie will really SHlT a brick when RE2 comes out and it's.... uht oh... semi-based off a video game where the city is dead! OH NO! But these are just people who tend to complain, don't let them throw you off.Making a horror movie is very hard but this movie pushes all the right buttons and even the buttons Resident Evil didn't get to push. You see Resident Evil was made to appease to video game fans as well as fans of horror films. This movie was made to appease fans of cinema as well as the horror sub genre of Zombie Film (even though it's also a Sci-Fi sub genre, but we won't get into that.)The camera in this film captures moments in time and makes the sure moments of horror beautiful. Everything I wanted to happen... happened. The music fits perfectly with the film, the film converys lights in a beautiful way and all the while the city being empty seems horrifying even if we're not british. It all fits together at the right moment.Of course all the while you have to keep in mind our civilization is not too far away from 28 Days Later. I mean, how impossible is it for one of the American Testing labs in Boston on the MIT campus to accidentally release an animal onto Boston and cause a widespread disease that would have to be quarantined from the rest of the America, and the world? Surely not far off. Anything's possible.This movie truly blew me away. I've been waiting for this movie to come out for a while and it was worth every second of my wait and more. I feel in a way it was a foreign film because Danny Boyle shot it in British fashion which made every second of it even more beautiful.I truly believe anyone who disliked this movie is a person who feels the need to be negative as a critic or simply does not have interest in cinema as an art. 28 Days later is truly a beautiful movie, it is Art-Cinema in an apocalyptic way. Resident Evil is a great American action film and 28 Days Later is an amazing and beautiful art-cinema film from Danny Boyle, our favorite British director. Both are in the same genre, and both are very good films for their genre.I like how they connect and I think Danny did it purposely. To dislike this film is to have no taste in cinema. I'm sure the same people who hate 28 Days Later also hate Run Lola Run and would somehow find a way to hate Battle Royale and every other amazing foreign film. See this film, don't listen to your stoner friends who disliked it. But even that may be a misstatement, because I'm not even sure how a stoner could dislike this movie.

A Masterpiece of the Zombie Sub-Genre,"'28 Days Later' is a refreshing and original British zombie horror flick that not only revitalized the genre but gave it a major resurgence and bringing it back to the mainstream thanks to its compelling narrative, shocking violence, unnerving tension, and a bleak atmosphere that gives an eerily realistic portrayal of a post-apocalyptic world. Even now after more than 20 years this movie still manages to be influential.The Plot = A group of animal rights activists break into a medical research laboratory to free the captured monkeys, despite warnings from a scientist that they have a highly contagious virus and soon enough the virus spreads throughout the country and infecting the population. Then 28 days later a lone survivor named Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up from a coma and finds everything completely deserted.This movie manages to be something new, original, and incredibly scary that's filled with standout moments, memorable sequences and a fantastic cast that really sells the fear of the dire situation they are in. The direction by Danny Boyle is outstanding whose unique approach gives the movie a grimy and nihilistic aesthetic to the production and it totally works as even at its most peaceful moments you're kept on the edge of your seat by not knowing what's lurking around the next corner and creating a psychological dissonance filled with graphic imagery and raw savagery. The movie's slow burn works wonders as it manages to keep the tension and suspense throughout its runtime as everything builds to a satisfying climax.The performances here are fantastic with the standouts being Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris, and Christopher Eccleston who each deliver fine performances that helps fill out this strange and bleak world.Overall '28 Days Later' is a horror masterpiece and one of the greatest zombie flicks of all-time and really give the sub-genre a much needed shot in the arm.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

"One of the best, but beware, the video quality is horrendous","One of the best zombie movies ever made with many of the genre's ""firsts:""1. The first that begins with an actual explanation of what created the zombie plague.2. The first to introduce a fast-moving ""infected"" horde, ratching up the tension significantly.3. The first to infect people instantly (within seconds).It also has one of the best movie scores, one that rivals those from John Carpenter classics ""Halloween"" and ""The Thing."" It is striking how the music can elevate a movie or a scene.The biggest issue, which to be fair, is not something Danny Boyle and his crew could have foreseen, is that it was shot in low quality SD, making it nearly unwatchable on large screen modern HD or 4K TV's.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Scattered,"There are so many films that are like this one. The problem with many is the rules being played by. For me it was how the virus was spread, once the zombies were roaming around. In such a short period of time, how did so much knowledge come forward? And the guy who ran the military compound. How did he put together such an operation in that short time frame? There is lots of action but the chances of the good guys pulling all this off seem quite unlikely. They all end up together and manipulate the horrors, getting them to play off one another. I went into a state of detachment and let the thing cook.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Unique,"A slightly campy rendition of the typical zombie film. The thing that sets this cult classic apart from other zombie films is its quick transition between fight/flight horror and every day concerns. Humor works its way into the script at key moments to let the viewer know all is safe for the time being. Just when you think all is safe, a dream or noise will bring back the fear and expectations of horror. While many non-brits will think the movie boring or disjointed, I think this type of film making has a bright future. No longer are film makers forced to keep the suspense or horror up for the entire length of the film, but the transitions back and forth are problematic because of the lag time the view experiences. Is this really a horror moment or something else? It takes some mastery to get that right for the majority of the viewers, and I think this film does an excellent job of that with its portrayal of the fast moving more animal like zombie. Another unique feature is the transition from human to zombie. At ten to thirty seconds, it leaves little time for decision making and adds to the immediacy of the situations.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Dire British hype,"Day of the Triffids turns into Dawn of the Dead. The only thing scary is that so many like this badly acted and ludicrous movie. Seeing London's streets completely clear of cars, people and bodies was creepy but it hardly fitted into the storyline to become another gaping plot hole, which the film has many of. The public are just expected to be blinded by the light show and it doesn't attempt to explain these holes even in the most incredible way. I probably would have forgotten this 28 minutes later if not for the fact I wasted my time and money watching it. Dire plot, dire direction, dire cinematography, dire acting, this should have just been released on British TV to screen late Friday night for the drunk brigade...",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Badly thought out ideas ruin this movie,"A number of problems spoiled this movie for me so much so that I really struggle to watch it any more.The story is very derivative and that in itself isn't a problem but there are a number of ill conceived ideas within the story that really annoy me.Firstly, any government research laboratory that was engineering a biological weapon such as rage would have far more security than one technician. So, the whole idea of three animal rights activists breaking in and freeing the Chimps was ludicrous. I know that nothing else was shown and it is possible that there was more security but this should have been more than implied  a simple way of getting around this would been to have had an accident happening with one of the scientists  have one of them get bitten which would have made far more sense but would also have been a bit more poetic.Another major problem with the movie was the speed at which the virus infected its victims  you get bitten and within seconds you are an unreasoning creature who only exists to infect others. So, how would that kind of pattern spread much further than the South of England let alone the rest of Europe and possibly the world? I mean the infected didn't seem to have any real sense of purpose apart from their rage so if an infected person was bitten at an airport then they wouldn't have boarded a plane and even if they had then they would have infected the entire plane  including the pilots eventually and the plane would have crashed. Same with any for of transport  the virus would not have spread too far at all. Of course  this could have been solved in my opinion by establishing that the individuality of people's metabolisms meant that some people were infected in seconds  with some it took hours. This would have meant that the virus could have spread and it would have also created a lot more tension in certain scenes.There were other things  the male character who initially saved Jim told a story about how he survived a mass attack of the infected in Waterloo station (or whatever station it was) and how he survived by climbing onto a kiosk stand. So, did this mean that once the infected had infected everyone at ground level then they would have seen him seven feet off the ground and decided that he was too high up?London was deserted, which made for some eerily beautiful and evocative shots  but surely there should have been hundreds of bodies lying about the place? Not everyone would have survived the attacks and there would have been no-one to have disposed of the bodies.The roads to Manchester were deserted  again, there should have been cars everywhere. In fact at one point a character says that under normal circumstances it would take around six hours to get to Manchester but in this case who knows? Well, judging by the emptiness of the roads then it would have taken about three hours. At no point until they arrived at the roadblock were there any signs that the country had been infected by a super plague. No other roadblocks, no military vehicles burnt out or abandoned  hardly any infected  the list goes on.This film which has some nice ideas and beautiful shots seems to fumble absolutely everything that it does. Cliché is heaped upon cliché and ultimately doesn't make an awful lot of sense. The finale with Jim becoming Martin Sheens character from 'Apocalypse Now' makes no sense  a bike courier who has, after all, been in a coma for a month suddenly becomes fit and capable enough to take out some trained soldiers? Again, this could have been solved by having the house at the end being occupied by other survivors  maybe with one soldier in charge. The whole, clichéd, idea that the military would have gone insane in a month was tired and slightly insulting.It's a shame because I love post apocalyptic thrillers but this one was let down by some poorly thought out ideas.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
The horror of the beach is wiped from memory! A Great Film,"This film has one of those ""long awaited"" tags to it.and it actually pays off.Danny Boyle and Alex Garland have taken a good idea and turned it into a great one. Not a horror film but a film of horrors. Without taking the credibility away from 28 days, it is Red Dwarf on earth or Outbreak in england. But also so much more. This is a film that plays with your mind long after you go home as its the chance that it could happen.It manages to make you jump, scared, laugh, and feel for the characters. as they find themselves in a infected country with a virus all around them.But the best thing to do when you go see this film is not to learn any more about it and read the reviews afterwards! hope this is what you are doing! inventive camera work and a great idea make this worth the visit to the cinemaDid it make you jump too?",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
A mish-mash of a rehash but still enjoyable,"Not a horror film  - I don't recall being on the edge of my seat once. The backdrop to the story (the vanilla sky empty streets, resident evil zombies, insecure research facility) has all been done before.The first half had a more interesting premise, and the second half just descended in to a cross between military anarchy and (any) zombie flick. Presumably even military personnel can restrain from exercising their loins for at least a couple of months?An excellent ""British"" movie, but not without problems.

28 Days Later ... Review,"Danny Boyle's '28 Days Later' is a gripping and visceral exploration of a post-apocalyptic world brought to its knees by a deadly virus. With a hint of relevance due to recent events (cough cough). The film's intense atmosphere is fueled by its raw, documentary-style cinematography and a hauntingly evocative score. Cillian Murphy delivers a standout performance as Jim, a man awakening to a nightmare. The film balances horror and emotional resonance, creating a chilling narrative that goes beyond typical zombie tropes. Boyle's direction, coupled with the film's social commentary, elevates '28 Days Later' into a thought-provoking and relentless thriller, leaving a lasting impact on the genre. However, some questionable acting from supporting characters result in a level par score.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Slow deadly nights and long crazy days.,"This horrific metaphor for human disaster that is 28 Days Later works very well. Based on a story of Human despair and relentless hope for a new Birth of Man.Starting with a vision of Mans descendant, while strapped to a laboratory table, continuously forced fed to watch television clips of mass riots, murder, anger and hatred. His easily corruptible mind melting into mayhem and madness. Transcending Mayhem into Madness, Madness into Hate and Hate into Rage, rage that has not only infected the mind but goes further into the Heart and Soul of the Lifeline that flows through the veins itself.Mans ancestor is set lose, set lose by a group of unsuspecting Animal Rights Activists, thinking that they are doing right over wrong.One is bitten. All are doomed.Filmed in the deserted streets of a modern London, this apocalyptic human catastrophe is seen through the eyes of the seemingly sole survivor, Jim.Awaking from a coma 28 days (later) after the unwittingly failed rescue attempt of the infected simian, Jim soon bumps into the head strong and gutsy Selena. Who in turn find two struggling family members, father and young teen daughter, Frank and Hannah.The story continues as a struggle for survival, not only with a land of Soulless and rage-full Humans, but with the very people who they seek help from, a group of abandoned Army Soldiers. The courageous fours perpetual struggle is soon realised, and that hope and companionship is never abandoned, whatever the cost.This powerful warning to us all is never far from the truth, here we see a brainwashed Chimpanzee, forced to watch death and destruction. Turning its newly formed mind into a physical weapon, but what is this irony?Is not the Human Race a by-product of the manipulative mind of a raging simian?Is it not the simian watching Humans raging across the World?Is it not the Raging Humans, which are seen in the television footage, in the end, an influence on this fragile mind?The irony is that the rage was and always has been here, the watching simian was never the catalyst, he was an unwilling victim. We, as a responsible? Race have always brought it on our selves, we are the catalyst of our own destruction.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Will suck you in until the very end,"Boyle masterfully creates characters that the viewers care about, only adding to the tension created by powerful acting and quick jump cuts. By deliberately avoiding cliches and cheap scares this movie stands out in the crowded
zombie apocalypse genre. This movie is not without flaws, and contains multiple continuity errors, despite this the film delivers a well rounded and most importantly, scary experience. Overall I would absolutely recommend this movie",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"Bloody, Great Film","While the idea of zombies run amok in London seems like the premise of the film, there is a lot more here. I can't help but wonder if folks who didn't really like this film are actually reacting to their own mistaken expectations.Actually, the film invites us to think about the horror of violence in human nature: if the ""zombies"" are not terrifying enough simply as zombies (and they are pretty disturbing), the idea that we are already among the enraged zombies is perhaps more disturbing.The film follows Jim (Cillian Murphy) around London, as he awakes from a coma to find the city deserted. He encounters two other waifs, Selina and Mark, and from them learns that a virus has unleashed the normally suppressed hatred in humanity. The whole city has killed itself. In saving herself from the infected, Selina has become hardened and anti-social, but encountering a father and daughter makes her realize that surviving at all costs may not the best option.The high point of this film for me is Christopher Eccleston as Major West, who supposedly rescues Jim, Selina, and Hannah but has ulterior motives. His cool, calm exploitation of these people reminds us that while civilization may hide our basic aggression, civilized people may be just as cruel as the bestial infecteds.The film recalls scenes of horror in Sarajevo, in Poland, in Phenom Phen and in colonial America: a really moving (and terrifying) film that is hard to watch at times and very very hard to forget.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
It hasn't aged all that well.,"I watched this supposedly in HD recently after not seeing it for over a decade. My memories of it were immensely positive, I remember being gripped, engaged and happily going along with whatever the narrative offered.My most recent viewing however was not so straightforward. Being British I am acutely aware of the tropes of UK produced cinema and those cliches don't engage me now, or more to the point I am perhaps more aware of them. 28 Days Later seems prosaic and fettered by these production values and that spoiled my watching experience. On the positive side, there are still iconic moments, an amazing soundtrack and frenetic scenes to be enjoyed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Horror movies the way they used to be...,"When most people think of horror movies they immediately think of pointless nudity, gallons of blood and tons of gore; and while that image may be close to reality, the horror genre offers the chance of delivering something else, something intelligent, something deep. Of course, not every director/writer takes that chance, but when they do, it is big. Director Danny Boyle adds a bit of blood to his effective formula of existentialist character studies in ""28 Days Later..."", a powerful ans smart apocalyptic horror movie in the old style of ""Last Man on Earth"" or Romero's ""Dead"" trilogy.One morning a young British man named Jim awakes from a coma and finds nobody around. He doesn't know it but 28 days before a lethal virus codenamed ""Rage"" was unleashed by accident leading to thousands of deaths and the evacuation of London and other major cities. Now Jim, along with a handful of other survivors must find a safe place and a way to find other survivors of the epidemic before being killed by the hundreds of still living infected people.""28 Days Later..."" is a horror film the way the genre used to be, it is not only an entertaining and scary movie, it is a through-provoking one. Written by Alex Garland, the film offers a surprisingly realist and very insightful take on humanity and survival, as well as providing an interesting social commentary on the easy corruption of the authority. Sure, it may not be the most original movie in the world, but the execution of the whole idea is near perfect. Director Danny Boyle builds up his story at the right pace and lets the story unfold smoothly.The realistic visuals used in the film gives the movie a semi-documentary look that gives the film a frightening realism. As usual, Boyle's focus is in the characters rather than in the plot and this approach is just what makes this horror movie so different than other examples of modern horror. He makes us know, like and eventually care for this characters in a very reminiscent way to what George Romero did in ""Night of the Living Dead"" and its sequels. This is no coincidence as Danny Boyle doesn't hide his influences; the film pays true tribute to well-known classics of the genre without being derivative or pretentious.Cillian Murphy is simply superb as the lead character, but credit must also go to Naomi Harris, Brendan Gleeson and Megan Burns, who play the other survivors Jim finds. Naomie Harris gives a terrific performance as a woman who will do whatever is necessary to survive, and Gleeson and Burns are very effective and their father-daughter relationship is very believable. Murphy has earned praise for his performance but it is safe to say that without this good supporting cast the movie wouldn't be the same.If a flaw was to be found in ""28 Days Later..."" it would be that probably the film may not everyone's cup of tea. Fans of horror will be really pleased but the casual movie goer may be turned off by the grim depressing tone of the film and its ruthless violence. Other than that the film is near perfect and while not the most original horror film, it is one of the best executed examples of the so-called ""zombie sub-genre"".With its well-rounded characters, its witty plot and its remarkable visual style, this modern horror film proves that it deserves all the hype surrounding it. While only time will prove if the film becomes a classic or not, it is definitely one of the best horror movies of the decade. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"Not a sequel to Bullock's ""28 Days"".","""28 Day Later"" tells of a trio of people who survive a raging plague which turns infected people into blood-thirsty maniacs who in turn infect others, etc. The problem confronting our group in this post apocalyptic type sci-fi/horror hybrid is: How do we stay alive, discover other survivors, and perpetuate the human race. On the upside, the flick is well done in a smart and gritty style, only has one dream sequence, and doesn't throw cheap shots at you. On the downside, it asks more questions than it answers, neglects the human story in deference to logistics and action, and is lacking big budget Hollywoodish extras. An okay watch for those into this kind of flick. (B-)",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Fast Zombies,"28 Days Later: Saw it again in the cinema last night, showing as part of Danny Boyle season, I thought it was going to be a 4K remaster but it was the old stock ir a DVD.

An unimpressed chimp ears the face off an activist and she rapidly becomes infected. Cut to Cillian Murphy awaking from a coma in a deserted hospital ... 28 Days Later.

I'd forgotten so much of the detail of the film., Brendan Gleeson with his tank like black cab, reminded a bit of Ernest Borgnine in Escape From New Yi=ork. The trip north through a devastated countryside, Manchester in flames. The crazed soldiers.

Boyle's Zombies,"Danny Boyle won the Oscar for Slumdog Millionaire in 2008.

The man in charge warns them that the chimps are infected with a virus named rage; oh my, do they listen; of course not. Naturally a woman is bitten by one of the primates, l and she, in turn, chomps her fellow activists, which spreads the bug immediately.Twenty eight days later, the virus has reached outside of the lab and into London, which becomes a vast wasteland. Paris and New York also report of outbreaks. Unlike other zombie flicks, the bitten turn rabid in twenty seconds and must be killed quickly.The survivors must travel to find food and water and hear of sex slaves being recruited to repopulate the country.

The Enemy Within,"Synopsis: 28 days after a bicycle accident, Jim wakes up in a hospital. Only to later realize that humanity is almost extinct thanks to a deadly virus.Alex Garland, writer of this movie and others like Annihilation or Ex Machina, does a great job as always by creating a more realistic and planned version than other conventional ""zombie"" films. And the recommendation is thanks to the originality of the script, since when you see it and remembering the current situation, you don't feel so detached from reality.As it is usual to see in dangerous situations, and as in other post-apocalyptic movies, humanity's greatest danger is itself, people stop trusting, attack and lose their minds. It has been seen many times, but as this film is an ancestor of many, it is not a repetition.The direction can be suffocating on many occasions, not as current as other films released in that year that are still relevant, and you can see the low budget in that regard, but the history, as well as the performances are so well worked that they make it impressive in several scenes. By impressive I mean situations that are very difficult to see, heartbreaking in the sense that living that would make anyone's throat lump.Unlike other films of the type, among the protagonists there are no characters that are annoying to the audience. It is very entertaining to see them and I highlight the Brendan Gleeson character ""Frank"" which broke my heart.There are 10 seasons of The Walking Dead and it is impossible how it continues to be justified, unlike this movie, and although both are in fiction, you can notice a great difference between what is closer to reality than to fiction.In conclusion 28 days later, it is a film that has an original vision of a pandemic, and life after death for the entire world. With characters and events that feel real, and remind us that in such danger, our greatest enemy is us.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Very unique experience,"This was a very different movie. Kinda slow in my opinion. Thought it would be better, since it's a zombie-horror film and I love zombie and horror films and everything I heard made it seem like it was amazing. Wasn't bad though. The way the movie was shot and filmed was great. Had an amateurish feel like a found footage movie. Also made the movie very realistic. Some good zombie action and lots of mild gore. Nothing that even remotely shocked or pleased me besides the eye gouge at the end(that was only a very brief ugh reaction though) but enough to really satisfy the non horror and gorehounds. The movie also had a good story. Not just the same basic thing you see in most zombie movies. Solid acting and likeable characters. Very intense throughout. Seen many zombie movies and that was the first time I've said that about one, because zombies aren't scary in my opinion. This movie was though. The whole opening 10-15 minutes where the main character Jim is just walking around London were really haunting and creepy. Interesting ending.

The DVD: The alternate endings were better,"This movie kept me interested all the way up to the part were the soldiers came in. After that it takes a nose dive into confusion.

Why would the soldiers need to round up women to survive?? Wouldn't they want to get out of the country like the rest of the people?Anyways, The alternate ending that is on the DVD is much better than the one in the theatrical release.

Few weaknesses and key strengths,"The zombie genre has been beaten to death yet 28 Days Later stands out for being something more. The story's unique strength is its narrow scope. It follows just a few characters in mostly quiet, scavenging situations. This reserved use of zombies gives their appearances more impact while allowing time for character building. Meanwhile, the thematic focus on human evils creates a more relatable message about normalized violence. This solid narrative is enhanced by a strong cast, most of whom bring dynamic performances (particularly Naomie Harris, Brendan Gleeson and Cillian Murphy).However, the filmmaking is the true highlight of 28 Days Later. Danny Boyle is one of the better directors of his generation and this film exemplifies that. Use of Dutch angles, image composition, shadows, and gritty film quality all contribute to artistic cinematography and a distinct mood. Additionally, the editing is explosive because it builds tension with well-timed intercutting and strikes a stylish tone with a sequence of smash cuts towards the end. Overall, 28 Days Later is a film with few weakness and key strengths that boost it to a superior level.Writing: 8/10

Also good because it shows us many locations, all taken from real world, which additionally motivates us to watch. Bit emotional.

The last 15/20 minutes  was just the usual 'let's fire some guns, blow stuff up and kill people' to get to the end. The story before that made up for it though.I was reminded just a bit of George R.

super speed zombies equals super scary,"Despite a very corny premise of how the infection begins, the movie is good at the scare and the gore.

These super strong creatures intensify the nightmare factor. The movie also is supported by good acting on the part of Cilian Murphy and cast, as well as limited idle chatter (a problem for many horror movies).

Failed Potential,"With the exception of the opening 10 minutes, 28 Days Later fails completely. The scenes of the Jim (Cillian Murphy) walking around an abandoned, completely deserted London are creepy and un-nerving. The scenes that hint at mystery and unknown danger are far more intriguing than the rest of the movie. As soon as Jim hooks up with other survivors the scares are lost. Danny Boyle stupidly telegraphs every jump to the point of disqualification. When the survivors leave London and are 'rescued' by a bunch of thuggish army louts it degenerates into extremely cruddy sub-straight-to-video nonsense. I've never seen a film lose its way so badly as this. What could have been really exciting and scary ends up being too cheap and confused.There are hardly any 'zombies' in this movie. Any action or thrills are over within seconds and the complete lack of logical thinking (even within the morally bankrupt army) becomes annoying.It did appreciate the raw-looking photography, it gave the movie a realistic edge but it's soon ruined as the plot meanders and doesn't know what to do. Cillian Murphy was quite good as the hero but the woman playing Selena was too brutish and hostile to be sympathetic. I did like Brendan Gleeson's character but he wasn't in it long enough.Mainly, 28 Days Later suffers badly from minimal plotting, awkward characters, a distinct lack of scares and a corny ending that's out of sync with everything that preceded it. Danny Boyle should NOT attempt horror again.The DVD is in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound. Extras include a commentary, documentary and deleted scenes. The cut scenes (and alternate ending) are worthless and not interesting.For a superior and more exciting zombie movie wait for the new Dawn of the Dead to hit DVD. In the meantime, rent this one.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

One of the movies that may have upstarted Cillian Murphy and Naomie Harris acting careers,"(2002) 28 Days Later
SCIENCE-FICTION HORROR SUSPENSE THRILLERIt has Jim (Cillian Murphy) waking up and attempting to find survivors as anyone can be able to turn into an infected ghoul/ zombie by a simple infection or saliva since there's no vaccination. And they are not the same zombies as some of the other movies as they act like ghouls for instead of walking they are rushing toward their targets. Jim eventually meet Selina (Naomie Harris) and Hannah (Megan Burns). They eventually stop at a small army camp of survivors led by Major Henry West (Christopher Eccleston) who have different intentions what they want to do.One of the better and exciting zombie movies as the genre has been done to death. It was this movie that solidified Cillian Murphy as a serious actor and gave actress Naomie Harris a role in the James Bond franchise.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
This movie could use more zombies,"I guess every time I watch zombie-movie I'm hopping to see something like George A. Romero's Day of the Dead. 28 Days Later... is pretty different zombie-movie. I realised what is good about it only at the ending. It looks like home-made movie but that looks pretty creepy to me. The plot have some similarities with Day of the Dead and the beginning is very similar with Resident Evil's ending, but still there are some originality in it. The movie is well directed. The atmosphere is calm and some how chilling. The main thing what this movie is missing is zombies. There were some zombie scenes but only a little and when you're watching this film it doesn't seems like you are watching a zombie-movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Timely horror,"Every summer, the news media pounds a story or series of stories into the ground until that season is known for it. Consider a couple of summers ago, which was the summer of shark attacks. Or the recent summer of child abductions. In reality, there were not more shark attacks or child abductions in their respective summers, but the media grabbed a couple of high profile cases and built trends around them (road and air rage media circuses also apply here, very fittingly). 2003 will probably remembered as the summer of SARS and monkeypox, which makes it the perfect summer in which to see `28 Days Later'. As the story opens, Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes from a coma in a locked London hospital room and finds it deserted, the key to his room shoved under the door. In a series of amazing shots, he wanders by Big Ben and through Piccadilly Circus and finds no one. He does find walls plastered with missing persons photos that immediately bring 9/11 to mind (although the film was made before then). He finally finds three people who bring him up to date: a vicious virus was accidentally unleashed by animal rights activists freeing specimens from an Army facility. The virus is blood borne, and if you're infected, you will be dead in twenty seconds. Those infected are overcome with rage, attack those around them, and vomit infected blood everywhere. Get this blood in an orifice or wound, and you've got twenty seconds yourself. In twenty-eight days, England has been wiped out. This sounds like one of Romero's living dead movies (but since the writer wrote the book and movie `The Beach' and the director, Danny Boyle, is responsible for `Trainspotting', there is no doubt an anti-drug subtext here) with one major difference: these zombies are fast. They move like lightening, although they do nothing more than infect the living, not devour them. This virus is not a smart one; without sustenance, the world will be quickly wiped out, and the virus with it. The first third of the movie, the discovery phase, plays like `Night of the Living Dead'. The second third, wherein four survivors search for others, plays like `Dawn of the Dead' (including a deliberate homage, a shopping trip). The end finds them in a military base, like the one in `Day of the Dead', right down to the zombie tied up for experimental purposes. But Boyle did not make a mere horror movie here. This is social commentary with a pulse, fast and furious, and it will put you on the edge of your seat. It's shot in grainy digital video for a documentary feel, and the camera struggles to keep up with the action when it occurs. You think you see more than you do: the savage flashes of marauding monsters will make you shrink away from the screen, but the gore is minimal. Boyle overreaches somewhat; horror fans will no doubt jones for more outright scares, and the audience that would love dissecting the film will be put off by the graphic violence and tone. The cast is game, with Naomie Harris strong as the seemingly tough chick and Brendan Gleeson sympathetic as a concerned but gruff father. Everyone digs deep and seems real enough to make you care, a rare trait in a horror movie, even an arty one. It will come as no surprise to anyone who has ever seen a movie that the military folks are up tp no good (although I would have never guessed their sinister plot), so as the film rachets up the tension, building towards the climax, it actually loses creativity. The shocks here are among the best in the film, but we can feel it running out of speed. Watch the scene with the rats in the pitch black tunnel; that is the kind of nail-biter the last part of the film should have delivered. And the actual finale seems a little too upbeat for such a dark vision; it jars with everything that has come before it. Boyle has said that the movie is about Jim's search for a father figure, but that message is obscured by the seeming prescience of current events the film achieves. Strap in and read into `28 Days Later' whatever you wish to; there's enough here for everyone.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Classic,I know it's not a true zombie film but the take on zombies in this film is one of the best of all time. And that score by John Murphy- WOW,9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Alright!!!,Alright movie. Neither here nor there really. I would have to say though that it kept the excitement throughout the movie very well. I thought the acting was pretty good and they used my horror movie philosophy and didn't bring in any big stars. I thought that Jim could've been a bit more shocked when he had just got out of hospital at the start. It seemed as if he knew what was going on or something. The directing of the movie seemed poor from my point of view. At times it was hard to tell what was happening from the camera angles. Another thing that had me thinking was that when the infected people caught on fire they were fine and could still chase the uninfected but when they were shot a few times they went down. Also the ending was butchered. They could have done so much with that kind of a story for a twist at the end.,7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Spend your time somewhere else,"Can compete for one of the most hyped movies failing to live to 10% of its expectations.Agreed that this is a Sci-fi movie, but so many logical errors is unacceptable.1) How can everyone in the city and in the hospital are dead and he is the only one alive. Even if he had been in coma, he won't be the only guy in coma in the hospital.2)Why does Hanna and her dad have the lights glowing up in their apt? will it not attract the blood-thirsty infected ppl. By having the lights on, they are giving them an open invitation.3)In Hanna apt, Jim shaves his face. Come on guys, when it is life and death situation do you think about shaving? In the next scene, Frank tells them that its difficult to get water. so why Shave.4)The main character Jim's acting was very very bad. As if he is a sponsor for a phone company, his first dialog for 5 minutes is just one word ""HELLO"". He says that at the cheese burger place and also in his dreams. Why does he keep saying HELLO all the time? 5) Why does Jim tries to find cheeseburger in the derelict eatery which probably has infected ppl in them. what is he going to achieve by going in? 6)Jim is a big time Pu**y for the entire movie except for the last 15 minutes where he behaves like Arnold a la COMMANDO style. He neither has the physique nor intelligent to hatch any great ideas. A common guy killing one marine after another is a just logically wrong.7)How can they find a safe place with all the food at the end of the movie. Why can't they go in at the beginning (in that case, we won't have this movie and the world would have been sparred from this torture) The list can go on and on.

A fearful vision follows a weak premise,"With the weak premise of a virus that produces murderous rage in seconds behind, the movie ""28 Days Later"" proceeds to sufficiently apall and frighten its viewers. The premise-monkeys with a rage-producing virus in their blood, are turned loose by some misdirected animal lovers who are immediately attacked and bitten by the monkeys. Those who survive become within seconds ""the infecteds"" who will search for someone to kill-or failing to kill-will create another infected human.We meet our hero, Cillian Murphy, as he awakens from an accident that had kept him-a bicycle courier-in a coma for 28 days. He finds himself in an apparently deserted London. The views of him alone in the city's vastness-surrounded by upended vehicles, garbage, and complete disorganization-are eerily threatening and photographed quite well.He soon finds plenty of dead people in a church and after saying ""Hello"" hesitantly is assaulted by a murderous priest, and some others. He is rescued by two uninfected humans who blow up the pursuers. The female rescuer, Naomi Harris, explains the situation to Murphy while not releasing her hold on a machete. This comes in handy shortly thereafter, when she must kill her partner after he is bitten by an infected human.Apparently the virus has spread all over Britain. There is no TV or radio, nor any government. Survival is paramount, and director Danny Boyle keeps the action moving briskly.Shot in digital video, the film looks like nothing you've seen before-a greater sense of the immediate, perhaps. Murphy soon becomes a survivor like Harris, and with some others, they make their way to a possible military facility they've learned about on a recorded radio broadcast. It soon becomes a question of whether they have made a sensible move.While we know that viruses take time to make people sick, the times we live in now and the threat of bioterror make this film all the more watchable and interesting.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

28 Days Later: 7/10,"Not since the classic Night of the Living Dead have we seen a good, creepy zombie movie. And it looks like it will be awhile more. Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later is barely scary, but if you take it for what it really is, a creative drama, it's pretty good. However, instead of the position of Venus, animal rights activists release contaminated apes to the world, which are infected with rage. 28 days later, Jim (Cillian Murphy) awakes from a coma and finds London completely deserted. He sees some attacking zombies, but Mark (Noah Huntley) and Selena (Naomie Harris) ward them off. Soon he goes along with them to try to find other survivors, but to also try and find a cure.Although there have been attempts, the last good horror film was Identity. 28 Days Later tries to be a horror film by putting in a few quick and semi-suspenseful scenes. All before the final, concluding sequence (which is the film's greatest sequence), are quick, five-second shots of zombies trying to attack people. Boyle has the camera moving so quickly during those sequences it's impossible to tell what's happening. Of course, we could see all of the blood, because there's plenty of it, but at times it looked real, but many times it was false.28 Days Later, which I originally thought was a sequel to the Sandra Bullock romantic comedy 28 Days, really makes itself a good movie by putting in a scenario we've all thought about but never really see in movies. The end of the world is always an interesting subject: when will it happen, how will it occur, etc. This explores one way: an infectious virus. It probably would have played better if we didn't know how London was empty, but the way writer Alex Garland made it work, also.In between those scarce horror sequences, some good drama plays out. We learn more about the virus, but I thought that the relationship between Jim and Selena was very well done. Movies like this have a limited amount of characters, making us like the ones that are there. I wouldn't call it a character-driven piece, nor a character study, but it certainly has interesting characters.If you're looking for a typical zombie-horror movie, look somewhere else. If you want a drama with intense scenes (and an AWESOME score), check out 28 Days Later.My rating: 7/10Rated R for strong violence and gore, language, and nudity.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

#75,"This film follows Jim, a bike courier in London, who wakes up from a month-long coma to find the United Kingdom ravaged by an outbreak.

Overall, due to a haunting score, A young but just as talented Cillian Murphy's intense, and raw performance as Jim, and Naomie Harris's commanding and fierce portrayal of Selena, unique shot selection, gritty cinematography, and a tense, suspenseful atmosphere, this movie is very good, and even though, I don't love the unsatisfying ending and feel the first half is much stronger than the second, I still enjoyed my time with it and this is one of the most realistic and grounded zombie features with a group dynamic that makes you truly care for the characters-something that hurts even more when they are taken from you and having watched it, this is now one of my favorites, and I look forward to seeing how the sequel compares to this bleak yet captivating picture.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

With a cast of relatively unknowns '28 days later' is sure to impress.,"'28 days later' is one of those movies that only comes along once in awhile offering something distinctively new from what we have seen before. It offers a interesting storyline which is believable in the world we live in today. The characters are believable as they fight for survival in some suspenseful moments that are helped by that night, heavy rain and the wonderful lightning that some how seems to flash every five seconds.Though this is probably the best British film I have seen I reckon the ending sucked compared to the vibe of the rest of the movie. It ended too quickly, and the alternate endings on the DVD are pretty pointless.Anyhow this movie is more than what I expected and I hope some of these actors can use this film as the kick-start to their career, or Hollywood.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"Brilliant, but NOT a Zombie movie","Let's get one thing straight first of all. Many reviewers have referred to 'zombies' in this film. It's an easy mistake to make but does colour one's opinion before they have even seen this genuinely frightening tale. Zombies are dead people bought back to life. The 'monsters' in 28 Days Later are still very much alive but infected with the 'Rage Virus', a strange man-made virus that looks like a nasty mixture of rabies and ebola (especially in the way it's passed on).28 Days Later ranks as one of the most disturbing and genuinely unsettling films I have ever seen, a horror story in the true sense of the word. Other's have drawn parallels with Biohazard, the Romero 'zombie' series and Resident Evil. However, if this film has any real debt for it's inspiration, it must lie with the equally disturbing BBC sci-fi/environmental horror serials of the 1970's: Survivors, The Mad Death, and The Day Of The Triffids. The scene where Jim wakes up in hospital and then walks out into a depopulated and devastated London owes so much to John Duttine's similar journey in Douglas Livingston's superb adaptation of Triffids.What made this such an unsettling tale was it's relative believability compared with most horror tales. One can imagine the 'Rage Virus' doing it's worst in real life and anyone who can remember how fast the panic over last Summer's Foot and Mouth outbreak spread can identify with much of this story. Viruses, from Ebola to HIV to Rabies and others are genuinely frightening because the spread so fast and infect at will without us puny humans being able to do much to prevent it. While 'Rage' is purely fictional and the premise of man against nature is an old plot, Alex Garland and Danny Boyle have brought more than a few new wrinkles to the table. Together with Matthew Tildsley's superb production design and excellent performances from the cast, 28 Days Later is an effective and chilling film that MUST be seen. Once seen, it won't be forgotten easily. Especially if you watch back to back with the equally impressive (although slightly sillier) sequel 28 Weeks Later.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"""Disappointing attempt at reviving a dying genre""","A powerful virus escapes from a British research facility. Transmitted in a drop of blood, the virus infects those and turns them into a zombie like creature. Within 28 days the country is overwhelmed and a handful of survivors begin their attempts to salvage a future, little realizing that the deadly virus is not the only thing that threatens them.Here is a little film that could have been a jump start in the horror genre, but with it's 2nd act, it falls apart as it tries to be something more then it actually is. It sells itself as an end of the world, fight for our lives film, and does that successfully for the most part, but when it takes a turn into a more humane state, it fizzles out and loses any interest it once had.Don't get me wrong, I loved the field scene, that was tremendous, the cinematography was really great. The deserted London was probably one things in this movie, that make it watchable. I liked how they weren't you ""typical"" slow moving ""grrr"" zombies, but blood-coughing, running marathon zombies. IF you would call them zombies, or just people infected with ""RAGE"" The military characters are the worse, with the British soldiers being nothing more than your typical foul-mouthed grunts. The clever use of dialogue in ""Dog Soldiers"" was fast and hip, but still built characters, here it most definitely does not.What does set this apart from your other zombie type movies is of course is isolated in London feel to it. The main character wakes up naked, sort of reborn, and finds himself in a new world where people are infected with a virus called rage, that turns them into a zombie like creature. It;s nice to see what people would do in this situation, and we get varies degrees of that.Our heros were in more trouble with other humans then they were with the creatures. By the time we got to the climax you were cheering on the Zombies. I thought the love story felt forced because ""every"" movie needs a love story and I found nothing at all to be thought provoking because it had all been done before. One thing I found odd was the lack of security when the ""activists"" liberate the chimps.Since I had such high hopes for this film and was totally astonished at how terrible the last 20 or so minutes of the film was, a horrible ending did the movie in for me, it became the most disappointing movie of the summer.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Takes the genre to a new modern era.,"The moment this movie got released it already instant basically became a classic. It takes the horror and zombie movies to a new era and already film-makers are starting taking over the movie its style of film-making and approach with its story and concept.""28 Days Later..."" is very original, even though its not. I mean, basically very little original is in the story and the movie actually 'borrows' a lot from much earlier genre movies. Yet ""28 Days Later..."" could and should be regarded as a totally original genre, mostly due to its approach.Leave it up to director Danny Boyle to deliver a good movie with also lots of style and originality. This movie does not pick a classic horror approach in which our main heroes are running from the evil killer zombies, the story is much more layered than that and there are some deeper meanings to the story. For instance in the second halve it becomes apparent that perhaps not the infected are the worst and most dangerous villains around but mankind is actually much more vicious and evil some under circumstances. This is also why I really liked the second halve of the movie, even though it was quite different from the first halve of the movie. I always like movies that completely turn 180 degrees after they are halve way through, at least if its done in a good manner of course.The movie its approach is totally realistic, which also can be seen back in the movie its gritty and dynamic camera-work and the way the overall story progresses and the characters are being developed. I'm also pretty sure that this movie shows an accurate portrayal of the case when an actual epidemic such as this would break out on a large scale. Nothing in this movie ever makes you think; oh that's really not possible or believable! Even though the movie of course features brain dead murderous 'zombies'.But hardened horror fans don't worry. The movie still features plenty of gore and graphic killings for you to enjoy. This movie welcomes a new group of people to the genre but at the same time knows to maintain and please the 'old fashioned' horror-lovers.The movie is also good looking with its settings, which truly enhances the movie its atmosphere. There is nothing scarier than watching a completely deserted London.There are some fine actors in the movie that are all giving some fine and realistic performances. Cillian Murphy can basically play anything and it was this movie that marked his big breakthrough. I'm not a too big fan of Naomie Harris but she is simply good in this movie and plays her role very natural and therefor credible. Further more Brendan Gleeson also plays a fine smaller role. Megan Burns on the other hand is just downward horrible. Pure and simply, she just can't act. It seriously ruins some of the realism and tension of the movie at times. Thank goodness she also hasn't acted in anything every since. Casting her was basically the biggest mistake this movie made.It's already a classic within its genre.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"Fantastic New Horror Film from Director Danny Boyle, the new Zombie standard","Let me first say that  28 Days Later  is one of the best films I've seen in a long time. From the director of Trainspotting, The Beach and Shallow Grave Danny Boyle delivers an edge of your seat Horror movie that will have you leaving the lights on at night and checking the locks on your doors.  The Film is grainy, fast paced and has a  powerful soundtrack  which adds to the very chaotic feel to the movie. This is not a typical `Zombie' movie, the `Infected' in the film are quick, smart and unrelenting this is a nice change from other slow paced sometimes non climatic zombie films such as the classics: Night Of The Living Dead, Day Of The Dead and other films of this genre. Not to say these movies are not up to Zombie par but the heart pumping vision of Danny Boyle's film will make you short of breath rather than fighting to stay awake.All around great acting especially from new comer Cillian Murphy who portrays the lead character `Jim'. From start to finish this character is never really resting running from one scenario to another . Meeting up with interesting characters along the way the small yet effective cast makes it a compelling story.Although the general `last man on earth' concept has been done I believe this film still makes it unique and never boring. So if you're a Horror\Thriller fan and have a strong stomach for some well placed gore than I would strongly suggest giving 28 Days Later a test run, for true Zombie movie fans I think you'll find this a nice twist.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

A memorably visceral experience of horror and adrenaline.,"28 Days Later remains a memorably visceral experience decades after its release, with Danny Boyle's directing leaving a unique fingerprint on could easily have been another generic low-budget zombie horror.Told through the eyes of bicycle courier Jim - a highly relatable everyman portrayed by a young Cillian Murphy - Boyle perfectly captures the gravity of what such a sudden outbreak would not only look like, but feel like. As well as relentless dread, there is a persistent melancholy to the film that feels as much an insurmountable obstacle as the hordes of undead chasing Jim and his companion Selena. Naomie Harris not only demonstrates why she has gone on to have such a long and varied career, but how strong female characters were never a problem in the film industry until they were being written arbitrarily.This signature melancholy is also present in the film's notably striking shots; the film is now deservedly remembered for the impact of the empty streets and quiet landmarks of London city, and of our weary travellers as they optimistically head north towards potential rescue on the M1.The aforementioned relentless dread comes courtesy of the film's zombies, whose manic nature and intense speed not only subvert typical genre tropes, but clash to great effect against the many contemplative moments of hope, grief and futility our characters feel. The reason for their existence - animal rights activists unwittingly releasing infected animals from their cages in the film's bar-raising initial moments - offers an uncomfortable subtext of the real, constant risk of extreme violence we all might face in our daily lives (and what it might bring out in us, for better or worse.) Boyle doesn't land the film's climax by bringing this subtext to the forefront, but it is ever-present and matched in the grimy images Boyle seems to choose with meticulous consideration.Horror fans in particular should not wait further to discover 28 Days Later if they haven't already, while those general viewers with a stomach for gore, or a desire for some genuine cinematic adrenaline, should not be inclined to miss out either.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
A Modern Take on the Classic Zombie Genre,"Zombie movies need something fresh to keep my attention and Danny Boyle has done just that. Instead of the stereotypical shambling undead, Boyle has put his own spin on the genre, avoiding complete cliché while still paying homage to the zombie masters that came before him. The film establishes itself 28 days following an outbreak in London of the rage virus, a mutated form of Ebola passed through blood and saliva in which afflicted become mindlessly violent. The infected are still living and fully mobile, but they appear to lose all higher brain functions and rely solely on aggressive instinct. So, the ""zombies"" in Boyle's film retain some of the classic attributes (such as their brainless nature and the attacks on the uninfected) while integrating a modern scientific angle, playing on the current societal fears of disease and biological weapons.While the movie can be considered a zombie film, I would classify it more as a survival thriller. The focus isn't as much as surviving waves of infected, but follows a group of four as they make their way through a desolate English landscape, avoiding the infected as best as possible and dealing with an even greater danger when they encounter an isolated military outpost. The concept of humans being more dangerous than the infected isn't new, but Boyle does a great job here and it creates a tense final act to the film.Cillian Murphy was great as the main character, Jim, who we first discover as he awakes from a coma and finds the entire city eerily deserted (making for one of the coolest sequences in the film). He is soon joined by Selena (Naomie Harris), Frank (Brendan Gleeson), and Frank's daughter Hannah (Megan Burns). Gleeson always makes for a great film presence and Harris was a strong counter to Murphy's optimistic outlook. I found the greatest performance came from Christopher Eccleston as Major Henry West, the head of the military outpost. He comes off as charming and you want to trust him in his position of authority but you soon find he is as corrupt as those who follow his orders.Boyle's film is a zombie film without being a zombie film. The cast do a good job of creating complex characters and you always find yourself hoping they pull through. Boyle's film helped pave the way for the modern zombie cinema, in which the iconic masses aren't necessarily slow-shambling flesh-eaters, but frighteningly effective animals. 28 DAYS LATER is light on scares, but instead focuses on the suspense and tension around finding yourself in such an apocalyptic scenario and for that, I think it's great.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
This deserves more than 7.5 stars,"This is by far the best zombie movie of all time. Not only was it the start of an entire of era of zombie flicks involving fast paced and aggressive ""infected"", but it also made the zombie legitimately scary. The way this movie is filmed, the way the zombies is portrayed is... truly scary. This film may have a slightly odd final act, but the scene where Cilian murph is walking through a barren London is enough for me to say this movie is something special. For me, this is not only the best zombie movie but a true work of art - a focal point for the entire horror genre. To me this movie is a solid 9.5/10 and it put it in my top 10 movies of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Smart and Scary,"A trio of well-meaning animal rights activists break into an experimental lab somewhere in England, intent on freeing the monkeys within. The only problem is that the monkeys, cruelly wired up and forced to watch loops of violent images, have been injected with ""rage,"" a neuro-stimulant which produces uncontrollable homicidal anger. Within seconds, one of the activists has been infected by a monkey bite. 28 Days Later (a ha, we have a title!) nearly all of England, and possibly the rest of the world, has been decimated.Enter Jim, a young bicycle courier whose last memory was being struck by a car. He wakes up in an empty hospital and soon wanders out into the wasteland that Britain has become with no idea of what has happened while he was asleep. He soon comes face to face with the hordes of infected, as well as with a handful of survivors, including a tough, pretty girl named Selena and a father and daughter who have turned their London flat into a fortress.I have heard ""28 Days Later"" compared to ""Dawn of the Dead"" (the 1978 version) more than once, although ""28 Days Later"" is not a zombie film, per se. It is indeed a ""plague apocalypse"" film, and a damn good one at that. The infected definitely do resemble zombies...really incredibly FAST zombies; no shuffling Fulci monsters here. The virus spreads quickly and is most often spread by bites from an infected, not unlike the zombie contagion. There's even a free shopping spree scene a la ""Dawn of the Dead."" But there's also a scene like that in ""Night of the Comet"" and I don't hear as many comparisons drawn between that film and DOTD as this one. ""28 Days Later"" is an intelligent, tense and powerful film, more than able to stand on its own no matter what it may or may not have been inspired by. The second half of the film, which finds our small band of heroes ensconced within a pseudo-military base with a handful of crude and desperate soldiers, is more harrowing and tense than any scene up to that point. Once again, it is the humans who are to be feared, not the monsters outside, and a deadly three-way battle between humans, soldiers and infected was both frightening and exhausting to watch. Everyone turns in an excellent performance, and a highly satisfactory ending left me exhilarated.This is truly one of the best and most original new horror movies I have yet seen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Brain Dead,"Hey, I love post apocalypse movies...but this one really stinks!The idea is brilliant but o-my-god the delivery stinks! Could someone please tell these idiots that eventually the zombies will starve and they will be safe to go outside again? And since when do folks loose all vestiges of humanity in 28 days? (On second thought, it happened in a few days of no food or water during Katrina.) Well, I guess as a zombie movie it works (zombie movies are supposed to be demented) but I was hoping for a really gripping deadly virus flick and was sorely disappointed.If you want a good virus movie...watch 'The Andromeda Strain.'

Above-Average and Character-Driven,"I'm going to start off with my pettiest criticism so that you'll forget how cheap I am by the time you're finished reading: This movie starts off by establishing that animal rights activists are at fault for spreading the ""rage"" virus because they set lab animals free from their cages, only to find out too late that they've been turned into foaming, savage predators. I'm not saying that Alex Garland, the screenwriter, vilified animal rights activists on purpose, but isn't that the overall effect of the scene? That they're ignorant, malevolent anarchists who don't know what they're doing and cause massive destruction? I find that highly contemptible. But the rest of the film is fine.I remember when this film was released it was a breakthrough for both Cillian Murphy and the use of grainy, gritty digital video cinematography in mainstream movies. By now, we've already been introduced to the latter. When the former awakens in an empty hospital and leaves, he finds a forsaken London. In a sequence of astounding shots, he wanders with not a single person within reach, seeing from old wind-beaten newspapers of a virus that twisted human beings against itself.So opens this character-driven take on the post-apocalyptic horror movie, which starts as an above-average horror film and continues as an stimulating, however action-packed, inquiry of human nature (and yes, only human. In spite of the fact that this spread from chimps, there don't seem to be any animals that attack or are attacked by the rage-infected).Though famously indecisive regarding how to end this movie, director Danny Boyle, who by this time had made the enduring contemporary landmark Trainspotting, gives his sci-fi drama an abrupt documentary impression, making the film scarier through being more realistic, while at the same time making the movie less expensive. It makes you wonder about the formula credibility of movies like this: A more expensive film would have had more traditional action heroes, and less screen time in what would be a less patient stride to expand the gradually familial relationship between the unusual characters, each of them being everyday people transformed by inescapable circumstance. Throw enough money into this movie's broad concept, and it would have the penetration of the Resident Evil films or the Dawn of the Dead remake. Garland's script develops characters who seem to have a reality at a distance from their part in the plot, whose behavior determines what they do, where they go, and why.Naomie Harris's seemingly inscrutable, at first less than approachable black female becomes the bossy member of the intimate cluster, wearing the toughest and least emotional shell, imposing a hardened survivalist boundary. Timid Cillian Murphy would probably have died if he hadn't met her. Sooner or later they find solace with two other survivors: Brendan Gleeson's genial and resourceful father and his teenage daughter Hannah, of whom he is strongly protective. They've overwhelmingly fortified in a high-rise apartment, and use their hand-cranked radio to receive a broadcast from an Army unit near Manchester. Should they count on the broadcast and journey to what is illustrated as a safe haven? After some debate, the group, who seems to bond more and more every minute, resolves that the smartest thing to do is to take the chance.In a lesser film, and almost certainly an American one, there would be a sex scene between Murphy and Harris, but Boyle and Garland's work finds the fitting pitch in an instant where she pecks him on the cheek, and he's the one that blushes.The rage-infecteds bring up questions like, How long can one live once infected? Since London seems empty at the beginning, I assume the infecteds we see were survivors until somewhat lately. Another thought: Seeing as they run in hordes, why don't they attack one another? Its driving strand of the zombie-like outbreak seems allegorical, the film punctuates its assertion of a human's most rudimentary self in the climactic scene, which fulfills every ounce of pent-up aggression in you, the viewer, and though the third act does not quite live up to the promise of the first two, this climactic bloodbath is the highest point of the film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Danny Boyle should make more horror.,"Twenty-eight days after a powerful virus known as 'rage' escapes from an animal experimentation lab, injured cycle courier Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes from a coma to discover that, while he has been asleep, the country has been overwhelmed by the infected, who are crazed, bloodthirsty, and surprisingly fleet of foot.Although I'm not the biggest fan of Danny Boyle's oeuvre as a whole, I do love me a good zombie film, and 28 Days Later is one of the finest examples that the genre has to offer (OK, I know that they are not technically zombies, but as poet James Whitcomb Riley once wrote, ""when I see a bird that walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck).Not only does the film offer intense horror by the bucket-load, but it also manages to deliver heart-rending pathos, dark comedy and nail-biting action, thanks to a raft of central characters you actually give a damn about, a gripping script from Alex Garland that wisely keeps matters within the realms of believability, and Boyle's stylish direction that combines stunning cinematography (considering the digital format on which it was shot) with frantic, hand-held footage of the type that often sends me into fits of rage myself, but which works brilliantly in this instance. Also adding immensely to the overall atmosphere is the excellent original music by John Murphy, which works particularly well in the early scene in which Jim wanders the deserted streets of London, the score building to a crescendo as he gradually comes to understand his predicament.I know it's highly unlikely, now that Boyle has snagged himself Academy Award for Best Director, but I reckon the guy should tackle more horror (but NOT sci-fi/horror: Sunshine sucked!).",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Not your usual film. Check it out.,"Wasn't expecting such a powerful film from people I was not at all familiar with. OK, the quibbles and plot holes first: True enough for those who say ""where are all the cars?"" I would add ""Where are all the corpses?"" When Jim (Cillian Murphy) awakens at the hospital, there should probably have been enough corpses there to clue him in that really bad stuff was going on. And all that death in a city the size of London would likely stink fifty miles away, from masses of rotting food, etc., as well as the dead. Clearly the reason for these omissions was to prolong the character's state of confusion. (And to pay a bit of homage to ""The Omega Man"") And it is never explained why the infected do not attack one another. And there was something weird about the photography that was quite irritating. But, having said all that, not many movies leave me thinking about them three days later, like this one did. Anyone who likes sci-fi, horror, or disaster flicks has to see 28DL.

When 'The Omega Man' and George Romero's Trilogy  Are Revisited,"Three activists invade a laboratory with the intention of releasing some monkeys and chimps. What they do not know is that these animals are under experience, infected by the virus of rage. The activists are immediately killed and the animals escape. Twenty-eight days later, Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up from a comma alone in a abandoned hospital. He leaves the place and finds out that London is desert, apparently without a living soul. Then, he meets Selena (Naomie Harris) and her friend Mark (Noah Huntley) and he is informed that all the population died. People got infected by the monkeys, and the infected ones attacked the survivals. Jim decides to go home with the new friends and see what might have happened with his parents. Then, they are rescued by Frank (Breendan Gleeson) and his daughter Hannah (Megan Burns). They listen to a broadcast message from Manchester and they decide to go to the place guided by the broadcasting. .

Surprising,"Prior to watching this film, I had seen countless poor horror films that I had almost given up on the genre. I had seen this film advertised though and seeing it was a British film I decided to 'give it a go' so to speak. I am so glad I did.The film itself brings out a whole new light to the traditional zombie horror films over the years. Granted the film isn't really a true zombie film as the victims are subject of a disease rather than just rotting corpses but they have the same lust for blood as other films portray.Keeping a film like this fresh is a tough achievement but this film is boosted by fast-moving zombies and a great feeling of loneliness which lingers throughout the film making this film one to think about as well as just to watch.All in all this is a great, fast-paced horror film and by far one of the best of its type to emerge over the past few years.

The virus wasn't causing this chaos as such, but bringing to the surface the vile,ravenous bloodthirsty base urges within all of us.The rage is a virus, but only metaphorically- in the form of an increasingly angry,violent society...that people aren't really as civilised as they would like to think, and that anyone could go mad with rage and that the real horror of this film was in the blood red grotesqueness of human nature- not some mutant super-virus.

Exemplary film making,"Dawn of the Dead, The Omega Man, Night of the Living Dead. They all pale in comparison.This film should be shown to every student studying Film as an example of how it is done. Full stop.Some of the shots and camera angles are genuinely thrilling. The whole film could be played out as a series of still frames with no sound as each shot is fresh, imaginative and tells us a little bit more about the story, the characters or the situation.Although it may sound as if the whole film is based on superficial shots that are there to please the eye, it is certainly not the case. It is impossible to point out any aspect of the film that is a let down.The acting is real quality, Cillian Murphy gives an utterly convincing performance as Jim who is trying to come to terms with the situation he finds himself in, making even the line, ""Hello"", memorable! Naomie Harris puts in a real composed and confident turn. But the man who really stands out in this film for me is Brendan Gleeson, he really is a cracking actor, he plays 'Frank' with so much warmth that you genuinely care for him. The three characters (and the actors) along with Frank's daughter really work well together.The sound is amazing, the accurate choice of music for each scene can be compared to that of ""The Shining"". The quality of the overall sound (music and effects) are top notch.Overall, the film is an unbelievable example of sheer quality coming together to create a film that, over time, will prove to be legendary.

Is there any genre Danny Boyle can't do?,"A very well made, thinking person's zombie movie. This avoids most of the silliest elements of the genre, adds some very clever twists, and interesting complex characters. It still doesn't quite rise to being a great movie, through a combination of not really exploring the many political and social themes it hints at (George Romero takes that further), and pushing its internal logic pretty far at times. But it's always entertaining, has a lot of genuine suspense, and isn't over- reliant on easy scares and shocks.

Best horror movie in 30 years....NOT!,"This movie is a brutally realistic movie about the days following a virus that wipes out the entire United Kingdom.  It has some fantastic shots of London absolutely deserted, which make it amazing to imagine, but none the less this film has one major downfall..... it's got far too much talking and not enough action.It is rated as an 18 and yet it has almost 20 minute intervals(or so it seems) between disgusting, gorey murders and attacking scenes. Not to say I'm only there for the blood and guts, but it is portrayed as a zombie film so i didn't expect a deep and meaningful discussion every time they changed location.The only thing that made this film more bearable was the black comedy one liners, which made it so much easier to watch.  In fact I would go as far as to say, that if this had been a video I would have quite easily fast forwarded it at least 2 or 3 times as the story line was going nowhere.I'm not saying don't go to see this because if you like ""zombie"" films, that's what it is but please don't expect wall to wall action because you will sorely disappointed.Marks out of 10  -  6.5 ( and that's higher because of the humour)",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Although the actors are not that known they do an excellent job. The action is tense and will keep you at the edge of your seat. The plot is well structured and has no gaps or what so ever.What makes this film so unique is that it introduces us a new ""zombie race"". These ""infected people"" don't resemble at all the classical Romero style of zombies. The infected people can run very fast and be killed more easily. They also need to remain in a dark place since they cannot stand sunlight.This movie is also one of the only horror movies that try to send a message to the audience. In this case we are warned that infections and viruses are not taken too seriously and that they can develop into something similar to what's shown in the film: spreading fast and killing people.Overall, one of the best 21th century horror films.

Another part that was retarded is he let loose the chained up mindless mutant in the compound. I guess he knew that it would kill everyone except the two females.

Of course, the setting of the movie is way different than the setting of the book: alien world vs our civilization in the present, Nightfall vs a virus, and the characters don't match, of course. But the overall plot is similar:-It all starts by a massive tragedy that causes people to go mad-After the thing started, a group of survivors tries to find others-In both the movie and the book, the initial goal of this group is to reach a place where supposedly those who survived are all going-The militaries in the movie think they are a bastion of order in the chaos and that it is up to them to get civilization going again, intime. In the book, recall the Fire Patrol episode?-The scene where they are on a highway and in the distance a city is burning is very very similar to a scene described in the bookDon't you think it's too many coincidences? Maybe the story in the movie was inspired by Asimov's?",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
The world can end in a heartbeat,"This is intense right off the bat. We are quickly given the backstory, and then we wake up in abandoned, post-apocalyptic UK. The atmosphere and tension grow as we realize what the situation is. While the third act is unexpected and different from(not worse than, mind you) the first two, this is excellent throughout. It is a long trip down a dark tunnel with the occasional crack that lets in a little light, without removing the fear that you won't make it out. This focuses on a small group of characters, and uses that well, developing them and the relationships between them, letting us connect to them. The acting is great; Murphy throws himself at this and explores a wide range of emotional states. This doesn't overstimulate the viewer, but it does come pretty close, as it is rather bleak. The pace is even, and this isn't moves smoothly. Not always fast(well, the story does), but there is a constant real sense of threat and danger. This is one of the three times Garland and Boyle work together(The Beach and Sunshine), and they compliment each other well each time. The energetic visual style of Danny has your eyes glued to the screen, and this, shot on DV(for a grainy, ""authentic"" picture quality... except for a flashback, that they used Super 8 for... brilliant) puts you right in the situations with hand-held and dynamic cinematography(and the Infected are filmed in a specific manner, rendering them far creepier). This was on a budget, and they faced their limitations, not taking on anything they couldn't accomplish. If you don't know, you can't really tell that this was looking like they might not have enough money to complete it. The music tends to fit the mood where it is used. There is a little humor, and the dialog is natural and well-written. This is psychologically accurate. As this kind of movie ought to, this brings up some philosophical ideas and isn't just about ""boy, don't you hope these people live"". It was smart of them to choose vira as the source, as those are scary today, and the concept here is a mental, not physical, change. They applied a lot of research about people in extremis. Is this a zombie flick? Depends on how strict your definition of that is. It's changed(have you seen one from before Romero began his trilogy?) before. You could call it a reinterpretation of them, or action/survival horror. There is a lot of disturbing content, a bit of blood and violence(little gore or brutality to it, and it mostly isn't as direct as is often the case today), a moderate amount of strong language in this and brief male nudity including full frontal.

Not really as terrifying as I thought but a very unique movie nonetheless...,"There is something odd about the way movie promotion teams make their movies look like what they actually aren't, weather it's with terms of genre or quality.

I saw it because it was playing on Channel 4 not too long ago, playing in the same room where I was busy on the computer I use and I slowly found myself watching it out of blind curiosity so then after getting into it, I logged off and started watching it properly and I was very delightfully surprised by it.I do not consider ""28 Days Later"" as a horror of any real kind but I more consider it as a very tense sci-fi thriller. This is great for people like me who really are not fans of the horror genre but that said, the movie still has some haunting elements and quite a bit of bloody violence so people who love horror wouldn't feel too disappointed neither. There are a lot of other reasons why this movie is so unique, it's use of digital video to shoot the more intense scenes is an ingenious idea and makes the whole experience even more adrenaline-filled, exciting and in the right moments, a bit scary too.Other things to mention is that the story is very clever and the screenplay by Alex Garland delivers it incredibly well without lacking in any place throughout the movie, the direction by Danny Boyle is very professionally done, the score by John Murphy is very original and atmospheric and the acting is superb, especially for a movie like this.So to round things up, if you don't like horror, ""28 Days Later"" is the best alternative to the genre around.

Romero (who made the daring ""Living Dead"" trilogy and basically defined a new genre of horror film-making), it's not a zombie flick because the so-called ""living dead"" in this movie are still technically alive, just... ""infected.""That's about all I'm going to say about that, instead I'm going to turn my focus to the craft and ingenuity that went into this film's production. Even if one wants to call it a zombie flick (I'm not going to disagree with anyone that does), the horror and gore take a backseat to a larger social question about human nature: Is it in our blood to kill?Alex Garland might think so, since the virus has to be in the blood to infect its victim and transform them into what they are in the film. And if someone does get infected, any survivors around have 20 seconds (or is it 30?) to kill them before the infected individual has a chance to wreak havoc.I missed this movie when it laid siege to the theaters last summer and proceeded to scare the daylights out of its viewers. But in today's times, an observant person might assume that this movie provides a valuable commentary about the dangerous days that we're living in. The American people are scared and ""28 Days Later..."" may have provided the jolts we needed to shake us out of our disillusionment with modern times.An MTV (MTV?) special I watched a while ago talked about how people want to be scared out of their wits nowadays; just look at the massive success of movies like ""Cabin Fever"" (another movie about a deadly virus on the loose) or Zack Snyder's remake of Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead,"" which was released earlier this year.""28 Days Later..."" is an eerie and frightening film that I highly recommend to any horror fan or anyone who wants to escape reality and slip into another darker, deadlier one.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Very interesting...not at all what I thought it would be.,"I went into this film expecting nothing more than another ""Texas Chainsaw massacre' or 'Friday the 13th'. I was completely wrong, while it does have some of the elemnts from those films, this film is light years ahead of them. I found it to be interesting, thought provoking and very intertaining. Every film has faults, and I would consider this film as to having only a few (my biggest gripe is that infections take 10-15 seconds...no virus moves that fast..but hey it is Hollywood, or Londonwood, whatever). One striking point that I find interesting that no one has hit on it yet is the fact that the one group of 'cilivized' people we find in the story has literally lowered themselves to barbaric levels in our to survive. The major says he has pulled these men together by promising them a reward of plenty of women! To make them civilized and organized he has to promise them a reward of plenty of woemn to have their way with. So the root moral out of this movie that I got, was that even when we are reduced to the barest levels of our morality, we will still be nothing more than animals. Anyway, I found this movie to be much better than I thought it could be. Definately a movie I would recommend to others to watch, but don't go in thinking this is nothing more than a brappy slasher film, you will be disappointed as it makes you think. ;-)",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

A scary and thought provoking film,"It has been said that people can walk a thin line between sanity and madness. What is one to do then when there is nothing to check the madness and it is unleashed in its purest most animalistic form without a hint of sanity or compassion? <P> This is the problem facing Jim (Cillian Murphy), who awakens in a hospital to find himself alone and the city of London deserted. Jim has been in a coma for the past few weeks and comes to learn that a virus has decimated the country turning people into rage obsessed killing machines who's blood and saliva infects people 10-20 seconds after contact turning them into the same. <P> The virus was the result of a lab experiment that was unleashed by some well-meaning but stubborn activists who ignored the lab staff's warnings that the animals they were trying to free are highly contagious and very dangerous. <P> Eventually Jim finds some survivors named Selena (Naomie Harris), Frank (Brendan Gleeson), and his daughter Hannah (Megan Burns), and they team up for survival from the hordes of rage-infected hordes that often hide by day and seek out victims by night. With basic need such as food, water, electricity, and security in short supply, the group heads off in Frank's taxi towards the direction of Manchester based upon a repeating radio broadcast that offers sanctuary for anyone who can hear it and encourages them to travel to the location.<P> Up to this point, `28 Days Later' is a very intriguing and gripping film, what follows next is a bizarre yet frantic chain of events that takes the film into new directions, and leaves portions of the film open to interpretation by the audience. <P> The survivors eventually meet up with a small unit of military men who while promising protection from the hordes, soon find themselves facing new dangers and dealing with unforeseen enemies who are every bit as deadly.<P> While I will try to avoid exposing any more of the plot then I have, I found the film to be a very ambitious and unsettling work by Director Danny Boyle, who made a name for himself with such classics as `Trainspotting' and `Shallow Grave'. `28 Days Later' is at times a very violent film that shows the inner save that many believe lurks inside all of us. It seems that Boyle is drawn to stories that show the darker side of the soul and that how ordinary benevolent people can be driven to extreme actions when pushed. I found the climax of the film to be very gripping in how it showed the duality between rage that is unchecked and that, which is contained by the rules of society and restraint. But when society breaks down, the urge to survive and procreate can drive a person to their basic animal instincts. It is an interesting duality for this gripping and disturbing film. Boyle is to be commended for taking what easily could have been a typical zombie movie and producing a film that not only scares the audience, it makes them think.<P>3.5 stars out of 5 <P> Gareth Von Kallenbach <P> gareth@nwlink.com www.sknr.net <P> International Association of Film Critics",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Not just another zombie flick,"28 days later has cannibalistic people infected by a virus spreading through bites, who mindlessly chases the few uninfected people for their flesh. Seen this before? You are bound to have. With the increasing popularity of the zombie genre, it can often feel like you've watched a zombie flick before it has barely begun. However, for this very reason, a lot of the more recent zombie movies try to add something unique to their movie to make it stand out of the crowd. For this particular movie, the repeated use of hope as a factor that keeps the characters fighting on, has worked out really well. The movie also adds an additional danger, just as the characters starts to feel safe from the infected, to make sure the viewers stays at the edge of their seat.Why should you watch this movie?Well the characters are very all very well done, and in spite of the relatively low budget this movie had, the characters are very believable. Cillian Murphy does a great job as Jim, the main character, who goes through the process of being completely unaware of what has happened around him, to becoming a strong yet vengeful man. This also leads to one of the best action scenes I've ever seen in a horror movie, which only gets better as the amazing theme song starts playing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
An homage to John Wyndham's Day of the Triffids,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, though that's no surprise as I have a penchent for post-apocalyptical flicks, though it bears an uncanny likeness to John Wyndham's Day of the Triffids book (you must read it!) and the BBC's early 1980's adaption thereof.From the patient in hospital beginning, to the light from the tower to guide our heroes, to the barrackaded safe-house at the end it reeks of Wyndham. But until some visionary in the industry sees the potential in the Triffid story for a decent film version (the Hollywood 50's version bears almost no resemblance to the original story) this'll do.It sures makes a change for the Zombies to be able to run like sprinters.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

"Not just one of the greatest horror movies; a great movie, period.","I will never forget that afternoon. I had been working overnight and into the next day cleaning up an IT mess at the office. By four in the afternoon I was exhausted and on my way home, and while waiting for the bus I decided I was a little wired in that way you sometimes are after an all-nighter, and decided to go take in a bad horror movie downtown to unwind before heading home. I knew nothing about 28DL except for having caught a glimpse of the commercials and figured there was no way a good zombie movie would ever come out in 2002. A brain-dead, terrible horror movie was exactly what I needed.Hooooooooooo was I wrong. I was fully unprepared for it to be not just a good horror movie, not even just a good movie period, but an absolutely stupendous one.There are a few horror movies that transcend the horror genre and are must-see films for any film buff: Rosemary's Baby. The Exorcist. The Shining. And 28 Days Later.Danny Boyle at the time was know primarily for Trainspotting, which probably deserved the accolades it got, although personally it wasn't a favorite of mine. But this... this was like he took all the work he put into making Trainspotting clever, and funny, and memorable, and redirected all that effort this time into one single goal: telling a good story. And this is a masterpiece of storytelling, in a way so few horror movies even bother to be. Horror movies tend to be an exercise in nothing but shock or scares, and plot and character take a back seat. But Boyle has no problem spacing out the horror sequences with moments of poignancy, beauty and emotional depth, as well showing as a more profound understanding of what makes horror work than most genre directors. The scene where he returns to his parents' house has some zombies in it, sure, but they only arrive after the true horror of that scene, which I won't risk having to post a spoiler alert to detail but I'm sure anyone who has seen it will remember that scene's incredibly quiet gut-punch forever. Then there are the quietly poetic interludes like the long minutes of Jim wandering a surreally empty London, the quiet overnight interlude in the ruins with the feral horses and Jim's surreal dream of running sheep, the dozens of rainbuckets sitting empty on Frank's rooftop showing why they can't stay in his apartment, or the image of Hannah running down the dark mansion halls in her red dress during the climactic sequence... it's very easy to forget how much of this film is not zombie action at all, just good old-fashioned movie storytelling. In fact, despite the some very memorable conventional horror scenes (like Jim's strange first encounter with the infected, before it is revealed to him what has happened) not that much of the screentime of this film is really horror scenes, and not that much the horror in this film comes from zombies. In many ways the ""zombie infection"" is just a backdrop to provide a setting for the deeper horrors in this movie.The reason I give it a 9-and, I'd have given it a 9 1/2 if that was possible-is the open-aperture camerawork for the action sequences, which was more of a cheap, flashy concession to ""ooh, look what we can do"" technological novelty than a good cinematic decision. It was faintly interesting at first glance, but not up to snuff with virtually verything else about the film, not even really neccessary, and hasn't aged well, even ignoring how quickly it became an overused cliche in less original zombie movies made in the shadow of this one.But that is the sole flaw, and a minor one, in one of the all-time great horror film masterpieces and really one of my favorite films, regardless of genre. This film is the result of an expert filmmaker at the top of his game, setting out to demonstrate that a great director can make great art in even the least-appreciated genre, and unquestionably succeeding. This is a really, really great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Scary movie,Scary movie. This film makes you jump many times but once you have got used to the formula about half way through you probably will start to hope for some meaning or message. If you do you will be disappointed...its just one of those movies that says 'all we have to do is survive' and that means killing a lot of zombies. There's some terrible acting from the young girl and some really offensive cliches that make most army types out to be potential rapists. The ending can be easily guessed and some of the supposedly poignant moments are just rubbish - watching some horses frolicking stands out as particularly pathetic. If you like shock/horror stuff then you will like this but its ultimately pointless throwaway stuff.

Savagery in it's most compelling form,"I have to say I liked this film a lot. It was different than some other horror movies I've seen. Sure, it borrowed from some of George Romero's films, but it still was original in it's own way. I liked the fact that it was filmed digitally. It really gave the movie a gritty, real feeling. The performances were great. Especially Cillian Murphy, as Jim. He fit his character very well. This is the first UK Horror/sci-fi film I've seen, and it was refreshing to get away from typical Teen slashers. I cared about the characters here, to me they were very likable, and realistic.

Compelling world building but a mixed execution,"This movie, about a handful of survivors who try to find sanctuary, is an okay disaster movie.I really like its world building. A dystopian United Kingdom has been filled with infected people, and there is only a few survivors left. I also like the sense of the world. It is not that Hollywoodesque but rather more realistic and colder. To add, Cillian Murphy's performance as the protagonist is great and never disappoints. Anyway, my experience has some shortcomings. Director Danny Boyle has a peculiar style and is usually not my taste. He does not have that cinematic style, which I usually rather prefer. The movie lacks color grading, and the camera uses lenses I personally would not have used. As for the story, I think it is mostly good itself but it has some pacing issues, making it somewhat bland to be honest, especially the second act. Anyway, I still look forward to the movie's successors.This movie delivers a chilling, realistic dystopia with strong performances, particularly from Murphy. However, Boyle's stylistic choices and pacing issues limit its impact. Despite these flaws, the movie's unique world-building ensures lasting intrigue and sets the stage for its sequels.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

The actors are good, the writing/directing is failing here. I really don't know what to add to this review, everything is so foreseeable. When I started the movie I hoped for the best and feared the worst, but in the end the second version came. The whole plot was thinned down to a male-female, badboy-goodboy cliché.

Quite Good Movie,"This film feels more like a meditation on what happens to people when they are reduced to their lowest elements. A friend of mine told me that this movie's running zombies was what inspired the zombies in the remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"",but where ""Dawn of..."" was pretty much a full-throttle action/horror hybrid from about start to finish,this film plays more like a ""What if..."" movie,with less emphasis on the creatures themselves and more on the (lucky?) survivors. There are also disturbing lessons on the nature OF survival,too.When environmental terrorists attack a lab that contains diseased chimps who are infected with a ""Rage"" virus, they unwittingly let loose a plague that lays waste to England and(perhaps)the rest of society. The 28 Days later of the title cuts to a mostly abandoned London where a coma-tized bicycle courier named Jim(Cillian Murphy,effective) wakes from his stasis to find himself alone in a hospital. As he searches London for signs of life,he is rescued from raging zombies by a couple of survivalists(one of them,the lovely Naomie Harris)who he follows from place to place to keep alive. From there,he also meets a man and his daughter(Brendan Gleeson,terrific,and Megan Burns,good)and they try to find a refuge out of London-town. A recorded message of a ""paradise"" where ""salvation"" can be found is tracked by Frank(the man) on his shortwave radio.I'm not sure if 28 Days Later will be everyone's cup of tea. Some of the horror and science fiction fans out there will immediately hear of this film, see a preview or a TV ad, or even see it, and dismiss it as phooey rubble borrowed from the video-store. I can see their points of view, since I saw many similarities in Romero and some other films (the military scenes reminded me of Day of the Dead, though the chained up Zombie in this was done for more practical reasons, and the supermarket scene is a little unneeded considering the satirical reverence it had in Dawn of the Dead). But what they should understand is that Boyle isn't making a 100% original film, and no one could at this point of the genre's history. He has done, however, the most credible job he could in getting a different tone, a different setting in country, and of a different, enveloping view of the scene structures. Overall, 28 Days Later is constructed and executed like most sci-fi horror films you've ever seen, and like not many other sci-fi horror films you've ever seen combined, in a sense, for a modern audience: fascinating throughout.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

A First Rate Zombie Film,"""Jim"" (Cillian Murphy) wakes up in a hospital room and finds everyone gone. So, he ventures into the street and finds the entire city of London deserted. Or so he thinks. When he walks into a church he is attacked by a zombie-like person from which he barely manages to escape. Suddenly, even more begin to attack him and he is rescued in the nick of time by ""Mark"" (Noah Huntley) and ""Selena"" (Naomi Harris). Taking him to a safe haven they explain the viral epidemic which has taken over Great Britain and left the three of them terribly outnumbered. At any rate, rather than giving all of the details to this movie, I will just say that this is a first-rate zombie film. Both Noah Huntley and Naomi Harris do an outstanding job as does the director, Danny Boyle. Now, I fully understand that there are a couple of differences with these zombies which contrast with the more traditional view. For starters, these zombies don't stumble along like ""normal"" zombies. They run. Very fast. They also don't seem to need the mandatory ""headshot"" that ""normal"" zombies require. Claymore mines and machine guns seem to do the trick quite nicely. Likewise, while they attack humans, I didn't see them feasting on human flesh so much. But that may have been understood and therefore considered unnecessary to show. Additionally, their ability to infect humans is much faster than usual. Sometimes as quickly as 10 seconds. So in that respect there isn't much response time or waiting around. Still, all things considered I really liked this movie and I think most zombie fans will too.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Finally a smart fun horror flick with a totally drool worthy lead.,"This movie ROCKED!!! Not only has Danny Boyle made the first zombie movie with zombies that are actually scary, but he's also managed to make an intelligent film that asks (if not answers) some interesting questions about human nature and what it means to survive. Boyle offers up for our consideration three very different possible forms of survival, i.e. Selena and Mark's, Frank and Hannah's, or the Army boys', each of which seems to work just fine up until it is threatened by the ideas of another. Is survival itself the only  thing that's important? Would one method of survival work better than another?  Is there a morally 'better' way of continuing when the world has gone to hell?  Does  morally exist in the face of extinction and death? Would the rest of the  world quarantine Britain and sacrifice its people to protect itself? Perhaps the  film never truly answers these questions, perhaps it doesn't even try, but the fact  is, it brought them up and I could kiss the writer for doing that. Too often horror films, and films of other genres rely so heavily on the conventions of their types  that they fail to ask the questions which naturally arise from their subjects and I  commend the makers of 28 Days Later for not falling into this idiotic, mind- numbing routine. Also, I think it brilliant that the filmmakers were able to create  such and tense and thrilling atmosphere given the relatively few shots and sequence with the zombies. The music, the cinematography and the editing all come together in this film to deliver classic horror movie chills which had me  glued to my seat my knees pulled into my chest the whole time. And finally the  characters, and they are great characters, were so evidently what the filmmakers chose to focus on and for good reason. Jim and Selena both cores of the film are a fabulous horror film pair, I love strong women in horror films,  and i think that the players did fabulous jobs with making the audience empathize, and genuinely care for them.  I think they are two fabulous young actors and I for one wish them great success.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Shocks;  scares; an excellent attitude to horror as a genre and some excellent character observations render 28 Days Later one of the greats.,"The streets are empty; the nation is crumbling, with cities either deserted or on fire; whatever event that has rendered the enemies of the film of the uncanny variety has been unleashed; only a small band of human survivors remain and nobody seems to have much of a plan. So arrived in cinemas back in 2002 a relatively familiar premise for a horror film, to be shot on digital video and staring a ragtag bunch of unfamiliar acting talent attempting to get across the raw fear and sensations of finding oneself in this predicament. The film was helmed by Englishman Danny Boyle; who was getting back to scuzzy, low level based pictures much in the vein of his earlier feature Trainspotting, this following the bleached out and visually alluring 2000 effort The Beach. It's to everyone's great credit that 28 Days Later holds up as one of my favourite horror films, and one of my favourite overall films of the decade.With a 2007 sequel following it; a cast of actors who have since gone on to bigger and richer things as well as a director who has consequently churned out equally nourishing film-going experiences in Sunshine and Slumdog Millionaire, revisiting 28 Days Later after however long it's been is strangely humbling. Set on the ""diseased, decaying island"", as one character calls it, that is Britain; 28 Days Later gets across scares; knows when to provide the sequences of gore; is able to provide an adequate number of suspenseful set-pieces; knows how to pace and where to place its scenes of terror and realisation of the overall situation while its instances of comedy and attention to character are equally seamlessly woven in.The film carries a very broad, quite epic feel to it. While similar in genre and premise, the film is the polar opposite to something like 2002's Resident Evil, or that respective film's first sequel. For all the money and gimmicks thrown at the screen in those films, what with their vast and expansive underground laboratory locales; lots of attention to fight scene aesthetics; inclusion of all things scientific and 'smart' sounding; nonsense narratives that flesh out into company cover-ups and so on, 28 Days Later works ten times as better with its stripped down and simplistic sense. It's to Boyle's great credit he achieves this with limited money and a shooting format more akin to student pieces than feature films due for cinematic release are. All the film does in vacate a location; spread a few discarded props here and there and bingo: you've got something is so simple yet so effective.The film begins with found footage of riots; if we go into the film with knowledge of the premise, we might feel a little underwhelmed at the use of such footage to 'act' as a representation that the 'zombies' are taking over and that the world is falling apart. But no, these are VT's being pumped into the minds of chimps as a new 'rage' virus is tested in a science lab somewhere in England. Animal activists, however, have different ideas and when an infected chimp gets out – all Hell breaks loose. When we first see Irish protagonist Jim (Murphy), he is lying stark naked on a hospital bed, all by himself, with wires and tubes coming out of him from every which way. Jim's progression from vulnerable and somewhat pathetic looking individual; to hospital cloak-clad scavenger; to naive 'infected' thwarter; to someone who gets a grip on the situation, is developed flawlessly by Boyle in the opening half an hour or so. Jim's initial contact with an 'infected' sees him take an instinctive swipe at it – it's an instinctive trait that'll see him survive to the best of his ability. The study of Jim and his progression into a bigger and more brutal character is one of the film's many sequences of well observed substantial passages linked to character.28 Days Later knows how to stop and it knows how to slow down in order give its characters room to breath and time to absorb their situation. Rather than opt for Resident Evil's kinetic energy, during which no one in the audience ever really feels as if any of the characters are in any danger of any kind, the film is driven by characters and their decisions. One is a male Irish lead and the other is his black, of Carribbean descent, female equal. She is Selena (Harris), a tough; hard-bodied; machete wielding foil to Jim whom saves his life twice and is begged a third time on a flight of stairs to do so again. We don't figure Selena to have been like this prior to the apocalypse, so a great deal has already happened to get her to this point. She is only ever really 'put in her place' when encountering figures whom represent the anti-thesis of feminism; that is to say, archetypes who want her to serve as someone that is useful for merely cooking and reproducing, as the re-population of Britain begins again from a disturbingly primitive starting point.Regarding these types, those that drive the final third, their presence meekly calls to mind that somewhat interesting theory which I'm told inhabited James Cameron's 1986 film Aliens; that of the monsters being of one 'sort' of evil whereas certain human-beings representing another. In 28 Days Later, those that display levels of intellect or oppositional ideologies are shunned as the aforementioned ideas of a woman's ""rightful"" role in the world are played out as well – it all builds to a frightening climax. What with all this fascinating attention to character, role and predicament; Boyle remembers its genre cinema he's dealing with here and offers a number of scares and shocks anyway, giving the film a rounded sense. The film presents us with a familiar premise, but it's executed with such punch and such freshness that results in it just coming across as superb.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Intelligent Zombie-like Horror,"Usually, when a genre begins to spoof and make meta-comments about itself, it means that the genre is dying. This was the case with Westerns and musicals, but somehow, the meta-flick ""Scream"" and the spoof series ""Scary Movie"" seem to have revitalized the horror genre. The last few years have seen a number of fresh new angles on the horror archetypes, including ""The Others,"" ""The Ring"" and ""Dawn of the Dead."" The best of the new crop of re-energized horror/thrillers is definitely ""28 Days Later."" The premise of the film is that a bio-engineered virus turns regular humans into mindless, hungry killers, turning England into a post-apocalyptic war zone in the space of 28 days. During this time, Jim (Cillian Murphy, of ""Batman"") has been in a coma. He wakes up in this nightmare, and with the help of some fellow survivors tries to find a way to escape.The movie was criticized by ""Shaun of the Dead"" (also brilliant) for not being a true zombie movie: the zombie-like monsters are not dead, and they move with uncharacteristic speed. Still, the premise of the comatose hero was stolen gracefully in Robert Kirkman's ""Walking Dead"" comic, and in the forward to that comic, it says that what defines a good zombie story, more than anything, is the way human protagonists react to their situation-- when everything we have ever known, and ever wanted, becomes useless, how do we keep going?That is what makes this movie spectacular. Indeed, the zombies are not even the scariest villains-- the things that man does to man (and a little girl) in this movie are much more horrifying.

Zombies in England (with some cliches),"Good modern movie about zombie invasion of British islands (and beyond?)IMO:Not good: Too many cliches (English taxi for example, why not grab a faster Camry/626/Mondeo/Accord from next door?? - I mean - We are in the 90's I think?)Also some things (like relations between characters) were undeveloped.There were also too many unlogical issues (means of transportation, selection of available weapons) that really were out-of-place.Movie script is just too simple and dumb to keep things realistic sometimes. It drives the movie ok, but in the same time it puts the character(s) in a state of stupidity. With good reasoning (in THAT situation) - that should not happen.I would say this movie is still ok, but it has some drawbacks.(And really, I really mean REALLY - why all the fuss about the naked guy in the beginning??

Proof that British thrillers can really be great,"I can't understand most of the criticisms that have been made against 28 Days Later. This is not supposed to be a chronicle of how the world would deal with infectious disease. It is about how people - different people - would react to such a situation, given incomplete information and the complete breakdown (and disappearance) of society.The main character - the principle principal as it were - is Jim. 28 Days Later really centres around his movements and thoughts. He moves through the film in search of a father figure, eventually learning to take control of his own survival. If that premise sounds corny and familiar, its execution is anything but.As the film progresses, the characters' situation moves on and things get better for them. From the underground shop where Jim spends his first night, to Frank's fortified tower block and, later, the stately home outside Manchester where the film finishes, we see progressively better conditions.However, this sanctuary also serves as the greatest threat to the characters' survival. I won't give away any details, but Christopher Ecclestone's performance is utterly believable and the final plot twist provided (at least for me) a genuine surprise. Thus, the story loses neither pace nor focus at any point. All-in-all, it's a great story and a satisfying experience.28 Days Later may be magnificent, but its presentation on DVD is even better. Many films get a DVD release with a poor selection of making-of documentaries, unfunny footage of the cast messing around, pointless trailers and terrible deleted scenes.The technology is put to its best use when taken completely seriously. Danny Boyle and Alex Garland have put a huge amount of effort into the DVD release - providing an informative and engaging commentary of the film, including an alternative ending that was never even shot. No matter, though - a storyboard has been drawn up and the writer and director read from the script to fill in the rest of the movie. It is an intimate experience - almost as though you are sat in a room with your mates.The on-disc documentary - ""Pure Rage"" - sensibly avoids being sycophantic drivel. It's a genuinely interesting look at the production process as well as a crash-course in infectious disease - better than a lot of TV documentaries!Altogether, the film itself is superb, and the DVD is a valuable addition to anyone's collection - if you like to think from time to time, of course.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

"Apocalyptic, blood-chilling and absolutely great","The first thing I thought after seeing this movie was: I hope they never make an American remake of this movie! Now it is a very sober and powerful movie, but I'm convinced that if some Hollywood director lays his hands on it, this movie will be full of gore, explosions and other things that would make this movie a lot worse. From the beginning until the end this movie was able to fascinate me, thanks to the excellent music, the interesting way of filming, the nice acting, the very good story,...The movie starts with some environmental activists who have broken into a test lab where chimps are being used as guinea-pigs for all kinds of scientific experiments. What they don't know is that the apes have been infected by a virus that causes rage. They set one free and it immediately attacks one of it's liberators, contaminating her with the virus... 28 days later we meet Jim. Jim is a young bicycle courier in London who has been in a coma because of a car accident. When he wakes up from his coma, the hospital where he's being treated is empty, as is the entire city of London. At first he thinks there is no living soul left in the city, until he finds some people in an abandoned church... all infected by the virus (which he doesn't know yet of course). He gets out alive and meets some other non-infected people. Together they will try to survive and to find more uninfected people.""28 Days Later..."" is a very good movie, but I'm sure that it will not be loved by people who like zombie movies or other gory stuff. It has nothing to do with that and I'm very glad about that. I find zombie movies rather lame and stupid to be honest, but I definitely can't say the same about this movie. This one is absolutely great and underrated by many... It's full of suspense, it's blood-chilling, it has an apocalyptic feeling and is more than just another slasher/zombie/horror flick...

Danny Boyle delivers another classic!,"Title: 28 days laterDirector Danny BoyleStars: Cilliam Murphy, Noah Huntley, Brendan Gleeson, Megan BurnsReview:I finally got to see this film after much anticipation and was very pleased. The waiting was well worth the wait. The film is effectively creepy and scary and demonstrates that not a lot of cgi or a huge budget is needed to effectively scare the pants of an audience.The premise of the film is familiar since we've seen this sort of apocalyptic theme played out before in many films. This time around my hat goes down to Danny Boyle for creating a truly deserted and isolated place! It literally looks like no ones living in London! No one! Except maybe a few rabid raging zombies here and there. This idea of a desolated earth has been done before many times in films like George Romeros Dead Trilogy, Escape from New York, The Omega Man, Mad Max and The Quiet Earth, so the premise isn't necessarily something new, still it manages to impress. Empty streets, news papers with doomsday headlines of contagion spreading world wide, missing peoples pictures all over the city. All elements that enhance the feeling of desolation.The main character Jim, wakes up from a coma to find a desolated world. This is one of those films that continuously makes you ask yourself, what would I do if this were happening to me? To me that is really something, because it lets me know that I'm really into this film, and in the theater I was watching it in, the audience had the same reaction.This film takes a lot of inspiration from previous zombie films, there are moments here and their that will instantly remind you of Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead. I think its cool that this film takes inspiration in Romeros now classic zombie films. I'm fine with paying homage to other films, just as long as the filmmakers give it their own special touch, and Danny Boyle certainly did that.One of the most interesting factors from this film is the level of reality displayed. Never for a minute did I feel I was watching some popcorn/summer flick (not that I hate those) but rather, this film had a realistic tone that really augmented the horror scenes. The scenes that would make you jump out of your seat. Be on the look out, there are some genuine scares on this one! After you see how crazy and vicious the infected are you are genuinely concerned that one of those crazy zombies will pop out of nowhere an mess everything up for the survivors. In other words, you never feel safe.The zombie effects were different, not a lot o latex going on here, but trust me that is not a bad thing. These zombies look scary as hell...its all in those crazy red and yellow eyes. Its more about the ferociousness that they attack.The performances are great, and intense. I loved the chemistry between Jim and Selena. I cared for Frank and his daughter and wanted everything to work out OK for them! I really cared for these characters and didn't want anything to happen to them and that says something about a performance. I really admire Danny Boyle for making a truly horrifying zombie flick with such a limited budget. Yay for Danny Boyle, now go see 28 days later!Rating: 5 out of 5",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
28 days later,"28 days later is well good zombie based film with some strong performances and compailng story that is very well mixed with drama expects and featuring very good zombie chases and their infaction on people,in some moments story becames little cliched and does things we already saw in different films by that i mean military camp and their whole plot,also actress who potrayed little girl wasnt so good as the rest,i would put in the end 28 days later as solid but flawed story that had potential to be much more",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
not quite as good as I expected.,"Not as good as I thought it would be. It began well enough, but then deteriorated halfway through when they met up with the army platoon. The scenes thereafter were reminiscent of some old TV programme from the 70's. Not as much substance, not so much happening as there should have been, could have been slicker, more style. The acting by main characters was OK, the plot from around halfway through was not, afraid to say. Better the setting should have been kept in London for most of the film, more scope for greater scenes of suspense. Instead we saw the motley bunch of survivors legging it out of the capital ASAP. The film lost much of it's atmosphere after that.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Imitation of Life,"This film, about a dwindling band of normals seek to survive in a world infested with rage-infected zombies, is well-executed, but can't hold a candle to the real thing. Turn on U.S. talk radio sometime and you'll see what I mean.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
How a horror film should be done,"Danny Boyle has proved to be a director who can do almost any genre. He has done dark-comedy, crime, drugs, sci-fi and a children's film, and with 28 Days Later he shows he can do a horror/post-apocalyptic film with chilling consequences. This was also a big success for Fox Spotlight (the only good wing of Fox at the moment): with a $5 Million it made nearly $83 Million and was even more successful in the United States then it was in it's nation UK.28 Days after the release of the rage virus, Britain has become devastated. Main cities are deserted, the inflected, pretty much zombie like people, roam the streets. In London a bike courier Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up from a coma, and is shocked to find London is empty and has no knowledge of the event that has happened. He meets up with two other survivors, Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley) who tell him everything that happens. After being chased by inflected, Jim and Selena go to a tower block and meet up with Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his teenage daughter Hannah (Megan Burns). They hear an emergency broadcast from the army to go Manchester and the group quickly head-off. But it not just the inflected that the survivors have to worry about.Danny Boyle teamed up with Alex Garland, a successful novelist, to make a bleak, haunting film about the end of the world. They are strong scenes, like the deserted London, with only hints of what happens. They don't show the collapse of Britain, so leave it up to the audience's imagination. Boyle and Garland also focus on the most important factor in storytelling: character. There are interesting and believable, who have different views about live and the world. Selena is a pessimistic woman who has to be violence to survivor, Jim is a man who thrown into an extraordinary position, and the compelling father daughter relationship between Frank and Hannah. Major Henry West (Christopher Eccleston) and the army also show what man can do at it's worst. Danny Boyle shows his skill behind camera, using an effective hand-held camera, giving the film a more gritty, realistic felt, adding to the horror of the events. He shows he has a good sense for action, scares and more tender moments, allowing character interaction and revel who people really are. As a horror film it is very effective, even to people who don't like the genre. Boyle and Garland also add some moments of dark comedy to relax the film a tiny bit.They is also a good cast in the film. 28 Days Later brought Cillian Murphy and Naomie Harris to the public, and the two have stared in Batman Begins and the second and third Pirates films. But it was Brendan Gleeson and Christopher Eccleston who offered the experience the film needed, particularly Christopher Eccleston as a near mad army officer, like Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now.Garland and Boyle were also influenced by George A. Romero's Living Dead trilogy, with the collapse of society in Dawn of the Dead, the siege environment of Dawn and Night of the Living Dead, and the relationship between the army and civilians was like in Day of the Dead.An excellent horror film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
asthetically beautiful and entertaining,"this is the first movie i'm rating on imdb because i think it deserves enormous praise.  in my opinion as a student who studies media arts, it is the best movie to come out in the last 3 years at least.the movie, like any other, isn't without faults, but they are largely too insignificant to detract from this brilliant movie.most people know danny boyle is a highly regarded director, but he also lucked out in other areas with this movie.  the most important aspect of a work of art will always be the substance, the content.  28 days later is grounded in an exciting and emotional plot.  i thought it was also clever that the makers included 2 filmed endings and 1 storyboard ending.  this way, people that liked the movie and didn't like the way a certain ending sat with them, could watch another one.  if a viewer doesn't like the ending of a movie for some reason or another, it will often put a bad taste in their mouth when reflecting on the movie as a whole.  the plot is untraditional in its organization giving it more interest.  unlike most movies being made right now, the beginning is relatively slow and still, a nice change.  Viewer interpretation is in the forefront instead of concrete plot turns.  on being a horror movie:  this is not your typical horror movie.  there's relatively little gore, but it's scarier than many recent horror movies because of the combined effects of great camera work, unconventional movement and interesting settings.  one of my favorite things boyle does in his movies is he brings it down to a very human, tangible, realistic level.  at one point, jim has to shave without water, and viewers feel his pain and unhappiness.  boyle also seems to love juxtaposition. (examples are the christmas lights in the middle of disheveled london, the countryside where they sleep vs. the city, the red dresses inside the evil, dark house.)  i really like the symbolism used (""HELL...HELP"", white horses)--they hit you much harder than any other method can.  you get a very organic understanding and construction of the emotions of the characters. you'll be surprised how your feelings about jim change from the beginning from the movie to the end.  boyle knows when to follow the rules and when to break them.  one of the rules that is used because it WORKS is the struggle between good and evil.  you know it's being traditional as you watch certain parts of the movie, but you LIKE it.  certain parts closer to the end are conciously traditional (rain when jim struggles). i personally liked the ""damsel in distress"" feeling near the end of the movie.  that motif emotionally satisfies something in the average viewer.  in the end, most women want to be protected because they are loved.  most men like feeling of being needed and being the hero.  enough of that.  those are the highpoints of the plot, characters, story.the cast for this movie is perfect.  i had never heard of any of the actors before the movie, but they are far more talented than many run-of-the-mill actors.  boyle was smart to cast appealing looking, but not ""pretty"" people. this makes for a more realistic and engaging movie.almost everyone who watches this movie is astonished by the beautiful, powerful, interesting camera work.  you can look up the guy's name on the 28 days later website.  without those shots, this movie would not be the work of art many people consider it to be.  certain shots are incredibly lonely and cold, others are terrifying.  it's a visually exciting movie to watch.you have to see it to believe it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

A little late to the party,"Like probably many others I had heard about this movie before but given its age I never decided to actually watch it, now with the announcement of 28 years later, my interest was again captured.The industry is so saturated with the zombie genre and after the huge flop of the dragged out Walking Dead I have my fair share of these types of movies.Before watching 28 days later I was fully aware that I had to place the movie in the era it was lunched (2002) and that it had a big role in reviving the genre that to this day continues to have traction, so in that regard I recognize its value.Another really positive aspect is that it seems to deal really well with the human aspect, it captures with realism how some people would react under these extreme conditions and it showcases both the good and the ugly side of mankind (not just the gruesome and dark parts as most zombie films / TV shows).It also addresses the day to day tasks for survival, all in all it is a realistic approach which is surprisingly refreshing.Other than that I would say it's a fairly average movie, somehow predictable in several moments, even though the cast did an amazing job I feel that it didn't stand out in any department, although I do recognize that if I had watched it when it first premier my opinion might've been different.It's a good watch and it is of cultural significance in a way so it's a solid 7!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Real,"My favourite zombie rolling picture ever. And I'm not even a zombie fan. It feels very real. The acting. The scenery, the motorways of Manchester. The plot in which the military takes over. They could have included the police force, by the way. In the event of a zombie apocalypse, the police are very well organized, as well. Don't underestimate police for their stupidity and poor education. At the top of that organisation - in Manchester! - they are well organized. They would survive a zombie apocalypse and continue to harass zombies on the motorways. ""Zombie-Sir, can you open that car boot for me ?"" They'll go on with that attitude forever. Granted, police are not even watchable in a zombie apocalypse. Police are too horror for any movie. Anyway, that's what's not in the movie, for good measure. Police. In the movie, it's a small band of UK soldiers that made it. Eccleston plays a great baddie, here. And the great horror-tension tune in the background! I even downloaded that tune on i-tunes. Sometimes, in real life, people delve in good old memories when they reminisce about good old political systems, good old fast food restaurants, and good old holidays. However, if people start remembering meaningless or even bad occurrences as noteworthy, then their brains are rotting away. Prepare to let go of people who think pointless (or bad) memories were good. They'll cease to exist in front of your eyes, soon. Zombie 101.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Animals have no rights,"A extreme sense of unease runs throughout 28 days later, particularly in the terrific first act which sees hero Jim (the luckiest man ever to have been involved in a road accident)awake to find London totally deserted. Londoners especially will sense a distinct chill at this disturbing sequence, shot on eery DV which gives the entire movie (bar the epilogue)a rough disarming look, instead the comfortable crisp image of celluloid that we're all used to. I've never been convinced for the need to use DV up to this point, as 35mm film looks so good, but the overall effect works so well here that i've changed my mind. Rarely for this kind of movie, its not all running and gore; there's some particularly touching scenes, including the billboard in Picadilly Circus saying goodbye to lost or missing relatives (shades of ground zero) and Jim's discovery of his dead parents which leaves a distinct lump in the throat. Its in the middle section that the film lags, particularly on the journey to Manchester in which some character moments slow the pace down considerably, and the final third too closely resembles the Beach for my liking (you'll see what I mean) but at least Jim doesn't turn into a bad playstation game so its not all bad.

It is one step down from a very poor 80s American B movie.

I truly hope he is sat at home now regretting his involvement in such a poor piece of cinema. Don't do it again, Christopher.The only saving grace of this film is some the aesthetics of the camera work which uses a similar technique to battle scenes in Gladiator. Frames are removed in the filming process leading to a slightly jerky playback which offsets nicely against the rain falling.However, I also believe this is one of those films like Blair Which Project.

21st century's first zombie classic,"28 DAYS LATER (2003) *** 1/2 Cillian Murphy, Naomi Harris, Brendan Gleeson, Megan Burns, Christopher Eccleston, Noah Huntley. Filmmaker Danny Boyle plumbs the dank, spooky depths of an Apocalyptic thriller cum zombie horror film and delivers the goods with dark élan in this smart, sharply drawn cautionary (and so timely) parable about a lethal virus unleashed on London wiping out the general populace except for a young man (Murphy) who awakens from a coma after a month and realizing he is one of the few human sole survivors while rapidly moving, red-eyed bloodthirsty victims run rampant. Among the people he meets and teams up with to find a way out of the hell on earth is tough yet vulnerable Harris, father and daughter Gleeson and Burns and an unlikely savior in the form of a military officer (Eccleston). A hybrid of a George A. Romero genre thriller via Kubrickian morality tale with a turgid taste of black humor mix into a highly intoxicating cocktail of lurid emotionally fused melodrama. Excellent cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle gives the film a truly otherworldly look. A rare treat: horror movie and social fable intertwined.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Best Zombie/Horror/Sci-Fi film I've ever seen.,"I just saw ""28 Days Later"" for the first time on DVD and I say it's GREAT!!! Danny Boyle has really outdid himself by turning the genre on its head and bringing something new and fresh to audiences and the critics loved it since it's first release back in 2002; especially Ebert&Roeper. True, the plot may be Sci-Fi in nature but on the surface, it's more like a metaphor for all the violence and chaos raging throughout our ""normal"" society and is so plausible that its really horrifying and disturbing. The ""Rage"" virus captures that dark aspect of humanity and the characters personify it beautifully unlike any Zombie/Horror movie I've ever saw. Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins, Red Eye) is simply awesome as is Naomie Harris, Brendan Gleeson, and Christopher Eccleston, all who give terrific performances. I really liked Megan Burns as Frank's daughter who comes across as resourceful but also vulnerable and innocent. There are many scenes that were shocking and heartbreaking that can make you feel sad and bring you to tears; especially the post-apocalyptic, deserted scenes of London, once teeming with life but is now an empty shell of itself. The only problem I have is that the ending was a little too upbeat. Still, 28 Days Later is the best film of the genre that I ever saw. Watch it on a big-screen TV to get the full effect of this groundbreaking movie.Superbly awesome. Best I've ever seen in years.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Good apocalyptic horror,"A man wakes up in a London hospital, presumably from a coma and finds that he is eerily alone. The room he is in is empty, the building is empty, and what more is that the entire city appears to be empty. Before this scene, we get a hint that some horrible virus might have been released into the population and all doubts are soon confirmed as our hero is attacked by vicious, red-eyed, blood thirsty people dubbed 'the infected.'The movie is highly reminiscent of George Romero's 'Dead' trilogy as the characters try to come to grips with a seemingly hopeless situation. There are many terrific frightening moments and despite many limitations during production (budget, permits to shoot in places, etc...) the film is a solid fright-fest. There is a nice balance of eerie atmosphere and action, and, probably most significantly, the film is obviously not Hollywood fluff as there is no over-concentration on effects and gore. 8/10Rated R: graphic violence/gore and profanity",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Good film,"this film was ASWOME i mean come on it had lots of drama, and some scenes which scared you, but the choice of setting it in England, that was incredible, and i didn't even for see that Manchester would be set on fire, that was ANMAZING.the actors were right for their roles, but there were some things which had me going ""huh"", for example, the scene where he picks up all the money off the floor, what was the point but apart from that this film was very good, just wait for 28 months later to come out, that will be good.the fact that Jim kills the solider by pressing his thumbs into the soldiers eye, that was a good way of killing some one, but Jim is an idiot he let the infected solider get lose and infect the other soldiers. why did he do it",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"Solid ""Zombie"" Entry","28 DAYS LATER is not a ""zombie"" film per se, it is actually about people who become infected with a virus that makes them act zombie-like. The story centers around a small group of people who have managed to dodge the virus and look for safety in a city that is quickly becoming over-run with these ""things"". When the group finds that there is really no safe place in the city, they decide to make a mad dash for supplies and then to run for the country-side, hoping that there will be less of a virus-riddled population there. They then come upon a military installation who vow to protect them, but being that one of the group is the only female to be found, things quickly turn sour.Very little to complain about in 28 DAYS LATER. The one big problem I had is how the ""action"" sequences were filmed. Whenever any violence was shown on film, the camera would shake uncontrollably, and you could see no details of what was happening. This tends to annoy the sh!t out of me, because I like to see the graphic action up-close without the ""cut-aways"" or shaky camera tricks. I realize that it seems to be the trend nowdays to do weird camera tricks, but I still hate it. Not enough to ruin the film, but knocked it down a point in my book. Pretty original story, great performances - an all-around winner. Check this one out...8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
A total turkey,"This film is a total turkey -  the worst film I have seen in a long time. It is totally derivative and stems from the basic premise of ""The Day of the Triffids"" but totally lacks the logic and coherence that John Wyndham brought to his story.  I suppose that it could be used as an exercise for budding screenwriters to be shown how to avoid illogical plot lines and characterisations, but this really is a turkey of a movie.

Infectious Grit,"Credited with reviving the zombie genre, although it reuses the viral outbreak idea from the ""Resident Evil"" franchise, and some question whether it's a zombie movie at all--I guess because the infected are alive and fast or something, ""28 Days Later"" is more remarkable for its gritty style, as aided by the then-new technology of digital cameras, infecting the genre with a low-resolution, guerrilla filmmaking look akin to the exploitation cinema from which zombies were first reanimated on screen in George A. Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968).Consequently, the opening lab scene looks especially grotesque, including a rage-filled primate forced to watch similarly low-res, violent screen images, à la ""A Clockwork Orange"" (1971). This analogy of seeing with gritty, enraged infection is later recalled when an eye is contaminated. The protagonist waking up from a coma to discover a post-apocalyptic landscape would later be ripped-off by ""The Walking Dead"" franchise, although the shots of him wandering through a deserted London remain unmatched. It's also a stark contrast to the frenetic finale--alternate epilogues aside.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Blew me away,"I'm not sure I would classify 28 days later as a ""horror film"" as this implies that the main aim of the film is to frighten the viewer. Don't get me wrong, 28 days will certainly frighten you, however, it brings so much more to the table than that. It is a densely packed film which will grip you to the very end.The main story follows our lead protagonist - Cillian Murphy - waking up in a London hospital 28 days after the outbreak of a virus in the UK.This synopsis will sound familiar to many of you as one year later it would crop up again in the first issue of the Walking Dead graphic novels. I don't know who had this idea first, but nonetheless it doesn't change how effective this way is to open a post apocalyptic setting. It instantly allows the audience to form a close bond with the protagonist as both are new to this world, equally having to adapt to its dangers.This is executed flawlessly in 28 days. After waking from the hospital, Jim (Cillian Murphy) wanders through London presented in the form of a montage. The shots are primarily wide long-shots allowing the viewer to gauge how much destruction this virus has caused. The camera angles are usually distorted or unnatural, mirroring Jim's helplessness and realisation of his current situation.In fact the direction throughout the film is, for the most part, pretty stellar. The shots are creative and can easily be analysed. This grants 28 days an extra layer of artistic value, however - where other films fail - the artistic elements of 28 days do not disrupt from the natural flow of the story, making it a far more entertaining watch. I don't want to get into spoiler territory, but by far my favourite aspect of the direction was how it depicted the ""infected"" which was made even more successful by my favourite aspect of the entire film: The use of audio.28 day's diegetic and non-diegetic sound work together brilliantly to enhance the film's atmospheric qualities. The soundtrack/score is made up of wildly different pieces of music, however, they are all used at the perfect times to reflect the character's emotions and what the director wants you to feel. Equally, the diegetic sound, or even more importantly, lack of sound, acts as the engine that runs the film. I'm not going to spoil why, but the lack of audio in some scenes was perhaps the most frightening part for me.Apart from a couple places in the film where the sounds didn't seem quite right, or maybe a little over the top, sound as a whole is handled exceptionally well.So how do the characters stack up in relation to the other aspects of the film? In general, 28 days was performed very well, with the standout certainly being Cillian Murphy. He gives the protagonist flaws and personality which actually makes him feel like a real person, something which is very rare in ""zombie films"". Although, the only thing holding this film back in my eyes are some of the decisions the characters make. Of course, you have to take into account their situation and how scared they must be, however, at some points they acted so stupid it just distracted me.Overall, 28 Days Later is a thrilling, intense experience. A must watch for anyone looking to be frightened, or any film fans in general.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

28 times better then some Hollywood horror films,"Ah, zombie horror films. When I think about watching movies like the Dawn of the Dead or Resident Evil, I think of taking off my brain and leaving it in a big mason jar in the refrigerator for a few hours. I won't need them where I'm going. Let's face it. Zombie films aren't exactly fine cinema. But with 28 Days Later, that seemed to change.Our main character, Jim, wakes up in a hospital in London with no one in it. Matter of fact, when he walks outside he can't see anyone for miles. Coming out of a coma, he's a bit out of it, but soon encounters infected people that chase him, looking to eat him. Eventually he meets up with survivors from this outbreak, and learns that he should never come into contact with any fluid from an infected person (monster?), lest he too wind up like them.Rather then going towards the Dawn of the Dead type of zombie, it instead places a more real-feeling 'Rage' virus that is deadly. These people are still alive... but not really. They may as well be dead. They think only of anger, of killing and eating.And if Danny Boyle left it at that, it would be like any other Zombie movie. But he didn't. Like Trainspotting, he can take a very ordinary premise and make it franticly artistic. Feelings of despair and sadness, and the very real fear of dying are conveyed through our characters in good form, making them more believable.With a low budget, mostly unknown cast, and no special effects to speak of, 28 days successfully pulls off what could be one of the best zombie/biohazard virus type of horror film. It's well acted, and that's not supposed to happen in a movie like this.It becomes more relevant on the film's last half as to the message that is being sent: ""Who is more dangerous, the zombies, or the humans?"" A question brought up by Day of the Dead, though it is laid out much better here.Still, the movie may be a bit preachy for some, and those that do not like horror or violent images shouldn't even be anywhere near this sentence. But if you like your horror well brewed with a large portion of thought processes, then 28 Days Later won't disappoint.8 out of 10, 'cause IMDb won't let me put 8.5",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

"Its all the Rage, Not the Hype.","It truly bothers me that many viewers of this film do not find its contents frightening.  Or that they find elements of the plot and structure in similar styled movies which preceded it.An honest interpretation of this film destroys both of these false conceptions.  It wasn't formed seemlessly in a vacuum.  _28 Days Later..._ does indeed pay homage to the heroes of its genres whether they be the apocalyptic or more straight forward horror. This is not to say that it doesn't spin these themes around on their heads and give them us something provocatively new.Quite simply, _28 Days Later..._ takes one of the most numbingly frightening aspects of our contemporary culture, that of blind, irrational, and implacable hatred and lets it destroy the world or most of it.  Sure its an infection but lets be quick to the point here, there's a reason its called rage.  No longer are the 'zombies' the dead ghouls rising to plague the living.  No, these 'zombies' are very much alive, exaggeratedly so, ruthlessly fast and completely indiscriminate in their destruction.  The only thing they can actively discern apparently is who doesn't share their boundless blood-lust.  And all they want to do is pass it on.Ironically the dead are the only ones at peace and the living no longer need their help finding ways to die.This film does have its flaws (I did give it a 7 after all) but not detriments such as shameless unoriginality or lack of terror.  At times it can be a bit heavy-handed, delivering its morals with a listless dull thump, exactly the kind of strikes I remember _Night of the Living Dead_ zombies making, which makes them all the more unacceptable now that Boyle has decided to usurp such creatures.  The latter third of the film, the Manchester-third (without giving anything substantial away) is far from subtle and can be a bit tedious.  Thankfully the breath-taking opening and terrific middle portions will be remembered for what they are and payed homage to in the future in their own right.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

"Good cinematography, weak plot...","Although this movie is an interesting diversion for an hour or two, and a fairly good zombie flick, it's not a great movie.The movie starts out like any normal zombie movie, with the main character waking up in a completely abandoned city (think of how the first ""Resident Evil"" movie ends), meeting up with a small band of uninfected humans, and seeking shelter elsewhere. All this is well and good, though a bit slow -- London is completely empty, and the film demonstrates that abundantly through breathtaking wide-angle shots.Up until the point where the soldiers attempt to rape the female lead character and the young girl, everything was believable, though it left a few ""realistic"" concerns unaddressed (I'll address those later). Everything from that point on is just a bloodlust-filled rampage shot with grainy film (to good visual effect, but not terribly good in terms of plot), ending with a ""Sound of Music""-type perfect ending where a Finnish fighter jet notices the small group and signals for their rescue.Given that zombie movies are usually pretty cheesy, 28 Days Later was, for the most part, an enjoyable if somewhat bland movie. The last 30 minutes or so really ruined it, in my eyes, however.Being an individual who prepares for various emergencies (I live near a major earthquake fault in California, though I admit to being less-than-prepared for a full-out zombie invasion) and former US Army soldier, I had the following observations:1) With practically all of England infected, there is no facility for manufacturing ammunition, and certainly no importation of such. Why the British soldiers are so indiscriminate about full-auto fire when they believe the rest of the world is infected (and thus no hope of rescue) is beyond me. Shouldn't they be conserving their ammunition to make it last as long as possible?2) Why did it take 56 days for observation planes to arrive and start looking for survivors? While it's unlikely that other countries would immediately start sending in ground troops (for fear of infection), there's no reason why they shouldn't send observation planes to look at what's happening.3) Along the lines of #1, why did the British soldiers use their generator so much? They had a wood-burning boiler (where'd the water come from?), which made sense as they were in a wooded area and had plenty of fuel, but no resupply of gasoline or diesel. Even major internet data centers have only enough fuel for a week or two, certainly not 28 continuous nights, particularly so when they're hiding out in a captured mansion that doesn't have the existing infrastructure.4) It seems clear that zombies cannot climb sheer walls. Since the male lead character Jim had to scale a wall to flee the crazed soldiers, wouldn't it be fairly trivial to ensure that any breaches in the perimeter wall (gates, for example) were secured, and then clear all areas within the wall of zombies, thus being able to live in some degree of security? Additional reinforcement of the walls (perhaps with downward-pointing spikes, water-filled moats, or other barriers) could come later. Simply counting on all the zombies to come from one direction, crossing a minefield, and into your existing fields of fire (who's on duty all the time? There's not enough soldiers to stay awake 24 hours a day.) is rather silly from a tactical perspective.All right, enough nitpicking. As far as zombie movies go, this one's all right...but zombie movies aren't generally that great in the first place. Great visuals, good first 2/3rds of the film, terrible ending, and overall weak-to-moderate plot.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Danny Boyle's unnerving terror tale,"Danny Boyle's 28 Day Later is the best mindless human being film since Romero's zombie movies. It's an exceptional horror film that follows a handful of survivors after an incurable virus spreads throughout the UK.From the opening frantic scene that is quickly followed by the quiet empty deserted streets of London, you know your watching something different and fresh. Without detriment to the story there's lots of gore and bloodshed. However, there's also a lot of psychological terror happening and subtle character touches that make you feel for these people.Outstanding writing by Alex Garland and a pulsating chilling score John Murphy adds to 28's perfect tension, atmosphere and tone. The casting by Gail Stevens is faultless, it includes Cillian Murphy, Brendan Gleeson and Christopher Eccleston in their best roles to-date. This is director Danny Boyle's unnerving masterpiece.A perfect gritty horror, with a realistic scary premise. A must see.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Actually still great,"Despite being made in 2002 this movie is actually still great and is in my opinion better than most of the films being released right now. It isn't a 3 hour mind-bending Nolan movie but it isn't a dumb zombie survival horror endlessly filled with jumpscares, gore, and man-on-zombie action (although it obviously contains all of the above as one would expect from a zombie movie). This movie actually presents interesting themes, although the characters may be a bit simple they are as real as it gets. There are multiple thought provoking ideas scattered along the characters journey some were just hinted at some were expanded upon but not too much as the main focus was on the clean storyline and the characters that at points left me gripping the edge of my seat and sometimes the feels caught me off guard.

The Real Zombification Process!,"a well-acted, well directed, and well written scary movie. Director Danny Boyle keeps the audience off-balance. Nightmarish quick cuts and digital video give the look of the movie a gritty, hallucinatory immediacy. Boyle also makes brilliant use of the empty artifacts, from the deserted London streets to a once-magnificent Gosford Park-style country house, now occupied by military, who eat rotting food around the table once used for glittering parties. Each character gets just one defining quality (idealistic Jim, tough Selena, stout-hearted Frank, ingenue Hannah), but that just adds to the sense of urgency -- we don't have time to get to know them, just as they don't have time to get to know one another....Desolate and empty London streets. An upturned bus. A solitary man's echoing 'Hello?' sends pigeons fleeing. Simple imagery, but stunningly effective.Danny Boyle can't be typed as a director. This guy is all over the board. He has a great feel for horror though, making very sure that he knows what really is scary. There is some blood, no doubt, but this isn't a spoon-fed easy horror, but more of an unseen menace. Even when the ""Infected"" are (quite literally) in your face, the camera is shaky and quick cuts are used to break up what you see and blur comprehension. Boyle also knows when to rely on action and when to slow things down. He never seems to be in a hurry, and allows the audience to get to know the characters on their own. Nothing is ever over-explained here at all, and any small lapses are acceptable due to the focus.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Scary zombie film from England,"Zombies, when done correctly can scare like the best of monster movies. 28 Days Later is dark, the video quality is dubious (it was shot on digital video to curtail cost and provide a grittier look), and the subject matter is familiar. But the filmmakers counter these questionable qualities with solid performances, an intelligent script, and sure-handed direction. The result is a movie that kept me involved from start to finish. When Boyle wants to shock us, he has no trouble doing so. There's a little of George A. Romero (Night of the Living Dead) here. Several scenes in which the infected attack are genuinely creepy. One sequence in particular - in which Jim and Frank race to change a tire while a band of infected relentlessly approach - generates as much tension as any other 2003 motion picture. This is followed in short order by an effective character building sequence in which the protagonists enjoy a picnic while ruminating about what, if anything, the future might hold.

Horror with a twist,"Somehow, the feel of 28 days later exceeds most horror/zombie/infection movies. If such movies have flooded the box-office these last couple of years, 28 days later is, well, 'something else'.An infected monkey is freed by activists, not knowing this infection will soon spread among humans. And indeed, 28 days later, the majority of the English are infected zombie-like creatures. But somehow they past by Jim, who has been in the hospital these couple of weeks after an accident. When he wakes up, there's just empty hallways, empty streets... until he gets attacked by our growling zombies. He is then rescued by Selena and the two of them meet up with a dad and daughter, and the four of them try to make it to a, what they think, safe place.Then the movie turns more psychological, and I must say it's losing a bit of the grip it had me in during the first 45 minutes or so. Although it's still better than a lot of comparable movies in this genre, I was feeling the movie kinda ran out of steam.Danny Boyle tried something new, and it worked out for at least some parts, although ultimately (and not helped with the ending), I was expecting just a little bit more.6/10.PS Fantastic music by Godspeed You Black Emperor in the beginning with Jim wandering the streets.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
A reasonable movie about zombi,"The movie explores a post-apocalyptic vision. A group of people tries to survive the chaos caused by a worldwide epidemic of a type of rabies virus, and try to find a place to live under the threat of insatiable zombies.
Although many find this movie one of the best movies about zombies, I disagree. For me, it is just watchable and average, and the value they attach to it is overestimated. It's not scary at all. It's a bit like ""The Walking Dead"". The outcome of the film leaves much to be desired. There is a lack of logic and coherence in many passages due to defects in the script. The shallow performance of some of the characters does not give credibility to an apocalyptic situation of this magnitude. Some passages are dragged and monotonous. A possible highlight is a post-apocalyptic scenario in London, showing the city, streets and deserted avenues.

"More Action, Less Stupidity!","I'm the kind of person that likes a fair amount of horror but HATES the fact that in horror movies, besides blood and gore, is a great amount of human stupidity.

It shows the growth of Jim (Cillian Murphy) as he progresses from clueless to stupid to weak to strong to deadly. Also, unlike other horror movies, none of the characters are two dimensional cardboard cutouts. When someone dies you lose a character with a back-story that you the viewer has a certain amount of emotional investment in when they die. Another great aspect of this film is that it is very well written. For example, there's a scene where a bunch of army guys are sitting around a table philosophically discussing how they feel about the situation, and from that you can see how the characters react to events differently based on their point of view.

Almost perfection,"Here's an improved version of your article, maintaining the essence of your thoughts while refining the language and flow:28 Days Later is the best zombie movie I've ever seen. Its captivating story, perfect ending, and brilliant creativity in capturing the tense atmosphere of its world make it a standout in the genre. The tension when a zombie is closing in-the camera angles, the sudden cut-off of music-it's all just spectacularly crafted.So why do I rate it a 9 instead of a 10? There are a few reasons. First, it's worth noting the unique camera quality. The film was shot using a special type of camera-an SD recorder, if I recall correctly-which results in a lower resolution compared to most films. However, this isn't a flaw in my eyes. In fact, the gritty, unpolished quality enhances the movie, immersing the viewer further into its bleak, post-apocalyptic world. Although I found the quality slightly distracting at first, by the 20-minute mark, it felt entirely natural and even essential to the atmosphere.The real reason I dock one point is the inconsistent performances from some of the supporting characters. While Cillian Murphy delivers an incredible performance-this movie arguably launched his career-some of the other characters' portrayals felt underwhelming or vague at times. It's not enough to ruin the experience, but it's a small blemish on an otherwise phenomenal film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Jim soon meets Selena and Mark, two survivors who hide in a deserted shop. Jim begins to panic and after hearing that there is no government, he says a line which really makes you think:""What do you mean there's no government? There's always a government, they're in a bunker or a plane somewhere!""However we know he's wrong. This movie shows, in my opinion, that everyone is truly equal. The government and military aren't stronger than the average person. Unlike other movies the government doesn't escape from the virus in this one. Almost no one can.When the survivors meet Frank and his daughter Hannah. They then come up with a plan: to follow the directions a Major Henry West has given over the radio. As they arrive, they soon discover the daunting secret the nine soldiers keep.After seeing 28 Days Later, I began to think of most of the other zombie flicks I had seen before. Many rely on gory and sickening scenes with rotting flesh and lots of blood, as well as lots of screams and surprise moments. 28 Days Later doesn't rely on these facts. Unlike most zombie movies, there are some peaceful moments.The cinematography is excellent, with the abandoned streets and buildings. The characters also aren't two dimensional people who do the same thing over and over again. These people really seem like they have lost their families, they grow and develop, they express their feelings and they realise what they've got right and what they've got wrong.The horror scenes are well made with the infected people acting like what a real zombie would be like in my mind. They run, gurgle, scream and swing around their arms. I don't exactly like the traditional disheveled zombie which walks around and moans a lot. So this was a nice change of pace.One of my favourite scenes is the shopping scene. It's a beautiful happy part where the characters seem to forget their troubles as they take some the food. The music sets the scene perfectly. We even see them bond during their little spree. This part made me truly smile.All in all, this is a good movie for people who either a) are just starting to watch zombie flicks or b) just want to watch a great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Nothing special,"It alright i suppose. Just, alright. It gritty which is good and also chilling. Seeing London empty is chilling. In fact the first half of the film does enough to keep you hooked. The second half unfortunately is just plain daft. The atmosphere was the only thing that kept me watching. The church scene and the café sums up how spooky this film got.The acting was fine. Only negative is the child actor who it seems, was reading her lines by being printed on the wall behind the camera. The pacing was fine and the story of four uninfected humans trying to make it up north to a military camp was engaging. Thinking about, the whole film should of focused itself on there journey up to the camp rather than totally ruining it in the final act. And this leads me to the final act in which can be summed up by one word, terrible. You are forced to spend twenty minutes of your time by watching an infected thing run around a mansion like a fool. I love the fact that these zombies run at there prey head on rather than limping slowly but at times, especially the last twenty minutes, it made the whole film look daft.Is this film scary? i would say not. Is it fun to watch? At times, yes. Is it a modern day classic? No, for me, easily forgettable and with the last act being either a snooze fest or a barrels of laughs depending on your current mood, i wouldn't force myself to watch it again.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
It was ok,"Contemplating whether to give this movie a 6 or 7 out 10 and I've chosen 6 in the end, but it's definitely a high 6.

The action scenes were good and made the movie more thrilling, however at times it was a bit difficult to see what was happening because the scenes were so fast.

In the book the kids tried to reestablish society.

One Of The Best Zombie Movie Around,"What special about this movie was - it look more realistic than most zombie movie. Of-course zombies is not real, but this movie project it as "" what will actually happen to the survivors if the city is over run by the living-death.""It opens with breaking the code of zombie movie by telling the source of the virus, before concentrating on one-man wake up in the hospital 28 days later. The story is great and was told really well. The directing is awesome. And the acting is surprisingly good and though they are unknown actors (to me) I have no problem watching them.I've seen the alternative ending; it is not better than its actual ending.Though less action (compare to other zombie movie) and pretty slow pace  this movie did work out pretty well. Not to brag but this is one of the most interesting horror films I've seen in sometime.Recommendation: Excellent Zombie Film.

Terrific fallout of a dumb mistake,"If you are so smart to work with a deadly virus you at least have to think about a minimum security, but what the hell? If no then the life would continue as it was, so forget about the basic regulations and keep the infected specimen as they were just in the animal shop.What follows the major screw-up of a human existence is one of the most predictable but astonishing outcomes. Deserted streets of a big city, devoured carcasses of cars, empty buildings. That alone could drive me crazy. But what if you somehow missed the outbreak? Once again Cillian Murphy instantly catches your eye and ushers you into the doomed contaminated world having as little idea of what's happening as you.Danny Boyle has orchestrated an incredible show with only a few characters but on the massive scene. The acts interchange and throw you from hot to cold, at one moment you heart beats peacefully enjoying warm company and beauty of untouched nature and then it suddenly tunes into the rhythm of dozens of feet thumping the ground. That's when your hands get sweaty and through all those throat-tearing screams you can hear the death chasing your precious life.The change of the usual social ceremonies is shockingly cruel and incredibly convincing. Even the stranger valued more than anything, because you don't know whether it's a last human that you will ever see. But don't lose your vigilance, no matter the connection: friend or family, got infected - got killed.We all know that extreme situations pull the best of every person. Sometimes that best is the worst, so with all masks off you have to step on the path of survival. That's exactly what is shown in this grim installation of the world on the verge of extinction. And the way it's done is simply stunning: going from true friendship to basic human instincts ruling over the intellect.Looking over my shoulder I would say that the picture is a surprising example of a fascinating and thrilling science fiction mixed with horror, giving you both creeps and understanding that life worth living and even smallest things can bring you joy. Definitely worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
A low budget Digital Video masterpiece,"28 days later is a perfect example of what it takes to make a lowbudget film.  It has all the ingredients.  It also displays thetechnical aspect and wonder of digital video.A horror/science fiction film that combines an intriguing story withsome fantastic lighting.  The beauty of the movie lies mainly in it'scamera work.  The actors are strong and provide staying power.The digital quality is not perfect but due to being a ""horror"" film, it isdead on.  There are moments when the director capturescharacters through windows using reflections and lighting.  It isthis imagery that constantly parades throughout the movie andproves the capability of digital video.The film is very stylish and the story is complete with a wellstructured screenplay.  We have two endings; so pay attention. Wehave one where they make it and live happily ever after and wehave one where there is no escape against ""Rage"", the virus thathas a rabies type effect within 20 seconds. ""Hell"" I believe wasbriefly written out only to become a ""hello""There is gore and some sexual moments.  There is a fatalisticphilosophy about our future that comes up quite often but isrebuked by hope.The film can be an allegory on drugs if anything.  Crack and CrystalMeth. Heroin make people into zombies and make them feed offothers, not on each other.Four stars for their efforts.  The film holds attention and captivatesthe senses.

"A prententious, annoying and contrived ZOMBIE FILM!","I desperately wanted to leave this movie, but had gone to the theater with someone else in their car. Oops.The director's view of this film is very annoying. It's like ""lets have fun with the camera and see how many weird places we can film from, how much we can dolly the camera in every shot, tilt the camera to weird angles, and generally be pretentiously artsy and obtuse.""The horror aspect is amateurish. The last thing I expected was a zombie film, which is basically what this movie is all about. Silly zombies who are *inexplicably* not dead like nearly all the rest of British humanity, and how possess superhuman speed and agility, hiss a lot, and cough up volumes of blood. Ooohhh ... don't get hit by any blood or you'll be a zombie in ... 15 to 20 seconds ... Ooooohhhh ....This movie just didn't know what it wanted to be when it grew up. I expected something along the lines of 12 Monkeys, and got a bizarre zombie flick instead.I hold Roger Ebert and James Berardinelli responsible for tricking me with their 3/4 reviews. I should send each of them a bill for half of my $7.50. On their scale I'd give it a 1.5/4, or maybe a 2/4 if I was in a good mood. On my traditional 10 scale, a la IMDb, I give it a 4.

Brilliant modern horror film.,"28 Days Later is the first horror film in quite some time to successfully combine the hyper-realistic neo-celluloid capabilities of HD with the blood gushing glory of 70's grindhouse cinema. This is largely due to the always excellent and under-appreciated direction of Danny Boyle, and a cast that successfully balances their performances with the post-apocalyptic nightmare setting and monsters of the film.Cillian Murphy is very impressive in a lead role that is usually underused in most of the older zombie films in order to put the focus on the carnage. He, along with the supporting cast, add the emotion and character development needed to make the battles for survival that much more important to the audience. And for most part, Boyle delivers the goods on both ends, never letting up on the action in a ravaged English wasteland and delivering the blood in cringe-inducing splendor, all in high resolution.While the ending feels a bit rushed, I was completely enthralled throughout the entire film, largely because I sincerely cared for the characters and their lives.Definitely do not miss out on this modern horror masterwork.9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Not a typical zombie movie.,"Reviewers in the past have been to fast to discard this film as a zombie fest with the an added twist. I disagree with this theory as the creatures in this film are anything but zombies. A zombie is the walking undead whose soul purpose is to feast on human flesh. The 'rage' infected victims in '28days...' however are quite different. They are not living after death, rather they have been infected rage and become feral. They do not wish to eat people, their' attacks are purely rage driven.Something that sets '28 days...' apart from the stereotypical zombie film are the themes. Most zombie films spawn from testing gone wrong, or in some cases no explanation at all. '28 days' is the former, yet it leads into more issues than a regular zombie gore fest ever has before. Along with the unoriginal 'testing gone too far theme' comes a variety of other more thought provoking themes: what is the point of our existence? Is there a justification for war?Of course none of this would matter if the film was poorly made. However this is far from the case. The cinematography is something to be remembered. Every camera angle has been thought out to almost perfection and the empty London scenes are more eerie than any graveyard at night. The camera quality feels dirty too, like a bands first album. This is in no way a hindrance to the film, however, rather it adds entirely to the tone of the film.The acting here is all top notch with many great British actors involved. The best performance however is from Naomie Harris who you will believe has been killing the infected for 28days, if not longer!I wrote this review to let any sceptics know this film is worth your attention even if you are not a fan of the zombie or horror genres. It is a high point in modern British cinema and has more messages and ideas than the entire Romero back catalogue.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Two horror films for the price of one,"It's pretty much taken for granted that '28 Days Later' is a seminal British horror film. And it is. It helped revitalise the 'zombie genre' by making the undead into more than just - George Romero-style - 'shufflers.' It also started a trend in 'disaster movies' showing well-known locations (in this case London) eerily deserted.Everyman, Jim, wakes up from a coma to find a disease has spread through Britain turning everyone into zombies (or the 'infected' if we're being technical, as they're still alive). Now he must look for survivors and stay one step ahead of the psychotic enemy.You'll find not many people will say anything too negative about 28 Days Later. It's actually pretty good from beginning to end. However, there is a distinct change of tone midway through the film that does seem to grate on even the most die-hard of fans. It's like two horror films stuck together. The second could be completely independent to the first.However, both halves have their merits. The first half is creepy and sets the tone for a different type of ending that what's to come. The second half is more action-orientated and the infected (of which have been the bad guys during the first half) seem to take a back seat to human adversaries.But no matter how much the change annoys you, the acting is still fine, the sets terrifically creepy, the characters charming enough for us to care about their fates and the direction - naturally - slick, courtesy of Danny Boyle.All in all, this is a British classic horror that has spawned numerous inferior imitations. If you like your horror gritty, then this one is for you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"Excellent movie, a great film for its genre","""28 Days Later"" isn't your run of the mill movie. It utilizes the free, non-hollywoodized style of the independent European directors, and a really modern, end-of-the-world story that really makes you think, if not keeping you on the edge of your seat the entire time. Don't get me wrong, the entire movie isn't a fright fest, and, all in all, it really isn't that scary, but, in fact, very suspenseful instead. The movie does an excellent job of blending these suspenseful moments with much brighter, happier scenes, as well, creating a truly full experience, not a hollow, cheap-blockbuster bang. Not only is is a great full-experience movie, but this is amplified by the fact that it really does leave you thinking. I can't tell you what leaves you thinking, that would give too much away, but trust me, you'll ponder some of the more existential values and lines of the movie. In all honesty, this movie ranks with my all-time favorites, It's something I recommend to everyone. I give it a 9/10 rating, not a full 5, because it seems a little too gritty in parts, but, trust me, the 9 is well earned. Check it out!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
A Brilliant Entry at the Beginning of the 2000s Zombie Craze,"I just got finished watching 28 Days Later for the first time in a long time, seems to be a common theme for me, and forgot how impactful to the dawning of the next pop culture zombie renaissance. Now I know you are thinking, ""they are infected, not zombies,"" and you are right. But through the 2000s to now undead/infected all fall under the broad ""zombie"" umbrella.28 Days Later is a well shot film giving a low quality grainy feel to the film. I think that the cinematography approach that Boyle chose to use added to the films effect. It gives you as the viewer am immersive experience into this post apocalyptic world. The plot is pretty standard for a post apocalyptic adventure, you know survivors trying to survive where sometimes running into other survivors may be more fatal than run ins with the infected.The bottom line for me is I highly recommend 28 Days Later and suggest checking it out if you have not already done so. You won't be disappointed!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Definitely worth your money,"Danny Boyle hasn't done much since the incredible success of Trainspotting. Consider this a major make-up of lost time. I was skeptical about the use of the digital camera, but in the end, it proved to be a wonderful device for this particularly gritty and slightly off kilter zombie film. While the whole zombie genre has fallen on hard times, 28 Days Later presents the subgenre in a way that seems more modern and timely as opposed to some random curse or some explanation that doesn't make any real sense. And the emotions displayed in the movie are so realistic and carnal, one can't deny the idea of these type of actions taking place. What I especially liked about this film was the care and devotion the film makers went through to make this film look authentic and real. With the exception of one shot, the empty streets of London look as barren and hopeless as the continuation of mankind. Cillian Murphy was positively wicked in his role as Jim, and the rest of the cast was absolutely stellar in their simple (yet complex) character arcs. For those that love the horror genre, this is certainly one for the ages, one that will hopefully allow the horror genre to right itself.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Zombie Movie That Offers A Cure,"At the end of the world, what else is there when you have nothing else? Love.

Hackwork,"Wow, here's a real surprise...yet another film nowadays is nothing compared to the hype. ""Scariest film since ""The Exorcist?"" Listen people, here's the truth. ""28 Days Later"" is NOT scary in any way, shape or form. Not a bit whatsoever.The film is a huge letdown. It's a poor excuse for a zombie movie, ""end of the world"" movie, and all the other kinds of films it unsuccessfully apes. Now, you don't have to be original to make a good film. Even ""Star Wars"" has plenty of influences and many direct steals, as Lucas always freely admitted. So seeing ""28 Days Later"" rip off so many films is not the problem, it's just that it does it so poorly.The beginning of the film isn't ""amazing"" or anything special. It's a typically mainstream horror film beginning of a lame movie, that's all. From then on, the film drags and drags, until the last half hour, where a few interesting things actually begin to happen. Until then, it's a sleep-enducer.No, it isn't ""deep"" and it isn't ""profound."" it isn't ""intellectual"" and it isn't over anyone's head. It's simply dull.The script is horrible with countless holes and lapses of sense, and the actual filming and editing leaves a lot to be desired. Another reviewer pointed out that you really can't get scared because the editing is so poorly done when the zombies are around, you just simply don't get scared.Even a scene that started out decently, the tire-changing scene, turns into crap because when the zombies come around, the editing starts doing all the ""MTV video-style"" garbage. There's a real lot of that throughout the entire film. It doesn't add 'realism"" or make anyone scared. All it does is make the film look worse than it already is.There is one brief scene which is halfway decent, the ""mirror"" scene, and even that isn't scary at all, just a little suspenseful. But to be fair, a decent minute out of the film.It's not a matter of ""getting it"" or any crap like that. Plenty of films have done all the same things much, much better that ""28 Days Later"" strains so hard to do, and more profoundly even, if that's what you are looking for. ""28 Days Later"" is just simply a bad film that strains and tries WAAAY too hard.Really, this movie is just another reason why films on the whole are turning into garbage. The nicest thing I can say about this slop is that it is better than ""The Blair Witch Project,"" which was the biggest scam in movie history. (The scam being the cleverness in getting people in the theater to see that complete mess of a ""movie."" Can't anyone make a decent horror film anymore??",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Refreshing and original  (4/5),"It might be misleading to call it the most original zombie flick.The truth is, it's a zombie flick at heart, it's just a different kind of zombie flick. It plays homage to zombie movies, so a lot of the typical zombie flick formulas are still present.The typical zombie flick is all chessy gore, and it underlines a subplot of how the evil in human may be more horrifying than the man-eating zombies. Danny Boyle basically flip the typical zombie formula to the other side, it emphasizes on survival and human emotions in an apocalyptic scenario. The zombies are just a backdrop, it could've been any other apocalyptic scenario.Though he chose to use zombies as the backdrop, and he did well in updating the zombie formula. They run, they're strong, there's a reasonable explanation of where they came from. It's filmed with a lot of mockamentary realism. But ultimately, the movie is a human story, not a horror movie. It doesn't provoke fear as often as a typical horror movie. Though when it does, it does it well.And for the human story involved, it's simply about a helpless boy who grew to face the enemy for the ones he loved and becoming a survivalist, and the girl who was a survivalist and learned to love and enjoy life again. It's very simple yet well-balanced.The romance is very convincing, unlike most Hollywood romance that feel tacked on and by-default. When Jim tried to kiss Selena the first time, it was obvious that he did out of desperation, loneliness and helplessness, not true affection. Selena rejected obviously because she saw that, and it didn't matter if she had any feelings towards Jim, she would refuse any emotional attachment to anyone regardless. By the end of the movie, they got together for good reasons, and we are all understand and appreciate how they got there.The low points: It felt like an 80-min movie stretched out too long. It feels like there's only 2 acts. As a human story, 4 characters are not enough to explore the wide range of emotions and interactions that exist in an apocalyptic scenario.Shortcomings aside, the movie feels fresh and original. Being a big Danny Boyle fan (ever since ""Shallow Grave"", before the ""Trainspotting"" phenomenon), this movie is a redeeming attempt to the disaster that was ""the Beach"". And I think he won my heart once again.If you are a typical horror movie fan, this is not the flick for you. You'll probably be disappointed. It's more of an indie movie with a horror twist.4/5 stars",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"Good, but could have been better","when i first saw the trailer for the film, i was looking forward to see it. it was the kind of movie i have been waiting for. ""A virus that infected most of the population and only a few survivors trying to stay alive"". the good parts was that it was pretty gory and the infected ones had become more like apes, then the ordnairy zombie, which made then faster and more dangerous. the only sad thing was that it was too few scenes where the showed infected ones getting 'along' with humans, which had been replaced people talking to each other.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"A compelling, artful, very British take on the zombie genre","Having made his name with dark, grotesque comedies or dramas like Shallow Grave and Trainspotting, Danny Boyle didn't seem like an obvious choice for directing a zombie movie. But then again, appearances can be deceiving, and as it turns out, Boyle's gritty, low-budget take on the genre is one of the best horror films to have been produced in the last decade.In fact, the Z-word (as it's lovingly referred to in the hilarious Shaun of the Dead) is never used in the film, perhaps because the director prefers not to call his work a ""zombie film"". Instead, the undead are called ""infected"", as the whole story begins with a raid in a lab, where a very powerful virus is accidentally released. At this point, the scene fades to black, followed by the caption ""28 days later..."" (hence the title). And that's when the movie really kicks in: an average Brit named Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up in a deserted hospital and goes out in the street to look for help, only to find the whole of London completely abandoned (a truly unsettling sequence), safe for the infected, constantly running (maybe that's where Zack Snyder came up with the idea of fast zombies in the Dawn of the Dead remake) in search of human flesh. Having been saved by the disillusioned (and very tough) Selena (Naomie Harris), Jim decides to join her and her allies in an attempt to find a place where a peaceful life is still an option.At this point, the second part of the movie begins: Jim, Selena and the others run into a bunch of soldiers (led by Christopher Eccleston), who live completely isolated in a military zone while waiting for the situation to improve. At first, the survivors have nothing against staying there. Soon enough, though, they will realize that maybe it isn't the infected they should fear the most, as a dramatic battle for everyone's life starts to take shape...One of the main strengths of 28 Days Later... is Boyle's unpretentious, realistic approach: the hand-held cameras add to the eerie mood, particularly in the film's first half, giving us an otherworldly, but at the same time believable portrait of a dystopian, gloomy England. Also important is the attention to character: where most movies focus on the action scenes, the Trainspotting director is more interested in establishing plausible, affecting relationships between the people he's observing, and in that he is helped by a committed cast, especially Murphy and Harris (plus Brendan Gleeson in a brief, but exhilarating appearance). It is in fact largely thanks to the actors that Boyle manages to get away with a fairly conventional third act (heavily inspired by George Romero's Day of the Dead) and villains that would look stereotyped if played by lesser thespians.Overall it does have a few flaws, but 28 Days Later... is nonetheless a compelling film, and arguably the most interesting British contribution to the horror genre since The Wicker Man.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"Decent, but the sequel is better.","I can't say that this one is exactly... a classic. It's based on a ""Rage"" virus that if caught, inevitably causes mass anger and reanimation of following death- much like the ""T"" Virus of ""Resident Evil"". It's basically just another zombie film.However, it has some interesting twists. Instead of seeing the same old, same old, they twist it up a bit. The infected has involuntary muscle spasms, and will be running around like maniacs at the sight of ""prey"". There's no reasoning with these. There is no tying them up and teaching them meaning to life. Not here. And that's a slight beauty of it.I can most certainly say, though, that it's sequel, ""28 Weeks Later"" is far, far better. There's much more action, much more drama, and a lot more horror. One of those movies that gives you companionship with a warm-hearted character that later has something happen to them that causes complete change.

Okay but overrated,"28 Days Later has a very creepy first half which depends more on atmosphere than gore.  Now if only the second half were as good.

"Disjointed, cliched and forgettable","I first heard about this film via a film magazine, where I was treated to a free mini-dvd containing the first 10 minutes. After watching the entire film, i now know why they chose to entice us with the first 10 minutes - because that was basically the  high point of the entire film.The trouble with this film is the characterisation and script. At the point where the main characters pash (their names are?), i was cringing. The love story is so pathetic and predictable that I felt like flagging the rest of the film...'ok, i'm gonna want to pash someone in the middle of an apocalypse, when we risk attack from zombies at every corner'. They are in fact a neo Adam and Eve , which I felt was not explained properly.The actors suffer from a stupid, hackneyed script ...the characters are unbelieveable as traumatised individuals, for example, the young woman shouts - ""rise and shine sleepyhead"". The picnic and supermarket scenes were abolsutely appauling. So, like, the whole human race has only been wiped out by disease, but who cares, lets go whoop it up on supermarket trolleys to a rock soundtrack!  The picnic scene is very lame too - so, let's eat and we'll forget all the rubbish that has gone down with one bite of a hamburger!  And let's watch the horsies run in the fields and admire their freedom!   ggrrrr.... They also wander stupidly around, risking attack from zombies. My friends and I found ourselves yelling at the tv ...this film is indeed fustrating.  It implies, with the death of the little girl's father, that she was the only person who suffered the traumatising effects of family loss. In fact, the entire nation/world was supposedly wiped out. Um....However, what 28 days later benefits from is some stark, disturbing imagery. I felt especially queasy when there is a long shot of the church interior with bodies piled up in the rows.  The morning shots of an isolated London are especially praise-worthy.What I found most irritating however was the apparent lack of sympathy for human life (from the main characters... even though they  are tricked by the military personnel, they show no remorse for them when they are subsequently attacked by zombies). For example,  the girl pushes the head army officer out of the car into the mass of flesh eaters. This was unnessessary, and gratuitous. The film turns into some gratuitously plotted, girl-power plagued 'Survivor: apocalyptic London'.I have heard this film described as a fresh take on the zombie genre. Um...yes and no. The first half hour is the only reason why one should watch this film. Ultimately, the plot is disjointed and it feels like the second half is a different cinematic outing altogether.  I thought the acting was fine, but the writers didn't exactly give Cillian murphy etc etc much to work with.  Filmmakers never seem to learn that A. integrating a stupid romance into an action film will never work ; and B. when they treat us to the predictable demise of lesser characters, it is just plain dumb.I am glad this film is British, because it would have been absolute rubbish if it been American (no offence to any yankies reading this).  Oh, wait, it was a pile of cowpats anyway. I thought one interesting ideological question raised was that of the randy soldiers versus the imprisoned women. There are two females left alive, so the soldiers try to forcibly impregnate them to carry on the human race.  This idea should have been examined further.I've been pretty harsh, so if any of you out there liked this film, i say fair enough..this is just my opinion. Just don't do anything stupid like buy the dvd. You won't be watching it twice.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
They run now?,"1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die: #6Okay...I should address the elephant in the room. I've pulled another sneaky one on all of you because this isn't actually the sixth film on this list. That would be Two Or Three Things I Know About Her, which would pain me to do now because the title starts with a ""T"" not a ""2"". Yes I am that pedantic. I've made a note of it though, don't worry, I will get back to it once I hit the ""T"" section in about 25 years.And I'm not doing The 36th Chamber Of Shaolin either because much like with 1900, I could not find it anywhere with English subtitles and I utterly despise dubs. So like when I made an executive decision to talk about 1917 instead, I made another one here and thought of something I think you should see before you die that comes alphabetically between 2001 and the next film on this list. And thinking about films I'd seen that fit that criteria, it was either this or Roland Emmerich's 2012, so I'll hear no complaints thank you very much.Interestingly though, I barely remembered anything about this, only that I had seen it at some point. And that was awesome, because this was close to feeling like a new experience to me. Plus I feel quite justified in unofficially putting this on the list, because if there is one thing this film demonstrated to me in spades, it's just how much a good director can improve an...okay script. I mean think about it, yes this film might have invented the concept of a zombie that can move faster than the sperm of a 96 year old man, but those are a dime a dozen nowadays, and other than that and an anti-military slant that isn't very common in the subgenre, this really doesn't do anything new or interesting in either the story, structure, or the characters.And while that is still a problem to me, what it does do, and in absolute spades, is directing, cinematography, and editing. So much so that it makes it one of the most memorable zombie films I've ever seen. The choice to film the whole thing on a crappy digital camera was genius, because it gives everything such a rough and raw feel and makes the lighting much dimmer that blends perfectly with the overall tone and gives it a unique look too.Danny Boyle's directing is also absolutely stellar and he gives every scene something visually interesting. I for one, have never seen a film with so many damn dutch angles that manages to look completely natural and not make me feel seasick, and there's so many images burned into my mind after watching it. And you know what, the second scene of this film positively dunks all over The Quiet Earth for how much it can make you feel like the main character is truly alone. And that was a film that wanted you to believe he was the only person left on Earth, not just in London.And the editing...christ I love the choice of shooting quick shots from the zombies' perspectives and then cutting out any sound from them when they're about to attack. And how it's sensible enough to let a lot of music (oh, and the soundtrack bangs too) start off very subtle and build into a massive crescendo by the end of the scene. And...well basically, I could rattle on about this kind of thing all day, but I must be getting boring now.So I'll shake out a few more complaints and then be on my way: I think the kid's acting absolutely sucked. She can barely say a single line convincingly, which is especially noticeable when all the other actors are at the absolute top of their games throughout. There's also a tendency to have some really cheesy dialogue that often feels incredibly jarring to the horrible situation the characters find themselves in. Not saying you should never have some levity in darker films, but something about this just didn't sit right with me.Speaking of that, though, I find the entire opening scene pretty goofy. I don't know if this was the intention, but it seemed to me to be implying that the Rage virus was caused by the scientists showing the monkeys the news? Not that I'd blame them for getting incredibly angry at that, but even I've never spontaneously developed a blood-borne pathogen in that situation. And why the hell does the scientist say ""rage"" just to be dramatic even though the people holding him at gunpoint will have no idea what he's talking about?But none of that is really too important, especially not in such a strong directorial statement such as this. Even if it might not be doing anything too original story-wise, you ain't never seen anything like it directing-wise. It's pretty damn awesome and should be proudly stamped on this list officially, not just on my word.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
This is rare for me to say... but this may be one of the best horrors...,"Some people said ""This movie stinks!"" for one main reason: They all expected a gory bloodbath which lacked plot and characterization... which I'll admit, I can enjoy as well, heh heh heh. However, this film showed in the most realistic manner how the human race can destroy itself, and the results of our own ignorance. The ""rage virus"" goes to the theory about how formal communication separates us from the animals, and when certain characters are contaminated, they no longer have that and basically go by primal needs and emotions destroying everything and everyone, pulling the human race back down all the way below animal races. This is expressed best not through a sequence with the ""infected"", but ironically enough by a group of horses which now run free after the incidents, with an entire family of horses running alongside others across a grassy field. It is also shown just how easy it is for a loved one to be taken away from us by such a virus causes some emotional disturbances and a lot of ""what if?"" questions. It also shows how when we're put in a crisis of such high magnitude how even non-""infected"" can revert to primal instincts and once again, we destroy ourselves. This is one of the few horror flicks since those of ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""The Omega Man"" to have these social commentaries, and in the world we live in now with terrorist attacks, newer viruses, foreign wars, it makes you start to wonder... how much longer will something like this only be a movie?

London never looked better!,"Given that I'm a big fan of post-apocalyptic movies it wasn't much of a surprise to me that I liked this film. Sure, it's low-budget and the storyline is very low key - no planet saving heroics a la Reign of Fire here - but it still kept me entertained nonetheless.It's also far from original, though, and borrows quite heavily from Romero's ""Dead"" series of films. But considering we live in an era where they are remaking such untouchable classics as ""The Italian Job"" and ""Casablanca"" I don't think a bit of plagiarism goes amiss here and there.There are plot holes, but none so glaring as the aformentioned Reign of Fire's plot craters. But on the whole it's a solid piece of work and a worthy addition to the post-apocalypse genre. Although it's received some negative comments, I actually liked the DV nature of the production which gave the movie a grittier look to it.

Just did not work for me,"I'm astounded by all the positive comments for this film, because it just did not work for me. The characters were shallow, and predictable. The plot was lame, and relied on people doing unreasonable things in the circumstances just to move it alone. The jumpy, flashy, 'arty' film sequences, which are so effective in some films, were just irritating. Oh yes, and even in the context of a Zombie movie, the whole thing totally lacked any creditability. I mean, why for example, would the soldiers be on the verge of suicide because of the lack of women after just one month!Maybe it worked better on the big screen, but the region 2 DVD on my 32"" TV didn't work. It certainly wasn't helped by the excessive compression of the DVD - one of the worst I've seen; but I can't believe that even fixing that would have made that much difference.

Who said anything about zombies?,"I recently rented this on DVD. I had every intention of seeing it on the big screen, but that never happened. Anyways...A few years later and I decide to rent it - and I'm glad I did! In some ways this film scared me...not that it is a scary movie...but the reality I myself found from watching the film. After watching this I thought: ""Wow, that is a lot like AIDS!"" What do I mean...I know the filmmakers did not intend this for the film, but it was my own thought....Pure Rage reminded me of AIDS. Why? Well for starters, back in the day a lot of folks thought AIDS came from some guy having sex with a monkey from Africa (or a gorilla, or chimp, I can't remember)...anyways and people are infected if blood from an infected person gets into them. It attacks quickly and with regard. Much like AIDS. No cure is ever mentioned in the film - hinted towards- but no cure...Like AIDS! I know that may seem like a stretch...but think about it. It is a lot creepier to me to think of it in that context. I know that may seem preachy, but not my intentions. Merely stating an observation. The thought of comparing Pure Rage to AIDS made the film a lot scarier to me. We don't know all that we think we do about infectious diseases, which do not have cures.Off my soap box now...And who said anything about zombies? I have read a lot of people saying this sucks as a zombie film, or not enough zombies, etc. I did not think of this as a zombie flick.

Later to this one!,"`28 days later' is being hailed as the independent box office champ of the year. This is Bullocks! Bullocks! Bullocks!

However, I must say that the critics who have praised the apocalyptic   `28 Days Later' must go into rehab for at least 28 days (Yes! I know wrong 28 Days film again). This atrocious film is about a British man who discovers that the entire human civilization has been inflicted with a deadly plague is about the most horrific film I have seen in a long time. When I mean horrific I mean horrible! The ridicule continues when our main protagonist discovers that the inflicted humans now are killer zombies. I do not know if it took 28 seconds or 28 minutes before I discovered that `28 Days Later' will definitely fall in the list of one of the worst 28 films I have ever seen.

wait until it comes to second run,"This film is not that bad.  It is an interesting version of the biologic apocalypse theme.  It appears to be an indie film since the special effects and production values are not first rate.  There is only a bit of character development.  The film is shot very much too dark and most of the infected are barely visible.  The plot summary does not mention that the plague is only on the main British Isle and not worldwide.  An gruesome touch would have been for the flyovers to sterilize the whole island.  Better film versions of this theme would be TWELVE MONKEYS and RESIDENT EVIL.  Great short stories on this theme are by James Tiptree (Alice Sheldon), namely, THE SCREWFLY SOLUTION and THE LAST FLIGHT OF DR. AIN.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
an intelligent horror film,"I recently saw this film on video for the first time and was impressed by how intelligent and well-made it was. And scary to boot. The scenes where the main character wanders around London by himself, in the church where the infected priest comes after him, arms jerking and flailing, in the stairwell on the way to the top apartment, and in the tunnel when the tire was being changed on the car, each of these was terrifying in its own right. In some of the scenes, I was reminded of The Omega Man with Charlton Heston, another ""zombie"" film where the zombies didn't eat their victims, but used night-time to hunt down the non-zombies. Another scary film. I found myself watching 28 Days Later and thinking, this could happen. I mean, scientists could isolate a gene for aggression, rage, whatever, test it in animals, and what would happen if it escaped and crossed over into humans? I definitely thought about this film for days after I saw it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
An alternate view on zombie-movies,"28 Days Later is not your typical zombie-movie. This is so, because of 3 main reasons: It's not pointless - it actually has a good plot and a fabulous twist in the end; it's not built upon gore - it's very humanitarian; and, it's not a horror-movie - it's a movie with zombies in it.Besides good acting and a well-written script, 28 Days Later has an ability not many recent movies (at least not many recent zombie-movies) have - it really gets you involved. As crazy as it sounds, people can relate to this one!All this adds up to a well earned 8/10. It is one of the best Horror movies I've seen and to be frank, one of my favorites in general.

infection of society,"Danny Boyle has made a name for himself over the past twenty years with movies like ""Trainspotting"", ""Slumdog Millionaire"" and ""127 Hours"". But ""28 Days Later"" is also worth checking out. It's not a zombie movie in the general sense. Rather it's a look at what could happen to society if every person were allowed to unleash his/her deepest, darkest emotions. In this case, a rage-causing virus decimates the UK's population, leaving only a few people alive. While there is a lot of gore, the emphasis remains on the characters. Probably the thing that makes the movie especially unique is what we eventually find out about the troops.Boyle said that he took some inspiration from ""Day of the Triffids"". Watching the movie I could see the similarity. I also got the feeling that ""Contagion"" and ""World War Z"" took some inspiration from this movie. Most importantly, this is one movie that you have to see.

The End is Nigh...,"The first time I saw 28 Days Later was at a special on-campus screening when I was still in college. I remember watching one or two teaser trailers before leaving my cramped dorm room and thinking, ""Oh—another zombie movie."" It turns out my hasty assessment of Danny Boyle's gritty tale of horror and sociopolitical intrigue was grossly inaccurate, as this is so much more than just ""another zombie movie"" (and really, if you want to get technical, I wouldn't classify it as a zombie movie, because the overly-aggressive beings are, after all, not dead).The film opens with a group of animal rights activists breaking into a British research facility designed to study primates. Viewers are only given hazy clues as to why the sole lab technician in the building adamantly cautions the activists that they're making a huge mistake by releasing the animals (because ""they've been given an inhibitor"" that's somehow designed to presumably eradicate violent behavior in humans), but they fail to heed his warnings. When one of the freed chimps lunges at and bites an activist, she instantly becomes ill. Within seconds her eyes have turned red, and she's hissing, snarling, and vomiting blood. She's just been infected with the RAGE virus.Cut to—you guessed it—28 days later and our protagonist, Jim, is just waking up from a stay in the hospital. He was sideswiped by a car while delivering a package somewhere in London, and has been knocked out ever since. As he confusedly wanders out of the abandoned hospital, he discovers that there is nobody around—anywhere. One of the largest cities on earth is literally a ghost town. I don't want to ruin some of the great scares that are associated with the opening sequence(s), but rest assured that this movie is smart, well-acted (and directed), and utterly horrifying.28 Days Later had an almost immediate impact on me. Call it a heightened sense of paranoia in the wake of 9/11, but the idea of a biological attack incapacitating and ultimately killing millions of people is, at least in my mind, not all that far-fetched. Though it's certainly exaggerated here for the purposes of generating effective horror, this movie feels real. The attention paid to details it what gives it weight (as is the case with so many movies), and when we see Jim running in terror from a pack of aggressive ""infected"" who want nothing more than to spray blood on him and thus spread the virus, it's a chilling spectacle.And that, perhaps, is what makes 28 Days Later so effective. It all comes down to the very notion that should something like this happen, there would be absolutely no escape. There's no bargaining with those who are infected—they can no longer think for themselves; they're actions are involuntary, and are the direct result of being stimulated by bright lights or (and this is pure speculation because a clear explanation for their behavior is never given) the scent of those who are still uninfected.This taken on it's own would be enough to sustain an incredibly scary piece of horror cinema, but Danny Boyle decides to throw viewers a curve ball in the final act of the film. Like so many other horror classics, the term ""monster"" becomes loosely defined as people consistently demonstrate the seemingly innate ability to fend for themselves, no matter what. And, of course, the only way to beat fire is with fire. All of this sounds ambiguous I'm sure, but it'll make sense once you watch the movie, and it gives the conclusion of the film a certain subtext that might not have otherwise been present.The very name of the virus (RAGE) says something about Danny Boyle's intentions with making this film, and it clearly reveals something about Man; something that, as several of the characters assert, has been proved to be true time and again. 28 Days Later is scary enough as a no-escape exercise in aggressive ""zombie"" horror, but it's elevated to modern classic status by its unsettling observations concerning the true nature of humanity.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

A refreshing genre experience that often reminds you how much digital cinematography has improved.,"Though '28 Days Later... (2002)' uses digital cameras in an undeniably groundbreaking and trendsetting way, watching this 'zombie movie' (even in HD on its Blu-Ray transfer) really reminds you how far we've come in today's world of super-crisp, high-definition, 'film-competing' digital cinematography. However, this aesthetic is at least distinct, and it gives the flick this almost dirty underground vibe in keeping with its content. It's really the energetic way that Boyle uses the camera that makes the piece work as well as it does, though. The influence of the feature is undeniable and even reaches to its fast-moving fiends, as this is one of the first - and perhaps most mainstream - films that made use of the 'runner zombie'. Naturally, it's also one of the best uses of the concept. Its creatures are surprisingly, creepily versatile and viciously relentless; it isn't hard to see why they had such a big impact on the genre. The narrative itself is full of subtext and often pulls back to focus on the too often overlooked, eerily quiet aspects of a near-extinct population. Its lonely, melancholic segments and its slower, almost peaceful moments heighten the impact of its more tragic and viscerally dangerous ones. It also has an unexpected and gripping final act that makes some bold choices in terms of how it treats its hero. All of this makes for a refreshing genre experience. It does have some dated visuals and its story is a little uneven (the ending, for instance, is fairly lacklustre), but when John Murphy's phenomenal score kicks in, you know you're in for a good time. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

A very good movie,"I love zombies. Much more so than vamps or werewolves or possessed children vomiting pee soup.

The opening gives me more reasons to hate ""greenies"" and their naive ways. The protagonist shuffling through the streets of London in hospital digs and a bag of coke cans is just... eerie. Very well done. And the movie does a good job of showing the brutality of the ""undead"" - and later showing equal ""brutality"" with the ""living"" - primarily the rape and a rather gruesome ""live on live"" death where the protagnoist kills the rapist with thumbs in the eye sockets. The man's death scream is very authentic, and will send chills and bumps up and down your spine and flesh.Worth the price of admission or a rental, and the fact that its set in London adds to the movie's wonderful feel.8.5 of 10.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Has it's moments,"It's a film I've wanted to see for a long time - and last week I finally bought the DVD.The opening half hour really grabs you - petrol bombs in faces, bulging bloodshot eyes, staggering horrors and a desolate cityscape.From then on, they have a plot and a story and things, with plenty of dialogue, character development and eventually they explore good ideas based around the initial premise of this chilling end-of-the-world scenario.But it doesn't have buckets of gore and tons of mindless violence - which is the reason I wanted to see it in the first place.Apart from being erroneously acclaimed as a Zombie film, it's more your kind of ""survival in the face of apocalyptic adversity"" type of affair - with the ""infected"" being humans imbued with terrible uncontrollable rage replacing yer actual ""walking dead.""There are a few moments of gore and violence - and by and large they are done with style. There are also a few moments of excellent suspense, delivering genuinely hair-raising thrills.Basically, I mean to say that it is a cut above the typical horror fare that is served to the brain dead masses, and it delivers a fairly satisfying couple of hours entertainment.It has emotional impact too - again something that your average horror movie lacks - and screen time is spent developing ideas  rather than wringing scene upon scene out of a single concept.28 Days later - with it's digital video look, is very reminiscent of British TV's scifi of the 70's and early 80's - THE SURVIVORS - QUATERMASS - DAY OFTHE TRIFFIDS (not the dire movie) - possessing a  sinister sense of low-budget menace, clipped diction and impending doom.But it strikes me that 28 days is a bit of a quick turnaround to lose the entire UK - and not have anyone with a radio to pick up foreign broadcasts or satellite TV.....Ah well - a thought provoking, genuinely horrible at times, movie,  but not in the same league as Romero's mighty Zombie trilogy.Initial thoughts 6/10ahhh what the hell, ambitious UK films deserve a lot more support than big budget Hollywood garbage that's floating around at the moment -7/10 for effort.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
One of the most horrifying films to date,"When you wake up alone, you feel the sensation of fear. But when you step outside to find your city trashed with no one around except for flesh eating monsters. You begin to feel terror.""28 Days Later.."" is the story of Jim (Cillian Murphy). A man who wakes up from his coma 28 days after a terrible virus was accidentally unleashed on Great Britain. The virus is very contagious and just the slightest bit of infected blood can infect you and within 10 seconds after the blood is in your body, you lose control. The virus enhances rage and all the infected are in a permanent state of rage running at incredible speeds after anyone they see.Jim wakes up to find the streets of Britain deserted and it wasn't till he was chased down the streets by infected that he realized what had happened. Jim then meets Selena (Naomie Harris), a survivor who helps Jim to safety. Then, Jim and Selena come across Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his daughter, Hannah (Megan Burns). Frank says that he has been listening to his little radio constantly since the outbreak and reports of the virus having spread to Paris and NY. Frank also says he has heard broadcasted ads that the military are taking in all non-infected people and that meeting them at a certain point will ensure their safety.The rest of the film chronicles the group's travels to the military base and what happens there after. The film's main moral comes into perspective towards the end of the film where safety isn't always what you think and how in desperate situations like this, humans will do anything to satisfy themselves.Not very scary, but very horrific makes ""28 Days Later..."" one of the best horrifying films to date. With outstanding acting and twists and turns along the way. It is not a phony horror movie like ""The Ring"" or ""The Grudge"" but rather a full speed, high adrenaline horror film that always keeps you interested and never bores.

Better than mediocre zombie/disaster movie,"Horror movies. To be honest, the great majority of them are pretty darn bad. The zombie movie: conceived by George A. Romero with The Night of the Living Dead and followed by countless clones and sequels. Most of these, like most horror movies, are pretty bad. At least Romero's films had some measure of social commentary to balance out the general ridiculousness of the films.28 Days Later does nothing to restore my confidence in zombie movies or horror movies as a whole. A disease breaks out and turns people into rabid killing machines hell-bent on killing all living people (but not each other). The dialogue in the film doesn't do a whole lot to help it make too much more sense. Then a handful of survivors try to... well... survive.Sound familiar? Yep. The zombie movie genre is actually a cross-genre hybrid of the disaster movie and the horror movie. Lots of spooky scares from zombies popping up everywhere and general gotta-survive-at-the-end-of-the-world tenseness. And it's tense and there are plenty of spookies to keep the audience trembling in their seats. The film (after the weak introduction) starts off pretty well, showing a post-apocalyptic London.Unfortunately, the film falls victim to a pair of problems that are opposed to each other. First of all, the setup takes a long time. There's a lot of running around with little character development. Second, the last act of the film introduces the film's ""larger themes"" which really serve against itself. I think if the characters were better developed and the story more thoughtfully wrought, then it would've been fine, but it all just drops out of nowhere and is almost a second story in itself. A lot of the development that happens in the first two-thirds of the film gets annihilated in the last third because the film takes a very different turn. And in it all, it tries to make a statement about the nature of humanity, but it's really cliché and poorly drawn out. Oh yeah, like many other horror movies, there are shower scenes and quite a bit of basic nudity, courtesy of the male lead's character.The direction and the photography isn't bad, although it stumbles here and there. The acting ranges from just passable to mediocre. The movie has cute references to other films and sources, which is neat if you can get them. But in the end, this is a slightly-better-than-mediocre horror film. It's okay for a once-over but I can't really recommend it. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"Atmosphericly heart-pounding, but had flaws","As a big fan of zombie movies, I knew I had to go see this film in theaters. Sure, the infected are not zombies in the dead sense, but they are close enough.  Like most good zombie movies, the film relied on the characters' response to the zombies for a look at how people react than just making it a shoot-em-up movie.  We do care for the good characters and since they are always in harms way, it is tense to see them in danger.  One good guy dies early on in the film, so we know that there is not a guarantee that the people in the movie will live.The film starts out with a bang, then suddenly goes limp for about 10 minutes.  As the zombies pour in, the film finally advances in entertainment.  Danny Boyle's direction is very claustrophobic in this film. We cannot tell in a lot of shots of the zombies exactly how far away they are from the protagonists.  There is a scene in a tunnel where four people have to change a tire as we see the shadows and silhouettes of zombies closing in.  Then the film goes limp again with too much dream sequencing. Then it builds to a climax with some troops, the best part of the movie.While the film can terrify, there are some flaws that keep it from being a great work.First and foremost, DIGITAL VIDEO.  Why did Boyle decide to shoot the picture in this format?  This film looks horrible projected.  Anything in the background, even when it is the focus, is blurred.  The film would have been much better off shot on High Definition,  which can easily achieve the same color saturation as DV, is still easier to setup than a film camera, costs a little more but gives a clear, naturally 16x9 picture.The music, while I like the fact that it slowly builds, is annoying.  The creators let it build up too high so that it is deafening and you just want the damn music to end.  And then there are scenes without music (or where it builds too slowly) and it really needs it to keep it from being too slow.The MTV-style video editing during action scenes is atrocious.I won't give away the ending, but the film did seem to drone on at times where I thought ""THIS was the ending"" (or we were near it)... and then the movie kept going.  This is especially true about 3 minutes away from the REAL ending when a still frame is used and it goes to black at just the right moment that we think ""this is the end.""The film could have been great.  This effort by Boyle isn't anywhere near Trainspotting.  5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

New style of zombie horror,"In many ways this film lead the way for the new age of zombie horror. It's a film that takes its setting seriously and treats it with dignity and forethought. No longer are we supposed to fear zombies that shuffle ridiculously slowly through open fields where we can see them coming miles away. These zombies are vicious, fast and absolutely brutal in their search for human flesh. This idea had been seen before, but this film helped to popularize it and nowadays it's pretty much the norm for zombie flicks, which is great in my opinion as it increases the horror and makes the film more exciting, because you know that in physical confrontation with these zombies you'd almost surely lose.I also liked how they treat the human aspects of a zombie apocalypse. This was one of the first films of its kind where the true horror didn't come from the undead or the infected, as they are called, but rather from the other survivors. The zombies are a plague, a force of nature, in that they're utterly predictable and unable to reason or to be reasoned with. They're scary and to be avoided, but they're not malignant in a true sense of the word. Rather they're just driven by their instincts. Humans, on the other hand, are capable of true malignancy. They're capable of making the right choice, but they often get distracted by their urges and will make wrong decisions, quite often believing that they're justified in their behaviour. And that's what makes this film truly terrifying: watching as the last vestiges of civilizations bend, crack and crumble under impossible odds.So the basic story is good, it's very good. I also liked the main actors, who all felt like wholesome characters with their own motivations and urges. They also managed to grew and flourish throughout the story and none of them ended the story as the same as they had started, which is always a good sign. On the other hand, the antagonists felt rather hollow. They didn't grow all that much and we didn't learn anything worthwhile about them. They were just there to provide suspension and threat.The visual style of this film is something that divides opinions. It's rather bleak and other-worldly, with strong vibrant colours clashing with shades of brown, grey and black. It looks dirty and unpleasant, which fits the tone of the story, but is still somewhat hard to look at for prolonged periods of time. I didn't particularly care for it - except for few particular scenes - but I get its purpose. They way the film is shot also manages to save a lot. Lots of weird camera angles and clever settings make the film interesting to follow.In the end this is a zombie film that every fan of the genre should see. It's not the greatest in its genre by a long shot, but it has good character, suitably brutal action scenes and few storytelling tricks that have since become extremely popular, largely thanks to this film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"I'd rather think about it than watch it, for once...","Yeah, you read the summary right. I came out of this film almost laughing at how utterly bad it was. Only when I thought about it later did the odd subtlety of the piece occur to me - the fact that the virus in '28 days later' is called 'the rage', while 'le rage' is the French for 'rabies', which also saw Britain placed under 'quarantine'; the whole moral quandary of how we behave under duress, and indeed the question of man's place in the universe. These weren't bad ideas by any means, and some incredible films have been made on much much worse premises. So there you have it - '28 days later' has a fine director who knows how to capture true, gritty, desolation no less than he did years ago on Trainspotting; it has a decent enough idea of a plot; it has some whimsical black comedy, some poignant touches, and not a bad sense of drama; ultimately, it asks some cutting questions.So why did I come out of this film thinking it was so, so bad? Well, sad to say, it fails from the word go on some of the most basic counts. The acting is appalling, inexcusable, sub-soap-opera, diabolical, more zombified than the numerous extras, terrible, excruciating... a thesaurus would barely do justice to how absolutely dire the acting performances were. Usually in a dodgy piece of independent cinema, at least we come out thinking 'how's about so-and-so for a fine future talent' - well the same couldn't be said about '28 days'. The soldiers and both female leads are particularly poor. This is sad, since with some decent acting the film could have had some good things come out of it - it would certainly not have been removed to the level of farce it had been after the first twenty minutes by the panto-style fare it offered.Also alarming were Danny Boyle's shortcomings. Usually such a fine connoiseur of character-building, he happily resorts to feeble stereotypes - the boisterous, two-dimensional squaddies, the sinister tyrannical CO, the hardened feminist heroine. The only attempt at any sort of interesting characterisation lies in the hero's escapades towards the end, and in the tragic father-daughter relationship (though this becomes less impressive once you realise its complete dependence on 'Dusk Til Dawn'). All the characters suffer from severe lapses in rationality, not even explained by the exceptional circumstances they all find themselves in - in fact even less so: it simply doesn't make sense that in that sort of danger, 'Jim' would ever even consider going on his 'cheeseburger quest'.  Besides the poor characters, the dialogue is hardly glowing either - I always say that a reliable sign of a poor film is an excess use of the line 'let's get outta here'; in '28 days later', I counted dozens of utterances. What could have been some genuinely scary bits, too, were so long in coming that we yawned rather than jumped when 'frightened'. To be honest, I've woken up next to scarier things than this movie - despite being billed as a horror film, this doesn't even pretend to be; poor publicity there. Plus, check on the 'goofs' section of this webpage some time soon and doubtless someone who's thought about the film more than me will have given it the dressing-down it deserves in terms of plot holes. Also, the first half-hour left me stunned that we could still be subjected to such blatant product-placement in this enlightened day and age.Saddest of all, though, is that even the neat ideas the film does have are far from original. The concepts of growing brutality without law and order smack of 'Lord of the Flies'-cum-'Mad Max'; the messages that 1) animal testing labs are evil sadistic torture-pits, 2) man has come to the end of his time, and 3) man is such a horrible violent species by nature.... spare me, all of them, please. Thirty years ago this film would have been epoch-shattering, now it just smells dated, cliched, low-budget and half-hearted. Oh, and just in case you think I hadn't noticed, the whole first half of the film, with all its desolation, potential dread and tension, and all those deserted streets, isn't even original - just ask Charlton Heston.Basically, see this film if you're eager to see how your lottery money is being totally and utterly wasted, and don't mind a standard of acting performance which my little cousin's nativity play puts to shame. To be fair, I suppose you could see this film if long-exhausted ethical debates interest you, or if you never thought it was possible to stop all the traffic in a part of london for a few hours. DON'T watch it if you want your confidence in independent cinema given a boost - see Donnie Darko if that's what you're in to. Ultimately, though, if you really want to see something bleak, desolate, with a quirky post-apocalyptic edge after a deadly disease... watch Heston's 'Omega Man'. Give '28 days later' a miss - if it was a pet, it would have been put out of its misery a long time ago. Deader than the zombies. Five farts out of ten.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Awesome movie!,"I thought this movie was really good. It was unlike any scary movie I've ever seen. It REALLY made me think about how I would react to a situation like that.

I thought the accents were charming too :) I think it's interesting that all the commercials and previews I've seen for '28 Days Later' hardly say a word of what it is about. It intrigued me. My friends and I agreed though, that the last half of this movie proves how piggish men can be, how they really do need sex to survive, and how much power women can actually have over men. Want more proof? See 'Charlie's Angels 2'. Bottom line, this movie creeped me out and was awesomely awesome! Yay!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Absorbing,"While this is not a perfect film, I came away from the cinema feeling I had seen something new, worthwhile, thrilling and innovative.New in the sense it was not a traditional or modern zombie film, in fact it seems to borrow more from the Crazies and the Omega Man rather than Romero's classics (although there are some obvious homage to them as well)Worthwhile in the sense that the characters were developed more, especially in the first half of the film and the desolation and isolationist feel was well communicated.  Also the film took a brave leap in the second half that some have disliked.  Certainly I felt this was an interesting direction more reminisent of Apocalypse Now than the usual zombie flick and introduced new character elements with new messages.Innovative, certainly was the digital aspect of the film, the graininess working very well, contributing to the atmosphere and the realism. This was for mind the most impressive achievement.On the other side the infected are monsterous and the vision bleak. Recommended and throughly enjoyed. 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Interesting take on the zombie genre,"The re-invigoration of zombie horror in pop culture within the last decade can probably be attributed, in large part, to this movie. ""28 Days Later"" is not just blood and gore (although they do a good job of it), but it is a reflection on human society as a whole.The beginning is a bit slow-paced and slightly difficult to comprehend, but by the middle-end of the film, there is tons of fast-paced action. For those that like to ponder and analyze films, there are some interesting quotes in this movie:1) Major Henry West: ""This is what I've seen in the four weeks since infection. People killing people. Which is much what I saw in the four weeks before infection, and the four weeks before that, and before that, and as far back as I care to remember. People killing people. Which to my mind, puts us in a state of normality right now.""2) Selena: "" All the death. All the sh**. It doesn't really mean anything to Frank and Hannah because... Well, she's got a Dad and he's got his daughter. So, I was wrong when I said that staying alive is as good as it gets.""If you look past the seemingly pointless killing and blood-lust in this movie, there is a really deep side to this movie that tells us a lot about the good and bad sides of humanity. Just taking a closer look at Cillian Murphy's character, Jim, can exemplify this point. By the end of the film, we see his fight for survival and the protection of those close to him by giving into his own inherent violence. Similarly, Salena, whose only concern is for her own survival develops attachments to those around her and slowly starts to stop putting herself first.Excellent film - I would give it a higher rating than 7, but the slow beginning did throw me off a little bit. And, maybe because I'm watching in 2014, it's really not as scary as it's made out to be - but it does make you think.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Two Thirds of a Great Movie,"Unfortunately that two thirds in the first two thirds of the movie.  The film, which follows a band of people who have survived an outbreak which renders its victims into deranged killers, starts off superbly.  It also helps that the film was filmed with homemade cameras on a low budget.  That helped make the film much rawer and intense than if it used a more polished film.  The sense of isolation is also portrayed well, such as when the survivors are driving around through the empty streets of London, which is covered in trash and ruin.  Unfortunately, during the film's final act, the story falls apart and becomes excessively confusing and leaves us with no one to root for.  The twist towards the end also doesn't seem to have the reaction the filmmakers were expecting from us.  A shame that a bad ending happened to an otherwise good movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Mostly Works,"Danny Boyle's post-modern update of George Romero's `Night of the Living Dead' is more chilling than scary, but it's still a pretty effective apocalyptic nightmare--even though it never quite becomes the nightmare you want it to be. The film is filled with disturbing images of a devastated Britain that stay with you long after it's over. (A long shot of the town of Manchester seen going up in flames is particularly haunting.) Boyle has shot the film in digital video (the camerawork is by Anthony Dod Mantle) and it's a good choice, bringing a grainy immediacy to the narrative and allowing Boyle to indulge in some flashy but useful shock editing whenever zombies infected by a `rage' virus are onscreen. But the director and his screenwriter, Alex Garland, aren't content to let the concept of a country (and, presumably, a world) destroyed by infection be what the film is ultimately about and the second half changes direction, introducing a plot of lesser value about a crazed army major (well-played by Christopher Eccleston) whose goals for the future of mankind are intended to be as outrageous as the more gruesome elements of the story but are not, unfortunately, nearly as interesting. Still, much like `Trainspotting', Boyle brings his indefatigable energy to the proceedings and the intensity never flags even when the ideas get shuffled around. The young, eager-to-please cast includes Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris and Megan Burns and they're up to a difficult task.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"Original, but not my type of zombie movie.","28 Days Later might not be what you expect. Yeah, it's got a lot of action, but it's not your typical zombie movie. There aren't towns full of them, which is a change, for better or worse. In my opinion, it was an original change, but I wasn't all for it. It barely shows any gore or blood and when it does, it shows it for maybe 5 seconds. This was dissatisfying, but good for people who want to start out with a zombie movie that isn't guts flying all over the screen for 2 hours and still keeps an R rating. My favorite part about the movie was Cillian Murphy starred in it. He's not only a great actor, but one of my favorites. It sucks he's not in too much. He's an underrated actor just like Thomas Jane. What's really crazy about this movie is the zombies are moderately smart. They're full of energy and they usually know what to do. Also the military people turning on the main characters was a good choice, with the whole world ending and all, or whatever you want to think of it as.

"Worth Seeing, Not Worth Buying","Although on initial scenes it may just be another 'end of the world' film, it has a bit more substance to it than most. It scratches the surface of the 'what if' scenario, and was done in an interesting way. It provides one with a new way of viewing Zombies, a new way of viewing the survival scenario and what inhumanity exists when humanity fights to exist (as is seen even most initially in the film, and then culminates later on).Overall, the film is nothing special, and if you have a boring Sunday afternoon it would be a decent way to spend it. The action sequences are decent and the film makes you think (but only a little). The plot twists become mundane as the film progresses, and the ending is too reminiscent of other films filmed in the same vein.Overall, a respectable film, but nothing truly thrilling or to be greatly distinguished.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
One of Horror's most artistically ambitious films struggles to resolve itself,"The thinking man's zombie flick 28 Days Later, at it's best a frighteningly stylish British apocalypse, though at it's worst a technically overwrought stew of disjointed action and theme, nevertheless accomplishes elevating the horror genre to inspired new levels. With a strong first half, director Danny Boyle capitalizes on being an outsider to the zombie genre, shown by his evocative capturing of England through the eyes of one just waking up to this future-less nightmare(Cillian Murphy). Boyle takes this tried and true end-of-the-world scenario and instills a new artistic integrity into the carnage. Capturing the British landscape in such a desolate manner paid off in making this film something far more memorable then any plot specifics could. The eerie, vast stillness that serves as the film's superior first act will eventually become sidetracked by a confused, action-intensive finale, but during this awkward transition Boyle does not forget to maintain a psychological edge to parallel the progressive decay.Essentially split in two distinct movements, the action-packed showdown does not live up to the first half's sensually broadcast set design. Boyle and writing partner Alex Garland are to be commended for turning a horror found inside these enraged zombies unto ourselves for analysis, but in their overwrought hyper-kinetic style and morality logistics, manage to make the overall experience feel duller then the gorgeous setup would suggest.Whatever setbacks the cluttered second half demonstrate, it still only robs a uniquely great scary movie from being brilliant. How Boyle technically captures the infected (sped-up and annoyingly visceral) becomes more distracting then helpful, which a devolved but thematically viable climax attests to, but with the last lingering frame of haunting ambiguity, one remains in awe of this elevated fright-fest. Certainly one of the few zombie-type films that will ever grace a certain demographic's appreciation, and in that alone an instant triumph for Danny Boyle which continues to prove his adept range as a filmmaker.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"Good, but flawed!","""28 Days Later"" is an Ebola-virus type thriller, not too dissimilar to the UK TV mini-series ""CHIMERA"". Set in a post-apocalyptic, semi-futuristic time, we follow two survivors as they travel through London, to locate other people who may still be virus-free.The film is good, but flawed. The first third of the film is exceptional, without a doubt: the sheer terror and brutality of what happens when Man tries playing at God! It's graphic, uncompromising, and not-at-all for the squeamish or sensitive! If you think a horror movie won't make you jump, be prepared! The final third, is also very good. However, the middle third, and the ""ending"" are pretty terrible.The main problems, are down to the lack of empathy and feelings we have when the hero's meet-up with a gang of army officers, led by Brit-actor Christopher Eccleston. The men are essentially parodies of all the worst aspects of masculinity: the propensity for violence; the need to see women only as sexual objects; the laddishness. Yet, we don't really care if they make it out alive or not. Eccleston's performance is okay, but not his best, which is a real shame. His upper-class accent doesn't fit with the ""Squaddie"" character he portrays. A shame, especially when he is Manchester born and bred, and the Army squad are camped in Manchester.As for the ""ending"", it really negates the film as a whole, and I suspect that 20th Century Fox may have demanded or forced the creators of this movie to tack it on, despite their protests. Even if that isn't the case, the ending ruins everything you've just watched in the preceeding two hours.Ultimately, the virus isn't explained enough. We're told it was created, it exists, and has now escaped, but little else. As such, the nature of the way it can/cannot infect others, is left for audiences to accept unquestioningly.As a horror film, it's good. As a British horror film, it's a real shocker. But as a complete movie, it's let down by the saggy middle part. Some trimming of this section, would have made a really tight, and raw movie. Maybe, reducing the running time to 100 minutes, perhaps. Whilst by no means a long film, as it stands, some of you may well come-out of the auditorium, feeling a little frustrated at how the film pans out. A good attempt, but not the ""finest British horror film ever made"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Closing your eyes you can pick a better movie.,"I could go into detail and bore you with endless ramblings and a huge rant on what a disaster this movie was.  But let me sum up my feelings with what movie experience I have in seven words:  WORST MOVIE I HAVE SEEN TO DATE. Before that it was Midnight Mass, which even though it was a waste of time and I had to fast forward through it, may still have had 28 Days Later beat. What they both have in common is that is looks like a bunch of kids at your local university produced them.  And no, none of these kids was gifted by any means.  All I can say is thankfully I have shied away from the macabre genre for a while so that I am not abused by seeing a movie that might be worse than 28 Days Later.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Lack of originality,Let me first say that I wasn´t disappointed by this film as I had already read the comments of other users on this site before going to see it; so I knew what to expect. It seems to me however that most people posting here are getting hung up about plot irregularities and inconsistencies when for me the real problem with this movie was the total lack of originality. If you are a real fan of the genre then you will have seen this movie before in at least one other incarnation. It´s basically dawn of the dead (shopping spree in particular) mixed with elements plagiarised from the day of the Triffids (guy wakes up in hospital to find a deserted city)and other similar films. In short I thought the technical aspects of the movie were very good; I really enjoyed the cinematography but the plot needed something to differentiate it from other similar movies. Any comments??,6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
pretty decent,"This was a pretty decent recent horror movie. However, if British accents annoy you at all, just watch ""Dawn of the Dead"". It's probably a little better of a movie, and the actors have better teeth (just kidding)! No but really, this is a pretty decent movie. However, if you haven't seen this or ""Dawn of the Dead,"" rent the latter. You can actually understand the words of the movie (other than the zombie ramblings, which sound about the same with or without a British accent). The bottom line of this movie is that if you are an environmentalist, do not let experimental monkeys out of their cages!! They are not friendly like on ""Smokey and the Bandit!!"" Trust me, MT.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"Powerful, horrific, emphatic....all at the same time","This is a film that is macabre yet aching, violent yet emphatic. Take a would-be mediocre apocalyptic zombie flick, add some philosophy into it coupled with a haunting setting and atmosphere, and you have a great zombie flick that reminisces the 1940s' Dawn of the Dead.A team of human rights activists breaks into a lab and attempts to free a bunch of infected monkeys. The scientists warn that the monkeys are infected with 'Rage', a newly discovered virus which spreads by blood. Those who are infected with 'Rage' will develop a thirst to kill in 10 seconds, and once they have, they cannot be stopped without having to be killed. Unfortunately, the scientists' warnings fall on deaf ears and the monkeys are freed...and to put it to words, all hell breaks loose.28 days later, a guy named Jim (Murphy) wakes up in a hospital to find that the whole of London is desolate. He learns that the 'Rage' virus had spread throughout London and caused everyone to kill each other. So everyone is either dead or evacuated. He manages to catch up with some survivors and joins them in their fight to survive. Much to his dismay, he learns that now he cannot afford to trust anyone and in order to survive, friends, family and even allies have to be killed. The intensity of the situation and the will to survive has brought the worst out in everyone, and those who should really be their true allies might turn to be their real enemies (you will learn about this at the end of the movie).The factor that stands 28 Days Later out from most zombie flicks is the incorporation of a more visceral twist to the story; this movie asks questions that challenge the darker sides of human nature -- in a desperate situation such as this, will you let your emotions kick in? Have the survivors themselves become killing machines in their own right? Have we become like the 'infected' themselves -- slaying families, friends and allies with no mercy, all just in an attempt to make it out of a seemingly hopeless situation? The only law that applies to such a situation would be 'survival of the fittest', that is, the strong will survive and the weak will not. But is surviving really worth it, after shedding so much blood from those you used to know, love, care about? Are we, after all, the real killers?For the second part of this movie (which a lot of people deem as unnecessary and incredulous) I have to agree wholeheartedly with the reviewers who say that it is an important part of the story. Could the people who are supposed to be our true allies (the British soldiers) be after all, our true enemies? The answer might be a little bit psychological; it seems that they have been so emotionally shaken and traumatised by such a catastrophe that they become no longer humane. And in the end, is it better to live in such inhumane and horrific conditions, perhaps for the rest of their lives, or to die?Powerful, horrific, emphatic, compelling...all at the same time, 28 Days Later is a horror film like no other. A true masterpiece.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
could've been much better,"As I have mentioned before I like movies dealing with the end of the world kind of stories as well as scenes of empty and ravaged cities so I have been looking forward to seeing this one. Now after seeing the movie I have somewhat mixed feelings.It started out great. The shots from the deserted London were astounding. Alex Palmer walking along the cityfs streets, around the parliament, Piccadilly Circus under the sound of this techno was pretty cool. The zombies were also well crafted. In spite of the obvious holes in the story, the first two acts were interesting and enjoyable. Unfortunately, the last (third) half of the film was terrible. The imbecile-turned-Rambo idea was something beyond me. It significantly ruined the good beginning.Overall, taking into consideration the low budget with which this movie was shot, the great opening scenes and good soundtrack, I think that this movie is worth seeing. 10 for the beginning; overall, 7 stars out of 10.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
The Genre's Gold Standard,"If I were reviewing this title exclusively in the context of the zombie or post-apocalyptic genres, it would be an easy 10/10. 28 Days Later is the most believable, well produced, and well acted film in the genre by a mile (the closest competitor being 28 Weeks) which earns it an 8 in the larger scope of cinema in general.In my opinion, the entire zombie genre should model itself after the type of believable ""infection"" seen in 28 Days. The worst thing about this film is that it somewhat ruins the rest of the genre for the viewer. You are left wondering about glaring plot holes in the ""undead"" variant of zombie flick such as: how difficult could it really be to escape zombies doing 2 feet a minute or less? How does the infection spread if the undead simply eat their victims whole? If the brain is the only part of the body responsible for animation (as in Walking Dead, for example), how do the undead move about without functioning circulatory systems, etc.? 28 Days Later doesn't have any of these physiological plot holes nor does it suffer from a situation where the lead actors are more deadpan than the zombies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Probably the first zombie movie I seen and I liked it,"Yeah zombie movies has been done many times. But what makes this movie stand out is the atmosphere, the way it's directed and the feeling of being alone during the chaos. As the movie progresses you don't know what is going to happen next. This isn't just a zombie movie well it is, but it also has a bit of humanity in it as well. The origin of the zombie virus is irritating to watch but is also a plus in a way as well. This is also probably the first movie I seen with Cillian Murphy and the guy is a very good actor. And the way he portrays a character that is alone and doesn't know what is going on is very believable. So the premise is after the spread of a virus that turns people into zombies, Jim played by Cillian Murphy is alone and doesn't know what is going on in a abandoned London. But is in for a whole lot of zombie chaos and something more. Also what makes this movie more frightening is how turning into a zombie isn't a slow process in this, you turn from 10 to 20 seconds. The directing is done in a way that is grimy and gritty, which works for a movie like this.7.8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Very Impressive!,"I have to say that I should have watched it earlier, but when I saw Slumdog and Sunshine I knew I'll do it.And I wasn't disappointed at all.The chemistry between Boyle and Murphy is obvious and a very good one.Murphy is like a born Boyle-movie actor, (he does his job perfect in Sunshine too).The film follows the story of a courier, that wakes up in a hospital after an incident.He is rescued by two survivors from an army of infected people.Than they go north hoping for shelter and survival at a military road block near Manchester.The film is very well directed and the plot is full with action and intense moments.If you want to see a pop-up out of nowhere zombies movie, that is not the movie for you.But if you're going for something really good, for a intense action/thriller movie with good plot, acting and directing, that's the movie for you.I only have to say, that sometimes Boyle's movies get a little lost during the development.They have a little bit of everything-it has drama, romance and entertaining moments as well.But in this case this makes the movie even more likable.I didn't realized how fast I thought the movie ended-I haven't checked my watch at all.The movie is intense, entertaining, dramatic, thrilling and even epic-very impressive!Danny Boyle's best work in my opinion!8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Two good jump scenes and much more,"I got there late and had to sit three rows from the front, I hate that, and still had a good time. The problem with most scary movies is they are to well lit and the screams don't seem real or are covered up by loud music. The thing about this movie is it lets you feel scared. The characters say things that would be said and the screams feel like they are coming from terrified people. The early scenes give you the feeling of isolation and by the end you have run the full gambit of emotions. Some plot twists keep it from slipping down the same old zombie slasher road. You won't be disapointed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
