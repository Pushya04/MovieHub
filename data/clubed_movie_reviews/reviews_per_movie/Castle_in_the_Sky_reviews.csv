Steampunk Animation Pioneering...,"Bewitching wizardry and imagination that marauds through the sky to conjure an elegant and endearing testament of the great and the good that people can possess, while also demonstrating their more suspect characteristics, those that deserve to be banished to a citadel and fortressed far below ground. Another genuinely awe inspiring and prophetic piece of work from Hayao Miyazaki.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Haunting and brilliant!,"I first saw this film when I was about 8 years old on TV in the UK (where it was called ""Laupta: The Flying Island""). I absolutely loved it, and was heartbroken when it was repeated a while later and I missed it. I was enchanted by the story and characters, but most of all by the haunting and beautiful music. It would have been the original English dubbed version which I saw - sometimes erroneously referred to as the ""Streamline Dub"" (the dub was actually by Ghibli themselves and only distributed by Streamline) which is sadly unavailable except as part of a ridiculously expensive laser disc box-set.Unfortunately I feel that the release has been partly spoiled by Disney. The voice acting is OK but the dialogue doesn't have the same raw energy that the ""streamline"" dub or the original Japanese had, and I think James Van Der Beek sounds too old to play the lead. They have made some pointless alterations, such as changing the main character's name from ""Pazu"" to ""Patzu"", and added some dialogue. But worst of all I feel that they have ruined many scenes with intrusive music - the opening scene of the airships for example was originally silent but has been spoiled thanks to Disney's moronic requirement that there be music playing whenever anyone is not speaking, which I find annoying in many Disney films.This film still blows away most recent animated films, and I cannot recommend it highly enough. The plot is simple yet captivating and the film shows a flair which is sadly missing from most modern mass-market, homogenized animation.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Dreams,"It is said, that everyone at least once dreams of floating - flying. A weird feeling that can not be described. Now imagine having a movie about people living ""like that"". Studio Ghibli always is inventive and makes fantasies come through. This another one of those examples. Which as I have already stated at a different movie of them great, but also might make you sad, since they stopped production overall.An interesting concept and interesting characters collide - no pun intended. Animation is good and there is enough drama to keep you occupied for the total length of the movie. As with most if not all Ghibli movies, it is tough to really put this in a box and describe the story. But it is always better to experience yourself anyway.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
You need a 20 out of 10 ratings to rate Miyazaki's films,"Hayao Miyazaki has no equal when it comes to using hand-drawn animation as a form of storytelling, yet often he is being compared to Walt Disney.  That is just so unfair, because it becomes apparent by watching Miyazaki's films that he is the superior artist.  He really has a gift of thrilling both grownups and children, and Laputa is indeed one awesome ride.But where can I begin to describe a movie so magical and breathtaking! Miyazaki's works have never cease to amaze me.  Laputa is an adventure of a grand scale and I wonder how a film can be so packed with details and imagination.  Ask yourself this question: if you are a kid dreaming of an adventure so grand in scope and so magical, what would it be like?  The answer would be to strap yourself in some seat and watch Laputa, because it's truly a childhood fantasy come true.  Every minute of the movie is rich and engrossing ... from the train chase to the amazing air-flying sequences... and to the wonderous sight of the floating castle itself.  Not to mention the excellent score by Joe Hisaishi!  Everything you ever possibly want from an adventure movie is here.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A visually impressive and engaging adventure with a solid narrative, characters and voice-work  great fun","When the airship she is on is attacked, Sheeta tries to escape from her would-be captors but falls to her death through the clouds. Fortunately the enchanted and mysterious crystal she is wearing round her neck saves her and floats her to the ground where she is found by young Pazu, who is rushing to get back to his boss in the mine with food. Pazu takes her in and they become friends but quickly learn that the pirates after Sheeta have not given up their chase. Not only do the pair have to deal with the pirates but also the government, led by sinister agent Muska, have their own dark reasons for getting hold of Sheeta. Escaping Pazu's town together is only the start of their adventure together.Hard to believe that this film is twenty years old and yet looks as fresh and is as engaging as anything else you will see today. The sheer visual style and imagination is quite breath-taking and I could not quite believe that this was made by Miyazaki only 7 years after the vastly inferior (but still OK) Rupan sansei: Kariosutoro no shiro (or The Castle of Cagliostro as it was in the UK). As writer he has also done well to craft a story that is engaging and enjoyable. It struggles at times with the weight of coincidence needed to make the film move forward but the manner of delivery covers up these little problems by producing regular action and fun characters. The pace of the film is perfectly pitched and things move forward really well and I can't imagine an audience of children or adults will be bothered by the running time. The characters bring out nice relationships as well which adds value to the story but unfortunately points made late in the film about the environment and such are heavily made and clunky.The voice cast in the English dub are mostly very good. Sadly the weakest link is Paquin, she sounds unnatural and a little wooden too often. She probably isn't that weak but she is shown up by an engagingly fresh and natural delivery from Van Der Beek  not something I expected to be saying when I learnt he was doing the voice of Pazu. Just as good is Leachman's Dola  blessed with a good character in the first place, her voice is spot on despite sounding a little like Mrs Skinner on the Simpsons. Hamill takes the bad guy role well and shows his experience at animation even if he is a little hammy at the odd point. Everyone works well together and they deliver their characters well to support the narrative and they match the impressive visuals well.Overall this may not have the emotional depth of Spirited Away but it has strong characters and good relationships. These are grown within a engaging story told with pace and a good rate of action. Of course if none of this interests you then it is still worth seeing for Miyazaki's imagination and style, which is impressive and hard to believe that it is 20 years old this year.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Absolutely beautiful, and one of Studio Ghibli's most imaginative works","I cannot begin to describe how much I love this film. I love Studio Ghibli, and Castle in the Sky is one of my absolute favourites from them. It has a highly imaginative story for starters, every bit as imaginative as Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind's. Once again, the animation is magnificent, as is the haunting and poignant music score. The dialogue and pacing are fine too, and the characters are never devoid of their likability and are wonderfully voiced by a top notch voice cast. Castle in the Sky is an absolutely beautiful film, but it is also quite haunting helped enormously by the music and visuals. It is an amazing and I think unforgettable film, one of the best animes, perhaps even animated movies I have seen. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A delightful fantasy that will bring out the child in anyone,"Have you ever wished that you could escape your dull and stressful life at school or work and go on a magical adventure of your own, with one of your closest friends at your side, facing all sorts of dangers and villains, and unraveling the mystery of a lost civilization that's just waiting for someone to discover all its secrets? Even if you're not quite that much of a fantasy-lover, have you ever wished you could simply experience what it's like to be a kid again, and not have a care in the world, for just a couple of hours?This is exactly what Miyazaki's ""Castle in the Sky"" is all about. Pazu, a young but very brave and ambitious engineer, lives a rustic life in a mining town until one day, a girl named Sheeta falls down from the sky like an angel and takes him on a journey to a place far beyond the clouds, while all the while they have pirates and military units hot on their trail. Simply put, it is just the incredible adventure that every kid dreams of at one point or another, and I can't help but feel my worries melt away every time I see it.As it is one of Miyazaki's older works and takes much place in the everyday world, the film is not as visually spectacular or deep in its storyline as Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, or even Princess Mononoke. Still, I find it difficult to say that any of these films are superior over the other, because all three of those films are, at some point or another, mystical to the point of being enigmatic, if not perplexing, especially for the youngest of viewers.""Castle in the Sky"", on the other hand, doesn't try so much to be an allegory of any kind, and it's not a coming-of-age story either; it is instead quite possibly one of the best depictions of the inside of a child's mind I've ever seen. Not only is the artwork beautiful, but the use of perspective from the kids' eyes is just amazing; whether it's the panning up of the ""camera"" to see the enormous trees or clouds overhead, or the incredible sense of height from looking down at the ground or ocean while hundreds of feet in the air, I just can't help but FEEL like I'm there with Pazu and Sheeta, just a kid in another world, far far away from reality.Even the kids themselves don't have a complex relationship that suggests a need for hope like Ashitaka/San or Chihiro/Haku; Sheeta is Pazu's angel, having literally fallen into his life from the sky one day, the absolutely perfect person for him right from the very start. As the film progresses, more and more of their true adventurous childhood spirit comes out through their kind words and beautifully realistic facial expressions. Not only are they an adorable reminder of who I used to be, but their endearing friendship never lets up throughout the whole film, only growing stronger all the way to the last frame. For that reason, I've fallen in love with the two of them more than I have with any other Miyazaki couple.At the same time, ""Castle in the Sky"" is such an easily accessible film because no matter what kind of casual moviegoer you may be, you'll be sure to find your fix here. Mystery, action, drama, comedy, suspense, sci-fi, romance, even some western...it's all here, just about everything people go to the movies for (except maybe horror). This why I can easily recommend it as a first Miyazaki film; it's perfect for those who have no expectations from having already seen the incredible otherworldliness of some of his more recent works.Even the ending song of the film, when translated into English, conveys the sense of longing for the discovery of some kind of lost civilization, and some kind of soul-mate, that could not be found in our mundane lives. ""The reason I long for the many lights is that you are there in one of them...The earth spins, carrying you, carrying us both who'll surely meet."" Miyazaki has always provided poetic lyrics to make ending songs out of Joe Hiasashi's gorgeous scores, but this is the only one I've seen that's both a touching love song and an inspirational dream. I have found myself near tears just listening to it.""Castle in the Sky"" may not be Miyazaki's most developed, spectacular, or meaningful work, but it's absolutely perfect for what it really was meant to be: a true vision of childhood fantasy, and a wonderful escape from reality for any adults who wish they could have the same wonderful sense of imagination they had when they were just carefree little kids. Sit back, relax, and love it for what it is.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The one of greatest animated films of all time,"I first saw this film when I was about seven years old and was completely enchanted by it then but for years was unable to find out what the film was called. now i am twenty one and stumbled upon the film by accident about two weeks ago and bought a copy. although my memory of the film was a little hazy I was in no way disappointed by what I saw. the animation in this film is superb conjuring up an entire world that is so believable and so well animated that you are drawn in to the film by that alone. But this film also has a plot that will enchant and entertain adults and children alike. with a floating island, a mad general, a friendly pirate granny and a well constructed love story this film will not let you down I would recommend this film to any one.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not my favorite Miyazaki,"I was so excited about this film after reading all the glowing reviews, but it was a real disappointment. It's one of Miyazaki's earlier works, and that may explain it, but I just couldn't enjoy this film even though I really wanted to. I know it sounds funny to say, but it was simply just too ""cartoony"". The beginning of the film is pure magic and for the first 15 minutes or so, I was engrossed in the story and looking forward to the rest of the film. But soon after that, it degraded to almost Saturday-morning cartoon levels of predictability, relying on exaggerated and typical villains and supporting characters. If you liked this at all, you owe it to yourself to check out more of Miyazaki's films. He is a true artist and is capable of much better than this.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Best animated film I've ever seen,"I have seen just about all of Miyazaki's films, and they are all beautiful and captivating. But this one rises above the rest. This movie totally impressed me!I fell in love with Pazu and Sheeta, and their sweet, caring friendship. They were what made the movie for me. Of course, the animation is also superb and the music captures the feelings in the film perfectly. But the characters are the shining point in this movie: they are so well developed and full of personality.Now, let me clarify: I'm really talking about the Japanese version of the movie (with English subs). While the English dub is good (mostly), it simply pales in comparison to the original language version. The voices are better, the dialogue, everything. So I suggest seeing (and hearing) the movie the way it originally was.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the best again from Hayao Miyazaki...,"""Castle in the Sky"" is an animation movie in which we watch a young boy and a young girl with a magic crystal who are trying to protect themselves but also the crystal from pirates and foreign agents. They are also trying very hard to find a legendary floating castle something that is really difficult to succeed but they are not giving up their tries.In general I like animation movies and when I watch an animation movie which made by the master Hayao Miyazaki then I have to say that I loved it. The direction which made from Hayao Miyazaki of course was as I expected perfect and I also liked it very much. This movie I can compare it only with another movies that made by Hayao Miyazaki and these are: ""Spirited Away"", ""My Neighbor Totoro"" and of course ""Howl's Moving Castle"" in which I found some things in common.Lastly I have to say that ""Castle in the Sky"" is not a simple animation movie which you would think when you first see it, it's something extremely different than this. It's a lesson for life in general and at the same time especially for each person separately, this is something that makes this movie special. In this the most important reason was that this movie made by Hayao Miyazaki who has the gift to give us many things that we could not think before watching this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A great animated family adventure,"This is one of the best animated family films of all time. Moreover, virtually all of the serious rivals for this title came from the same creative mind of Hiyao Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli. Specifically, other great films include ""My Neighbor Totoro"" and ""Kikki's Delivery Service."" Spirited Away is quite good, but a bit too creepy for typical family fare - better for teenagers and adult. The one thing that sets ""Laputa: Castle in the Sky"" apart from other films by Miyazaki is that it is far more of a tension-filled adventure ride.Why is this film so good? Because it's a complete package: the animation is very well done, and the story is truly engaging and compelling.Most Japanese anime is imaginative, but decidedly dark or cynical or violent; and the animation itself is often jerky, stylized, and juvenile. None of these problems plague Castle in the Sky. It has imagination to burn, and the characters are well drawn, if slightly exaggerated versions of realistic people. (None of those trench-coat wearing posers) There is plenty of adventure, but not blood and gore. The animation is smooth, detailed, and cinematic ally composed - not a lot of flat shots. The backgrounds are wonderful.The voice acting in the dubbed English version is first rate, particularly the two leads, Pazo (James Van der Beek) and Sheeta (Anna Paquin). The sound engineering is great, too. Use your studio sound, if you've got it.One aspect that I particularly enjoyed is that much of the back story is left unexplained. Laputa was once inhabited, and is now abandoned. Why? We never know. We know as much as we need to know, and then we just have to accept the rest, which is easy to do because the invented world is so fully realized. Indeed, it is fair to say that the world is more fully realized than most of the minor characters, who are for the most part one-dimensional stock characters (e.g., gruff general, silly sidekick, kooky old miner, etc.) Highly recommended for people aged 6 to 60!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"One of my all time favorite movies, PERIOD.","This is one of my all time favorite movies, PERIOD. I can't think of another movie that combines so many nice movie qualities like this one does. This flick has it all: Action, Adventure, Science Fiction, Good vs. Bad and even some Romance (without even an innocent ""peck"" on the cheek between the Pazu and Sheeta). Maybe best of all, you don't have to be in Mensa to ""get it"" and enjoy the movie like you do with some of Miyazaki's other movies (I don't know about you, but I watch movies to take a break from thinking). This is just a flat-out enjoyable movie that everyone will like, so do yourself a favor and go buy it. The only sour note is the American Dubbing. I found Vander-Geek to be just plain annoying. But all is not lost, the original Japanese version is on the two-disc set and it rocks! Who cares if you can't understand spoken Japanese?

One of the best films made ever its that simple,"I first saw this back in the early 90s on UK TV, i did like it then but i missed the chance to tape it, many years passed but the film always stuck with me and i lost hope of seeing it TV again, the main thing that stuck with me was the end, the hole castle part really touched me, its easy to watch, has a great story, great music, the list goes on and on, its OK me saying how good it is but everyone will take there own best bits away with them once they have seen it, yes the animation is top notch and beautiful to watch, it does show its age in a very few parts but that has now become part of it beauty, i am so glad it has came out on DVD as it is one of my top 10 films of all time.

Jonathan Swift could have been proud,"Hayao Miyazaki is without a doubt, the best story teller of Japan.  His version of the Laputa Island episode in ""Gulliver's Travels"" by Jonathan Swift, transports us into this magical and technologically innovative world. All the characters fit into their roles.  The English version, is masterfully personified by Anna Paquin, James Van Der Beek, Cloris Leachman, and Mark Hamill among others.Great entertainment, mystery, drama and adventure are the trademarks of this masterpiece of anime by Miyazaki.  Worth to be watched by the whole family.",,Anonymous,Animation
Great movie; Paquin comes up lame,"This film is a great deal of fun, though the depth of thought behind it does not match that of others by the same director. My primary comment, though, is how very poor Anna Paquin was as the voice of Sheeta. Her accent varied from American to British to New Zealandic and back again with no apparent rhyme or reason. A very bizarre experience. She also seemed to play her character with little of the backbone that the lovely girl the movie portrays actually displayed. Otherwise, a must-see for Japanese animation fans! (And I hope everyone has already seen ""My Neighbor Totoro""! A truly great movie in every respect!)",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Probably Miyazaki's best, as it displays all his strengths","Listening to the soundtrack at the moment, the images come back with a vividness that makes my longing for a dry eye very strong (in order to be able to type this). I've seen it twice thus far, and I should be ashamed for having seen it *only* twice.I've seen all Miyazaki & Studio Ghibli films, and they are invariably nothing less than masterpieces (except maybe for Nausicaa which was, even in the non-cut up version too premature compared to the nec-plus-ultra manga). Still, their strength sometimes becomes their weakness, as they tend to get too naive/positive (Chihiro), or, with more nuance, a bit too explicit/moralist (Mononoke). At least, compared to for example the other Ghibli master Takahata (Grave of the Fireflies / Only Yesterday / Raccoon Wars). But not this one.In Laputa, Miyazaki pours all the brilliant storytelling that tellers of tales have gathered and perfected over the ages, combined with a bit of morale, but nicely interwoven with not only a completely transcendental atmosphere, but also with the humor and amusement of for example Totoro. Every single main character is perfectly portrayed with their doubts and fears and their qualities that help them overcome difficulties. The pacing is so perfect that I know of nothing except a black hole that would be able to exert such a gravitational pull on your whole being. The story sets out as an action flic with mysteries hinted at, but when the girl falls from the sky, unconscious, floating with the stone, and the main theme kicks in, you get a glimpse of the grand mystery you're about to uncover, but the story then settles and gradually, over a number of carefully selected scenes of action and serene beauty, builds to an unforgettable climax of melancholy, hope, beauty - like, following days of sombre gloom, finally seeing the horizon on a clear morning, knowing the path walked, seeing the distance ahead, but smiling at the mere fact of being able to catch a glimpse of it.It is so like an exploding white light in your skull that if by the time the credits start rolling you have kept your eyes dry and your mind numb, you should see a therapist.Despite the fact that technically-image-wise some more recent Miyazakis might be more overwhelming, this to me remains his undisputed masterpiece. If you take a fraction of a second to realise that this was made back in 1986, you can only come to the conclusion that Hayao Miyazaki is a genius like a star that appears only once every 200 years. This of course has been suggested before, but to me this is his only film that can, on its own, fully illustrate that simple fact. If you miss this during your lifetime, you'll die with a huge gap - which would be a pity, as the coffin costs the same.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Early masterpiece from Miyazaki,"Hayao Miyazaki's second feature film, and his first one to be widely acclaimed both commercially and critically (though his debut - Nausicaa AKA Warriors of the Wind is considered by many fans his best), 'Tenku no Shiro Rapyuta' AKA 'Castle in the Sky' may seem childish and simplistic when compared to his more recent masterpieces like 'Kiki's Delivery Service', 'Mononoke-hime' and 'Spirited Away', but in 1986 it was years ahead of its time and it was one of the milestones of modern anime. It's important to remember that 'Castle in the Sky' was made two years before the revolutionary 'Akira', and while it's not provocative and controversial like the aforementioned masterpiece, the lead characters are all mainly basic manga hero / heroine / villain type characters, and the story is quite predictable and obvious (at least in today's standards), Miyazaki's designs and animation work are of standards never seen before. While the story and humor are a bit silly and outdated at times, the movie is still very entertaining and very enjoyable - if not as breathtaking as 'Spirited Away'. And if you'll allow yourself to see the beauty of the frames themselves and ignore the low-budget coloring and animation and the identical twin faces - at this point Miyazaki is still faithful to his roots and to the agreed standards of Japanese cartooning - you'll see Miyazaki's genius shine through as well as it does on 'Spirited Away' and Mononoke. While 'Castle in the Sky', being a sci-fi adventure and very suitable for children, fits in more neatly with classic anime than anything else he had done since, his motifs and principles still show and play an important part. To say much more would be to ruin the movie, so I'll kindly shut up. Suffice to say that I'm giving it only nine stars because if I gave it ten I couldn't go any higher for 'Spirited Away' and 'Princess Mononoke'. And that would be a crime.As in most anime movies, I recommend watching the Japanese version with the English subtitles, even if you don't speak a word of Japanese - the English overdubs just don't tend to be very good, and in this case it's just horrendous. You might want to watch it in the English version once, though, just for the laughs, and for the star-filled cast (the English dub was only recorded following the success of 'Spirited Away', as it was for 'Kiki's Delivery Service') - Anna Paquin and James Van Der Beek (Yeah, the Dawson guy!) fill the lead roles, Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker from 'Star Wars', in case you don't know!) plays the villain, and other roles are filled by Andy Dick, Tres MacNeille (The Simpsons, Rugrats, Animaniacs...), Michael McShane (Friar Tuck from Kevin Costner's Robin Hood travesty) and Mandy Patinkin (Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya...) Good for a laugh, or a few laughs really. But watch the Japanese one first.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Miyazaki's finest fantasy epic,"Laputa: castle in the sky is the bomb. The message is as strong as his newer works and more pure, fantastic and flying pirates how could it be any better! The art is totally amazing and the soundtrack, which is reused many times after this, (im not sure if this was the first time i heard it) and evokes in me the most emotional sentimental response of any movie soundtrack. Sheeta, the female lead in this movie is totally awesome and the boy, Pazu is also a great role-model--he lives on his own! The plot is classic Miyazaki. I won't give it away, but the end is really great. I rank this as one of Miyazaki's three best with Nausicaa and Spirited Away. Also you may want to check out Howl's Moving Castle when it comes out (sometime next year i hope) If you like Miyazaki check this one out as it readily available in the USA.

Sky Pirates,"A young boy and a girl with a magic crystal must race against pirates and foreign agents in a search for a legendary floating castle.The general plot of the film is pretty interesting, with its sky themes and pirates. Was this an influence on Disney's ""Tailspin""? The voice actors are all quite good, though it is curious that somehow Andy Dick was hired.Composer Joe Hisaishi was commissioned to rework and extend his original synthesizer-composed 39-minute soundtrack into a 90-minute piece for symphony orchestra in an effort to make the film more accessible to US audiences who are accustomed to a more substantial musical accompaniment. Newer sound effects were included as well, presumably to bring the film up to theatrical standards.

Absolutely *not* my favorite anime,"This movie is absolutely far from being my favorite. Actually, it reaches the opposite end of the scale.Why? (personal opinion) Lacking the depth of Mononoke-Hime and the beauty and fantasy of Chihiro (Spirited Away), if falls short in most regards. Maybe I am spoiled by the later movies, but the story was flat, predictable and straight forward. The graphics were sometimes really nice, but neither overwhelming nor stunning. For me the story failed to unfold, and I never felt connected to any of the protagonists. Sitting in the cinema I was (strangely) reminded of Star Wars 1. A lot of nice scenes and random events, but badly connected and hardly surprising at any given time. Also, the movie contains various elements of slapstick, fighting (with some force/brutality - plenty people get killed (though not directly visible)) and Jules-Verne-style tech-fantasy. But it never excels in any of those elements, they come rather ""cheap"" and mixing them wildly does not make any movie any better.For kids it might be an okay movie, but it lacks the ""cuteness""-factor (except for some seconds with (fantasy) animals). For parents (or adults in general) it might become boring.This is my heavily biased subjective opinion - maybe without a 7.9 here on IMDb I would have watched it with lower expectations, but I guess I still would have been disappointed big time.....",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Release it Disney! The dub is very good...,"By now you've probably heard a bit about the new Disney dub of Miyazaki's classic film, Laputa: Castle In The Sky. During late summer of 1998, Disney released ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" on video which included a preview of the Laputa dub saying it was due out in ""1999"". It's obviously way past that year now, but the dub has been finally completed. And it's not ""Laputa: Castle In The Sky"", just ""Castle In The Sky"" for the dub, since Laputa is not such a nice word in Spanish (even though they use the word Laputa many times throughout the dub). You've also probably heard that world renowned composer, Joe Hisaishi, who scored the movie originally, went back to rescore the excellent music with new arrangements. Laputa came out before My Neighbor Totoro and after Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, which began Studio Ghibli and it's long string of hits. And in my opinion, I think it's one of Miyazaki's best films with a powerful lesson tuckered inside this two hour and four minute gem. Laputa: Castle in the Sky is a film for all ages and I urge everyone to see it.For those unfamiliar with Castle in the Sky's story, it begins right at the start and doesn't stop for the next two hours. The storytelling is so flawless and masterfully crafted, you see Miyazaki's true vision. And believe me, it's one fantastic one. The film begins with Sheeta, a girl with one helluva past as she is being held captive by the government on an airship. Sheeta holds the key to Laputa, the castle in the sky and a long lost civilization. The key to Laputa is a sacred pendant she has which is sought by many, namely the government, the military and the air pirate group, the Dola gang (who Sheeta and Pazu later befriend). Soon, the pirates attack the ship and she escapes during the raid. She falls a few thousand feet, but the fall is soft and thanks to her pendant. As she floats down from the sky, Pazu, an orphan boy who survives by working in the mines, sees Sheeta and catches her. The two become fast friends, but thanks to her pendant, the two get caught up in one huge thrill ride as the Dola gang and government try to capture Sheeta. One action sequence after another, we learn all of the character's motives and identities as we build to the emotional and action packed climax which will surely please all with it's fantastic animation and wonderful dialogue. Plus somewhat twisty surprise. I think this film is simply remarkable and does hold for the two hour and four minute run time. The story is wonderful, as we peak into Hayao Miyazaki's animation which has no limits. The setting of the film is a combo of many time periods. It does seem to take place at the end of the 1800s, but it is some alternante universe which has advanced technology and weapons. Laputa is also surprisingly a funny film. The film has tons of hilarious moments, almost equal to the drama and action the film holds. I think the funniest part is a fight scene where Pazu's boss faces off against a pirate, and soon after a riot breaks out. It's funny as we see the men compare their strength and the music fits right in with it perfectly.Now let's talk about how the dub rates. An excellent cast give some great performances to bring these characters to life. Teen heartthrob James Van Der Beek plays the hero Pazu, who has a much more mature voice then in the Japanese version, where in the original he sounded more childlike. Either way, I think his voice is a nice fit with Pazu. Anna Paquin, the young Oscar winner from ""The Piano"", plays Sheeta. This is also a nice performance, but the voice is a bit uneven, she doesn't stay true to one accent. At times she sounds as American as apple pie, but at other times she sounds like someone from New Zealand. The performance I most enjoyed however was of Coris Leachman, who played Mama Dola. Not only is this an excellent performance, but the voice and emotion she gives the character really brings it to life. If there was ever a live action Laputa movie (G-d forbid), she would be the one to play her, you can just imagine her in the role (well, somewhat). Luke Skywalker himself, Mark Hamill is Muska, and this is another top rate Hamill performance. You may be familiar with Hamill from a long line of voice work after he did the original Star Wars movies, but he renders Muska to full evil. His voice sounds like his regular voice and mix of the Joker, who he played for many episodes on the animated Batman series. Rounding out the cast is voice character actor Jim Cummings, who does a great, gruff job as the general and Andy Dick and Mandy Patakin as members of the Dola gang.Now let me talk about what really makes this dub special, Joe Hisaishi's newly arranged music! For those who have never heard of him, Mr. Hisaishi does the music and like all of Miyazaki's films, the music is very memorable. Each of his scores has it's own personas which fits the particular film perfectly. Now, these new arrangements he has done are more ""American like"", which I think was the goal of the new recordings. Don't worry, the classic tunes of the Japanese version are still here in great form. The score, to me, sounds to be arranged like this is a Hollywood blockbuster. It has more power, it has more emphasis, it's clearer and deeper. The film's prologue, the first seconds where we are introduced to the airships, has some new music (I am not sure, but I believe when we first saw the ships there was no music at all). But a majority of the music has new backdrops and more background music to enjoy. Things seem very enhanced. In a powerful scene, the music is more stronger then in the original versions. In a calm scene, it's more calmer. Overall, I think many of you will be pleased with the new arrangements an mixes, I highly did myself, and personally think it helps improve the film. I prefer the new score over the old one, and I hope Disney will release or license the music rights to a full blown soundtrack.Another plus side to the dub is that the story remains faithful, and much of the original Japanese lines are intact. In Kiki, I'm sure a few lines where changed, and this is the same way, lines have been changed. But a majority are close or exactly the original lines and dialogue Miyazaki has written. I was afraid some excellent lines would be butchered, but they were there intact. Some new lines have been added as well which help out. But I am not sure whether to consider this a good thing or a bad thing, Disney DID NOT translate the ending song, it was in Japanese. I was mortified when they did completely new songs for the Kiki dub, but with this version it's the original song... in Japanese. So I guess it's good it's still the original, but bad since a majority of people seeing this dub speak English.There is a big down side to this dub, and it deals with how the voices match the character's lips. Of course in any dub it won't be perfect, but I think in Kiki and Mononoke the dubbing of lines to match were much better executed (and Disney had a little bit more time with this one...). Some of the time everything matches perfect, some of the time it doesn't completley match, and in a rare case, someone says something and the lips don't move at all (there's a scene where Sheeta chuckles and her mouth doesn't move one bit).As far as things about the film itself, these are my thoughts. I thought the most amazing part of Laputa was the animation. From the opening sequence to the ending, the animation is so lush and detailed, you just have to watch in awe. You see the true nature of each character, true detail to their face with extreme close ups and action. You have to give a ton of credit for the effort that these animators put into this film. Everything is so well done and beautifully hand drawn, it's like a moving piece of art. And to think, this was done in the mid 1980's. The animation is quite different from Disney, Ghibli has it's own distinctive flare which is very different, but very good. And after all these years, the colors look as vibrant as ever. Laputa also has tons of action sequences, lots of plane dogfights plus a few on ground. These sequences are so well done and so intriguing, it's scary that they are comparable to a big budget action film. And the finale is just something you MUST see. The sound effects are pure and classic and fit explosions, guns firing and everything else well. And like all Miyazaki films, each one focuses on a different theme (i.g. Kiki: Confidence). This one has a great a lesson on greed and power. People don't realize how greed can take over you, and how having too much power isn't good. People are obsessed with power, and are greedy, and the main villian, Muska, greatly shows this.All in all, Laputa: Castle In The Sky was a great film to begin with, and is now improved for the most part. I am glad a more mainstream audience now have the chance to see this classic animated film in all it's glory. With a great voice cast who put a lot into the film with the excellent redone musical score from Joe Hisaishi, Disney has done a nice job on this dub and is quite worthy. Though I think the voices matched the mouths better in the Kiki and Princess Mononoke Disney dubs, Castle In The Sky is still a great dub and is worth the long delays because now more can expierence a fantastic film.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the most amazing movie!,"As you probably know Miyazaki created many animes. This is one of his works, and like all of his works, it is simply amazing. Many people do not realize this but Most of Miyazaki's movies are intended for older/adult audiences, despite the fact that it seems like for children. Therefore even adults will appreciate his movies. The story is kind of slow in the beginning because it seems that the rising action part has to be long for the audiences to understand. It is after about 1/3 of the movie when it gets exciting. The story is just amazing and watching this will brings all the fantasies that you had when you were kid. The animation is beautiful, although if you saw all of his movies the character shapes and landscapes do start to change. I was little disappointed with animation because it wasn't as sharp and beautiful as his later works but it still surpasses most animations out there. Even if you are not a fan of anime this is a must see for everyone. I would give this movie 9.2/10.BTW: Why is it spelled Rapyuta in Japanese version? Because Japanese language lack certain pronounciation that exist in English/latin, therefore it is easier for them to say ""ra"" than ""la"" and ""pyu"" than ""pu"".",,Anonymous,Animation
The less magical Ghibli feature,"Watching this movie as a part of my project to see all the IMDb top 250 movies. Laputa: Castle in the Sky is another widely loved fantasy themed animation feature by the visionary anime creator Hayao Miyazaki. However, compared to the other films of Miyazaki that I have seen (and which are on the IMDb top 250 list) this feels most like a genuine children tale. It's not as subtle and magical as the more successful Spirited Away or My Neighbor Totoro. The characters can be easily classified as ""good"" or ""evil"" and the film is stuffed with straightforward action. However, this is not necessary a bad thing - at least for a genuine children movie. Animation and drawing are - as can be expected - as good as usual. Interestingly all Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli animations (that I have seen so far) have several common features: a young girl as the main protagonist, elder female character with authority, castles and air-crafts. Furthermore, some of the animated characters (for example small fox- like animals in the Laputa island) appear again in later or earlier Ghibli features. To summarize, Laputa: Castle in the Sky has its moments but feels generally more like your standard Saturday morning cartoon feature (on the Pokemon- Digimon-axis) than the other Miyazaki movies.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Miyazaki turns fantasy on its wonderful, conventional head once again","Castle in the Sky (full title Laputa: Castle in the Sky) is another in the extraordinary works in the cannon of Hayao Miyazaki, who is arguably the master of fantasy in animation, worldwide. It's plot should be able to read through easily, at least for anyone who's seen the main conventional point of either the Dark Crystal or Lord of the Rings (probably the former is a little more accurate).A princess has to get to a location with a sacred object- in this case an rock-amulet- and take it to the main power source on Laputa, a secret castle that can barely be said to exist except in rumor. She goes on an adventure with another curious party, a boy, and the two of them have to contend with pirates and a nefarious man in a suit along the way. The twists are turned on a familiar premise at every step, however, because Miyazaki lets his imagination and influences spring out all over the place.We get vines and clouds and Superman-inspired robots! What Castle in the Sky promises is what it delivers full-throttle; it's action and excitement for a family audience (and it's not to sound patronizing; dudes in their 20s and gals in their 30s will love this as much as the little ones who sought out Spirited Away and Totoro so), and humor in bits and pieces as well (maybe not as much as Totoro, or skewed in a surreal way like Mononoke, but it's still there in a light tone with the pirates). And the design overall should capture everyone's fancy; from the Goliath ship to the little details of the robots to the expanse and crevices of Laputa, to what looks like it MUST have been special visual FX animation, it's all mind-boggling and mind-blowing at the same measure.It might not be Miyazaki's ultimate triumph, but it's still great film-making, a triumph of imagination to deliver on a tale of good vs. evil.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Amazing quality animation, a very unusual story and a whole lotta fun","This is a really interesting movie that bears some resemblance to another great Miyazaki film, KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE. Like KIKI, the action takes place on some Earth-like world--so much like Earth but different because it had the weirdest flying machines and sky pirates! It was also rather reminiscent of the Dreamcast video game, The Skies of Arcadia. and the X-Box's Crimson Skies. Strange but also pretty intriguing--that's for sure. For fans of airplanes and vintage aviation, this is an especially appealing film.Well, in this world of sky pirates and bizarre flying machines comes the rumor of a floating castle in the sky. And, of course, our intrepid heroes are bent on finding it and unlocking its secrets.The film has amazing animation, a unique style and is very engaging. While kids will enjoy it immensely, unlike some Miyazaki films, I really think that in some cases adults might like this even more than kids. Good stuff well worth a look.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
imaginative world,"Sheeta with her crystal manages to escape from pirate Captain Dola and her sons. She falls out of the airship and ends up floating to the ground where she is rescued by young Pazu.

With pirates and government agents after her, they have to rediscover the power of her crystal and the lost Castle in the Sky.This world is imaginative. The story is a bit muddled. The dialog is a little clunky. The slapstick comedy is broad. I'm not sure that every motivation makes sense. I'm not sure why Dola joins Pazu to help Sheeta. The pirates are shooting up everybody to get the crystal in the beginning and I don't understand why they switch sides.

My brief review of the film,"Hayao Miyazaki's screenplay here is just excellent. The story is imaginative and at times quite moving, plus there are many funny moments to be had along the way. The characters are however overly silly and only ever lightly developed, but everything else about the script works so well that it easy to forgive its shortcomings. The music is rather charming and the animation itself is great too. Some of the violence does not quite work, but there are so many other scenes that simply radiate with beauty. The running time of over two hours is a bit lengthy, but watching it is by all means time well spent. If not quite the masterpiece that 'Spirited Away' is, this one comes pretty close.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hands down...the best and most enjoyable animated film I have ever seen,"A Perfect 10!

There's not much more to say; the animation is beautiful for the time, and the story is absolutely amazing.However, contrary to its appearance, the film truly appeals to both adults as well as children.

An Adventure For All Ages,"Ah, I remember first seeing this on Toonami. Month of Miyazaki was the best thing they ever did.

The scenes on Laputa itself are among the best in Ghibli's filmography, in terms of gorgeous animation and background (IMHO).I find myself giving many Ghibli films 7/10s.

Simply Magic!,"First time I viewed this Miyazakian work, I viewed it in the long lost 1986 English dub as I managed to dreg up a VHS from the nether regions of forgotten items. I'm not normally an admirer of dubbings, rather preferring to listen to the film in its truest context, and multi-tasking in the duality required to watch the film. The new dub is not particularly successful however. Optimistic and buoyed by the 86 version, Disney lost the plot. Replacing quintessential humanism and character traits, with big names, for the big return. However, in which ever context you view this film, it is (in a time when the word is so flippantly used) an epic. The humanism and raw emotion coupled with 1930s-esque styled adventure movies provides a sheer hotpot of entertainment ripe for any occasion. The film more than entertains, yet doesn't bare the hallmarks of overrated, nonsensical, unnecessary fight scenes, opting for calmer, yet still thrilling, ""chase"" and ""action"" sequences. The plot is encapsulating, checking all the quotas for the Miyazakian masterpiece checklist. Miyazaki is a master of charting adolescent journeying. The emotional growth his characters go through is superbly done, as not to seem condescending or patronising, all the while being simple believable and simply magical.Reviews often delve into the content of the film, revealing spoilers, but merely look at the support for Miyazaki's films on this website alone!!! This doesn't arise from techno-nerds, neo-skaters and all the social sects of pubescent society wishing to carry the cool card by the knowledge of foreign anime. This film is simply stunning. An encapsulating roller-coaster of a journey, with genuine feelings and genuine people (for cartoons). Miyazaki's ratings come from his attention to plot, first and foremost. This is why he's successful, because his movies carry a message but are engrossing and entertaining.This may not be the most helpful review as to the films plot line, but let it be known, once watched you will be addicted. If you've never seen a Miyazaki film before, this is a prime tester, with Nausicaa and Mononoke somewhat on the ""heavy"" side, and whilst Spirited Away is as close to perfection as cinema can be, it is a dish best served til later, to fully appreciate. Laputa is a film for any mood.Yet, the thing that always stands out for me, is the score. The final moments at the end of the film, when the theme Kimi o Nosete begins, is truly exquisite. Yes, it is 80s in its composition, yet coupled with the emotive nature of the film, never fails to jerk a nerve.Superb story-telling. Superb film.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

It's obvious people say Spirited Away is the best, but I really disagree. Most people only know that movie because it one an Acedmy Award; this isn't an exaggeration - I've shown Princess Mononoke and Castle in the Sky to people who'd only ever seen Spirited Away, and they agree that the latter two are the superior of the three. Personally, I'd never thought that anything could compare to Princess Mononoke, until I finally saw Castle in the Sky. I still think that the prior is the better of the two, but Castle in the Sky is easily on par with it; in many ways, Castle has major elements that Mononoke was missing.

"My all-time favorite Ghibli film, endlesslessly rewatchable","I have watched this movie dozens of times going all the way back to watching the VHS at age 5. It remains my favorite Studio Ghibli film and will remain a masterpiece that is endlessly re-watchable.An all-ages Indiana Jones action caper combined with Ghibli's unbeatable animation and Miyazaki's obvious love for aviation created one of my favorite films of all time. The movie runs at a breakneck pace and is constantly moving. You are on board with the characters who know just as much as the audience does. As the film continues, the villain becomes a ruthless menace to the main characters, culminating in one of the best action climaxes you will ever see. Every ounce of tension and suspense is utilized placing characters in harrowing situations in every action set piece. The animation is so fluid and colorful it is a feast for the eyes.The score is John Williams-esque. The characters are a treat to watch, and the movie keeps a fantastic level of lightheartedness to keep things enjoyable and fun. The villains are foreboding that you love to hate. I can go on and on.I recommend watching on VHS if you can find a copy. For some reason, a lot of background audio was removed when it was carried over to DVD and Blu-ray and streaming. Also, the Disney Dub is the superior version by far. They recruited a lot of talent from famous actors to make it so I never want to go back to the Japanese version.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
My 300th movie!,"As someone who loves great films, I felt bad about not having seen most of Miyazaki's masterpieces. I have yet to see any of them that I would give a score lower than three and a half stars and this is no exception as it's easily a four star movie. I really do think it's great that this film uses both celebrity voices and voice actors, as well as Mark Hamill who's actually both! The animation may not be as good as ""Spirited Away"", but it's still gorgeous to look at. I have been watching one movie a day since last December and decided to view this as my 300th movie overall.It's because I bought a fairly expensive copy of it. I had heard this set a record for most Tweets about a single subject or something like that. Whatever the record, this was great to watch. It was actually pretty rare that Miyazaki movies had a story with an actual villain in it. They rarely have black and white morality. This film, however, was a great exception and I admit to liking the idea of a more traditional story from him. I've also never seen anything from him that was an outright action movie. Yes, this had great drama, but it certainly had tons of action and explosions!I guess it's kind of weird being a fan of traditional anime like ""Dragonball Z"", but this appears to obviously be something more cultured. I just think they're both great in their own way and their genres well. I guess this is the closest Miyazaki ever came to a typical action movie. Needless to say, it still has the great emotion that makes his film a masterpiece. The characters are still pretty morally ambiguous. The air pirates seem evil at first, but you definitely lighten up to them as time goes on. It was great to recognize Jim Cummings' voice, especially since I actually met the guy at a con!I love the designs of the robots. I was really impressed at how bad I felt for the original one. Robots are common in anime, but this was a truly emotional take on them. I really did feel sorry for this poor guy as he kept getting injured trying to help Sheeta. You briefly see some magic creatures that almost look like pokemon. It's great to see how such a great artist influenced all kinds of different anime. It takes a little while to get really good, but it's still flawless. This is for kids, adults, and anyone. ****",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good adventure film for all ages.,"I saw this when it first hit the home video market, and was enamored with the scope and scale of Miyazaki's imagination. Like a lot of good Japanese animation (anime) this one doesn't stick with giant robots or sadistic antagonists, or other familiar tropes that pervade anime and science fiction in general.Having said that there is a military bent or element placed in the film. As with some other Miyazaki offerings the military is seen as a tool that is often misguided or misused for other people's schemes. So it is that Paizu, the main character, and Sheeta, the damsel in distress with a family secret, are challenged by the local authorities as they seek to discover her origins and the source of intrigue regarding her past.The film is an anime epic, long in scope and vast in imagination, and filled with both action and adventure as well as more reflective moments. And when I said this was a good adventure film for all ages, I meant it. Where there is some military violence, there's no blood shed, and the sexual intrigue is kept G-rated, PG at worst (and in a very Japanese cultural vein), unlike a lot of science fiction offerings from Japanese animation usually aimed at teenage boys and older. Families can watch this, though very young viewers may get apprehensive or questioning at some of the action.""Castle in the Sky"" is a riff on a story element from Jonathan Swift's ""Gulliver's Travels"" regarding a flying city, hence the title of the film. Though unlike Swift's tale this story doesn't take place in the 18th century, but in the Victorian era with what is often referred to as a ""steampunk"" setting.As with a lot of Japanese ""anime"" offerings, the animation, though vast in scope and impressive in the tale it brings, it's not Disney. That is to say the animation is somewhat stilted, though a bit smoother than a lot of anime of the time. Even so it is still a pleasure to watch, though older children might get a little impatient with it.A great Myazaki offering. Watch it on a lazy weekend afternoon, or perhaps when there's nothing else on during the week. Either way, enjoy.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Not Miyazaki's best, but it still contains his trademark magic'","Like many Americans, I was first introduced to the works of Hayao Miyazaki when I saw ""Spirited Away."" I fell in love with the film and have seen it many times. Now I am on a search to see every film by Miyazaki. One of his earlier works is ""Castle in the Sky."" Although it's still enjoyable, it's not as good as ""Spirited Away"" (though comparing this or any film to his 2002 masterpiece is perhaps unfair).A young boy named Pazu (James Van Der Beek) is working in a mine late one night, when he sees a girl fall slowly from the sky. When she wakes up the next morning, she introduces herself as Sheeta (Anna Paquin). But Sheeta has a secret, and before he knows it, Pazu is pulled into an adventure that will lead him into danger with pirates, the army and a lost floating city.Going into a film by Hayao Miyazaki means you can expect one thing: a sense of wonder and magic. Many filmmakers have tried, but no one can create a sense of magic and awe like Miyazaki. Watching a film by Miyazaki is like experiencing a fantastic dream from your childhood.Because the film is animated, dubbing the film does not pose much of a problem because it is next to impossible to determine whether or not the lip movements match up to the words. It also helps that the translated dialogue is well-written and voiced by talented actors. The voice acting is varied. James Van Der Beek fares best. He brings an irresistible enthusiasm and excitement to the role of Pazu that is perfect for the character. Anna Paquin is nearly as good as Sheeta. She's frightened by the events going on around her, but she knows what she has to do. Mark Hamill is unrecognizable as the evil Muska. He's dangerous and wants something from Sheeta, and will do anything to get it. The other voices are bad. Cloris Leachman is awful as Dola. Leachman may have won an Oscar for ""The Last Picture Show,"" but she's annoying as the pirate leader. Leachman gives the character an obnoxious squawk that's nearly always monotonous. It's so bad it nearly ruins the film! Jim Cummings is an effective voice-over actor, but he's miscast as the general.I would definitely recommend seeing ""Castle in the Sky."" I'll probably end up buying it myself. But even though it's not as good as ""Spirited Away,"" it's still pretty good.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

An epic animated adventure worth visiting over and over again,"Animated films can become a lot of things (especially nowadays with updated technology and a newfound respect for the medium), including romantic, life changing, groundbreaking, political, or sometimes just flatout surreal in scale. No longer are animated films just cartoons for kids to watch and enjoy, that stereotype is long gone. However, epic is not a word you can use to describe animated films, because they just don't happen often. Animated movies with the ability to become compared to the likes of Lawrence of Arabia, Gone with the Wind, Ben-Hur, Seven Samurai and other epic films past and present are extremely rare to find. However if there is a man that can weave a blockbuster animated tale, it would be the Japanese answer to America's Walt Disney. Castle in the Sky is epic in scale, with a massive adventure full of lush scenery, incredible action, memorable characters, and a nice dosage of humor. If there is an epic cartoon, it would be this underrated masterpiece.Castle in the Sky follows two kids that met under curious circumstances (Sheeta and Pazu) racing against pirates, the army, and mysterious agents in pursuit of a mythical castle located somewhere in the skies above the clouds. Sheeta is aided by a mysterious necklace given to her by her parents when she was younger. All the competition has their differing reasons on why they want to find the castle, ranging from gold to unleashing God-like powers. The film works mainly because the story is very unique, very original, and quite unpredictable. Written by Hayao Miyazaki, this film is the best evidence that his mind is among the most creative in film-making within the past century.The world displayed here is among the most gorgeous in the history of animation. There are massive airships the size of cities, caves that can look like the bowels of outer space, entire worlds that just float high midair and just entire towns built on the mountainside, leading to some unique and detailed architecture. No computer-work here, as this movie proves that hand-drawn animation's personal touch can be as magical as the best visual effects coming from any computer. The variety in colors and images here trounces those of Miyazaki's more popular works, like Spirited Away and My Neighbor Totoro.The epicness can be mainly traced to the consistent amount of peril and action throughout the two hours of pure movie magic. The opening sequence sets the tone for the rest of the film, while a humorous yet impressive train chase half an hour later provides some of the best thrills ever seen in an animated movie. Every so often humor breaks off the epic taint in the production, but it never dwells or outstays its welcome. Steampunk is a tough sell, since it's a historical and contextual contradiction. But in Castle in the Sky, Miyazaki gives the viewers time to adapt and witness the technological advancements and mannerisms of the characters in the film so you don't become too distracted by the unrealistic nature of it all.Miyazaki is the current Walt Disney, because not only does he avoid sequels (Pixar is unfortunately dwelling in this path) but he does his best to deliver a different animated experience every time he releases something new. Like Walt Disney himself, he can seamlessly blend humor, heart, and suspense all in one. He has the pacing, patience, and abilities of any decent Hollywood director, but with film you can do so much more. You can create shots that real-life cameras could never accomplish; and with animation you can create visuals that not a single CGI machine could ever duplicate. This is perhaps the main reason why Miyazaki avoids too much computer animation and avoids filming real-life altogether. When mentioning great directors like Spielberg, Scorsese, Peter Jackson, and David Fincher, Miyazaki is more than worthy to be mentioned in the sentence.Bottom Line: Castle in the Sky is a flawless work of art that spins audiences into a beautiful world full of steampunk goodness and lush scenery that's obviously influenced by the underrated landscape of Japan. Within the confides of this beautiful world (that travels by sea, land, and air) lies a wonderful story full of humor, heart, action, suspense, and an underlying message that's present in almost all Miyazaki movies. Pixar obviously has taken notes from the works on Japanese Walt Disney, as this movie has scenes and moments that can be compared to those of Finding Nemo, Toy Story, and even Up. If you enjoy excellent animated movies, you cannot miss this gem, as it's entertaining, thrilling, and mystical from the first second to the last.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Is Hollywood listening yet?,"As the Hollywood oil tanker continues to sail our cultural seas, spilling Hogwaarts students, aristocratic archaeologists and Charlie's Angels like so much poisonous crude oil, a thought occurs to me... 'why not watch a Miyazaki movie and pretend ""Agent Cody Banks Goes To Hades"" isn't about to be green lit for $80 million'Laputa is a feast in every way. Very rarely are children's characters so subtly and satisfyingly created on film. The relationship between the two leads, Pazu and Sheeta, is at the heart of this stunning fantasy-adventure, but also seeking the lost floating city (for different reasons) are colourful pirates and government agents who complete an excellent and ambiguous character dynamic.The film sits somewhere between Nausicaa and Totoro in terms of Miyazakis themes. It has the epic (and environmental) feel of the former with the latter's more personal focus on children's relationships and how honest friendship can ease the difficulties inherent in growing up. Sound sickly? Well it isn't. Miyazaki has almost supernatural judgment in these matters.For anyone looking for a film they can watch with the kids, you'll find this hard to beat. Nobody can bridge the generation gap like Miyazaki. Frankly, hardly anybody working today can make movies like Miyazaki.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Fantastic Film from THE Hayao Miyazaki,"This movie is Fantastic and breathe taking at the same time. Castle in the Sky is one of my 5 top personal favorites of Miyazaki's films.The best thing about this movie is that it's taken place in a world containing Aircraft machines of all kinds. This film shows how Miyazaki likes flying machines. It's an old anime film, but it's very well animated for an old movie.The animation, story, background, characters, and voice talents are all great. It's a blend of Action, Adventure, Fantasy, Sci-fi, Comedy, and Drama all in one. The voice overs for the English version is very amusing, Mark Hamil is excellent with his role as the main villain Col. Musca. Jim Cumming(Famous Voice actor) plays a General, not a common role but he's just great with the part.The entire movie is all great from beginning to the end. Many of Miyazaki's films don't often have a good vs. bad related story. This movie how ever is like one of his only ones containing an actually villain, and this movie's villain is a cool one too.I give it 8/10, I recommend buying or renting the movie. It's suitable for Ages 8 and up.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Entertaining fantasy film,"I had avoided watching 'Castle in the Sky' for many years. I was aware of Miyazaki's exemplary track record, and have enjoyed several of his films to date. However, I was aware that many of his earlier films were geared toward younger audiences. That, combined with the marketing materials (even before Disney got their hands on it) showed nothing of some of the more exciting elements of the story. All I knew was about young boy who met a young girl who 'fell from the sky', and that the film involved some kind of 'Castle in the Sky'. Sounds like a whole lot of ho-hum ""let's put on a kiddie show"" type stuff.Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised. The story deftly blends magic and technology in an early industrial culture. Yes, the orphan boy, Pazu does meet the orphan girl Sheeta when she fell from the sky - but the reason she fell was no mystical fairy tale reason - she was hanging off the side of an airship, being pursued by pirates, secret agents and the military! Thus begins a rousing chase, and a search for the ultimate weapon - Laputa, an island (not just a castle) floating in the sky.There's action and adventure aplenty. And the film should be of particular interest to the steampunk crowd as it's an early anime influence on the genre. There are a few things you have to overlook, such as attempts at humor both scripted, and ad libbed by the English cast, which fall flat, an annoyingly repetitive musical score, and the inevitable moralizing that gets pretty thick at the end of most anime features. But it's worth putting up with that stuff for the fun ride. Be sure to skip the John Lassiter intro which adds nothing to the proceedings.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Masterpiece,"This film is a masterpiece: visually stunning and full of poetry.  Again, Miyazaki shows his ability to rediscover a child's sense of wonder.  The plot here, like that of Princess Mononoke, demonstrates his mythopoetic genius: he has taken elements from existing stories and woven them into a compelling, visionary narrative: here we have the world of Dickens married to Swift's floating island Laputa, with dashes of swashbuckling pirate tales.  Miyazaki is always fascinated by flight (Kiki, Spirited Away, Porco Rosso, Totoro), but nowhere does he do anything as magical with that theme as here.  He has transposed sea-going vessels, and all the imagery associated with it (pirates, ocean liners, great gunships), into the air. This film seems to cancel the real history of flight, and to substitute another, imaginary version.  A double anachronism: this is the way the nineteenth century would have imagined flight.  It cannot be denied either that the film has a strong emotional dimension: the boy who dreams of flying goes back to the mine and watches as a girl floats down from the sky into his arms!  The film is filled with moments of stunning beauty, poetically and visually: Pazu and Sheeta in the gondola over the pirate ship watch the huge gunship emerge below them; the destruction of Laputa - the walls come crumbling down and rain into the sea - Apocalypse; the great tree of Laputa floats away at the end.The more I reflect on Miyazaki's films, the more I am convinced that he is one of the greatest filmmakers, one of the great artists of our time.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
If You Have Seen Fututre Boy Conan or Howl's Moving...Skip This,"Miyazaki's films often have similar themes and similarly drawn characters. If I have to reframe from mentioning his other works and look solely at this film I suppose I would give it a 7 out of 10 and say it was good. However having seen Future Boy Conan before this as well as Nausicaa Of The Valley Of The Wind and Howl's Moving Castle I would have to say this this movie in comparison to the aforementioned is skipable as it pales in comparison to those movies in story-telling, overall scenes, and English dubbing. I find that this movie shares similarities with the other movies in that: In Future Boy Conan the aircraft resemble moths/bugs. In this movie the aircraft resemble dragonflies/bugs. In ever movie mentioned here there is a theme of high technology controlled by the government/past that can destroy the world and a young boy and girl try and prevent this technology from destroying the world...There are similar looking characters.....Overall Future Boy Conan has more lovable characters and more humor. There are scenes in that series that are laugh out loud funny and heart warming as well! It's well worth the watch. And Nausica of The Valley is a great summary of Future Boy Conan.. It closely follows the theme of that series and reinterprets it in a new way and puts it in a feature length film VS a series of episodes and it does a great job of expressing high destructive technology vs peace loving nature....Does that make sense? Basically I have seen those movies and love them more than this. I was looking forward to this movie being great but i felt it was just a waste of time. It also bothered me how the boy in this movie never got to fly his aircraft that he built (then why even show it???) and how he didn't seem to posses any special skill 3/4ths of the movie yet somehow could climb like spider-man near the end and do things no human could ever do. He somehow had hands and feet that could cling unrealistically to a metal tube that went upwards- and free-climbed across roots like a monkey and it was just so unrealistic it bothered me....At least in Future Boy Conan the boy was shown from the very beginning as having unusual strength and skill. But this boy in this movie was ordinary until the end when he made a 360....",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Laputa Castle in the sky - AMAZING!,"If you like studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki then you will LOVE 'Laputa castle in the sky'. The story focuses on an Orphan girl Sheeta who literally falls from the sky to be caught by another young orphan boy, Pazu, together the two of them discover that the crystal necklace around Sheeta's neck is no ordinary necklace, it is in fact a relic from the levitation stone on the floating magical island of Laputa. The two of them realise the importance of the necklace when they are chased by crazy pirates and evil government agents all of whom want to capture and harness the power of the crystal for themselves. Together Sheeta and Pazu go in search of the floating island of laputa and encounter many twists and turns on the way!

Better than 'Spirited away' by far!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The old version was way better,"Am I making this up? When I was just a kid I saw this on TV, and it was just so much better. The music was more dramatic, the voice acting was less-kiddified, and the whole movie had a more intense feel to it.I was so disappointed when I turned it on, that I promptly turned it off again. I wasn't going to let James Van Der Whatzit ruin one of my favorite childhood characters. Did they even watch the old one? Chances are, no, they didn't.Basically I'm frustrated. I was looking forward to reminiscing for a couple of hours, but I ended up doing laundry because I couldn't watch it. The excitement and maturity of the first English-version is lost to a bunch of silly ad-libs, squeaky voices, and muted music.Blech. Where can I find an old copy on DVD?",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
The movie has a touch of magic and science fiction.,"Tenkuu no Shiro Laputa aka Castle in the Sky is tied as my favorite Miyazaki movie. The story of Castle in the Sky is about, you guessed it; a castle in the sky. There's a legend about a floating island castle, called ""Laputa"" that contains all the riches a person can ever dream of having. The main male character, Panzo believes that the castle exists, and dreams of one day following his deceased father's footsteps, and finding the castle for himself. The only problem is, he doesn't know where the castle is. Then there's the main female character, Sheeta whom Panzo finds falling/floating down from the sky with a shining sky blue necklace that has some sort of relationship to Laputa's location. Panzo and Sheeta begin a friendship, perhaps love relationship and they decide to go on a journey to find Laputa together. But they run into trouble with, and clowny pirates, the greedy army along with some mysterious men led by an even more mysterious man named, Muska.
The stupid army was really funny, as were the pirates. Panzo and Sheeta are your average Miyazaki main characters, absolutely tragic and lovable! Honestly there's nothing to dislike about this anime and so much to love. It's truly a heart-pounding adventure story about friendship, loyalty, greed, and people's connection to nature. The anime starts off innocently and happily, but it quickly becomes darker as the evil ambitions of the antagonists make themselves known. The characters, good and evil, are all fully developed and interesting to watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Miyazaki at his very best,"They released this film (as a re-release) just after howl's moving castle had visited the cinemas, and at first I didn't want to check it out because the title - a castle in the sky - seemed too similar to the former, but then, because it is miyazaki, after all, i couldn't resist, and i must say i totally loved it. It was like a real time-travel in terms of miyazaki development: you can see where he gets lots of character designs for the future from, especially when it comes to 'grannies' and the soundtrack. The story was very cool, the start was very dramatic and left you asking a lot of questions (like a real appetizer) about what happens. I was very impressed with pazu, especially as a role-model kind of character, and I think the relationship between him and sheeta is the most romantic miyazaki to date. those of you who are well acquainted with miyazaki's other works will recognise certain things as if they were directly taken from here, some of it really is quite uncanny, but you've got to love it all the same.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Castle in the sky is a dream come true,"This movie is probably the the second best Mayazaki film, the first is Nausicaa, the only reason why is probably because of the two leads voice actors, not that there's anything too wrong with them, their not annoying, its just i couldn't match the voices with the characters, in nausiccaa the voices are perfect. but other than that this movie is probably better than some Disney films, i actually thought it was Disney when i saw it as a little kid. The soundtrack is amazing, the art used for this film is something out of a dream, in fact the plot seems like something out of dream as well, that is what a cartoon movie is supposed to do. Despite not liking the 2 leads voices i like their characters, i like the pirates, and all the townspeople, but i love the villain played by Mark Hamill, who I'm not kidding actually uses his iconic joker laugh in this movie, every time he showed up on screen i felt the tension increase, probably one of the best cartoon villains ever. The movie can be slow a few times, but it not that big of a deal, but when the action starts, your heart starts pumping faster. i prefer this film and nausiccaa to all of mayazakis other work only because here he had bloodless carnage and didn't use too much gratuitous violence or creepy images yet, i know those are his trademarks but i find them sometimes unnecessary, and i think this movie can prove that",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Studio Ghibli's Feature Film Debut,"The first anime produced & released under the banner of Studio Ghibli, Castle in the Sky (also known as Laputa: Castle in the Sky) is an elegantly crafted, smart narrated & nicely composed adventure which brings us the tale of a young girl in possession of a mysterious crystal who, after ending up in the care of a young boy, embark on a journey with him to find the mythic floating castle of Laputa while they're being pursued by pirates, army & secret agents working for the government who desire the very same thing.Written & directed by Hayao Miyazaki, the film is infused with this renowned filmmaker's trademarks & thematic elements plus is effectively paced from start to finish. The animation is wonderful to look at, the characters are worthy of our attention, the voice actors have done a fine job in bringing their given roles to life, the camera-work is pretty fluid & the minimalistic use of score works like an enchantment. Also, the floating castle of Laputa is a sight to behold & its meticulous detailing only evokes more admiration for the effort that went into its creation.On an overall scale, Castle in the Sky is the feature film which commenced the legacy of now- legendary Studio Ghibli on a considerably high note and although it isn't one of Miyazaki's finest films in my opinion but its uplifting story & quality narration is impressive enough to make sure that its viewers are entertained & intrigued throughout its runtime. A powerhouse of creativity & imagination, Castle in the Sky is an awe-inspiring work from a master storyteller that promises an enriching cinematic experience & delivers it effortlessly. Positively recommended.",,Anonymous,Animation
Castle in the sky has Miyazaki's signature all over it!,"Castle in the sky is undoubtedly a Hayao Miyazaki film. After seeing it for the first time I'm glad to say that it doesn't disappoint. On the contrary, you get your time's worth, which means (as to what Miyazaki's films are concern), that is nothing less than excellent!Produced early in his cinematic career, Castle in the Sky anticipates many of the trade marks in his later movies, with strong (but young) female characters, forced to grow up due to external circumstances, helped out by very interesting (and some times lovable) supporting characters. And of course, flying machines (lots of it!!). Never the less, Miyazaki had already got his theatrical debut two years earlier, with Nausicãa, which was narratively speaking, a dress rehearsal for Princess Mononoke, his magnum opus. Castle in the Sky is set a bit a part from these two, with a soft action packed first 30 minutes, resembling his TV series Conan, and his directed episodes of Meitantei Holmes. In here we are introduced to Sheeta, a girl who literally falls from the sky, only to be found by Pazu, a young boy working in a little countryside mining town. Intrigued by her amnesia and suspecting a connection between her and the mysterious flying city of Laputa, Pazu is set on helping her find out where she came from, whilst escaping the army and a gang of air pirates. As the movie progresses, the plot gets heavier and much more interesting, revealing Myiazaki at his best.The sound track is very reminiscent of Spirited Away, (or vice versa, as Castle in the sky was produced first), and much like its director, Joe Hisaishi _the composer_ starts with a very light score, that gets more complex and beautifully fitting as the plot goes forward!A note to the English dubbing, with a good interpretation from the two lead stars, although Anna Paquin's Sheeta has a very thick accent (which the actress still had at that point in her career), and a heads up for Mark Hamil as Muska, making up for a delightfully yet devilish villain!Don't miss this one people!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Enjoyable fairtytale with some great graphics...,"Saw this on SBS TV here in Australia the other week, where it was titled ""Laputa: Castle in the sky"". I had enabled subtitles and I think SBS provided their own for that, which, as usual, was of very good quality.Just looked up ""Laputa"" on Wikipedia and it confirms what I suspected...the floating island of this tale is taken from the classic Jonathan Swift novel ""Gulliver's travels"", which was published in the early to mid 1700s.Anyway, this is an engaging Japanese fairytale, which features an English speaking voice-cast. It's suitable for young children, I think, but it does run at just over two hours in length, so it may be too long for some, though not for an adult like me.The story concerns two children who seek to find a legendary floating island which has a castle on it. The children are not the only ones looking for this island. They have pirates, the army and spies looking for the island too, and looking to capture the children (Sheeta, the girl, voiced by Anna Paquin, and Pazu, the boy, voiced by James Van Der Beek) in order to help them find it.The graphics are magnificent...sort of photo-realistic at times, especially the scenes of stonework lit by torch-light, or the pretty scenes of bright, sunny days, with white clouds, or mist.Recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Another Sterling Work from One of the Greatest Directors,"I am so glad John Lasseter is friends with Miyazaki. If he wasn't, we may not have gotten these movies dubbed and formally released stateside. Say what you want about dubs vs subs and blah blah blah, but I often enjoy closing my eyes and immersing myself in movies. And it also allows so many more people to see these movies. And they are movies that deserve to be seen.Lasseter's efforts here combined the fact that he more or less brought CGI animation to the masses have elevated him in my mind to the position of second most important person and third greatest person in animation to me. If you're wondering, the first list is Disney, Lasseter, Miyazaki and the second is Disney, Miyazaki, Lasseter.The crazy thing is that I come into these movies expecting to be blown away. Most movies where this is the case, even the ones I adore, like Shawshank and LOTR, are diminished just a bit by this. Not these movies. Every time I see them, they grab my soul and run with it. Part of it is that the movies are such a stark change from American animation in every regard. The tone, the style; it's all different. The closest American animations I've seen to these masterpieces are the old Disney movies, from which Miyazaki took inspiration. But even those are only half as long as these movies and not nearly as epic. The other part of it is that they are just so good.The images stick in my mind. For example, in the first third of this movie, the main characters go into an underground cave and the crystals react with a medallion that Sheena, one of the leads, is wearing. When they see why, they cut the rocks and it is revealed that there is what is dubbed as aetherium in them. In many other films, it would be a simple, expository scene. In this, it is a stylistic, atmospheric triumph. Scenes like that are littered throughout the movie. And they stick in my mind, as good animation and only good animation can do.Another, more personal reason why I love Miyazaki films is that I share with him a deep love of aviation. The word Ghibli, the name of the studio, even means 'hot wind blowing in from the Sahara.' It is one of his three trademarks, if you will, the other two being environmental messages and strong female protagonists, two things that are done well and subtly here, to the film's credit. The inclusion of aviation, on the other hand, is not subtle, and I love that about it. In fact, the sky and flight are probably featured more here than in any of his other movies, and that is saying something. For a major part of the movie, they don't even touch the earth.The flying scenes are all excellent. But I think my favorite is one near the middle of the film at sunset. It is in full color in my mind even as I write this review. Despite being a short scene, it makes you feel like you're in the sky like no other moment in any movie.It perfectly encapsulates the emotions which come with sunset, flight, and the air itself and mix it together into one bit of atmosphere that is invocative enough to pull your soul from your body, at least for a minute.The plot and pacing remind me, strangely, of Titanic. Not in any obvious way, but in that they both take a conventional tale and make it feel fresh and new, like you are a little kid hearing it for the first time. The characters are fleshed out well and the writing achieves a balance of making you know who they are without bogging the film down. The score is one of Hisaishi's best, and once again, that is saying something. I would compare the partnership between him and Miyazaki to the one between Williams and Spileberg, but, and I mean no offense to the latter pair, these two are above them. While Williams is a fine composer, I would argue that Hisaishi is one of the best composers of any kind over the last century.And the artwork? I've already said enough about how pretty this film is. In fact, the sequence of this movie that won me over is an artistic one. The opening credits sequence ( didn't take the film that long) is done in a different style, one that fits the movie like nothing else could and lays the groundwork for the movie ahead. Wow.This film is centered around the pursuit of a castle in the sky. And while it is stunning, as you know if you have watched this film, it cannot top another castle in the sky: the film itself. It is truly thus; as mystic and potent and artistic as Lapita itself. And unlike the main characters in the film, you don't have to go against a Mark Hamill-led military in order to get to it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Overrated anime fare,"Hayao Miyazaki has been getting a lot of praise recently as a result of the American release of his excellent 'Mononoke-Hime' and his somewhat less than excellent 'Spirited Away'. Castle in the Sky fits in between the two in terms of quality, but adds to the feeling that I got when the credits of 'Spirited Away' rolled that Hayao Miyazaki doesn't deserve such high praise as he's getting. Don't get me wrong, this certainly isn't a bad film (neither is Spirited Away), but it's hardly the work of a great master either. The substance on offer isn't much more than what you'd find in a Saturday morning cartoon, and the film takes itself way too seriously for an animated feature. Too much of the film is spent on characters delivering reams of heartfelt dialogue and it comes across as contrived and more than a little bit silly. However, this is matched by Miyazaki's inventiveness and attention to detail, which keeps the film away from the low end of the rating scale.With this film, Miyazaki has created his own world for his character's to inhabit, and that is always going to garner praise for the auteur. The story follows a young girl that has a crystal that has the power to show the owner the way to a mythical and powerful city in the sky. After escaping from various evildoers that want the crystal for their own reasons, she finds herself on the run with a young boy that also wants to find the lost city. This creativity is both a help and a hindrance to the story. On the one hand it allows Miyazaki creative freedom over what goes on, and he makes best use of that on many occasions. However, on the other hand, because the world isn't a complete whole - it leaves many questions unanswered, and after an hour or so of being bombarded with goings on that don't make much sense; the film gets more than a little bit tiresome. The film follows the classic adventure structure, which is nice as it makes for an entertaining ride. Castle in the Sky also has a nice musical score, which fits the tone of the film excellently.This film certainly isn't bad, but it's not great either and I suspect that more than a little of it's praise has come of a result of the popularity of Miyazaki's later works and the fact that Japanese things are very much in fashion of late. However, if anime is your bag, you'll find lots to like here.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Early Miyazaki's masterpiece,"It seems to me that if it were not for Miyazaki, it is unlikely that the popularity of anime throughout the world would be at the level it is now.I watched ""Castle in the Sky"" when I had already seen almost all of Miyazaki's works. And I didn't expect it to be so good. From the very first minutes, from the very opening credits, it captivates with detailed drawings and stunningly beautiful music by Joe Hisaishi. And it doesn't let go until the very end.As expected, in the span of just two hours, Hayao builds a whole world in which you believe, a world with its own laws and problems, with its own mythology. And the story itself is written quite well - initially you have no idea how the plot will turn out and what the motives of the characters are. At the same time, there are references to his previous works - for example, the robots, previously encountered in Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind.The main theme of the cartoon for Miyazaki's works is not new - the protection of nature. But in comparison with, for example, ""Princess Mononoke"", this cartoon is more suitable for children - it is less cruel. Which, however, does not mean that adults will be bored watching it - like Ponyo, it is designed for viewers of all ages. Strong in both audiovisual and narrative terms, it should appeal to the vast majority of viewers.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Unattainable Utopia in the Clouds,"Laputa is an amazing film and I recommend everyone to watch it at least once. I have watched it at least five times already. Just seeing this one film has made me a lifelong fan of Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki, whose films are all treasures to be cherished dearly.Rewatching Laputa again and again reveals the wonderful structure of its narrative. There is nothing unnecessary for the development of the plot, and it has been condensed to its bare essentials. Scenes proceed effortlessly from one to another and form a continous whole. Nothing is excessive, nothing is boring.At its core, Laputa is an adventure story, keeping you in suspense from beginning to finish. Young girl that falls from the sky seems to possess mystical powers, and is picked by a young boy living nearby. They then try to find out more about the mythical city of Laputa, which is said to be located high in the sky and possess magical technology not available for the rest of mankind.Within this seemingly simple story, themes of surprising depth are developed on the way. The destructive nature of humankind and technology, the endless desire for absolure power and wealth, the healing power of nature and friendship. There is more to the story than meets the eye. It reaffirms the message that is familiar from their other titles like Nausicaä or Princess Mononoke.In animation, Studio Ghibli simply reigns supreme above all competitors. The beauty of their style is unparallelled, and bring to mind best impressionist paintings of the 19th century. So clearly is the story told through mere pictures alone that I merely watching it through the pictures you would not miss much of the plot.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Spectacular!,"This movie is just as great as the other movies by this director such as Spirited Away.  This movie captures the spirit of imagination, and teaches you about love, bravery, cruelty, and honor.  The dubbed version was just awesome, and the casted voices from actors such as Mark Hamill, Anna Paquin, and James Van Der Beek were chosen perfectly for this peculiar role.

"Those pirates know she's a kid, right?","Technically Studio Ghibli's first feature ('Nausicaä Of The Valley Of The Wind (1984)' preceded it but it also preceded the founding of the studio), this remarkably animated picture tells the tale of a young boy who rescues a young girl he finds falling from the sky, which kicks of a series of events that forces the pair to outwit pirates, soldiers and government agents alike as they all search for a mysterious floating city. Despite a freezing cold open and a relatively quick overall pace, 'Laputa: Castle In The Sky (1986)' doesn't fully kick into gear until just under an hour in when the search for the castle in the sky really starts to get underway. After this point, the thing somehow seems to move much faster and it becomes rather compelling. It's packed full of action, all of which is exciting and visually engaging. There's hardly a dull moment, to be honest. It's an entertaining experience throughout. Plus, it really is gorgeous to look at. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Life-changing genius,"Fans of anime, listen up. This is the film that challenged AKIRA in my top five and may well have won.

"LAPUTA - CASTLE IN THE SKY (Hayao Miyazaki, 1986) ***","As I was about to write this, I decided to re-read my review of Miyazaki's HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE (2004) - which I watched earlier this year - and I realized that what I had said about that film pretty much applies to this one as well, even if there's practically a 20-year gap between them (I guess the inference here is that this celebrated animator's style hasn't developed all that much in the interim, which is not necessarily a bad thing).To quote myself, then: ""a great showcase of the Japanese master's visionary genius; however, it also features his typical faults - to me, at least - of presenting an over-ambitious (and overly weird) plot line which, due to its excessive length, tends to overstay its welcome and ends up in being an overwhelming (if not necessarily memorable) visual experience! As usual, the detail is immaculate and the scale of the whole thing impressive"". Granted, the plot of LAPUTA isn't nearly as involved as some of Miyazaki's later work, though this is still far from a kiddie film - particularly in its climactic set-piece, where all parties concerned (the children, the sky pirates - whose hard exterior mellows gradually to reveal an essential softness underneath - and the army - whose leader, too, isn't what he seems to be) converge on the titular flying citadel, each having their own goal. It's evident, therefore, that characterization is not at all one-dimensional (though Miyazaki dispenses with anthropomorphism this time around) - while the robotic guardians of the island castle are strikingly designed, as well as suitably imposing; the score (by frequent Miyazaki collaborator Joe Hisaishi), too, emerges as a definite asset.To tie in with how I began this review, then, I believe that it's been my over-exposure to Anime on Italian TV as a kid which has diluted the overall impact that such feature-length efforts (and Miyazaki's films in particular) seem to have - pretty much unanimously - on audiences from other parts of the world...",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Nine minutes of magic; then what?,"Let's talk about the first Studio Ghibli movie, Castle in the Sky (1986). It's a foundational piece, sure, but every time I think about it, I just can't shake that sour taste from my mouth.The movie starts fine. Pazu and Sheeta are these wide-eyed adventurers. They're scrappy, earnest, and their chemistry is endearing. But as the story moves along, the hollowing effect widens. It's hard to pinpoint at first. Maybe it's the villain, Muska, whose whole thing is being a ""stock bad guy."" He's power-hungry, sure, but where's the meat on that bone? There's no complexity to him. He's evil because the movie needs him to be. Compared to a character like Lady Eboshi in Miyazaki's later film Princess Mononoke (1997), of whom balances industrialization with a genuine care for her people, Muska feels replaceable.And the themes? I mean, they're there. Like many Miyzakaki movies we have technological advancements versus nature. But that's just it, they are JUST there. The film wants to talk about humanity's hubris and the dangers of self-indulgent ambition, but it never really throws you more than a bone. Instead, it opts for a more visual approach, albeit stunning. The airships, the sky, the crumbling ruins of Laputa, they're all gorgeous. But beauty alone only takes you so far.Then there's the castle itself. When Pazu and Sheeta finally arrive, those nine minutes of exploration are everything I wanted this movie to be. There's a real ethereal feeling to it all, an earnest discovery, like stepping into a dream you can't understand. But the magic is over like that, just nine minutes. And the rest of the film can't match that magic. Instead, we're back to explosions, chases, and a villain rambling on and on about power.It's frustrating. Castle in the Sky teases greatness, brushing by you, just a little too late- then you look back just to get a taste of these glimpses where Miyazaki's future brilliance really begins to form. But it never self-actualizes. The movie is safe, sticking to a straightforward tale of good versus evil, where the heroes are unambiguously good and the villains just as unambiguously bad. There's no moral gray.Don't get me wrong, I get why people love this one. It's a main entree at Ghibli's dinner table. But for me? I wanted more.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
My favourite animated film of all time,"Laputa: Castle in the Sky is my favourite animated film and it happens to be my 3rd favourite film of all time. I have seen all 11 of Miyazaki's films and I got to say, this is my favourite by far. I love practically everything about this Anime. The music score, animation, characters, story, humour, creativity and just the sense of adventure and fun are all amazing and create one of the best, if not the best animated film to have ever been made in my opinion. What's also wonderful is the atmosphere. There are some scenes with no dialogue, but the music, animation and the scenery allows you to take in the mystery and wonder that the film and the world it's created has to offer. Castle in the Sky has everything you could want in a film. Even if you don't like Anime, you have to see this film!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Miyazaki Masterpiece,"I am a huge fan of Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki, and I have been anxiously awaiting the Disney dub of this film. Luckily, I recently saw a subtitled version at a museum and let me say, it's a great movie. Like all of Miyazaki's films, you expect one thing you get another, but you are never disappointed. The film focuses on Pazu, who into his arms falls Sheeta, who holds the power to Laputa, the castle in the sky. They are chased by government agents and pirates (who they later befriend). It's a thrill ride the whole way through, and it's a wonderful movie. The visuals are amazing, and you have to give a ton of credit to the animators. The script is solid and the film is surprsingly funny, there is a lot of humor. So when Disney releases this one sometime in 2000, don't miss it!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of my favourite Studio Ghibli films!...,"Another in my mini-series of Studio Ghibli films and one I have loved for many years, since I first saw it in fact. I think it is because there is an element of science fiction in this one that doesn't seem to feature a lot in many of the other films I've seen from this studio. If I have one criticism, it's that it's a little too long, but then again it's always interesting and the story does move along at a reasonable pace, so it's not all bad. I'll give you more of my thoughts after this brief summary.A girl, Sheeta, has been taken from her home and is being transported by the army and some mysterious men in dark glasses. When their airship is attacked by pirates she retrieves a mysterious stone from one of the men and jumps from the craft. As she approaches land a light comes from the stone and her fall is slowed. She is seen by a boy, Pazu, who catches her and takes her home with him. Pazu's father had snapped a photo of a mysterious castle in the sky, Laputa, and the following day Sheeta tells him her story and how she has a link to this place. The pirates have tracked her, they are looking for her in the village and a chase ensues. Eventually she is captured, not by the pirates, but by the army! A giant robot, help from the pirates, all kinds of flying machines later and Pazu has her free, but can they find Laputa before the army can, and will it be what they expect when they get there? Well, I guess I can't tell you that here or the Spoiler Police will be sending me aloft in an airship (& no parachute) again.I watched this film in the original Japanese (with subtitles) although I believe there is a dubbed version available for those that fear the written word on the screen. It's beautifully animated and stands up well 25 years later. The performances are all good and so honourable mentions must go to the voice talents of; Mayumi Tanaka as Pazu and Keiko Yokozawa as Sheeta. They both gave their characters a lot of life and urgency that was well reflected in the visuals.I love the plot of this film; it starts quite big and just gets bigger! You think you have an idea where it's going, but then it takes a turn and what they come up with is even better than anything I could have thought of! I must admit I would maybe have changed a couple of things, but over all it's quite an excellent piece of work. It's all excellently done, if a little long, and I think the filmmakers stuck to what they do best; telling a good story. You may be able to guess by now, but this one comes pretty highly RECOMMENDED from me.My score: 8.6/10.IMDb Score: 8.1/10 (based on 30,528 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 94/100 (based on 17 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

A fun and refreshing animated adventure movie,"Hayao Miyazaki's Castle in the Sky is one of the director's best films to date. The story revolves around a girl with a magic stone around her neck who falls from the sky into a mining town. The magic stone breaks her fall and she lands in the arms of a young boy. After discovering they are both orphans, the boy shows the girl a photo his dad took of a lost city in the sky called Laputa. After being pursued by pirates, the children discover the true properties of the magic stone. However, the girl is shortly after kidnapped by the government, who are searching for Laputa to harness its mystical powers.One of my favorite things about this movie is how there are two separate (groups of) antagonists: the pirates, led by a highly-entertaining old woman with pink hair and a muscular build, and the government, who have a much more powerful arsenal and end up being the real threat to the children (and the world). The chemistry between the three groups makes for a fun, well-balanced cast of characters.The animation, as in all of Miyazaki's films, is breathtaking. The music, although admittedly dated and somewhat cheesy by today's standards, fits perfectly with the story and visual elements. Miyazki's characters are both creative and believable, which is not always easy to accomplish. As opposed to his other films, Castle in the Sky does not feature mythical or fictional creatures.Above all, this movie incites a sense of adventure. While it may not be the most suitable option to show to small children (it has a few scenes where characters use guns and grenades), it is basically a film for the whole family. The storyline, for the most part, is pretty easy to follow. This is a memorable, heartwarming film, and I am sure I will watch it again.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Even better than Raiders of the Lost Ark,"This is it people: the best adventure film ever made. The film combines all the good qualities of the Indiana Jones films with greater dramatic deepness, a vastly superior soundtrack, composed by Joe Hisaishi, for me the best film composer ever and a more complex story than the simplistic stories of the Indy films (though, by no means, it is a very complex film).While the main characters are 12-year old kids, one could argued that this film is indeed more adult than the Indy films, as it is handled on a more serious tone and has also a serious underlying message, though not as remotely as serious as Nausicaa.The film also has a massive amount of ""cool stuff"", such as the technological marvels shown and the incredible quality of the action sequences.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Yet another Miyazaki masterpiece (surprise),"It almost sounds demeaning to call this one of the most enjoyable animated films I've ever seen; it is, in fact, one of the most enjoyable films of any kind I've ever seen. Anyone familiar with the work of Miyazaki will find a lot of familiar territory here: the rural setting, the preoccupation with aircraft, the mythic themes. What separates this (along with the hilarious ""Porco Rosso"") is its playful brand of movie-serial cliffhanger action.

"Extraordinary, exciting, and with levels of meaning behind it","I find it incredibly annoying when I'm watching a supposedly ""exciting"" film and I can see what's going to happen. A particularly bad example was the supposed SF horror-thriller ""Pitch Black"" when it was possible to work out who was going to be eaten next just by reading the names from the cast list in reverse order: those who had the biggest parts survived longest. ""Laputa: Castle In The Sky"" manages to be far more exciting and far less predictable, and does it all without foul language, explicit violence, or the kind of criminal superman Hollywood has loved ever since ""The Silence of the Lambs"". It would be too complicated for small children, but it's eminently suitable for adults as well as teenagers. As usual with Miyazaki's work the characters were well-rounded and believable, and that helped to keep me guessing as to what was going to happen next. I was on the edge of my seat right until the end. It need hardly be said that the film is visually striking too: perhaps the most astonishing of the Ghibli films I have seen, with the vast perspectives of Slagg's Ravine, houses clinging to the edge, the huge and strangely beautiful city of Laputa, the sullen fort which reaches up into the clouds, and the weird flying machines that are the ""Goliath"" and the ""Tiger Moth"". From an SF point of view it might be loosely categorised as steampunkit's set in an alternative past with high technologybut it is a thrilling, well-written, beautiful film well-leavened with humour which I would recommend to anyone who enjoys imagination.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Yet another Miyazaki triumph,"This is the 4th Miyazaki film I have seen so far (the others were ""Kiki's Delivery Service"", ""Spirited Away"", and ""Princess Mononoke""). All I can say is that the man is a genius. This one is slightly different from his other films in that it leans more towards sci-fi than fantasy ... also, for the most part the focus of the animation is on architecture and structures, whereas most of his films are more about nature (though there are some beautiful natural scenes, especially later in the film). The animation is superb as usual, and the soundtrack is arguably the best of any of the aforementioned films. But the best thing about this movie is the strength of the character relationships; the true love and friendship between Pazu and Sheeta is one the most beautiful and heart-warming things I have EVER seen on film ... (also, the character 'Uncle' provides a rough prelude to one of the best characters in ""Spirited Away"", Kamagi the boiler-man); the character depth in this film also provides stark contrast to the dark, story-and-message focus of ""Princess Mononoke"" (probably my favourite Miyazaki film). Overall, this is another simply superb Miyazaki film - another true animated classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Impressive, but not a masterpiece","The first of the official Ghibli films, Laputa is most similar to its predecessor Nausicaa, but whereas Nausicaa was a SF epic, this is more of an action comedy-adventure with a fairly weak SF premise.For the first half hour of the movie I thought I was going to love it. Once again you find yourself in awe of Miyazaki's attention to detail, and his ability to conjure up an imaginary world in meticulous, beautiful perfection. The animation, though still not in the league of the later Ghibli films, is a little better than in Nausicaa.I mentioned in my review of Nausicaa that one character is drawn in a more 'Lupinesque' anime style. Here there are a whole bunch of them: the pirates. They provide the comic element in the film, though quite why it needs a comic element I'm not sure. There was nothing funny about Nausicaa, and I think it was better off for it. Still. having said that, Dola, the pirate leader, is easily the most memorable character in the film (even if she's basically a female Long John Silver. Don't be surprised if you're reminded of 'Treasure Planet' at times) and is well voiced by Cloris Leachman in the American dub.The English voice cast acquit themselves well for the most part, actually. However something started going pear-shaped for me about this movie by about the halfway mark. I think the best way that I could describe it is that the characters get swallowed up by the vast scope of the story. I'll come back to that later.There is so much to admire about Laputa, and so many people obviously love it, that I almost feel mean for only giving it 8 out of 10, but for me the operative word here is 'admire'. It was more impressive than personally affecting, and at over two hours it just started to drag.The crucial thing for me was this: I really found that I didn't care much about any of the characters. Disney would have taken the care to develop the characters, make you really fall for them, rather than leave them as relatively two-dimensional pieces to be moved around while you gawked at the amazing vistas in the movie. Even that would have been tolerable if there was some hard SF in the story to make up for it, but it was basically a lot of gobledegook about Princesses and magic crystals. That's where Laputa falls down as far as I'm concerned, and that's what holds it back from being a potential 10 out of 10 movie. Having said that, it must be admitted that Miyazaki was leagues ahead of Disney in general in 1986, when you consider that their movie of the same year was the pretty dire 'Great Mouse Detective'.Laputa is a good film in some ways an amazing film, and you should definitely see it, but I do feel it's over-rated. I definitely prefer the earlier 'Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind'.BTW, if you manage to watch them in chronological order, watch for the fox-squirrel from Nausicaa popping up briefly in Laputa.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A wonderfully imaginative and action-packed animated adventure,"This Japanese animation from the creative mind of Hayao Miyazaki is an action-packed adventure. It seems to take place in a version of the early 1900s where aviation technology is very common. Miyazaki's imagination offers us an amazing adventure, with enormous air ships, sky pirates on insectlike speeders, giant robots, courageous characters, some breathtaking scenery, and an ancient floating kingdom.A young girl is being chased by a clan of treasure-seeking pirates as well as government military forces. The girl, in possession of a mysterious stone that holds the secrets of an advanced civilization, meets a heroic young boy who risks everything to protect her. Action waits around every corner. Each sequence seems to open a new gateway of wonder.A great animated adventure. There is some violence, but it should still be a great movie for kids",,Anonymous,Animation
It's fun!,"Only from the opening sequence, I knew that this would be completely different from anything I've seen from Miyazaki. This is not your typical Miyazaki; it's your typical adventure/sci-fi anime film...almost! And this kind of films is not really my cup of tea.The story is by no means special. I felt that I've seen it a hundred thousand times before. The same goes even with the ending that's only unsatisfying because how familiar it is. But one of the things that elevates the story is its nuances and details. This film has story that's extremely rich in details that managed to make me engaged with the story after about 40 minutes of disappointment. Needless to say, there are some deeply meditative lessons and precious messages at the heart of the story.The animation is simply astounding! Actually, I think its even more vibrant and vigorous than in some other later Miyazaki films. Not to mention the creative designs of all the robots and machines that you can only expect to see in this genius's works.I felt that this isn't for me, because it's quite obvious that I didn't enjoy it as much as most people did. I found this a run-of-the-mill adventure story. Still, I had a fun time with Castle in the Sky. I really liked how Miyazaki blends fantasy with science fiction in a way that is reminiscent of Star Wars, and how he the film never lost its dramatic heft despite the non-stop action, which is so good that reminded me of Indiana Jones!(7.5/10)",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
More Miyazaki Loveliness,"I must admit that at first I was a bit disappointed by ""Castle in theSky""; I had ridiculously high expectations for it(that kinda happenswhen you wait for something for a long time) and I was letdown by theEnglish dub- it's just too annoyingly loose, even though the voiceacting is good. However, since I've watched it a few more times(inJapanese with subtitles) I have come to love it just as much asMiyazaki's other movies. There are just so many great things about it:the animation, the gorgeous score, the weird robots, the devoted,innocent love that exists between Pazu and Sheeta etc. So, even thoughthe English dub isn't as up to snuff as the ones for ""Princess Mononoke""or ""Kiki's Delivery Service"", that really doesn't matter too much; youcan always watch the subs and as I have mentioned in other comments: Thelanguage of Miyazaki is universal.

Packed with actions and mild violent scenes (might be not appropriate for younger kids). Not a fan of romance between two kids (sheeta/pazu) and definitely disgusted over the scene where the adults tried to woo sheeta, just because shes beautiful.

"The greatest children's fantasy adventure film ever made - not opinion, fact.","I just realised I've been using IMDb for years now and I've never reviewed my favourite film. By favourite I don't mean something I like for now, I mean this film is so supernaturally perfect that there is never another animated experience going to touch it. This is obvious because I am never going to be a child again; I saw this film on ITV in the early nineties. I was 12 which is the age group this film is directed at, I'm also male, the gender that this film is intended for (the overwhelming majority of Miyazaki's protagonists are female). Consequently this film indelibly inspired my childhood psychology and I am forever indebted to Carl Macek (sp?) for producing the English dub of this film which is far superior to the Di$ney production which is not even funny - I've never even been able to watch that one - of course subtitled is the only way ultimately however the Macek version is SO good (the voices almost exactly corresponding to the original Japanese actors) that this version is available on the Japanese DVD! It's not available on any distribution in an English-speaking country. Go figure.There are hundreds of competent reviews so I'm going to put some trivia here, not that I'm the definitive archive of information for this film.First up I'd like to agree with the reviewer who stated that you need 20 out of 10 to review Miyazaki's films - they are so in their own league that they make almost the whole catalogue on IMDb combined pale into insignificance.The fascinating story with this film is that Miyazaki based the countryside around Slag's Ravine (Pazu's town area) on the Welsh mining communities. He visited Wales for a few months in the early 80s (might be late 70s) just after one of the great mining strikes. Being an avid supporter of the student socialist movements in the sixties he felt their plight. The fight between the townsfolk and the pirates at the beginning serves to illustrate this empathy with the working man. The countryside and the clouds especially in this film remind me of where I grew up as his film depicts a fantasised version of the rolling hills of the midwest British Isles.The island is of course from Swift's genius satirical novel of the eighteenth century - the story in Swift's book is, deliberately, ridiculous. In Castle in The Sky, Miyazaki weaves together myths such as Atlantis and the Tower of Babel - I think the architecture in addition is based on Peruvian ruins though I'm not sure, someone told me that.Anyone who gets round to reading this review and who likes this film REALLY will want to check out Miyazaki's epic series Mirai Shounen Conan - Future Boy Conan - based on the short sci fi novel 'The Incredible Tide' by Alexander key (novel is available online). Conan is basically a prototype for Laputa's Pazu and Shita. In addition you may not be familiar with his earlier work for Masterpiece Theatre - some of his key frame animation.

It is not Miyazaki's best as there are similar remnants to Nausica,"(1989) Castle In The Sky
DUBBED
JAPAN ANIMATION/ FANTASYI originally couldn't get into this film the first time I saw it, but started to like it after my second viewing since the set up is not something I'm usually accustomed to which regards a teenage girl named Sheeta and her crystal pendant. Written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki which the time is during the late 1900's or somewhere along there, and a group of pirates on flying pods with huge insect wings are sabotaging a huge state-of-the-art airplane blimp that looks very futuristically advanced. Anyways, the guy keeping her held up is also bad otherwise, Sheeta would not have knocked him out with a vase and everyone seems to be after her. So she steps out of the blimp and falls making her faint but the pendent she's wearing around her neck saves her by floating her down very gently- similar to what a balloon would do. The boy Pazu is there and catches her and doesn't know what to make of it. We, the viewers are also curious about it's movie's title ""Castle In the Sky"" and what does she as well as her pendent have to do with it, and it regards some mythical legend regarding a castle that's been seen floating around but has never been discovered. Is this legend just a hoax or is it really a reality which regards Sheeta's past. For the movie explains how it may be possible for anything to float in the first place and it has a lot to do with the pendant she is wearing. I thought Anna Paquin did an awesome job with Sheeta but I can't say the same for James Van der Beek voicing for Pazu. Aforementioned, I'm not accustomed to director Miyazaki including very evil characters since I really believe that a leopard can't change his spots and he sort of depends on fate to take care of itself when it would've been better if he doesn't even include any evil characters at all.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
What dreams are made of,"This anime is a pure chef-d'oeuvre. And you can believe a french man saying it. As usual, Miyazaki Hayao brings wonderful drawings, smooth character animation and background pictures have obviously been done with great art and hard work. What makes the difference with any Disney-like anime is the movie-making talent of the Ghibli Studio team. The scenario exists, it has depth and induces reflection. About the hopes of people, their fate, the greed of adults, their lack of imagination and permanent war-making attitude... In the center of the story, 2 children, who fight to find and to preserve Laputa, the flying castle/tree, magnificent and deadly. This movie makes you laugh, think, and it even made me cry (and that's not so frequent). My advice : watch it and go directly to sleep. The movie still runs in your dreams.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
unforgettable fantasy,"This is one of my favorite film by Studio Ghibli. The unique world can only be created by Hayao Miyazaki. The first moment that a girl slowly falls from the sky, in the fantastic sound, audience will be glued to the story. Especially I like the picture of the castle in the sky which spreads after diving into the eye of a storm. I've never seen such an attractive world. The beauty of the picture is one point worthy of note.The story line is quite simple, but suggestively tells something important to us. Varieties of interpretation can be considered. So this animation film is able to entertain not only children but also adults, all generations. I cannot find the worlds but excellent.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Another creation from Miyazaki that will live on forever,"This is the second Miyazaki film I have ever seen and it was a experience I will never forget. I am so grateful that my friend forced me to watch my first anime film (which was Spirited Away) because it got me so addicted that I had to see as many of Miyazaki's films as I possibly could. After Spirited Away I came across Castle in the sky and as I said, it will probably be one of the most memorable experiences of my life. This film captivates you in a way you could never imagine. The way Miyazaki makes his films is like he knows what fascinates everyone. The voice acting in this film is amazing and it makes you feel very connected to the characters and their emotions. Miyazaki's films taught me to do things I wouldn't normally want to do because if you don't, you could be missing out on something amazing. I was taught this because I had absolute no interest in anything anime except for Pokemon, but as I said my friend got me to finally sit down and watch some of Miyazaki's films and to this day I am in their debt as they showed me what real magic is. I recommend EVERYONE to see Castle in the sky, even if you are not a animation fan. I promise that you will be happy that you did. Not only will you witness beautiful drawings and an amazing story, but you will feel like anything in life is possible more then ever. This is only ONE of Miyazaki's MANY beautiful films, so please check them all out as you will be making your heart and soul more happy then you could possibly imagine!!10 STARS OUT OF 10!!!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Even a lesser work of Studio Ghibli is still a masterpiece,"I'm awaiting my AAC (Age Appropriate Critic, 9 year old Sophie)'s review of this, but I will put in my two cents, while I wait. Hayao Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli, changed the world of Anime. It's influences transcended the borders of Japan, and even Disney, a company as American as apple pie, borrows the brilliance of Ghibli. Miyazaki captures both the imagination of a child and the subtle nuances of movement and response unique to childhood. Often the times of greatest brilliance are things happening in the background. Miyazaki waste neither frame nor background character. CASTLE IN THE SKY has all that quality. I watched the version with an American voice cast and the performances were good. The story took awhile to reveal itself, although it began with rapid paced action, which rather set the slower pace for the story amid a plethora of brilliant animation, imagination and characterization. To paraphrase a fellow commentator, although it is not one of my favourite Ghibli story, the lesser in world of Ghibli is still a masterpiece. I give this film an 8 (great) out of 10. {Adventure Anime}",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"This Japanese animated tale of adventure, danger and magic actually happens to be a bit better than average; a rousing and exciting film.","Are there many films that are as flat out exciting, enjoyable, well designed and well-structured as Laputa: Castle in the Sky? In essence, the piece is a B-movie but it's one of those B-movies which happens to throw a dart in generally the right direction only to end up nailing the shot with aplomb. When these sorts of ideas and approaches come off, there is little which doesn't work and Hayao Miyazaki's 1986 animation is one of these: an absolute joy of comedy; fantasy and adventure toying with switching allegiances and imagination in design. I'm a firm believer that animation often works best when it's working with things insurmountable to being ordinarily filmed; a medium which, when applied to cinema, brings to life worlds and people and objects otherwise impossible to create without the need for computer generated imagery to intersperse with the live action. Laputa: Castle in the Sky is one of those films, a project which allows for its creators to just go nuts, although within reason - to do so knowing that they will not be hampered by the potential for effects to overrun creativity and immersion into a fictitious world.There are, of course, instances whereby animated films have tackled ""adult"" issues (ranging from true to life warfare to the toppling of self-possessed alcoholism and grief) in the form of ""Waltz with Bashir""; Franco-Iranian effort ""Persepolis"" through to ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", and have done so rather well, but they were always preoccupied with bringing a visual flourish to worlds that already existed and the period detail (1980's Vienna, Lebanon and 1940's Los Angeles) additionally helped in elevating them above self-indulgent, vacant of substance, spectacle driven pieces. But these are few and far between, and it's not like the Japanese are immune to droll, often unwatchable, animations which blind you with faux-nostalgia and that terrible quasi-sense of magic and merriment abound in pieces such as ""Only Yesterday"" and ""My Neighbour Totoro"", where not an awful lot is happening bar the repetition of steps which had already been taken more rigidly and more enjoyably.Laputa: Castle in the Sky is about a chase and an adventure involving a young, 'farm'-like locale dwelling boy who's propelled into the stratospheres of action, romance and danger. It is, of course, pure escapism but it is charming and it remembers to get the little things right. Opening in an airship flying high in the air above what is later revealed to be the ground below of an alternate Japan on an alternate planet Earth set some time ago, insect-like looking sky bandits invade the affluent surroundings of the vessel in pursuit for a necklace that a young girl surrounded in suited bodyguards is in close contact to. She is Sheeta, a depressed young girl who doesn't feel like eating but is, for some, reason in the company of this small army of men of whom each possess firearms. Amidst the chaos, Sheeta knocks out one of the men guarding her and it's revealed she was, in fact, so fond of their protection that she drops out of the window to fall to what appears to be certain death. Nay, for the item attacked to her necklace has steadied her fall and allowed her to land softly on the grounds below.What she falls into is a rural stretch of land where the young Pazu works, a minor who does the hours and lives simply only to have this Sheeta and her amazing possession come upon his world. Cocksure and boisterous, he is not deterred from maintaining his whipper-snapper attitude in spite of a peer chastising him for something. With Sheeta, Pazu, who's a sort of epitome of the working class man in boy form, embark on this adventure with the elements from before chasing them as they strive to uncover the secrets of the necklace whose purpose is to lead them to the eponymous kingdom in the sky: Laputa. The film's setting, stuck somewhere between the industrial age and a futuristic Utopia wherein rocket propelled jet skis are designed within an inch of their lives, but when a motorcar shows up can only induce reactions of ""You don't see those very often(!)"", allows perfectly for a rounded; neo-fantastical locale wherein grounded and recognisable characters and attitudes may exist hand in hand with escapist content.One looks past the film's tendency to depict its lead as an all-conquering, all saving epitome of leftist industrial liberalism – a character whose decision to aid an outsider arriving unexpectedly in a locale alien to them (although familiar and functioning to the lead) very much leads them to a higher and more spiritual plateau of adventure and discovery. Moreover, and where the idea that factory floor/steel mill/coal mine (delete as appropriate) dwelling leftists can vanquish enemies and embrace this new found intruder is inherent, one should look past apparent 'pro' annotations to what waves of Left-induced immigration spins on those already occupying the land, and instead focus on the fact Laputa: Caslte in the Sky is more of a cracking, gratifying action film with a lot of amusing second unit material that works a whole lot more than it should.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

A few rough edges but still a magical film from Miyazaki,"I should perhaps begin by saying that this film was my introduction to Miyazaki, although his reputation preceded him. Even in this early directorial effort there is a sense of a genuine artist at work.""Castle in the Sky"" centers on the pursuit of a young girl whose crystal necklace holds the power to guide the way to Laputa, a mystical castle afloat in the clouds. After initially escaping her would-be captors she is befriended by a young boy. Together they join forces to escape the clutches of pirates and the military, each of whom have their own motives for locating Laputa.The story is refreshingly imaginative and is thankfully devoid of Disney's usual blatant moralizing. I should note that it was the Disney release that I watched, replete with English dubbing. The voice cast didn't seem extremely well-chosen but it wasn't that bad overall. A bigger distraction was the score, which I was unsurprised to learn was greatly expanded at Disney's request. Not only does it insert music where none was needed, it seemed to me to be too prominent in the overall audio mix.However, these are fairly minor quibbles which will easily be overshadowed as you become wrapped up in the story (and the wonderful visuals). It certainly made me anxious to see more from Studio Ghibli.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Anime at its very best,"I watched Laputa for the first time in the 80s when I was still a child, but now watching it when I'm an adult really put things into perspective. The plot is very well written, but the characters' development is what contributes to the story's overall excellence. If you seek an anime capable of captivating your heart, Laputa is the one to get. This is one of those films that you do not fast forward for there are no boring scenes. Not a film for people that seek a hidden message behind every movie, but rather one you can rent to watch with your girl/man or family on a night in.Not recommended for children under 7, since they will not appreciate the plot nor should they pick up a rock and jump off the roof trying to float.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Definitely a must see. Miyazaki has another great story here.,I've seen the original English version on video. Disney's choice of voice actors looks very promising. I can't believe I'm saying that.

The animation quality is excellent! If you've seen Disney's job of Kiki's delivery service you can see the quality in their production.

Miyazaki has done it again.,"This film has you hooked from the beginning. Everything about it is up to the standards that have come to be expected from renowned animator Haiyo Miyazaki. The pacing of the movie is excellent, the characters unique (specificly the pirates), the musical score riveting, and the animation very well done. The voice talent behind this film also blew me away, everyone from Oscar Winner Anna Paquin, Dawson's Creek Star Josh Van Der Beek, Mark Hamil, and Andy Dick lent their voices to this stunning production. In addition to it being an overall amazing film, it is devoid of cursing and any heavy violence, but the action is still fresh, making this a movie for the entire family. Rent this immediately, and then after you are convinced that what I am saying is true, buy it. It will make the perfect addition to your DVD collection, and is a good place to start your Miyazaki film collection.

Laputa: Castle in the Sky is a near perfect Ghibli debut from the master of anime himself.,"You know what, they just don't make adventure films like these anymore. I never get that sense of wonderment, awe or anything that stimulates my cerebral cortex that holds my imagination. There's only one person I can rely on, Hayao Miyazaki. A young boy encounters a mysterious girl who has fallen from the sky. He is then entangled in a fantastical adventure to which they must travel to the mythical floating castle of Laputa in order to prevent its true power falling into the wrong hands. Straight off the bat, the animation is stunning. Yet again, every frame just looks like a piece of art. Elegant, ethereal and energetic. The attention to detail never fails to astound me. It evokes pure imagination and creativity that appeals to both mature and younger audiences. Sky pirates, floating islands, sentient ancient guardians and a small dosage of magic. That is the beauty of animation, and Japanese studios know this best. There are no limits to one's creativity and artistic integrity. Miyazaki co-founding Studio Ghibli allowed him to explore his range of concepts and give him freedom to his work. The script contained both heartfelt emotion and sporadic comedic moments that will bring both smiles and character investment. Our main protagonists were adorable, I ship them! Plenty of action and perilous tasks that heightened the tension. Laputa itself was just beautiful, it's clear that many fantasy films and video games took elements from the design of Laputa. The pacing was practically perfect, it's just a shame the ending was incredibly rushed! I literally shouted ""Noooo! You were so close to getting a 10/10!"". But alas, Laputa is Miyazaki's adventure animation that showcases his best talents. Oh, and the musical score...damn, t'was good.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Maybe too 'typical' of Miyazaki's work to be appreciated on its 'atypical' level...,"""Castle in the Sky"" is the eighth Hayao Miyazaki I discover and discover is the word, because despite the patterns you start noticing from one film to another, each one carries a mark of uniqueness like a sacred crystal amulet of its own.And the more I see his work, the more routinely (I must confess) my amazement grows. I don't even watch them in chronological order and it doesn't affect my judgments, ""Nausicaa"" looked more accomplished than ""Porco Rosso"" or ""Kiki"" and while not being as sophisticated as ""Mono-noke"", ""Ponyo"" hit a more sensitive chord. Now, what can I say about ""Castle in the Sky"" without being taken in a maze of hackneyed and boring superlatives? Let me think a littleWell, I'll borrow a compliment Roger Ebert made about Wes Anderson, which I think applies perfectly for Myazaki: the Japanese master's mind would be a wonderful place to visit, it seems that even animated frames are too limited, too small a space to carry all the expansive range of ideas that can flourish out of his imagination. ""A Castle in the Sky"" is only his third animated feature and yet it is so close to an unprecedented level of animated perfection even on the field of storytelling, it is so rich your own mind can lose track.I guess I could have said the same about ""Nausicaa"", you've got to wonder how he managed to outdo himself one film after another, and he hadn't made ""My Neighbor Totoro"" yet. Still, I can see in ""Totoro"" or even ""Kiki Delivery Service"", a desire to get back to a simpler story-line, and not to my displeasure because this is the kind of plot I enjoy more in Miyazaki. ""Castle in the Sky"" is nothing short of a masterpiece but I have a soft spot for his character-driven movies. Miyazaki is never as hypnotic and impressive when his frames are more in states of contemplation, as if they were in an awe of their own material.Of course, action is outstanding, and Miyazaki had already demonstrated that he mastered the sky as the background to thrilling fights and chases, showcasing a level of dedication that only Disney movies can compete with (barely) but Miyazaki, the spiritual man, the poet, is so capable of transcending the limits of action that some parts from ""Castle in the Sky"" are too unsurprising especially since they came after ""Nausicaa"". To be fair though, there's more to enjoy than a series of chases in the air starting with the heroine. I loved the way the character of Sheeta didn't duplicate the ""Nausicaa"" model, she's not a fighter but a simple girl who hides a secret, symbolized by a mysterious amulet.And even the revelation about her regal ancestry doesn't turn her into some kick-ass heroine. Miyazaki doesn't insult his audience's intelligence, while Nausicaa had her skills from the start, Sheeta is really caught in a coming-of-age narrative. The second character Pazu, a boy working in a mine factory, is eager to follow her, embodying the adventurous spirit of childhood (he's like Fio in ""Porco Rosso"" and Tombo In ""Kiki"") but his lack of experience makes him commit some blatant mistakes in judgment, he's just a kid after all. As a matter of fact, even the big bad pirates from the start are only kids when confronted to their bossy and experienced mother Dola, who's like a mixture between Ma Baker, Agnes Skinner, Grandma Addams and Captain Hook.I loved all the peripheral characters... from those who brought up the comedic element the film would have severely lacked to Uncle Pomme who provided the obligatory Miyazaki moment of meditation of the virtues we should all treasure from Earth. Miyazaki has covered the sky, the sea and the earth, he's indeed the most environmentalist director ever and ""Castle in the Sky"" combines the idea of earth with the spiritual elevation through the castle of Laputa, a legendary city whose name was borrowed from Gulliver's Travel and that used to rule over the world and incarnate the boundless ambition of men. The antagonist, Prince Muska wants to take a hold of the amulet to be the Earth new ruler.He's helped by a whole army and a giant robot who reveals the first inspiration of Miyazaki, French masterpiece ""The King and the Mockingbird"", which could have been called ""Castle in the Sky"".The film belongs to the complex realm of Miyazaki's stories, with so many layers you've got to keep yourself pretty focused to enjoy it. In fact, it's perhaps the one flaw I can concede to this particular film, it requires a certain conscience of the inspiration, understanding before enjoyment, and two hours of such deep and rich writing might be too difficult for younger audiences. I'm not implying that this is a film aimed for children as it provides a sweet and a nice friendship story between a boy and a girl so it would be a shame if children missed that story.Miyazaki has always been an expert when it came to concoct mixtures of mature and inspiring material. This time, the film flies in many directions before we can identify the main plot line, and there are a few disorienting changes of tone. It's all visually rich and entertaining but I didn't feel as engaged as in the previous movies, if not the best Miyazaki, it was probably the one with the best potential. Which might explain why there's another Miyazaki named ""Howl's Moving Castle"".",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Studio Ghibli's First Venture,"1985 was the year Studio Ghibli was formed by legends Hayao Miyazaki, Isao Takahata, Toshio Suzuki and Yasuyoshi Tokuma. A year later, they released their first ever feature length film, Laputa: Castle in the Sky (or just Castle in the Sky internationally). The film went on to garnish critical acclaim and a huge cult following amongst fans of Miyazaki's work. Needless to say, based on my love and appreciation for this man's work, I deem it as one of his best.The general story follows the adventures of a young boy named Pazu and a girl named Sheeta who possesses a mysterious stone with the ability of levitation. In addition to keeping the crystal away from military agents, they embark on a quest to search for a legendary floating castle called Laputa. With that said, Pazu and Sheeta make an adorable couple of friends, as their chemistry with each other is very sweet but also heart wrenching given what circumstances come about to them. Both are determined to find this lost castle to rediscover its lost beauty, and it's really nice how they develop within the pirates they meet.Speaking of said pirates, Dola's gang may seem antagonistic at first, but they're actually a genuinely entertaining and bittersweet gang, as they mold into one of the funniest family duos ever displayed in film. As for the real antagonist Colonel Muska, he is extremely hellbent on recovering Laputa for his own selfish and diabolical reasons, and therein lies possibly the film's biggest theme of all. You can use whatever weapons and machinery to get your way, but no matter what, love and nature are what matter most and taking them for granted does more harm than good.In addition, the setting that emulates 19th century Europe really gives the film a strange albeit wonderful contrast between the prosperous town Pazu is from to the much more spectacular castle altogether. Even for their first ever feature, the animation really is astonishing, especially the usage of aircraft and clouds breaking up. The moments where the characters are in the air make one feel the sense of high open space, and the atmosphere around really makes one's jaw drop. It's great when the world building can sometimes steal the show from the actual cast.If there are criticisms I do have, it's that while Dola's sons are entertaining in their own regard, the whole sub arch with them falling in love with Sheeta is rather pointless. It doesn't show up again after a couple of scenes and it actually gives a somewhat creepy feel to the movie. Also, while the Disney English dub is by no means bad, there is a little too much dialogue sprinkled throughout. It doesn't help that there are points that should be silent that are filled with annoying banter and out of place comedy. I'm yet to see the original dub, but I hope it's much better.Overall, Castle in the Sky remains as the kickstarter to what would eventually become the most beloved Japanese animation studio of all time. The characters are extremely lovable and worth rooting for, the animation is nothing short of gorgeous, and the themes of prospering through nature over political action and violence are just as relevant today as they were back then. If you are yet to see this film, definitely give it a watch to see where the studio that brought us Totoro, Spirited Away and Princess Kaguya originally blossomed. It's an experience for the whole family, and one that I'm happy to rewatch after so many years.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Studio Ghibli's best movie,"Most animated movies that come out are pretty good. Not all of them are perfect, but you'd be surprised how many good ones there are. But there's one that in my opinion, is the definitive one. The one that stands out above all. That movie is Hayao Miyazaki's Castle in the Sky.In a different time period or world, there exists a legend of a floating castle named Laputa. Only few people have heard or seen it. One of them is a boy named Patzu, an adventurous thirteen year old kid who's father was obsessed with the castle after he took a picture of it. He is determined to find the castle and prove justice for his father.At the same time, the princess of the Laputa, a girl named Sheeta, is kidnapped by a goverment agent named Muska who wants her amulet that is the key to a secret room on Laputa. As Muska is taking her away, a group of pirates hijack the ship and try to take the amulet from her. She climbs outside of the blimp and accidentally falls before they can get her. Her amulet saves her from falling and she gently glides down to a mysterious location. Patzu discovers her and takes care of her.From then on, it turns into a full on adventure movies complete with robots, evil corporations, fighting, and the discovery of Laputa.Watching this movie is like an experience. Something that takes you away from reality and puts you in this fantasy realm. When I first watched this movie, everything on screen that Studio Ghibli did, they did right. The animation, the music, the voice acting, the plot, and the resolution.James Van Der Beek and Anna Paquin do fantastic jobs as both Patzu and Sheeta. So does Cloris Leachman as the main pirate. But the person that steals the show is Mark Hamill as Muska. Mark Hamill is a definitive villain. Just hearing his voice when he's threatening Sheeta gives me chills. This is probably his best performance since The Joker from Batman the Animated Series.Hayao Miyazaki and his team did a really good job creating the world and Laputa. You could probably take any frame from this movie and hang it on your wall. Just the way they put so much detail into Laputa is a real treat.If you're looking for an adventure movie that is also an anime, has fantastic characters and of course and original story, then what are you doing reading my review. Go watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Love without hesitation,"Sometimes I feel like a robot soldier standing in front of a tombstone with long arms hanging from it, watching over this civilization abandoned by humans until the last moment, watching its own city decline and collapse, watching its companions' corpses wither and grow in vines, watching Sida come and go, lonely and lonely. Sometimes I feel that the power of nature is giving new vitality to this place. The fish swimming in the underwater city, the grass and trees near the clouds, the last robot soldiers are gentle and kind. They save the bird's eggs under the kite, the big bird returns home, and their footsteps are firm. They come to the big tree and offer flowers to it. Their companions are covered in moss, some nourish new life, and some merge with the big tree. They pick a flower and pass it through the light and shadow to Sida, It is covered in moss, and small animals are playing on its shoulders, not lonely at all. Even if Sida leaves in the end, it is also playing with butterflies and birds on its own.The final collapse and cessation of the Sky City were just right. Hidda and Baru wanted to protect Lapda like fools, and the roots also protected them. They were free from the civilization, greed, and desires imposed by humans, and Lapda became pure and light. Robot soldiers were no longer weapons, but guards.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of Miyazaki's best,"I've always found myself more of a mild fan of Miyazaki's films than most seem to be. I haven't come close to disliking any of them, and as far as numerical ratings go, I've given all of them 7s or 8s out of 10. I know this could be a somewhat controversial opinion, and I respect that it might be a cultural thing, being less well-versed in Japanese traditions and mythology, which I'm sure Miyazaki implements into all his movies. They're often uniquely Japanese affairs, and perhaps a greater knowledge of that country and its favourite storytelling themes and styles would help me love his films rather than merely like them a lot.All that being said, there are absolutely aspects of his movies that can be appreciated by everyone, regardless of their culture or knowledge of Japan. I'm sure this is what has ensured Miyazaki and numerous other Studio Ghibli films to get the sort of international attention and acclaim they've gotten over the past few decades. Most obviously, all are absolutely beautiful to look at, with spectacular use of colour and traditional, hand-drawn animation. The music is always excellent too, and the worlds created are fascinating, engaging, visceral, and occasionally quite haunting.All these positive qualities can be attributed and then some to 1986's Castle in the Sky. This movie is staggering to look at and listen to, and it's beyond impressive that this movie is over thirty years old yet still looks as great as it does. I believe if this movie were released in cinemas today, people would still rave about the animation and visuals, even if they were under the impression that it was a brand new movie. The music is as good as you'd expect from a Miyazaki film, and the world is absolutely gorgeous. It's worth watching the film just for that experience of seeing this place that Miyazaki and his animation team have painstakingly created.Thankfully, many of my extremely subjective/ perceived shortcomings with some of Miyazaki's other films aren't issues here. Sometimes I feel like his films aren't terribly engaging when it comes to story or characters, which Castle in the Sky gets around by having what I thought to be a faster pace, and more general excitement and tension than some of his other films. Emotionally I wasn't as moved as I may have wanted to be, which is something that I have found with all his films I've seen so far. The visuals and score are often emotional in a way, on their own, but not so much the struggles of the characters, and here, I was somewhat invested, but not enough to make me unconditionally love the movie. I don't know why this is, but it's something I find with Miyazaki a lot of the time. Maybe it's a cultural thing, or maybe it's just emotions being subjective, but either way, when the film is still mostly well-paced and consistently beautiful, it isn't a huge problem. There are very few parts where the film truly drags, and it has a satisfying conclusion that makes all 125 minutes more than worth sitting through.To my knowledge, Castle in the Sky isn't always regarded as classic Miyazaki, but in my opinion it should be. I thought this was on the same level quality-wise as the more widely celebrated Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, and as such, would highly recommend this to anybody who may have watched and enjoyed those while overlooking this one. It's a fantastic technical achievement from an animation perspective, and another good reason why Miyazaki has become such an adored figure within the filmmaking world.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Masterpiece of Animation,"Castle in the Sky (1986) is one of director and writer, Hayao Miyazaki's first films, however it is still set in his fantasy world. In a land containing fantastical air ships and magical pendants, Sheeta (Anna Paquin) and Pazu (James Van Der Beek) find themselves on the run from highly incompetent and whimsical pirates, being led by their mother (Cloris Leachman), and the government, led by the mysterious Muska (Mark Hamill).Once again Miyazaki proves why he is one of my favorite directors. His use of animation to create an entirely new fantastic world takes the audience out of their seats and leaves them elated and yearning for more.

A great kickoff for Studio Ghibli,"The story and characters of Castle in the Sky (1986) are not wholly original: Miyazaki had already told a story of a plucky boy and a girl with mysterious power against a corrupt villain out to resurrect ancient, apocalyptic technology in his TV series, Future Boy Conan (1978). However, both the world and the characters of CitS are more fleshed out than their TV counterparts.The world-building is phenomenal, a fantastical 19th century world of giant airships and floating islands. It would not surprise me if this film has inspired many a steampunk novel or movie.The animation and backgrounds are superb. The music is equally haunting and whimsical. The characters are so likable, the themes of technology and corruption still relevant. The film is fun and full of action, but there are also meditative moments and poignancy.Overall, Studio Ghibli could not have gotten a better start than with this charming fantasy-adventure.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Castle in the Sky Is Captivating, Suspenseful, and Visually Stunning","Castle in the Sky is my favorite animated movie of all time. Everything about it, the animation, the story, the music, the characters, the aesthetic, the writing, the world, it's all perfect!It's the studio's first official film, made nearly 50 years ago, but it still holds up really well, although the animation may be inferior to what some companies produce nowadays. Castle in the Sky has this unique charm to it that I can't quite explain. In every single scene in the movie, even the parts where disaster is happening, the frames manage to be visually pleasing and beautiful. Sheeta and Pazu are admittedly far from the best protagonists I've seen in a film, but they're still fun to watch. It's also one of the few Studio Ghibli productions to have a genuine villain, that being Colonel Muska. He's despicable, cunning, and steals every scene he's in. The sky pirates, agents, and the army add to the movie as well.All 125 minutes of this movie, from when Sheeta first escapes the airship to the destruction of Laputa, I never feel bored. I can't explain in words how much I adore this film. Miyazaki is a genius of animation.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Another lovely Studio Ghibli cartoon,"In some ways, this is a classic tale. A lost princess meets a village boy, a ruthless baddie searches for power, friends who help the good guys overcome the odds, and a happy ending. But it is so much more three-dimensional and original than that. There are also enchanted rocks, robots, military fortresses, and a devastating weapon that destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah! Studio Ghibli again weaves the mundane with the magical and throws in the usual mix of interesting characters for the journey. The main characters are innocent youngsters but that's what makes it heartwarming. The themes of friendship, love and nature are beautifully illustrated here too.I don't know how much the new Disney version has altered the dialogue, but certainly at times it did seem inappropriately saccharine or blunt. Also I should say I really liked the main theme (used in the end music too).",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
First true Ghibli film and a testament to its talent,"With the success of Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata were able to found Studio Ghibli, and this was their first official feature film. And what a great film it was and still is, having withstood the test of time remarkable well. Inspired by Jonathan Swift's novel Gulliver's Travels, it's a tale about a world that has fallen into ruin after a golden age - a common theme with Miyazaki - and the miracles of yesterday have become legends and myths. Including Laputa, the eponymous castle in the sky. Yet there are still those that search for it.In a lot of ways, this is a very good introduction into films directed by Miyazaki. It's a relatively simple story, yet it keeps you hooked from the very first scene. It's very kid-friendly, but has deeper themes and even a few dark scenes. The characters are both memorable and identifiable. Pretty much all of them are the kind of people you would like to know and have along on an adventure - with the exception of one or two, but we'll get to them in a moment. And it has flying machines, industrial revolution -inspired populations, gorgeous animation, hauntingly beautiful music, great action scenes, all that good stuff.Yet I would still rank this amongst my least favourite Miyazaki films. (And yeah, I'm still giving this a nine out of ten. The man's that good.) The reason for that is the fact I think the villain's a bit weak. The character design isn't all that interesting, he comes off more pathetic than menacing and he's quite honestly a bit creepy in a way that doesn't match the tone the film is going for. Bad vibes, is all I'm saying. Still, his voice actor does a good job and he has a few good scenes, so I can deal with him. The side villains are a bit on the same boat, but they have less screen time, so they end up on the positive side.But as my rating should indicate, I think this is a very good film. Fun, engaging, beautiful - the perfect kid's film that adults can enjoy as well. Studio Ghibli couldn't have started its career with a better film.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

"There is a Castle on a Cloud, I like to go there in my Dreams","I absolutely love ""Castle in the Sky"". It was thanks to this film that I sought out all of Studio Ghibli's films. There is a lot to love about this film. The animation is beautiful. The music by Joe Hisaishi emits awe and wonder at times. At other times it can be intense and exciting, like you're playing a boss battle in a video game. The music is used sparingly, but when it is used, it perfectly punctuates every emotional beat.The English voice acting across the board is top notch. Everyone from the main character, James Van Der Beek, to additional voices by Scott Menville put in ""A+"" performances. Yes, it does seem like Anna Paquin's British Accent comes and goes, but I find that endearing. Special highlight to Cloris Leachman and Mark Hamill, who are both voice acting legends in my book.Speaking of Mark Hamill, this is one of the only Studio Ghibli films that has a straightforward villain character. Some don't have villains, and others just have morally complex antagonists. But this film has a villain and its a great villain at that. Muska always seems like he is up to something sinister, and when his plans finally unveil themselves, it is awesome. I also love the force of three different antagonists' groups, the army, Muska and the Dola Pirates.Of all the Studio Ghibili films, this one most closely follows what I would consider the basic 3 act story structure. But I don't consider that a bad thing. The story has enough creativity, twists and likable characters that it pulls it off with excellent delivery. This movie would be an excellent starting point for anyone trying to get into anime.Pazu and Sheeta's friendship is the glue that holds this story together. They each have their own motivation for pushing forward, but it is their bond that creates change in themselves and the Dola gang. They build up Pazu's character in a great way, showing us how he is competent, friendly and willing to work. They don't just say, ""I'm into airplanes"" so then in the third act the audience can buy he can fly a plane. They put in a lot of legwork to demonstrate his skills and upbeat nature.This movie also has one of the top 3 best animated openings. It is a terrific cold open that lets the audience know all they need and ask all the questions that keep them hooked. If you need a lesson on how to begin a story, this one is the example to use.I regret that I didn't watch this film when I was growing up, this is the type of film I would have loved as a 10-year old. If you have, or ever have had a childhood, this film should be a lot of fun. And on top of all of that, it has deeper things to say about humanity and nature than your typical ""Kids' Film"".It is over 2 hours long, but never feels like it drags. My only nitpick would be that the cartoon physics through different parts of the film lower the suspense of anything tragic happening. Nothing as cartoonish as what you'd see in the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise.These nitpicks are not allowed.Not in my castle on a cloud.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

They didn't declare their flame, and it is why this story is beautiful : they feel an innocent love for each other.

"A masterpiece - make sure you see the full, Japanese version with subtitles","It's a testament to the problems of translating and dubbing foreign films that this Myazaki classic isn't far more recognised than it is. Check the ratings: over 50% of those who voted for this gave it a 10 (mean score 8.5), but it's adjusted score is much lower. This can only be accounted for by the mode of it's release in America - the film was dubbed and scenes were cut to make it more appealing to a young audience, inevitably losing something given the perfect voice acting, characterisation and pacing of the original. I can't think of an animated film I would place over this, and that includes the entire Disney back catalogue. The music alone is worth the music of any 4 Disney films you care to name (No musical numbers! No Elton John!).In fact, this is probably a film it's best to get an import copy of if you can.

Manga movie at it's best!,"I remember the first time I ever saw this movie in it's uncut original VCR release by chance and didn't realise that I had by sheer luck stumbled upon a piece of manga movie masterpiece. The first thing that came into my mind after viewing this movie as a 12 year old child was it's absolutely stunning animation and breath-taking action. The creators and animators were able to place the viewers literally on screen with the main characters by the use of dynamic camera angles which best captured the action as well as very fine detailed animations, which were best illustrated in the chase scene on the railroads where Pazu and Sheeta who narrowly escapes their captors. But as I grew older so did my impressions of this movie change. What makes Laputa so good were not only for it's action and animations but it's strongest point lies in it's storyline and script which were able to elicit emotions in it's viewers, and the soundtrack compliments this movie superbly. I was about to compare this movie with others in its genre but after careful consideration I don't think there's ever been another manga/cartoon movie that comes close to it. After reading this review I bet you'll all think that I'm pretty bias, but then again isn't everybody who has seen this movie?

Dizzying architecture of the sky...,"(Review of DVD in Japanese with English Subtitles)This is probably the most over-the-top Ghibli film in terms of heavy handed symbolism and hard-to-believe (but thrilling) action sequences.Still, it is an easy 10, since like all of Ghibli's films, if you listen and watch carefully, it stamps an imprint of beauty on your soul which haunts you for days after.In this case the gorgeous and dizzying architecture of the sky, the clouds, and humans teetering on the brink of the abyss is unforgettable.  There also is an enchanting faux-European world of pirates, dirigables, explorers, and miners set against the backdrop of the ancient Atlantis-like Laputa. Except Laputa is in the sky, not the ocean.Like most of Ghibli films its hard to imagine anyone who would not like it except the terminally unimaginative.

If east be English,"The way I discovered Miyazaki's movies was with a bit of surprise and curiosity, something that itself is best depicted in his movies. It was ""Howl's Castle"" that caught my attention while switching channels one Sunday. You can almost always see a sublime English influence in his work- characters with an innocent curiosity exploring a world of immense power and intractable magic. It is intriguing and immersing - a world that I hadn't seen since having read ""Alice in the Wonderland"" in my childhood for the first time. Music and art-direction is crafted very carefully to give an effect rarely achieved by cinema.Castle-in-the-sky is probably one of the best of his works. We revisit Swift's ""Laputa"" from the Gulliver's Travels in the movie – a place far into the unknown that has had a history of the sort of power and intelligence that is unmatched by the modern civilization. The characters of the movie Sheeta and Pazu both find themselves onto an inevitable voyage to Laputa. Their rather exploratory journey to Laputa is full of hurdles and discoveries. As they run into air-pirates, plane-crashes and magical revelations we become a part of their joy, worries, inquisitiveness and amazement.If you're thinking Harry Potter, then you're absolutely mistaken. This might just be the opposite end of the spectrum. The visual effects of the movie are not meant to transcend the limits of the real world by letting you be in a fantasy world of magic and wizardry but instead in a rather unique way to meditate on our being and might in this world, in a way the Gulliver's travel did. That all of it can be achieved through animation is something only Miyazaki can be credited to.One thing that Miyazaki does very well is to not let somewhat sentimental moments in the movie become too sappy or theatrical. The story might have had a tendency to become that way but script kept it entertaining with jokes and ""quirkiness"" of its characters at times. The dubbing artists did a wonderful job in making this movie appear seamlessly ""English"". It would remain rather incomprehensible to me how movies from Far East can be enjoyed without any conscious attempt to overcome cultural boundaries.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Miyazaki at his best, a breathtaking adventure of a film","My conversion to the Miyazaki mind set is now complete. I suspectthis visionary genius, whose talents had rarely been given majoraccess to the average westerner until his glorious Oscar winningSpirited Away, is capable of doing no wrong.Castle In The Sky is a beautifully crafted joyride that reminds youwant its like to be young. The animation is undeniable superb andthe voice cast (of the English dubbed version) well selected.However it is the sheer sense of wonder that gets you. LikeSpirited Away Miyazaki's scale of imagination is extraordinary. Arare talent in adults.For most people as you grow older the mundanities of life run youdown and help to destroy your imagination bit by bit. Some artistsare capable of taping into that childlike imagination andrecapturing some of the wonder and spectacle. I would argue thatin the film world Steven Spielberg, John Lasseter and (representing the slightly more mischievous child) Joe Dante areamong the best at this. Films such as E.T., Toy Story andInnerspace, Indiana Jones, Monsters, Inc. and Gremlins provide alandscape of adventure and fun, unbridled childish excitement.Anyone who's ever enjoyed The Goonies as a child knows whatI'm talking about and still gets nostalgic at a cry of ""hey, you guys""!It's not the same if you experience it as an adult usually. That ispart of the problem with the new Star Wars films. So many peoplewho watched the original trilogy through the wide eyes ofchildhood cannot see the same qualities in the new films unlessthey access their imagination and childlike sense of awe, forgetwhat they know about criticism and technical specifications (likeeffects etc) that they were blissfully unaware of in childhood andlook at these films as if they were a kid again.The wonder of Miyazaki is that he seems not to be accessingchildlike qualities, but genuinely seems to still possess theimagination of a pre-teen. Even more incredible is the way he canchannel this to his audience through his stories and imagery.Castle In The Sky, like Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away and hisother films, contains characters and situations few could conceiveof. I do not want to give anything away of the story as it should beexperienced first hand to truly capture the overwhelming scale andinventiveness.Miyazaki is a genius. Castle In The Sky in superior to PrincessMononoke but falls just short of his masterpiece Spirited Away.Believe John Lasseter see them all. See My Neighbor Totoro,Kiki's Delivery Service etc. Experience them all.

"An enchanting exploration through heart and imagination, Hayou Miyazaki's Castle in The Sky is a spellbinding journey","There are not many filmmakers like Hayou Miyazaki, especially here in the United States. The Japanese animation director and head of Studio Ghibli films has become a household in both the U.S and Japan for crafting motion pictures bound to push the boundaries of imagination since his directorial debut in the late 70s with 'The Castle of Cagliostro', a film that didn't see the light of day in the U.S until a little over a decade later. Castle in The Sky is a breathtaking adventure that dares to explore the indefinite world of heart and imagination, and what comes about Miyazaki's craftmanship is an journey that is by no means a tear-jerker, but an ultimately moving picture with an appeal for both kids, teens, and adults. Whether you are watching the original Japanese version or the English dub, the magic of Miyazaki's directorial hand shines like gold and transcends the picture into something more than your average family-friendly fairy tale. The film follows young teen Pazu (voiced by James Van Deek), an mechanical engineer who witnesses a young girl Sheeta (voiced by Anna Paquin) floating from the sky by the power of a glowing crystal she wears around your neck. When the two find themselves in a crash course between league of pirates lead by the dubious Dola (voiced by Cloris Leachman) and an army lead by a shady general (voiced by Jim Cummings) and the equally shady Muska (voiced by Mark Hamill), each of whom are after Sheeta to claim the crystal; the two youngster set out on a race to a secret temple floating thousands of feet in the sky. Together, they must learn the secret hidden within the mysterious castle.What Hayou Miyazaki proves is that he is not a filmmaker who takes ambition to granted. Every inch of storytelling he carries is poured into the picture with no amount of ambition squander in the slightest. And the magic of his efforts shine through nearly every frame. Blending elements of high-classed fantasy and science-fiction with a potent touch of human drama, this beautifully animated film hits the right notes from beginning to end, and the excitement upheld in every scene following the introduction of our young characters dares to leaves us gripped. When young protagonist Paza and his newly found friend Sheeta unexpectedly find themselves cross paths with a group of shady individuals and corrupt army officials, tension almost immediately takes hold and set the story in a sleek, solidly-paced motion. And as the story strolls along, an absorbing humanity within the two characters grows; and that combined with the voiced performances by James Van Deek and Anna Paquin are the leading aspects of the character's winning over the hearts of audiences. Although the story is nothing necessarily revolutionary, Miyazaki proves capable of crafting a plot with complex layers mixed with biblical symbolism which is more than likely to fly over children's heads; and that is only part of the whimsical magic lying within the director's grandeur.Castle in The Sky is a spellbinding journey of spectacular proportions, and definitely what earns the title of an outstanding achievement in Japanese animation. Whether you are a child, teenager, or an adult, there is something truly magical to be experienced in this adventure, something that many animated pictures are less than likely to uphold. For what Miyazaki accomplishes here, this is not far from the heights of a blistering masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fantastical adventure,"Castle in the Sky is a fantastical adventure that's filled with all the classic Miyazaki preoccupations. Most noticeably how mankind can't be trusted with advanced technology because they'll only twist it into something destructive. The fact that this is nearly 40 years old is astonishing, Miyazaki's work ages so gracefully.Keiko Yokozawa and Mayumi Tanaka are amazing together. The adventure they embark on has real wonder as well as sadness to it and both of their performances are able to communicate all of that wonderfully. Keiko Yokozawa in particular makes a character who could've just been a plot device so much more.Hayao Miyazaki's direction blends various eras of history here for a world that feels so unique and engrossing to be in. Tonally, he is a master of balance as the film mostly remains lighthearted with great slapstick humour but there are moments where it goes to much darker territory and that switch is handled effortlessly.No Miyazaki film is complete without a score by Joe Hisaishi and his work here is masterful. It starts off piano heavy and morphs into something a lot more varied as it goes along. A floating castle in the sky is a sight to behold and his score only makes it even more awe inspiring.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the best and most successful early anime films.,"Castle In The Sky produces more wonder and perhaps more excitement than any other film directed by Hayao Miyazaki. It's not his best film, but it's a wonderful early Studio Ghibli effort. Industrial Age Europe was obviously an inspiration on the world of the film. There are elements of the fantastic, like the sky castle itself. The castle was part of a utopia created by an advanced civilization through technology. Miyazaki's animation style presents this world vividly and wonderfully. There is some truly breathtaking scenery. Compared to today's anime, especially by Ghibli, the animation of Castle In The Sky looks crude. This is hardly a distraction though. Until Akira (1988) there were very few big budget anime films. There was also a lack of good talent. What raises Castle In The Sky above average is its design and creativity. It helped that Joe Hisaishi composed an effective score that sounds enchanting in the film. Sheeta, a girl, is the heroine of the story. She meets Pazu, a boy who quickly becomes her best friend. They're good, courageous children. For a Miyazaki film there is a surprisingly large amount of action, producing much excitement. The children are almost always on the move. Sheeta's levistone pendant represents advanced technology, something that saves her again and again. The story isn't very original, but there's still a lot to like here. I highly recommend seeing Castle In The Sky. It's a film that one can treasure.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Another Miyazaki masterpiece!,"In the early 20th century, an orphaned boy named Pazu (Voiced by James Van Derbeek) was working until he finds a girl named Sheeta (Voiced by Anna Paquin) floating from the sky with a crystal around her neck. His own mission is to protect her from government agents like Mushka (Voiced by Mark Hamil) to sneaky air pirates lead by Dola (Voiced by Cloris Leechman) who all want that crystal and to find the secrets that may lead to a legendary floating island in the sky called Laputa.co-starring the voices of Andy Dick, Mandy Patinkin and Richard Dystart, this here is a magnificent work of animated art. This brilliant animated fantasy adventure from writer-producer-director Hayao Miyazaki is one of the most original creations ever as it made big bucks at the Japanese box-office and excellent reviews. In 1989 it came here to the states in a decent dub called ""Laputa: Castle in The Sky"" and then in 1998 they made a redub version that was suppose to come out in 2000 but was delayed until 2003. I adored this movie for years since i was 15 when i had a fansub tape back in 97 when i was 15 and the soundtrack as well, the score to this one is just breathtaking.I also love the beautiful scenery, imaginative creations around the island to the landscapes and of course the action abound with good storytelling. This movie influenced many things like Sonic The Hedgehog 3 to James Cameron's Avatar.The film is pure entertainment and satisfying all the way as it's a must see for any movie or animation fan.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Excellent Film - Runied by re-dub,"This film is amazing and I would recommend to child and adult alike. The animation is beautiful, the characters are rich and interesting, and the story is captivating; far better than anything the American studios were producing at the time. However, there is a couple of caveats to this statement. It's a shame that Disney bought the Studio Ghibli back-catalogue and then proceeded to butcher it. My main point being, Disney re-dubbed the film, despite the original English version being very impressive. The new cast with Van Der Beek et al ruined it and took away much of the attractiveness of the characters e.g. Pazu and Sheeta went from adventurous companions to whiny teenagers. The Original music score is also far better than the Disney remix. It begs the question why did Disney make such changes? It seems to me is that by having Van Der Beek et al being cast then Disney can draw in more money, which is fair enough, but in the process they tainted they film. It is still a beautiful film and I would still recommend it to anyone. My main beef is that Disney ruined a film from childhood which I loved and still love. I am lucky enough to have an original Japanese import with the original English dub which I am now going to guard with my life!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Different Dubs...,"The first time I ever saw this movie was back in the 1980s as a wee lad. My dad actually recorded it off the TV. I must have watched is over 20 times, before the relatively recent release on DVD.I of course bought and watched the DVD and was taken aback by how much the dialogue had changed. In the first version, which I still have on VHS, the mood of the film, thanks to the dialogue, was actually very dark. However the new version, featuring Van Der Beek et al, is more comic.To put it another way, it's like watching the original US release of Akira with that dub, before watching the remastered version with the literal translation of the Japanese.I'm in no way complaining, the story and quality of animation are not detracted from, but it does raise the question of whether Miyazaki intended for a lighter or darker narrative and theme in his film.....",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the best animated films EVER.,"Castle in the sky is undeniably one of the best animated films of all time. The director once again created a story and world of epic proportions just like he did in Nausicaa.Pros: The story is an epic tale nothing short of masterful. The character adaption is very good, each character has a distinct personality that make it even more enjoyable. The director has designed a fantasy world that best suits the movie.Cons: The movie was made in 1986 so the special effects are a bit dated. The characters mouths don't move in the motions of the words the entire time. The story is very hard to understand at the beginning and might confuse some people.",,Anonymous,Animation
I liked this when entertainment value was all that mattered.,"I remember liking this more than Nausicaa of the valley of the winds at an age when that tone of story was too serious for me. Laputa, whose title seems to have affected its release in the U.S. to avoid confusion to its wide Hispanic audiences, has the cartoonish knack of the director's debut production Conan. In fact, Pazu has the thick bones and immortal vitality of Conan--who jumped off a thousand stories carrying his girl in his arms and landed on his feet, then started running. This makes him the most animated and pleasing character to watch. The techie fans of Nausica may be disappointed by the flying bugs and the retro technology through out Laputa--the only exception may be the robot. Unlike Princess Mononoke and Valley of the Winds, the theme in Laputa is not directly connected to environmentalism. If it has a theme at all it's anti-warfare. The importance of living naturally--this is related with the flying castle, is dismissably shortly discussed, and not really followed through. Overall, I now regard the piece as being at an intersection between feel-good and corny.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

The best Japanese anime I've ever seen.,"I rarely watch Japanese animes because they are mostly lack of good stories, awesome animations, etc. Most of Japanese animes I saw were kind of dramas, the animations are very bad and characters are so ugly. Moreover, the stories are not that strong to be my taste. So, I always avoid Japanese animes.I just said that I don't watch Japanese animes, it doesn't mean I don't see one. Some local TV channels in my country air Japanese animes and so, I sometimes see them and didn't like them because the stories are very bad.Laputa: The Castle in the Sky is the first Japanese anime I watched and also it's the only one I loved. When I saw this anime on a website, the reason why I decided was two main characters were kind of cute and lovely. So, I watched it and I loved it.The story is not so simple and not so complicated. But because of the director, it turned out to be a good one. What I love about this anime is how Sheeta and the leader of those pirates became friends.I don't like the castle though. The castle is kind of ruined. Maybe it's because it is ruined in the story. So, the anime creators did like that. But it still works.The anime was produced in 1986 (way before I was born) but the quality is unbelievably good. I haven't a clue before I saw it's production year. When I saw it, I can't believe it because the anime is too good.What I love most is the end credit song. That song is so cool.All in all, for some people, the anime might be kind of inferior to those ones produced in 20th centuries but as for me, it's the best Japanese anime I've ever seen. It's totally worth spending time.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Overdone music for emotion, when the little girl is scared she scream like a women having an or@#$%%$, and it goes on for little annoying details.

This inspired my love and passion for films when I was 4.,"When I was a child and first watched this movie on TV, I was blown away. It didn't go for the action of Star Wars, it didn't go for the comedy of Toy Story, and it didn't go for the romance of Titanic. Instead, it went for pure beauty, and (In my opinion) this accomplished that perfectly.While other people take off marks for the various versions (Both of the English-dubs), I had little problems with them, but I am going to focus on looking at the subtitled-original version with the original music: The way Miyazaki wanted it.The one factor of this movie which was the factor that blew my mind as a child was the music. Such fantastic composition off sounds and emotions brought through the music in each of the scenes. There were moments where the music picked up on the idea of adventure, feelings of loss and loneliness, and then moments of hope and triumph. Truly sublime: In my opinion, perfection and the BEST soundtrack I have heard. I know it is naive to say such a thing, but this is what hit me as a child: the music was such beautiful artwork crafted solely for this movie.The artwork, as Studio Ghibli's artwork always has been, was stunning. These hand-drawn images are so perfectly crafted you can actually see the amount of effort and passion the artists put into this. Together the artwork and the music tickles the imagination of both adults and children.The story is based on the floating island of Laputa: a concept originally presented in the book ""Gulliver's Travels."" It successfully takes that one concept and blooms it into something entirely new. It's beautiful ideas clashing between the original text and Miyazak's own wild and beautiful imagination.The characters are very well written: Miyzaki often focuses on the innocence of the youth, and this film has various themes revolving around that. Pazu and Sheeta want to find the island for selfless reasons: Pazu wants to follow in his late-father's footsteps and find the island, and Sheeta wants to discover her link to it. It is a journey of self discovery for these two characters, while the adults are greedy for money and power. There is a clear sense between who is good and bad which is ambiguous at first, but through the film as we get closer to Pazu and Sheeta, we all discover who to really trust. The characters are believable and there is a constant sense of development in both the characters and the narrative.This is my most favourite film ever because of these reasons. I try to be strict when it comes to films but I find it difficult to criticise this film. There is no such thing as a ""Perfect"" film, but I think this comes pretty close.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

The Quintessential Animated Adventure Film,"Where do I even begin? This is not your average animated film. It has a world that is explored and fleshed out just enough thanks to the runtime.

Her costar, Pazu, comes from a mining town who strives to be like his father, to search for the ancient floating city of Laputa and prove all of the naysayers wrong.

A classic levitating Ghibli,"The thing with Studio Ghibli is that once you decide to sit down and watch one of their movies you are almost guaranteed a thrilling story like nothing else you seen before.

At first, you almost in an instant come to believe that the pirates will be the antagonists of the movie, until the climax of act 1. Then something changes.I can't express how much I love the choice of making the pirates ""switch sides"" and teaming up with our protagonists. The choice of the old ""mother"" starting off as someone you didn't like, to becoming one of the characters that carries the movie is simply brilliant.So much more is of course good, but these are things we se in every Ghibli movie, I don't necessarily feel like I have to even bring them up.While the story and characters is solid, I almost feel like the first 45minutes of the movie is a bit slow. It is almost like the goal of the movie is to far away and unreachable. If we look at spirited away we are at an instant thrown into a mission, then come to explore the world as we go.

Introducing: Studio Ghibli,"The film that officially introduced the world to what would become the greatest animation studio of all time, and it lives up to that honor. All these years later in what now seems to be the twilight era of Studio Ghibli, classic after classic under their belts, Castle in the Sky still manages to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with its best. Hayao Miyazaki's intention with this film was to show off what the studio was capable of, as well as to act as its mission statement - to create animated features of the utmost quality filled with magic, heart, adventure, depth, and purity of artistic intent. It succeeds with flying colors.It's a notable film in Miyazaki's filmography not only for being his first under the Ghibli banner, but also in that it is perhaps his most traditional work during his time with the studio. It employs many classical storytelling techniques that he would later largely abandon as his voice as an auteur deepened: a solid three-act structure, the MacGuffin plot device, as well as a purely villainous antagonist. This was likely a conscious decision with the intent of laying a sturdy, accessible foundation upon which to build the studio's name, and it's by no means a criticism of the film. Quite the contrary, these tried-and-true techniques are employed in absolutely masterful fashion to create what is a clear contender for the studio's strongest and most narratively satisfying action/adventure film. It also lays the groundwork for what would become many of Ghibli's core themes: coming of age, friendship, awe of the natural world, and rich, morally layered characters who are often not all they may seem at first glance.Though it may not have quite the same level of experimentation, uniqueness, and artistic virtuosity as some of Miyazaki's later works, it remains one of his seminal films, as well as one of his most tightly-scripted, well-paced, and purely fun. A classic in its own right.4.5/5",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

A common theme in a lot of dystopian movies is how mankind destroys nature as he takes what he wants and doesn't care for the delicate balance it needs to survive together and this movie depicts it with an undertone of hope.,8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Doesn't the title give away that it does exist...?,"A young girl(Sheeta – that sounds like a crass term for the crapper, but OK; and grown men leer at her... ew), a boy that is her peer, pirates(quirky, as are most of the characters in this... also, it's a mother and a dozen sons of hers... someone needs to start saying no), the government and the military are all seeking the legendary city in the sky Laputa(the whore... man, Miyazaki just had no luck with names in this). This takes off right away(you won't know exactly what's going on from the start... and it doesn't answer every question, or maybe it's how little I know about Eastern culture), and keeps to a quite fast pace, making the two hours fly by. It's got an epic scope, and the adventure is exciting, with several chases. Atmosphere is built effectively, and what happens has an impact. The designs are creative and imaginative, there are unforgettable details, and the animation is fantastic. This is very silly and the humor is over the top. The DVD comes with alternative angle storyboards for the whole thing, 11 minutes of Studio Ghibli trailers, 5 minutes of the opening and ending sans text, 4 minutes of trailers and 2 and a half minutes of artwork. I recommend this to fans of animé. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

An animated steampunk treat the likes of which only Miyazaki could deliver.,"Having only seen a handful of Hayao Miyazaki films, I finally got around to some of his earlier works. Castle in the Sky (1986) might not seem special by today's standards, but in the era when it was released, I'm sure it was quite a bold statement. As a steampunk-styled adventure, there's a lot in this movie that has since been copied and adapted into other works (case in point, my younger brother noticed that it's almost an identical plot to Mega Man Legends which came out a decade later).As Miyazaki's third film, Castle in the Sky sees many of his established visual styles and themes (like flying girls) that he has used in many of his following projects. Even with a relatively simple plot, the gorgeous animated visuals are always a major draw for Miyazaki movies like this. There's a charm that's hard to describe, but it's there in the heart of this film. That it still seems polished by the standards of today's 2D animated films is a testament to the attention to detail that this filmmaker infuses into everything he touches.My only problem with Castle in the Sky is its pacing. There's a significant amount of action early in the film which kept me riveted. However, as the plot continued and explanations became perhaps slightly more convoluted, things slowed down enough that I had trouble staying awake for the ending. It was still an enjoyable watch, but I think I may need to do another rewatch in the future when I'm better equipped (read: well rested). At the very least, this is one of those films I hope to share with my children someday, as it is imaginative and full of lessons that would serve them well.An animated steampunk treat the likes of which only Miyazaki could deliver, I give Castle in the Sky 4.0 stars out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Quick and Short mini-review,"The art direction is this movie is superb, it really brings the Castle in the Sky straight out of Gulliver's Travels and onto the movie screen. The bittersweet robots that inhabit and protect the garden may even end up being some of your favorite anime characters, not because they are amusing, but because of the care and dedication that they exude whenever you see them. Laputa revolves around a boy named Pazu and the girl that floats unceremoniously down from the sky into his life, Sheeta, and how they save Laputa and the world from corruption. An all-around solid anime movie with classic Ghibli humor and spirit, definitely recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pure masterpiece,"This film is a masterpiece, its paced extremely well, with good morals and a delightful cast of characters. This movie while for some is a bit drawn out for a Ghibli movie, in my own opinion is perfect as shortening it would have cut the action too short or the character development would have suffered.

Tenkû no Shiro Rapyuta,I absolutely love movies whether they are live-action or animated along with the adventure genre with it. Adventure movies are some of my favorites.

For its time the movie was probably and extraordinary experience. This films design is incredible, it's so sophisticated for it's time and just creates a magical atmosphere. However for me the simplicity of the movie is something movies lack nowadays, the simple plot alongside the complex designs and music creates a balance which transforms into the unparalleled harmony between the movie and you. This movie just makes you forget about whatever's going on in your life, it makes you feel light and warm. The movie symbolises how power and wealth can control people and corrupt them and blind them to the beauty that is this movie. Overall a must watch for anyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Action filled adventure to the whole family,"Two years after the success of ""Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind"", the makers released their second film, officially Studio Ghibli's first motion picture. ""Laputa- Castle in the Sky"" (Tenku no shiro Rapyuta, 1986) is one of maestro Hayao Miyazaki's most action filled adventure films, where his imaginative visions and never aging animation is once again combined with Joe Hisaishi's beautiful music.This time story is set in an alternative world that has futuristic flying aircrafts but seems otherwise still be in the early 20'Th century. Film's protagonist Pazu is a young boy working in mines, and who dreams of one day finding Laputa, the legendary castle in the sky that his late father claimed to have seen, but whom nobody believed. Pazu's chance to prove his father was right comes unexpectedly when a girl literally falls from the sky to his arms. The girl is Sheeta and she carries with her the key to find Laputa. Since Laputa is claimed to have limitless riches and unforeseen science, Sheeta is chased by air-pirate Dola and her gang, as well as Muska, a power hungry man working for the government. Pazu helps Sheeta and together they try to find Laputa before others.I can imagine how a nowadays Hollywood would probably use a plot like this as an excuse to create a movie with lots of special effects and very little contents. Miyazaki on the other hand over 20 years ago then gave us a film that is both entertaining action film for the whole family and that has interesting and believable characters (interestingly though, this is Miyazaki's only film that has a truly evil villain character, unlike in his later films). As ""Nausicaä"" this film's animation has not suffered much during the last decades and is still far more pleasant to watch, than most of the nowadays western animations. Miyazaki's love for flying and aircrafts shows throughout the whole film and everything is crowned with Joe Hisaishi's wonderful score music.I can't comment the original English dub since I've never heard it, but I can compare the original Japanese audio to Disney's 2003 English audio. The new dub has divided opinions a lot since it has altered the original score and added much more lines to the film. The extra lines may be more helpful to the youngest of the family, but really unnecessary for others. Since Joe Hisaishi himself conducted the altered score for the new dub, there really isn't anything bad to say about this and since dub has even more music, it just might be better. Fans of the original Japanese audio though may be puzzled by the changes in the original score. Voice actors differ. Both Mayumi Tanaka and Keiko Yokozawa are believable as kids, Pazu and Sheeta, but neither James Van Der Beek nor Anna Paquin convinces in the dub, having too mature voices. Kotoe Hatsui and Cloris Leachman are both on the same level as pirate Dola, both making the character witty, funny and sarcastic. On the other hand, Mark Hamill completely surpasses Minori Terada in the role of villainous Muska, Hamill's voice being more menacing and evil (10 years of voicing Joker probably helped). So, Disney's dub has more music and Mark Hamill, but otherwise I recommend original Japanese audio. But to each their own taste.Miyazaki's style is not quite there on the top still in this film, but the story telling takes you completely from the very start that you can't but love this film. It is also suitable for all ages, though has moments that mature audience appreciates more. Another classic from Ghibli.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

One of the best anime movies,"Looking back, this movie has just about everything you could want in a fantasy movie. Pirates, evil orginizations, robust villagers, forbidden technology, robots, underground cave adventures, and of course sky castles!You just can't find originality like this anymore. It has a story that is frozen in time and spans the generations. I have yet to meet anyone that didn't like the film.That said, I have to say, what I was sorely disappointed with was the ENGLISH dub. It was terrible, what were they thinking? Not only did the voice actors just NOT fit their characters (especially the two MAIN characters which were by far the worst match ups) but they messed with the background music --you never do that--in the most cringeworthy way possible. So I wasn't surprised at all to learn that Disney was behind that blunder.I strongly suggest watching the original subbed version of this film, the original voice actors have deliver a perfect performance and deliver that ""missing piece"" that you will undoubtedly find is missing when you view the english dub.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

The Magnum Opus of Miyazaki Soars,"""Castle in the Sky"" (Tenkû no shiro Rapyuta), a timeless masterpiece by Hayao Miyazaki, is the perfect example of the unmatched beauty of Studio Ghibli's animation and storytelling. The film skillfully combines fantasy, adventure, and environmental themes to create a gripping story that will interest viewers of all ages. The animation, which is set against a backdrop of stunning landscapes and fantastical worlds, is a visual feast that highlights the studio's attention to artistic detail and creative talent. The characters, lead by the charming Pazu and Sheeta, set off on a trip that tackles difficult subjects like environmental preservation and the effects of unbridled technological power in addition to exploring themes of friendship, bravery, and pursuing goals.Every frame demonstrates Miyazaki's skill as a director, who skillfully crafts a story that deftly strikes a balance between exhilaration and reflection. The movie asks spectators to consider the nexus between responsibility and progress, and the flying metropolis of Laputa comes to represent both awe and caution. Joe Hisaishi's stirring score for the movie enhances the emotional power of pivotal moments while balancing the images. For those who value the highest level of storytelling and cinematic creativity, ""Castle in the Sky"" is a must-watch since it is a monument to the continuing power of animation to express important themes.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

It has everything you would expect from an anime movie.,"Two Ghibli movies I watched before were disappointing for me. I was sitting in front of the screen with high expectations, confident that I would love it. Not happened. I wasn't willing to try my luck for the 3rd time. But this movie blew my mind.It has everything I want from an anime movie. A vast world that challenges aesthetics and imagination. An intriguing mystery. A soundtrack that I won't get tired of listening to again and again. A well set tempo. A few scenes that will make me emotional, excitement, sadness, joy, it doesn't matter. Likeable characters that I could connect to, even if they weren't very deep.Maybe it would even get full marks if it weren't for a few minor problems that come with being a movie aimed at children too. Too many random events occur for the scenario to progress. The action parts have avoided the ugly side of violence in order to keep up with the fairy-tale narrative of the film. Even if the veil of mystery is not completely lifted, I would like the history of the events to be a little more clear. Even though these are my little notes while watching the movie, I liked it very much.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A wonderful fantasy story,"Another good story from the master of fairy tales Hayao Miyazaki. The main characters are again children who find themselves caught up in an incredible journey - because Sita is not just a girl, but a girl with a crystal. And because Pazu, although a simple miner, has dreamed of an adventure in the sky all his life. His dream is destined to come true.In terms of anesthetics, fans of both steampunk and technical delights will appreciate it. But at the same time, as always, there is still room for magic and wonder. The whole plot revolves around fantasy elements - after all, this is a fairy tale!What is also striking is the rather meticulous work done on the detailing of each scene. Every detail of every mechanism, vehicle, every interior and every costume is thought out. This pedantry is pleasantly pleasing to the eye, bringing the cartoon closer to the real world, in which everything is created for a reason.

Not to disrespect the American voice-over but the original Japanese brings a different vibe throughout the movie. The American Castle In The Sky seems like a different movie. Not to mention the music is placed a little differently(Yes I can tell. That's how many times I watched this) I believe I am one of a few that actually read the book that came out with the movie when it first came out. It was fantastic to say the least. It gives us the inner thoughts of the characters and the meanings of some of the little things you see in the background. Also an extra ending after what appears in the movie ends.The music is unlike anything else, too. I hear people use its theme song as ringtones still.Until this day, when people ask me what is my favorite movie since I am an indi filmmaker. I tell them ""Laputa"".",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Classic fantasy adventure, plain and simple","Castle in the Sky is the first film by Studio Ghibli, released originally in 1986. It is every bit as good as one would expect from a Ghibli film: beautiful animation and art, colourful and memorable characters, great score and a good story.The story concerns a boy named Pazu who on one day sees a girl called Sheeta falling from the sky. Together they set out to find the legendary flying castle of Laputa. The story is well paced and truly an adventure: by the end the small village Pazu used to live in feels like the distant past.The first thing I should say is this is A GREAT FILM. It's well written, beautifully animated and overall masterfully executed. Yet Studio Ghibli has produced so many fantastic films that this one stands out as a more simplistic story. There's not the ecological message of Nausicaä, the overwhelming adorability of Totoro or the grim moral ambiguity of Mononoke. After watching it twice I still haven't detected much of an overarching theme or message overall. Also the female lead, Sheeta, is somewhat disappointing as more of a typical damsel in distress. This is a bit jarring considering Ghibli's history of producing strong female characters one after another (Chihiro, San, Nausicaä, Satsuki, the list goes on).The animation is good and the visual design is very impressive. Still, some of the technical aspects are hopelessly dated: the animation can be choppy at times, and the characters are fairly devoid of detail. Though considering just how much happens in the film, the simplistic designs are somewhat forgivable, especially when we see entire armies on-screen at times.But mostly this is just nitpicking. Castle in the Sky is a wonderful, imaginative piece of fantasy adventure, and shows more creativity, personality and imagination in 5 minutes than most mainstream films show in 500 minutes.Recommendation: A must-see for any fan of fantasy cinema or Studio Ghibli. For everyone else, highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wings of Wonder,"Watching Castle in the Sky felt like being swept into a realm where childhood wonder meets the boundless possibilities of dreams. Hayao Miyazaki's masterpiece effortlessly blends fantastical adventure with poignant reflections on power and nature, inviting me to reconsider the delicate balance between technological ambition and the beauty of the natural world. As I followed Pazu and Sheeta on their breathtaking quest to uncover the secrets of Laputa, I was struck by the film's ability to evoke both exhilaration and introspection. The floating island, shrouded in mystery and ancient lore, became a metaphor for forgotten histories and the timeless human longing to rediscover lost marvels. Each meticulously animated scene, from soaring aerial escapades to quiet, reflective moments, resonated with me on a deeply personal level, reminding me of the magic that lingers just beyond our everyday horizons. It's a heartfelt exploration of hope, resilience, and the enduring allure of dreams that continue to inspire us long after the journey ends.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"The most enchanting, beautiful and magical film you'll ever watch!","Released in 1986 under the direction of the now legendary Hayao Miyazaki and known for being the first full length feature of again the now legendary Studio Ghibli. Too many the film is seen as nostalgic, enchanting and rank highly in the greatest animation films list. However, with this I disagree this isn't just the one of the greatest animation or greatest animation film ever made...It is the greatest FILM ever made. Castle In The Sky completely blew me away to the point of being stunned and left in complete silence by the final scene. Words simply cannot describe how beautiful this masterpiece of a film really is. The soundtrack is possibly the best featured in any film ever, with beautiful orchestral and piano centred compositions capturing the aw and beauty magnificently of the on-screen visuals. The film flows perfectly with each scene progressing the plot and developing the story. Our two protagonists are simply amazing, with the duo having some of the best chemistry ever put to screen and of course while the whole film is simply stunning, the final act is one of the most enchanting, beautiful and magical experiences in film history. I can safely say that this may be one of the only films without a single minor flaw, even nit- picking is near-impossible. The plot follows the story of a young girl who is saved by a mysterious power concealed in her necklace after falling from an airship. She is cared for by a young miner boy who instantly bonds with her and reveals to her his burning passion to find the ancient sky city of Laputa. All while a rowdy group of pirates and a relentless agent ruthlessly hunt the two with the intention of finding and raiding the city. Castle In The Sky also completely surprised me with it's huge, spectacular action scenes and fat-paced adventure theme especially towards the end of the first act. Miyazaki and the Ghibli team completely blew my mind in what they achieved with this anime classic.

Fun adventure,"Castle in the sky is the first studio Ghibli,second film directed by Hayao Miyazaki. The first official film released by the studio. Inspired by the short story of the same name from Gulliver travels. The film follows the story of two kids Sheeta & Pazu in search of the lost floating city of the laputa. Along the way these kids are pinned against multiple assailants from pirates to government official. Sheeta you get off right off the back that she is very important. She has a crystal around her neck that throughout the movie are you thinking you just need that, the entire film everybody from pirates to military wants her. Puzo takes on the role more traditional hero,he has his own reasons why he wants to find the city but his motivation throughout the movie is to protect sheeta. The Villan himself is nothing really that special though he does have a purpose for wanting laputa that you may figure out for yourself before it revealed. There are quite a fair amount of action filled moments with scenes from air plane flights to train track chases it's a fun race against the clock. It keeps you invested and you want to see the conclusion to the journey. The biggest mystery of course being the importance of the city or who are the people that lived here and what the city actually was one of the highlights most remember from this film is the giant robot very having a very simple design but yet having a very rustic look to it, But all of a sudden it starts shooting off lasers and you're wondering just how advanced the ""ancient"" city probably was. Castle in the sky still remains a classic and stunning work because of that it helped launch anime into the main demographic.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Plenty of Fun and Adventure for the Inner Child,"Castle in the Sky is a film directed by Hayao Miyazaki. What a fun thrill ride this was. Floating castles. Sky pirates. Gorgeous visuals. Jaw-dropping action. Fun humor. Add all these together and it makes one of my favorite animated films ever.Where should even I start with this masterpiece? Well, first the story. It's just a basic coming-of-age, adventure story. Two kids, Pazu and Sheeta, find a mysterious object, so together they try to discover the secret behind this object as well as learn more about each other. Throw in some bad guys here and there, and you got yourself an adventure film fun for the whole family.But of course, that isn't enough from the great Miyazaki. I'm sure any other filmmaker would have done a fine job with this premise. Miyazaki, however, gives his audience an engaging story with such a grand and epic fantasy experience. He puts so much effort into this film, I felt as if I was coming along for the ride. I would have loved to have seen this film on the big screen. Watching the cinematic opening scene and hearing the beautiful theme song. When I first watched it, I felt I was gonna like it. I didn't expect to love it so much!I saw the English dubbed version, which I always prefer for anime. Though, I think the dub could have been a little better. The main problem were the two main characters. It's fine as it is, but I think Pazu sounded older than he looked. Also Sheeta has what I believe was a British accent throughout the film, but her accent would sometimes sound like it was fading in and out. With all that said, if anyone reading this prefer subtitles with the original audio, that's fine too. It's understandable.Another thing I should point out is not really a complaint, just an observation. The pacing does slow down towards the end. It's not a problem, but it also wouldn't be a problem if about 5 minutes were shaved off. But, it still helps set the mood and atmosphere. Those who haven't seen the movie should keep in mind that it isn't all fast-paced action.Overall, I really love this movie. A film like this can only be topped by Miyazaki's own ""My Neighbor Totoro"" (but that's for another review). I highly recommend it for the whole family. And if you get the chance, check out the incredible soundtrack. I can honestly say this is one of my favorite films ever.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

I probably never will be able to make a decision about that.So forget about that and let me just say, watching a movie that carries the name ""Miyazaki"" somewhere is a guarantee for being on a trip through fantastic lands, inhabited by fresh, cool, amusing, impressive creatures and enjoying some of the most charming and unpredictable tales ever told.Some words on the graphics: This movie was made in a time where a computer that was capable of displaying the game ""Pong"" in a decent way had the size of a one-story-house. There was no Pixar, no ILM, no WETA Digital. There were crayons, pens and the talented hands of the incredible crew, gathered around Hayao Miyazaki. And just with that they created animated pictures that even nowadays let most other cartoons look like the work of an infant. An example? Just take a look at the castle towards the end.This is not a movie. This is a world on its own.

Beautiful stuff, and really fun and exciting!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
BEST FILM FANTEZY,"I watched this film not long ago, when I was lying sick and looking for what film to watch) Its original title was LAPUTA Castle in the Sky, of course I don't really like the fantasy genre, but this film made me fall in love) The film itself is very well written, I didn't immediately I understood, but then everything was clear, the roles of the actors are simply wonderful, the music and voice acting are also good, I liked everything, I won't spoil it, be sure to watch it!!! Now I've switched to films by this creator and there are still a lot of interesting things, after watching, I'll definitely write reviews on his other films!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Even in Their Early Works, Studio Ghibli Fires on All Cylinders","Airships, floating islands, sky pirates and lost civilizations in this dreamy, upbeat animated adventure. It's the first-ever film produced by Studio Ghibli and only Hayao Miyazaki's second feature-length (after 1984's Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind), but already both parties are testing their boundaries and nonchalantly blowing past expectations. Really incredible that Laputa still stands up so well, given its age and scope, and I mean that in both an artistic and a thematic sense.There's a rich sense of humanity to the plot and a sweet innocence shared by the determined young protagonists (both Miyazaki hallmarks), with an irresistible fiber of discovery running through the whole production. And, naturally, each of the fantastical flying machines and techno-organic wonders are fleshed out to an absurd level, with operational mechanics playing a crucial role in several memorable scenes. That's another Miyazaki calling card, for those keeping track at home.Meanwhile, the animation team swiftly meets and defies convention in a series of brilliant, preposterous early action scenes. Most remarkable among these is a crazy automotive chase through a sleepy mining village and across an active railroad bridge, an intensely kinetic effort that's bursting with creative power and realized potential. Ghibli can do the pulse-pounding stuff extremely well, right out of the gates, but the team also knows how to let a delicate moment linger, to give a scene room to breathe for greater dramatic effect. Those latter points are important during the climax, as we explore a crumbling airborne palace and learn about the forgotten culture it once housed. All this, of course, while dodging the military and foiling the efforts of a particularly formidable evil mastermind (voiced, in the English dub, by Mark Hammill).Despite the years, Laputa is timeless; a magical, warm-hearted fantasy ride that deserves equal footing with many of the studio's later, more heralded works. It might even be more impressive than Mononoke or Spirited Away, considering the team's relative inexperience at the time.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Beautiful and Timeless Miyazaki Film,"Personal Rating: 9/10I last watched this movie when I was nine years old. Nine years later, I revisited it and fell in love with the same enchanting storytelling I did so many years ago.Hayao Miyazaki is a master at his craft, creating a universe that lives on the edge of realism and idealism that captivates you. The visuals are stunning, it's impossible to compare them to the likes of Disney and Pixar because it's just so different, it's as if every frame could be a piece in an art museum. Coupled with an enchanting story, likable characters (even though some were quite shallow), fantastic pacing, and an incredible score by Joe Hisaishi. This is a movie you should go ahead and buy because you can watch it over and over again without it ever getting old.Okay, I have to go on about the score, it's beautiful. It was the music that brought back so many memories for me of when I watched this movie as a child. It was the music that had stuck with me all these years. Joe Hisaishi creates feelings not just sounds.The Girl Who Fell From The Sky - Joe Hisaishi",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Aerial adventures,"This film is probably the most escapist of Miyazaki's works. It is full of fantasies and imagination, especially all the aerial adventures. It is quite a thrill to watch this movie and all its cool moments, intense action and visual grandeur.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Better than Spirited Away,"In no way am I slamming Spirited Away! It is a great film! But there is something about the purity of Castle in the Sky that blows me away. Has there ever been a more beautiful title sequence than the one in this film or a more beautiful musical theme or a more breathtaking castle? Each scene seems patiently thought through and carefully timed. The character development is plentiful but not overdone. I really love this film. More than anything else, I think it is dear to my heart.For one thing, I can't get over the action sequences. The mother is hilarious and totally runs the show with her band of hyper-masculinized idiots. It is a real joy to see the cars swerve back and forth as characters speed down the road in a tense car chase. There is real humor and grit in this film, and I believe that it belongs on anyone's list of classics, along with the rest of Ghibli's repertoire.My introduction to this film was upon reading Leonard Maltin's movie guide book about 7 years ago. I was very surprised to see that he had given a Japanese anime film 4 stars. (If anyone is familiar with Maltin, you would know he doesn't just ""give away"" four stars). He said that it was one of the best action films ever made, animated or otherwise. I was already familiar with Miyazaki's work via Spirited Away and was very excited to get my hands on a copy of Castle in the Sky. At first, I wasn't all that impressed with the film. It seemed melancholy compared to the flat-out dynamism of Spirited Away. But over time this film has warmed up to me and has earned a special place on my shelf. I would recommend to anyone interested in seeing this film, or who has seen it before and didn't really like it, to give it time. Allow Castle in the Sky to enchant you. It is SO worth it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Originally seen without a dub, but I understood everything","This film was pushed on me by a anime hound as his favorite movie. I watched it, undubbed and no subtitles, and it became one of my own favorite films. I didn't understand a single word of the dialog, but this imagery was so crystal clear that I understood everything.It worked so well that when I was in Japan, I bought several over Ghibli videos, but none of them was transcendental like this one.About the tenth time I saw the film, it was the dubbed version. I don't hearing the actual dialog for the first helped. Via the images, I already knew it, somehow. And what fantastic imagery -- some of the best imagery I've seen in any film. There is indeed a Castle in the Sky, from which one may rule.Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A film to watch when you're young, and watch again when you've grown up","Like many reviewers here, I also recommend to watch it in the original Japanese. Characters are more vivid, and the music is more atmospheric. Unfortunately, Disney was too true to its policy not to allow a moment without music when nobody is talking. Miyazaki's (or a characteristic to any Japanese artwork) mastery of sound and silence, existence and voidness, were thereby systematically destroyed. It's also noticeable that music was grossly modified. Some may like this way, but I believe the original held the beauty of this film more effectively. Simply, my ears remember it as I heard in the original even though it was more than 10 years ago!The dubbing was done alright. Mark Hamill ('Muska') and Cloris Leachman ('Dola') were excellent. But James van der Beek ('Pazu') was a wrong choice. Pazu is good-natured, but essentially a tough orphan boy who works in a mine. Van der Beek cannot act on such a role, and instead he made Pazu sound like a middle-class boy who would perform well at school. Pazu in the original was a boy who wouldn't look back a second, but Pazu van der Beek was a rich boy who tried to be wild and that was pathetic.Is there a lesson in this film, besides entertainment? Many say it's about power and greed. Sure, those are important sidelines. But I think the most important message was the critique on our industrial civilisation. Towards the end of the film, Sheeta says ""I see now why the Laputians left the castle. You cannot live away from the earth and soil!"" I reckon this is the one-line message from Miyazaki. During the opening credit, we see the concise history of the Laputa world: a steam engine -> industrial revolution -> advances to the sky -> flying cities -> arms race -> war -> people leaving from the fallen ships -> back to the simple life on earth. Miyazaki's world view is clear - he's an environmentalist. He also has a social side. In planning this film, Miyazaki travelled to Wales. It was 1980s, when many mining towns were suffering from closure. Miyazaki felt so much compassion to those townspeople, and made those people immortal in this film. Though idealised, we meet them in Pazu's mining valley.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Don't bother with Avatar when this is avaiable,"I have seen plenty of animated movies since the late 80s, but very few stand up to this film's originality and adventurousness. And why stop at animated movies? I mean, ""Avatar"" is fine and everything, but I'll take this. Miyazaki has a unique gift for storytelling (and characters). Watching movies like this with my kids has been a gift.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Yet another Miyazaki masterpiece (surprise).,"It almost sounds demeaning to call this one of the most enjoyable animated films I've ever seen; it is, in fact, one of the most enjoyable films of any kind I've ever seen.  Anyone familiar with the work of Miyazaki will find a lot of familiar territory here: the rural setting, the preoccupation with aircraft, the mythic themes. What separates this (along with the hilarious ""Porco Rosso"") is its playful brand of movie-serial cliffhanger action. There's much more to smile at here than in its more serious cousins such as Mononoke and Nausicaa. It's one of the handful of films that one can point to when trying to demonstrate the heights of which animation is capable.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Masterpiece of Animation and Storytelling,"""Castle in the Sky"" is not just a film; it's an experience that encapsulates the very essence of what makes Studio Ghibli a timeless treasure in the world of animation. The beautiful animation, with its breathtaking landscapes and intricately designed characters, serves as the perfect canvas for a story that resonates deeply with the human spirit.The tale is a profound exploration of innocence corrupted by the greed of men, and how the purity of children and the beauty of nature can be tainted by this insatiable desire for power. Watching Pazu and Sheeta's journey, I felt an overwhelming sense of wonder and a desire to be a better person. Their bravery, kindness, and unwavering hope in the face of adversity remind us of the purity and strength that lies within each of us.The story is more than just an adventure; it's a poignant commentary on the impact of human greed on the world around us. The contrast between the lush, vibrant world of Laputa and the desolate, mechanical reality below highlights the consequences of our actions on the environment and our communities.Adding to the film's magic is the soul-capturing score by Joe Hisaishi. His music perfectly complements the narrative, enhancing every emotional beat and drawing viewers even deeper into the world of Laputa. The hauntingly beautiful melodies linger long after the movie ends, encapsulating the film's themes of wonder, innocence, and the bittersweet passage of time.""Castle in the Sky"" is a film that stays with you long after the credits roll. It inspires reflection and a renewed sense of responsibility towards the world we live in. It's a reminder that, despite the darkness in the world, there is always hope and the potential for redemption.This film is a masterpiece, deserving of a perfect score. It beautifully blends stunning animation with a story that is both heartwarming and thought-provoking. ""Castle in the Sky"" is a testament to the power of storytelling and its ability to inspire us to be better, kinder, and more mindful of the world and people around us.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Best Animated Film Ever Made,"I was pretty disappointed after watching Princess Mononoke. The beginning starts out very exciting. More excitement follows, when the air pirates try to abduct her and the guy. The necklace she wears does some very strange things, and it becomes a mystery. They want to find Laputa, the castle in the sky. The guy believes in it after seeing his father's pictures when he saw it. So this huge adventure takes place when they also try to evade the government and find Laputa and to protect the necklace. This movie has lots of spoilers, so I'm not going to say anything, but that this movie is FANTASTIC! Don't be afraid to see it, it's the best thing to come out of Japan, ever.",,Anonymous,Animation

"for once, i won't ramble - it's ace","Just this one time I'm going to leave the endless waffle to everyone else here. This is a film that, when little (like, 7 or 8) I accidentally caught on the TV one bored afternoon, and didn't switch off til the end (being too young to fully appreciate the true horror of a Macek dub). And, after that, didn't get chance to see it again until spotting mention on a website... an internet search, a long download later, and......joy... horrendous, low rate file of a third-generation tape, but still joy.I would like to do a test whereby you show a random selection of people the first three minutes, before the credits, and see how many of them go ""and...? show me the rest!"". it's a great hook... and that music will be getting sneaked onto the next classical compilation tape i make for my nan :) :)Made slight mention of finding it to a friend over email, and she went -absolutely mental-. Five pages of ""laputa! laputa! wheee!"". Turns out her dad messed up the settings on the VCR and recorded this instead of a Grand Prix... and, after viewing, broke out the record-protect tab.

A beautiful and magical adventure movie,"Many people who have never seen anime consider it all one genre. This movie proves this wrong more effectively  than any other one I've seen. Laputa: castle In The Sky is magical, funny, sweet and wonderfully animated. A young boy, Pazu, catches a girl falling from the sky, a glowing stone on a necklace she wears. From there, the two are chased by the army and pirates, all trying to find the beautiful and powerful floating castle of Laputa. Not only is Laputa a wonderful adventure story, it can make you stop and think about the horrible effects of war and absolute power. I very nearly cried at the end. Try and see the original subtitled version, though I haven't seen the new dub, with the original music and voices.",,Anonymous,Animation
Why not just tune into Nickelodeon?,"I had ordered this film with much anticipation off the Internet, since I had already seen most of Miyazaki's works, and I was surprised that it didn't grab me at all. The animation is very simple, it looks exactly like any Saturday morning cartoon (although admittedly, some of the backgrounds are of a higher caliber). The only things to differentiate it from a programme on Nickelodeon are the magical and beautiful score by Hisaishi, and the storyline. I would've loved to love this movie as much as I did Miyazaki's other efforts, but it just didn't have any resonance, it was too cartoony and childish. Maybe I'll watch it again and gain a different impression, maybe I've been spoiled by Spirited and Mononoke, but I just know this isn't anywhere near as impressive as those.4/10",,Anonymous,Animation

I had very high expectations, cuz hey, it's studio ghibli, and i thought the first half was sorta boring but it started getting really good and exciting once they got to Laputa (you should see the design of Laputa). It was only after i started watching it again that i noticed that could not appreciate the beginning it was meant for. I would only wait for good action and reard the rest as ""boring."" The characters are well developed, and it is overall well paced, though the scene where pazu and sheeta are floating down after falling off the rails might look familiar.
