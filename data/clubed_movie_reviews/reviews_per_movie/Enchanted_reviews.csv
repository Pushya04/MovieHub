That good old story with a modern twist,"Combining elements of modern day Manhattan with romanticized fairy tale settings, ""Enchanted"" tells the story of Giselle (Adams), your typical Disney leading lady living in a cottage, singing with innocent creatures, awaiting the day she would meet her prince charming. He turns out to be Prince Edward (James Marsden), a dashing debonair who happens to be the stepson of the wicked witch Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon). They meet, fall in love in a whim, and decide to marry the next day.Problem is, step-mom wouldn't allow anyone to take over her throne so she poses as an old woman and pushes a clueless Giselle into a well that transports to - ahem - our world, where her quixotic perspective sets her apart from everyone else. Her city misadventures eventually lead her to Robert (Patrick Dempsey), a divorce lawyer separated from his wife and trying to raise his daughter Morgan (Rachel Covey) by himself.While awaiting to be rescued by her Prince Edward, Giselle bonds with father and daughter, with him teaching her a thing or two about dating, and her teaching him on the positive aspects of love.While obviously an attempt to satirize the genre it carved its name on, this Disney flick helmed by Kevin Lima does it in a way that's not in a mocking manner as Dreamworks animated films usually are. Rather, they are handled with affection that makes the fairy tale angle a rather sweet and funny affair. The interweaving elements of live-action and animation blend alright and don't feel unbalanced.Of course, you can say that this movie really belongs to Adams, who with her cheerful nature, makes it easy for one to feel for her character by providing depth and giving an additional dimension to Giselle. The supporting cast pale in comparison although they do have their moments, especially Sarandon who easily hams it up during a climactic event.""Enchanted"" doesn't necessarily mark a return of the old fairy tale magic conspicuously absent in recent Disney films; but it has the charms and clever wit - not to mention star Amy Adams bubbly charisma - to win over audiences outside the target demographic.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"The steel beast is defeated peasants, you are freeEnchanted","In honor of the Thanksgiving holiday, I will post a family film review. Who better to deliver in that genre than Disney with their new animated/live action hybrid Enchanted. This movie is very cute and quite good at being both wholesome for the kiddies and tongue-in-cheek for the adults. You need to appreciate a studio being able to poke fun at itself. By using the classic stories of Cinderella, Snow White, and Sleeping Beauty, all made famous in their own right by the Mouse House, we are given some big laughs. The acting is very self-referential and broad as far as the fairy tale roles that make the journey into our world's New York City go. Screenwriter Bill Kelly gives the cast some great lines and set pieces to play in, ultimately showing us that the storybooks aren't always right. True love does exist, but not necessarily with the one you first think. The message is good, the songs are good, the animation and acting are goodDisney came through with this one. Along with Meet the Robinsons, Mickey and friends may be turning the ship around into a new renaissance.We are ushered into the story with some 2D animation of Giselle, a pretty girl looking for her Prince Charming. That man is in fact Prince Edward, recently being led by his stepmother's henchman to battle ogres and partake in adventure to keep his mind off a wife. You see if he marries, Queen Narissa loses her crown and he becomes King. She is having none of that and will cross into evil stepmother/queen/hag territory to trick Giselle into falling through a portal to our world. Now a fish-out-of-water, she must find her way back to her love, that eventually comes looking for her along with her best friend Pip the squirrel and the evil witch's lackey Nathaniel. It is on this path that she runs into divorce lawyer Robert Philip and turns both his and her life upside down.I love how the fantasy world comes into ours so awkwardly. Giselle's ability to call on all the animals of her meadows allows her to do the same in NY, only the creatures she gets are rats, pigeons, cockroaches, and fliesyet they all do the work anywayit's priceless. Also, when she breaks into song, all the people on the streets join along and have a blast being part of the huge choreographed numbers. Her innocence is very precious and trying new things always gets her new lawyer friend in trouble, yet helps those in her wake. Patrick Dempsey plays that friend to great effect. He sees what she is doing and can't help but fall for her joyful, inability to see cruelty in the world. Playing the straight man to her craziness leads to wonderful moments of laughter as well as those full of poignancy and compassion, giving the kids in the audience something to think about and lessons to learn.While Dempsey's evolution as a man is something to appreciate, it is the transplants that shine. Amy Adams and James Marsden play Giselle and Prince Edward respectively. They bring the happy-go-lucky mentality of Andalasia to our disenchanted realm. The over-acting is great and the culture shock fantastic. Adams is gorgeous and has the chops to make the aloofness work, but also change later on into a human being that sees what reality brings. When she tells Edward that she was thinking instead of singing, his reaction really hits home on the vast void between storybook fantasy and the real world. As for Marsden, his childish actions are truly funny; a borderline simpleton, he believes in chivalry and when he is told a suspected villain is really a friend, he just flips a switch and is OK with it. His smile is infectious and his vacant expressions indispensable to the film working on the dual levels it does.Everything works here to bring a wonderful family-friendly story to life. Complete with its pop-up book bookends, Enchanted is truly magical. I don't know how it could ever have worked as a complete animated work, as I have read it originated as, so thankfully they took the plunge to expand it with live action. Crossing between the two worlds is seamless2D characters turned into humans or 3D computer generated animals. With many instances ripe for a wrong turn, the filmmakers seem to come to all the right decisions. Working in older Disney yarns and playing each story thread to its effective conclusion leaves us with a tale that could become a classic amongst the ones it appropriates. So, if you are looking for a way to spend a couple hours with the whole family, Enchanted is definitely a great way to go.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
An enjoyable romp.,"This is really the definition of ""light entertainment,"" and seriously, I am still smiling about it now. After getting in the way of an Evil Queen, a fairytale princess is cast into an alternate reality--the real world as we know it--and must survive there until her rescue by her Prince Charming. Hmm! From the trailer I saw, my guess was that ""Enchanted"" was a one-joke show, a series of gags about how fairytale magic falls on its face in the real world. That Disney has managed to squeeze at least four or five good jokes out of the idea, and mixed in a few sprinkles of profundity on top of that, is something of an achievement. As a romp, it works fairly well, and it delivered quite a lot more than I was expecting.This is a risky film to make, and Disney gets points for having the guts to unleash this oddity on the holiday season. It's a fun film that isn't afraid to go, occasionally, in weird and startling directions.The intersection of the two worlds--the world of faith and magic, and the world of disillusionment and hard reality--creates the expected comedic drama at first. Then the two opposing realities begin to influence and change each other in unsettling and stimulating ways that may surprise the audience. The ideas aren't fully developed, but a crucial detail was attended to at the wrap-up that satisfied me--the main characters succeed mainly because they are able to grow beyond their previous conceptions of themselves.Along the way of telling this story, we get to see a very challenging film production featuring two distinct worlds and their accompanying designs, and the intermingling of these two worlds. It's occasionally heavy on visual effects and animated sequences, but the effects are always story-driven and never gratuitous--a surprising enough thing nowadays that it's worth taking note of. Strong film-making skills, with an old-school sensibility, are at work.My rating gets an extra point for an audacious, overblown MGM-style singing/dancing sequence, the kind that is rarely seen in theatres nowadays. Go see it!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Bearably Cute,"My friends and I are big Disney fanatics, so we went to see Enchanted with open minds.The movie's playful satire of the age of classic Disney animation is the best part. Even the title is written in the Gothic style shown in Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty. The animation and score (composed by Alan Menken...see The Lion King and numerous other 90s Disney movies) are simply the icing on the cake at the beginning. In the animation world the kids will be entertained and the teenagers and adults will chortle as they remember the overly-enthusiastic naiveness of the protagonists of early Disney films.Giselle (played superbly by Amy Adams...this woman walks, sits down, does EVERYTHING in character. The innocent vitality she has for life at the beginning of the movie never wavers even when she experiences reality) is super excited to get married to her cliché Prince Charming (James Marsden, also wonderful. His range is incredible...I still can't believe he is also Cyclops and Corny Collins). Conveniently, Charming rides up on his white horse and saves her from a troll, and upon meeting her for the first time decides to get married the next day. But alas, the evil queen(Susan Saradon, who has a regrettably short part so I can't comment on her performance) knows that once Charming, her stepson, marries Giselle she will have to give up her throne to her stepdaughter. So she decides to trick her into a play ""where there are no happily ever afters"" by way of a magic well.Patrick Dempsey plays a lawyer who grows skeptical of the subtle fantasy of living thanks to his own corroding marriage, but thankfully he meets Giselle who reminds him (through turning a daily stroll through Central Park into a musical Howard Ashman would be proud of) of the Disney magic in everyone! The movie is rather cute, but the singing and the happiness and the flowers get annoying (although still bearable) after about an hour. The score is better than the forgettable script...the jokes come from the performances, not the writing. I was mostly disappointed in the holes in the plot. Events that shouldn't have happened in reality were never explained (how did the queen's henchman keep disguising himself? How was Giselle able to swing herself up on a building after the queen?)...I know the movie's supposed to be a fantasy but the screenwriters should not completely alter the rules of reality when the point is to show the differences between the real and animated world.The script is the biggest flaw. Frankly I think the cinematography could have been better too, especially in Giselle's scenes (more sweeping tracking shots of the scenery would have maintained the realism of the fantasy). But whatever. It wasn't a waste of a movie. Take the kids, and Disney fanatics will appreciate the attempt to recreate the classic animation age...but will notice some elements missing that makes this movie feel like it has less heart than it advertises.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
This isn't just a movie...it is a time-machine to the glory days of Disney.,"I'm a teenage boy, and the reviews for ""Enchanted,"" along with some friendly persuasion from my sisters, moved me to give this live action/animated combo. a chance. In the first fourteen minutes of Enchanted, there were two things that caught my attention: 1)The never-ending, sugar-coated, sing-along tune and 2) The grainy style of animation that Disney lavished upon the screen(a tribute to the Disney classics, such as Beauty and the Beast and Sleeping Beauty); in this time span, I felt truly embarrassed to be sitting in the theater with the older couples clustered around me. I mean, what kind of boy in his right mind would want to watch a movie with musical numbers and pretty princesses? And yet, there was something about it...the aire of it almost took me back to the days of my childhood when I would smash my face up to the T.V. screen, when Belle and the Beast were having their unforgettable ball dance or when Ariel was brushing her hair with a fork. It was these sorts of memories that surfaced to my mind as I kept watching Enchanted. And it kept getting better and better. When there was a sudden switch to live-action, my heart was captured by Amy Adams, who seems to be, in my opinion, the finest choice for Giselle. Prince Edward and Robert also had their perfect fits (James Marsden and Patrick Dempsey). Even though this movie is close to perfect, it still has its problems. There is an aire of predictability in the storyline, as well as the fact that it's swamped with clichés (some of which are fresh, and some of which are flat). Yet it flows on, innocently, with its strong actors/actresses, decent-enough screenplay that gives you a warm feeling in your heart (which is what Disney is supposed to do, right?), spectacular music numbers that have charm, and the fact that it is suitable for all ages. There is a little something for everyone in this film--and it's not just a film either--it is a time-machine back to the golden era of Disney's animated films, and its live-action ones as well. And it helps me look forward to the new Disney: one that keeps surprising me more and more every single day.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Can a guy like this movie?  Actually, yeah","'Enchanted' looks like a movie that a guy would never be seen at. C'mon, it's another Disney princess, and just looks pretty girly, right? Well, this is true. But it is funny enough to make both males and females enjoy a film where Disney pokes fun at their own masterpieces in the form of a Cinderella, Snow White, or Sleeping Beauty.Princess Giselle leaves the cartoon world for the real world, and has a whale of a time adjusting to the harsh realities of a life other than ""happy ever after."" This is where the movie is at its best, as Amy Adams is very funny and cute playing a princess who must adjust to life in New York City while bringing her very own charm to the real world, and teaches lessons about true love while also learning important aspects of relationships from the man who is lucky- or unlucky?- enough to have found her.The ending is kind of weird, but that's not to spoil a movie that is for the most part refreshing in its premise and delivers plenty of genuine laughs. 3/4 stars",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Adorable Family Film,"I had recently seen a screening of this movie and was pleasantly surprised that it had completely exceeded my expectations. The theater was full of laughs from the beginning throughout all ages. In the beginning I was worried that Amy Adams would make Giselle seem like some obnoxious daytime children's television character, but instead she managed to please the audience during the entire movie. There was also enough humor to keep the older viewers entertained from hilarious allusions to popular fairy tales and even some ""adult"" themes insinuated, while still keeping the film Disney clean. Overall I completely enjoyed this movie and recommend it to all families.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
I loved Enchanted!,"I first saw the trailer for Enchanted in the spring, from the moment it ended, I knew this was a movie that I wanted to see. I finally saw it today and it's everything that I hoped for and more. It was nice to finally see a Disney movie that wasn't computer animated, the beginning was almost a forgotten memory of the old fashion animation that I miss so much. But Enchanted is without a doubt one of the most fun films of the year and so perfect for the whole family. I though the plot was so extremely clever, what if the cartoons with the fairytale stories met into today's world? Especially in New York City? The cast just looked like they had the ultimate blast making this movie and really brought it to life. They each held their own and were a perfect choice for the comedic role they had to play. Enchanted is a clever twist on the classic fairy tale.Giselle has just met the prince of her dreams, he's saved her from a troll and asked for her hand in marriage, everything seems to be going good for them. But Prince Edward's step mother has other plans in mind when she doesn't want to give up her crown and let Giselle take it. So she sends Giselle to another world, one where there is no ""happily ever after"", cut to New York City 2007. She's in human form and needs to get back to her land, she meets a man Robert and his daughter, Morgan, she stays with them and ends up falling for Robert. Just in time since Prince Edward throws himself to the other dimension to save her, but it's definitely a life changing experience for both of them, especially when the queen arrives to take care of Giselle herself.Enchanted is one of the year's best movies and one of Disney's best, I guarantee it'll be a true classic down the line. The whole story was charming as well as funny and just a great time to watch, I don't know if I could pick a favorite part, there were so many to choose from, but I think the part where the prince first arrives to New York, how determined he is, he even takes on the city bus because he thinks it's a beast. For me, I think James Mardson stole the film as Prince Edward, he just played it off so perfectly and was such a pleasure to watch on the screen. Enchanted is one of the year's best films, I would highly recommend it for you or the family, it's a definite treasure of 2007.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
enchanting,"In the animated land of Andalasia, the evil Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon) wants to keep his stepson Prince Edward (James Marsden) from marrying Giselle (Amy Adams). Narissa pushes her through a portal which sends her into the real world. She finds herself popping out of a manhole in the middle of Time Square. Divorce lawyer Robert Philip (Patrick Dempsey) takes pity on the clueless princess and lets her stay with him and his daughter Morgan. He decides to marry Nancy Tremaine (Idina Menzel). Prince Edward and chipmunk Pip come through the portal to rescue Giselle. The Queen sends servant Nathaniel (Timothy Spall) over to poison Giselle with apples.Amy Adams is perfect as Giselle. I am not so happy with Patrick Dempsey. He is way too whiny. He is no Prince Charming and they don't really develop the needed chemistry. I love some of funnier moments. Amy is fully committed and the curtains are hilarious. Marsden is just as committed to be completely clueless like Giselle and it is funny to see. They are great fish out of water.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A well done fairy tale,"The first time i watched this movie, i did not enjoy it. The reason: bad quality (hence poor movie experience). I heard it was good but because of my mistake, i did not like it as much as the others did. That was then. Until the television showed this movie recently, i was all in to watch it again, in better quality, and i smiled after watching. Lesson learned.The movie begins with Prince Edward meeting Giselle in a fantasy world, Andalasia, and proposes to marry her. However, his evil stepmother tricked Giselle- as she does not want Prince Edward to marry Giselle and take her throne, into a well which connects to our world, in New York. Unlike her fantasy world, Giselle tries to find her way back to Andalasia to return to the arms of her, then, true love. She meets Robert and soon learns the real meaning of love. In a 'boom' ending, since this is a fairy tale, expect an all's well closure.The cast of the movie is great. Amy Adams has the ideal princess look. The development of the story is well- intertwined with comedy and music. The score and soundtrack is good listen too. The costume is stunning- especially Giselle's. In short, nothing could go wrong with this movie if one looks for an escape into a true fairy tale type story- and if you believe in happy endings!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney is back!,"There is little more I could add to the stellar comments and reviews for this film. While it is not perfect (probably some expository songs were cut out to reduce time, particularly in the case of secondary characters), it left me smiling and happy, and I even bought the soundtrack on iTunes. One thing I didn't notice mentioned (probably it was noted elsewhere) was that in the beginning Giselle and Edward defeated an evil troll. Isn't this a reference to the upstart Shrek? I love how, instead of making fun of Disney lore this film gently nudges it and updates it. I hope the very tired Disney fairy tale mocking genre is slain by this film.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Enjoyable fairy tale frolic, if you're not too cynical or damning...","New York City divorce lawyer and single dad Patrick Dempsey chances to meet distressed storybook princess Amy Adams, a once-animated maiden who has become mortal after being pushed into the real world by a wicked queen. Instead of a fish-out-of-water fairy tale from Walt Disney Pictures, we get a cartoon character turned three-dimensional...add songs, homages to Disney classics, plus a computer-generated squirrel (for slapstick value) and you've got the makings of a pleasant, if top-heavy, romantic comedy for eleven-year-old girls. Some of the humor is a bit too outrageous (I could have done without the bathtub-scrubbing cockroaches), but Dempsey and Adams really put their hearts into this sugar-coated scenario and give us an attractive, appealing couple worth swooning over. The animated prologue is fun, and Susan Sarandon is a perfect villainess, although Bill Kelly's screenplay is a little short on genuine supporting characters: the entire picture seems to take place in a vacuum, with the Big Apple residents (minus one ticked-off bus driver) under some sort of catatonic spell. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Practically Perfect,"The movie is quite simply, the best Family movie in the past few years. From the beginning, the movie sucks you in with narration from a Disney Legend. You fall in love with the characters right away and it's quite simply a return to the greatness that Disney can deliver. The cast led by Amy Adams, Patrick Dempsey, James Marsden and Timothy Spall (Wormtail from the Harry Potter movies who gives an inspired Oscar-worthy performance) is impeccable. Rounding out the cast is Susan Sarandon who is part Evil Queen, part Maleficent and pure EVIL and the adorable Rachel Covey who is the perfect ""mini-princess"" for Giselle to play off of. The music by Stephen Schwartz and Alan Menken (in a return to brilliance) is terrific. The original songs are the best to come out of Disney since The Hunchback of Notre Dame. The story, quite simply is part fish-out-of-water, part romantic comedy, part animated and all fun. The live-action portion of the movie feels like your watching animation. The way that Giselle infects those around her with her innocent ""Princess-esque"" demeanor is really at the heart of what makes the movie so great. Of course, it wouldn't be Disney without a few scene-stealing animals who don't take over the movie and really are what they are meant to be, supporting characters. There are a few nods to the past as well. I won't share them here, but let's just say they are subtle enough not to be distracting, but still there enough to bring a smile to your face. The violence in the movie is nothing more than what you would see in any other PG family movie, and really aside from being live-action, isn't anything you wouldn't see in movies such as Sleeping Beauty or Snow White.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
How enchanting is it?,"""Enchanted"" pulls off an interesting duality. It deftly and entertainingly punctures the twee conventions of one heavily-genrefied type of film with one hand, while with the other it drives full-speed into the conventions of another. While the parody of the children's fairytale cartoon is effective and very funny in its own right, it also casts a bit of ironic, non-normative light on the ""romcom"" clichés that ""Enchanted"" simultaneously engages in.It's a very witty movie with a clever script, and more than the requisite number of funny lines and situations are drawn from the innocent-abroad conceit of a cartoon fairytale princess (and, secondarily, prince and villainous lackey) transplanted into a complex modern world. The wit of the script is complemented and in many senses the film is really made by a very good lead performance from Amy Adams as Giselle, who has superb comic timing and does an excellent job of treading a difficult line -- giving her character the requisite level of exaggerated innocence and saccharinity while keeping the character well- rounded well-rounded, interesting, and likable enough to carry the film.The musical numbers as well are very well done -- fully-fledged large- scale production numbers admirable in their own right and as clever as the rest of the script in their contrasting of old-fashioned over-the- top musical styling with real-word cynicisms and banalities.When that same real-world resolves with a storybook ending all'round, the film succeeds in being as sweet as it likes, but something doesn't settle right in terms of tone and the stability of the worlds that have been established. On the whole, though, the film is pulled off with a lot of panache and a well-written script that does its concept justice.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A great, fun, Disney classic!","First off, I want to say that, there is a comment on this thread where someone calls Enchanted disturbing, should be rated R, etc. It is obvious she did not see the film. This reviewer is high, and, this review should be removed.Enchanted was a surprisingly great, fun modernized Cinderella tale, including 3 show- stopping musical numbers where the test audience applauded after each song.Amy Adams is perfect, James Marsden, once again, as he was in Hairspray, was very appealing. I felt Patrick Dempsey was good, if not a tad old for the part, and, his fiancé was OK, nothing spectacular. (in fact, I feel this movie would have worked a bit better if Dempsey had a good girl ""friend"" vs a fiancé).That being said, I loved the message this movie teaches to children, that is, get to know someone before saying ""i do"" (as is the message with way too many princess movies, and is the reason why too many suffer youthful failed marriages.Enchanted was great fun, and very funny!

Amy Adams is Enchanting!,"A classic Disney fairytale collides with modern-day New York City in a story about a fairytale princess from the past who is thrust into present-day by an evil queen. Soon after her arrival, Princess Giselle begins to change her views on life and love after meeting a handsome lawyer. Can a storybook view of romance survive in the real world?I was quite embarrassed to see myself in a crowd of mothers and children while watching the film. Still, I wouldn't mind since I knew this was going to be a good movie. Was I right? Yes but it did fell below my expectations. The whole concept felt like another film released this year. It was called ""Happily N'ever After"" and that had a much better sense of humor because there were some jokes the adults could enjoy.The jokes in this film were pretty basic and childish and maybe a few that were laugh-out-loud. But this film in't about the comedy, right? Well, for the most part, this is a very cute, entertaining, although sometimes dragging a bit, and for the whole family to enjoy.Yes, the movie is predictable but the main reason why this movie worked, and I know people would agree, is because of Amy Adams! If another actress would take her spot, it wouldn't have been much successful as it is right now. She is just magical in her role, which was really good. James Marsden, Susan Sarandon, and Patrick Dempsey all played their role really well too.The songs in here are a bit cheesy and overly cute, although it wasn't anything special.

After all, I am a real softie and like romantic films--what about teenage boys, guys who only cry at John Wayne flicks or rabid feminists?

The animated sequences were lovely, with bright colourful backgrounds, and the live action ones are beautifully shot. The music, by surprise surprise Alan Menken was surprisingly good, taking inspiration from Disney classics like Snow White, Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty. I particularly loved the production number in the park. The script is fresh and funny, and the actors look as though they are having fun, making the film refreshingly irreverent, if perhaps a little silly. I also thought the performances were excellent, Amy Adams was beautiful and perfectly charming as Princess Giselle,(sounds like something out of a ballet), and James Marsden was actually tolerable here as Edward. Sure, he mayn't be the most likable of all the princes ever, but he was funny at times. Patrick Dempsey was also good as Robert, who Giselle meets in New York, and in some way he falls in love with her. Timothy Spall has his moments as Nathanial, and while I personally wouldn't associate Susan Sarandon with villainous roles, she was great as the villainous Narissa, who banishes Giselle to New York. Though, my favourite character has to be Pip the chipmunk, he was not only sweet but absolutely hilarious. The scene when he tries to tell Edward of Nathanial(and impersonating him), culminating in him swaying about singing the love theme, had my whole family in hysterics. I loved Enchanted with its quirky performances, fast pace and engaging dialogue, though I will say the film in't without a flaw. (yes almost every single film I've seen has at least one)The film's only flaw is that the CGI Dragon finale was slightly overblown. Other than that, a simply delightful film, that kids and adults will enjoy. 9/10 Bethany Cox.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Overly charming, camp-filled fun","Bravo to Walt Disney Co. for having the guts and brains to make fun of itself and then go ahead and make lots of money off of it. This is a really fun comedy that combines both the magic of Disney pre-21st century with a 21st century sense of humor. It's also not too heavy on any one of the things it tries to be: it's not too musical-heavy, romance-heavy or joke- heavy--it really caters to all ages and both genders (though girls are more likely to appeal to it at first). This is one of the first things Disney has done in awhile (other than stay with Pixar) that deserves applause.""Enchanted"" is a live action/animated mix that attempts to show what happens when Disney's animated ""happily ever after"" world collides with modern-day ""never happy"" New York. It's a clever concept that unlocks a mostly fresh set of jokes to be made. Combine that with a few first-rate songs written by Disney master Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz, the genius behind ""Wicked,"" and you have something special.Giselle is a typical ""Disney Princess"" from animated land Andalasia looking for her true love who is Prince Edward. The evil Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon) of course wants them never to be happy and banishes Giselle to New York where she is played by Amy Adams. Edward (James Marsden) goes after her as does Narissa's squire Nathaniel (Timothy Spall) and a chipmunk named Pip. Giselle is discovered by a divorce attorney played by Patrick Dempsey who has some relationship issues of his own and both our way of life and Giselle's love-filled naive way of life clash.Amy Adams is the far and away standout of the film, though Dempsey does do well as your pretty standard ""i don't believe in fairy tales"" kind of guy. Adams convinces you so easily she's from an animated world. Marsden does this well too, but Adams runs away with your affections. Her characterization never cracks and she beautifully shows us her character's inner transformation as she falls for Dempsey and subsequently our world. Her skill makes a pretty cheesy romantic-comedy plot seem special and different.This is a really feel-good, fun story that even though it plays out like any fairytale formula, still works and doesn't turn you off to enjoying the end. It is a very clear-cut we learn how to believe in love more and the fairytale characters learn to be more realistic and that both can live in harmony...all that good stuff. It's just a really positive way to spend 100 minutes.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Amy Adams hides the flaws,"Firstly let me be clear that I'm not a kid and I didn't watch this movie with kids so, although I personally found the movie too flawed to give more than a 6, my comments are really only relevant for adult viewers.Whilst watching I mostly enjoyed it apart from the huge inconsistencies in its message about ""one true love"". Of course I don't expect serious philosophy in a children's film but you wouldn't have to be the brightest kid in the world to get a vague feeling that something doesn't quite add up. The other weak point was the rather poor scripting for the villain: Traditionally the villain is one of the strong points of a Disney cartoon but the wicked step mother's ideas for how to get rid of Giselle are so feeble they carry no menace whatsoever.The more I think about this film afterwards the more I see it as a perfect performance by Amy Adams covering up a third rate script. The scene where the ""real"" animals clean the apartment was also very good but with hindsight it just seems as though it was bolted on.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Delightful Fairytale with Happily Ever After,"Once upon a time in the magic kingdom of Andalasia, the evil Queen Narissa does not want to lose her position of queen and consequently that her stepson Prince Edward finds a girl. When Edward meets the dreamer Giselle, they immediately fall in love with each other and decide to get married on the next day. However, Narissa disguises in an old witch and lures Giselle, pushing her down in a magic wishing well that brings Giselle (Amy Adams) to the real world in Times Square in Manhattan. Giselle does not find anyone gentle and is completely lost in the cold and rainy New York trying to find the way back to Andalasia. However, the divorce lawyer Robert Philip (Patrick Dempsey) and his daughter Morgan Philip (Rachel Covey) help Giselle and she spends the night in their apartment. Meanwhile Prince Edward (James Marsden) and his squirrel Pip jumps in the well and arrives in Times Square seeking out Giselle. But Queen Narissa sends his minion Nathaniel (Timothy Spall) yo New York with a poisoned apple to kill Giselle. Robert, who is engaged of Nancy (Idina Menzel), becomes fascinated with the naive and lovely Giselle that falls in love with him. But her prince charming is in the real world to bring Giselle back to Andalasia.""Enchanted is a delightful fairytale and a wonderful family entertainment. I have just watched this film because of the name gorgeous of Amy Adams in the lead role and the advice of my daughter that told me how marvelous ""Enchanted"" is. I do not understand the bad reviews of this film and I really feel sorry for someone that is so bitter and cold-hearted that does not enjoy an adorable fairytale that ends with ""happily ever after"".

A Disney movie about a princess that isn't only for little girls,"(58%) A good fun fish-out-of-water family comedy. The overly purposeful sweet elements offer some decent laughs, and the Simpsons-esque song routine with the rats and flies cleaning the apartment is very clever, a true highlight. The only issues for me are the sweetness levels going a bit too far at times, and Amy Adams character losing her identity and usual characteristics towards the end of the film for little reason why like an on/off switch had been pressed between scenes. Little girls will love it, while everyone else over the age of 12 will be surprised they aren't hating every second of it. A worthy Disney offering for the good pile.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Light entertainment,"Yeah, I saw it. I wasn't expecting much, apart from some light entertainment, and that's just what I got. It's pretty funny, and surprisingly witty at times, and I enjoyed all the nods to prior Disney works, but it's just too corny at times. I would have liked it if it had played more on the Disney formula instead of falling into it. The songs are fine, though the one at the ball is completely out of place and took me right out of the film. Marsden is probably the highlight, as he doesn't take his role too seriously and looks to be having a lot of fun. Amy Adams is great to look at, but her 'aw shucks' performance eventually got on my nerves. I didn't find it as charming as everyone else did, apparently. Overall, the film's not terrible, but it's nothing special.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Classic storytelling blended perfectly with modern reality,"I'm not in this movie's target demographic. I'm a guy aged 24-30. Yet the preview sucked me in, and I'm glad I did. Why? It's a movie that tells us a little about ourselves, and makes fun of how we distinguish fantasy from reality and why we hold onto our dreams.We all want the fairy tale to come true, but as we get older, we learn that reality is much less beautiful than the idealized world of Disney fantasy. This movie plays to that duality expertly, examining what we believe, asking us why, and making us laugh along the way.Giselle the would-be princess will win you over with her idealist naiveté. She steals scenes with her energetic personality, and makes you wish you believed how she does. Her musical scene while cleaning house will have you laughing along as fantasy and reality clash in a brilliant mockery.Prince Edward will have you rooting for the wrong guy because he's just so likable. He's played by James Marsden, aka Scott from the X-Men (who was a dick), which really showcases his versatility. He can sing, dance, and play naive romantic to a T.Patrick Dempsey once again removes himself from the limelight with a too low-key performance, but he's the straight guy that grounds the film, so that's the point. He still changes as Giselle's giddy make believe world intrudes on his life and the way he thinks, so you get to feel for him as if he were you.By the end of the film you'll find yourself wondering if you still believe in the fairy tale style romance, or if you're a modern realist. The best part is, this movie gives you that choice.Everybody comes out a winner from this film, including the audience. It's a perfect date movie, unless you don't like who you're dating, in which case it'll be really awkward, because this movie is unrelentingly romantic.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Overrated,"This is a slightly amusing movie, but it certainly doesn't deserve 8 stars. The concept behind the story is an excellent and very original idea, but the final product could have had a little more thought and effort put into it. The relations between characters are rarely believable. The story seems as though it wants to be taken seriously (it throws in a few little plot twists to distinguish it from the typical straight-forward fairy-tale), but it's difficult to do so because the writing, directing, and acting leave much to be desired in terms of believability. There are a few redeeming moments of brief hilarity though. Don't miss the scene in which the squirrel, lacking his former ability to speak, attempts to mime an important message about a poisoned apple.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Get real already!,"First of all, I'm going to tell you that I'm a 16 year old girl, so this review may be a little biased in your opinion. For the most part, the reviews for Enchanted have been stellar. I enjoyed reading them, and agreed with most of them, until I got to the end where a few wet blankets decided to ruin the rave reviews. They think there's too much marketing, the marriage/divorce issues aren't appropriate..the list goes on.I don't know about anyone else, but I thought Enchanted was so cute. Sure, it was really glammed up and glitzy, but it's a Disney princess movie. What else could you expect? As far as the marriage/divorce issue goes, I really don't believe 6 year old girls are sitting in the movie theater to watch anything but the princess and listen to the music, etc. I really think some people are reeling too far into the issues of this movie, instead of simply enjoying it.Enchanted was one of the best movies of the year in my opinion. It was funny, romantic, and just plain good. It even made me cry at the end! I really enjoyed it, and I would recommend it for kids of all ages.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A New Kind of Fairytale...,"With Enchanted, Disney returns to really good family film-making. More recently, the studio has been releasing dumb very immature ""comedies"" such as The Game Plan. Enchanted does what some were beginning to think Disney could no longer do: appeal to the adult audience coming with the kids.Giselle is an animated princess-to-be on her way to her wedding to Prince Edward when his Stepmother Queen pushes her into a black pit in a desperate attempt to hold on to the crown. Giselle is sent into the most terrifying world of all: Ours. She is rescued by Robert, an engaged father who doesn't believe in love- but Giselle must of course fix that. Problem: our Princess is soon followed by her lover Prince, his servant, and eventually the Queen herself... and New York will never be the same.Amy Adams stars as Giselle in this fairy tale with a twist, and star is indeed what she does. Her energy flows from the screen in an irresistible and delightful way. There is talk of an Oscar nomination for Ms. Adams, and I must say I would agree with it. She pokes fun at the classic Disney princesses at the same time as respecting them and becoming an icon herself. The rest of the cast all supports nicely, James Marsden sticking out particularly as Prince Edward. Mr. Marsden is one of my favorite comedic actors, and he's at his best here.And of course it's a story about love, promoting happily ever after blatantly. What makes Enchanted special, though, is that the characters debate the reality and even need for happily ever after in today's world. Giselle is thrust into a modern day that doesn't instantly accept true love as natural or even possible and she can't understand this. Where she comes from, chance romance equals true love. ""Let's be married tomorrow!"" cries her Prince two minutes after she meets him. In this new world, though, people aren't so easy to believe. Giselle is desperate to convince everyone around her that love is forever, though they're very reluctant to accept it- and that's what makes it brilliant. For the first time, Disney isn't all instantly happy endings and true love with a prince. For the first time the Princess begins to realize that love is flawed and imperfect; but that doesn't make it any less of love.At heart, Enchanted is a light-hearted comedy/musical that fits nicely into Disney's other such films. It's filled with good morals, good-hearted characters, and good clean humor. But it also discusses what real love is all about, a subject Disney has been a bit overly optimistic about in the past. That's a lot to pack into a little kid flick. 7/10 stars!Jay Addison",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Fun, enjoyable, but lots of room for improvement","Well, obviously, this movie is directed towards young children. Amy Adams gives a charming performance as the main lead, Dempsey and Marsden did alright too. I definitely wouldn't say this is a bad film, but there is lots of room for improvement. Let me start with the good: Good characters, great musical numbers, a likable lead with a great performance, and overall great art direction. Now for the bad: First of all, I thought that the 3rd act was kind of messy, especially with the main antagonist who was a little uninteresting, and the writing itself felt very unprofessional. In a nutshell, it's engaging, fun, and overall enjoyable, but it may appeal better to younger kids and people who don't mind some bad writing.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"'You've Met Your Match, You Foul Bellowing Beast!'","Disney comes up with a charming little movie. 'Enchanted' starts with the old fashioned animation that was evident in Disney classics. This animated sequence cleverly parodies other Disney fairy tales. Then after about 20 minutes or so into the movie, the characters enter our New York City. What follows are hilarious events of culture shock, discovery, singing, love and friendship.Bill Kelly's writing and Kevin Lima's direction are technically very good. The lines are great and the way the actors deliver them only highlight the humour. I only had a problem with the love angle. It just didn't engage me as a viewer. Perhaps it's because of the chemistry between Amy Adams and Patrick Dempsey. Amy Adams is lovely and transcendent. She shows her characters transformation brilliantly but Patrick Dempsey is hardly convincing. At best, he's strictly okay. I didn't know that Timothy Spall was in the movie but when I saw the animated version of Nathaniel,I was thinking how much he resembled Spall and of course, he is Spall. James Marsden steals the show. I'm starting to like this actor very much as he really gets under the skin of the characters he plays and does nothing short of a fine job. A barely recognizable Susan Sarandon rounds it off with her strong presence and she pulls it off with ease. And, of course Julie Andrews lends her welcoming voice as the narrator.The animation is impressive and it reminds one of the classics Disney used to gift. The special effects and visuals are stunning. The songs are funny to watch. Cinematography is good.'Enchanted' works well as a family film. Kids will surely love it. The only thing that didn't appeal to me was Giselle and Robert's love story. Otherwise it was a pleasant viewing.",,Anonymous,Animation

loads of fun!,"This is one of my favourite Disney productions for a long time. And how could it fail? Enchanted takes all the most magical ingredients of a fairy tale and mixes them with a few modern truths like divorce, dirt and OTT publicity stunts.Sparkling Amy Adams easily steals the show. A princess, she is pushed down a well by her evil soon-to-be stepmother (Susan Sarandon) and finds herself in the heart of New York City. As she searches for her Prince Charming in Manhattan's grimy streets she never stops smiling and makes friends  and dresses- along the way.Far from being nauseatingly smiley, Adams is utterly believable and had a room full of critics laughing throughout; and even prompted applause at the end. My favourite part has to be the Marry Poppins inspired cleaning scene, where cute bunnies are replaced by urban rats and cockroaches! Being from the generation of 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' and given the advancement of special effects, I found the occasional animation somewhat unnecessary. However, I have no doubt that director Kevin Lima has created a movie that will put young and old under a glorious, candy floss spell, restoring everyone's belief in happily ever afters.The Fan Carpet - www.thefancarpet.com",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Amy Adams is Absolutely Perfect!,"Let me first preface that I have a predisposition for enjoying Disney animated films. I'm not sure if its the child in me, or the fairy-tale stories, or what; but for whatever reason, I have a rather large soft spot for them. Enchanted is no different and has not swayed me from my position a bit. It left me wanting so much more. At first I was concerned with how the transition from animation to live action would really look like on screen, but my fears soon faded away the first time I saw Amy Adams pop out of a sewer in a giant wedding dress. How marvelous and enchanting she truly is, I thought; and how animated! How absolutely animated she is! It's really as if the cartoon has come to life--as if the New York City backdrop is just that, a fabricated, foreign backdrop. And then she started talking... And her voice, her facial expressions, everything: completely animated. After the film, David and Yen told me I absolutely had to see Junebug, and I certainly will after this performance. She shined the entire time on screen and she sold me. I actually believed she was really from some fairy-tale, animated world where dreams come true and everyone lives happily ever after. I loved her so much, I'm not even going to mention the other performances other than to say they were adequate and took nothing away from the film. I'll also note that the Central Park musical number is to die for.I will, however, take a brief look at the story as well. I know what you're thinking: some cheese ball romantic-comedy mush that's over-the-top and kid stuff, right? Well, think again. This story is all grown up, philosophically and realistically. I really liked the existential observations the characters made, being in this odd conundrum. Both they and we learn something about love and fairy-tales; about reality and fantasy; but above all, we learn that it's ultimately a compromise between the two that finds us all true genuine happiness, forever... and ever.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney on Disney,"I think that after watching Julie Taymor's ""Across the Universe"" you start living with the idea that you may not find music, dancing and acting so perfectly combined in a film these days. But if you haven't watched it, you will have plenty of things to find in ""Enchanted"", the real life fable of all the Snowhites, Sleeping Beauties, Ariels, Cinderellas but not Anastacias.Here the magical world of Walt Disney brings a film that brings everything back to life again. I like it because it's such an uncompromising film; so simple and predictable, and it knows it. However, it also knows that it's a film that had to be done and had a reason for existing (in case anyone had thought differently): making the viewer remember. Whether you are 10 years old, 25 or 50 or more, you'll get something of this movie that will stay with you forever.The 10-year-olds will be astonished by the musical sequences in the best ""Mary Poppins"" style, the songs (they may not have shined at the Oscars, but Alan Menken's melodies are as sharp as ever and you can't help to smile while watching people in the middle of the street singing ""That's how you know""; look for the video if you don't believe me), the animals and the always winning tale of the princess looking for his true love.The 25-year-olds will recognize every moment taken from another animated classic (this is Disney on Disney people) and the parallels established with the film's characters and some of the most beloved Disney villains and heroes of all time; while the 50-year-olds will just experience a short ride in a time machine, which I'm guessing it's no so bad.""Enchanted"" is short, direct and targeted like no other Disney film this decade. The young girls will get it to see Patrick Dempsey and James Marsden (the latter one truly delivers and proves to have a natural singing talent); the whole family will get it because it's Disney, movie lovers will want to see Susan Sarandon doing a villain and, believe it or not, the boys will eventually watch it because everyone will be talking good things about it; and about Amy Adams.And why wouldn't they? She's lovable and manages to control her performance so that it never becomes annoying, something that could have easily happened. The movie rests on her natural gift, her singing and on her smile and on the commitment of director Kevin Lima, who once directed the animated classic ""A Goofy Movie""; a film that everyone should watch once more.Oh, and just in case: ""Bridge to Terabithia"" this is not.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Fun, but poor editing","Thoroughly enjoyed Amy Adams and Rachel Covey. Patrick Dempsey seemed distracted from the story until the lifesaving kiss.Why the abrupt editing cut with Giselle in the background of Nancy's clothing design shop? It's an important story line, finished without explanation at the end of the story. The cut goes to a relatively minor story of the reconciliation of the divorcing couple. There were several other abrupt cuts where the story was not so interrupted, but nevertheless rough cuts.At the Kings and Queens Ball, Giselle's formal dress is beautiful, but out of context of other dancers in historic costume. The princess garb she had designed for herself fit the context.The PG rating caption before the film cautioned against a smoking scene, which I never saw, unless it was the wicked witch transformed to a dragon.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Yes, I actually watched this. (A review of ""Enchanted."")","Because while I have a love of horror movies, I also have high school friends with small children.She REFUSES to let me show her three girls the whimsical magic of ""Donnie Darko,"" even though that film is clearly appropriate for children. (It has a talking rabbit.) So the five of us watched 2007's ""Enchanted,"" and I liked it a lot. Because the laughter of little girls can be infectious after a long day.If you're an adult, you can have good fun watching Disney lampoon its own clichés, all the while avoiding them — the gently spurned would- be stepmother here, for example, isn't ""wicked."" The fish- out-of water humor of a Disney princess inhabiting the ""real world"" is accessible to adults. And Susan Sarandon is a pleasure to watch in any film — I actually never realized before what a great voice she has until I heard it connected with her animated equivalent here. (The movie is bookended by animated segments.)You can also have great fun trying to recognize the genteel characters as actors you've seen in other movies. The bubbly, clueless princess here is none other than the reserved, highly intelligent Lois Lane in ""Man of Steel"" (Amy Adams). I spent the whole film trying to figure out who the prince is, until I realized it was Cyclops of without his visor (James Marsden). And the character of Nathaniel is none other than Timothy Spall, who every film fan will recognize as Thomas Tipp from the priceless ""Vanilla Sky."" Spall is also in another group of movies  apparently there is this really popular film franchise about a boy wizard? (It might be based on a book series.)Seriously, this is a fun, safe movie for small children that you can also enjoy with them.Since the girls liked this so much, I am going to screen ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" for them if my friend lets me babysit.

"I was ""Enchanted""","Disney's magic is finally back. After so many inane, by the numbers movies by the once great studio, they come up with a wonderful, simple, poignant musical romantic animated comedy spoof, I know, all those genres wrapped into one might sound like a messy stew, but it's anything but, it is altogether wonderful.When I first saw the campaign for the film I though like many out there ""Gee, what will Disney think of next to squeeze bucks out of parents with small kids and girls that go gaga over Princesses?"" After a couple of months, I've seen the film 3 times, and was ""Enchanted"" with it, from start to finish.Probably the two best elements in the film are the screenplay, which did a wonderfully clever spoof on all the Disney mythology we've grown with since Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Kudos to newcomer writer Bill Kelly.The other fantastic element is the tour De force performance from it's leading lady, Amy Adams. A great actress in the making, sort of reminds me of Diane Keaton, for her corky choice of characters, and the corky choices she makes with her characters. I first came upon her in Spielberg's Catch Me if You Can, she caught my eye as an interesting actress. Years later, with already an Academy Nomination under her belt, she is proving herself to be a great actress. Her comedic timing, her range, her screen presence, and her surprising vocal and dancing skills amazed me, and totally locked the film, she might be the most important cog of the whole production.The cast was altogether fantastic, Grey's Anatomy Patrick Dempsey was a smart choice, James Marsden was brilliant as Adams counterpart, it's always a pleasure to see Susan Sarandon, and Timothy Spall was a delight, surpassing his apparent character actor persona, established by his collaborations with Tom Cruise. Idina Menzel was slightly underused, being the great Broadway vocal she is, she could have had a musical number, or record a song, but she was great nonetheless.Speaking of Broadway, they really hit the spot on me with all the Broadway locations, displaying such signs as Hairspray, Chicago, The Color Purple and The Producers. The film does play out as a wonderful Disney Broadway musical. And though the film is not as mesmerizing as Beauty and the Beast(I leave that price to Brad Bird's Ratatouille), Enchanted is wonderful on it's own terms.Kevin Lima also did some clever directorial choices, like changing film format from Academy Ratio to Widescreen, to classic by the book Jerome Robbins choreography and staging(that comes full force with the showstopper ""That's How you Know"").The score is the cherry on top, it's was fantastic to hear, finally, a new score from Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz, they were connected with Disney's Golden Era of Late 80s, and 90s, we owe many of the classic Disney scores like Beauty and The Beast, Aladdin and The Little Mermaid to them, it was amazing to have them back, with a killer score, that shows they have not lost their touch for music and lyrics, all of the themes are inspired, and the songs stick with you, Kudos you masters, you guys pulled through yet again, I smell a classic.Although it's early, I would definitely call Enchanted the surprise of the year, a film that from it's campaign seemed dull, predictable and by the numbers, but showed me and many people wrong.Disney and Pixar seem to have trouble with their marketing team, Ratatouille had the same problems with it's campaign, let's hope they can learn from this year.I highly recommend Enchanted, let's hope it will ""enchant"" you as it did me.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The reason why everyone loves Disney.,"Brilliant!! I thought Disney makes fun of itself about the gap between its own taste and the real world in this movie. But it was more nice than I expected!Giselle behaved like so princesses even though she was in the real. She reacted to everything exaggeratedly. It turned the others off. They replied to a drama princesses cynically. But it meant Disney creators made it while saying something, right? If so, I feel a sense of closeness with them. Giselle called 'her friends' from the forest and put even a cockroach on her fingers. You know, it's made by Disney!

It's Nice to See That Disney Can Make Fun of Itself,"A cute and diverting Disney film that pokes fun at other Disney films.Amy Adams does fine work as a cartoon princess named Giselle who is banished to that frightening, sinister world otherwise known as New York City by an evil queen (Susan Sarandon) who doesn't want her marrying her dashing stepson, Prince Edward (James Marsden), and stealing her crown away from her. Giselle winds up in the care of Patrick Dempsey (who's come a long way since his days as a gigolo pizza delivery guy in ""Loverboy""), an uptight divorce attorney who doesn't believe in true love. Giselle of course, in true Disney princess fashion, believes in nothing else, and the two fall predictably in love, much to the dismay of Edward, who has followed Giselle to New York.Much of the humor in ""Enchanted"" revolves around contrasting fairytale mannerisms and beliefs to the, shall we say slightly more jaded, attitudes of modern-day New York. Giselle and Edward are both completely lacking in irony or sarcasm, and don't understand feelings like anger or scorn. They both also have a habit of breaking out into big production numbers at the most inopportune times, which provides the film with its highlights. When Giselle wants to clean up a messy apartment, she enlists the help of God's creatures, just like Snow White did so many years ago, but the ones that show up here are pigeons, rats, roaches and an army of flies. It would be easy to dismiss Adams' performance as unchallenging, but I think it would take a lot of skill to carry a movie like this, and she does it well. Marsden is also quite funny as the pompous prince with gleaming white teeth. Demspey is kind of droopy, while Susan Sarandon hams things up as the wicked stepmother. The film grows rather tiresome by its conclusion; the filmmakers can't resist a CGI showdown between the queen (in the guise of a giant purple dragon) and our lovers. But overall it left me entertained.Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"So sweet, you'd think it would make you sick... but it doesn't.","When I read that Harry Knowles, the founder of ""Aintitcoolnews.com"" apparently never heard of Amy Adams before this movie, I was flabbergasted, because a known movie-geek like him with his own website rivaling IMDb never heard of her, and yet I still remember her as the sex-starved Marvel Ann in ""Psycho Beach Party."" I also remember some trailers & promos earlier in the year indicating she was going to play the princess in this movie, and from what I heard about it, I thought it was going to be mildly amusing. What I didn't expect was to fall head over heels for her character, her movie, and her.The evil Queen Narissa(Susan Sarandon) of Andalasia wants to do everything she can to keep her son Prince Edward(James Marsden) from finding love, because that means he will marry the girl of his dreams and she'll have to give up her throne. Gee, I can't imagine why, since Queen Elizabeth II hasn't given up her throne whenever her kids got married. Anyway, in the fairy-tale world of Andalasia, couples can fall in love in a day, and sweet girl like Giselle can summon animals with a song to her hollow tree-house, and land in the arms of the prince of her dreams while trying to flee from a troll that was going to eat her. Also, wicked queens can transform themselves into dragons or old hags and trick blushing brides into making it easier to push them into seemingly bottomless water fountains.The Queen tells her minion, and would-be lover(Timothy Spall) that she sent Giselle to a world where there are no happy endings... ours. Specifically contemporary Times Square in New York City. What a wimp! If that queen wanted to send her to a real nightmare, she should've pushed Giselle into the Times Square of the 1970's! Either way, when she arrives in the no longer animated world, she finds out just how rotten things can be. Meanwhile, a single father named Robert Phillip(Patrick Demsey) who works as a divorce lawyer tries to convince his six-year-old daughter Morgan(Rachel Covey) that she should accept the upcoming marriage to his girlfriend, Nancy(Idina Menzel). Suddenly, they stumble upon this apparently disturbed young woman in a funny-looking outfit trying to get into a billboard shaped like a castle. Yes, I'm talking about Giselle, the pretty young thing who was on the verge of marrying into Andalasian royalty. Originally, he just wants to call a cab to send her to the Port Authority Bus Terminal, but something about this kooky-lady intrigues him, so he let's her stay for the night.The next morning, our would-be princess decides to tidy his apartment up by summoning rats, mice, cockroaches, and pigeons, inadvertently convinces his would-be fiancé to think he's having an affair with another woman, makes a new dress out of the man's curtains, and upon learning about the concept of divorce, desperately convinces a splitting couple to get back together. Fortunatley, this couple doesn't have a violent relationship, because if they did, one partner would be in serious trouble. At the same time, Prince Edward and Giselle's squirrel-friend Pip dives into the well to rescue the Princess, and Narissa coaxes her minion into trying to stop them. And all three have as hard of time adjusting to the real world as Giselle. When Robert tries to send her into Central Park with some money for a trip to wherever, she gives it away to an old lady feeding pigeons, and he joins her for a stroll to discuss the way love really works. From there, Giselle bursts out into song on cue. When a calypso band joins her in the song, Robert's reply is ""How do you all know this song? I've never heard this song before!"" If he came to my house, he'd hear a lot of songs he never knew existed before, and so would you. Soon enough, all of Central Park joins her performance. And to think last night, they were writing her off as a crazy lady in a funny costume, like Robert is. After all, the girl is certifiable... certifiably adorable.In a flop-house apparently in Harlem, Prince Edward & Nathaniel discover television, including soap operas with former Disney characters as members of the cast. I like how a line from the soap makes Nathaniel doubt the morality of the mission the queen sent him on. It's also hard to ignore how the real world rubs off on Giselle, and some aspects of Andalasia inadvertently begin to effect Robert's fiancé Nancy.Still, it's Amy Adams that makes the movie worth watching, despite the fact that her cutesy voice is as fake as hell. Very little can be said about her as Giselle that hasn't been said before. She's so sweet, she makes Stacy Rowe look like Sandi Griffin(I just can't get away from those ""Daria"" references, can I?). Whereas Jennifer Garner was a delight in a non-delightful movie like ""13 Going On 30,"" Adams is a delight in an equally delightful movie. Absolutely not to be missed.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Amy Adams' acting is amazing. ""Oh! you forgot about happily ever after""","Before my uncle introduced this movie, I didn't care about Disney. But this movie made me change my mind.When I was introduced to this movie, I thought Disney things were childish and stupid. However, I now don't think this movie is just childish or stupid.I initially underestimated this movie. Anyway, as I continued, my attention was drawn. First of all, Amy Adams's acting was amazing and looked so real. Some may even be true. She is a genius who stole my heart.Her expressions, voices, and how she moves, speaks, and dances Her innocent smile, in particular, struck me as genuine. Secondly, there are many funny, humorous moments with the characters and fine behaviours of the characters. Finally, of course, songs and dances were enjoyable. These factors kept me entertained. Especially the dance (her move) around 49:58 was skillful and clever. Amy Adams is either (maybe both) an innocent woman like Giselle or a genius with a clever mind. Even though this movie was released the year I was born, she stole my heart. If Amy Adams is okay with that, Disney should include Amy Adams/Giselle in the official Disney princess lineup. Her acting is so clever that I can't get her out of my mind.The old men in the park are from Mary Poppins. I haven't seen Mary Poppins, but it's nice, isn't it?In addition, CG and animation were good. Real actors and actresses and computer-generated characters worked well together. The plot wasn't bad, at least to me; it was rather good. And the closing credits were lovely; the music in the credits was beautiful and variously emotional. The song ""Ever Ever After"" was also nice. Alan Menken and whoever made these songs are so great.Shooting was so nice. I especially like the way the camera is placed behind someone who is interacting with something that is in focus. And sometimes it can be humorous. How sound effects are used and when a scene changes are very well done.Although Giselle/Amy Adams was distinctive, scenes with Prince Edward, Pip, and Nathaniel, such as the scene at the Grand Duke Hotel, were entertaining. How Nathaniel adopted a big city, New York City, was amusing. The scene when he leaves the hotel seemed like a different movie. The acting of Timothy Spall as Nathaniel and James Marsden as Prince Robert was very good.I felt the acting of Idina Menzel as Nancy and Patrick Dempsey as Robert wasn't as good to me as Amy Adams's acting. But their acting was great enough. The scene when Nancy visits Robert's apartment had the angles changing frequently, and I think that covered her acting. Susan Sarandon's performance as Queen Narissa was excellent, as was the voice acting. To me, Adams' acting was so good that others seemed worse. Maybe they were just supposed to act normally because they are not ""andalasians"".The ball scene might be typical, but it was good and touching. Near the end of the movie, instead of being rescued by a typical strong and brave prince, Giselle is depicted as a brave woman who tries to rescue her beloved, and I really had a good impression. I saw a work that homages the scene of Giselle and Robert slipping off the building.Among Disney films, this one is relatively realistic. A harmony between reality and a fairytale-like story can be seen. Disney has been spreading the dream of marrying a prince for decades, but this movie seems to be telling us it might be wrong.People who are too cynical might not be able to enjoy this movie. Even if you are a cynic, you might enjoy this if you just relax and try to just enjoy it, as I did and could.My father is a scientist who only talks about reality, and my mother hates Disney and ""rats,"" and I followed it. Anyway, this movie gave me a break and changed my mind. I still haven't watched anything about ""rats.""As a boy who was born in the year this movie was released and who was born outside of the US (I am Japanese), I have no shame in approving this movie. I think I like the time period in which I was born. I keep coming back to watch this and the sequel, and both make me calm. But somehow I get sad. I am so joyful that there is a sequel because the movies and TV series I love are usually released before my birth. So it was so so so nice to watch my favourite movie the same year it was released and to see my favourite actors and characters in a recent movie. It has already been 15 years, and I just watched the movie within the past year for the first time. It's hard to accept the fact. I just watched the movie, and now it's been 15 years. Anything never changes in a movie. It's complicated to fall in love with a character or an actor in a movie that was released 15 years ago. Anyway, Amy Adams/ Giselle looked the same in the sequel!(Edit: Today, March, 2023, I just turned 16, and this movie will soon be 16 years old. Even as I and this film grow older, I will never forget this film, its characters, its actors, or this birthday. They cheer me up. And of course, it was nice to watch the movie that I love and that was released in my birth year on my birthday today.)One thing about which I was worried is that Amy Adams didn't have to really put a fish in her mouth. (She didn't; I googled.)I watched this movie when I was depressed. This film reminded me of something important. I will never forget what this film and Giselle showed me. Disney gives us dreams, good or bad.Maybe some people in our entire population are as warmhearted, kind, and innocent as Giselle. I will try to be one of them.This movie, the sequel, Amy Adams, and Giselle are like a lighthouse to me. A lighthouse that shines in the dark and reminds me where to go in the dark ocean. When I get lost in the dark, I seek it out. Even when the light is not there, I shall never forget its brightness and the warmth that I can feel in my heart. Its brightness and warmth remain in my heart. And my eyes remember its brightness. Even when I am having a difficult time in the dark, I shall feel its brightness through my eyes. Even when I am facing the cruelty of society, I shall have its warmth in my heart. A lighthouse that reminds me of where I belong, or should belong, and that keeps reminding me of the land even after I've dared to venture and sail into the dark ocean full of opportunities and risks. When I sail to the ocean, I once again might be alone. But surely stronger and warmer with its brightness and the warmth in my heart. I'll keep sailing until I see you again. I shall keep venturing until I see you again in the hope of acquiring something I still can't give up on.I will never never forget this film; I can't.Thank you to the good filmmakers, actors, and actresses, especially Amy Adams.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
One reluctant thumb up,"I love Patrick Dempsey so I wanted this movie to be great. It just wasn't. The beginning was awkwardly silly (intentionally?) - the animated portion could have used better animation technology. The animation was totally yesterday. If it was supposed to feel like the old Cinderella , it did, but I want sophisticated animation not old flat animation. I felt no chemistry between Giselle & Dempsey and the writing lacked any decent dialogue. I read that some people laughed through the whole thing...at what? I read that there was adult humor...not really. Characters were dull, the story lines undeveloped (the relationship between the queen and her servant, what happened to Dempsey's ex? why did they introduce a gay guy at the apt. door?...) Underwhelming & disappointing.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Just mediocre,"I'm only writing this review because most people, including critics, seem to like this movie, and I'm just wondering why. The idea of the film is quite good, although far from original, this kind of themes have been dealt in numerous films. You'd think the script writers could pull off some really good laughs from the situation of a fairytale princess having to deal with reality, but sadly because this is a middle of the road Disney movie, it newer happens. There's not a single laugh in this film, unless you're very easily entertained.The songs are horrible, trying to mimic their 50s/60s counterparts, but failing. They only stick to your head because they're so bad. The number of plot holes is appalling, even though this is a fantasy film, I'd except at least some suspension of disbelief. How does the fat guy get to work as a cook not once but two times without any of the other staff noticing? Why does no one seem to find their costumes weird? What's with the squirrel, it was badly animated and not funny at all.Even though I hated the film, I've seen worse, but this just doesn't get above mediocrity.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Delightfully romantic fantasy tale,"This film is about a young girl who is about to become a princess in a fantasy land, only to be transported to a modern day strange land by an evil queen.Amy Adams is cute and adorable in her role as a princess-to-be, who is hopelessly lost in the modern day world. Her ways of talking, walking and doing are all fairytale like, making her so convincing as a fantasy character. The cultural clashes of fairytale land and the modern day world are interesting and entertaining to watch. All the costumes and sets are so thoughtful and beautiful. I also like the way that it has come musical elements, which enhances the happy atmosphere. I enjoyed watching ""Enchanted"", as it is such a delightful film.",,Anonymous,Animation
"An excellent Disney parody of Disney, and heartwarming, too!","As soon as I saw the trailer for this movie, I was excited: a Disney movie where they parodied Disney fairy tales? Genius! I saw the movie today, and it did not disappoint. From the traditional animation-style beginning to the live action (the majority of the movie), the story was excellent. Without spoiling any plot details, I will say that both Amy Adams and James Marsden have excellent singing voices, and play their fairy tale characters in the real world with the perfect mixture of magic and ridiculousness. Patrick Dempsey is also surprisingly good as the man Giselle (Amy Adams) meets and whose life she turns upside down.If you're a fan of the old Disney princess movies, and also can appreciate laughing at them (in a way that is also a loving tribute to them), this movie is for you.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Funny in a Bizarre Way,"This was a funny movie because it was so lame, which I think was what they were going for. It was cliché and predictable, but had some very funny moments. Good acting for the most part, but of course there were some things I would change. Some of the songs were admittedly catchy and it had good singing. Perfect if you are under 10.The kids will go crazy for it and the adults will have a good few laughs too, as there are some jokes directed towards adults. Morgan Philip: Remember not to put too much makeup or the boys may get the wrong idea. They are only after one thing. Giselle: What's that? Morgan Philip: I don't know. They won't tell me. That would be one of them. Of course, there are some points where you'd remember, ""Oh, yeah, I remember when I thought like that"" and it will put you in a childish mood. I don't think you'd be wasting your money if you saw this, it was decent. Not the best, like the classics, but admittedly funny and good.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Disney Classic,"The first thing I have to state is that I am a big Disney freak. I grew up watching all the classic Disney Princess movies. My favorite movie of all time is Beauty and the Beast and in my home I have a collection of all these films from Sleeping Beauty to Pocahontas. So I might be biased in my review because this movie is made for people like me.The movie has a simple story line. Giselle (Amy Adams) is about to marry Prince Edward (James Marsden) until his evil stepmother (Susan Sarandon) throws her down a well and she ends up in New York City. She befriends Robert (Patrick Dempsey) and his daughter and they help her on her quest to return home. Anyone who's seen a Disney film can probably figure out the rest. The movie starts out classic Disney style with the old animation that just isn't around anymore. The music and characters are all reminiscent of those movies I know by heart. I didn't feel Enchanted makes fun of these movies but is a sort of homage to them.The performances of this film are all stellar. Amy Adams is wonderfully charming in her role as Giselle. She is truly enchanting and it's practically impossible to not to fall in love with her performance. She is flawless just like you would imagine every Disney Princess would be if you ever met them in real life. James Marsden is the same way, he plays Prince Edward like a true Prince Charming. Patrick Dempsey isn't known as ""McDreamy"" (as nauseating as that nickname is) for nothing. He is truly dreamy and plays Robert perfectly, he may not be the typical Prince Charming but he'll make you fall in love just the same. Susan Sarandon is fine but isn't really the stand-out in the movie.I'm completely geeking out over this movie but if you enjoy watching an uncomplicated love story with no cynicism whatsoever, just some laughs and great musical sequences. Then Enchanted is the movie for you. It's been a long time since I have fallen so head over heels in love with a Disney film so I am very happy this movie came out. See it and fall in love all over again.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
An age old story told in a refreshing new way.,"This is a pretty risky move when you think about it.The film takes an age old storyline,one that Disney has done at least a million times,it seems,and does something totally different with it.It transforms from age old fairy tale to a modern day fish out of water story,and with very entertaining results.The beginning of the film,that is to say the animated part of it,at times appears to be a parody of many of Disney's classic films,but the live action portion of the film makes up for it quite well as these fantasy characters adapt to a totally new world.The film will entertain your children as Disney seldom fails to do,and you yourself will be refreshed to see this age old story told in such a new way.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Another success for Disney self parody. This time in both live action and animation.,"Newcomer Amy Adams as Giselle is really the star of this film. Disney has had success before with self parody: ""Aladdin"" (1992) and ""Hercules"" (1997), but never before with a live action film. The Disney self parody works most of the time, but what really carries the film along is Amy Adams' performance as Princess Giselle. Immediately, she is lively, charming, spunky, likable and very much a Disney style fairy tale heroine. That's the first thing I noticed about this film. In my opinion, Disney does not have a good track record of live action films, with the notable exception of ""Mary Poppins"" (1964). So, I'm pleased to see a better than usual live action film from Disney.I thought Disney's self parody idea, used here in a live action film, would be the star of the film, and bring out, as before, more lively and creative screen writing. In parts, it does, more or less throughout the film. With the return of Academy Award winning Disney composer Alan Menken, the songwriting for this film seems to have had a very good inspiration, I think, partly due to Disney's return to it's fairy tale story roots. The self parody is mostly ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" without the dwarfs at first and later uses ""Cinderella"" for more references.The story idea of self parody, which can be very insightfully funny when done right, works well for most of the film. Whenever it falters a little, there is always Amy Adams charming and sprightly acting performance to hold one's interest and keep one believing in the magic of Disney's fairy tale stories all over again, for a new generation.Received 3 Academy Award nominations for Best Original Song.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Release your inner Disney Princess!,"Oh, golly, it's almost embarrassing how much I liked this movie. I remember being tempted to see the movie upon seeing early trailers and posters, but I also realized it would probably bomb. But hey, I was going to see it anyway. Clearly I never entirely grew up. It's classic Disney cotton candy fluff, I still can't figure out why anyone would be attracted to a cynical jerk, there were obnoxious talking animals... and I think I just answered my own question. Isn't this the stuff that makes Disney so abhorrently great? I've already seen it twice, and the second time around was just as delightfully scrumptious as the first. And why not? ""Shrek"" originally captured our hearts with contemporary cynicism in a fairy tale world--and look how that angle turned out in the end with that disastrous #3. Maybe society is ready for happiness and joy and joyness and little singing woodland creatures once more.And boy, do we get it. In the happy-magical kingdom of Andalasia (which is most reminiscent of the worlds of fellow princesses Snow White and Sleeping Beauty) we have the fair forest maiden Giselle, an angelic creature with a heart of gold dreaming of the day when she would receive True Love's Kiss. Fortunately, convenient Disney Destiny thrusts her into the arms of the handsome and dashing Prince Edward... and the happy couple are engaged about ten seconds later. All seems well in Andalasia, until Giselle is thrust down a waterfall into a horrible, dark place where no one lives happily ever after. That's right. New York City.However, Giselle, now reality-incarnated as the sparkling Amy Adams, is not about to let a bad situation get the best of her. She sings and dances out her views on the world via a less-than-subtle reminder that life would indeed be better as a musical. Throw in a simple-but-tried-and-true plot and some enchanting stereotypes of characters and she has a dazzling film of which any Disney Princess would be proud.Frankly, a lot of the wonder has to do with the casting and characters. Amy Adams is to Giselle as Johnny Depp is to Captain Jack in absorbing a character. Timothy Spall does an excellent job as a bumbling lackey, and his character of Nathaniel really wormed his way into my heart. James Marsden happily becomes Prince Edward and has a blast playing a properly two-dimensional prince who, as you know, must survive on looks, bravery, and charm rather than brains--fortunately his heart is just as big as Giselle's. Even Idina Menzel makes the most of her character's lack of screen time. I felt Susan Serandon could have had a bit more fun with her evil queen role, but still, it's hard to completely ruin any evil queen role. Patrick Dempsey also kept his role as straight man a little too straight (I still can't figure out why the character of Robert was supposed to be so great) but it was still entertaining to see him trapped in a fairy tale freak show while his own daughter is happily joining the party.This lovable cast leads us through a sprightly and sweet story that took a deeper look at the typical fairy tale ending--without getting mind-numblingly philosophical on this, because hey, it's Disney. I for one appreciated the idea that blissful unapologetic romance and thought-out personality/values matching are both necessary a relationship to really work.The story was cute, fresh, and funny. I had fun counting the various Disney references (and I still think I missed some). I still laugh over the idea that the obligatory talking critter lost his power of speech upon coming to the real world and it was wonderful to see Jodi Benson as Robert's recetionist sassing around whilst score from ""The Little Mermaid"" played in the background.The last act wasn't quite at part with the rest of the movie: the twist of the princess as the hero has actually become its own cliché and I think they could have come up with something a little more creative. I also still can't figure out why Patick Dempsey's character was all that wonderful, but Beauty and the Beast fell in love and I'm the one that would happily ridden off into the sunset Prince Edward. But all in all, it was indeed a very enchanting movie and I hope the Academy looks Amy Adam's way when it comes for nominations.It's the best kind of fluffy goodness, complete with a romp of hilariously stereotypical characters and fairy tale clichés--all done right! I'm sure there are plenty of people out there that will condemn this movie for not embracing reality and pain, and I bet those are the type of people that don't let their kids read fairy tales.The seven-year-old girl in me was extremely pleased.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Probably a great film for girls under the age of 8!,"I'm really sorry to all those who really enjoyed this film. I went to see it with my boyfriend and a friend and I literally CRINGED the whole way through. I didn't make it to the end, I had to leave about twenty minutes before it finished as I just couldn't take any more of the sheer joy and happiness.I am not a discerning film critic and enjoy many films of many different genres, and that is only the second time I have left the cinema before a movie finished. I was expecting a chick flick with an evil twist (in Susan Sarandon), I was completely unprepared for the songs and ever smiling and wondrous Amy Adams.Despite there being a good cast (unfortunately I was not won over by Amy Adams though), I thought the movie lacked any kind of storyline. Yes, she is a cartoon character who has been banished to the real world and is trying to find her prince, will she, won't she?

Enchanted,"Amy Adams is really quite entertaining in this latter day take on the ""Snow White"" fable. Falling pray to the envious Queen ""Narissa"" (a few fleeting appearances from Susan Sarandon) who wants her power, as well as her beauty, ""Giselle"" finds herself crawling out of a manhole cover and arriving in modern day New York City. Dressed as for a children's fairy tale party, she quickly finds herself a new friend in the form of ""Robert"" (Patrick Dempsey) and his young daughter ""Morgan"" (Rachel Covey). Initially he thinks she is not quite the full shilling, but the arrival of her pursuing beau Prince ""Edward"" (James Marsden) and his wily butler ""Nathaniel"" (Timothy Spall) soon sets him straight - and makes him realise that he - egged on by his daughter - is falling for this young woman. Who will win her heart? Can they get back to their home land of ""Adalasia""? I could have been doing with a little more animation mixed into this, but as it is, it is a quickly paced and enjoyable family drama with a decent degree of chemistry between Adams and the admittedly rather wooden, but easy on the eye, Dempsey. Marsden is probably the star for me, he manages to carry the character of chivalrous dope quite amusingly at times, and Spall always did manage these ever so humble, slightly obsequious, parts well too. Idina Menzel is here, yes, but no real chance for her to belt out any power ballads - indeed, the triple Oscar-nominated soundtrack is not one of Alan Menken's more memorable, I thought. Maybe a little too long, but it's still quite a creative interpretation of the original story, and is an easy to watch feel-good film.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Excellent Film,"I just saw this film last night and absolutely loved it. Much as the plot would suggest, it's everything you would expect of a Disney fairy tale come to life, with a bit of a modern twist. Amy Adams had the difficult job of portraying a character that could have easily been very two dimensional and clichéd, but she was fantastic, making Giselle a character the audience could sympathize with and root for. The film really has something in it for everyone. The women, men, children, and teenagers in the audience I saw it with all seemed to truly enjoy it. It is an excellent romantic comedy, but also wonderful family entertainment. While it does have moments of humor and subtext meant for the adults to appreciate, this is a film you don't have to be afraid to take your children to see. It contains positive messages for both the young and old - even hints of female empowerment that are so lacking in many of the classic fairy tales.

fairy tale meets real life,"This movie has - what else would you expect - a happy ending. The movie rides on the comical clash of cultures when fairy tale characters end up in New York city. The New Yorkers and the fairy tale characters clearly have very different notions on romance. In the end, they learn from each other. The movie was actually better than I had expected. Amy Adams is wonderful as Giselle. The ""prince charming"" was a bit cheesy and never evolved beyond the clichés. Susan Sarandon is pleasantly evil. Of course anything can happen in a fairy tale, so with the help of a kiss from the right prince and a glass shoe, the day is saved before the clock strikes midnight.

This and the beat-up genre are the foundation of the industry, and the product has to keep flowing.But at the same time, the audience is not only becoming more and more hardened, they like to see this represented in their film product which is the one place in their lives where most do sophisticated abstract reasoning. What do you do? Well, if you are the world's most mature studio in terms of narrative engineering, you'll try something like this.Its a romance movie that first tells you what the formula is, shows it to be a cartoon of life. Then it layers ""real life""  what I call folding  on it. There's a character that is told by our fantasy girl about movie love and expresses shock that such love is expressed ""without irony."" The idea is that somehow this fantasy world of movie love penetrates into our real world of rude New Yorkers and bad marriages. The roughness of the real world isn't all that rough though, and our visitor from a pure land does in the end change those around her. There's a child involved but her agency in the business is downplayed; she's less important than the curtains.So the formula is to first make fun of the formula by putting it in the first movie, the one within, and then let it seep into the outer movie, the one we are presumed to inhabit. At the end, we more consciously buy into the notion of movie romance.It didn't work so well for me because the ""real"" world was presented in an inadequately real way. There were construction workers, a rough bus driver, a homeless thief, rude passersby. But none of them had enough edge to count as real. The real world, in fact, was nearly as pretend as the cartoon world. So this breaks Ted's law which states that in order for these nested constructions to work, the distance between us and the outer world has to be the same as that between the outer world and the inner one, here, Andelasia.In keeping with best character engineering tradition, the girl here is redheaded. There's only one funny bit, a pantomime chipmunk.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",,Anonymous,Animation

Let me explain...,"It was bound to come one day: a movie about a princess from fairy tale land who comes to the real world. And where can one get a better taste of reality than New York? As I understand it, some people found it a little inappropriate to show Giselle (Amy Adams) wearing only a towel in that one scene. Obviously these people didn't realize that ""Enchanted"" is partly a parody of these sorts of movies (and confidentially, if I'd seen her like that, I might have asked her if I could get slinky with her). Of course, a gorgeous babe like Giselle probably wouldn't have wanted to get sexually involved with a dork like Robert (Patrick Dempsey).I should also say that Susan Sarandon, as evil Queen Narissa, also exudes eroticism. It takes one svelte gal to look that sexy while being totally wicked. In my opinion, Prince Edward (James Marsden) was best while watching TV, while Nathaniel (Timothy Spall) probably could be the star of his own movie.And the songs? They probably won't stick in my mind (sorry, I'm just not a fan of that stuff). Whereas the official description of Giselle is no doubt supposed to be ""beautiful"", I prefer to say ""hot""; seriously, what guy isn't gonna feel just a little aroused at the sight of her? The overall gist of the movie seems to be that if we were nicer to each other, then the world would be a better place (well, after everything that's happened in the world during the past few years, that's going to be a tough task).Anyway, it's not a bad movie. Not my favorite, but worth seeing as long as we understand what it portrays.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not a mere fairytale.,"Upon seeing the trailer of the movie, i thought of it as some sort of kiddie fairytale. yet, when I saw this on DVD,I was astonished. It may be a plain fairytale but critically, one can get a lot of learnings. plus, the soundtrack is also nice.Enchanted shares to its viewers that ""happily ever after"" does not happen in fairy tales only but it is also possible in real life. This is what's interesting about this movie. Its simple to understand but with much deeper implications.Excites the kid in us, at the same time, stir the positive side of reality. This movie will enchant both the young and the old alike.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Kind of disenchanting...,"Kind of disenchanting...I heard great reviews about ""the great Disney comeback"" but only the chipmunk sidekick Pip really delivered the laughs.Enchanted starts as an animated flick, and the audience is on board for how it would transition to reality. However, the cheesy cartoon, which is obviously meant to be a spoof, just dragged on too long for comfort.Amy Adams is a terrific actress and immersed in the character Giselle, but she looked way too old (at 33!) for the role. The grand transformation scene was anticlimactic; she looked dull and her lackluster, understated purple dress made her look washed out. Her plain but mercifully expressive face simply isn't beautiful enough, but her acting carried her all the way through.Patrick Dempsey is perfect as the tired, cynical lawyer Robert Philip, and so is Rachel Covey, who plays his shy child Morgan., who is forced to mature too soon. Covey is thankfully not annoying for a child actor and actually brought dimension to her character. James Marsden was great as the conceited, swashbuckling Prince Edward, while Susan Sarandon indeed looked evil as the villainous Queen Narissa.It's targeted more for children and is not as funny as Shrek or even Over the Hedge. If you hate singing in movies, not even when spoofed, you also might not take to Enchanted very kindly.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Believe the positive comments!,"I don't watch much television, so I went to this movie knowing very little about it - only that a Disney heroine is suddenly ripped into the real world. I made assumptions. I expected to laugh while the real world defeated all the foolish sensibilities of a fairy-tale princess. ...you know, the usual. The ""reality"" stuff. I feel a little guilty and ashamed now.The cast is fantastic; they chose charming and brilliant actors (or actresses) to fill each respective role - from the real-world every-man (Dempsey), to the bumbling mook (we love Spall; he knows how to work his 'look' and totally own a role). What really stands out, however, is Amy Adams's 'Gizelle'. The actress completely nailed it. I found it actually kind of amazing that she was able to bring the MOVEMENT of an animated Disney heroine to live action - with all the swaning, flouncing, and over-done hand gestures. Watching an actress attempt this could have been too embarrassing to watch, but she managed it while looking completely unintentional - and it really, really worked.The story itself is typical, and virtually every element is formulaic - but the ""magic"" is in how it's presented. This is Disney at it's best, reworking all the tried & true methods to create something new and fresh, without the risk of disappointment. You get drawn in, you care about the outcome - and you get your money's worth.Wonderful movie. Go see it!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Slight but quite amusing,"Not a great movie, but a delightful one. It's nice to see Disney playing with their own formula, even if it is with kids' gloves. So many other films and TV series have ripped it apart quite meanly, but few have done it as well and as poignantly. Enchanted still wants to rely in the happily-ever-after thing in the end, but at least they acknowledge the real world here. The lead actor plays a divorce attorney, for instance. He's a single father, and for the longest time I was expecting the story of how he became a widower, but then it's revealed that his wife left him. And it's nice to see the traditional princess and damsel in distress, played by Amy Adams, become the hero during the climax. Adams is the main reason to watch. She's such a charmer. James Marsden is also quite funny as the prince who has come to rescue her, and Timothy Spall has a nice, hammy role similar to the one he also played in Sweeney Todd last year. And it's nice to see Susan Sarandon turn into a dragon. It's about time she revealed her true form to the world.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Great Music, Average Film","Honestly, the rating of 7.8 on 10 was very very generous.The one thing I gotta give the movie was that the music was exceptional. The songs were very appropriately located and the artists did a great job with the soundtrack. Quite disappointed that none of the songs nominated came away with an Oscar - what with 3 nominations.The acting was average, script predictable, guess pretty much what u'd expect from a Walt Disney film...feel good, etc.Amy Adams put in an excellent Julie Andrewsish performance. Patrick Dempsey was his normal semi-happy semi-scornful self. James Marsden was awful, Susan Sarandon was wasted in the role. The chipmunk was funny - surprised they didn't throw him into a chipmunk - yeah yeah - song.All in all a good movie to take your kids to, but considering I don't have any, wouldn't really recommend it to most young adults.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
An Enjoyable Letdown,"Before I go into detail let me make a disclaimer: I was expecting a LOT out of this movie--I was expecting this to be the great Disney comeback.Now, that said, you could imagine my disappointment when it wasn't the perfect movie. I'd heard great things and I was expecting them. And in the first scenes I got them--Amy Adams is precious in this movie. She plays the part pretty much flawlessly and really puts forth a great performance. In fact, all of the scenes with just her (and many times with Patrick and the kid) are great. I found my self laughing and remembering all of the great Disney moments I haven't lived in so long.But the script really fell apart as they started transplanting more fairy tale characters into the real world. They stopped making light of old stereotypes from the classics and started applying new stereotypes from some of the worst examples of Disney animation. The script started to fall apart as they tried to work on comedy and get characters into scenes where they shouldn't be. And while it could have worked in the animated world--it doesn't in the real world and they lose the whole edge. Instead of just transplanting characters (many of which they didn't write very good parts for), they started transplanting typical gimmicks used in animated movies. They should have been making the characters funny: focusing on how they didn't fit in in New York, how things were no longer perfect. But once we got past Princess Giselle in New York City, all of the transplanted characters forgot they were in a different world that wasn't perfect (unless they were making a chincy cultural reference to bait the adult audience) and everything went exactly as it would have in the animated world. It wasn't really a great achievement in any technical areas either--it was pretty bland, typical family Disney movie.So the kids will definitely enjoy this, and if you don't care too much about acting, plot continuity, editing, cinematography, etc, you'll probably enjoy it for what it is. But if you are critical at all, if you couldn't sit through the latest remake of Cheaper By The Dozen, this movie is not for you. Do yourself a favor and just look up the Amy Adams scenes on Youtube (especially the Central Park scene, the apartment clean up scene, and the intro).Hears to hoping that Disney's magic will come back with the upcoming 2d animation flicks.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Enchanted is Everything and More ****,"This is a heartwarming tale.

He is ready to marry again to the lovely Idina Menzel.The merriment caused by the singing and dancing are wonderful. Everyone in the cast does so well.

Interesting self-parody,"What a concept - the idea of Amy Adams doing a Disney self-parody where a traditional fairytale character ends up in grimy New York.

No expectations before the movie - Came out very satisfied and happy,"I went on a free advanced screening of this movie.

Now, I'm not saying that Disney movies are bad, it's just that live action movies (or non-animated) usually, well... suckBut this one... as I watched it, magic went on, through my eyes and in my head. This movie is the reason why movies were created in the first place, to entertain. And with amazing music, I was impressed how catchy the tones were.Also, Amy Adams was completely amazing, I fell in love! She's definitely one of my favorite actresses now! Patrick Dempsey was great too and his daughter in the movie, one word = WOW! This is her second movie and she was fantastic! Can't forget James Marsden, he was great and his comedic timing is great too. And the animals were so adorable too. This movie is pure entertainment, I really recommend it.One of the best movies of the year AND probably the best ""fairy tale movie"" I've ever seen.I also want to cheer this movie because of its originality.

James Marsden is the next Jaleel White,"For something that looked entirely corny. this became somewhat of an absurdist view of the enchanted fairy tales. It is a ""what if"" scenario. What if fairy tale characters got to come to the real world and experience the ups and downs of real life? The answer isn't too far off in this film.Set in New York City, each character experiences life for the first time. Much like 3rd Rock from the Sun, the characters have a hard time making out what things do. So you get James Marsden arguing with the TV, Amy Adams using rats and roaches to clean an apartment, and Susan Surandon being Susan Surandon. And don't forget James Marsden stabbing that bus - thinking he is freeing some peasants.In the end, it becomes more normal like and loses its buzz. But its still nice. ""B""",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Sickly sweet. You'll love it or hate it,"I just want to say that this really isn't my sort of film. In my opinion Disney should be doing something more worthwhile with their time than making strange, sickly live-action films such as this. On the other hand, it is an original story done in such a way as to make it interesting. Amy Adams give a strong performance, and while the songs aren't Disney's best, they're still well performed. I did find it funny at times, and Timothy Spall has to be one of the best things in it. Conversely, I can't stand Patrick Dempsey. It's the sort of film that girls would love, and I can see why, though most other people would probably find that the minutes drag on.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Clever Throwback to Disney's Better Days Provides an Ebullient Breakthrough for Adams,"For those fortunate enough to have seen Amy Adams in Phil Morrison's ""Junebug"" (2005), you saw a genuinely guileless actress who is capable of conveying sincerity without a hint of irony. As the perennially sunny and interminably pregnant Ashley, she stole that picture easily, and the same holds true for this far more extravagant 2007 Disney production directed by Disney stalwart Kevin Lima (""102 Dalmations"", ""Tarzan""). This time, she provides the voice for Giselle, a fair maiden in bucolic woodland where the animals sing and dance as she dreams of kissing her prince. Fortunately, the handsome, self-absorbed Prince Edward shows up with his Marty Feldman-like sidekick Nathaniel in the nick of time as a gigantic troll is about to pounce on Giselle. They fall in love and decide to marry the next day.However, Edward's stepmother, the evil Queen Narissa, does not want Giselle in line for the throne, so she plots to be rid of Giselle by pushing her into a portal that ends up in the middle of Manhattan's Times Square. It's at this point that the film turns to live action, and Giselle is fully embodied by Adams as a wedding ball-gowned fish-out-of-water. Bill Kelly's amusing though somewhat erratic screenplay has her going through the predictable shenanigans, including a chance encounter with Robert, a pragmatic divorce lawyer and a single father to Morgan, an Abigail Breslin-look-alike moppet who wonders if Giselle could be really a fairy princess. Of course, complications ensue with not only Robert's suspicious fiancée Nancy but also Nathaniel, who has come after Giselle upon Narissa's orders. Edward also shows up, and consequently a romantic quadrangle develops with Giselle in an unfettered search for true love.Most of the musical numbers by Disney veteran Alan Menken and Broadway composer Steven Schwartz are catchy and true to the spirit of the story. ""Happy Working Song"", a vermin-infested paean to Snow White's ""Whistle While You Work"", and ""That's How You Know"", which mimics the calypso beat of The Little Mermaid's ""Under the Sea"", benefit from witty staging and Adams' surprisingly clear soprano. The only exception is the turgid love ballad near the end, ""So Close"", sung by Michael Bolton-wannabe Jon McLaughlin. Beyond Adams, James Marsden plays the hilariously misguided prince with gleeful panache, and Timothy Spall dances easily between malevolent and befuddled as the conflicted Nathaniel. Susan Sarandon is slumming as the Queen, but once she finally shows up in human form, she puts her authoritative spin and killer rack into the character. Perhaps because his character is scripted as such a downer, Patrick Dempsey makes for a lifeless romantic lead for the ebullient Adams. A couple of familiar Broadway performers show up  Idina Menzel (""Wicked"", ""Rent"") as Nancy, and Tonya Pinkins (""Caroline or Change"") as an embittered wife facing a nasty divorce.The one problem I had with the movie is the drastic shift in tone during the overdone, CGI-saturated finale. While I can appreciate the female empowerment orientation being conveyed, the story could have easily ended about ten minutes earlier. Fortunately, the hand-drawn animation in the opening sequence is a fine tribute to Disney's pre-Pixar glory. Given it is from Disney, the 2008 DVD has plenty of extras beginning with a behind-the-scenes featurette, ""Fantasy Comes to Life"". Divided into three parts, it shows how the production numbers for ""Happy Working Song"" and ""That's How You Know"" came together, as well as the finale. There are six deleted scenes, all introduced by Lima, which includes a storyboard-only alternative to the opening sequence. A two-minute blooper reel is included, as well as a five-minute short for the kiddies called ""Pip's Predicament: A Pop-up Adventure"" about the daredevil chipmunk and a music video of Carrie Underwood's ""Ever Ever After"". Definitely better than I expected.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A most notable modern tribute to the old classics.,"When two brothers decided to write a collection of simple children's tales they never thought that they would become so well-known and certainly never considered them to inspire hundreds of terrific other books, stage shows and of course films. Some of these have reverently mocked them, such as the timelessly entertaining 'Shrek' series (2001- .)'Brothers Grimm' (2002) exposed the gruesome gore hidden in these stories. But largely the most successful and perhaps the most exceptional of the lot are the marvellous array of award-winning animated classics from the legendary Walt Disney Company that initiated with the ground-breaking masterpiece 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' (1937.) And now in Christmas 2007  nearly seven years after their final cartoon release 'The Emperor's New Groove' (2001) they've decided to come back for more with a vastly more modern creation that isn't quite as pleasurable as the others but still a success.This is the charming story of another sweet, beautiful princess. Once upon a time in the faraway kingdom of Andalasia there lived a lovely young woman named Giselle (a splendid Amy Adams.) She lived in a small cottage deep in the woods with her many animal friends and every day dreamed of meeting her one true love. One day a dashing young prince named Edward (James Marsden) rode past the cottage singing a love song, Giselle rushed up to meet him and as soon as they each set eyes on one another they new that they were destined to be wed and so the wedding was instantly arranged. The word of this union soon spread throughout the land and everyone was overjoyed to hear the wonderful news, all except for Prince Edward's cruel stepmother Queen Narissa (a most wonderfully intimidating Susan Sarandon.) She knew that if her son married she would lose the crown and so banished poor Giselle to a feared place where no one ever lives happily ever after.So out she pops through a manhole into the busy streets of New York. Dazed and confused, she takes shelter in the home of a placid, sensible divorce lawyer named Robert (Patrick Dempsey) and his adorable little daughter Megan (Rachel Corvey) who have been at a great loss since the death of their wife and mother. Back in Andalasia Giselle's faithful friend Peppi the chipmunk (voiced by Kevin Lima and Jeff Bennett) has lead the prince through the portal and into the real world to save his true love. Now more furious than ever, the Queen sends her lovesick slave Nathaniel (a masterful Timothy Spall) to make sure that he does not find her. After he fails, she makes an incredibly dramatic and terrifying entrance into New York as well to take matters into her own hands.The film's main power source  apart from its vastly compelling cast  is the delightful entertainment in watching exaggerated, unrealistic fairytale concepts being put to the test in the world of reality. This film definitely shows that although their founder is long gone and they've changed immensely over the years they still have some of the unique quality that's made them what they are today left in them.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Sleeping Beauty Meets Snow White Meets Cinderella,"In this fish-out-of-water Disney comedy, a cartoon princess (Amy Adams) residing in a bucolic fantasy world is sent to modern-day New York by her evil future mother-in-law, played in delightfully wicked fashion by Susan Sarandon. The princess's fiancé, Prince Edward (James Marsden) leaps into our world to rescue her. Meanwile, the princess, now flesh and blood and thoroughly lost in Manhattan, is taken in by a starchy but compassionate divorce lawyer (Pat Dempsey) who is himself divorced with a small daughter. Pretty soon, the evil queen also hits the bricks in hot pursuit of the princess. You can guess the rest. The film begins with a gorgeously animated segment that perfectly imitates the angular style of Disney's 1956 SLEEPING BEAUTY. The live action segment, which takes up most of the rest of this expensive production, never quite achieves the excitement and humor of the cartoon, and viewers are likely to get restless long before the conclusion. There are some intentionally sappy songs and a big dance number in Central Park, and I have to say the special effects throughout were top notch. While Adams as the live-action princess is no raving beauty, she brings a huge amount of energy and a sense of fun to her slightly daffy character. Disney made a very smart move in hiring a competent actress rather than a simple looker for the lead role. Another nice touch: the legendary Julie Andrews narrates. I gave the movie a fairly high rating mainly for that opening animated sequence and Adams' wonderful, wide-eyed NF.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A  Surprisingly Effective Comic Fantasy for Grownups...,"The 2007 film ENCHANTED is a deft and imaginative musical/comedy/fantasy that breaks several cinematic rules in its execution of a richly entertaining story that intrigues and delights the viewer. The film opens as an animated fairy tale where we meet Giselle, a princess who, shortly before her marriage to Prince Edward, is magically transported to modern day Manhattan, thanks to Edward's mother, the requisite Evil Queen, where she is befriended by an attractive attorney and single dad. Giselle's fish out of water experiences in Manhattan blend seamlessly with the arrival of Prince Edward, the queen's henchmen, and the Evil Queen herself, who also arrive in New York to return Giselle to the kingdom of Andulasia. The story takes most of the turns it's expected to, but the journey there is the fun here, as the the old cinematic chestnut of the fish out of water, is dusted off and refashioned into a contemporary fantasy filled with child-like imagination and adult sensibility. Amy Adams is perfection as Giselle, the princess transported to modern times who believes that love is everything, animals clean house, and pigeons deliver flowers. Adams' wide eyed sincerity and clear as a bell singing voice help to make this performance the flawless marriage of actress and character. Patrick Dempsey and James Marsden are attractive as the single dad who Giselle falls for and her fairy tale prince who want her back. Timothy Spall provides some funny moments as the Queen's henchman and there is a brief, but fabulous scenery-chewing turn by Susan Sarandon as the Evil Queen. Tony winner Idina Menzel (WICKED) also scores as Dempsey's girlfriend (BTW, note to continuity dept: during the course of the film, we see advertisements for WICKED and for RENT, two Broadway shows supposedly running at the same time, that both starred Menzel, but I digress). The film is energetically directed by Kevin Lima and the surprisingly clever song score is provided by Alan Mencken (THE LITTLE MERMAID) and Stephen Schwartz (PIPPIN; GODSPELL). Top it off with some top-notch visual effects and cinema's most durable sidekick, Pip the Chipmunk and you have all the ingredients for a first-rate adult fairy tale that provides some big laughs in addition to the expected warm-fuzzy feelings.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Disney's start of the meta-commentary on its own brand. Fun enough, but just fine","I'm so mystified by this movie. On a visual or story level, it's not really groundbreaking to any extent-if I didn't know the history it was born out of, I probably would've said ""aww, that was cute"", and just moved on with my life (much as I feel about most of Adam Sandler's filmography). While that is largely how I feel I about the movie Enchanted as a film on its own merits, I can't overlook how smart it is as an amalgam of homage to the films of Disney past-even some of the very shots feel reminiscent of what had been animated before in Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and Cinderella. That was definitely the strongest element of what we got in this product-the filmmakers knew exactly what they wanted to do with this film and they executed those parodies/homages truly quite well.Other strong elements were the cast-it seemed like everyone (Amy Adams, Patrick Dempsey, Susan Sarandon) brought their a-game to this movie and I especially have to mention Idina Menzel's horribly underutilized Nancy-glad Disney learned their lesson and cast her in a starring role in the Frozen franchise. On its own, though, the movie was just fine-nothing bad to say, nothing great to say. I had fun enough, but I guess there was a reason I'd never revisited it before tonight after it came out 14 years ago.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Possibility of Happily Ever After,"While scarfing down some mushroom chicken and having a conversation with 3 and half year-old Jack and his dad Vince before seeing Disney's ""Enchanted"", excited Jack told me that ""Enchanted"" has a princess, a prince, and an evil stepmother that transforms into a dragon. Well, before finishing lunch I was thoroughly enrolled in ""Enchanted"". ""Enchanted"" is all about the possibility of happily ever after. Director Kevin Lima and Writer Bill Kelly tell an enchanting fairy tale that still resonates in this often time cynical world. Why not the possibility of happily ever after? Amy Adams emerges as a bright star in the role of Giselle, the fairy tale princess trapped in the real world of Manhattan, New York. Lima and Kelly seamlessly transition from the animated fairy tale world to New York City with measured disbelief. But then again, we kind of know what we are getting into when seeing this movie. ""Enchanted"" is a musical albeit tongue-in-cheek at times. The songs and music by Alan Menkin (""Beauty and the Beast"") and Stephen Schwartz (""Wicked"") are exquisite and classic homage to Disney films past. There is the spectacular musical number in Central Park with Adams singing as Giselle. She asks divorce attorney Robert (Patrick Dempsey), how does he know that he loves his fiancée Nancy (Idina Menzel), then bursts out into song.What really entranced me was the simple story. When Giselle asks Robert about true love, he argues, ""It's complicated"" There is a surprisingly touching scene in the park when Giselle tells Robert, ""I wish you find every happiness in the world."" Amy Adams is wonderfully earnest and genuine as Giselle. ""Enchanted"" is both a hysterical twist and homage to the fairy tale. Although at times blatantly cheesy, ""Enchanted"" is all about wonder and heart. Patrick Dempsey is great. He brilliantly plays the straight man in this collapsing of real and fairy tale worlds. He and Adams have amazing chemistry which is the foundation of ""Enchanted"".""Enchanted"" begins in the fairy tale world of Andalasia where Giselle awaits her true love. Until then she spends most of her days singing with the animals of the forest. Her true love would be Prince Edward (hysterically pompous James Marsden), who spends most of his days conquering the ogres of the land. This is the diabolically constructed strategy of Edward's wicked stepmother Queen Narissa (evilly camp Susan Sarandon) to keep him from marrying Giselle; thus, replacing herself from the royal throne. However, Giselle and Edward are fated to marry. On their wedding day Narissa, disguised as an old woman, banishes Giselle to the world of ""no happily ever after""New York City. Fortunately Edward's loyal chipmunk Pip clues in the Prince of this conspiracy. Edward then follows his beloved Giselle.Patrick Dempsey plays Robert, a single father and divorce attorney. Robert is at somewhat of a cross roads in his life. Though apparently good at what he does, he is unfulfilled. He is raising his daughter Morgan (cute Rachel Covey) by himself, and about to marry his fiancée Nancy (hilariously uptight Idina Menzel). And we all know that she is not the one. As fate would have it Robert and Morgan take in Giselle, who occurs as total nut job. Being more perceptive of these sort of things Morgan tells her Dad, ""I think she is a real princess."" Robert soon wonders whether he is going insane or that Giselle is really who she says. All the while, Robert wonders if he has found his true love in Giselle. Meanwhile, Queen Narissa journeys to New York with a poison apple for Giselle.It's good versus evil with a surprising heroic twist. The other surprise in ""Enchanted"" is the innate good in its characters. Well, except for Sarandon's Queen. However, Sarandon brilliantly balances the menace and camp for hysterical effect. James Marsden infuses a playful compassion in Edward. Patrick Dempsey embodies Robert's nobility. Amy Adams's bright spirit also radiates courage and character as Giselle. ""Enchanted"" celebrates the possibility of happily ever after in a very entertaining and special movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"light-hearted, slightly more adult disney","Opening scene narrated by julie andrews! Who doesn't love julie andrews?? Amy adams is giselle, who starts out as an animated princess. She is pushed down a well by a witch, and suddenly appears in new york city. Where people are very real. And now, so is she. And she meets up with robert, who's engaged to be married. Some raw humor as she cleans the bathroom. Rated pg, so it can't get too dirty. And when robert's girlfriend shows up, he better come up with an explanation fast! The evil queen voiced by susan sarandon. Fun scene where the prince stays overnight in a dumpy little hotel in nyc. It's all fun and light-hearted. Which relationship will robert choose? Rodent rage. Fart jokes. Funny. Directed by kevin lima, for disney. Written by bill kelly. It's good! The three oscar nominations were all for the original songs.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"I was surprisingly ""enchanted"" by this movie, it was actually very good.","I was forced to watch this movie by my girlfriend who is really into chick flicks unlike me, who is mainly into crime dramas and action movies, however, I ended up thanking her for it. At first I was opposed to this movie because I figured it was another lame attempt by Disney to ruin its classics that were unparallel in uniqueness and greatness to other children's movies, by making sequels, and making cheesy, corny romance films. However, my assumption was pleasantly proved wrong when watching this movie. This movie is actually pretty sweet and heartfelt. It isn't the typical cheesy romance you would expect walking into the theater. It is actually a very good and pleasant movie.The music is very appealing and euphonious. The lyrics are very good as well. It is the fact that nothing was done over the top that stopped the movie from killing itself. Demsey, playing an uptight single father, does a good job of being real and not going over the edge and turning the movie into a sappy pathetic disaster. Meanwhile, Adams, does the best job with her character. She's a great symbol of happiness and love and is perfect with every word and facial expression throughout the movie. She adds a great deal of humor to the movie by acting very nonchalant while embracing her childlike and innocent role.In short, for someone who would put this movie as your bottom 100 movie to watch, i put it on my top 10. It was a really good movie and would be time well spent when watching just to get some enjoyment and childish emotion while watching a movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
I think I liked it as much as my eight year old daughter,"I am trying to think of a family film that I enjoyed more than this. There isn't one. It was that good. Disney has a huge hit on their hands. Acting was great all around. It was Amy Adams' film though and her portrayal of Giselle was wonderful. I hated her in ""Junebug"" and she got an Oscar nod for that. Of course I thought that whole film stank, but she has done great work since. This is going to be the role that brings her to A list status and make her a household name. I can't imagine someone not liking Enchanted. Well actually I can, but I feel sorry for them, cause they would have to be a troubled soul. James Marsden gets some of the best lines as a totally narcissistic Prince.I have always liked Patrick Dempsey and he does great work as a straight man to Amy Adams princess shtick.

A spin on the classic fairytales,"Just have to start out by saying, Pip is the best character in this film. Funny, courageous, sassy, this chipmunk has it all.As for the rest of the movie, they have a pretty solid cast. All of the actors have played major roles in other films and they do a great job here.It's fun that this movie touches on multiple fairytale stories and plays into a few of them. I find that very creative.I think it's awesome that this movie takes place in NYC with human actors but also in the fairytale land where it's all cartoon animation.I wouldn't run to watch this movie again but if I found it while scrolling through the channels I would watch at least for a few minutes.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Incredibly Great Film!,"Yes, I totally agree. I didn't expect it to be this good, but afterward I realized I haven't been so easily moved by a film in a long, long time. The acting was exceptional, the story priceless, and the effects superb. When a movie makes it so easy to suspend my disbelief I can't help but enjoy it. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! We too were singing and dancing all the way to the mall (for Christmas shopping). ;) I am a film major with emphasis on screen writing, but I'm studying all aspects of film-making. This movie is hitting on all cylinders, so to speak. I kept thinking back to when I first watched Titanic and how moving and believable it was, but to capture that feeling in the ""fairy tale"" genre, really seems to be an impossible feat. This movie made the girls (4 and 8) and the adults (mid forties) laugh out loud, almost cry, and smile a ton throughout.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Disney's back, and they hit the mark!","I remember the days of Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, and Little Mermaid. Some of you out there might actually be able to remember the days of Peter Pan, but I'm afraid I can only go back as far as the early '90s...Enchanted is a very goofy, playful movie full of Disney jokes that poke fun at themselves. The reason I didn't give this movie more than 7 (a ""good"" rating in my opinion) is because it definitely didn't have the same feel as their older classics, but I really appreciated how Disney took a risk at making fun of itself for the sake of producing a truly entertaining and enjoyable film.The acting was overall very well done with the whole cast. Amy Adams pulled off a blank, dreamy-eyed princess near perfectly; James Marsden played a similar prince very well and I was particularly impressed after having seen him as Cyclops for so long. Timothy Spall has definitely stood out to me lately in movies and I was very pleased to watch him on screen.The plot, although generally typical for a Disney movie, took me by surprise. I knew it wouldn't be terribly ""deep"" per se, but I was shocked by how intricate they were with the story. Also, the theme was quite refreshing. The whole movie gave kids (and adults alike) a good idea of how to live properly IN the reality that we all occupy, but live FOR the dreams that are in our hearts.There were a couple of complaints I had; although the music was quite enjoyable I was expecting some more musical numbers and a little more variety, and I kind of hoped for a movie with a little bit less ""modern movie appeal"" attached to it.Overall, this movie was charming. It paid homage to classic Disney movies and it sort of revived something that we've begun to lose...a fun time at the movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Leaves you feeling giddily romantic,"What fabulous fun 'Enchanted' is! A welcome return to form for Disney. Amy Adams is blissfully sweet, yet slyly self-aware as the cartoon character caught in the real world. She and Patrick Dempsey make a sweet couple. The comedy routines and songs are the stuff of legend, specially a great Broadway musical in a park. A CGI chipmunk steals the show. Susan Sarandon is a trifle miscast as the evil queen and seems slightly out of place. The climax is a partial letdown. The first ten minutes comprise a clever Disney self-parody as they poke fun at their older romantic cartoons. A charming surprise indeed.Overall 8/10",,Anonymous,Animation

Disney Old School,"Enchanted is how Disney used to make live action films. There is enough whimsy and fun in the film to keep the kids involved, but there is also the elements that keep the parents in the seats with their kids. This really could have been a mess given the wrong leads. Amy Adams delivers a fantastic performance, she will be working in many films to come. Her performance is the cornerstone of the film. James Marsden once again shows a penchant for comedy (anyone checking out the ""making of"" docs on any movie he has done has seen his wit in action). McDreamy steps back into the big screen with success. Susan Sarandon and Timothy Spall are pitch perfect on the villain side of the house. Back on Adams, she is an absolute pleasure to watch, doe-eyed and all. The musical number in the park is worth the price of admission alone. It hearkened back to the heyday of when Disney did live-action musical comedies in grand style. They now have a new entry to go a long side the classics.Movies are all about the story and the actors you have to pull off the story. Disney hit a home run here with a self-parodying effort that could have failed, but with an excellent cast, the film rises to the top of Disney live-action comedies.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
ENCHANTED Personal Rating,"I thought ENCHANTED was perfect!!! It was excellent in all aspects...taking you from the animated world to reality and back...wow!!! It touches Comedy, Musical, Sentiment, Romance, Confusion, and many other senses, and very tastefully done. Disney is always tops when it comes to entertaining whether it be movies or amusement parks...they're always one step ahead of the rest, and always put the FAMILY in consideration where they can please all ages and genders. I didn't think my husband would be as excited to see the movie, he just went along with me, but when it was over, after everyone in the theater gave a standing ovation to the movie, my husband said he enjoyed it so much, he's looking forward to seeing it again and we definitely will buy the DVD when it's available. You must understand, my husband is a real He-Man and enjoys watching Football, Blood & Guts Movies, and All Action Packed movies, for him to watch a Fairy Tale Movie and ENJOY it, just amazes me...that goes to show you how good this movie is to please all!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Strange Fantasy,"I watch movies to escape the real world. This movie is silly, but lets you forget the real world for a little while. It starts off as a saccharine sweet cartoon, then morphs into a live action animation musical comedy-drama. A genre only Disney/Pixar can manage to create.Because of an evil scheme by a Disney stepmother (who else?), Amy Adams as Princess Giselle gets stuck in the company of mean New Yorkers, save a kind-hearted divorce lawyer (Patrick Dempsey - the former teen star that got better looking as he got older). Giselle speaks likes the cartoon character even in modern day New York, and New Yorkers believe she's just another crazy woman from the street. Both Disney Prince and Princess end up in New York, looking for each other while maintaining their cartoonish attributes. I know it's Disney and aimed at kids and family, but that was a little too unbelievable.The minute Adams' Giselle, became an angry New Yorker, because of Robert's (Dempsey) pessimistic view of love and life as a divorce lawyer, the story became more interesting and more watchable. I guess I can't relate to cartoon characters as much. Still the fun part was not watching the special effects, it was great seeing Susan Sarandon as the evil stepmother, Narissa. That's acting and she should have had a larger role in the movie. Not the best Disney movie, that belongs to Beauty & the Beast (IMO), but a fairly good escapism film, that got better as it neared the end.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Lovely clever movie with a great Amy Adams,"The movie's heroine, is Gisella, a Cinderella-like girl who lives in an enchanted land filled with talking animals and princes ready to save a damsel in distress.Just before her wedding to her prince, Giselle is pushed to a place ""without happy endings"" by the evil stepmother. Enter an amazingly good Amy Adams as Giselle, ready to face filthy New York with optimism. Other characters follow her from the animated world to the ""real' one and they are all equally amusing.Thanks to James Marsden acting chops, Prince Edward is strangely endearing, with his vacuous smile and silly bravery. Pip the chipmunk is adorable and the baddies of the story are suitable despicable.While Dempsey is suitable as the alternative love interest, Adams is really the heart and should of the movie. The way she moves her hands is impeccably artificial and strangely natural (for an animated character). Everything is perfect in her performance, right down to her arriving to the Kings and Queens ball in modern clothes.This is definitely a feel-good, heartwarming movie with a clever plot brilliantly executed.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney parodies itself,"Starting in classic Disney land a Princess finds her prince. Then falls into the dark world of New York city, where everyone lives unhappily ever after. Makes fun of itself by contrasting with the generic princess character. What it actually is, is a kids rom-com musical. The rom-com elements are great lots of laughs good songs all around the theme of ever after. The problem is the scenes for the kids with the animal character interrupting the flow of the other storyline. Timothy Spall is great as the side kick. It just gets caught between the adult and kids themes. Would have been much better as a straight rom-com.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very entertaining Disney film,"Disney's Enchanted (2007) is a very entertaining well thought out movie for all ages. Amy Adams is a perfect pick to play the lead here, she's bubbly, endlessly cheerful, and fits the princess perfectly. Patrick Dempsey is great in his role as well, he plays the widowed successful divorce attorney father raising a young daughter. He is very distant and detached in the beginning of the movie but as the film progresses and as he falls for Amy Adams, he starts to break from that and become more warm and we get to learn a lot more about his character. The character depth in the movie is very well executed and is more satisfying than most run of the mill family oriented films. And then we get to Susan Sarandon as the evil queen, which in my opinion was the best casting decision in the whole movie. She is so effortlessly evil and deliciously wicked. The visual effects are masterful and very cool to see, it's obvious that a large amount of effort was given to special effects, which is a very necessary thing for a film like this. You get an overall good feeling while viewing this movie, and the well written good hearted characters and great actors to play them are largely due to that. The movie incorporates different classic Disney animated films in the monumental ending. Such as leaving behind a glass slipper (Cinderella), a fire breathing dragon (sleeping beauty), and others, which was neat. I suggest this film as good well done entertainment. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Amy Adams will enchant your heart.,"I've had little expectations about the film ""Enchanted"" since I'm not one to follow the Disney princesses from Jasmine of Aladdin, Ariel of the Little Mermaid or Belle from Beauty and the Beast. But when I bought the film on DVD after hearing numerous people saying how wonderful it was prior to being a box office hit, I just knew this was going to be a delight.The film starts in animation form where the animals and trees sing while Princess Giselle waits for true love from Prince Edward before meeting with his mother (the wicked queen) where she kicks her into a well that takes her into another part of the world.The other world is none other than New York City, the city that never sleeps, where Giselle (Amy Adams in human form) is wandering in the streets all alone dressed in a white wedding gown and is not used to the mean and dangerous world compared to the sweet enchanted life. She confuses a short man for a dwarf while a homeless man steals her tiara leaving the princess all alone. It isn't until she's spotted by lawyer Robert Philips (Patrick Dempsey) and his daughter Morgan (Rachel Covey) where they have no idea what she's doing on a billboard. Morgan considers her a princess while Robert thinks that she's just lost and needs to go home.It isn't until the next day where things start to get a little strange for Robert where he starts seeing dancing cockroaches and birds while Giselle is singing her way in his home like a fairy tale.Meanwhile Prince Edward (James Marsden) is in human form where he takes his companion Pip, a talking chipmunk, and his faithful servant Nathaniel (Timothy Spall) to find Giselle just as The Wicked Queen, Narissa, played wickedly by Susan Surandon, wants Giselle dead and wants Nathaniel to finish the job.While this is a Disney film aimed mostly at 5 to 12 year old girls, as a grown male I was impressed to see that this film was enchanted with delight. But the real reason to see this film is none other than good girl Amy Adams who plays the character of Giselle so blithe and wonderful that not only will she be another princess in the Disney lineup, but she's someone that we wish we could have in the real world who only wants people to be happy.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Truly enchanting!,"Just saw Enchanted for the first time yesterday and found it adorable. Amy Adams as Giselle was so lovely, her smile, freshness, sincerity, innocence, all in her character was adorable. I love that animation was mixed with reality, something we don't see often nowadays. The eternal theme of love, happily ever after, is reviewed for the penultimate time, and it's cute. I only watched few movies with Amy Adams (the fighter, man of steel, leap year)and never realized how good an actress she is. So this is the story of Giselle, beautiful damsel about to marry the prince of her dreams when she is sent to another place in an attempt to prevent the royal wedding, by the evil step mother queen of the kingdom. Giselle finds herself in a strange place, meet strange people and learn new feelings. Little by little she will discover that life is not a fairy tale. Absolutely loved it!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Enchanted - indeed!,"Disney blends live action and animation for a tale that subverts all their own big fairytale hits of old for heart warming results. Basically it's a fish out of water tale as a princess (the heart achingly yummy Amy Adams) is thrust into modern day New York and proceeds to change the life of everyone she comes into contact with. While of course nefarious baddies have followed her from ""animation fairytale land"" to attempt assassination for crown grabbing purpose. The ending is a joy, as is the big theatrical musical number in Central Park. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A tribute to all things Disney,"Enchanted manages to be a lovely tribute to Disney films of the past while setting the bench mark for Disney films to come. For a Disney fan such as myself there are so many references to previous films for us to enjoy while watching the film.From great storytelling to great songs Enchanted is well deserving of the praise it received. It is an old fashioned family film that you don't see very often in this day and age of fancy 3D.Amy Adams is a fantastic actress and does this type of film so well as she has since shown in Night at the museum 2 and has all the charm, warmth and beauty to carry of the role of Giselle.This is by far one of Disney's best films of the last decade and is well worth searching out if you are a fan of Disney films or just a fan of good storytelling.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

I can't help just cackling WITH the excellent performance of Amy Adams.It moves me to tears each time in the best way.Maybe I watched too many cartoons as a child, but then again, I probably analyzed them, and the irony and satire present in this film is successful in joining those memories with reality.Quite delicious.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Real and animated collide,"I did like Enchanted (2007) and think it is a nice Disney movie to watch. It has a clever idea with the animated world and the real world coming together, this idea is what makes this movie interesting and fun to watch.Amy Adams as Giselle is enjoyable to watch along with Patrick Dempsey, James Marsden, and Idina Menzel. Giselle, played by Amy Adams, is a nice character to watch and you like seeing her walk around the real world mixing up a fairy tale life and a life in the real world.The 2D animation in the movie is good and looks pretty to look at, along with good voice acting from the actors. I like how the animated world has all the old fairy tale tropes, it was funny and worked well for the movie. Also having these fairy tale elements in the real world was funny.There are good songs, and the actors sing them well along with a good musical score that fits the Disney feel to it. The main plot of the movie is clever, and I like that Disney did a movie like this.Enchanted (2007) is an enjoyable and fun movie. I can see this being a fun family movie and people having a fun time, they just must prepare to see how much this movie can be like those old Disney fairy tale movies.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney! What is happening?,"Disney of late has come to a point that I don't quite get. They release a great film and then spend the next few years making mediocre films and direct to DVD sequels.Unfortunately this came under mediocre.I took my children (harsh critics if they get bored) and sat back ready for what I was hoping would be the top draw stuff that Disney is capable of. I didn't get it.While the premise is a clever one they have done the cross over between alternate worlds before, and done it better.The cast themselves were on the whole good, but the best, Sarandon just wasn't on screen enough. Spall added the comic relief and was value but the rest just seemed to be going through the motions. I know it is a children's film but they should still be trying to be believable.The best of Disney's recent releases have all come by way of Pixar. They seem to put the time and effort into their scripts and set pieces and they always deliver something that is aimed at children but has enough in to keep the adults entertained as well.That is where enchanted failed. I wasn't entertained and found myself all, too often trying to work out how long the film had left to go so I could go home.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Is that the only word you know? ""No?""","Imagine if the royal couple from a classic Disney animated fairytale adaptation traveled accidentally into modern day New York. This basically give us the company's own take on that exact concept and it's pretty clear that they were careful to not go so far that they alienate their fan base. It's playing it very safe and basically improving the brand without actually changing all of the aspects that led to the backlash that was in full swing around this time. Some of the jokes are the exact same as everyone was making in memes already. It even reinforces some of the regressive values and features some of its own.With that said, it's near impossible to not be won over by this. The idealistic view of romantic love that Giselle believes in with her entire being is genuinely infectious. It's no wonder that this led the world to embrace Amy Adams as a star. It wasn't the first time she played a well-meaning naive optimist. She nails that in Drop Dead Gorgeous as well; though here, she does walk an even finer line. Almost everyone around her is expressing jaded cynicism and yet she manages to not just be obnoxious. The same is true for her seeming polar opposite Robert who is the straight man to her shenanigans. A divorce lawyer and single father, of course his heart is not very open.This truly does deliver everything that was expected from the type of film that it is playing with the tropes of, and does actually function quite well as an entry not only a satire. That is one of the reasons it has been referred to by a number of people as Shrek without the bite, another excellent movie. This has absolutely amazing live action musical segments that actually reach the level of the original Blues Brothers in parts. Not quite at the same amount. Huge crowds of people dancing and singing you just wish you could step through the screen and join them. The costumes are stunning, props, creature design, depiction of magic. It's tense and exciting, funny, cute with marketable animal sidekicks. The CG doesn't push it too far with extremely few exceptions; it's not always photorealistic but it's meant to be somewhat stylized. It rarely feels like there's just nothing there. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Some ""enchanted evening"" is here for young and old romantics alike","Gisele (Amy Adams) lives in a little cottage in her animated world. Her only friends are the tiny woodland creatures who help her around the house. Yet Gisele insists that a handsome prince will come, as she sings about her ""true love's kiss"". Prince Edward does come soon after and they fall in love, fairy-tale style. The next day, as Gisele is coming to the castle in a wedding gown, ready for the ceremony, her soon-to-be mother-in-law, Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon) disguises herself as a hag and pushes Giselle down a ""wishing well"" to the land where ""there are never any happy endings"". That would be New York City, of course. (The Queen does this so she does not have to give up any regal power). Gisele comes up through a manhole and into heavy traffic and confusion. But, someone soon comes to her rescue, a handsome lawyer named Robert (Patrick Dempsey) and his little girl, Morgan. Robert is about to marry a no-nonsense lady named Nancy and he is utterly befuddled by Gisele, who breaks into song on a walk in the park and who does not even have a driver's license. Even so, he can't help but notice her beauty and her sunny nature. Can fairy tales happen, even in Manhattan? This is an enchanting, lovely movie from the talented Disney company. First, it has a nice combination of animation and real life that works seamlessly well. Secondly, it has some new, wonderful songs by Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz, including ""True Love's Kiss"", ""Happy Working Song"", and ""That's How You Know"", some of which should be nominated for Oscars. And, thirdly, the cast members are very well-chosen, too, with Adams making a beautiful, songbird princess, Dempsey showing he is a natural choice for a ""real world"" prince, and Susan Sarandon giving a great turn as the evil queen-stepmother. Naturally, the production is enchanting, too, with gorgeous costumes, scenery, and cinematography. Therefore, if you are seeking a nice, family film for the little princesses at your house or are one of the true romantic souls of the earth, do not delay another afternoon. Some ""enchanted evening"" is here this holiday season, just for you, at the nearest cinema multiplex.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Charming, funny and accessible","I found Enchanted to be a pleasant surprise. It appears to be a standard Disney offering, but the excellent cast, and clever, witty script, elevates this to a classy film which pastiches earlier classic Disneys without parodying them.The story opens nicely as a classic animated tale of our innocent, lovely heroine (Giselle, nicely portrayed by Amy Adams), is united with her Prince Charming (Edward, ably played and sung by James Marsden) and to me married on the next day. The formula is completed when Edward's step-mother (Queen Narissa) thwarts the union by disguising herself as an old crone who proceeds to push poor Giselle down a magical wishing well, to a place where there are 'no happy endings'.The realisation of the animation and live characters is very nicely down and plays on the conventions classic animated films - the two- dimensional true love and tidy, idyllic world of Andalasia and its bland, ballad-singing Prince Edward, compared with the cynical lawyer who reluctantly rescues Giselle shortly after her emergence from in New York sewer.There are some great cameos from Susan Sarandon and particularly Timothy Spall as the guilt-racked servant of the Prince secretly working for his beloved queen to feed Giselle a poisoned apple.""Sire, do you like yourself?"" asks Nathaniel, as the two of them discover the miracle of television.""What's not to like?"" smiles Edward charmingly.It's the interplay between the real-world cynicism of divorce lawyer Robert (Patrick Dempsey) and Giselle that really carries the day; the story is adult enough to amuse grown-ups but has enough silliness and fun to entertain older children.I found it great fun, and have watched it more than once!Roll on Enchanted 2.

SUCH A MAGICAL AND FEEL-GOOD EXPERIENCE,"One of the films that I can truly say bring out a genuinely feel-good vibe to me watching it. Amy Adams was one of the most versatile actresses of all time. This role she portrayed solidified her household-name status. The movie used a clever mix of live-action, computer-generated infographics and animation elements in such a way that was rarely seen during that time. It was magical and very fantastical. The costume design and make-up were also not overdone. Unfortunately, the story was so predictable. But don't blame it on its ""happy ever after"" notion. It was the story itself that lacked innovation. But overall it was such an amazing movie recommended for all ages.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Great idea, film doesn't quite live up to potential. Works for kids though.","The concept of taking Disney love into reality is always going to be an interesting approach. In hindsight, the romance of the Disney movies before the 1960s is simplified and flawed. Heck, even afterwards they have their problems. It hasn't been until this decade when the romance feels more up to date. It's not there yet but it's progress. There's a compelling exploration to be made there, that is, if Enchanted was willing to go a little darker, but even though I didn't expect it to, it doesn't hit all the notes. It's enjoyable though, deliberately sickly sweet, but it crumbles by its third act when Susan Sarandon turns up. Still, plenty of charm along the way, especially with the spirited cast with Amy Adams, James Marsden and Timothy Spall proving how perfectly cast they are. Very nice animation sequences as well, really ties it together. Doesn't live up to its potential but at least it's not annoying.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Huge Waste Of Time And Money.,"I can not believe all of the good reviews I keep seeing on this particular movie. Personally, I absolutely hated it. I went to the theater to see this movie with a really close friend, mostly because Patrick Dempsey, Mr. McDreamy himself, would be staring in it. However, that alone was not enough to keep me or my friend even remotely interested. I know that the movie is supposed to be targeted to a younger age group and people of ages seventeen and eighteen shouldn't even consider watching a Disney movie, we did. And we regret it.The plot alone was terribly unconvincing and there were too many plot holes to even start saying. The acting, with the exception of Mr. Dempsey, was just too horrible for words. And the special effects were just awful. All in all this movie was a seriously big disappointment to me. It literally shocks me that I am probably one of the few people on IMDb that found this particular movie horrible. It was a terrible waste of money, and an even bigger waste of time.So in conclusion, if you happen to get the urge to go out and buy this movie because of the pretty title, and the pretty guys, just do me a huge favor and don't. This was one of, if not the, biggest letdown after all of the hype about how great and perfect it was. Perhaps Disney should make a remake of this movie with better acting, better graphics, and a plot that isn't so predictable it's almost like you know what is going to happen from the second the theater goes dark.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

Loved the line and scene when she tells Giselle that if you can't find a fairy godmother, then the credit card is the next best thing.Also the little parts with the chipmunk are SO cute.

thin but enjoyable fantasy,"""Enchanted"" is a fish-out-of-water tale that is also an homage to ""Snow White,"" ""Sleeping Beauty,"" ""Mary Poppins,"" and countless other Disney classics that have come before it. Here, a fairy tale princess (Amy Adams) crosses over from the world of animation to the world of live-action, without losing her cheery disposition and otherworldly charm in the process.On the day she is to be wed to her long-awaited Prince Charming, the beautiful Giselle is tossed out of the storybook kingdom of Analasia by a jealous evil queen (Susan Sarandon) who has no intention of letting some pretty little upstart usurp her throne. When Giselle finally finishes falling, she lands smack dab in the middle of a live-action Manhattan that is only a tad less immaculate and a shade less colorful than the cel-animated world she calls home. The plucky heroine is both dazzled and a bit confused by this strange looking world where the people don't seem quite as friendly or optimistic about life as the inhabitants of Analasia. Giselle is befriended by an unromantic, decidedly commitment-phobic divorce attorney (Patrick Dempsey) who doesn't know quite what to make of this odd, undoubtedly deranged creature who, when she isn't inspiring critters to help her tidy up the apartment or breaking out into full-throated, spontaneous song, is extolling the virtues of true love and declaring her undying faith in happily-ever-after endings.Most of the fun of ""Enchanted"" lies in watching this almost impossibly cheerful, utterly imperturbable former cartoon character going up against the harsh realities of the real world (as harsh as the ""real world"" in any Disney film can be, that is), yet maintaining her sunny disposition throughout. The filmmakers have devised some spot-on parodies of the typical Disney musical number, replete with high-pitched warbling, a chorus of singing animals, and lyrics that reflect an unquenchable conviction that all is for the best in this best of all possible worlds. At times, the idea of the film is better than its execution, opting, as it often does, for silliness and strained slapstick over sophistication and wit. And sometimes, even the concept itself falls flat, as when we are left to ponder whether these creatures, with their weird behavior and exotic garb, would really be all that out of place in Times Square. And, regrettably, the filmmakers couldn't resist throwing an utterly superfluous, CGI-generated dragon into the mix at the end.Yet, for the most part, the movie is clever, bright and beguiling, and boasts a wonderfully ditzy performance by the lovely Miss Adams that brings the whole sugarcoated confection to life. The material many be stretched a bit beyond its breaking point, but ""Enchanted"" casts a spell over its audience anyway.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Kevin Lima knew we pass the values, ideals, purity and life lessons that are timeless and should always walk with us on our walk. It's light, fun and exciting at the same time","Enchanted proves a pleasant surprise from Disney and knows very well play with passages satirizing the company's own tales, but can do so that everyone laughed with the animation studio and not them. Here we see the beautiful princess Giselle (Amy Adams), who was recently banned by an evil queen from her magical, musical world. The princess has just been stopping in the city of Manhattan of today, a place completely different from where he lived. Soon she gets the help of Robert Philip (Patrick Dempsey), a lawyer who falls for divorced. Robert has a job that is precisely the antithesis of ""happily ever after"": he specializes in contentious divorces. Eainda He has a daughter, Philip Morgan (Rachel Covey), which also ends up liking increasingly princess. But Giselle is already betrothed to Prince Edward (James Marsden), who also decides to leave the magical world to find his beloved.Written by Bill Kelly, the Blast From the Past (1999) and Premonition (2007), the modern fairy tale brings the basics to productions such as animals that sing, a princess naive, apples enenenadas, a witch, booties crystals and even a dance. Allied with the direction of the grandson of Portuguese Kevin Lima, the plot has the great advantage of mixing the real world with fairy tales, and even mix effectively with conventional animation that established the Walt Disney Studios with filming real (live- action) that has been inserted into the troubled and conflicted world of the XXI century. When playing a princess and a prince innocent foolishly romantic in the XXI century, the purity and innocence of Disney world collide with the harsh reality of the real world. It is precisely this duality between the purity of fairy tales with the world today which is the great charm of this film. That's not to mention the mixture of real actors and their cartoon versions, ie, the reality with poetic license and exaggerations present in the cartoon. This difference is the ideal setting to ensure lots of laughter by emphasizing the way of thinking, acting and believing in things completely different worlds.The film begins with an animation made in 2D (not 3D-turned foot when it comes to animations), but not contracenam animated characters with real actors, just turning into people while being transported to Manhattan. Both in animation, and after arriving at the new location, what we see are several explicit homage to the great classics of animation, in addition to bringing several references animation studio, like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Cinderella.As every fairy tale, the movie is manipulative and predictable, but at no time did we feel cheated by it. We have very beautiful and exciting moments as all the musical scenes and the interesting scenarios and situations that arise in the plot. The dance at the end is also touching, until the expected final showdown with the evil queen.For everything to work well in a comedy and assumed that messes with fairy tales, it is essential to cast the values. Amy Adams plays a charming princess. His talent in the songs and the show ingenuity Giselle really make all the difference. It is the fundamental basis for the film works perfectly. The chemistry of the actress with Patrick Dempsey happens so naturally as seldom realized in film. Dempsey's fun playing a disillusioned and divorced lawyer, and Amy shows a Giselle, who while waiting to be saved by the beloved, and shows important values of life for him, auemntando progressively over the duo. James Marsden is also quite comfortable and amused as the handsome Prince Edward. The way brave, gallant and dress like a real prince in the middle of New York, is catchy and hilarious. Susan Sarandon also clearly having fun as the evil queen who intends to kill the princess Eloa not assume his throne. Timothy Spall as Nathaniel, is also great. Moreover, the film has the luxury of having Julie Andrews as the narrator of the tale.Kevin Lima knew we pass the values, ideals, purity and life lessons that are timeless and should always walk with us on our walks. It's a film rated free and done for the entire family. The cast is mingled and mixed the cartoon fairy tale with realistic interpretation of today perfectly. It light, fun and exciting at the same time, and still worries about spending good values to your audience.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A rare treat that comes along once in a lifetime,"Rarely do I go to the theater and see a movie as enjoyable and great as this one. Disney made ""Enchanted"" as an effort to recycle some of the classic formulas and poke fun at them at the same time. It tells the story of Princess Giselle (Amy Adams) falling down a well and landing in the real world, and while waiting for Prince Edward (James Marsden) to rescue her, she meets Robert (Patrick Dempsey) and his daughter and both ends up learning from them and touching their lives. Not only was it hilarious watching the characters try to adapt to these situations, but the film ended up being incredibly romantic and touching. ""Enchanted"" has quickly become my second favorite live action Disney film, next to ""The Parent Trap."" See this film, or you may miss out on a real treat.

Fair Tale,"Cartoon characters jump into a well and emerge from a sewer under a busy street in live action New York City. This Disney fare borrows from other Disney movies as well as a number of other fish-out-of-water stories but manages to be fairly entertaining. Adams is charming as the modern Cinderella who must cope with a world where everything does not go as smoothly as in a fairy tale. Dempsey is given little to do but look handsome and he does it well enough. Sarandon has a small role as the wicked stepmother but she vamps it up. The squirrel is cute as are all the other animals. It's all very predictable, but that's what endears it to the kids to whom it is targeted.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"'Enchanted' Amy, and the movie is a fairy tale come true!","My Take: A very familiar fish-out-of-water Disney musical, but with great tunes, loving touches and an appealing performance by Amy Adams.The Disney studios has done a long strain of mediocre to terminally bad works for such a time. Be it the banal THE WILD or the insufferable CHICKEN LITTLE, Disney might have hit rock bottom as far as the studio is concerned. But, after a long exhausting line of ""Oh, boy!"" efforts, I approached ENCHANTED with very low expectations. When I saw the posters for the film, I let out a small sigh of hopelessness that Disney will ever get out of its mediocre status. But when the film started to stir up a buzz, I was forced to get sucked into this immediately. The critics praised the film as ""sweet"" and ""refreshing"". The Tomatometer at Rotten Tomatoes.com ranked it with, not just a passable, but a high rating of 93%. Pretty high for a simple film like this, but I took the time to see this film on video after missing it on the big screen.The film opens with an animated sequence, which was just as awful as I'd expect. The animation sequence was lacking in anything I liked about Disney. By this point, I was about to give up. I was glad I didn't! After the tiresome animated opening, the movie evolves into a sweet, funny and often refreshing rom-com, in fact much more entertaining than most I've seen in years. It's also satisfies as the best Disney movie in a long time, and it's really been a long time, so it's worth seeing.Perhaps one of the main reasons why the movie makes a terrific return to form is the return of Academy Award-winning composer Alan Menken, who serves up a series of energetic and lovable musical numbers and lavish songs to come along with it. Other than that, the real star of the film is Amy Adams as the fish-out-of-water Princess Giselle. Fans might remember her from her Oscar-nominated performance from JUNEBUG, which earned the hearts of critics. Her performance here is another winner. In fact, she carries the entire movie right along her winsome and blissful performance as a clueless princess, kicked out from her candy-coated paradise and transported into the world without any happily ever afters, modern New York City. Patrick Dempsey plays the divorce lawyer who comes to her aid, much to the insistence of his princess-loving daughter (Rachel Covey). On the other hand, Giselle's true husband-to-be Prince Edward (A surprisingly joyous James Marsden) goes down the same well and arrives in New York in search of his beloved (in one scene, Edward points a sword to a construction worker and says ""I seek a beautiful girl!"". The worker replies ""I'd like to find one of them too!"") Supporting performances by Timothy Spall as Edward's right-hand man Nathaniel who apparently happens to work with an evil witch (a rarely-used Susan Sarandon), who also happens to be Edward's evil stepmother who wants to prevent her son to get married. Among the other pleasures of the film is the twists on their old fashioned fairy tales. Like, for example, Nathaniel tries to poison Giselle with three poisoned apples in many of outrageous ways (namely, caramel apples on a stick, apple martini). The good thing about the film is that it's so joyous and blissful that audiences are guaranteed to smile at the thing for it's entire running time. And if that's all I can ask in a movie like ENCHANTED (I guess it really is), then Disney delivers immensely.Rating: **** out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A great modern fairytale,"Even though I'd heard good things about this film I wasn't sure what to expect as I haven't watched an animated Disney film in decades, aren't that keen on romcoms and dislike it when film characters break out in song... in the face of it I should have hated this film but as it turned out I loved it! Starting in a saccharine sweet animated kingdom we are introduced to Giselle; a princess attended on by a variety of overly cute forest creatures; one day she is attacked by a troll but luckily she is saved by Prince Edward. This being a fairy tale they fall in love and are due to be married but Edward's wicked step mother pushes her into a magical fountain and she finds herself in New York City. As she wanders round looking for her prince Robert, a divorce lawyer, and his young daughter help her. Edward follows through the fountain to find his beloved.As I watched the opening scenes I was fairly sure I wasn't going to like the film but once the action moved to New York where everything became live action I really enjoyed it and laughed often even though I'm sure I'm not part of the target demographic. Amy Adams was an utter delight as Giselle; making the character a naïve innocent without being irritating. James Marsden hammed it up in an entertaining fashion and Timothy Spall was fun as his less than trustworthy sidekick. Also of note was Patrick Dempsey who played Robert; it can't have been easy playing the one normal main character amongst a group of fairytale characters. While this is a fairytale it is rather nice that for once the heroine wasn't just a damsel in distress; when there is danger Giselle is quick to get stuck in. This is a film that adults and children can enjoy equally and I heartily recommend it to both.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
The trailer was more fun than the movie itself!  Boring!,"We are real movie enthusiasts and own, amongst many others, almost all Classic Disney's (animated / pixars / and Normals). Since we both have a busy life I almost never take the time to write a review on IMDb. But this movie is So Disappointing, corny and clearly written for a fast buck ($$$), we have to warn the real Disney-lovers. Because of the fact hat the trailer contains some funny bits, we thought ""if the rest of the movie is like this, it must be a nice movie"". With that in mind we bought the DVD. But when we watched it, it became clear that the bits we'd seen in the trailer, were the only funny scene's in the whole movie! Furthermore the movie was not entertaining in any other way. It was a long sit waiting for something interesting or funny or 'enchanting' to happen without ever seeing any of that! Anyway since so many reviews are stunningly positive about this movie, giving a wrong impression to people who use IMDb as a guide for making a good buy, I felt obligated to warn you all! We are going to bring this DVD back to the store! We urge you, don't waist your money on this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
a delight,"Sweet, charming Disney fairy tale about a wide-eyed, warmhearted damsel (a radiant Adams) who's in line to marry the handsome prince. Unfortunately his wicked stepmother is fiercely reluctant to relinquish her crown, and banishes the poor girl to the 'real world' where there are no happy endings. Alone in modern-day Manhattan, she meets a cynical lawyer and single father, himself engaged, then brightens up his life and for the first time questions the very meaning and nature of love. It's not difficult to guess what happens next, but the film is a wonderful mix of creative animation and live-action, with great songs, in-jokes, an ideal cast, and an irresistibly joyful feel throughout. Adams shines—both literally and metaphorically—and Dempsey is a good fit for the leading man. ***",,Anonymous,Animation
Snow White Redux,"Snow White being one of my favourite films ever I felt I had to see this parody of it and themselves by Disney, nor was I disappointed. It's probably the best piece of non-violent non-heavy entertainment made in the last 10 years, updating Disney's roster of fairytale films with a bit of gentle mocking, respectful homage and a touch of worldly cynicism and getting away with it.In cartoonland a beautiful girl is transported out of the way to the real world by evil Queen desperate that her stepson Prince shouldn't have the chance to marry her and thus become King. However he and a chipmunk follow her to bring her back while a friendly young girl and her father Patrick Dempsey look after her  to my daughter he was the most enchanting thing about Enchanted! Chaos is brought to the streets of New York as well as smiles to the faces of all of the denizens of Central Park participating in a spectacular song. Does Love conquer Cynicism or does Love conquer Singing in the streets? There's some nice songs , some smooth dancing, clever referencing and witty dialogue along the way to savour. You know you're in the modern film world however when the cartoon chipmunk inadvertently dumps - once upon a time Disney's animators used to spare us such crudities. Be sure too that you know your Snow White, Cinderella, Little Mermaid, Sleeping Beauty, Beauty And The Beast et al - even King Kong - to get the most from this. The ending was a bit hurried  but just like Snow White's was!Ultimately it's a refreshingly entertaining little film and cheerfully indifferent as to whether it has any faults or not.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Great But With Some Weak Points,"2 December 2007. Unfortunately, this fun, entertaining, and delightful romantic, animated/live action movie has a problems that just can't be ignored and besmirches an otherwise solid film. The music, the plot, and fusion of live animated characters, the idealistic fantasy world values and the blending of the real world values are emotionally satisfying. Giselles first experience of the real world is a dizzying and brilliant sequence full of hurt, bewilderment, and the whole range of just what one would expect from fantasy meets New York. It is intriguing how the flat, old animated beginning sequence was necessary at this junction in such a film as this in order to heighten the contrast between the old fashioned animation film characters and live human characters. The animation technology has advanced sufficient to actually make this movie effectively successfully, something that wouldn't have been as rich and believable even a decade ago. The first problem occurs with the casting of Nancy, the protagonist's girlfriend, with actress Idina Menzel. Her physical appearance just doesn't lend itself to the overall movie's theme and character by the end of the movie. There wasn't sufficient character development if she was to be used, which wasn't really necessary, but she was cast almost too animated-like as a black and white idealistic character instead of the more complicated human character of New York City. A second problem with this movie was the over-exaggerated musical reality that occurred midway through the movie turning this movie for a brief time into a fantasy musical when in fact most of the movie is charming just for its more realistic bent meeting idealistic fantasy characters. This sequence while charming, didn't fit in this movie and took away some of the flow of the movie. Finally, reminiscent of THE GOLDEN CHILD (1986) starring Eddie Murphy, he gets to battle an evil character who seems to transform into a large, horrific character played Charles Dance. The major conflict sequence seems somewhat confused, less effective, particularly as to what happens to the Queen. Overall, this is a fun, family movie that is rich with family themes, the importance of romance but also the importance of achieving one's balance with reality. It's not one or the other.

Such a sweet movie,"Am I the only one who thinks Amy Adams should stick to playing sweet characters in the movies? She's so delightful, and she has a natural radiance that comes with her whole-hearted smile. She was the absolute perfect choice to play a real-life Disney princess, and I could easily see her working at Disneyland and taking photos with kiddies.The beginning cartoon sequence of Enchanted is too cute for words, and when each character gradually enters the real-people world, they have such a natural reaction to their new surroundings. Amy is so sweet, she can't imagine meanness in others; she famously thanks Patrick Demsey for sarcastically welcoming her to New York. When she finally learns about anger and wrong versus right, she gives wonderfully subtle transition emotions that make us believe she truly is a cartoon character come to life.One of the most charming aspects of this movie is the classic Disney formula that still remains. With the world so cynical and changed from the golden age of the 1950s, how is it possible for audiences to tap their toe to shmaltzy songs and believe in true love? But this cynical-to-sweet story manages to sweep a jaded divorce lawyer (Demsey) off his feet, as well as millions of audience viewers. No matter how ridiculous and unrealistic you may find Amy Adams at the start of the movie (I didn't think she was at all), you're guaranteed to fall in love with her and her sunny personality by the time she conducts a spontaneous musical number in Central Park.In the supporting cast, Susan Sarandon hams it up as the Evil Queen, but at least she's given a funny name: Narcissa. Julie Andrews narrates the opening scene, and in a funny casting choice, Idina Menzel, famous for playing the Wicked Witch on Broadway, plays Demsey's perfectly normal girlfriend. As Prince Charming and his valet (who secretly works for the evil queen), James Marsden and Timothy Spall have a great rapport together. Is there a better choice for a real life Prince Charming than James Marsden? He's just a doll, and it makes you wonder why Amy would ever look twice at someone else. But, as this movie proves, life is not a fairy tale, and happy endings aren't guaranteed. Although, ""true love's kiss"" certainly does have a magical quality about it - just ask anyone! In a hilarious and unrelated note, when I saw this movie in the theaters on Thanksgiving, it was a packed house, and during the kiss scene, a little kid let loose an ""Ewww!"" It was adorable, and I'll never forget it.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. When Amy first turns into a human, the camera spins upside down until she crawls out of the manhole cover, and that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
An enchanted and wonderful movie!,"This is an animated-meets-live action movie where Princess-To-Be Giselle (Amy Adams) is prepared to wed Prince Edward (James Marsden), to the dismay of his evil stepmother, Queen Narissa, because she will lose her throne. She banishes Giselle faraway to New York, where she ends up befriending a lawyer (Patrick Dempsey).This is a nostalgic movie that brings back memories of animated Disney classics. When these animated characters run into the real world, you are asked to let your imagination run wild as these animated characters turn into real life - a very clever touch and concept. What results is a well-paced story from start to finish as we follow along the magic, fun, adventures and music - from Giselle trying to adjust to her new surroundings in New York to Prince Edward searching for her in the city, with the Queen and her henchman Nathaniel (Timothy Spall) in hot pursuit.Amy Adams does an excellent job portraying Giselle, having the personality and traits of that of a fairytale princess - graceful, prim and proper, as does James Marsden in portraying Prince Edward - gallant, brave and strapping. Alan Menken brings back the musical magic of Disney with his score, and the songs he and Stephen Schwartz wrote were delightful (I especially like the catchy and top-tapping dance number, That's How You Know).Kevin Lima did a great job directing and included in the film just about everything that makes a classic Disney movie: beautiful hand-drawn animation, magic, songs, prince, princess, evil queen, talking animals, castle, sword-fight, just to name a few. I love how it references past Disney movies, from casting actresses Jodi Benson (voice of Ariel), Paige O'Hara (voice of Belle) and Judy Kuhn (singing voice of Pocahontas), to including the song ""Part of Your World"" in the soundtrack and having a restaurant named ""Belle Notte."" I just wished we saw more of the Prince Edward character, as I thought he could have contributed more to the plot, and would have liked to see more of Susan Sarandon's Queen Narissa character in the city, spewing magic spells everywhere on unsuspecting people.Overall, though, this is a perfect film for the entire family that delivers all the fun, innocence, charm, adventure, drama, romance and friendship that lets you forget about your worries and enjoy what life has to offer.Grade A-",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Forever and Ever,"Greetings again from the darkness. A Disney fairy tale like the old classics ... only this time brought to life! Beautiful princess to be, charming, handsome (though somewhat daft) Prince, evil witch/step-mother, bumbling henchman, lovable little creatures, all wrapped up in a fantastical love story.Amy Adams (so wonderful in ""Junebug"") is magic on screen as the pure-hearted fairy tale princess-to-be who comes to life ... oddly enough in Times Square! Ms. Adams has the bright-eyed, innocence to capture the wonderment and excitement of the damsel in distress who just wants someone to be nice to her. I would love to see the Academy recognize her performance because it is worthy. Her movements and hand gestures and sparkling eyes and upbeat voice are just perfect for the role. Of course, a nomination couldn't possibly happen because this is a sweet film aimed at kids.FINALLY ... Susan Sarandon is perfectly cast! She is not believable as a loyal wife or loving mother or love interest or fact finding reporter. As an evil witch/step-mother she has found her niche. I absolutely love her scenes as she first arrives in real life. James Marsden (""Hairspray"") is also very good as the slightly goofy, but well-meaning Prince come to save the poor damsel. Patrick Dempsey is along for the ride as the single dad who befriends (and maybe more!) the lost princess. Watching his face during the Central Park musical scene is pretty funny.This is one that kids and parents and grandparents of all ages can enjoy.

Wrong Choices For The Cast,"I know this film has been out for a while..and my family has probably seen it a couple of times..and while I think the story idea was a good one..I could not help but wonder why these particular actors were chosen to play the parts they did. Amy Adams is a great actress..but she tends to play the same slightly scatter brained person in every film..here she did just that too. Her annoying behavior would not be something most modern guys would tolerate for very long either. Patrick Dempsey is the ""it"" guy of the moment in a lot of movies...and this was apparently why he got casted here. He seemed too stiff and distant to be believable..maybe that was his lawyer persona coming through..but he failed to warm up much...even when he was in ""dad"" mode with the delightful little girl cast as his daughter. The actress who was chosen to play his fiancé was totally wrong too..she was not really very girly at all. I do not see someone like Dempseys' character being remotely interested in her did not fit at all. I liked Susan Sarandon in her role as the Wicked Stepmother...it worked good. I could have done without the mice and the guy who was hopefully in love with the wicked stepmother...come on...the guy had no chance there..unless he wanted to be a doormat. But...considering it was a fairy tale with a twist...I can see the entertainment aspect too. There were jokes and cute stuff..and it was a good family type film. I just wish the casting had of been better though...even with the happy ending I wanted a little more.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A nice movie with a cheerful story.,"This film of animation and fantasy is based on the accidental journey of a princess to our world. Amy Adams is the actress who gives life to the princess Giselle, young and innocent, happy and hopelessly romantic. James Marsden made a good performance as Prince Edward, but who really makes some chemistry with Adams is her romantic pair, the skeptical and pragmatic Robert, played by Patrick Dempsey. Susan Sarandon is the villain, Narissa. In the supporting cast, Idina Menzel has been relatively well, Timothy Spall shone with his accent and theatrical manners, and a small squirrel, Pip, deserves congratulations.The script is very original, blending our world with the fantasy world we are used to circumscribe to animated films and fairy tales. The pace is fast, things are happening rather quickly. The characters are forced to get accustomed to our world, much less charming and innocent than theirs, and we were delighted to see the countless hilarious moments that result from this adaptation. The animated scenes were very well done and easily brought to our memory the traditional animated films that we saw in childhood. But even some scenes in the rest of the film have made discrete reproductions of some famous scenes of these films, resulting in a very moving homage to this genre. The ending of the film is beautiful but very predictable, there is no surprise in the way it ends, and that is a little disappointing. The film also has several interesting songs, filmed in an original way an normally singed by Giselle.This is a movie designed for families, which will easily please everyone. It's not a fully animated movie, it has minor flaws but it's nice.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A self-satirical spoof of past Disney cartoon masterpieces.,"I have been amazed at the comments of those who hated this movie. They complain of the bad music, the syrupy plot and do not realize that this is Disney's parody of itself. All the characters from Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and Bambi, animals and humans are brought to non-cartoon life as dirty pigeons, rats and roaches. If some viewers cannot get this, they lack a sense of humor. I am not an expert on music, but one of the tunes was catchy enough to have me humming it for an hour, and the fact that the three songs were nominated for an academy award should say something. I though the musical production was typical Disney, what you would see at a Disneyworld production, lots of glitz, costumes, color and movement.

Enchanted: A Magical Blend of Live-Action and Animation That Will Leave You Smiling!,"I recently enjoyed watching the movie, and it was a delightful experience! The film strikes the perfect balance between live-action and animation, which is no small feat. The storyline was heartwarming and funny, with the characters being well-written and likable. Giselle, in particular, stood out with her naive, fish-out-of-water personality, and I couldn't help but root for her throughout the film. In addition to the well-written characters, the musical numbers were fantastic and added to the movie's overall charm. The songs were catchy, and I hummed along to them even after the film ended. However, there were a few moments where the plot felt predictable, and some humor may have been too cheesy for some viewers. Despite these minor flaws, I would wholeheartedly recommend Enchanted to anyone looking for a lighthearted, feel-good movie that will leave them smiling.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

She meets divorce lawyer Patrick Dempsey who is divorced himself and can't figure out why these marriages don't have ""happily ever afters."" Meanwhile, the evil queen sends her goons to kill her, and her prince follows her too. The sexual innuendos turn out to be fine for a Disney movie. I loved the allusions to other Disney films too as Giselle (Adams) tries to adjust to this totally unfamiliar world-the real world- and Dempsey tries to adjust to her, figure her out, and explain things to her.

Definitely a movie.,"I am a 17 year old Australian male; yesterday I traveled to see Enchanted. I had seen the trailers for the movie and didn't think it was a bad concept. I have to say my first preference was Juno but it was sold out so I saw Enchanted instead. At first I kept an open mind while entering the cinema. There were a lot of kids within the movie, as you would expect from a Disney film.After watching the movie for the first 15 minuets, I felt ill. It had soon realized what I had paid to see. It had A predictable storyline, a very easy to see ending. There were many Horrible, horrible scenes, such as the buskers singing scene. I found myself scratching at my face, even mocking the movie itself. The two parts in the movie I enjoyed myself were when the queen reminded me of so many power ranger bad guys and when leaving the cinema.I can not fathom why this movie has been called ""ALMOST PERFECT"" by others, I wonder if these people have a mind of their own or like every movie with a beginning, middle and end.In conclusion I would say this movie was a about as entertaining as a broken slinky.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
"You'd have to be crazy to try, and yet, this film is a triumph","Just got home from seeing this on a rainy night when the electricity went out 3 times during the showing, and yet, the movie still hit its mark! Unbelievable! Who in their right mind would try to make this movie? Actually, even more daunting, who would try to cast this thing? I remember being impressed by Amy Adams in the movie Junebug, but this is different, almost as if she's being asked to go higher and farther with the cheerful goodhearted woman thing than anyone has ever even tried to go. I've heard some say Amy's the new Julie Andrews, but really I think she quite surpasses Julie for the simple reason that her character here is so unreal, you can't help thinking the actors are running on sheer guts and imagination. I can't imagine this movie having been possible even a couple of years ago, they had to have been waiting for the appearance of Amy Adams especially.But the important thing is everyone in this movie does a magnificent job. From the director, to the animators, to the supporting cast members and song writers and choreographers. This is a genuine tour de force and a real triumph over the incredible unlikelihood of putting the pieces of this movie together. There were many children in the audience when I saw this this afternoon and, surprisingly, it seems to have worked quite well for them. I would have thought the storyline a little too pleasing to adults to be able to reach kids as well but they squirmed for about 2 minutes out of the entire flick.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Both endearingly sweet and very funny, Enchanted is a lovable riffing on fairy tale tropes brought to life by a charming cast","In the fairy tale kingdom of Andalasia, Queen Narissa (Susan Saranadon) maintains rule with the help of her servant Nathaniel (Timothy Spall) by making sure her stepson, Prince Edward (James Marsden), never finds a true love and becomes king thereby displacing her. During one of Prince Edward's troll hunts, he hears the singing of a musically inclined girl named Giselle (Amy Adams) who dreams of true love's kiss, and upon their first encounter Edward proposes marriage which Giselle accepts. On the day of the wedding Narissa in the guise of an old hag tricks Giselle into falling down a well and sends her to a land where ""Happily Ever After"" doesn't exist, New York City. Giselle wanders lost through the city as he sunny demeanor clashes with the rude and cynical denizens of the city, but she's eventually helped by divorce attorney and single father Robert Phillip (Patrick Dempsey) after his daughter Morgan (Rachel Covey) sees her. While Robert tries to help Giselle, her carefree whimsical exist clashes with his more grounded life. Meanwhile Robert and Nathaniel come to New York looking to find Giselle as Narissa has entrusted Nathaniel to give Giselle a poisoned apple.The script for Enchanted written by Bill Kelly was acquired by Disney for its Touchstone label in 1997, but it wouldn't be for 10 years until the film was released via the Disney label in 2007. The film was initially written with the same overall premise, but was a much racier R-rated comedy with a sexual slant inspired by films such as Fast Times at Ridgemont High and American Pie. The script went through a number of extensive re-writes and false starts including iterations that would've been directed by Rob Marshall, Jon Turteltaub, and Adam Shankman. Kevin Lima, whose previous credits included A Goofy Movie and Tarzan, was hired in 2005 for the final version of the film with Bill Kelly also hired back to work with Lima on a version that included the same original premise while also paying loving homage to Disney's Golden Age. Upon release, Enchanted was met with critical and audience acclaim with the cast praised for their performances and appreciating the writing for its affectionate send-up of fairy tale formula and tropes without bridging into full-on parody. The movie was also a massive financial hit making $340 million against its $85 million budget. Enchanted is a charmer of a movie and it's thanks in no small part to the cast who give extra life to very strong material.Enchanted features an ensemble cast with an eclectic array of actors and characters who have unique identities and personalities that are impossible not to fall in love with. Amy Adams deservedly was given heaps of prays for her role as Giselle and rightly so as she fits the musically inclined care free and effortlessly optimistic character to a ""T"" and is lovable as a result. Patrick Dempsey is incredibly charming is Robert Phillip whose cynicism from working as a divorce attorney as well as having a wife who left him makes him a good straight man and counterpoint to the whimsical strangeness Giselle brings into his life. James Marsden is especially good as Prince Edward who is to fairy tale princess what Buzz Lightyear was to space opera heroes in that he's chivalrous, valiant, and romantic with all those personality traits turned up to 11. The movie also has some great antagonists with Timothy Spall very strong and funny as henchman Nathaniel, and Sarandon is having a ball chewing the scenery as the wicked Queen Narissa (even if maybe she winks a little too hard at the audience in the climax).The movie features several songs written by the always welcome Alan Menken and not only are the musical numbers expertly staged such as a lengthy sequence in Central Park, but they're also self aware of how over the top they are with Dempsey giving some great reactions particularly in the Central Park scene. The costume designs are equal parts beautiful and ridiculous especially when contrasted against the grounded nature of New York City and the visual effects are also quite good especially in regards to Giselle's chipmunk sidekick Pip who although he can speak in Andalasia cannot in New York City which leads to some solidly timed physical and pantomime comedy.The only drawbacks I can really think of are pretty minor. The climax teeters dangerously close to diving into parody after mostly playing in more subtle fashion with Sarandon's commentary on the tropes missing more than they hit. I also felt that Idina Menzel was a little underutilized as Robert's girlfriend Nancy and while I did like the ending for that character it didn't feel like there was as much buildup for that ending as there could've been. The movie also has one or two obligatory lowbrow gags but luckily, they're not lingered on too long.Enchanted is (for lack of a better word) enchanting. With a smart script and a charming ensemble cast you can't help but love this movie. Some of the material maybe could've done with a bit more spit and polish (and certain gags could've been jettisoned) but what works in Enchanted works incredibly well.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A nice tribute to Disney's tales,"Enchanted is a very cute movie that honors and parodies some elements from the classic fairy tales that Disney has adapted many times in the past. This movie has a very different story from what was seen before in these Disney adaptations, which gives it a lot of freshness. The songs are so great and so memorable, it has some pretty funny moments to enjoy, and the performances by Amy Adams and Susan Sarandon are admirable. Amy plays such a tender character very easy to love. A very recommended film for any Disney fan or to enjoy with the entire family for sure. My final rate for this movie is 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Must See Family Movie,"My family always goes to a movie Thanksgiving Day, so it has to be something that all the kids can watch. Most of the time we see something like the Cat in the Hat, or some other dumb animated movie that drives me nuts the entire time. However, this year we got a real treat with Enchanted.I thought it was just going to be another sappy cartoon story, but it really made me laugh and almost cry even. This is story telling on the level of Disney's The Lion King, or Beauty and the Beast, or others of the great animated classics. For a family movie, this is a must see.Also, it is completely clean. Other shows, like the Shrek series, try to make a funny animated movie, while inserting crudities, but this was clean enough for the entire family to enjoy.I especially liked how Disney poked some fun at itself, and some of its corny moments from movies past. Instead of being ashamed of those things, this movie really embraces them and allows the watcher to laugh at the same things they have enjoyed for years. Consequently, this is a must see for a family movie, and one that I will want to buy as soon as it is out on DVD.Note: The Music and Graphics were also very good, so it might be one that is best enjoyed in the theater.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Somebody help Disney-- they've fallen and they can't get up.,"""Enchanted"" is Disney's newest *dismally* misguided attempt to make money off of something that involves no creativity, no imagination, and certainly no talent.But, alas-- what do you expect from the studio that has produced ""Finding Nemo,"" ""Chicken Little,"" and ""The Little Mermaid""? Apparently, gone are the priceless glory days of such classics as ""Alice in Wonderland,"" ""The Black Cauldron,"" and ""Robin Hood."" Now, the studio has resorted to recycling characters from some of their most undeserving cash cows by relocating them to a modern-day metropolis.The ""Grumpy"" joke wasn't even funny in ""Elf."" The painfully interrupted musical number is an absolute waste of effort. The performances are more lackluster than anything you could possibly imagine. And the absolute waste of Susan Sarandon is a crime too often committed and never forgiven.This would have been a good film if they had decided to make fun of themselves. Instead, they insist that their hokey fantasies are simply ""classic cinema."" However, as is proved quite often, a classic is generally something that's old and liked by everybody except yourself.But face it-- ""Enchanted"" has absolutely no redeeming value. I'm sure even the set custodians were awful at their jobs in this.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
one of the best,I have to say this is one of the best disney movies ive seen. Amy adams really absolutely killed it in this role and it makes me so happy and thats why i love this movie. It gives the best feels. Im going to say its one of the best live action and i wish movies were made like these again. Its magical i tell you. The animation is super super cool and it makes me think like im watching a real disney movie again and not the new disney stuff but liike the old disney stuff.

Great Movie,"Disney has done it again. This is one of those film that has tear jerker moments at the end. Believe me. I cried and laughed throughout the movie. I LOVED IT!

Instant Classic - Amy Adams is the classic Disney princess,"The move starts with a small bit of classic Disney animation which I found nice to see, given that most animation has gone CG. Since this move is based on the classic Disney tale, it fit well into the move. The cast in this movie could not be better chosen. Amy Adams' performance is worth going to see this movie if for no other reason. She deserves an award for her performance. The rest of the cast is also excellent. The acting is perfectly played, blending humor without being too silly and pokes a little fun at the Disney genre but still holds true to it in the end. I am not a fan of musicals, but there is one musical number in middle of the movie that is thoroughly enjoyable. Bravo! This is one of my favorite movies and destined to be a Disney classic I am sure. I highly recommend this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Intolerable,"As if regular life isn't tough enough...and expectations for men to be Prince Charming aren't demanding enough, now women have movie-inspired notions of a supposedly more realistic fairy tale prince....if of course, your supposed real-life savior is Patrick Dempsey from Grey's Anatomy. Supposedly this is how things would play out if someone came from a fantasy land to NYC. (Seriously...haven't we seen enough of NYC? Why not Topeka? Or Louisville? Or Milwaukee? Or Pierre...anywhere but NYC) Only this person doesn't know, or doesn't seem particularly concerned with trying to figure out, or explain where this fantasy land (titled Andalusia for the movie) is. This girl, played with the fairy tale airiness of a princess quite well by Amy Adams somehow emerges in New York and doesn't seem even to have any worry that she can't get home or that her family might be concerned or that she can't call them, or other mundane concerns. All she is concerned about is that her prince Edward find her. I won't give away any more of the movie, but this mixing of fantasy and reality is really insidious. To suggest that New Yorkers would treat people running around, quite clearly without any irony, fighting chivalric fairy tale battles, wearing faux-medieval garb and stabbing people-or that such people-if indeed they were people, would not be a bit more concerned about their immediate safety and how to get back to where they came from, is idiotic. And now, supposedly, we have a recipe for a ""more realistic"" fairy tale. We have no such thing. There is no such thing and women should come to terms with it...this just raises expectations. Yeah, you can say I'm taking this too seriously, and that's fine, maybe in some ways I am, but let's not pretend that entertainment doesn't have an effect on young tweener and adolescent girls. This just muddies the waters further and confuses expectations for young girls...and really, how can men compete with McDreamy? Yeah, I didn't like this movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
How this good this is,"I think this is a really good movie because the animations are very good and the actors are better. I never thought that taking one small idea from other old stories (like snow white) and making them into a awesome movie like that was. I really enjoyed all of the movie and it shows that true love always wins over evil, sometimes you may not even notice it though. This movie is funny, romantic and also has a lot of comedy in it. There is no swearing so this movie is best for kids and for adults to watch to. Nothing is violent so I think that this should be one of the top movies of all time, and the animations can go along with it. It may seem good at the beginning but it gets better at the end but I'm not going to give it away because the ending is to good for anyone else to know about it without watching the movie. The actors and songs are the best thing to this movie because they can sing really pretty and the songs will get stuck in your head if you don't be careful.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Walt Disney know how to laugh at themselves with style,"""Enchanted"" is an amazing family film for all to enjoy. The thing that makes this film work is that is is a sort of spoof of conventional Disney films: the distressed princess, the evil stepmother, the airhead prince and the many references to many of Walt Disney's greatest works. The film starts in the animated world where we meet Giselle and due to a certain chain of events she finds herself falling down a well ending up in the real world of New York (had to be America) She learns more about the real world while Prince Edward is coming to her rescue. ""Enchnated"" provides fresh, original, classic feel songs such as ""How does she know"", ""So Close"" and ""Happy Working Song"" for which all can enjoy and sing to. Even though this film is a sort of spoof it is not a cynical spoof (for it is Disney taking the mick out of themselves) and thats what makes it work and light hearted. Full of innocence and joy, this is a film not to be missed.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Enchanting,"Enchanted really is enchanting. it is a fairy tale and its corny and predictable. but it is also sweet, funny and magical. its not so much about two worlds colliding but more of the two different worlds merging together.the plot is quite simple but it is a fairy tale after all, and they are not supposed to be complicated. it also has a Disney moral which is wonderfully true.it has a wonderful cast. Patrick Dempsey as a closeted romantic hiding behind a sober and cynical mask. Amy Adams is innocent and childlike but beautiful in a fairy tale kind of way and you believe easily Robert would fall for her. James Marsden is perfect as narcissistic and slightly dumb Prince Charming. and Susan Sarandon, she is the Wicked Witch with Class.then there are the songs. now I finally understand all the Oscar nomination. they are simply beautiful.

Best G rated film I have seen in years,"I took my 6 yr old daughter to this movie for her birthday treat, thinking I might get a chuckle or two while she was oohing and aahing over the prince and princess concept. What a pleasant surprise! Disney pokes gentle fun at itself throughout the entire movie - a la The Simpsons (skewering it's own Fox broadcasting on TV.) All the hilarity and potential complications occurring from a clash between Fairy tale land Andalasia and it's un-streetwise inhabitants and present day New York city make this a must-see movie for everyone. Humor occurs on 2 levels so both adults and children can enjoy the romp and the casting is spot on. Amy Adams and Patrick Dempsey have a nice chemistry and Susan Sarandon is hilariously over the top as the wickedest stepmother ever. Don't miss this one.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Why I voted 1,"this film was a disappointment to the whole family, even though it is some of Alan Mencken's best music. I don't know what Disney films they were trying to parody but I did not recognize any of the princesses or princes. In none of the animated features are they so ignorant and stupid. It was like they were trying to poke fun at them but they only had their own jaded views of the films in their minds without even knowing the real films well. I hope this is the last of the Disney ""dark years"" films where it was uncool to sing and be idealistic. If you think the other animated features were all corny and bad then you will love this Shrek-esqe take on them. If you know the films avoid this lame duck. Lets all hope Lassiter brings back the Disney magic.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

"There only one ""real"" reason to see this movie!","I am not going to write a long review for this movie. Plenty of folks here have filled everyone in on the plot line, assuming you couldn't get it from the previews.I am going to say that the film is just moderately clever, the fish-out-of-water cliché', with a few nice inside jokes AT Disney's expense. A very cute CGI chipmunk makes the movie fun, as it did in ""Over the Hedge"". For a lot of reasons, this movie is just so-so, family fair.That being said, this is one of the BEST performances by an actor or actress that I can remember, in a very long time. Amy Adams is simply delectable! I am very surprised at my own review here as, at first, I found her performance getting on my nerves. But throughout the entire picture, she remains totally ""in--character"" and it works! She is spellbinding in her ability to stay so ""up"" and in wonderment, as if she were, in fact, an animated Princess thrown into a live-action world.I was pleasantly surprised at how one actress can overwhelm a picture and captivate the audience. This is what they mean when they say "" an electrifying performance"".See it for the fun, see it for the family.

"A Great Modern Take on Disney Princess Films,","Enchanted is a great movie with a very well written storyline and a great cast.Amy Adams and James Marsden are certainly the best in this movie,they both played characters that were nothing like any characters they played previously and it seemed like a risky career choice to be playing real life versions of a fairy take prince and princess,but it didn't effect their career in any way and they did a fantastic job.The movie pokes fun at several Disney animation films throughout that are really funny and that the whole family would get.My favourite part about this movie was the music,every sing was stuck in my head until the next song came along and it's no surprise three of the sings were nominated for Academy Awards,the best song definitely being ""That's How You Know"".Enchanted is a very enjoyable movie that I would highly recommend as a family film.A girl living in a fairy tale world's life is turned upside when an Evil Queen transports her to New York City.Her future prince comes to save her,but she begins to like the real world and the people she meets there.Best Performance: Amy Adams Worst Performance: Rachel Covey",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Different Ever After,"This is the story of good, evil, trust and betrayal. It is about a young prince, his bride, the evil stepmother and her henchman. It is Snow White, Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty (with a little King Kong) all rolled into one. But this is not your typical Disney film.Enchanted is all about Giselle who, apart from belting out a song; can cook, clean, and sew all with the help of her best friend, Pip (who just happens to be chipmunk) and the rest of her little forest friends. She lives in the kingdom of Andalasia and is searching for her one true love. Prince Edward, with help from his valet, Nathanial, has just rid the fairy tale world of another troll, hears her song and rushes to find her. The two fall in love on the spot, he proposes, and a marriage is planned for the next day much to the dismay of his evil stepmother, Queen Narissa. She wants to keep the crown all to herself and will go to any lengths to stop this strange woman from marrying her stepson. So on the day of the wedding, as Giselle rushes to get to the palace on time, she is pushed by the evil queen into a place where, as Queen Narissa puts it, there are ""no happily ever afters."" Giselle winds up in the middle of Times Square in New York City where she happens to be stuck until Prince Edward comes to save her. Along the way, she is rescued by divorce lawyer, Robert and his little 6 year old daughter, Morgan who give her temporary lodging. Will the Prince finally show up? Will she find her true love and will it turn out to be Prince Edward? And will she finally find her way back to Andalasia? The first half of this film is fun, while the second half is very predictable, but go with it.Three standout scenes include Central Park, Let's Clean the Apartment and the Kings and Queen's Ball. This is Disney spoofing on Disney with three of their all time classic films, with many hidden references to other Disney notables. Amy Adams has a wonderful voice and she fits into the Giselle role perfectly. James Marsden of X Men fame, hams it up in his standout performance as Prince Edward. Susan Sarandon looks like she's having a great time as Queen Narissa. If you love Disney as much as I do, this is the film for you.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wonderfully Whimsical,"I remember the first time I saw the trailer for this - I was disinterested. Then I saw the part with James singing in the park and he gets hit by the bikers, and I was sold. I had to see this.This was beyond expectations and enjoyable in its own right. The animated scenes in the opening were delightfully self-aware, playing into standard Disney clichés without being too on the nose. In fact, I'd argue that they hit the sweet spot perfectly! It was the perfect length, giving us the setup we needed for the rest of the film without overstating its welcome or use.The transition to the real world was cute. A bit hammy, but that is the point. The absurdity of Giselle contrasted against the seriousness of reality is what makes this charming.This was perfectly cast. None of the performances were weak, and they hit all the cues on the head.The music was done so well. Each of the singing numbers served the plot/character development, and again highlighted the absurdity of the story. I daresay they were even catchy in their own rights.This was also littered with Disney Easter eggs, and didn't feel forced or on the nose. My favourite was Jodie Benson as Robert's secretary.Overall, a fun film. Great for what it is and an instant classic!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Dreadful.,"This was a pathetic attempt, despite a couple of quirky and fab moments. Enchanted was an utter disappointment, and I am in complete shock at its high rating on IMDb. This film had a fantastic and original idea, I must say, but sometimes things don't work out. The film at times was too cheesy it made me cringe, and it got so terrible, that I walked out of the theatre with my friend near the end of the movie (So I did actually see basically all of it). There is a fine line between good cheesy, and too much cheese for one film. This was too much. The acting was rough, and alright. Nothing which made me go wow. Some of the ideas though turned into catastrophe. For example, the over the top dance numbers which made me what to throw my drink at the screen. The film was just dreadful, to say the least.Although, I am sure there are little girls who would enjoy the film, basically only because there is a pretty little princess in a pretty little gown who had to marry a hunky prince, and has a squirrel friend who talks. Other than that, I suggest you stay away from this film. 4/10.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
An Enchantingly Beautiful Movie!,"""Enchanted"" is a delightful animation/live-action tale of the young and beautiful princess Giselle (played superbly by Amy Adams) who wants only to marry her perfect fairytale Prince Edward (James Mardsen) and live happily ever after.

Lives Up To It's Title,"When I saw the trailer for this movie, I thought 'Funny trailer, but not going to work.' Having seen it, I'm more than happy to admit it is fantastic.Giselle is saved from a troll, by Prince Edward. In true fairy-tale fashion, they decide to marry and live happily ever after. However, Queen Narissa plots to get rid of Giselle, and with the aid of Nathaniel sends her to another world - ours. Can Prince Edward and Pip, a chipmunk(!) save her?Bill Kelly deserves immense credit for his script. It's packed with subtle references to previous Disney animated movies, but is also very, very funny.Kevin Lima directs well, the highlight being a big musical number in the park done in typical Disney style as Giselle starts singing, leading to everyone joining in. My own favorite scene though is the cleaning of the house. Showing from Giselle's point of view, it's done like a typical Disney scene, a-la Snow White. When Robert Philip, whose house it is enters the room all he can think is his house has been invaded!The cast enter into the spirit of the movie brilliantly. Susan Sarandon, despite limited screen time, is suitably evil as Narissa, Patrick Dempsey does well as a cynical lawyer slowly changing as Giselle's spirit and attitude wear off on him. James Marsden as Edward is heroic, but best of all is Amy Adams as Giselle. Her performance is funny and charming. I think it deserves an Oscar nomination at least, it is that good.The animation at the beginning is done in the style of Snow White, Cinderella, etc. which brings back memories of growing up with those movies. The CGI used for Pip in New York is fantastic. The musical numbers are worked well into the movie. Yes it has a typical Disney happy ever after ending, but so what? It is still a fairytale.This is a movie the whole family can enjoy over and over again and might, in time, become a true classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Classic Disney,"This movie is amazing and it is the first Disney movie in a long time that has the classic Disney magic. Amy Adams is also so talented and though she probably wont win any awards since it is a kids movie, she definitely deserves some. She definitely has the potential and skill to be the next A-list actress. Also James Marsden and Patrick Dempsy demonstrate that they are star material and have a bright future ahead of them. This movie was also really funny. I went in thinking it was gonna be another lame parody of fairy tales (cough*Shrek the Third*cough) but it was more then that. Instead of making fun of it it paid tribute to the old Disney movies. I'm a teenage boy so people would think this movie wasn't aimed at my demographic but it didn't matter because i still loved it and you will love it.

Best family film of the year!  I highly recommend it.,"Looks like Disney's done it again; I am sure this movie will become an instant classic. I went in to the movie with pretty high expectations, and I must say I wasn't disappointed in the slightest. Amy Adams as Giselle was simply a joy to watch and James Marsden as Prince Edward was hilarious. Susan Sarandon as Queen Narissa was appropriately sinister and vile. Alan Menken's music was beautiful and, in a word, enchanting. Adams has a lovely singing voice, which I found a pleasant surprise. I especially enjoyed the tongue in cheek humor. Disney did a great job parodying their typical style, but at the same time, it was not overdone. Some of my favorite sequences were done as a parody. I found myself laughing (out loud) harder during this movie than any movie I have seen in a very long time. I especially enjoyed the over all clean-ness of the movie. There wasn't anything that I would be uncomfortable letting a young child see, which is a breath of fresh air in today's entertainment world.

I really wanted to like this movie but..........,"First off, let me say, I love Amy Adams. I think she is a wonderful actress, and she was a large part of why I wanted to see this movie. She was wonderful in this role, as well, without being annoying -- which could easily have happened, were this role put into the wrong hands.I'm not a fan of Patrick Dempsey (what the heck is the big deal over him, anyway?) and felt like there was very little chemistry between him and Miss Adams. His performance was very wooden, early in the movie.This movie had everything in it that I hate about Disney: product placement, product placement, product placement. I could tell you, from the opening scenes, where the marketing was.And it didn't make me laugh. So sad. It could've been a good film.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Magical movie!,"To think I was to register at IMDb to comment on a Disney-production! And at that, one with music and dancing and all the sweetness only Disney can deliver? But here I am, and I felt compelled to.After watching Enchanted I logged on to IMDb with the thought that THIS movie could not have received any bad reviews. Well, there were 68 negative reviews, and I am wondering what the world is coming to..How can anyone not like this movie? It is a great traditional fairy-tale story mixed into a funny romantic comedy for the whole family!Others have described it in so many good ways so I'm just going to say this: I am as far away from the intended audience as you can get to this movie. I mostly like gritty, realistic movies where romance usually ruins it all for me. But this IS a fairy-tale/romantic comedy. And on those premises this movie is an instant classic for me.I think beside the great humour, music, story, actors and special effects, this is a movie that truly awaken the child in you.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A feel good movie to brighten anyones day!!,"This Disney movie is perfect. i watched it last night and i still have the songs in my head. The animation is just like all the Disney movies so you instantly get a feeling of being 10 again. The film is full of wonderful moments and songs and has its typical Walt Disney happy ending. The performance by Amy Adams was amazing. She was just like a Disney princess in real life! Its impossible not to fall in love with her! I don't recommend this movie to anyone who like real movies with realistic issues, with this movie you have to just go with the flow and think of all the other Disney movies!! Do not question anything and you will truly enjoy this! Also another thing about this movie is it REALLY funny. On many occasions i found myself laughing out loud(but really loud). This movie has put me in a really good mood and i will definitely be getting it once its released on DVD!! I recommend it to all ages especially if you need cheering up!! Well done Lima!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
You will love the fairy tale characters,"(My Synopsis) Giselle (Amy Adams) lives in the fairytale kingdom of Andalasia and is dreaming of her prince charming, so she can share her ""true love's kiss"" with him. Prince Edward (James Marsden) hears Giselle singing in the forest and knows that she is his one true love and rides to her to take her hand in marriage. They will wed the next day, but Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon) has other plans. Queen Narissa doesn't want Giselle near her throne; she banishes Giselle to the real world where she becomes a real woman in modern-day New York City. Robert Philip (Patrick Dempsey), a divorce attorney, comes to Giselle's aid. Giselle makes friends with Robert and his six-year old daughter, Morgan (Rachel Covey). Giselle begins to fall in love with the charming, but imperfect Robert, but she is promised to Prince Edward who is far, far away. Prince Edward, along with Giselle's chipmunk, Pip, arrives in New York City to find Giselle. His servant, Nathaniel (Timothy Spall), is the next to go through the portal to help the prince find Giselle. They are about to experience something new and completely different than their storybook world they left behind.(My Comment) This is one of those cute fairytale family movies to which you can take the whole family. It is a lot of fun to watch, and you will fall in love with the characters. The movie is part animation and part live-action. You don't really notice the change, because it feels like it is natural. You will love the scene stealing chipmunk, Pip. Amy Adams does a great job of being the beautiful and innocent princess who is like a fish out of water in New York City. You will be completely absorbed in the movie, because Disney knows how to make fairy tale movies. Disney incorporated small details from old fairy tales, such as Cinderella, Snow White, and Sleeping Beauty into the movie's plot. This is one feel good movie that has, of course, a happy ending.

Whats not to like?,"First off my favorite movie is Predator. While in town I went and watched 4 movies in the theater. No Country for Old Men, The Mist, Beowulf, And Enchanted. Enchanted was my cousins girlfriend's idea. I would have to say I enjoyed Enchanted the most. So this is a recommendation from a sci-fi, violence loving, movie goer. Watching the Animated scene in the beginning was something else. I thought I was laughing just because it was so over the top fairy tale BS, and there was no way I could last through much more of it. Then I realized that it was just all ironical humor. Kids will never realize this and enjoy the movie for all its fairy-tale goodness. But adults will love it for all the stabs it takes at fairy-tale goodness. Just a great movie! PS Beowulf left me disappointed, No Country For Old Men, although great, left me wanting finality, and The Mist,although enjoyable, left me a little bit depressed and disturbed.No matter who you are or what kind of movies you like, you probably should go watch this one.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Too violent for young children, no continuum.","Not impressed with this movie at all. The storyline is basically a mish-mash of some of the old, successful Disney stories: Cinderella, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and even Mary Poppins (the central park dance routine is very reminiscent of Julie Andrews, Dick van Dyke and the kids dancing in the park before they jump into one of the chalk pictures on the sidewalk), and anything else you are sharp enough to detect in there. That is not the problem. In fact, that is kind of fun. Revisiting bits and pieces of our old favorites...Part of the problem lies more in the cutesy, gratuitous violence that runs rampant throughout the movie, especially the ""funny"" yet ""cute"" sadistic touches. I have never even liked it when filmmakers insert the highly overdone cat screaming or dog howling in pain in the background when someone inadvertently tosses something aside and it finds its mark. What is funny about hurting an animal? Well, in Enchanted, the torturing of animals is not accidental, it's deliberate and very disturbing, to say the least. Even though it's being done to a cartoon chipmunk, that somehow does not make it any less upsetting. If I were a parent, I would not want my child watching this kind of behavior, especially since it is being characterized as ""funny"" and ""cute"". It is neither, and children should not be taught that it is.I very much recommend that parents take a look at this movie themselves first, before exposing their children to it. Do not judge this movie by the cover. It is definitely not suitable for small children. In fact, I wish I hadn't seen it myself.Other than that, the other part of the problem is that the whole storyline is a big piece of disorganized fluff. There is no more basis for the romance that blooms between Robert and Giselle, than there is for the one between the Prince and Giselle. And Giselle runs around risking life and limb to go chasing after her Prince, only to be completely sidetracked, once they find one another, by her ""feelings"" for Robert, who has heretofore shown little else but irritation with her. And his irritation gets magically transformed into deep love for no tangible reason whatsoever.... Fairytale, indeed! Makes no sense at all.I loved Amy Adams in 'The Wedding Date'. In fact, she's the reason I wanted to see this movie too. But, sadly, not impressed here. The acting is very mehhh... The storyline struggles - a lot. And the whole package is just not what I would expect from a movie of this caliber, with these actors. Too much trying too hard. Not enough real fun. No actual substance. Saccharin as can be. By the time it was all over Amy Adams' face must have really hurt from all that forced cheery smiling. I wonder how long it took to recover muscle control after the shoot?",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
High Rating because one scene is so great,"There are movies that have conic scenes that no one can forget. The scene ""How does she know"" is one of the greatest movie scenes that I cannot forget or ever get tired of. It is uplifting and inspiring. From the spontaneous introduction to the grand final chorus around the fountain.Later, I walked through Central Park looking for all shots of the song. I remember sending a link to sister in law at the time dying of ovarian cancer to lift up her spirits.Of course, I rewatched the movie to prepare to see the sequel ""Disenchanted"". If it wasn't for my favorite scene, I would rate it 7. Worth seeing again.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
This is the point where I would mock the movie by alluding ironically to its title but this time it's actually kind of fitting. So yeah.,"Superb pastiche of the classic Princess Movie that manages not only to deconstruct the formula with mocking venom but also win us over in being a great example of the genre.This was where we were in the early to mid 2000s: we were starting to really see the heteropatriarchal undertones of this kind of movie and its vapidness without really wanting to put it to bed. Tangled was us bursting through to the other side with the contradictions reconciled, but until then, we NEEDED this movie reflect on our relationship with the Cinema of rushed courtship, gender based characters and feeling sorry for Feudalists.As a comedy of culture clash, the urban and the fantasy play mystically well against each other and we have one of the few really convincing romances in disney where idealism meets jaded adulthood and the two bring out the best in each other.I really feel all ages can get something out of this as well as both fans of the Princess movie and those who love to mock it, even if the latter might have to just read a bit of Greer during the lovey dovey moments (which I'm totally into as much as I love Germaine).",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Too silly and cutesy,"I expected a typical Disney fairytale with adult punchlines. Enchanted was too sugary sweet for my taste, and provided only a handful of chuckles. It was worth watching once (and for free, I might add since it was shown on a cross-country flight), but not worthy of purchasing unless you have little girls that are obsessed with the ""princess"" ideal.Furthermore, most of the film is terribly predictable and unoriginal- although I suppose anyone who views this movie out of any actual desire to see it probably expects this. On the other hand, when the storyline finally reaches beyond the scope of predictability, it becomes ridiculous. And as much I would like to commend Disney for the reversal of gender-roles at the end, it seems to be more of a mockery.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Had a Smile on My Face the Whole Time,"I had a smile on my face the entire time I was watching ""Enchanted."" Well, maybe not the whole time ... a chipmunk is sorely mistreated and I did worry for him.""Enchanted"" is something special. It will be remembered as a movie that proved how even today's jaded audiences can embrace a film with no graphic sex or violence, a movie with a truly sweet soul.""Enchanted"" does include special effects, but its real special effect is Amy Adams' performance. I fell in love with this girl. I don't know how long it's been since I fell in love with an actress. I'm really tired of the trampy style that rolled in with Madonna's career.Amy Adams conveys genuine sweetness. You really want this girl to live next door, to be your best friend, to marry your son. About how many tramp-style starlets can we say any of these things? ""Enchanted"" lets you know it is something special with its very first scene. A rich, warm, blessed voice narrates  Julie Andrews! I knew I was in good hands. The opening animation is . . . well, enchanting. I was swept off my feet by this lovely animation. I had read very positive reviews of ""Enchanted"" and here I was loving the very first scene, and I thought, ""This is too good. It can't keep being this good."" But it did, largely thanks to Amy Adams. Magic turns Giselle from a cartoon character to flesh and blood Amy Adams. Adams finds herself dressed in a fairy tale princess gown, but stuck in a Manhattan sewer. Adams moves her fingers and arms like a ballet dancer, in order to express . . . enchantment. I was enthralled.Patrick Dempsey is very good as Robert, a cynical, 21st century lawyer. Dempsey plays against his ""McDreamy"" good looks. He conveys real burnout. Competing for Giselle's hand is James Marsden, utterly perfectly cast as Prince Edward, who gallantly saves a busload of midtown Manhattan peasants. Rachel Covey is adorable as Morgan, Robert's motherless daughter. There is a talking chipmunk who all but steals the movie. And Susan Sarandon, or someone, shows up with hag make-up that curls your toes.There's an exuberant dance number in Central Park, reminiscent of Disneyland's ""Small World"" display, and of Vincent Minnelli, MGM musicals. It just got better and better as it went on.So, why haven't I given ""Enchanted"" a ten? The script. Fantasies work best when they tell truths about real life. Classics like ""I Married a Witch"" made the fantastic believable, and told us something about reality that a more realistic movie couldn't tell. ""Enchanted"" could have been a tad more plausible, and it could have given Robert and Giselle more developed scenes where her naivete and his cynicism, and her change from a cartoon character to a creature who can feel anger . . . and another response she's not ready to give words to, and his change from a man who wants to get rid of her by handing her some bills to someone quite different, were more emphatically dramatized. There are those scenes  Giselle's response to Robert's work as a divorce lawyer, for example  I just wish they had been better crafted with studier writing.But no criticism should keep you away from ""Enchanted."" It really is a movie I'd recommend to anyone, and if you don't smile the whole time you are watching it . . . maybe the only cure is to watch it again.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney make another magic movie.,"This love story with a twist in the tale makes Enchanted a highly watchable family film with all the charm and good family and moral values, Easy to watch and very engrossing.A clever mix of animation and real world stories mean that there is always something to catch the eye and keep the mind active in this updated fairy tale.Classic Disney wicked witch is beautifully captured by the ever alluring Susan Sarandon who must have had this part written for her as it could not have been played by anyone else.Amy Adams as the princess,and most of the rest of the cast are hugely likable even the overbearing prince is warmed to easily,obviously Tim Spall is the exception as Nathaniel the wicked witches sidekick,the man can do no wrong and is a true legend.All in all great family entertainment that is really worth putting yourself out to view,will become a kids favourite and will wear out parents and DVD players alike when it is released for home viewing.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Disney movie for people who hate Disney movies,"Oh, my... ""Enchanted"" is just fantastic.

If you like, ""Enchanted"" is a Disney movie for people who hate Disney movies. Comedy for the kids, knowing in-jokes for the adults and a brilliant central performance by Amy Adams as Giselle, cartoon ingenue come to life, all wide eyed innocence and fluttering hand movements. If you see a more game and better comedic performance this year, please let me know, but I doubt if you will. Amy Adams is just wonderful.Great supporting performances from cynical divorce lawyer with a heart of gold, Patrick Dempsey, more square jawed that any man in history, James Marsden, villainous hag and evil witch queen, Susan Sarandon and snivelling henchman, Timothy Spall.

Setting girls everywhere up for future disappointment...,"and people wonder why women have this fantasy about ""prince charming"" - i understand the desire to live the fantasy but at the same time, can we please get real and stop growing our children to believe in these ridiculous little fairy tales about relationships? Life is not like these movies. Not even close. Even if you DO find an amazing relationship, it's still NOTHING like this. Real life isn't always flowers and butterflies and gorgeous, rich men sweeping beautiful women off their feet into never, never land. Get real.here's another ridiculous stereotype that keeps being perpetuated by films like this: step-parents aren't always horrible people. I understand this is a movie with the element of being an old fashioned fairytale but why make the step-parent out to be this grotesquely selfish, money-grubbing psycho? good way to make all young kids automatically believe that step-parents are mean and awful.movies like these are why so many women now have these impossible standards for men. so many women now will waste so much of their lives pining away for that imaginary prince charming (who never appears) that they may miss out on a great relationship with a REAL man. it's disappointing that we continue to make these false ideals OK in today's society. it's bad enough women can't ever be perfect enough in their own eyes because they're living up to images of women who represent less than 1% of the female population (models, actresses) - but then throw on top of it this fairytale model of a relationship.and men wonder why so many women are so completely obsessed with the big wedding and the white princess wedding gown... this is where they learn it.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Yeah, I was enchanted, too","I went along at the insistence of my seven-year-old daughter, who saw the trailers on the Disney channel. On a wet bank holiday Thursday, there wasn't a lot else to do. Entering the theatre, I thought, 'Grin and bear it.' Oh well, call me Grumpy... What a cracking little film! How could they NOT give a Best Supporting Rodent award to that chipmunk? The mime is the funniest thing I have seen in ages. James Marsden as the prince raises at least a smile in every scene he appears in - his 'peasants' line never gets old. I laughed, and I cried, too - I can't remember WHY now, but it is that kind of film, you get totally caught up in it. There were even gasps from the audience I watched it with (when the pigeon gets snackish...).I thought Stardust was very well done and now Enchanted comes along and possibly tops it in the feel-good stakes.

A Family Classic,"Amy Adams is brilliant. The live incarnation of a true Disney animated princess. She is the reason this movie works. It doesn't hurt that Patrick Dempsey is a convincing confused pessimistic divorce attorney, and James Marsden is a stereotypical send-up of all the Disney princes. Disney pays homage to its history of fairy tales lightheartedly (unlike Dreamworks, which goes for the cynical skewering). It's easy to be cynical for a cheap laugh, it's much tougher to be funny and gentle about it and still get away with it, and Enchanted does that.The Happy Working song had me laughing so hard, I was crying.

My only observation is that many may consider this simply a children's film.

The animation for the scenes in Andalasia is beautifully done, and the characters (animated) are REAL dead-ringers to the actors in the film: Amy Adams, James Marsden and Susan Sarandon. I love Giselle, and I also love the pink dress in the beginning. You know, if she had wings she could have been a ""fairy"" princess. Admittedly in a way, Giselle is kind of like me: I believe in ""Happily After Ever."" The film was a direct montage to the three Classic Disney Princess movies: Snow White,Cinderella, and Sleeping Beauty, and I love the Disney Princesses. I DO consider Giselle as one of them and Mrs. Adams has been getting rave reviews. I have also bought the new doll wearing the pink outfit of course.

Fun movie,"This was a fun flick to watch. It kept me entertained and was definitely worth the price of admission. I especially liked the work of Amy Adams, she was a gas and very engaging in her role. I have always been a James Mardsen fan and have been impressed with his recent work here and on Hairspray. Susan Sarandon is juicy in her role as the evil step-mother/witch. I liked her tone here. Patrick Dempsey and the young girl were quite good, but the film really belongs to Amy Adams. I have to admit though, I heard women around me swooning every time Patrick Dempsey did something, so obviously some of his female fans may disagree with me on that.As far as the film goes, it is a comedy throughout, with some kinda lame computer-generated action towards the end. For the most part is uses effects very well, but the stuff towards the end looks kinda fake and tacked on. It was the only part of the film that seemed forced or out of place to me. The good news is that it turns it around at the very end and has a satisfying, if a little predictable ending.Good all around. Recommended!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Sweet, soft and lazy","A girl, pining for true loves kiss. A prince, pining for true loves kiss. An evil queen and her oblivious henchman. Yes, it's fairy tale time. Classical Disney style even. Lots of colors, lots of singing, lots of animation. Until... The evil queen plays her evil plot. She sends everyone to the real world, where life isn't as pleasurable as in a fairy tale at all.Enchanted combines animation and live acting by putting them together side by side. The parts slide into each other well enough, but never actually combine. Not bad, not bad at all. The animated parts are good, the live acting is better. The story is pretty much standard, but the way it gets worked into the film is just really good.The film runs the middle between satire, making a mockery of fairy tales and the way things happen in them, and actually being a fairytale itself. It does this very well. It has an amazing amount of good laughs and a good way of exploiting all the positive aspects of a feel good movie. In fact, the only thing I have against it is that it is -very- predictable.8 out of 10 red headed girls, pining for true loves kiss",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very Disney and watchable,"I enjoyed this. It has plenty of jokes and references. It flows well, and there is a joy in New York which is nice to see.One thing I did like was that the stereo type of getting what you want is to bully and be nasty. They have turned this into being nice and not leaving the other characters able to response to do what they want rather than what they are being asked to do. Very Disney, but played well and believable.The one odd thing was that the animation was in HDTV format and the live in 35mm, which felt to me a little odd.

A surprisingly enjoyable take on an old genre,"One of the few perks for being an employee of the Mouse was getting to catch a free employee screening of this film, a film that I wouldn't have otherwise gone out to catch in theaters (or perhaps even on the small screen). I went into the theater with a wary eye, but, in the end, found myself pleasantly surprised and generally not miserable as I usually am when I watch films of this type.I think the thing that kept this film from sinking into the saccharine mess it could've become was a touch of reflexivity and meta-humor as well as a well woven script that does a really good job of weaving themes and story points into a coherent whole. The plot is pretty simple: a Disney princess from a fairytale world gets sent to the real world to prevent her from marrying her Prince and therefore displacing her Prince's evil stepmother/sorcerer. Of course, the real world is no fairy tale. And you can imagine what happens from there, especially if you've seen the trailers.I really liked that there was noticeable character development and the crossing of the perspectives of pragmatic realism and fantastic idealism. I liked how the cartoon characters in ""the real world"" continued to move and emote like cartoons. I liked watching the change in Giselle as she becomes more and more real from spending time in the real world. I liked how absolutely cartoon the villain and her stooge (especially the stooge in disguise) could be. I wanted to see a little more of the chipmunk and wished that the Prince could get more development, but they're ancillary characters, so no biggie there.Despite the fact that the film pokes fun of the Disney romantic musical tradition, it's still quite steeped in it. While making light of the musical singing, there's a real song-and-dance number present in the film, which I felt was the only misstep of the film (don't get me wrong it's a great number, but it sort of grinds against the mechanic of the real world setting). Another issue with the film is that even though it's billed as a children's film, I can imagine that the youngest of the youngsters will get bored during the middle section, where there's a lot of drama and not a lot of stimulating action. Kids were shifting in the theater.Good production values, good writing, excellent musical/acting performance from Amy Adams and the rest aren't bad either, and a good pace. It's not deep--it's a Disney children's film--but it's one that I imagine adults will enjoy as well. A nice surprise, I'd have to say. Recommended for kids and adults who can come up with a good excuse to see the movie, even without kids around. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Disney's ""Enchanted"" is a delightful, adorable and very fun film that has great humor (and parody/satire) for kids and adults!","From time to time, I find myself watching the career of a single actor or actress, watching pieces of their work throughout their career. After having come across the delightful and extremely talented Amy Adams in films like ""The Muppets"" and ""Sunshine Cleaning"", I decided to watch some of her previous work, eventually coming to the Disney release ""Enchanted"", which I'd always intended to watch, but never have gotten around to.This film is one of the best comedic family releases of the decade, if not the single best example. It is a loving homage (and at times, seemingly a parody and borderline satire) of classic Disney and family fantasy. Following a classical animated Disney princess who is transported to modern-day New York City by her soon-to-be wicked stepmother, the film is extremely heartfelt, hilarious and joyful.Adams stars as Giselle, a fairytale princess from the magical (and animated) kingdom of Andalasia, where she spends her time pining for true love's first kiss with her woodland animal friends, including a talking chipmunk named Pip. When the valiant and vain Prince Edward saves her from a troll, she becomes convinced that she's found true love, and plans on marrying him the next day. However, Edward's evil mother Narissa fears losing her thrown to Giselle and tricks her into falling down a magical portal, where she emerges in (live-action, real-world) New York City. After being confused by the cities lack of mysticism and light-heartedness, she is taken into the home of handsome divorce lawyer Robert (Patrick Dempsey) and his daughter Morgan (Rachel Covey), where she learns more about the real world, while teaching Robert to lighten up and believe in goodness and fairytale logic.Narissa (played in voice and live action by Susan Sarandon) sends her henchman Nathaniel (Timothy Spall) to find Giselle and stop her from getting to Edward (James Marsden), whom has traveled to New York with Pip to find her.From there, it becomes a culture clash story as Giselle realizes Robert may be her true love, and feels torn between Andalasia's charms and Edward, and the real world.The film is remarkably well-made. From an opening prologue that is so cliché Disney, it's almost painful to watch (in an ironic, charming and quite funny way), to the culture-clash of Giselle and Edward's transportation, a lot of conventions of Fantasy and adventure are bent and played with.The cast is absolutely wonderful. Adams basically is the film, and plays the role to perfection. There isn't more to be said, other than she is the beating heart of the whole thing, and she's the only actress who could have done this role justice. She deserved all of the praise she got, and honestly could have (and should have) won an Oscar for the role. It's a daring, wonderful performance. Marsden is also extremely notable and is just as good as Adams. Parodying the concept of a Prince Charming, Edward is charming and vain to the point of being likable-yet- unlikable all at once. Marsden walks a fine, fine line, and balances the character quite nice. Dempsey is good as Robert, bringing a realism to the fantastical proceedings, and grounding the film. It's also a nice touch that he's a divorce lawyer, acting as an antithesis to Giselle's visions of true love. Covey is charming as his daughter Morgan, and will melt the heart of parents and children with her innocence. Sarandon is a lot of fun as the villainess Narissa, and she plays the role well, but as the focus is mainly Giselle, she doesn't get much development. Much better is Spall as the semi-villainous Nathaniel, who is a bumbling, lost henchman with more complexity than one might think. He is able to succeed as a villain and a character where Sarandon is somewhat unable to due to their uneven screen time.In terms of production, this is a gorgeous film. Kevin Lima's slick direction adds a lot of character, and makes you forgive some of the lesser scenes, and the script by Bill Kelly is a lot of fun, and loaded with hundreds of Disney references. The score by Alan Menken is very decent, though not as big a focus as one would think for such a silly film, and production and costume design is top-notch. Songs and lyrics by Menken and Stephen Schwartz are wonderfully meta and self- referential, including a song literally entitled ""Happy Working Song"" and a hilarious and beautiful song about how to let someone know that you love them.This praise being said, there are some minor faults. For starters, the villain Narissa is extremely under-developed. She's a classic case of a character who is evil simply for the sake of being evil. Times have changed, and it's hard to accept a villain who is evil for no reason these days in a film. There is also some minor flaws here and there in the animated sequences. The opening prologue does drag a little bit, despite being too quickly paced. It tries to do too much with the opening animation in terms of parody/satire, making it feel a little indulgent and bloated. Some of the humor, while funny, is geared towards adults a little bit too much, which could cause parents watching the film with children to get into awkward conversations trying to explain the adult jokes. Finally, the film really does paint-by-numbers during the third act, which was a bit of a letdown after how wonderful the first hour was.However, these faults, despite being fairly significant, cannot diminish the fact that most of the film is completely flawless. Featuring a lovable, endearing cast and some first-class filmmaking, this one is easily a perfect 10. I love it, and I think it's a great film for families, or even adults looking for a hilarious, nostalgic rush. Check it out!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Happy ever afters don't exist...apparently,"I know, I know. Why would I even watch this, I hear you ask. Well, to put it simply, because Christmas break is over and I'm doing a module on Disney in this new term, so prepare for a few more of these.I understand why this was the first one we watched though, even though I definitely didn't have high hopes for it because I naturally associate the words ""Disney"" and ""live-action"" with wanting to die at this point. Essentially, it's something of a parody of the many princess stories Disney has under their belt, and it does that somewhat well. It's no Cornetto Trilogy or anything, but that doesn't make it worthless.Easily the best thing about it is the performances of the characters from the cartoon world. Amy Adams, James Marsden, Timothy Spall and Susan Sarandon are all great, specifically because they don't stop acting like cartoon characters once they enter the real world. Honestly, I can only imagine how boring this would have been if they gave more natural performances as soon as they were on camera, but thankfully they turned something that could have been unbearably tedious into something pretty funny a lot of the time.The rest of the film isn't anything to write home about, it's directed fine, the writing is okay even if it makes a big deal about happy ever afters not happening in the real world...only to end with a happy ever after ending...I mean, I'm not asking for it to end in death and misery for all parties involved, but it would have been fitting for this to be a bit more mature than a typical Disney princess story and have a message for slightly older kids something along the lines of ""you can still be happy without everything being perfect sunshine and rainbows""...or at least that's what they told me in therapy.The rules concerning what does and doesn't work in the real world also seem a bit inconsistent, like Giselle can summon animals and bewitch people's minds with her godawful songs (seriously it is CRIMINAL that this scooped up three out of five of the best original song nominations at the Oscars that year), but the chipmunk can't talk in the real world? Okay?Maybe I'm nitpicking a bit, but I don't really have much else to say about this. It's unfortunately quite a bit of missed opportunity, but it's a hell of a lot more tolerable than anything live action Disney shovels out these days at least.At least the line ""thank you for taking care of my bride, peasants"" is genuinely one of the funniest things I've heard in a while. What a pompous prat.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
A MODERN Disney CLASSIC!!!,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE!! ONE OF MY FAVORITE Disney MOVIE EVER!!Giselle (Amy Adams) is just lovable, and Amy Adams is just brilliant!!! I can't imagine any other actress playing that role and be as effective. I was not expecting this to be as great as it ended up to be, a pleasant surprise. I was laughing at every jokes, and was touched at the same time. I just can't get over how amazing Amy Adams is as an actress in this film. The first time I see her, actually, and I'm an instant fan. Even the chipmunk (Pip) is really funny and cool! And the kid is adorable!!! The cast is just impeccable!!! What a chemistry between them.Go see this while you still can!!! I highly recommend it. It'll be worth your money and time! I promise you'll have a good time.I fell in love with it, the characters and the movie. I will buy the DVD for sure.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Charm and humor to spare.,"Enchanted begins as a typical, Disney-animated princess story. But after a gorgeously animated intro, it shifts to the real world, and suddenly all the cartoonish clichés and fairy-tale staples are unleashed upon the real world. If that doesn't sound interesting to you, clearly you're childhood was devoid of Disney or you don't have any young relatives in your life.Enchanted is funny enough for any lover of (clean) comedy, charming, and...pretty much enchanting. All the fairy-tale characters fit their roles perfectly. Amy Adams perfectly captured the voice, mannerisms, and wide-eyed naivety of a real-life Disney princess. The Dashing Prince, Evil Witch, Comic Animal Sidekick, Inept Lackey, they're all present and accounted for. Disney did an excellent job of gently lampooning itself, but in such a way that it comes off as more of a loving tribute than any kind of mockery.This movie has a lot of positives, and few negatives to speak of. I was slightly disappointed by most of the songs, none of them besides ""That's How You Know"" were really that memorable. How weird is that for a Disney movie? And occasionally the lovey-dovey factor went a little high for anyone that isn't an eight-year-old girl to be comfortable with. Hmmm, but it is a fairy-tale. so anything else could hardly be expected.Enchanted is clever, sugary sweet, and amusing. Any past or present Disney fans owe it to themselves to see it. And the rest of you (if there's anyone left) should do yourselves a favor and watch a movie that's guaranteed fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney Does The Unexpected...,"It is VERY, very seldom that I go out of my way to watch a PG-rated movie, let alone a Disney film, unless it happens to be one of the classics I grew up with, or it presents something completely fresh, new and unexpected. NOT three words I would usually associate with something from Disney these days, but now I stand forcefully corrected. Not only has Disney taken that time-honored, road-tested (and considerably worn-out) concept of ""Happily Ever After"" and completely subverted it, but they've done it in a way that's shocking, surprising and incredibly entertaining!ENCHANTED is, I promise you, like nothing you have ever seen from ""the Mouse House"" before! Taking everything we've known about fairy-tale scenarios about princesses, handsome princes, evil stepmothers and ""true love's kiss"", it presents it all in a bright, shiny, delicate, bejeweled package with which everyone is more than a little familiar...then drops it off the Empire State Building!Part-animation, part live-action and CG, and definitely part old-time musical, it's the wonderful story of Giselle, a fair maiden longing for her handsome prince, Edward, and the wonderful state of ""happily ever after"" bliss in which they'll live once they meet, fall into each other's arms and are immediately married.You know what's coming next. Edward's mother, The Wicked Queen, isn't about to let some little ""forest rat"" take over her throne, so in a disguise that will be more than a little recognizable, she tricks Giselle on her wedding day and with one of those evil magic spells that every witch keeps handy, she sends the poor girl spinning into a place she never expected...THE REAL WORLD. But not just any part of it. TIMES SQUARE IN MANHATTAN!I could go on for at least a dozen more paragraphs about how great, brilliant and hysterically FUNNY it is when Fairy Tale Land and the Real World come crashing together, complete with the truly startled kind of reactions you or I would have when faced with a princess, a handsome and slightly dangerous prince and even a ""talking"" chipmunk, but I will leave these wonders and the rapture of a tale well-told for you to discover yourself.In the meantime, I have to give crazy props to the performances of all the actors who not only voice the principal characters, but play them in the ""Real World"" as well. Amy Adams is nothing short of perfect as Giselle, as she completely enraptures us with the arc of change she goes through, transitioning from fairy-tale princess wanna-be to a real woman with true feelings. James Marsden is hysterical as Edward, and Timothy Spall hits every comedic note just right as Nathaniel, Edward's sidekick and the Queen's lackey.But these stories are only as good as the heroine and her nemesis are in them, and Susan Sarandon has a ball as Evil Incarnate. Channeling every wicked female figure in Disney lore, she owns the screen every time she's on it - in both real and animated form - and it's 50% because of her that ENCHANTED has a thrilling third act.Patrick Dempsey, Idina Menzel and the supporting cast are all great, but this story definitely belongs to the leads. But most of all, dear moviegoer, it belongs to you, because without our suspension of disbelief, who would even care about what happens in the beautiful, ""ENCHANTED"" realm of Andalasia or even its not-so-moondust sprinkled counterpart, good old N.Y.C.?Disney never stopped making family movies, but it's good for once to see one truly made for the ENTIRE family - kids and adults alike.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

I can't believe it's actually 2007,
it looks, especially one of the latest scenes as it's made today, not.. and yet, you can see that some fine vibe from before, especially that era of movies..
It's just great, that's it!Acting, oh my God!Especially..

Very Amusing,"Think of Disney's ""Enchanted"" (2007) as part ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" (1937) and part ""Prince Charming"" (2001), with a bit of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" (1988) thrown in for good measure. But its real predecessor is Walt Disney's very first production ""Alice's Wonderland"" (1923). Contrary to popular belief Walt's first sustained character was neither Oswald the Rabbit nor Mickey Mouse. It was a six-year old real life girl named Alice. While working for an advertising agency in Kansas City Walt altered a concept from Max and Dave Fleischer's ""Out of the Inkwell"" series and mixed a live actress (Virginia Davis) with animation.""Enchanted"" is all about the juxtaposition of the real world with the animated world. Animated characters become their real life counterparts, and then turn back into pop-up book scenes. As in ""Prince Charming"", a storybook prince finds himself dealing with modern day Manhattan. But this time he is has come to this strange world voluntarily.It seems that his stepmother (Susan Sarandon playing a high mileage version of Snow White's Evil Queen) has transported his future bride Giselle (Amy Adams) to the real world. Adams is quite simply amazing in this role. She has no trouble selling her character's wide-eyed innocence (this is literally true-just watch her eyes). Giselle works her magic on a cynical divorce lawyer Robert (Patrick Dempsey) and his six- year-old daughter. Although the film has no weak scenes I found myself trying to hurry along the portions that did not feature Adams.There are some relatively subtle sight gags; watch for the difficulties Giselle has maneuvering her huge Princess gown around the real world. Also watch for Adams' two musical numbers, ""Happy Working Song"" and ""That's How You Know"". These are absolutely priceless and compare favorably with the cinema's best musical moments.""Enchanted"" might have the decade's widest target audience as it has almost universal appeal. My only criticism is that the effects loaded climatic scene is not nearly as entertaining as the sequences that precede it.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Is it just me?,"I'm sure I'm alone in this but I thought this movie was absolutely terrible! I just adore Patrick Dempsey, which is the only reason I sat through it - and fortunately I watched it on my DVR so I could fast forward through all the lame musical numbers. Amy Adams was annoying beyond belief. And couldn't they have picked a better actress to play Nancy? I just couldn't believe that a smart, successful and incredibly hot lawyer would settle for such a plain Jane. Yeah, there's more to life than looks - but let's be realistic!!! I'm pretty certain the rest of the world loved this movie, based on the rating - but I just didn't get it, I guess.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Perfect farce that is also great entertainment,"In this film the Disney studios did the near-impossible: it is 100% mocking all the traditional Disney ""princess story"" tropes from start to finish, while at the same time using them to entertain from start to finish.The script, songs, and performances work flawlessly in both ways from the start. The animated ""True Love's Kiss"" scene is charming - but charming to excess, quite deliberately. The youngest in the audience are delighted with it,
while more mature viewers know it can't (and had better not!) carry on this way.Soon after the scene shifts to the ""real"" world, some major plot elements become fairly predictable - it of course, because it's a ""Disney princess movie"" and as to those plot elements, that's exactly how you're supposed to understand it. The ""Happy Working Song"" is over-the-top farce, yet at the same time conveys the important message that in this story, the spirit of the fantasy storybook universe will actually work in the nitty-gritty real New York, rather than the two words remaining separate and irreconcilable. Similarly the ""That's How You Know"" musical extravaganza is both delightfully ""Disney"" and absurdly ""Disney"" at the same time; like Robert in the scene, we are mystified, tempted to reject the evidence of our senses, and yet carried away at the same time. It's like the best part of being in Disneyworld, where the ""willing suspension of disbelief"" comes so insidiously easily.Every character is just what he/she should be, just as naive (without being dumb) or just as cynical (without being totally impervious to enchantment) as we could want. Only the evil queen is (of course pure villain.Alan Mencken and Stephen Schwartz topped their best (which is saying a lot) with the music and lyrics, and probably no one but Amy Adams could have filled their songs and the princess role with so much charm without being silly. (And of course ""practically perfect in every way"" Julie Andrews had to deliver the opening narration - who else?)",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
So much to like!,"I had a blast watching Enchanted!Not only is it a hilarious parody of the Disney fairytale formula, it also brought back well known names from Disney's heyday in the 90's. Yes, I'm talking about the masterful duo of Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz who created the music and wrote the songs, so no wonder the film was nominated for three academy awards for best original song.The animated parts of the movie were also a welcomed return to the traditional animation with colourful backgrounds and great character design. But the strongest aspects of the movie were in the sharp and witty dialogue and the wonderful performances by the hilariously over-the-top but still controlled James Marsden as prince Edward and the main character, princess Giselle, played by Amy Adams. The fish-out-of-water story about Giselle and Edward coming to the real world and still acting like fairytale characters was hilarious. Timothy Spall and Susan Sarandon also made a great villainous duo as the classic evil sorceress and bumbling sidekick.If you know your Disney, you'll also spot many references to classic animated movies from the company, some more obvious than others. Several watches recommended just to focus on that alone. I spotted references to Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, Lady & the Tramp, The Lion King and Snow White during my watch for this review.The only thing to put a finger on is that by today's standards the computer generated animal character at times look obviously fake, but not to a distracting degree. The CGI used in the big climax is still rather impressive.I hope other people will find Enchanted as entertaining and wonderful as I did, because it holds high entertainment value and stands well on its own as a Disney parody and a Disney movie at once.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

"It started out strong, but...","After reading some reviews and watching some clips from ""Enchanted"", I decided to give the movie a try. I grew up with the Disney Princess movies, so I thought a parody of them would be hilarious. Unfortunately, I could only last about forty minutes before I had to turn it off.The beginning of the movie is hilarious. The song sequences were so over-the-top, a great parody of the classic princesses. In addition, Giselle's reaction to New York City is pretty funny too.However, as soon as the lawyer and his daughter were introduced into the movie, things went downhill quickly. The lawyer was just so unlikable, and his daughter was annoyingly unrealistic. In addition, Giselle's antics went from being cute to annoying.

It just got stale too quickly.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Enchanted Tale Of Our Times,"""Enchanted"" is another great fairy tale about a princess that must be rescued by his charming prince. But the difference starts when we find out that this story begins in a sort of classic Disney cartoon and it evolves to a motion picture with real actors and placed in the current time, in New York City. This idea really works showing the contrasts of real life when many things go wrong versus fiction life where everything ends with a happy ending.Giselle (Amy Adams) is the princess that wants to find his true love, the man who'll finish her love songs duet. And Edward (James Marsden) is a handsome knight that happens to be her true love in vice-versa. But the witch Queen (Susan Sarandon), also Edward's mother, fears that his place in the castle will be taken by the beautiful Giselle and so she pushes the poor princess into a dwell that led her to recent times, most precisely at 21st century, right in the middle of the Times Square.Now Giselle's is totally lost in time and in the city but she insists to the other people that she needs to find a castle in order to get married with his prince. During one of those walks into the city she meets Robert (Patrick Dempsey) and his daughter (Rachel Covey). He's gonna help her to find his way back home and of course find her prince. But there are more many complications on the way: Robert is getting married with Nancy (Idina Menzel) and Giselle's sudden appearance may ruin the 5 year engagement of the couple; a man loyal to the queen was sent to impeach that Giselle returns home, the funny and deadly Nathaniel (Timothy Spall, excellent), the Queen herself also appears to put her plans in the right direction and Edward seeks for her, to rescue her once again. The funny thing in this story is that she's a happy princess that always believes in happy and romantic endings, and Robert is a lawyer specialized in divorce, and he knows that in real life not always couples stay together. This kind of playful and paradox dynamic worked very well in this film.Another great thing about ""Enchanted"" is the comparisons between the two worlds. Robert presents to Giselle all the differences of the real life but it's not a bureaucratic movie when the character finds many different things and starts to ask what everything's for (this happen only in a scene when Giselle is in the shower and she wants to know where the water comes from). The scenes and the dialogs about what is true love, and the reasons of why or not believe in happy endings and fairy tales are very well written and many times it's the best thing in the movie, working way better than the funniest scenes and the musical moments.All actors are good here (most notably Amy Adams, James Marsden and Timothy Spall), there's comedy and romance, funny situations, well, it's a very entertaining family movie. And of course like in almost every Disney movie, there is a happy ending!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great mixture of fairy tale and modern world,"I always thought that mixing fairy tales with our daily life would make for a bad and cliché movie that only romantic comedy lovers would appreciate. I have no problem with this genre but often they tend to be boring, predictable and uninspired. This movie had indeed its overly cute stuff but that doesn't get annoying at all as it has so many funny moments that you can't find anything to complain about (at least I didn't). I thought setting the fairy tale world of Andalasia up as an animation and having its inhabitants to be real humans when they are in New York was a fantastic idea and I can't think of other movies who do such a good job at that. You will recognize references to other fairy tales such as Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty. However this story and its characters is standing very strong on his own. It's not the typical fairy tale where you know who is going to end up with who. It is something completely new. This movie is definitely worth a lot of re-watches.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Enchanted!,"""Enchanted"" is a Walt Disney's musical film. I am not a big fan of musical films, but I think this film is one of the excellent films! In Andalasia, Giselle and Prince Edward love each other. They promise to marry, however, they are separated each other by Queen Narissa. They come to human world and look for them each other. Actually, I love Walt Disney's films and I often watch them. But this film is a little different from other films. This is half an actuality film and half an animated film. This point fascinated me so much. This is because actuality films make us feel like more real than animated films. I really love this point. If you like Disney movies or musical movies, you should try it! I really recommend you this film!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Truly Enchanting Movie; Disney At Its Finest,"In many respects, I think ""Enchanted"" will hit home more powerfully with adults than children, although there's really nothing here that children wouldn't love too. It's just that this movie seemed to be a step back in time for Disney, to the stories and animation that I grew up with. While it will represent good entertainment for children, for me it was wonderful nostalgia; Disney the way Disney was meant to be. There are references throughout to the classic Disney stories (Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella) and yet the story is refreshingly original with new characters and a plot that is both truly enchanting and hilarious at times.The story starts in the animated story-book land of Andalasia, where Giselle meets her fairy tale Prince Edward and they prepare to be married. Unfortunately, Edward's stepmother Queen Narissa wants to prevent this, as once he marries, he becomes king, and so she banishes Giselle to modern day New York City. Here the movie becomes live action, and follows Giselle (now played brilliantly by Amy Adams) as she tries to come to terms with being lost in this mystifying new world. Here she meets Robert (Patrick Dempsey) - a divorce lawyer who doesn't believe in fairy tales but slowly becomes - well - enchanted with Giselle's sweet innocence. Eventually of course, Edward (James Marsden) comes to find Giselle, followed first by Narissa's henchman Nathaniel (Timothy Spall) and then by Narissa herself (Susan Sarandon). Let's just say that these three animated characters who come to life (along with Pip the Chipmunk, who also makes the journey) turn 21st century New York City on its head.There's little not to like here, although I thought some of the charm was lost once Giselle started to lose some of her innocence and began to accept that life isn't always a fairy tale. That's true, of course, but in all honesty I liked her better as a straight fairy tale character come to life. The song and dance routines in this movie are exceptional, the scenes in which Giselle interacts with New York's wildlife (including pigeons, rats and cockroaches) are delightful and the interplay between the cast members is flawless. You basically know how this is going to turn out pretty early on, although I liked the final twist between Edward and Nancy (Idina Menzel) - Robert's girlfriend. Apparently both Robert and Nancy needed some fairy tale in their lives. It's a great Disney movie. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Disney Magic with a Contemporary Spin,"The 2007 film ENCHANTED is a deft and imaginative musical/comedy/fantasy that breaks several cinematic rules in its execution of a richly entertaining story that intrigues and delights the viewer.The film opens as an animated fairy tale where we meet Giselle, a princess who, shortly before her marriage to Prince Edward, is magically transported to modern day Manhattan, thanks to Edward's mother, the requisite Evil Queen, where she is befriended by an attractive attorney and single dad. Giselle's fish out of water experiences in Manhattan blend seamlessly with the arrival of Prince Edward, the queen's henchmen, and the Evil Queen herself, who also arrive in New York to return Giselle to the kingdom of Andulasia.The story takes most of the turns it's expected to, but the journey there is the fun here, as the the old cinematic chestnut of the fish out of water, is dusted off and refashioned into a contemporary fantasy filled with child-like imagination and adult sensibility.Amy Adams is perfection as Giselle, the princess transported to modern times who believes that love is everything, animals clean house, and pigeons deliver flowers. Adams' wide eyed sincerity and clear as a bell singing voice help to make this performance the flawless marriage of actress and character.Patrick Dempsey and James Marsden are attractive as the single dad who Giselle falls for and her fairy tale prince who want her back. Timothy Spall provides some funny moments as the Queen's henchman and there is a brief, but fabulous scenery-chewing turn by Susan Sarandon as the Evil Queen. Tony winner Idina Menzel (WICKED) also scores as Dempsey's girlfriend (BTW, note to continuity dept: during the course of the film, we see advertisements for WICKED and for RENT, two Broadway shows supposedly running at the same time, that both starred Menzel, but I digress).The film is energetically directed by Kevin Lima and the surprisingly clever song score is provided by Alan Mencken (THE LITTLE MERMAID) and Stephen Schwartz (PIPPIN; GODSPELL). Top it off with some top-notch visual effects and cinema's most durable sidekick, Pip the Chipmunk and you have all the ingredients for a first-rate adult fairy tale that provides some big laughs in addition to the expected warm-fuzzy feelings.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
So nice!,"Disney movies always give us fantastic dreams.This movie has quite new style that the characters travel between the animation world and our daily life and it seems like a time traveling.Of course, they face a lot of difficulties in our world where is unusual for them.The mismatches of Disney person and us is very funny.Also, it has some scenes containing the depiction of Disney's back-numbers such as The Beauty and The Beast.In my opinion, this movie is one of the best works of Disney and I'm sure that it never bores you.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Enchanting Disney fantasy rom com that's good but not great,"Just seen this today at 3pm, and I left with smile on my face and a light, bouncy feeling after seeing it.It starts with traditional 2D animation with our heroine - a new Disney princess Giselle who falls in love(as they do) with Prince Edward. Things are going well, until, on her wedding day, she's pushed down a wishing well by Edward's evil mother, Queen Narissa.So she appears, in our world, as a real-life version, completely clueless to reality when she comes from a place where everything's happy and in song. Luckily for her, she is offered a place to stay reluctantly by divorce lawyer Robert.The few songs sang by Giselle in this: a main, big Bollywood-looking scene, with a memorable stuck-in-your-head classic Disney songs, like That's How You Know, that could've easily have come from The Little Mermaid soundtrack, and Happy Working Song is obviously inspired by Whistle While You Work from Snow White.I have to say, Amy Adams(Giselle) does the princess personality so well, it's excellent and very believable. I didn't even know she could sing! James Mardsen, as her Prince Edward is also quite good and funny as the empty-headed and handsome man searching New York for her, and Patrick Dempsey plays the cynical lawyer alright too. I especially liked how Susan Sarandon relishes the role of the villain Queen Narissa, but she was badly underused and most her plans were non-threatening and uninspiring.Special effects wise, it very good. I really liked the scene where she's changing to 3D form in-between Andalasia and our world - it's impressive, with all the stars and stuff. During the Happy Little Working song number, the animals look quite realistic, and a CGI Pip the chipmunk looks good as well. The effects in the climax could've been better though, as it did look cartoonish(maybe that's the point?), and no where near as scary as it could've been I though. The makeup too(particularly for Queen Narissa nearer the ending when she tempts Giselle) was jaw dropping - seriously, this should win awards just for that alone. I loved the various costumes Giselle wore in New York.There are references to other Disney princess films(Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella etc) and a climax that fans of those Disney films will be familiar with. Sure, I thought they could've been a lot more peril during the showdown between good and evil, though as that was a bit disappointing.It's all together a good family film with some few funny moments and a homage and part spoof to Disney if somewhat cheesy in places and lacks the wit that would've made it better. Mum was afraid I'd taken her to see 'rubbish', when I assured her I hadn't, then she leans over after the first 20 mins in to say ""I was wrong - this is good ... very good, actually"" so she loved it more than I did. Good, but not great to me.",,Anonymous,Animation
Appropriately named!! Enchanted WILL Enchant you!,"My gawd, but this movie is FUN! It's also ""cute, delightful, magical, sweet, and FUNNY!!"" VERY funny. This pretty much takes every fairytale cliché and mops the floor with it. It's Disney's charming 2D animation combined with a modern love-comedy...so what do you get when you do that? AWESOME of course! The acting is superb...particularly Amy Adams and Patrick Dempsy. I have to say Amy outshines everyone. She plays her ""adorably innocent and naive virgin princess Giselle"" role SO naturally that you'd swear she's really like that. Her antics are so over-the-top and she's a just a little ray of shiny sunshine so combine her with the most cynical guy in New York, Robert, and you have one hilariously entertaining duo through the whole movie. And the chemistry between Adams and Dempsy is H-O-T without needing to be inappropriate for kids. They just have it! Yes, there is some subtle innuendo but young kids won't pick up on it. The other characters are just as fun...and I can honestly say I had no problems with ANY of them. They're all likable!! (Prince Edward is a riot!) Add in a brilliant script, songs worthy of Broadway, witty laugh-out-loud humor and beautiful animation scenes and you've got one of the best movies Disney has made in a long long time...and in my opinion, the BEST Princess movie ever made as well. So...why only nine stars? Well.....the villain herself is little weak compared to other Disney villains. Let's just say Sarandon makes a much better actress than a voice actress. Her animated character is eh. She works as a live character a great deal more. But even this doesn't stop me from watching my Enchanted DVD over and over again. XD This movie is amazing. Absolutely perfect for mothers and daughters to watch together as young and old couples alike. The only audience I'd be iffy on are little boys. Might be a teensy bit too girly for them.^^",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Magical Journey!,"We all need a little magical make believe maybe more than ever now and Enchanted by Disney serves it up like no other.Disney has managed to bring its special brand of quality, kindness and fantasy to the screen in the most beautiful way.Wasn't sure about Dempsey and still pondering that. Perhaps a tad too old?But, from the story to the music, costumes, everything was, well, enchanting and a lovely break from a troubled world. And suitable for everyone and age. How refreshing.Would love to see a sequel!Give it a try. Bring your inner sparkle alive again with this offering.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

The work which can enjoy Disney's world and songs!,"This is the romantic work which the world of the fantasy and reality lead to by magic. If it is a girl, the Disney princess longs once. They are pretty, and they who are in love hard are attractive.This movie has two splendid points. The first is character of Giselle who is a heroine. She is a young girl of country Andalasia of the fairy tale and has character that I am selfish in romanticists. However, I have strong faith and am pretty and am a person not to be able to hate. She who was in love with Robert in reality swings him around, but he cannot hate her.The second point is a song sung in a work. It is good for Disney work and is a musical style. The music that I in particular like ""is Happy Working Song"". Giselle singing happily is very pretty and I love it. In the scene where Robert leaves Giselle who begins to sing, I laugh unintentionally.It is in the feeling that I say to do its best when I watch Giselle who tells love to Robert without being discouraged. This is a work giving courage to people.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"To much silly acting,and bad writing","While it was cute and my grandkids may like it,I wish they would have made the princess less goofy.I liked the idea of the story.I was waiting a long time for it to come out top rent.It was far to kidsy,hands across the face, goofy childish dialog,Nothing to show why they were falling in love?I understand it was made for very young children,but could have been a made for everyone movie.Far to immature and not believable as a princess come to life.They should have watched Darrel Hannah in splash,Mature but innocent.It's hard to understand what happened to Hollywood ,Most movies made now suck.This could have been very good but couldn't wait until the end.

instant classic,"i watched this movie just because it was put on and everybody else was watching it. i gotta say i'm glad i watched it, it was a great movie.starting off as cartoon animation classic Disney style with lots of singing and little animals that help the princess and talk to her. oh and not to mention the evil stepmother (but of the prince instead of the princess)Prince Edward (James Marsden) and and Princess Giselle (Amy Adams) are the two that fall in love and wish to be married straight away. but as Giselle goes to see Edward she is confronted by a hag reminiscent of the one from Snow White and i just laughed, and BOOM! she goes to the real world. where she meets Robert Philip (Patrick Dempsey).the Disney characters in the real world is a funny, but great mix as Giselle is always optimistic and believes in 'true love' whereas Robert tries showing her the real life. Pip the chipmunk is just laugh out loud funny and some of the stuff Edward does is too.Great memorable songs throughout.this movie is definitely one for the whole family and will be much enjoyed.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Offering hope to the hopeless,"""Sire, do you like yourself?""""What's not to like?""It is the simplest exchange of dialogue in the movie. But underneath it, whether the director intended it or not, lies layers of meaning. Nethaniel, suddenly seeing things in the light of the real world, asks this question to Prince Charming, whom is looking for Giselle and still stuck in the magical-happy-go-lucky state of mind. Prince Charming is the representation of the old-school Disney, the very simple, clean, wholesome, lovable Disney that every single child grows up with. In the old-school days, dreams come true, the heroes and villains are defined, and beauty runs deep within the main heroine.Nethaniel is new-school Disney, unsure of itself, lacking any posture or ability to stand up and become known. Enchanted is quite possibly the greatest meshing of old-school with new-school, and while Disney self-mocks itself, it also statuses itself as the last main white hope in the dreams of children and adults. In a world full of cynicism, disappointment, and uncertainty over the actions and motives of other people, we all need a little bit of pixie dust to continue life. The question is can an old-school princess survive in a new-school world? Or would the new-school world consume the hopes and mannerisms of our princess? Enchanted stands as one of Disney's best family movies outside the Pixar realm this decade, and ultimately is an amazing celebration of the Disney image and reputation that it has sustained (in roller coaster fashion) for nearly a century.Enchanted is about a princess (Amy Adams) whom is flung into a world where ""dreams don't come true"" according to our main villain Narissa (Susan Surandon). The reason for this is so that Narissa can remain at the throne and Giselle and Prince Charming don't marry. Giselle (in real-life form) winds up in New York City, where she runs into a pessimistic divorce lawyer (Patrick Dempsey) and his curious daughter. While waiting for Prince Charming to arrive to New York to save her, Giselle learns that her new setting is full of people that do not have hope in life and do not believe in a happy destiny. What's worse is that Prince Charming isn't the only one that makes his way to New York from the magical land.The script, written way back in 1997, went through a major series of changes before the final product was unleashed. And my what a script it is. Full of Disney references that could open up an amazing drinking game and full of bubbly fun, the story and dialogue remain crisp, clean, and despite predictable, contains plenty of unpredictable curves. However, the script doesn't make the film: Amy Adams does. Her performance is one of the few in film history that should quality for an Academy Award win, but won't get the nomination because of the content. It's definitely hard to praise the performance of a Disney princess, but Adams does spectacular as Giselle singing and acting-wise; infusing a jolt of energy and spirit rarely ever seen by anybody out there. Beneath her beauty is a bubbly personality that's impossible not to like. Everyone else did a grand job, including James Marsden and Timothy Spall as Prince Charming and Nethaniel respectably.Enchanted's charm comes from its celebration and references to past Disney princesses, and its message about finding hope in a lost world. Just like in the movie, we as a generation of people exposed to the negativity of the world on a minutely basis lose all sorts of hopes in all aspects of life. The Flapper era and the Baby Boomer saga are two eras that just might not be duplicated for a very long time; the care-free, happy-go-lucky, positive time period in which all is well with the world. Walt Disney Studios used to be able to bank on this sort of happy time period. After all, Cinderella, Lady and the Tramp, Peter Pan, and Sleeping Beauty all came out in the 50s alone. Disneyland came out in 1955. That time has passed, this sort of eventual happiness nowadays passes off as clichéd. Even Enchanted itself was tough to watch at first because films nowadays just doesn't have that happy feeling throughout all 90-plus minutes. Even modern-day Disney flicks have a bit more gloom than before: see Lion King, Hunchback of Notre Dame, Pocahantas, Aladdin, and dear goodness Fox and the Hound.The film's greatest strength is more than its humor, charming characters, and ridiculously happy ending; it's the message of hope and finding sunshine in a cloudy day that's screaming out to you within the first, second, and even final acts. Old-school Disney values are flung into New York City and the payoff is grand. Then there's the adorable musical numbers and nice choreography. You just want to hug the movie for being so cute. Even a bitter cynic like me couldn't help but smile throughout the entire thing, no matter how ridiculous it might be.Bottom Line: Disney's old-school allure can be found here, as the celebration of works past and present are sprinkled throughout a creative story full of easter eggs and adorable performances. Amy Adams runs this optimistic show as the film opens up a can of happiness to anyone that sees it; no matter how bitter you claim yourself to be. The film isn't absolute perfection, but easily one of the best live-action Disney works this entire decade. Despite the childish outer look, you must see it for the deeper messages of hope and love. Highly recommend, and its great fun for the entire family. Kudos to Disney for heading in the right direction after years of questionable decisions.""Everybody has problems. Everybody has bad times. Do we sacrifice all the good times because of them?""Not in Disney's watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Return to Disney Magic....always believe....,"I was pleased to note that a sequel to this fine film is in the works, as it should be. Disney deserves to be amply rewarded for this film, and every collector's set of disks should include it. A nostalgic return to Disney's golden age with a refreshingly new twist, it leaves you with a warm and fuzzy feeling about the world. Unabashed sentimentality abounds in this fish out of water romantic comedy that combines the best of 21st century animation and Walt's original magical touch with the kids and adults alike.

I am indeed enchanted,"Giselle, a beautiful young peasant woman, lives in the animated fairy tale kingdom of Andalasia. She dreams of finding true love. True love finds her when the dashing Prince Edward saves her from a giant troll. Yes, this is one of those animated kingdoms with giant trolls. Talking animals too but more on them later. It's also one of those animated kingdoms with an evil queen. Queen Narissa knows that she can not allow her stepson Edward to marry. If he does his new bride will take Narissa's throne. So when it's love at first sight for Edward and Giselle, with a wedding to take place just a day after they met, Narissa has to take action. She banishes the naive, all too trusting Giselle to...New York City? Good luck finding true love there sweetheart.Giselle has not just been sent from Andalasia to New York. She's been sent from an animated world to a live-action one. So out of the sewer and into Times Square steps Amy Adams. And Adams proves to be an absolutely amazing living, breathing, real-life Disney princess. You wouldn't want to imagine any other actress in the role, Adams is as perfect as perfect can be. In this ultimate fish out of water story the challenges Giselle faces are enormous. But as any good fairy tale princess would she faces those challenges with a smile on her face and a song in her heart. It is impossible not to be charmed by the relentlessly upbeat, positive-thinking, romantic idealist Giselle. And so much of the credit for that has to go to Adams who is stunningly brilliant in the role. She certainly looks the part of the fairy tale princess and her personality shines through to the point it's almost a little overwhelming.Of course modern-day Manhattan is really no place for a naive, idealistic fairy tale princess. Luckily for Giselle she is taken in by a single father, Robert, and his young daughter, Morgan. Robert was just about to propose to his girlfriend Nancy but Giselle's presence causes complications. Meanwhile, because this is a fairy tale after all, Giselle's Prince Charming must come save her. Tipped off by Pip, Giselle's talking chipmunk friend, Edward learns where Giselle has been sent and comes to New York to save her, chipmunk in tow. Unfortunately in the real world animals can't talk so Pip faces all kinds of problems of his own as he tries to help Edward find and rescue Giselle. While animals can't talk here Giselle does find a way to put the local wildlife to use. No cute little chipmunks here though, in Manhattan it's pigeons and rats and cockroaches who Giselle puts to work. Quite funny that. Anyhow Narissa knows she can't let Edward bring Giselle back to Andalasia so she sends her henchman, Nathaniel, to New York to finish the job with, what else, a poison apple. Edward is oblivious. It's only our fearless, though now unfortunately speechless, chipmunk who realizes the danger Giselle is in. More hilarity ensues as prince and chipmunk seek to find Giselle.Enchanted keeps a smile on your face throughout. The story is so engaging, the characters so embraceable. Adams is the obvious standout but the rest of the cast is excellent as well. Patrick Dempsey is perfectly cast as Robert, a guy all too grounded in the real world to believe in fairy tales. The exasperation Dempsey shows as his character deals with the impossibly chipper Giselle is priceless. Whereas Giselle begins to adjust to the real world she finds herself in Prince Edward never changes. He's a swashbuckling fairy tale prince brought to life and James Marsden captures that wonderfully. Susan Sarandon as the evil queen, Timothy Spall as her put-upon henchman and Idina Menzel as Robert's girlfriend are all great too. It's such a lively, energetic, flat-out fun film. The film looks fantastic, a fairy tale beautifully brought to life. There are some great songs too, the standout one being That's How You Know which is performed as a gigantic, breathtakingly brilliant Central Park production number. You may think this would be a very predictable story but the movie has some surprises for you, the quest for true love not as straightforward as it seems. If there is any little quibble with the film it may be that it goes a little over the top at the end where the villain becomes, quite literally, too big of a presence. But all in all it's hard not to love this movie. Such a charming movie, with a performance from Adams which is as good as it gets. Adams creates a character who anyone, fairy tale prince or real-world man, would fall in love with. If you love her, and you will, you'll love this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Disney takes the Mickey, its Amy Adams who shines through.","Its Amy Adams movie, the audience knows it the cast knows it and Amy herself knows it. She blissfully steals every scene with her wonderful wide-eyed princess Giselle. Its just a real shame Sarandon's (perfectly cast for the wicked which) could of stayed around longer, and when she does show her face she is quickly transformed into a poorly designed GCI dragon. One of the very few problems with this very good family movie. That small children will find magical and teenagers and adults will find heart-warming.It's true, I doubt I have ever smiled this much whist watching a film making it the most enchanting outing of Christmas 2007. Stuff The Golden Compass, bin St Tinian's. The best family movie out there has to be enchanted.Its been along time since we have had an all round Disney classic. And though enchanted may not be an all rounder (putting several spins onto this worn out story) it has definitely earned the right to be called a Disney classic and Giselle a Disney princess.An animated fairy tale meets modern, live-action comedy. The beautiful princess Giselle is banished by an evil queen from her magical, musical animated land and finds herself in the gritty reality of the streets of modern-day Manhattan. Shocked by this strange new environment that doesn't operate on a ""happily ever after"" basis, Giselle is now adrift in a chaotic world badly in need of enchantment. But when Giselle begins to fall in love with a charmingly flawed divorce lawyer who has come to her aid - even though she is already promised to a perfect fairy tale prince back home - she has to wonder: Can a storybook view of romance survive in the real world? There is no better feeling than when Giselle breaks out into dance half way through the film, you mouth may in fact be sore afterwards from all that smiling.The kids will plead to go see it again and you won't be reluctant to take them. It's true that Sarandon's character isn't very good, and the horrible computer generated dragon at the end is rubbish. But such criticism will disappear from your minds once the feel good ending comes into view, and the smile will reappear. For better or for worse the days of your average Disney tale are over. This isn't your usual fairytale. Its better, tanks to Amy Adams mostly.Though not without its flaws. Enchanted manages to be the biggest and best of Christmas 2007 outings. A big cheer for Adams who steals the show with Giselle. Enchanted has earned a place in our hearts, you will be more than happy to revisit this film. Truly Enchanting! There's just enough might and magic with a outstanding amount of warmth to allow enchanted to make you smile for hours on end. So much so also that its almost impossible to not forgive it for its flaws and misuse of Susan Sarandon.Enchanted takes a poll position on 2007 children's films. It's brilliant that Disney have final getting their own back on DreamWorks Shrek. What with Shrek the third being so painfully average. Bravo.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Clean film for the whole family!,"Movies are getting ridiculous with the profanity, nudity, sexuality, gore, etc. Therefore, whenever a clean movie that has an interesting storyline comes along I am quite delighted.Not only does ""Enchanted"" contain a lovely, spirit-lifting plot, it also lacks the unnecessary and grotesque actions and words so evident in our present society.

disappointing,"I'm 24 and I usually enjoy kids movies, cheesy romance, animated...But this was pretty lame. The characters were shallow and the romance was underdeveloped. In addition, the animated portion paled in contrast to the classics (Sleeping Beauty) or some beautiful more modern classics (Mulan). The music lyrics were cute, but the compositions were uninspired compare to Beauty and the Beast or Little Mermaid. It's watchable if you're desperate for a recent movie to watch with your kids, but you could probably find something better to do with your time.

Too cute!,"The movie opens in what appears to be an old-school Disney movie -- 2-D animated, overly optimistic princess singing and dancing with woodland creatures about true love with a prince, while the wicked queen turns into a hag intent on getting rid of her. By ""getting rid of her,"" she suddenly finds herself in live-action New York, still with the overly optimistic Disney princess mentality, both completely believing that everything works in her favor for Happily Ever After, and and completely not understanding that our world really don't care about her happy ending. She comes across her own NYC prince charming, who falls in love, but still never gets used to her quirks (like bursting into song in the middle of a conversation, with backup.)This is really a tongue in cheek parody of the old-school Disney, done very well.Amy Adams isn't necessarily known for her voice, but she carries the musical numbers really well. She's delightfully ditzy and nieve. Patrick Dempsey is, of course, handsome and charming, but very funny as the ""straight man"" in this weird scenario.

Perfectly Hilarious,"I was enchanted by Disney's ""Enchanted,"" and I didn't expect to be. This has much to do with the performance of Amy Adams in what could have been a ridiculous role. Instead, she turns it into a very funny modern-day fairy tale in which an evil queen (Susan Sarandon) sends a storybook princess out to contend with a modern New York City, where she meets a handsome lawyer, played by Patrick Dempsey.

"Lacks the adult appeal of classics like  ""The Princess Bride""","Starting off a standard Walt Disney cartoon and then transforming into a live action movie, this is the story of 'true love' and those that would seek to deny it for their own reasons.The one seeking to deny others the chance of true love is the handsome Prince Edward's step-mother, Queen Narissa (voiced and then played by Susan Sarandon). She's a nasty piece of work because she fears losing her title as ""Queen"" if her step-son marries the likely lass that has taken his fancy-Giselle. Hence, by magic the evil step-mother banishes Giselle to non-cartoon New York, in order to separate the would be lovers.My main problem with this movie and the reason I am giving it a low score is that this movie is very much pitched towards children and lacks the cross-over appeal of such great ""G"" rated movies like ""The princess bride"" and ""The Incredibles"" (the former a classic and delightful comedy/fairy-tale, whilst the latter was a cartoon that I saw without great expectations and which impressed me). The latter films provide a reason to have kids!The actress playing/voicing Giselle, along with the other fairytale originating characters, play the live action scenes as if they were in a pantomime. It's a performance pitched at the very youngest of audiences.On the other hand, oddly, you get a very dour and ""realist"" performance by Patrick Dempsey (of the medicated soap ""Grey's Anatomy"", I think)-playing a character who complicates the situation with the would be lovers.At times I felt this movie tending to drag and I found myself cringing at some of the musical numbers (I'm not that into musicals though). However, in the movie's favour, there were a around a handful of laughs to be had. The film does poke fun at the whole ""fairytale"" genre at times.There were a lot children at this screening and whilst they weren't riotously entertained they did enjoy some musical numbers and jokes.For the kiddies.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Modern Enchantment,"Enchanting—a word that will rightfully describe the entire movie. The movie's elements were good, from the cast, visual effects, soundtracks, and production. It brought dreamy fairy tales to modern/50%-possibility-to-happen-in-the-real-world fairy tales.The sensation I felt seeing it for the first time last 2008 was never different every time I watch this movie. It still manages me to sing along to Giselle's songs, to cry in every dramatic scene, to get butterflies in my stomach, to laugh at all madness and to screech with insanity over the evil queen. Not to mention I watched this movie for a couple of times already. Indeed, an enchanting movie that will bring back your love for modernized fairy tales again and again.Magic tricks and spells did not just remain in the pixelated screen but the magic struck and traveled beyond our naked eyes. It struck the..heart. Values and lessons were also manifested. That made it extra fascinating to the audience. But there are also things that I disregard about this movie. Reality checks! It might be modernized fairytale but there are also scenes that are too much to believe in that it could happen in the real world. (Referring to the real world they manifested, not the whole movie itself as fantasy.) They could have made it more natural and real. Following the flow of a real modern day princess' life.But I must say that this movie is one of the most heart warming movie of all time. It embraces all people from all ages. My mother, whose 52, can even belt out some lines of ""How Does She Know."" Thumbs up, Enchanted!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

I think this movie is one of the best movies Disney has put out in quite some time.All the actors and actresses was extremely good and very well suited for their roles (hand picked).I think this movie is made for the whole family and not just for kids !

Utterly enchanting,"Disney is back, in full bloom!A very entertaining and funny family movie, with a story that will engage and amuse both adults and children. This is, of course, a movie about prince charming, but twisted, satirized and modernized. The movie mashes up all the archetypes of Disney fairy-telling and old-glamor musicals and revamps it by using a contemporary script and modern New York settings.The movie departs from a 2D old-Disney-style movie, from where princess Giselle, prince Edward, servant Nathaniel, Hip the chipmunk, and Queen Mother Narissa will jump into New York, with their nonsense talking and schematic stereotypical behavior. In the human world they meet Robert Philip, a single lawyer good-hearted man who doesn't believe in romance or fairy-tales, and his young daughter Morgan, a lonely girl who wants magic in her life.Amy Adams is truly terrific as Giselle, with the innocence, matter of fact behavior, and warmth that you can expect from a fairy-tale book character. Her face is very expressive and makes you believe anything and everything; she's is also great as singer of most of the songs in the movie. In fact, it is thanks to her that the movie is believable and carries on so well.Really great is Timothy Spall in her Woody-Allen-ish Nathaniel, twisted between his love to the queen, his duty as his servant, and his increasing personal worry about self-love. Perfect in their roles are child actor Rachel Covey and Susan Sarandon, whose powerful physique is perfect for her role of witch-queen. Patrick Dempsey plays McDreamy once again, but, Oh well, his role suits McDreamy. The same can be said about a cartoon-ish and very handsome James Marsdem.I loved the musical numbers, so very much in Mary Poppins and Sound of the Music's style. I loved that the different types of animation and special effects -2D, 3D, animal, and book style-, very cute and perfectly integrated in the story. I surprised myself laughing out loud and smiling wholeheartedly during most of the movie, which is the movie's merit.A modern classic from the best possible Disney.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

There were a couple ""adult"" jokes, so to speak, but they were done so tastefully they'd completely go over a kids' head.I am VERY picky about movies (I don't allow ""Shrek"" here because I find the humor too crude and don't want my kids repeating the lines.)

A Nutshell Review: Enchanted,"How does she know, you love her?Probably by bringing her to watch Enchanted, a movie with the words ""chick flick"" rubber stamped all over it. I've got to admit my friend offered to hook me up on a blind date with a hot chick because she wanted to watch this movie, and I had unsuccessfully persuaded him to bring her out on this movie date himself. Anyway if you're reading this, you should, because it has a winning formula!The trailers would have suggested that this was going to be a madcap time, with a Disney movie poking fun at most of its classics, drawing inspiration from, and then taking a mickey out of it. You have a princess-wannabe Giselle (Amy Adams), an animated character modeled quite generically from beauties like Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty et al. Thrown in a Prince Charming named Edward (James Marsden), and his evil stepmother The Queen (Susan Sarandon), with evil hag disguise to boot. And with her greed to hold onto the Kingdom, she prevents the love-at-first-sight/song couple from marrying, and banishes Giselle to The Big Apple.With zero help and all the wrong moves and polite demeanor, she finds herself in the unlikely friendship of Robert Philip (Patrick Dempsey) and his daughter Morgan (Rachel Covey). And here's when the movie starts to come alive with its inane scenes drawn from the Disney archives to bring on the chuckles, down to full blown musical numbers that are just plain charming. If Disney animated movies of yester-years have lovey dovey songs (listen carefully to the background music to spot some recognizable Disney tunes), poisoned apples, dragons, henchmen, magic mirrors (ha!), witches, glass slippers, gorgeous costumes and cute furry animals, this movie has them all. But aside from the predictable elements that make a Disney cartoon a Disney cartoon, it boiled down to what's core in such fairy tales:True Love's Kiss. The one thing that every Disney female character yearn for from their hero. It's a typical fairy tale plot, but in its fish out of water storyline, it offered a clash of two different worldly views on the notion of love. For Giselle, it's always been happily ever afters after a shotgun meeting - boy meets girl, girl loves boy, they get married and live in a huge castle. In the real world we're so familiar with, Robert epitomizes the modern day notions of long drawn courtships, the trying to find out everything you can about the other half, for compatibility reasons, the contemplation whether you can live forever (which is such a long time) with the other half, and the option to divorce always hanging overhead when things don't work out. It's a clash of two different perspective from different worlds, and needless to say opposites do attract, henceforth providing a sort of dilemma as both parties are to be married to their respective partners.Amy Adams is Enchanted, without whom the movie will fall flat. She sings the songs, dances the joyous dance, squeals in delight at every new experience, and is the typical bambi-eyed beauty who finds positivity in everything, even when they are heading south. I guess I'm attracted to optimism, and no doubt, her character of hope had naturally struck a chord in me (same thing goes for Kirsten Dunst's Claire in Cameron Crowe's Elizabethtown). When she opens her mouth and sings to invoke the innate powers of all Disney heroines, the ability to charm animals from afar to do her bidding, you've gotta see this one as it just cracks you up with the type of beings she conjures in New York. In her own ditzy manner, her Giselle will undoubtedly find a soft spot in your heart.Playing her two leading men are Patrick Dempsey as the world-weary divorce lawyer whose pessimism is soon to take an hard knock from Giselle's infectious attitude towards love, and James Marsden as the very himbo-like Prince Edward, all brawn, a naturally glib tongue, and perhaps a hint of an airhead (Is it me, or are female characters these days becoming more Alpha-typed?). Susan Sarandon got top billing too in this movie, and while she looks quite the part as the evil Queen, it's a pity that her screen time had been severely limited, lending more of her voice instead rather than appearing in the flesh. Throwaway characters include Timothy Spall as the no good henchman Nathaniel, and an animated chipmunk Pip (noises by the director Kevin Lima himself in the NY version) which seems to be the precursor to more of the same once Alvin and the Chipmunks hit the screen next month.In true Disney fashion, Enchanted goes back to basics with its message, that there must always be hope that one day you'll meet your true love, whether they drop in from the sky, or crawl out of the sewer. Almost a no-brainer choice for dating couples looking for fluffy chick flick entertainment.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

ENCHANTED lives up to its name!,"Almost everything about the movie is enchanting from its two locations (""happy ever after"" Andalasia vs. ""happy never after"" New York City) to its multi-dimensional characters (campy cartoons vs. reality survivors). Pip, the endearing chipmunk, steals the show in both worlds. Amy Adams, as Giselle the intrepid, out of her element Princess, is a perfect foil for Patrick Dempsey's Robert, the staid and logical NYC lawyer who attempts to help her find her way home. Both have true loves, but their providential meeting alters their perceptions not only of love, but of friends, family, and life in general.The stereotyping of characters, and some continuity errors, were a little disconcerting. Yet the metamorphosis of those characters into believable people, and the engaging storyline, eradicated all of these concerns.If you love fairy tales with inevitable happy endings, see this movie. ENCHANTED is a movie in which almost everyone finds his or her true heart's desire, which could be exasperating for cynics, anyone who has no interest in romantic love, and those who abhor show stopping musical numbers.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

The title says it all,"The title says it all really, and after seeing this enchanting fairy-tale you may feel enchanted yourself. Essentially, it's a chick-flick for little girls but so winning is Bill Kelly's script, so polished the direction of Kevin Lima and so completely engaging the performances of just about everybody that the film transcends all genre conventions. This is the year's smartest, sweetest comedy. (I can't think of a more affectionate parody; little girls will love it, for sure, but then so will their parents).It begins in a cartoon wonderland straight out of ""Snow White"" and ""The Sleeping Beauty"" but this one has an ogre, (Shrek has a lot to answer for), and a heroine who's whiter than snow. There is also a handsome prince who is clearly in love with himself, (when asked if he likes himself he replies, 'What's there not to like?'), and a wicked queen voiced, and finally brought to life, superbly, by Susan Sarandon. The film takes off when Sarandon banishes our heroine, Giselle, to present day New York, ('where there are no happy endings'), and she materializes in the form of Amy Adams who is the kookiest and most lovable klutz the movies have given us in quite a while. The only mystery is why no Oscar nomination? Of course, in New York she meets her own Prince Charming in the shape of handsome divorce lawyer Patrick Dempsey but before the inevitable happy ending they have to contend with poison apples, an old hag, (Sarandon, naturally), and a dragon, (Sarandon again). I suppose you could call it post-modern but that might put you off. (We aren't talking Bruno Bettleheim here; this isn't ""Into the Woods""). Best you just go with an open mind or better still, with an open heart. This is one movie that really is magical.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
What a complete waste.... of Idina Menzel,"Seriously. The references and cameos are adorable please do not get me wrong. I chuckled at a lot of the ""fish out of water"" moments. I could watch this with children and friends and find it perfectly acceptable. Even better was having honest moments with Giselle and Morgan which were real life lessons in the midst of the fairy tale. Bonus, having the ""damsel in distress"" switch was a nice pay off in the end but having someone like Idina Menzel who is more than amazing not sing once is a terrible waste of a movie. True she went onto Frozen and most likely will be bigger and better but the surprise in finding her in this movie is tainted by the pure wastefulness of her even being it. Almost anyone could've played her part and the the worst thing.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
The commercials do this movie no justice.,"From the commercials, ""Enchanted"" looked like a typical, run of the mill family film. They show a princess coming into New York with hip hop music playing, and make it look like the movie is filled with jokes involving the princess mistaking people for Disney characters, and the princess singing and doing embarrassing things in public, in which she is told to stop. It's not like that at all. When (soon to be) Princess Giselle sings, New York starts singing with her. She's bringing her fantastical world to New York more than New York quieting her down.After Giselle (Amy Adams) is saved by Prince Edward (James Marsden) from a troll, they are to be married. But Edward's wicked stepmother (Susan Sarandon) does not approve and throws Giselle into a seemingly bottomless well that leads straight to real life New York. Giselle meets Robert (Patrick Dempsey), a single working father, and learns about the real world, and gives the real world a reason to sing. Meanwhile, more cartoon characters go through the portal, and chaos ensues. One thing that really surprised me about ""Enchanted"" was that there was no contemporary music. From the advertisements, it looked like there would be hip hop and rap to portray New York, but all the music in the film was created for the film, including a few new songs, by the wonderful Alan Menken (Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, etc.) The whole movie was really cute and sweet, but managed to not go overboard and how corny it was, which is often hard with kid's movies. The acting was good, as was the singing, and it was nice to see some traditional Disney animation, which hasn't been seen theatrically since 2004's ""Home on the Range"".Overall, this was a well put together, fun movie, with a fantastic musical score. I thinks kids and adults alike will enjoy this one.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 100 mins. PG for mild violence.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Enchanted is a nice parody/tribute to fairy tales from Walt Disney Pictures,"Walt Disney Pictures' original animated/live-action musical comedy Enchanted is a mostly wonderful tribute/parody of various fairy tale films that made the company the most enchanting for family entertainment. Amy Adams is simply luminous as Giselle, the maiden who finds herself caught between James Marsden's Prince Edward from her animated life and Patrick Dempsey's Robert Phillip in the real New York one. Also featuring Susan Sarandon as the evil Queen Narissa and Timothy Spall as Nathaniel, her henchman. Then there's the chipmunk Pip, voiced by Jeff Bennett in Andalasia and the director Kevin Lima in New York when Pip can only communicate in chipmunk sounds. Finally, there's Idina Menzel as Robert's fiancée, Nancy, and six-year-old Rachel Covey as his daughter, Morgan. All players I've mentioned contribute wonderfully to this movie that lives up to its title. My favorite sequences, however, both involve Giselle when she sings her heart out in New York. The first involves when she calls to some animals to help clean Robert's apartment when he's gone and many of them are rats and roaches! Then at Central Park when she starts singing to Robert about finding true love, he at first tells her to just keep walking then she encounters some Calypso musicians and they start joining in and then just everyone within walking distance do the same. Well, except Robert who insists he can't sing or dance! The songs by Disney veterans Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz move along at a breezy pace. Also nice to see previous animated Disney princesses Jodi Benson (Ariel), Paige O'Hara (Belle), and Judy Kuhn (Pocohantas) make cameo appearances and to hear Julie Andrews herself narrate. All in all, Enchanted is another Disney movie that should be entertaining enough for all ages who want that feel-good happy ending with some clever satire that makes, in the words of Andrews' Mary Poppins character from that Disney picture, ""the medicine go down"".",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney Making Fun of Itself,"This is by far, the most I've ever laughed at a Disney movie. I think most of the jokes went over the young kids' heads. However, the adults in the audience could not stop laughing. Amy Adams plays a perfect Disney princess. She is flawless as the doe-eyed, naive, love - will - conquer -all optimist. Snow White or Cinderella would not have done better themselves. The work song scene was hysterical as well as the Central Park chorus scene. The theater applauded several times during the movie. I don't think I've ever witnessed this phenomenon. Of course, the ending was predictable and a little cheesy but I think it suited the plot. It wouldn't be a Disney movie if it had a surprise ending. The only thing I found missing was a Susan Serandon song. We all know she can do it, remember Rocky Horror? That is a missed opportunity for more laughs if you ask me.

Mistake,"Outstanding film, and Amy Adams was perfect. The songs she sang were incredible.The horrible song by Underwood that ended the film nearly ruined my experience, however. Why couldn't they have given Amy another fantastic, memorable song to sing, instead of some awful country-pop song?One huge mistake: at the ball, the ""King's Waltz"" is not a waltz at all. How could these obviously talented composers have made such a boner? About halfway through, they play a bunch of eighth notes in groups of three, probably in 12/8 time, to sort of make it sound like a waltz, but we're not fooled! It sounded like a two step, and the dancers were all dancing two step dances, so it obviously wasn't enough of a waltz to dance a waltz to!!

Probably the year's most enchanting romantic comedy...,"What the world really needs in 2007 are more films with the ageless charm and wit of ENCHANTED. It's priceless entertainment from the Disney studios, providing plenty of chuckles and downright laughter as PATRICK DEMPSEY, AMY ADAMS, JAMES MARSDEN and SUSAN SARANDON go through the paces of their fairy-tale roles. What helps immeasurably is that the witty script has been given a sumptuous look in both the animated and real-life scenes and the musical score is fresh and appropriate, if not a bit familiar in that it seems to be borrowing heavily from other Disney films--most of the time intentionally so.The script has the animated Giselle, a princess, being banished from the palace when her beauty surpasses that of Queen Narissa (SUSAN SARANDON). She exiles her to an existence in hell--make that New York City. Once in the city, after climbing out of a manhole cover in full princess regalia, the lovely princess (AMY ADAMS in a cheerfully over the top performance), runs into all sorts of predicaments because she acts like someone who ""just escaped from a Hallmark card"", according to the lawyer (PATRICK DEMPSEY) who gives her shelter for the night but soon finds himself forming a romantic attachment to her.It moves along at a brisk pace, is stunning to watch because the hand drawn animation is so beautifully rendered, and is fun all the way, with everyone giving their own brand of exuberance to the acting.SUSAN SARANDON is extremely effective as The Wicked Queen and her make-up as the old hag deserves an Oscar. JAMES MARSDEN has all the physical requirements for his role as Prince Edward and tops that with a performance modeled after the vain Gaston from ""Beauty and the Beast"".There's no shortage of romantic chemistry between PATRICK DEMPSEY and AMY ADAMS in the leads, evident from their first awkward encounter to the final fadeout.Too bad Hollywood isn't capable of churning out more films like this one, as solid a romantic fantasy as anyone could wish for with lots of sly fun at the expense of other Disney classics and enough old-fashioned charm to satisfy adults and children.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fantastic movie to watch,"Enchanted is without a doubt a charming film. Gisele is an extremely adorable and kind hearted person which makes it very easy to like her. The supporting characters all serve their purpose very well and have pretty solid performances. The music is great, the comedy is spot on, and the costume designs are incredible. Even the references to previous Disney stories are awesome. Overall, a great movie to watch with or without family and friends. Amy Adams stars as Giselle, a
stereotyped Disney princess, who is exiled to the real world New York City by an evil queen. Amy Adams is fantastic in the lead role and steals the show from everyone else, she truly is a Disney princess. Most of the music by Alan Menkin is great, ""That's How You Know"" is a personal favorite. The songs in the later half of the film devolve into pop sounding drivel that date the movie. There are countless references in this film to other Disney movies that make this film re-watchable. Highly recommended movie, go check it out!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"If you like classic Disney animation, this is for you!","I saw this film tonight, and I have to admit, I totally loved it! Disney finally made a good movie, the first in several years. It is a loving tribute to the classic animated Disney movies, particularly the ones made from 1937-1959 and 1989-1999. If you are a big fan of those movies, you will love pointing out the little references they made to those films here (a pizzeria is called the ""Bella Notte Restaurant,"" Robert Phillip's ball outfit resembling the Beast's suit) The animation seen at the beginning and the end, though it was obviously outsourced, was very good. It looked like classic Disney at its best! The whole plot with Giselle and Edward not understanding the harsh reality of modern New York City actually made for an interesting plot. My favorite part was when Giselle sang out the apartment window and attracted the pigeons, cockroaches, rats and other NYC pest animals to help tidy up the house ala ""Snow White!"" The chipmunk was rather amusing when he was in the real world, with his unintelligible high-pitched ""real world"" voice and pantomime. Overall, I highly recommend this film if you absolutely love the great animated Walt Disney Classics!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Out of this WORLD!!!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie; it's funny, romantic and full of catchy music which you can't help singing to, when you walk through the cinema doors.Although the ending was a little predictable, i still thought it was the best part of the movie. Many people may think that Enchanted is weird or boring, but i think t was a Disney movie with a twist! I loved Pip and his character imitations and the character Giselle and her true love kiss dream. She was greatly entertaining with her funny remarks and her lack of understanding the real world.This film is a fantastic and adorable fantasy which should be seen to anyone who loves Disney!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Enchantless?,"Not really for the adults! A mix of animation and live action. An unconvincing prince and, typical these days, a flawed hero!.

The best movie of the last 5 years!,"I'm a church pastor and my wife and I looked forward to seeing this movie when it came out and were not disappointed.

I loved the soundtrack so much my wife bought it and placed it on my computer. ""How Does He Know"" should win the Oscar for best song!I am so in love with this movie, I plan on taking my entire church congregation to see it. This movie should serve as a reminder to other movie makers that this is why we have movies, to entertain, love, laugh and inspire.

This was the third smash hit of 2007 which I first saw in 2010 and found to be immensely overrated!,"This 2007 Disney blockbuster, a parody and homage to the Disney fairy tale movies, definitely turned out to be a hit, so even though I didn't see it when it was in theatres, it wasn't long before I knew about it. I remember several songs from it being nominated for Best Original Song at the Oscars in 2008, but I was glad when they all lost to ""Falling Slowly"" from ""Once"". I never actually saw ""Enchanted"" until just a few months ago. This was after I watched ""Juno"" and ""Superbad"", two other very popular films from 2007, and found them both to be very overrated indeed! Even though this movie is nothing like either of those two, I ended up thinking this was another vastly overrated blockbuster from the same year. Trying it a second time several months after my first viewing unfortunately didn't seem to change anything.Giselle lives in a cartoon fairy tale world called Andalasia, where there is always a ""happily ever after."" This is also a world where animals talk and inhabitants often break into song. Her true love turns out to be Prince Edward, who saves her from a troll, so the two of them will soon be married, and Giselle will become a princess. However, Prince Edward's stepmother, the evil Queen Narissa, knows that this marriage will remove her from the throne, so she sends Giselle through a portal to a world where there are no ""happily ever afters!"" This world is the real world, where Giselle finds herself in modern-day New York City! Obviously confused by her surroundings, the young fairy tale woman is soon found by a divorce lawyer named Robert Philip, who comes to her aid. He takes her back to his apartment, but even though she means no harm, she is bound to cause some trouble in Robert's life. Meanwhile, Prince Edward goes to the real world to search for Giselle, and Pip the chipmunk comes along. Queen Narissa sends her servant, Nathaniel, to try and trick Giselle into taking a bite out of a poisonous apple! Pip learns the real reason why Nathaniel has come to the real world and tries to warn the prince, but unfortunately, in this world, chipmunks can't talk!The lead character here is played by Amy Adams, and both times I saw this film, I realized that this character's cutesy fairy tale demeanor is supposed to be part of the humour here, but I was put off by it. In fact, I didn't really care much for any of the characters. The film is a comedy, but I hardly found anything funny at all, and I think the characters had a lot to do with this, Giselle case in point. The many gags which I found unfunny include Pip defecating in fright at one point, which I wasn't expecting the first time and thought was pretty gross! The idea of fairy tale characters in the real, modern world is an interesting one, but what this causes in this comedy fantasy wasn't usually that amusing to me. I did hear several songs from the film performed at the Academy Awards, but couldn't remember exactly what I thought of them at the time. However, after actually watching the movie and hearing those Oscar-nominated songs again, I would say the songs here are another weak aspect of this 2007 Disney blockbuster, and they have made me appreciate ""Falling Slowly"" more, even though that is a totally different kind of song from a totally different kind of film.Of the three movies of 2007 which I later saw and didn't even come close to getting the hype for, this one is by far the most different of the three (unlike the other two, this one is a family fantasy film and has nothing to do with teenhood), and the only one without Michael Cera, but regardless of significant genre differences, my opinion still stands. I didn't review ""Enchanted"" after my first viewing, since I had just watched ""Superbad"" and written my bad review of it, and I guess something about doing the same with this film immediately after that one didn't feel right. Even though it didn't seem like this parody/homage to the Disney fairy tale movies would likely improve for me, I gave it another chance several months later, and this time, I intended to review the movie regardless of what I thought of it. Unsurprisingly, I still don't have many positive things to say about it, other than the stunning visual effects towards the end, and I most certainly don't intend to watch it a third time for ANY reason. No matter how well received a film is, it can't impress EVERYBODY who sees it, and I respect other people's opinions, but cannot imagine myself ever agreeing with this movie's reputation.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
somewhat confused by some ratings,"Ye gads! Some people must have seen a different movie than I did. I found Enchanted to be a great deal of fun, the music captivating, the actors sublime....yet a number of voters chose to rate it a 1. It's understandable that someone may not have loved it as much as I did but to rate it that poorly? All I can say is that if you are trying to decide if you want to see this movie, you are in for a treat. The movie pokes gentle fun at the princess looking for her prince while a man who has been wounded in love is willing to settle for steady and stable. Of course they find that things are not always as they seem on the surface. The blending of animation and live action with a wink to setting the animated characters in reality was perfect due in part to the excellent casting. Kudos to all who made this work so well.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Meh,"I watched ""Enchanted"" on TV for the first time today and I feel ambivalent toward it. I'm not a big fan of fairy tales and Disney films and I'm clearly not the target audience, but I do watch such things from time to time. The positives are that the film is well made and looks good, with an attractive cast performing with gusto, some are almost worrisomely wide-eyed though. And the story is a decent mish mash of previous Disney films and tales such as Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty. I rate ""Enchanted"" a 4/10 though because I just wasn't that invested in it. I found the chipmunk annoying, a lot of the humor unfunny, and some of the sentiment cloying. I preferred the film ""Snow White and the Three Stooges"" which has a similar plot without the modern setting. I also disliked the end of ""Enchanted"" where the couples switch pairings and the one pair goes back into fairy land; I'm concerned about the messages that sends to youngsters. I also found the cockroaches, rats, and pigeons cleaning the apartment to be too much to accept. I know suspension of disbelief and all, but come on, they'd trash the place, not clean it, and they're just gross, worst part of the film.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

Believe me, there is always someone out there for everyone, so if you watch this film you'll realize that you shouldn't give up hope if you don't find love. Instead, let love find you at the right place, right time, right moment and with the right person.

Charming Marriage of Classic and Classless,"A perfect marriage of Walt Disney nostalgia, and the ""real"" modern world that we're more accustomed to. Gisele, a fair maiden living in a clichéd cartoon world where her best friends are a slew of woodland creatures who help her clean and get dressed, and sing in harmony while she sings of her dreams to kiss her Prince Charming she has yet to meet. By the end of the catchy but diddy she's met that man a stereotypical, handsome, self assured pretty boy, Prince Edward. After just meeting in cartoon fashion they are to be married the next day, but Edward's stepmother objects, because she will lose her throne if her son should marry. So she disguises her self as a familiar witch with an affinity for poisoned apples and pushes Gisele down a wishing well sending her in a whirlwind, in to the New York sewers. A realist single dad about to get engaged, divorce lawyer soon finds himself aiding her, and trying to make some sense of her outlandish outfit and attitudes about true love's kiss, rats, and dress making, but before he knows it she's shown him that maybe their worlds aren't as different as he thinks. Adams is incredibly sweet and enchanting as Gisele. From cartoon to New York City streets, she is an absolute embodiment of a fairy tale princess right in front of our eyes. James Marsden is also right out of a Walt Disney classic with his charming, ego-centric, swagger as the prince of every little girl's dreams. Patrick Dempsey might be slightly miscast in the role of the realist lawyer, but it doesn't hurt the film any. The singing is pitch perfect to match the great songs. It'll blow you away to find Amy Adams does her own singing.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

the best movie for romance,"I really have to say this is one of the best movies I ever seen with a mixed up fairytale and the truth of romance. I also could say it's one of the best movies I've seen this year but I was not very joyed that there was a bit too much of talking through out the film and yet the prince in tights should of anyway married the princess he wanted. I liked most of the humor of the film especially with the prince in tights, the chipmunk and the of course the bride. the ending however was a bit silly due to the evil queen dying to easily and the princess that prince Edward married in the end brought her phone to the animated world. there was always a strong message in the film that you have let the person you are falling in love with let them know you actually love that person. This is almost my second favorite movie of the year and hopefully there will be more of these fine romance movies coming out soon. 10/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
I loved this movie!,"I went to see this last night in my local little cinema. It has proved me right again not having any expectation before seeing the film proves that you can be really surprised. I loved everything about this film. This is not a musical but has some singing in it and I usually hate that, but it was just hilarious how it was done. The idea of the Giselle acting like a Disney princess in New York was just so funny. I really embarrassed myself laughing out loud, glad there was only 8 other people in the cinema. Im not really a romantic either but this film was so romantic i fell for it and prayed that they got together at the end. The animals were cute, the story was sweet and it all worked beautifully.

Fell in love with Prince Edward.,"I'm going to agree with the average vote. This all new Disney movie was such a good idea that that I knew something would go wrong.

I liked it because it doesn't take anything seriously, it's just fun. Amy Adams did a fantastic job as lost Disney princess taken from her cartoon, stereotype world and dumped into fast moving new York city by her true love's cruel step mother. James Marsden is hilarious as charming Prince Andrew desperate to win Giselle's heart and rescue her from....anything.

Women already in love with Patrick Dempsey aren't disappointed in his appearance either. Not only him but Amy Adams was fantastic, as well as the little girl that played Robert's daughter (pardon me for not recalling her name). The music was of course fantastic. I found myself spending countless ours downloading the beautiful songs featured in this film. At 15 years old I already know that I will be buying this film to share with my children as I grow older.

Thank GOODNESS this came along!!! Get lost Shrek!,"Well what can I say? It was so nice to see a fairytale again (a recent cinematic one I mean)! I went to see ""Enchanted"" at the Odeon Cinema in Hereford and it was just spectacular! It was such a gripping, outstanding concept for a cartoon Fairytale land and the real world to furiously collide (with the help of amazing trick photography). I saw it with my family to see it this afternoon after we had all made up from a row that was just SCOLDING and do you know what? It cheered up all of us not just through the cool comedy but just by looking at ""Enchanted"" - it is beautiful! I was so pleased that for once in this modern spunky era they used cartoons rather than CGI; they are filled with so much more dedication! ""Enchanted"" provides us with a fantastical insight on just how different those two worlds are! Giselle is banished from her home and doesn't know how to live life as a proper human being or how to behave in societies such as New York City. But that's not the only thing Giselle is faced with - she also must choose between two men who are both simply adorable; a price or a New York citizen (with a small 6-year-old child). Although the end was quite dramatic and it may not agree with young children, I, being 17, didn't find it at all scary but full of effective adventure so, for me at least, it was increasingly exciting! It was certified PG but I think the classification U would've suited this spellbinding movie better! I recommend it to families everywhere!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Cracking family entertainment.,"Disney's Enchanted is a wonderful film: not only does it have a brilliantly simple, yet completely ingenious concept, that is packed full of great jokes, romance, adventure, and hugely enjoyable musical numbers, but it also makes a star of the beautiful and talented Amy Adams, who, if there is any justice in this world, will have a long and successful career ahead of her.As Giselle, the fairytale princess-to-be who is sent to New York by the evil Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon), Adams is absolutely perfect: heart-achingly attractive with an angel's voice. Who can really blame single father Robert Philip (played by Patrick Dempsey) for falling for her charms, even though he is about to propose to his long term girlfriend? Not I.Robert, an attorney, meets Giselle as she wanders the streets of the 'Big Apple', struggling to cope with the harsh reality of the city. After taking the confused young woman back to his apartment (which he shares with his six-year-old daughter), his life becomes completely turned upside-down: his girlfriend leaves him (fair enoughshe sees Giselle laying on top of him in nothing but a towel!), and his career looks decidedly shaky (once again, Giselle does not seem to help the situation).Also throwing a spanner in the works are several others characters from the fairy tale realm, who have followed Giselle to New York: Prince Edward, who wishes to marry the pretty maiden, having spent a whole day in her company; Giselle's best friend Pip (who happens to be a chipmunk!); and the loathsome Nathaniel (Timothey Spall), Queen Narissa's right hand man, who is determined that Edward will not find his true love.With Enchanted, director Kevin Lima proves himself to be a name to watch, providing his audience with brilliant wall-to-wall family fun, and delivering a couple of scenes that are instant Disney classics: Giselle summoning the vermin of New York to help her tidy Robert's apartment; and the song and dance routine in which everyone joins in, having obviously been affected by a little of Giselle's fairytale magic.Of course, despite the villains' best attempts, everything ends happily ever after (as do all great fairy tales), but not before Giselle learns that falling in love means getting to know someone properly first, Robert learns to trust his feelings, Nathaniel realises the error of his ways, the nasty Narissa is defeated by a brave rodent, and Edward finds someone who is truly grateful to be whisked off their feet by a handsome prince.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Enchanted,"This is a comedy and love story that A princess from the animated fairy tale suddenly appears to NY and runs a risk to experience the actual world with her pleasant friends.

Next is a beautiful and luxurious costumes of the princess. Girls and Women are fascinated by them and they could feel as if they were a princess. Third, Enchanted is a funny story. That is essential to Disney films, so all people watching it can enjoy. Enchanted generously gives people dream, therefore I love this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Amy Adams shines totally!!,"Disney's Production is always a guaranty for quality. That fairy atmosphere, music with childish spirit. It is really a wonderful experience watching this film. I kept telling myself in the watching that I am enjoying a cheerful film.Amy Adams sparkles. Her appearance is so sunny. All three of her dresses are masterpiece, elegant, pretty and unique. Without those fairy songs, Giselle would lose at least half of her charm. But it fortunately isn't the truth! The musical pieces are carefully written, they reminds me of another Disney's production: The parent trap, also having first-class music. Although Amy couldn't sing ""in situ""(obviously she acted soundless in scenes and her song voice was post-added.), but it doesn't burden that much. I can still lose myself deeply in her musical world.By the way, the little Morgen Rachel also wins her own credit. Such a sweet girl (if I am allowed to say, twice so sweet as Giselle).Finally, the whole film is an unforgettable sensation. I am always looking forward Disney's works.

An excellent dream come true,"Enchanted: A Fairytale Brought to Life With its ten year anniversary just around the corner, Enchanted continues to spark the imagination of children and parents alike. This movie is able to create a bridge between fantasy and reality, connecting them in a way that reconfigures previous fairy tales. Not only is this film a classic for the whole family, it's also a wonderland full of fruit for the imagination.Amy Adams, who portrays Giselle, does a phenomenal job of portraying an animated character brought to life. She comes from an animated fairytale world where she is living a fantasy, and she carries that mindset through her transition to New York City. Her emotions lead you on this journey of experiencing life for what seems to be the first time. She is able to separate her character into two different identities and then ties them together in the end. Patrick Dempsey, who portrays Robert Phillip, is the charming knight in shiny armor that comes to rescue Gisele from the streets of New York in the beginning of the movie. He is able to captivate the reality of a hero, beyond the glorified fairytale version. Together Adams and Dempsey create a platform in which they continue to build up and the whole time they are drawing in the audience with their chemistry and emotional connection.The music is what bring the movie to life. It's playful and entertaining while telling an important story. The songs mostly speak of love and the person you're meant to be with for the rest of your life, very fitting for a fairytale. The meaning of the lyrics progress from fairytale to reality as the movie continues. Starting with dreaming of a true loves kiss all the way to loving someone you can't have. It's a powerful progression which enhances how the audience feels, how I felt. Adams does an excellent job singing and performing with great vocals and exceptional dance moves. The performance of ""That's how you know"" is a joyful one which brings all the people of New York together to sing about love and telling the girl of your dreams how you feel. It's exciting and by the end of the song you'll be trying to sing along.Another element which progresses throughout the movie is Giselle's costume designs. They begin as poufy, cliché fairytale ball gowns and slowly slim down into an end product of a tightly fitted, mermaid style gown. These dresses directly tie into the different stages of Giselle's journey to reality and greatly highlights that. They were bright and elegant and made Giselle the center of attention at all times.Enchanted is a must-see movie with a charming spin on a classic fairytale, making it into something people can relate to. This is not only impressive but captivating. The emotional and joyous acting of Adams and Dempsey, the reconfigured classic fairytale plot, stunning outfits and the perfect music all come together to evoke the idea that fairy tales really do come true. It leaves the audience with hope that they could one day walk alongside a princess on the streets of New York.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

The movie contains a lot of resemblance with lots of Disney movies, ranging from Snow White to Cinderella and all in between. Not to mention that the star in the movie looks like an actual Disney cartoon.The music is addictive, the jokes are to be liked by both kids and adults and the atmosphere is just great. I can't imagine anyone not liking this film and not being happy when the end title appears. I felt like a little girl when I got out of the cinema, and I know a lot of girls there felt the same way.Plus, Patrick Dempsey plays a great character rather then being total eye-candy (which he is, but that's not his role) like in G.A.So please, go and watch this movie.

I loved this movie,"I thought this movie was great! I loved the entire thing, but then again, I love musicals. I like the fact that it explains why Giselle just bursts out singing in the middle of Central Park (because she's from a place where people do that), instead of most musicals where people just sing with no reason. On top of that, I love the actors in this movie (although I will never see Timothy Spall as anyone but Peter Pettigrew from Harry Potter). I think it was casted perfectly. James Marsden is perfect playing a goofy character, and there's not a line Price Edward says that you don't want to laugh at. All in all, I enjoyed this movie and plan on buying it when it comes out to video. My advice, go see something before you put it off. This is no ordinary Disney movie!!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very enchanted.,"There are few films which can make you squirm and wriggle with delight as you watch them. This is one of them.It has many good film qualities. Both cartoon AND CGI animation, wonderful filming, the portrayal of a fairytale as ridiculous, the idea of the film is simply brilliant, the characters inspiring, the songs good, many laughs - and the list is just about endless! This film is simply enchanted (as you may have worked out from the title).Starting as a cartoon fairy story, a prince, the son of an evil queen who does not want anyone to take over her throne, rides into the forest to hunt for trolls and hears a beautiful voice in the forest. He finds a young girl and immediately decides to marry her the next day. Before they marry, an old crone takes the girl (who is Giselle) to a well and tells Giselle to wish for whatever she wants. The well is very large and deep and while she is on the very edge, the old crone pushes her and she falls down, down, until she finds herself in New York!Good for fairy-tale lovers of any age and for people who also like to have laughs in Disney princess films, this is the film for you.Enjoy ""Enchanted""! :-)",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great movie full of Disney's magic,"I thought that Disney would have already lost its ability to make those great movies like Beauty and the Beast and the Little Mermaid for example. But Enchanted proved that I was wrong.Enchanted really brought something new. What would happen to fairy tale princess in our real world? I think story was really great and it was interesting to see what will happen to Giselle. Enchanted is really good movie for whole family and I'm certain that people of every age will enjoy watching this.Cast is great and I really think that this movie is Oscar worthy. And Alan Menken has made great job like always and I just love songs in the movie!And since I usually cry in end of every movie (well not always), I would probably cried in end of this movie too, but I'm too shy to cry in the cinema. And reason I would have cried, is because I could feel the same great magical feeling in this movie as I have felt in those old Disney movies that I haven't feel for ages. That made my feel very happy and brought some nice childhood memories.Altogether Enchanted was best movie of 2007. It was funny, music was fantastic and I'm definitely happy about that Disney hasn't lost its magic yet!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hugely Entertaining Fantasy with Love Lessons for All of Us,"I have another movie to recommend; it's title, Enchanted, describes how I felt about it.When I entered the theater, I thought I made a mistake. This was a Disney movie, and many in the audience were kids. The opening scenes further reinforced my mistake, since all I saw were animated, cartoon characters.But 10 minutes later, a dramatic turn takes place. The cartoon princess-to-be has her storybook romance with Prince Charming (the animated kind) derailed as she's catapulted into New York's Times Square, where she emerges from a manhole and is surrounded by real people. Much later, Prince Charming leaves Fantasyland and comes to New York to claim his bride. Are you still with me? This being a romantic comedy, here's where the complications come in.Before the Prince arrives in New York, Princess Giselle (Amy Adams) has met a handsome, engaged lawyer (Patrick Dempsey) with an adorable six-year old daughter. Add the lawyer's girlfriend to the mix, and you have your basic story. Let it develop at its own pace, and don't prejudge its uniqueness. I urge you to accept the fantasy premise of animated characters and humans interacting, and just follow the enchanting and refreshing story. (The last films I saw involving human-cartoon interaction were the 1988 Who Framed Roger Rabbit? and last year's Pan's Labyrinth, award winners in several categories.) This is a great ""date movie,"" since all aspects of relationships are discussed: commitment, dating, fidelity, jealousy, infatuation, serendipity, accepting imperfections, and even questioning if Prince Charming is indeed the best candidate for ""happily ever after."" What stands out most is dialog about relationships and what's meaningful.One would need to be hard-hearted not to appreciate fantasy Princess Giselle, who is described as a ""Hallmark Card brought to life,"" and her gallant Prince Charming (James Marsden), who is no shoo-in to win her heart. Guys can be reassured that if even Prince Charming has romantic barriers to surmount, it's even harder for us. Women might recognize that someone other than that Prince may be a better choice.As the story unfolds, the characters switch roles; animated ones develop human qualities, and vice-versa. All four protagonists, or five counting the six-year old, are likable. Trust me on this one. Don't be afraid to shed a tear. This movie has been #1 at the box-office, and received great reviews.Enchanted features many other audience-pleasing elements like special effects, a Cinderella scene, villains, two songs, waltz dancing at a Ball, elaborate costumes, a King-Kong like rescue from a skyscraper and wonderful scenes from New York City's Central Park, the new Time-Warner Complex and Times Square. There's also a surprise ending.The best-known cast member is Susan Sarandon, playing the mother witch of the Prince. However, the cast is well suited for their parts. See the film, and give me your feedback.I did not make a mistake in seeing this after all. It's more than a kid's film, despite the Disney animation. And shouldn't all romances include some stardust?",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great fun,"As someone who was a young girl during the heyday of ""The Little Mermaid"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", and ""Aladdin"", I have a soft spot for the type of movie that the beginning of ""Enchanted"" looks like. As someone who grew from a young girl to an adult watching the likes of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" (the TV show, not the movie) and reading ""Wicked"", I also have a soft spot for movies, books, whatever that are willing to change the formula. So it's only natural that I really enjoyed ""Enchanted"".The story is a smart one that plays on fairy tale archetypes, showing how dusty some of them are, like the whole meeting and marrying in what seems like a day to live happily ever. It also shows how life might be a little better if we took some lessons from the fairy tales when it comes to love, at least in our declarations of it.Some have been unhappy with the story that Narissa (Susan Sarandon) has, but there's only so much film that can be made and since this is a movie for children, there has to be something that's black and white.The performance that sticks out the most is Amy Adams. Every note is pitch perfect. She never plays Giselle with a knowing wink to the audience. She IS a princess come to life, until she's been in the world enough to move into that 3rd dimension character-wise.Overall, an enjoyable movie for everyone, well except for young boys who don't like princess-y stuff.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Simply been enchanted by Enchanted!,"I had gone to a local theater looking to see the movie August Rush. When my mom and I got there,it wasn't playing. So I thought, well I guess we should see this Enchanted movie. I saw the commercials and I thought it would be pretty good. I walked out of the theater that night singing and saying quotes from the movie. Enchanted simply just enchanted me. I bought the movie the day it came out on DVD. I have watched everyday since then while doing homework and such. Even if I'm not paying attention or actually watching it, I find myself saying all the lines of the characters without even thinking! This movie has by far been my favorite movie ever! Amy Adams does a magnificent job portraying the positive and innocent character of Giselle. I even bought the soundtrack! I sing along with Amy and James everyday! Enchanted is a great comedy and a brilliant romance that is appropriate for ALL ages!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Simply excellent,"What can I say about this movie other than - see it! The lead actress, Amy Adams, is wonderful in every aspect of her performance, and is expertly supported by all other actors - no one fails to deliver in this movie. Even the chipmunk is some of the best and funniest work I have ever seen - and had the entire theatre in hysterics! The movie has genuine heart, and never once does it fall into the crassness often associated with a parody - in fact, Enchanted should not even be classified as a parody of old Disney movies. It is a breath of fresh air which has something for all ages, both male and female. The only minor issue for me was to do with the ending which gave the impression that the writers felt as if they needed to give symbolism for Giselle having changed her ways (by giving her a very plain, and disappointing, balldress and hairstyle to the ball) - I felt as if the audience was letdown by not seeing Giselle in an absolutely breathtaking ballgown. At any rate, the film deserves a full 10/10 and has countless moments you will want to see over and over again!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great family movie,"We really enjoyed this movie. My 14 year old daughter and 11 year old son went and really liked it. The music was upbeat and catchy. I highly recommend the movie for all ages. It is squeaky clean, so even very young children will enjoy this. Good movie if you want a stronger female lead in a Disney movie without being a damsel in distress. Patrick Dempsey did a great job and Amy Adams is pretty good at looking surprised all the time by her new surroundings. We liked when the stepmother came into the movie. The effects near the end were pretty good without being scary. Hope you get a chance to see the movie this holiday season. We are definitely going to get this on DVD.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
The rebirth of the old-time greatness,"I've never been so excited because of a movie. I registered an IMDb account just to write a review for a movie, something I've never done before and I've also never thought I would do for anything other than video games !!!(I'm kind of a hardcore gamer). But ""Enchanted"" really stands out from all movie I have enjoyed. It has been really a long time that there is such an intriguing film come out to market.Enchanted is a masterpiece in every aspects, especially presentation. The visual and the music are both terrific, they blend so perfectly, so naturally, so fantastic that can suck everyone into the world of fairy tale unconsciously. Enchanted reminds everyone that when talking about fairy-tale, Walt Disney is king !! As a fairy-tale based movie, it is understandable that Enchanted plot is predictable, but surprisingly the plot is very entertaining and doesn't make you bored for even one minute.What about the cast? One word: flawless !!! I'm not exaggerating it.If you think that you're too old for fairytale, think again. I never imagine I would enjoy a fairy-tale style movie, but I fall in love with Enchanted, and I know it will be very long before another film could steal my love :)",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
I expected charming and witty I got clever as a bonus,"I got more than I expected. I went to see a charming fantasy with some promising cast members and one or two nice trailers. It started slow, witty from the start but very little emotional involvement, I was impressed with how nicely Amy Adams was portraying a cartoon but how emotionally involved can you get with a cartoon character. I was even more impress with her transition into flesh and blood and the growth of character she was showing during a rather short movie. All the cast was doing well not everybody had such a demanding role and Susan Sarandon can complain about lack of screen time even though she gets a blast from her part and it showed. But I most enjoyed the way this movie was commenting about the relations between cinema, fairy tales and real life. I can't demonstrate how well it was done without adding spoilers so you'll simply have to take my word on the subject. You may take a look at the trivia section of this internet page but all those may seem like plain movie buff jokes unless you really go and see how it all makes sense as a statement about cinema as the modern Brothers Grimm. And the movie does it without being openly philosophical, it's all done in a subtle manner in the subtext. It was more than I expected but I'm always ready to get such ""disappointments"".",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fun movie that treads a fine line between embracing and mocking Disney princesses,"This is a very enjoyable movie, with some great laughs (the scene with the rats and pigeons is brilliant), engaging performances, fun musical numbers, and a general feel-good sweetness.It's also a movie that manages to make fun of Disney movies (of which it is one) and still embrace the sugary sweetness at their center. The movie lightly mocks love at first sight and a Pollyanna-ish world view, but ultimately it winds up simply replacing the Disney cartoon versions of these tropes with the Rom-Com versions.Honestly, I feel one could sit down and write an essay about that sleight of hand, but I won't, because a) I'm lazy, and b) it's a very fun movie that doesn't ask you to think, so I won't.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Amy Adams and a Charming Fantasy; Clever Mix of Animation and Realism,"Since the later 1970s, any film made for adults has had to be a personal project, so its creators can avoid de facto censorship by corporate tsars bent instead on supplying graphic emotional and special effects cinematic graphic drugs to their target mentally teenage addicts. ""Enchanted"" is such a vision, and less surprisingly so than it is satisfying. This I say is true because of what its makers tried to do even more than how well its creators performed that intended task. The use of animation plus filmed action in the film was not unprecedented; how seamlessly the combination works therein for many viewers may be so. This sprightly tale begins in a fantasy realm, Andalasia. We are introduced to a lovely commoner destined to marry a brave and handsome prince--despite the opposition of his mother, a true witch in several degrees, and her helper. After an animated series of songs and adventures during which we learn the young woman, Giselle, can charm animals into helping her--leading to a classic Disney historical-looking sequence--she and her prince, who has rescued her from an ogre, arrive at the royal palace to be wed; but, instead, she is sent as an exile to another realm--and emerges from a manhole in New York City. There she meets a wary, bemused but honest fellow named Robert, his daughter and his mismatched fiancée, But the brave prince soon follows her to save her, accompanied by a talkative chipmunk and followed by the Queen's besmitten aide, Nathaniel, whom we are told will try to stop the royal wedding. What succeeds this engrossing beginning I say is a gradual denouement to a satisfying ending, during which Giselle learns the limits of magic and the power of realism, and Robert learns the power of magic and the limits of doubt. This charming, fast-paced delight was directed by Kevin Lima, with script credited to Bill Kelly. Seven credited producers hired Alan Menken tosupply clever music, and Don Burgess to supply innovative cinematography and to incorporate the animated portions. Production Designer Stuart Wurtzel and Art Director John Kasarda dealt professionally with a variety of locales, ranging from an apartment to New York offices, stores and street features to a grand ballroom and Central Park. Set Decorator George DeTitta Jr. and Costume Designer Mona May deserved plaudits for their stellar work as well. The able cast includes likable Patrick Dempsey as Robert, James Marsden as the bravura Prince, Idina Menzel as the fiancée, Timothy Spall outstanding as Nathaniel, Susan Sarandon as the wonderfully witch evil Queen, Rachel Covey as Robert's cute daughter, Elizabeth Mathis as Robert's secretary, and talented Tonya Pinkins and Isiah Whitlock Jr. as battling divorce partners. But the core of the film I suggest is Amy Adams' award-level, lovely and memorable Giselle. Watch for a remarkable action-character development crisis, and a memorable ending during which all loose ends are neatly tied up so that all concerned can live on, mostly happily ever after.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Magical and Charming Fairytale with a Modern Twist,"Enchanted is a delightful blend of classic Disney magic and modern-day humor, creating a fun and heartwarming experience. The film takes the traditional fairy tale formula and cleverly flips it, bringing animated princess Giselle into the real world, where she navigates the challenges of modern life in New York City.Amy Adams is simply enchanting in the lead role, perfectly capturing the innocence, optimism, and charm of a classic Disney princess. Her performance is both sincere and comedic, making Giselle one of the most memorable Disney characters of the modern era. Patrick Dempsey provides a great contrast as the grounded and skeptical Robert, and their chemistry adds to the film's charm. The supporting cast, including James Marsden as the hilariously over-the-top Prince Edward and Susan Sarandon as the wicked Queen Narissa, enhance the fairy-tale-meets-reality concept beautifully.The film balances nostalgia and satire well, paying homage to classic Disney animated films while adding fresh humor and heart. The musical numbers, particularly ""That's How You Know,"" are catchy and filled with joy, making them stand out in Disney's live-action catalog.Overall, Enchanted is a magical and feel-good film that successfully bridges the gap between classic fairy tales and the real world. Amy Adams shines in a role tailor-made for her, and the film's humor, heart, and music make it a truly charming watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
what a real love is,"This was my first time to see this kind of Disney love story. Usually, in Disney movie, the prince and princess get together happily, but this was a little different.A princess looking for love with a prince some day suddenly comes to real world we live in accident. Then she met a man who is a single father. For him, she seems to be strange because she always believes miracles and importance to have a dream. At first, he gets upset because she causes lots of troubles. However, little by little, he comes not to leave her alone. On the other hand, she learns what a date is, what a real love is from him, and she starts to feel staying with him is much fun. But a witch appears and interrupts them.This story told me how important to stay being happy. We often think dreaming somethings apart from reality are just silly and sometimes make fun of the people who believes that. But we should believe things would be better and hopeful to be happy. Moreover, this told me even if you and your partner have difficulties, you should trust and not to be afraid to take a step forward.I recommend you watch this.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Just watch it,"This is a very enjoyable musical film suitable for people of all ages. At least you can buy a good laugh if you feel you're so over fairy tales.Giselle is a fairy tale character who has been dreaming of her prince. One day the prince finally comes to rescue her and they're going to get married. On the way to the wedding the prince's stepmother sets Giselle up and sends her to the real world - New York City where she meets Robert and Morgan...The use of animation for the fairy tale world is very clever and I didn't expect that. It's just so familiar and so Disney.The development is in general simple and direct, which is quite good indeed for a fairy tale. But I'm not very satisfied with the abrupt ending (maybe you can say this is what you would expect from a fairy tale: you just need a happily ever after).The music is very well-written and perfect for the film. Happy working song and That's how you know are particularly funny. The singing is also great. Amy Adams's voice is great and her way of singing is quite old-fashioned but I have to say it matches the stereotype of fairy tale songs. This is a plus. James Marsden and Jon McLaughlin have also done a good job.Adams's performance as a super optimistic fairy tale character is very convincing. Some people may find it a bit over but this is what the character's really like. Dempsey as a realist is not bad but the character itself is the plainest in the film. Maybe that's why they have to look for his personal charm. Marsden's funny, Pip's very funny. The most unexpected is Nathaniel. It's really interesting to see from the beginning to the end how he sees senses. Others are worth their salt.Just watch it or you'll regret it. After years of fairy tales with CG we've got a 'real' good deal here. At least their music is never as great.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

One Mushy Song Is Overshadowed By The Self-Awareness Of The Plot.,"Enchanted came out when I was 9 years old. When I was little, going to the movies was a rare occurrence, and I was ecstatic at the news of going to see one this time.Then the movie began, and all was lost. At the time, I HATED Enchanted. However, as I have gotten older, I've warmed up to it, and while I don't think it's a flawless movie, it's a good one that is a bit enchanted.The movie starts out animated, where Princess Giselle (Amy Adams) dreams of getting her true love's kiss. She meets her true love, Edward (James Mardsen), and they decide to wed. However, on their wedding day, the jealous queen (Susan Sarandon) transports her to the real world in New York City, thinking that there are no happily ever afters there. It's in The Big Apple where Giselle meets the cynical father Robert (Patrick Demspey), and finds out what true love actually is.Like I said, I did NOT like this movie upon my first viewing. You may be wondering why. Well, imagine you are the child I described- a 9 year old boy who loves movies yet rarely got to go to the cinema at the time. Now imagine yourself as that child, and the movie opens with a song that goes:""I've been dreaming of a true love's kiss, and a prince I'm hoping comes with this, that's what makes ever-aftering so happy, so happy...""Yeah. I wanted to puke. And while that song still makes me cringe today, there is still plenty to enjoy about the movie, the performances being one of them. I like them all for what they are, but the best is easily Susan Sarandon, who does such a splendid job playing a villainess that I'm bummed that she hasn't done it much more.The Disney movie also has many references to their princess movies. Snow White is a prime one- with a poison apple, a jealous queen, the assistance of animals to clean the house she is a guest in, and so much more. Cinderella is alluded to with the glass slipper, Sleeping Beauty with the true love battling a dragon, and I'm sure there are other notable ones.There are also cameos from Disney Princess voice actors- such as Jodi Benson (Ariel) as a secretary, and Paige O'Hara (Belle) on a TV program.Enchanted doesn't really have many songs (surprisingly), and the soundtrack is...fine. The strongest song, ironically, is a different love song- That's How You Know. Even when I loathed this movie, I could admit that song was catchy. I still don't care for the mushiness of True Love's Kiss, it makes me cringe to this day.One thing that I like now about the movie is the meaning of true love. Giselle learns that falling in the lap of a prince is not falling in love, and who she really loves makes for a nice change of pace for a Disney romance.While I don't care for True Love's Kiss, once you pass that part, Enchanted is a sweet movie that also jabs at Disney's own famous works, another pleasure that the movie offers. It doesn't deserve the title of perfect, but it does deserve the title of Enchanted.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Simply an Enchanting Movie! Take it to Broadway!,"Amy Adams is simply delightful as Giselle, the engaged woman of Prince Edward, in a land called Anadalusia, a land where it lives in Animation.

The cast is first rate with Amy Adams as Giselle, James Marsden as Prince Edward, Timothy Spall OBE as Nathaniel- the queen's henchman, Susan Sarandon as the wicked stepmother, Tony Winner Idina Menzel who won for playing Elfaba on Broadway's Wicked plays Nancy, the girlfriend, of PAtrick Dempsey's character, Robert. Robert takes Giselle in because his six year old motherless daughter, Morgan, insists that she is a princess. Of course, this is a Disney film. I'm sorry that one of the songs didn't win the Academy award for Best Original Song.

Lives up to its Enchanted title well,"This movie has it all: a cleverly playful script, a talented ensemble cast playing appealing characters, an array of wonderful songs in its score, a pleasant story to tell, and just a whole lot of fun.It's vintage Disney, who have retold many classic fairy tale stories about princesses falling in love and getting married, getting the better of an unpleasant witch who is trying to do them in, and living happily ever after. Now they take a turn poking some satirical yet affectionate fun at their own formula. The movie remembers that the heart of fantasy is for the nice character to have their happy ending, and it takes you on a great ride to get there. Amy Adams is splendid as the typical fairy tale land princess with the frilly dresses with big shoulder things (and lots of forest creature friends) getting shot through a magical portal to modern day New York. Her sweet and naive character is immediately endearing, and as she spreads her optimism, sentimentality, and good will to strangers, inspiring them all; it's really a sweet thing to see. I love the way the song in Central Park is choreographed; funny and touching all at once. Be on the lookout for Prince Charming's encounter with a fire-breathing bus; brilliant silliness.The film remembers to dole out lots of happy endings to almost everybody, a nice touch. A very fun and entertaining movie which can appeal to a wide audience.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

This story is set in the real world and animated world.It is impossible that we live in the situation,but it can be in the fairytale.In this point, this movie is very good for children.They can see a dreamily world,and they can have dreams.Please go to see this movie with your family.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
When Two Worlds Collide,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect from ""Enchanted"": corny retread of Disney themes or inspired genre-bending? The movie begins in the animated world of Andalasia, which borrows copiously from ""Snow White"". We have the young damsel (named Giselle) loved by woodland creatures, her knight-in-shining-armor (Prince Edward), and the evil stepmother (Queen Narissa). So far, signs point to corny retread. Novelty is introduced as Giselle is sent packing down a wormhole by the evil queen because Giselle's impeding marriage to Prince Edward will dethrone Narissa. At the end of the wormhole, Giselle pops up through a manhole onto the streets of New York City, sans animation.Giselle is clueless in this new world, and the naive woman is befriended by conservative divorce lawyer Robert Phillip (Patrick Dempsey) and his daughter, Morgan. I still wasn't sure about the movie until one scene in particular laid its hook in me, and the film kept me hooked the rest of the way. In Andalasia, Giselle had sung out her window to beckon woodland creatures to help her in her work. When faced with Robert's messy apartment, she does the same thing, but, ya know, this is New York City. So what should respond to her call but pigeons, rats, flies, and cockroaches. Not batting an eye at the obvious decline in quality of her beckonees, Giselle happily orchestrates the creatures while singing ""The Happy Working Song"". Brilliant!Since the collision of animated fairytale-land with the contemporary real world is mostly virgin territory, there were many possible ways this venture could play out. For the most part, the makers of this film hit the nail on the head. By juxtaposing these two different worlds, the filmmakers manage to astutely compare and contrast these worlds, identifying what is good and bad in each of them. The fairytale-land of classic romance-based Disney movies such as ""Snow White"" and ""The Little Mermaid"" create an enchanted world of childlike enthusiasm and trust, because, after all, they're aimed at children. But these movies also contain old social mores in which people, especially young women, are more wrapped up in the ideal image of love and marriage rather than the specific personality of their lovers. Contemporary New Yorkers, on the other hand, have become so involved with their careers in a callous, fast- paced world that they've become too calculated and cynical when it comes to love. ""Enchanted""brings about a rich cross-fertilization between these worlds as Philip is genuinely affected by Giselle's childlike enthusiasm and belief in love, and Giselle comes to realize that it may be a good idea to actually get to know your lover before you marry him.Amy Adams is simply remarkable in manifesting the naivety, childlike enthusiasm, and pure sincerity of a classic Disney princess into the real world of contemporary New York. Prince Edward follows Giselle to New York City, and James Marsden does a fine job of portraying Edward as a classic full-of-himself jock. Susan Sarandon and Timothy Spall are well-cast as the classic Disney villains. Giselle's lovable sidekick Pip, a chipmunk, even gets a real world makeover via CGI, and he enriches the story by engaging in many hilarious antics. All in all, the cast from Andalusia does create a sense of enchantment that would make Walt Disney proud, and the New York cast help the Andalasians break out of their outdated social mindset to get a better grip on reality. While being a fun ride, some good moral lessons are provided for the young and old alike.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
loved the music and story,"I really liked the story and the songs were good too. The movie starts out with a cartoon princess and her animal friends. She is set to marry Prince Edward whom she's known a day. But Edward's step mom, Queen Narrisa, sends Gizelle to real world New York City. Amy Adams was perfect for this character. She sings well and has this sweet, high pitched voice perfect for being a Princess. Gizelle falls into the lap of Robert, whom has a little girl and a girlfriend of 5 years. It's not long before Gizelle realizes there's more to finding a guy than one can do in a day and wants more than the dazzling smile from Prince Edward. Edward finds her, but she wants to go on a date at the Queen's Ball. Narrisa comes to New York to stop the 2 and she becomes the big ending. Does Gizelle want more than a fairy tale typical romance? Does Edward get a wife? Watch to find out.This movie was funny also. From Gizelle making her own clothes to Edward's fascination with the TV. Quite a few funny scenes.FINAL VERDICT: Adults and kids will like this a lot. I suggest check it out.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

This movie when played just took us with it ...... i loved everything in it, I mean it EVERYTHING, the animations were wonderful and, the actors all performed remarkably. I enjoyed all the scenes n especially the ones in which the Chipmunk tries to tell the Prince about Giselle but he fails to understand. I was also quite amazed to c that the animations and the actors had such a close resemblance. Thumbs up to Disney.

Enchanted movie-making,"What a fun and heartwarming movie. I'll not comment on the cast,plot, etc., the previous commenters have pretty well covered those areas very nicely. I'm a movie-making technology buff and am amazed at how well ""Enchanted""'s film-makers held together a movie with at least ten different styles of movie-making like classic animation, live action, etc., etc. It's as if someone at the House of Mouse walked down a very long hall pulling people out of offices labelled ""Classic Animation"", ""CGI"", ""Live Casting"", ""Disney on Broadway"", etc. saying to them on the way ""We're going to make a movie called ""Enchanted"" and I want you all to work on it and I want you all to do your best work"". And then that person added: ""And this is still Walt Disney's place and I don't want you to be bashful about letting this movie's viewers know Walt's still around here somewhere - and we're still damned proud of every movie he made"".The Wife's comment (after reading Hubby's ""critique""): ""I haven't shed so many tears of pure and innocent joy since I was seven years old.

My royal pain.,"Wow have just seen this film twice in 2 days n at both showings there was only 2 other people in the cinema bar me and my companion(and mum on the second viewing) which i cannot understand but my was it worth the overall £10 it cost me to view it twice. This film is captivating throughout and is possibly the best film i have seen in ages. the acting is amazing, the characters are adorable, and the comical set pieces will keep me giggling for weeks to come. granted the ending was a bit rubbish but what Disney film has a good ending apart from the lion king? Anyway i would recommend this film to anyone, the only thing you will have to worry about will be how to retrieve your masculinity after enjoying such a film, n if you can watch this film n not feel good afterwards then i suggest you take a long look at your self n realise your an idiot. go see this film!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
An actual true love's kiss,"Enchanted is about Giselle who was supposed to be married to her true love Prince Edward, however the prince's stepmother banishes her to a land that does not have true love and is not nice to anyone. New York City. We follow Giselle where she meets Robert and his young daughter, Morgan. She stays with them whilst she looks for her prince and whilst Robert is making plans to propose to his girlfriend. Prince Edward will follow Giselle into New York. Trickery by the stepmother occurs to prevent Giselle and the prince seeing again. When all fails, she makes Giselle eat a poisoned apple but who would her true love kiss be to awaken her?Good movie, with quite with lots laughs. You could have thought the movie was actually a parody of princess movies on how they actually would look like in real life.This movie also backs up the thoughts I always had on princess movies, that from the time they are born they all have prechosen lovers. But, what happens if you take them out of those castles and let them meet people much like Fiona from Shrek. Majority of them would change their true lovers.Animation, quite amazing. I love it when all medians mix, though it hard and expensive it sad it hardly ever done these days.Did not like their singing, songs were fine but singing not so much10/10 - All round good movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
This film makes me happy.,"I watched this film for the first time when I was sixth grade. Iwas excited about this true love story, songs and the cuteness of Giselle, so I watched it three times. Tobe honest, I thought Amy Adams was little bit old for a princess at first, because she was in thirties then. She wears a youthful wedding dress at the beginning. However, as the story progress, I was fascinated by her beautiful voice and smile, so I love Giselle and Amy Adams now.Patrick Dempsey plays a square and realistic lawyer Robert. James Marsden plays an insensible but pure prince Edward. all casts fit their roles, so I can't come up with other casting. I heard that a sequel of this movie would be made, so I look forward to watch it.When I watch the singing scene in this, I can be happy and want to sing like Giselle. Thus, the film will make you begin to feel cheerful. Off course, the true love story lets your heart skip a beat, so please check it out.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

"A fun, enjoyable movie.","I must say that this is one of the best Family movies I've seen in a while. Funny, charming, likable. I don't usually write reviews, but I liked this movie so much. Amy Adams was great as Giselle, and the rest of the cast was good as well. A bit predictable in some parts, but not boring. It sucked me in, and not once during the movie was I wondering when it would be over. It's a classical Disney tale twisted, where the Prince and the Princess don't fall in love, and has a new take on a more modern romantic view. Most of the characters are likable, the slightly arrogant but ultimately kind hearted Prince. The bumbling sidekick of the Queen. The naive Princess, and the cynical, single dad divorce lawyer who falls in love with her. Also, the first movie I've ever been to where at the end the whole theater clapped.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

I'm embarrassed to say this ... but it was really good.,"I'm kind of an action / sci-fi / thriller movie enthusiast, so movies that sound family-oriented and fluffy usually don't cut it for me.Well, this one is one few exceptions. It was well-done and innovative ... and very enjoyable. About 12 minutes in, the movie switches from cartoon animation to real-life ... which is an interesting twist for a fairy-tale type movie. Amazingly, the story succeeds on pure acting and story, not on special effects.The basic setup: A princess is about to be married and become queen. However, the evil reigning queen does not want to give up her title. So, she transports the princess to another reality ... modern day New York City. But all is not lost, her prince charming and others transport there too in an effort to find her ... but not all of them want her back safe and sound.Yes, there's singing, happy flying birds and the whole nine yards ... but it all works and is somehow ""believable"". I think the latter is due to the fine acting jobs by Amy Adams (princess) and Patrick Dempsey (the lawyer she meets in New York). She's all about fantasy ideals and he's all about the real world pragmatism - and their interactions are fun to watch. If sounds simplistic, it is ... but it works.Instead of saying this movie is ""great for all members of the family"", I'd like to address those who would not ordinarily see a movie like this: take a chance this one time; you'll be glad you did.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney's Version of Shrek,"Enchanted is a really enjoyable fairy tale spoof film. This is basically the Disney version of Shrek, but with fairy tale meets reality. And that's how the comedy mostly works. It would demonstrate how reality can be a bad place and can have a happily ever after at the same time. Like with the connection of Giselle and Robert. And I must say the mixture of 2D animation and live action is great. Well, it's not necessary perfect with some fan service from Disney Princess films. But at least it can be forgiving as a romantic comedy. If you've enjoyed fairy tale spoofs and need something worth laughing, this is the film to check out. Even if this was made years before that film, this felt much better executed than Godmothered. Not in the levels of Shrek, but worth a good laugh.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Well-Written, Original & Surprisingly Memorable.","I've never been a fan of fairy tale movies or movies including princesses and princes and magical kingdoms and all that stuff. So, when I finished watching Enchanted I wondered why I fell in love with the movie.I'll start by saying Amy Adams is amazing playing the naive but sweet Giselle, the girl who's sent out of fairy tale world into the real world. The performance is funny, adequately over-the-top at times, serious and emotional when needed and great overall.Patrick Dempsey, who I've always liked since movies like Scream 3 or his guest role in Once & Again, is another great casting decision. The character he plays, Robert, is just a regular guy, but he has that humanness to him, that subtlety that turns an ordinary character into a memorable one.James Marsden does a very good job as Prince Edward, Timothy Spall is hilarious, and ??? is also great as Robert's daughter. Oh, and Pip the chipmunk, who steals quite a few of the scenes.I love the story and how it's told. I think the script is very well-written and the plot is paced appropriately. Giselle is such a memorable protagonist and I think the movie has all the elements to be known as a classic Disney film.Enchanted currently ranks as my #6 film of 2007 and is probably the oddest movie on the list. Like I said, this is the type of movie I wouldn't really care about, but Enchanted managed to capture my attention and I gotta say that the movie gets better and better with each viewing.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Just beautiful and very captivating!,"As a believer of true love, I'd say you gotta give this film some credit. The acting and singing were great, and Amy Adams' performance was superb! Princess Giselle is a combination of all Disney princesses, with the exception that she is a hopeless romantic. And not surprisingly, so am I. This movie is filled with interesting characters with unnaturally funny lines. There's the sweet, beautiful princess Giselle, her handsome prince Edward, the average but kindhearted man Robert and his daughter Morgan, the wicked queen and many others. This film is a charming combination of humor, music, romance, and fantasy, which is filled with a type of charisma that makes it unique from all the other movies/romance movies of this century. I recommend that you watch it and learn one thing from it: There is no such thing as an ""happily ever after."" Always let love find you at the right place and at the right time.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Amazing!,"This was a brilliant movie. And it was mainly because Amy Adams was absolutely perfect as Giselle. She brought so much life to the screen and was just such a lovable character. Prince Edward was really funny, and so was Pip. I enjoyed this movie throughout. I loved the songs that were played, you could they were originals. Robert's little girl was very cute as the girl who just wants to believe in fairy tales. And Amy Adams is marvelous as Giselle, who shows Morgan that you can still believe in them. I thought the combining of the animated world and the real world was a very clever idea. It just goes to show how different fairy tales are to our lives. But this movie also shows that the two can combine. Dreams can come true. And true love can be found. Amazing movie. Recommended to anyone and everyone, especially those who need to believe in love again.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Okay, I am not the only one that thinks this is a gem among Disney films","For me to award an 8 is very rare. This film I just got finished watching poked fun at the Disney genre and I laughed out loud at least a dozen times. It is not fair to compare this film to those of the Shrek series which I also hold in high esteem. Both offer a tongue in cheek lampoon of the 'fairy tale', but this one was totally unexpected.It is refreshing to see Disney lampoon themselves. I also think it is pretty clear that this film took a poke at Shrek too. I think it will take several viewings to get all of the jokes and homages. ""Enchanted"" appears to be a relatively low budget film yet the special effects & CG that were there were very convincing and downright funny as all get out.Best go in without reading the blurb on the back of the DVD box. I was very surprised by this new approach to the 'Happily Ever After' and was glad I knew nothing going in. I expected to just walk away but was glued to the screen and very pleased.

Enchanting!,"Taking clues from Disney classics like 'Snow White,' Cinderella,' 'Sleeping Beauty,' and 'Beauty and the Beast,' Kevin Lima's 'Enchanted' is an all around sweet and fun and charming movie. The animated portions are wonderful with vibrant colorful backdrops, and the live-action sequences are well-shot. The script is delightful, witty, and engaging, the film's songs are gloriously cheerful and amusing, and seasoned Disney director Lima delivers them right. Every scene is meticulously and articulately crafted. All the cast are excellent, but Amy Adams, with all wide-eyed innocence and a sparkle in her eyes, is perfect and absolutely fantastic as Giselle. Enchanting!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Exciting,"I like this movie's style. This movie use both animation and live filming styles. When I watched this movie at first, I was so exciting. This is one of the Disney movies. Especially, it is high quality. I think that Amy Adams who acts Giselle is a great actress. She completely expresses a view of the Disney's world. Of course, other actors and actresses express that, but Giselle is the best. I was impressed when see her hand motion. That is the real Disney's character. I want those who watch the movie to focus of that point. The story is also great. I recommend to watch this movie at least once. It takes us to Disney world.",,Anonymous,Animation
Good,"Yeah, the story is formulaic, predictable, but it's still a lot of fun. I can't imagine anyone doing a better job than Amy Adams in the lead role. It could have been a disaster, and the whole over-the-top princess obvious tone could have gotten annoying, but Adams always remains likable. In that respect, she's the main reason to see this. The story could have used a little more cleaning up, and a lot of times the script feels like it's rushing to get to the inevitable finale. But there are a lot of great jokes and individual scenes throughout that makes it more than worthwhile. Check this one out with the whole family, you'll enjoy it.",,Anonymous,Animation
This is the best film ever in my life.,"This film is produced by Disney. This story is like Cinderella, Snow White and Sleeping Beauty. In this film, there are many points which remind us about these Disney animations. Finding these points is very exciting. This movie is mixed live-action, animation and musical. The heroine, Giselle is so cute and she has a pure heart. Amy Adams starring this film as Giselle, is very beautiful. She is like real princess from Disney animation world. Musical songs are also fantastic. These songs cheer me up. This film is love comedy so there are many points which make us funny. Prince Edward has good character. He is very funny.

Typical Disney movie,"Giselle lives in Andalasia and believes ""true love"" and someday a perfect prince will come to her. Finally he comes to her but his step mother sends her to New York.First of all, I don't like Disney movies because it always says ""true Love"". As usual, this film shows ""true love"" too and I don't like this part. Also this film is little bit childish and maybe children like this. Excepting them, I like musical movies. Amy Adams and James Marsden sing the songs well. They also play nice. Giselle and Prince Edward come from fairyland and they seem animated cartoon characters. Thus they overact a little but it is just right.And I like the songs. In the film, I want to sing with them and I want to sing them alone after watching.

Giselle believes true love and love prince Edward, but she falls in love with Robert after she arrived New York. What will happen to them? I think this movie give us happy. It is good that you see this movie when you depressed. There are many elements of Walt Disney Pictures such as the sleeping Beauty, the Snow White and Cinderella. If you watch some Disney movie, you notice that this scene is the sleeping beauty! However, you can except end of the movie in the middle of the movie, you may like it.",,Anonymous,Animation
Interesting,"Disney Animation perfectly protects children's dream. For example, Disney Animation prohibits voice actors and actresses to speak as the character with showing their face. Disney completely keeps such a secret. However, in this film, the forbidden rule is broken. Characters going back and forth between a live action and an animation. It is surprising, interesting and a great idea. Actors and actresses of a live action and characters of an animation are very similar and nothing strange. Both of them are all attractive and nice. Disney Animation succeeds in to full the real world with the dream and also shows that there is the dream even in the reality.",,Anonymous,Animation
beautiful,"it reminds the flavor, tension and beauty of the great old fashion shows. it is one of pieces of golden age of Disney studio. it gives a nuanced form for fairy tales and love stories. it is spectacular and great, amusing and seductive. pure show, it is perfect choice for each age. and that could be all. but the most interesting aspect is the cast. Amy Adams is brilliant as the young princess and Patrick Dempsey an inspired choice for the lawyer. the animation has the perfect place and New York as the scene for a crazy - seductive story seems the splendid choice. but, more than a love story/fairy tale, its message is the real virtue. because it is useful and precise. because it is a beautiful pledge for discover the other. because it reminds a kind of romanticism who seems, in too many occasions, lost at all.",,Anonymous,Animation
Billy Kelly makes it work,"It's easy to underestimate the fantasy form, especially when it's a Disney family picture like Enchanted. But writer Bill Kelly knows his genre and its potential, especially when it's mixed with other forms.Enchanted is really a combination of fantasy, fairy tale, romantic comedy, musical and the traveling angel story. That's a lot of forms, which is why this film is more complicated than it appears. Most writers trying to mix all those genres end up with a structural mess. Too many heroes, too many desire lines, too many story beats and so on. But Kelly makes it work.One reason for the film's success is that Kelly has combined genres that work well together. Fantasy and musical have very similar thematic underpinnings. Both are about learning how to live well, which they define as forming a community. Love stories are about creating a community of two. The traveling angel story concerns a (usually) perfect person who enters a community in trouble and sets it right.Now all of this thematic unity doesn't change the fact that mixing so many forms is tricky. Kelly starts by establishing the foundation of the story, which is the fantasy and fairy tale opening world. Though an apparent utopia, the world has a big flaw, which is the jealous queen. And the princess, though apparently perfect and about to be married, has a flaw as well. She has no emotional depth and therefore is about to marry the wrong person. One of the nice touches here is that the audience is no more aware of this at the beginning than is the princess. The viewer, having seen decades of Disney films, is as caught up in the promise of fairy tale life as the princess is. But this weakness is crucial because it creates the need in one of the lovers that is essential for a good love story.With the foundation set, the heroine travels to the second, fantastical world. Ironically this film flips the beat and makes the second world all too real, modern day New York. But for the Princess it is a nightmare, a dystopia, and, true to the fantasy form, it is where the heroine will learn her great life lesson. It is also where the traveling angel plot kicks in. Using music and her own boundless, fairy tale optimism, she begins to help the characters who are in trouble and turns the cold New Yorkers in Central Park into a utopian community.This is also where the love story line resumes. The man who helps her out has his own weakness and need. He's a single dad who doesn't believe in love. He needs to feel love again, for himself and his daughter. From this point on the film plays out the key beats of the fantasy, love story and traveling angel story. One of the fun aspects of modern fairy tales is seeing how the writer comes up with modern equivalents of fairly tale elements, like transformations, spells and kingdoms. For example, when the Princess finds herself in need of a fairy godmother, the daughter pulls out the greatest wish fulfiller of all time, dad's credit card.Hollywood blockbuster films are all about mixing genres. Even pleasant little children's stories are more difficult than they appear, because they usually require a lot of forms. If you are interested in modernizing a fairy tale - which is a very successful story strategy - check out the Great Screen writing Class. For fantasy, of course, go to the Horror, Fantasy and Science Fiction Class or the Fantasy Software. You can learn Romantic Comedy in the Love Story Class or Software, or in the Comedy Class or Software. I explain the ever-popular Traveling Angel story in the Comedy Class and Software.Above all, try to combine forms that work well together. In Enchanted, writer Bill Kelly shows the tremendous advantage that comes from knowing your craft.FOR MORE REVIEWS, please visit www.truby.com",,Anonymous,Animation
