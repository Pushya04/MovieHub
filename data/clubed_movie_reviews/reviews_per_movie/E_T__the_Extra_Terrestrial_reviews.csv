"Mawkish it may be, but it's a classic for a reason","E.T. THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL was one of those films that everybody took for granted as a child in the 1980s. Everybody had seen it, everybody loved it, everybody could reference it with the other kids knowing what they were talking about. Finding myself less than impressed than Steven Spielberg's overt sentimentalism, I wondered how I'd find it as an adult...Well, I needn't have worried, because E.T. still hits the mark. Yes, it's mawkish and rather dated, but I think that's all part of the fun. This is the classic kid's film of the 1980s, in which the adults are portrayed as either out of touch or the enemy; it's the kids who have to band together to fight for justice, and the template works very well here.Inevitably, the character of E.T. himself is what makes this film. The Carlo Rambaldi special effects still stand the test of time and the voice mannerisms are just right. Henry Thomas has a tough role, acting against an non-human for the most part, but he excels in the part and the frog scene is still excellent. Drew Barrymore is very effective too. E.T. is certainly a film that still manages to tug at the heartstrings with all of the increasing drama and that poignant ending, and I love it just as much as I always did.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of my best childhood memories ever!!,There's honestly nothing bad I can say about this movie. I loved ET when I was a little child and now at 39 I still love the movie!! Everytime I watch this MOVIE it makes me feel like a little kid again. It's very entertaining sweet and cool. Still there is one thing I have to mention. Steven Spielberg brought out a special DVD version of this movie. Which is called ET the special edition. It's still the same fabulous movie we all know. They just improved on 12% of the special effects and also included a never-before-seen fun and interesting scene where you learn ET can breathe underwater. It is an absolute must buy if you are a big fan of this movie. I will love this movie till the day I die. I always wished Spielberg had made a very emotional and cool sequel.,8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Powerful and unique,"Spielberg's powerful and remarkable film about a boy and his unusual befriendment of an extra terrestrial. Possibly his finest film, E.T. captures a piece of childhood, and reminds the rest of us of a time long since past. It excites a story adults often forget, and a powerful remembrance of a childhood friendship during difficult periods of development. Adult criticism of the movie loses its youthful bond, and fails to appreciate growing up in the 80's. This is the pinnacle of Spielberg's childhood movies. Few other films capture as powerful a message of childhood emotion. Other films which attempt to do so dive so deep into childhood memories they lose their connection with adults, and degrade to brief interludes of ""dumb"" comic relief to keep grown ups from falling asleep. The closest runner up is likely Goonies (a film written by Spielberg). A very personal film for Spielberg; as he explores atypical friendships after the separation of his father; he should be commended for achieving such a remarkable success and for sharing it with the rest of us. I was five when I first saw the movie, and although it frightened me at the time, it still makes me cry. An unparalleled film in its class, it is easy to see why it remains the fourth all time grossing film (adjusted for inflation, third otherwise) seventeen years after its release. Cheers to Spielberg for not ruining the movie by attempting a sequel.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Ahead of its time,"I still can't believe this came out in 1982. It looks like it was made a lot later with better technology.. I mean 1982 had some real old lookin stinkers and E.T. was so ahead of it's time, back when Spielberg was in his prime!! I remember seeing this at the theater multiple times and I was born in December of 1977 so I couldn't have been any older than 4! I am watching it with my two girls as I type this. They are ages 10 and 8 and they are absolutely mesmerized lol.. also I'd like to point out the GREAT acting especially by Henry Thomas (Elliot). If you ever get a chance to look on YouTube, look up his original audition for this movie. It'll blow you away.. Anyway, E.T. is a timeless classic not to ever be forgotten.

"~A Child's Fantasy, an Adult's Memory~","Today when I was at my house alone, looking through my DVDs, trying to figure out which movie I should see for entertainment. I saw E.T and I hadn't seen it for nearly 3-4 years ago. I seen the film ever since I was 4 years old, so I wondering if I would still enjoy it when I'm an adult. As I was watching the film, I had this rush of nostalgia running through me, I was remembering the times when I was a kid with my family. The film didn't at all feel to childish to me, I was actually having a lot of fun, like I used to when I was a kid. This film has not aged at all since 30 years ago. This film is a truly timeless film, and will always be remembered. This is one of the best Steven Spielberg films. (And that is no easy task) A Timeless Classic 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I appreciate it now more than ever,"Whilst visiting Earth an Alien is accidentally left behind and strikes up a friendship with a young boy.The story centres around E.T. and his relationship with three children in a family where the parents are divorced and the father is not around. Much has been written about how autobiographical the movie is about Spielberg's own childhood and lots of unique little moments along these lines are captured in the most cinematic way possible. In fact some of the strongest scenes involve simple interaction between the family and their friends. These are not idealised Hollywood versions of families, but natural slices of suburban life that always feel real.E.T.'s arrival and the events that follow help to fill the emptiness in the heart of the youngest son Elliott and they soon form a psychic bond together. Peace, tolerance and communication are explored constantly as we see visuals and hear dialogue connected to these themes throughout the movie.We see everything from E.T.'s perspective and share his experience as an alien visitor in a strange world. Nothing is explained, because what we see with our own eyes tells us everything we need to know. In fact the visuals are so powerful there was very little I had to explain to my three year old companion as she watched it with me.Everything builds towards a spectacular climax, which is one of the greatest scenes in cinematic history. Again very little is said as this wonderfully emotional sequence very efficiently breaks our hearts.I didn't care much for E.T. during the 80s. I think it's because I was conditioned from a very young age by more violent and action orientated movies. Also, my mother was quite enthusiastic about it which back then could scrape the cool off most things. It was not until I was pushing forty with a three year old daughter that my perspective changed forever.Well done Mr Spielberg, probably your finest moment.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Classic Of Family Classics,"The classic of family classics, 'E.T.' is a wonderful and heartfelt portrait of childhood exploring the friendship between Elliot, a young boy living in California, and an extra-terrestrial who gets accidentally left behind by his spaceship. From the multiple viewings during my childhood to the nostalgic sense of warmth I get from watching it nowadays, there is no way I can fault this science fiction masterpiece. One of Spielberg's greatest films, 'E.T.' is a compassionate and emotionally-driven tale packed with clever storytelling, bold direction and state-of-the-art visual effects.. oh and it also features one of the most iconic images in cinema history. A remarkable adventure that acts as both a touching family drama and an exciting sci-fi flick, and one that needs to be seen by all.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I don't think it's held up that well over the years,"It's one of those films that, even though it was influential and considered a classic, it isn't talked about as much as other classics from that era, like Back to the Future, Star Wars or Terminator, except when someone praises its John Williams score and cinematography. Even when discussing Steven Spielberg films E. T. tends to get overlooked, as most people tend to talk about Indiana Jones or Jurassic Park before E. T.I saw it as a 24-year-old, so it probably hit me the way it was intended - a magical relationship is spawned between two children from different planets, even though they have limited ability to communicate verbally, and how the earthling kids help their alien friend go home. But think how it might be remembered if you were an actual kid and see #1 a creepy looking alien #2 living in your shed and #3 then heavily breathing and running full speed at Elliot (the bed outside part) . It could end up scaring you as much as Spielberg's Poltergeist scared me a few weeks later. So if you remember it as a horror film, you'll not likely be introducing your kids to this.I think E. T. reached its cultural saturation tipping point, and the people who grew up with it burned out on the hype pretty quickly. It, unfortunately, became indelibly linked in people's consciousness with schmaltz like photoshoots with Michael Jackson, an insipid Neil Diamond ballad, its notorious Atari 2600 game, and cheesy knockoffs like Mac & Me. And there was no getting away from the schmaltz as all of this happened right before cable became ubiquitous so most people were still stuck with the three networks and whatever they aired.Watching it now that I'm older I appreciate how busy the mother - Dee Wallace - was, and how preoccupied. For example, she comes in the kitchen after returning from a long day at work and finds several empty beer cans on the floor (ET had a mini beer fest earlier in the day), realizes she's the only adult in the house, and yet thinks nothing more of it. ET walks behind her several times while she is rearranging things in the fridge, but she's too busy to notice the inebriated alien in the bathrobe behind her. I know I've had days like that.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Very touching movie about a special friendship for all ages that will warm your heart and make you cry,"E.T. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL, in my opinion, is a very touching movie about a special friendship for all ages that will warm your heart and make you cry. I really loved the magic that E.T. performed. If I could have, I would have helped him get to safety myself. The only problem is how I would get him to safety, since I can't drive. The score was good, the costumes were perfectly designed, everyone was cast perfectly, and the direction was flawless. In conclusion, I highly recommend this very touching movie about a special friendship for all ages to anyone who hasn't seen it. You're in for a real treat and a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with someone close to you, and watch it. I guarantee you you'll thoroughly enjoy it.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I hate to say this ...,"But I still have to say, I didn't really like it very much, and I thought I did. Before watching it, I came by and read some reviews - a lot of people seemed to think it was wonderful. And no matter whether the commenters liked it or not, the consensus was that it's a ""kids"" thing and that it's sentimental, both which happened to sound very appealing to me, so that I even overlooked the cynics' comments. I mean, I like kid's movies like Home Alone, and I'm a sentimental schmuck - I loved Heart and Souls. SO I decided to watch this thinking I wouldn't be disappointed.I was disappointed. I'm still not sure why. The movie sort of dragged, making me feel bored. And I found myself way too detached from the movie than I was supposed to be. A very bad experience which proves this: I was watching this scene with the flying bike, the music was beautiful and soaring, and I was saying to myself, ""Now this is supposed to be a great moment,"" and I repeated some comment like that too at the last few scenes of the movie. The problem was, the moment I thought that, I knew whatever great moment it was supposed to be, I didn't feel that way. And that was how the whole movie was for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Takes Me Back To My Childhood, Every Single Time","Continuing my plan to watch every Steven Spielberg movie in order, I come to E.T.Alongside Field Of Dreams, this is a movie guaranteed to make me cry every single time I watch it.

After several attempts were made to match the score to the film, Spielberg took the film off the screen and told Williams to conduct the orchestra the way he would at a concert. He did, and Spielberg re-edited the film to match the music, which is unusual since the music is normally edited to match the film. The result was Williams deservedly winning the 1982 Academy Award for Best Original Score.E.T was the number 1 movie of 1982, as it grossed $359 million at the domestic box office (beating Tootise (2nd) an Officer & A Gentleman (3rd) and Rocky 3 (4th).

Cheesy Fluff,"This movie really disgusted me. But let me explain....It is not that I don't believe in sentimentality. I am a HUGE Frank Capra fan.

It's just that ""E.T."" is so phony, so synthetic, so made-up, so ENGINEERED to try to make me feel something, that I have to resent it.I'll just never understand Spielberg. For so long, I had nothing but contempt for him. Till Schindler's List. (Does anyone (other than Nazis) not like Schindler's List?)And then, too, he made Saturday-morning worth getting up for.

Still Blows Me Away to this Day,"E.T. is one of my all time favorite movies. This movie blew me out of my seat as a kid, and still kills me every time I watch it. Only four or five movies have made me cry, much less sob uncontrollably. When I returned from seeing E.T. for the first time, I couldn't talk for the rest of the day. I laid in my bed and cried for about five hours.The movie still makes tears well up in my eyes and gives me a lump in my throat. I still find it profoundly moving. It's heart-breakingly sad, yet phenomenally uplifting at the same time. I had no idea a movie could be so powerful when I saw this in the movies for the first time when I was eleven.What I think makes E.T. so powerful for me now is the heart-wrenching way it has of making me long to be a kid again. I refuse to ever completely grow up, and my memories are my own, but man does this movie make me wish I was eleven again, when riding my bike was a pleasure, Matchbox cars were the greatest thing in the world, Halloween was a night of mystery and creepy fun I looked forward to all year, going to the movies was an adventure, and looking up at the stars could be a mind-blowing experience.E.T. keeps those feeling alive for me.

Classic Film.,"Review:
'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' is a science-fiction film directed by Steven Spielberg.
After a gentle alien becomes stranded on Earth, the being is discovered and befriended by a young boy named Elliott (Henry Thomas). Bringing the extraterrestrial into his suburban California house, Elliott introduces E.T., as the alien is dubbed, to his brother and his little sister, Gertie (Drew Barrymore), and the children decide to keep its existence a secret. Soon, however, E.T. falls ill, resulting in government intervention and a dire situation for both Elliott and the alien.
E.T. is still consider one of the greatest movies ever made, and it's not hard to understand why. I just recently watched this again with my 7-yeard-old and we both had a very good time. This is a very good movie that the whole family can enjoy.
The overall acting was pretty good for it being a movie from the early 80's. I mean let's face it the stories were better and original back then, but the acting has come a long way. However, Spielberg pulled out a brilliant child performance from Henry Thomas. He did an amazing job as the main lead Elliot. You can watch his audition tape on YouTube and it's not hard to see why he got the job.
With Spielberg behind the camera, there was no way that people did not see that this was a success waiting to happen. The man does Science Fiction the way no other director can or at least has accomplished. He had three major success stories prior to E.T (Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Raiders of the Lost Ark) so having yet another brilliant success right afterwards basically cemented his name in Hollywood. The way he shoots this movie is breathtaking with a lot of wide angled takes.
Overall, this movie is just brilliant. I know there are some people that don't believe it aged well and think E.T is just creepy and don't really by into the story. But I do. I buy every single bit of it. I highly recommend this movie to anybody who loves to sit down and watch a beautiful story about friendship, and how far some will go to help an individual in need.

Extremely Overrated Mediocrity...,"Surprisingly overrated Steven Spielberg film about an alien from outer space who stumbles upon a typical Steven Spielberg 80s urban family: The kids know everything and the adults are the bad guys, because they know nothing and aren't in touch with their ""feelings."" This kids-are-smarter technique worked in a Spielberg-produced film called ""The Goonies,"" but it doesn't work here. Tries to be cute but comes off sickening and sappy. Yuck.

It's a Masterpiece,"There are those times when all the forces at work come together and you have a masterpiece. This, of course, is a kids' movie. Obviously, it is so much more. It is a story of love and heart and character. To begin with, as a middle school teacher, I can attest to the wonderful casting and writing. It doesn't insult us. It shows us how a person who knows the heart of humanity (and that extends to the alien nation) can transcend cliché and put forth a beautiful story--but not a lightweight one by any means. The adults make up the periphery. The childlike quality of the lovable alien could only be appreciated and cared for by those who have not become as jaded as they. As soon as those adult figures show up, everyone is in trouble. Yet, for the most part, they have good intentions. The government agents are another issue. They bring force and death.Who hasn't seen this. There are series of episodes that have become part of our cultural landscape. Words have been brought into our language. We speak along with Elliot and ET. Halloween, phoning home, frogs all over the lab, hiding in the closet among the stuffed animals, the bike ride where the bikes suddenly leave the ground, the touching of the finger and the heart. It's just magical. Sometimes when one sees a movie, one begins to say, ""If only they had done this or that."" I can't think of anything in this film. Why write this review.

"25 Years Later, My Message Is "" E.T. - STAY home!""","This is another blockbuster film of 25 years ago that is well-remembered but doesn't quite have the impact on multiple viewings and in years that have come-and-gone since 1982. Some movies still have a stunning impact, like Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyseey,"" or Spielberg's ""Close Encounters Of The Third Kind,"" or even Scott's ""Alien,"" but this sci-fi/alien movie seems to have lost its impact. Maybe it's just me, getting to be a cranky old man.It's still a cute show and one kids would like, except with the part where E.T. is close to death. This is another Steven Spielberg film in which the kids are smarter than the adults...and the adults are always the bad guys. He had that in a number of his popular films and I hope he is finally through with that tiresome nonsense. Maybe he actually learned that adults are smarter than six-year-olds (generally-speaking!).I got a kick out of this movie at the theater in 1982, but now it just looks too corny, manipulative and an insult to any adult's intelligence.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I love this film and believe that it is as timeless as it gets.,"This is Spielberg at his best. That is all I can say about E.T. IT's gripping, intelligent story mixed with its incredible symbolism makes it one of the best films ever made. E.T. is a story about friendship, loyalty, and family. But most of all it is about love, and how powerful love is. The brilliantly innovative shots mixed with John William's epic score makes for a masterpiece, which E.T. certainly is. The underlying theme of science vs. religion is also what makes the film great. All of these things mesh together to form the film that ""touched millions of people around the world."" Everything about this film is great. Steven Spielberg pulls off some legendary shots, and the acting from the children is excellent. It makes the film truly real. Henry Thomas as Elliot is great. Drew Barrymoore is so cute throughout he whole film and she captures the audience every time she appears on screen. Peter Coyote does great with the minimal screen time they chose to give him. The relationship between E.T. and Elliot can be marked as one of the greatest friendships in Hollywood history, and if you have not seen this film I urge you to rent it or see it somehow as soon as possible. If you want to see why everyone raves about Spielberg being the greatest director of all time see this film. It truly shows him at his best. It will not only make you laugh and make you smile, but it will touch your heart deeper than any movie has touched you before. E.T. will go down as one of the greatest films as all time. Its timelessness is one of a kind. Forget what you hear about it being overrated. See it for yourself and understand why this film is apart of a small collection of films that will stay in our hearts forever and ever.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Spielster's Done A Lot Worse.,"The eighties were a period where Spielberg began going through a transformation. By the time the nineties had arrived he had lost the plot due to his ridiculous sized budgets. In 1982 E.T. just managed to escape most of the Spielster's new ways.E.T. was fairly well made and very emotional to the young viewers, and even some of the older viewers. I couldn't describe it as magical, but instead a bit of fun. The references to Star Wars were the highlight for me.This time a 7 out of 10 for the Spielster.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Overly sentimental and manipulative tripe,"I dislike E.T. because ever time I watch it, I feel like I'm being emotionally manipulated by a series of cutesy images, plot mechanisms that defy logic, and a score that is WAY over the top.E.T. is supposed to be an intelligent being, capable of interstellar travel, but in this movie, he is relegated to the role, basically, of a child, and acts as such. I guess that's part of the point of the movie: the parallels between E.T. and Elliot (yes, I know: Elliot's initials are ET). That they are each lost and lonely, one in his own world, the other in a place far from home. But even understanding that does not make this movie any more palatable to me.  I guess I wanted a more mature treatment of the little guy.An example of the plot doing this movie in for me is arguably the most famous scene from this movie: the flying bicycles. The whole movie E.T. has presumably been in great danger of discovery, and is apparently unable to help himself. But when he and the kids are being chased on their bikes, not only is he able to levitate Elliot's bike, but all the rest of them, too! Sorry, but my reaction to that was `Where the HECK did that come from?' (For the record, and so you don't think I'm completely heartless, I do love the image of the bikes in front of the moon).Lastly is John Williams' overpowering score. When I listen to his music as part of a movie, I feel like I'm being hit over the head with a sledgehammer.All right, so I'm an ogre for not liking E.T., and my children will doubtless grow up to be delinquents, but it's the way I feel.  I do think he took the easy way out in creating something with broad appeal: he did it not through character development and growth, but through a series of cute images and gimmicks.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Words cannot describe how much I love this movie!,"ET:The Extra Terrestrial is one of Steven Spielberg's better movies, funny, touching and just wonderful. It not only entertains very young children and their parents but it reaches out to the child within us, that is something I want to feel when I watch a movie from my childhood. I love films like Beauty and the Beast, The Wizard of Oz, Mary Poppins and The NeverEnding Story for exactly that reason. The film is beautifully filmed, with breathtaking cinematography and beautiful scenery. The scene with ET and Elliot on the bicycle is just an amazing scene, I think John Williams's amazing score is to thank for that. The special effects are excellent, and the script is funny and touching. There is one sight gag with ET hiding among Elliot's stuffed animal toys that warms my heart every time. The acting is very good, with Henry Thomas appealing as Elliot and Dee Wallace sincere and sensitive as the mother. I also loved Drew Barrymore as the sassy and big-mouthed sister. What makes this film though is ET himself, even with his large eyes and long arms for an alien ET is adorable, sad and sweet. The part when Elliot cries when ET is dying is a real tearjerker, it kills me every time I see this film. Overall, I love this film, it is so special and delightful. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fly him to the moon,"Back in 1982 when ET first came out a patron of the library I work at told me that I HAD TO SEE THIS MOVIE,and to take a box of tissues with me. Bear in mind that this gentleman was a very urbane,if somewhat cynical college professor. Not the type I would have expected to recommend a film so highly.  I took his advise. THANK YOU HOWARD. Next to ""The day the earth stood still"" ET ranks as my favorite sci-fi film of all time. The newly inhanced version is excellent too.  Henry Thomas is delightful and the middle child ,Elliott who find and befriends ET. He is not ""too cute"",but gives a terrific performance,especially when ET telepathically makes him drunk.The end of the movie still makes me cry,maybe not a whole box of tissues worth by now,but there is just something about ET and Elliott's good bye that tears me up.The two principle adults, Dee Wallace(Stone) and Peter Coyote are good too.  Coyote, who is only known as ""Keys"" is in some respects almost as innocent as Elliott, and you wish that he had been able to have more contact with ET.  Although the scenes where the house is being sealed off is frightening, it still works. The scene where Elliot and his brother steal the van is priceless when older brother comes out with the memorable line ""I've never driven forward before!""

E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial is A Classic For The Ages!,"E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, Steven Spielberg's timeless ode to all the loners of the world, finds him at his most pure. The storyline of E.T. is a relatively simple one: Ten-year-old Elliott (Henry Thomas, who never resorts to that ""oh-look-at-how-precious-I-am"" shtick but makes you root for him through his incredible performance), who lives with his mom and two siblings, meets a wizened little geezer who turns out to be a visitor from another planet. E.T., owing to his overtly curious streak, is abandoned by his pot-bellied otherworldly pals as he misses his ride back home. He now has to cope on Earth until they can come back and rescue him. Being a friendly extraterrestrial ambassador, Elliott and E.T. soon form a special bond and Elliott, with help from his siblings, helps E.T. find a way home. And soon the magic unfolds! Along the way there are moments of humor as E.T. makes discoveries about this world and the children learn things about him; moments of sadness when E.T. becomes deathly ill and is captured by the scientists; and a thrilling chase sequence that will have you cheering along. When Elliott and his friends soar on their bicycles against a gigantic moon, it's as touching and note-perfect a moment as any in the movies.Spielberg's 'lovable-space-creature-slums-it-in-suburbia' movie is one of the greatest achievements in imagination ever put on film. The simplicity of the narrative and the ingeniousness of the E.T. character create a powerful combination. The genius and wonder of E.T. is that Spielberg creates a character that is obviously not real. However, he draws the audience in so well that you care for him as much as you do for the children. What the movie does so well is to capture that moment in life when childhood seems to be slipping away. This is a wondrous evocation of that time in our lives when brothers and sisters were necessary co-conspirators, bikes were our ticket to freedom and we were willing to believe that a friendly little alien could really appear from the backyard shed. While doing so, Spielberg manages not only to entertain young children but also reach out to the child in all of us, never failing to strum the heartstrings.Many have hailed E.T. as a bona-fide sci-fi classic. For me, it is a heart and soul movie that just happens to have a sci-fi angle. And you know what? You're sure going to need a box of tissues!",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A little too sappy for my tastes,"I've watched quit a few movies that made me sob. But ""E.T."" is a little extreme. It's a great movie, and there are some great actors. The plot is very touching. Steven Speilberg is practically the ""boss"" of directing. He knows what he is doing and he does it well. He has a vision that makes everyone smile. He's brilliant. But this time he went a little far. In fact, I am almost crying writing a comment on the movie becaue I am thinking about the ending. I'm sorry, I just can't say this is the best movie. It's way too sad for me. But I will say that it was a great movie if anything. I would recommend for youngsters though.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
E.T. = exceptionally tremendous,"If it wasn't for all of the babies crying in the theater, the reissue of this great movie would have been a better experience. While some will call ET nothing more than a sappy kid's movie, I feel this film brings much more to the table. The compassion, the acceptance, and the eventual paranoia surrounding ET made this film something to enjoy. With the remastered soundtrack, the experience proved to be even more breathtaking, adding more power and magistry to a film I thoroughly enjoyed as a kid. However, some of the remastered special effects were unnecessary,  especially the guns- turned-walkie talkies effect Spielberg employed. I mean, what stubborn, rebellious kid is going to be afraid of walkie talkies? They should have just kept the guns. When this one comes out on DVD, I'll just pretend the special edition never happened.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Better than I remembered, but still overrated.","I haven't seen this film since the late eighties at least, perhaps not since around the time it came out. And I must admit it was better than I expected. I didn't watch the new remastered director's cut that just came out recently, but instead borrowed the original, to see it as it was (I'm not really interested in cut scenes, etc.)The effects were vintage ILM, very nice for the time. E.T. looks pretty impressive, even by today's standards it isn't at all bad. Drew Barrymore is adorable, and I liked the older brother. In fact, Elliott is the only character that annoys me, with his shrieking and whining constantly...I admit, I'm fairly prejudiced against anyone younger than 14 in a film (as I rarely see any character at that age that isn't nauseatingly precious or irritating as heck) and this kid was no exception.Scenes that stood out in my mind include the wonderful frog rescue scene, and the classic bike rides (especially the chase one). But unfortunately, I feel the film drags on much too long, and the entire illness stretch just seems to go on forever. The government agents also seem rather unbelievable as well as overly inept and less covert thatn I think they should be. Though this is a children's film, so some silliness and suspension of disbelief is necessary. Still, as a whole I think the film is overrated. Great for kids (though not too young - I can see young children easily frightened by certain scenes), and heartwarming, some cool effects and a message for all about friendship and loyalty is strongly apparent. But still, a bit too silly at times, and the length gets tedious a bit towards the end. Great to watch, but I don't think it's the masterpiece many claim it to be. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An unforgettable experience.,"E. T. the Extra-Terrestrial tells the story of Elliott(Henry Thomas). Elliott needs to help a friendly alien who's marooned on Earth, return to his home world.E. T. The Extra-Terrestrial is an awe-inspiring film. Director Steven Spielberg has knocked it out of the park, with this movie. No wonder it's one of his most iconic films & the logo of his production company. This is my review of the IMAX re-release on its 40th anniversary. The set pieces are mind-blowing. There are so many scenes that will tug at your heartstrings. The visual & practical effects are fantastic. The titular character is adorable & hilarious. The background score by John Williams is iconic. Henry Thomas is spectacular as Elliott. Drew Barrymore is brilliant as Gertie. Dee Wallace is perfect as Mary. Robert MacNaughton is awesome as Michael. E. T. The Extra Terrestrial is a must watch in IMAX for all the die-hard fans of this movie. While E.

Still Wonderfully Uncynical,"It's not exactly groundbreaking to say that very few people have had the influence on global pop culture that Spielberg has; this film is one of the key foundation posts on which that remarkable legacy is built. 40 years on, there are a few things I notice: a wonderfully uncynical sweetness that is much less saccharine than you remember; that it's still genuinely funny and playful; that it's a really good story about childhood and especially Spielberg's signature theme of absent fathers; how skilfully Spielberg uses familiar tropes from the horror genre and inverts them to comedy whilst still remaining just frightening enough for a movie aimed to work for all ages (and unusually, working for all those ages). It would be easy, but empty, to be cooly cynical about this film now, but why do so when the result is so life-enhancing? It's not as if the film is without fear, darkness, and sadness either - it simply remains a masterful mix of tones that it's hard to imagine anyone else pulling off so successfully.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
My #11 favorite film of all time,"What a thrilling joy E.T. was when I was a kid. And what a trilling joy it still is. What an intriguing concept, to make an alien from another planet befriend children from Earth. At first the encounter is extremely tentative then by the end becomes a great friendship.What an exhilarating score from John Williams. Probably the best composer in film history, this ranks as one of his best. The music dances and flows with the images on the screen with sweeping majesty. It ranges from the foreboding to the thrilling.In my personal opinion this is Spielberg's best. He said he would never make a sequel to E.T. because it is too close to his heart.

Where's a Xenomorph when you need it?,"Plot: A small alien creature is accidentally left on earth by its own kind and must now survive and find a way to get back home.By all means I'm not biased against this movie. I've only seen it two times in my life. #1 when I was 7 years old where I cried like a wuss in the finale and #2 Now, in my thirties where I try figuring out whether this movie sucks or the child in me is dead. However, despite my age and my ZERO memories of the movie I had no false expectations. I didn't expect a dark sci-fi tale, I didn't expect logic, I didn't expect breathtaking action of any sort. What I DID expect was a cute, funny and somewhat sugary 80's kiddy fairy tale about a boy and his new alien friend. So what went wrong? The movie starts and we wait, and we wait, and we wait. Then a glimpse of the alien! Then we wait and wait and wait while the boy tries meeting him. Then we wait and wait and wait while the boy tries communicating with the alien. NOW we wait and wait and wait while the ALIEN tries to communicate with the boy. And in about an hour the EVIL ADULTS come forth and take the alien thus starts the quest to save it. Still awake? Still interested to watch this ""classic""? Well if the awful pacing of the movie isn't something bad for you the lack of any entertainment value and the overdose of cuteness will do the trick.The movie simply isn't fun. The humor is okay for a movie of its kind but I can only remember 2 or 3 mildly fun scenes in the film and they aren't exactly ""classic"" material. The characters are boring and way too cute and politically correct for my tastes. It's your classic ""Awwwwww"" movie and I can handle a certain amount of cuteness alright, (I've seen ALL Disney animation films), but this movie went overboard. Each scene which involves the 3 kids and the alien, (especially when Drew is around), all you see is kids with their mouths wide open, (the Spielberg look like a reviewer cleverly commented), then the alien does something ""funny"" or full of sensitivity and Awwwwww or if you are like me ARRRGGGH!!! Well I'm 29 years old and I did shed a tear with Toy Story 3. I did laugh my ass with Back to The Future and I enjoyed the similarly dumb Gremlins. While watching E.T. I could see the strings that Spielberg tried to pull with my bare eyes. I'm sure he masterfully managed to manipulate a lot of 5-9 year olds into loving this crap but honestly how on earth did this film managed to become such a huge phenomenon???

The Film is an Experience... of Crying and Emotions.,"I was just unaware of anything with which the Film's past is related i.e. copied from the Alien, when I watched the movie.
I just heard the movie's name for the First time and when it was from Steven, ears preaked somewhat up, and when saw it is LIKE the movie ""Koi mil gaya"", a Bollywood movie which I loved, ears finally preaked up.And I just saw today.
First, the thing that I most loved before watching the movie, is the Poster.
This movie's poster in which Human and the Alien's fingers are getting touched is shown and in the second one in which the Kid riding on the bike and the silhouette of them are being shown by the moon behind, was great ( I am feeling that I have seen such thing somewhere )But about the Movie, I was tied with it.
Has Steven got something called 'Emotions' in his every movies ?
I felt the same when I watched his A.I. movie. ( Again the Abbreviation ! )But in this movie, I literally cried.
I literally cried.
Yes, I'm not a kid who enjoys the movie and cries when something sad happens in the movie but being an adult, I just cried.
The team has beautifully shot those scenes when the researchers are trying to discover from the alien's body.
The whole sequence maybe lasts long for about 20 mins and I cried 20 mins.Very beautifully shot those scenes - But when they stopped my from crying was when the boy opens up the cabin, and the alien laughs and says - ""Please Phone Home "" , yes that was very expected that the makers will not leave the movie in this way and the alien was supposed to get up, but in the way the alien (Sorry E.T.) shouted and told was very hitting moment.Some other factors :Hey, wait, was E.T. a 3-D model ? ( Obviously, But how realistic in that time !! )Flying VFX shots ( Ok, can't say !! )But whatever you say, this movie has something to say.

The greatest live action family movie EVER.,"But, It's more than just that. Spielberg perfectly combined the magic of childhood with the magic of 70's/80's science fiction. The result: pure 80's pop poetry. Perhaps like no other film, this film completely captures what it was like to be a child in 1980's American Suburbia; I should know- being the same age as Drew Barrymore. For many, it's too sentimental (as if that was a deadly sin.) Maybe that's why ET gets no respect in the 21st century. Spielberg's other magic sci-fi masterpiece from the period(Close Encounters) receives the same lack of respect. It's also a hopeful film that is meant to awe, not scare or depress. Have we become so cynical in the last twenty years that we seriously consider movies(as good as they may be) like Trainspotting and Heat to be superior to two of Spielberg's best?

More magical than Harry Potter,"E.T. the Extra Terrestrial is a magical film and one of the best movies Steven Spielberg has made. The acting is tremendous all- around. The kid acting is especially great. Drew Barrymore and Henry Thomas's performances are probably some of the best kid acting ever in a movie. Really the only other great kid actor I can think of is Haley Joel Osment for roles in The Sixth Sense, A.I. Artificial Intelligence, and many others. Everything you could want in a good family Spielberg movie is in E.T. There's great acting, smart writing, beautiful use of cinematography, good lighting with Spielberg's famous shadow work, an amazing musical score by John Williams, and, of course, there is plenty of memorable moments and what is often referred to today as the ""Spielberg magic"". The whole movie is a masterpiece, but I did find a few flaws that I tried to overlook but couldn't because they just brought down my enjoyment of the film too much. The first few minutes of the movie are really slow. There isn't dialogue for at least about five minutes in the film. Many people would say that that's a certain style that benefits the film. I wanted the movie to get to the point a little bit quicker, and I think the slightly longer exposition didn't help.

I was alienated and alone at times, seeking my own identity that little boys often find in their dads.

Like I said earlier, its plot seems to be pretty simple, way more than anything like Star Wars. There's not a lot of lore behind E. T. at all. He's simply an alien that found its way to Earth and tries to get back home. With that, it seems good to show younger children and would recommend to anyone who don't like anything being part of a big franchise. With it releasing in 1981, there's nothing like the over the top CGI like there is in modern day Marvel movies. With that, I felt that they did a good job at portraying E.

Revisiting a Timeless Classic: E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial,"E. T. The Extra-Terrestrial, a hallmark of 1982 cinema, stands as a testament to the era's inventive spirit. While not necessarily ahead of its time, considering the myriad of vintage sci-fi flicks that graced black-and-white screens with zombies and various creatures, E. T. brought something refreshingly novel to the table. This film managed to capture the audience's imagination in a way that few others did, weaving a tale of friendship and adventure that resonated deeply.Over the years, opinions on whether E. T. has aged gracefully vary, but its status as an iconic piece of cinematic history is undeniable. It may not hold up against the high-definition, CGI-laden films of today in terms of visuals, but the heart of the story-the emotional connection between a young boy and a lost alien-remains as powerful as ever.For lovers of cinema, E. T. The Extra-Terrestrial is more than just a movie; it's a piece of nostalgia, a slice of the '80s that reminds us of the power of storytelling. Whether you're revisiting this classic or experiencing its magic for the first time, E. T. offers a journey back to a simpler time in filmmaking, where the bond of friendship could transcend worlds. So light up your love for cinema, and give E. T. a watch-because some classics never fade. 🚬",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The happiness and heartbreak of childhood,"When it first appeared in 1982, director Spielberg's family-friendly ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"" was immediately hailed by critics as the '80s equivalent of ""The Wizard of Oz"" (which put me on the defensive). However, his technical wizardry here is undeniable, turning full-bodied puppetry into a lifelike alien being capable of warming the sternest of hearts (you'd have to be a real cynic not to be choked up by the finale). Screenwriter Melissa Mathison has dreamed up a beautiful suburban scenario in which a youngster (Henry Thomas, who has a lovely, sleepy gaze) and his two siblings befriend an alien creature inexplicably left behind by his own people on a fast visit to Earth. Spielberg knows intuitively how to set up this story visually, and he wrings laughs and excitement from even the hoariest of circumstances. I didn't quite understand the spiritual (or psychic) link that suddenly develops between Thomas' Elliott and E.T., but one accepts it (just as one accepts the kids who still peddle their bicycles even after they are magically aloft above the town). Spielberg is surely in touch with the feelings and responses of children (those on-camera and in the audience), which leaves the adults--mom Dee Wallace in particular--pretty much out of the party. Still, it's a briskly-paced, imaginative ode to innocence.

A young boy named Elliot (Henry Thomas) has found an alien and almost right from the start they have an especially deep connection. Elliot finds that he must assist his new friend and try to send him back to his own planet.Amazing direction and storytelling mixed with great visuals and interesting sounds. John Williams also has a fabulous score that really belongs among the conversation about the best movie scores of all time. ET won four Oscars including Sound, Visual Effects, Sound Effects Editing and Music. Carlo Rambaldi as well gets a big thumbs up from me as he grabbed an Oscar for his work on ET. He had previously a few years earlier had worked on Ridley Scott's ALIEN and did work on the head of that alien. Two very different aliens though. The effects of the alien in this film are great and kids should love it.This film also was not just a little influential for the TV show STRANGER THINGS. ET was a monster of a flowing river of inspiration to that show. When it came out it was the highest-grossing film of all time until Spielberg outdid himself in 1993 with JURASSIC PARK.The acting in this film is great as well especially from the kids. Elliot has two siblings in Michael (Robert McNaughton) and Gertie (Drew Barrymore). It is to me through these three kids that the film must be carried when ET is off screen. They do a great job and bring quite believable performances. Also starring Dee Wallace as their mom, Peter Coyote and C. Thomas Howell in his film debut.On a final note I also owned the Atari game ET when I was a kid. Sorry, but awesome film, terrible game. It was one of the most frustratingly bad games I had ever played. Whenever I played the game it was out of the console within five minutes so that I could play a much better game like SPACE INVADERS.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A modern day fairy tale that's about as perfect as you can get, even in spite of its proliferation in pop culture osmosis and scores of imitators","In small suburban town in Northern California, a young boy named Elliott (Henry Thomas) is scared by the sight of a strange creature, but is met with skepticism by his mother Mary (Dee Wallace), older brother Michael (Robert MacNaughton) and younger sister Gertie (Drew Barrymore). Eventually finding the creature and discovering the creature is friendly in nature, Elliott hides him in his home and gradually introduces him to Gertie and Michael while keeping him a secret. As they learn to communicate with the creature. Whom they come to know as ""E. T."", they attempt to find a way to get him home as government agents lead by ""Keys"" (Peter Coyote) search for him.E. T. Is a 1982 science fantasy film that is arguably the most famous and iconic of Stephen Spielberg's filmography. Initially developed at Columbia Pictures as a potential follow-up to Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind as darker project called Night Skies written by John Sayles, feelings of loneliness while filming Raiders of the Lost Ark in Tunisia made Spielberg revisit memories of an imaginary alien friend he'd had as a child which he built from a subplot from the aborted Night Skies which was then adapted by Melissa Mathison. Columbia rather famously chose not to make E. T. which led Spielberg to use his connections at Universal to persuade them to pick up the film while still giving Columbia 5% of the film's profits. The film was a massive hit where following massively successful previews in Texas which culminated with a successful number one opening weekend that saw the film fluctuate between first and second place from June through October of that year. Critical reception was also positive with many critics even hailing the film as one of the best of the year and even scoring several Academy Award nominations including Best Picture which it lost to Gandhi, but it did win for John Williams' score as well as sound and film editing and visual effects. E. T. Is one of those movies that is so hyped up and so ubiquitous in pop culture references that even people who haven't seen the movie know what happens in it. And yet, even knowing all that I can't deny it holds up.Much like films such as The Wizard of Oz, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, or Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, E. T. is a film that plays to the emotions of its audience more than it does to logic or machinations of the plot. That's not to say the movie is overly simple, far from it. But the actual nuts and bolts of the story aren't the primary focus as instead the focus is on the development of the characters, this family and what motivates them. Even if E. T. were to be taken out of this story, there's a strong underlying core in the dynamic of Elliott's family with Dee Wallace's quietly sad turn as Mary who is handling raising three children and a recent separation from her husband as best she can while feeling the weight, Drew Barrymore's innocent naivety that in lesser hands could've become grating but is put to use in a clever balanced way, Robert MacNaughton's Michael who possesses a more cynical streak while also bearing more responsibility than someone his age should deal with, and of course Elliott himself who possesses a strong intelligence but not a high level of emotional maturity. With the inclusion of E. T., especially since they establish him as being empathic in nature, he provides an arc for Elliott in tapping into those emotions of empathy which is a key factor in what makes this movie work on a purely emotional level. I'll admit, I've put off seeing this movie for years because years of cultural osmosis and viewings of various films inspired or ""cloned"" from E. T. left me uninterested in this film because I'd been convinced I'd already seen it. In hindsight that really wasn't a fair assessment because even if the story is a familiar one it's not always the story that sucks in the viewer but rather the small details we take for granted, the style and presentation that create mood and atmosphere, and on a purely visual level E. T. possesses a level of visual poetry few of its imitators have managed to capture (if at all).In an age where it's increasingly easy to fall into mindsets and philosophical leanings of nihilism, cynicism, and pessimism, that environment has left many of these oft quoted and referenced films seen in hindsight as ""hokey"", ""naive"", and whatever other adjectives that are used to denigrate standings that run counter to an allegedly more ""grounded"" outlook. But even if you think you've seen it already, you should try to see it unburdened by those bleak or dire thoughts and appreciate the film for what it is: a fairy tale in a contemporary setting.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Magic and joy on film. Period.,"E. T. the Extra-Terrestrial is one of those films that just doesn't lose its effect on me. I can and have seen it countless times since I saw it in 1982 and still feel that it is a perfect film. Over the years it has become sort of an anachronistic film to.many. Kids these days are jaded by CGI laden film franchises and maybe don't appreciate this simple but heartfelt film about a visitor from outer space that befriends a young boy named Elliot. The greatest thing about this film is that it is told from a kids' point of view. Elliot is played by Henry Thomas in what I think is the best child performance in a film ever. But all the performances of the young actors are virtually flawless. Robert MacNaughton is Elliot's brother David and Drew Barrymore steals every scene as hus 5 year old sister Gertie. To me there us no other director that directs children better than Steven Spielberg. He gets such natural, thoughtful and real performances.The film takes place in suburbia. The three kids living with their mother Mary played beautifully by Dee Wallace. She recently divorced from her husband and they are dealing with adjusting to a new life without him. We see alien botanists gathering specimens when one of the aliens wanders off to explore and when government agents arrive and chase him the rest of the aliens flee in their spaceship and leave the creature alone on Earth. Elliot finds the creature and takes him in. He hows his brother and sister the creature and at first they freak out but soon they develop a love for E. T. But of course the central relationship between Elliot and E. T. and it is wonderful. They have a connection that is loving and deep. Elliot and E. T. are so connected tgat Elliot feels what E. T. is feeling. Of course we have tge government agents that are searching for the creature but we never see their faces. Only one character's keys are shown. Later we meet him and the character is played by Peter Coyote but his name in the credits is just Keys. The whole second act of the film is just perfect. There is such a sense of wonder and healing that E. T. brings to Elliot because he was dealing with his parent's divorce.The film might be considered a science fiction fantasy but it is much more in my opinion. It's about family and about healing. E. T. Earns every laugh. Ever tear and has such a great sense of magic and joy. That's a rarity in films today.It's a beautiful film.Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Timeless childhood movie!!!!,"Please ignore the killjoys here that are reviewing and saying this is a bad movie; they clearly have no concept of legendary storytelling or creativity and should be quiet. One such reviewer said this was copied from 'Mac and Me'. All it takes is two minutes to do your research and to the person that posted that - don't spread false info. Mac and Me was released in 1988 and was a blatant rip off of E. T.This movie is a true masterpiece. I first saw it back in 1994 and it stuck with me since then. I miss those times terribly, however I can imagine how amazing it would have been to see it in cinemas back then! It is one of the best films ever created accompanied by one of the best soundtracks to ever be recorded. It is charming, funny and tear-jerking and the plot is straight to the point with each scene executed beautifully! This movie is a must watch and an all time-classic.

"If you don't like this film, then something is wrong with you.","I hate you Steven Speilberg.You're one of the few directors who can make a movie that after all of these years, still makes me cry.E.T. is a true classic that stands the test of time. It's a movie about a boy who's parents are divorced, and befriends a loveable alien who is lost after his family leave without him. Both go through a change in each other's personality and life, as the boy (Named Elliot.) must learn to share his new friend with others, while making sure his Mother (Played EXCELLENTLY by Dee Wallace Stone, as usual when she acts in films.) doesen't know that he is keeping that special alien with him. Sure, there are some disturbing scenes, but the good outweighs the bad here. When this came out, I was only 4 years old, and it has truly affected me. I was amazed by this film when I was young, and still am now. To me, this is the greatest film of all time.Yes, I like this more than Star Wars, The Godfather, Titanic, and other films that have achieved greatness. Why? Because it affected me in such a way back then, and still does now-a-days.I still cry when I watch this movie. I'll admit it. I still cry.

Super-schmaltzy Spielberg sci-fi.,"Nearly 25 years ago, Steven Spielberg gave us this hugely successful blockbuster about a boy who befriends an alien stranded on Earth. As a fourteen year old, I lapped it up and thought the film was brilliant. A quarter of a century later, how does the film stand up to the test of time?Not as well as I had hoped, actually, it being one of Spelberg's most schmaltzy and saccharine movies ever, with several scenes feeling more than a little contrived. To this now older and wiser viewer, the film feels less magical than I originally thought it was.Spielberg gets great performances from his cast (particularly from some of the younger, less experienced ones on whom the film heavily relies) and delivers plenty of iconic moments, but parts of the film tend to drag whilst, if you analyse the movie enough, other moments make little sense. Only Spielberg's ability to expertly manipulate his audience allows him to get away with some otherwise unforgivable 'plot devices'.I don't wish to dwell on these 'niggles', suffice to say that it's hard to believe that a superior intelligence would allow itself to be stranded in the first place, and that a creature able to communicate telepathically and make objects fly would need to rely on a 10 year old boy for help.Those that are less pedantic than I will undoubtedly have a great time, but the more I think about the film, the less I like it. If you saw it as a child and loved it, my advice is not to watch it againyou may come away disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It was a sappy mess and should be banned.I was duped into believing that this was the next sci-fi classic, perhaps another Star Wars. I sure missed the mark on this one.I should have asked for a refund. Steven Spielberg should be ashamed of himself for putting out this piece of garbage.

I should be in the nines!,"Firstly, I cant believe that poor old E.T. isn't getting a better showing in the rankings than the high sevens - its a beautiful gem of a film and deserves to be at least a high eight.Anyway, this is one of those films made by Spielberg that helps to cement his status as the premiere fairy tale teller of all (film) time.The simple premise that not all aliens want to rip out our spines of lay chest bursters inside us a kill all our friends is a concept that has not been returned to since (apart from the dismal Cocoon).This is probably because nobody will ever be able to recreate the intense emotional journey that Spielberg has portrayed.  THe heart wrenching scenes between Elliot and E.T. at the end of the film will go to prove the exqisitely realised genuinity of the love and friendship that develops and actually exists (I mean that Henry Thomas - ELiiot - came to love the puppet as if he were real) is what makes everything in life worth it.Full of warm moments, clever touches and humour, E.T. is an absolutely essential watch for all fim fans.Timeless. 9/10",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A perfect reflection on childhood, adulthood, and the fears mortality","With Summer fast approaching, and nostalgia always in the media zeitgeist, I always find myself returning to the masterful works of directors in the 80s. Sure, it is usually out of a desperate want to return to the age of innocence, a time of playing tag with the neighborhood friends, or racing bikes down the street with cards taped to the wheels. But the days are far gone or slipping further and further away. So, I turn to Spielberg or Carpenter or Donner (the list goes on, of course). And nothing so eloquently plays with childhood discovery and the pressure of adulthood better than E.T. If you haven't seen it, or you remember it as a kids film, be sure to revisit it sometime soon. It is truly a director working at their own peak.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
For the child in us all,"Nostalgia can be a popular emotion, blinding us to flaws that are otherwise quite obvious. With 'E.T.' there's certainly nostalgia there for me, but what makes it different is that it makes me feel like I'm 8 years old again.Every element of this film is truly sensational. You're unlikely to ever find a cast of children who are the equal of the youngsters here. The direction by Steven Spielberg is--no pun intended--light years ahead of the many copycats who followed. Oh, and then there's the score by John Williams. If it doesn't give you goose bumps, there's a good chance you are dead.With laughs, thrills and a huge heart, 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' is a classic for the ages.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A wonderful family movie,"When Elliot hears strange noises from his garden shed he finds an alien there - left behind when it's craft had to leave early.  He brings `ET' into the house and shows his siblings, who help ET feel at home and settled. However ET begins to plan a way to signal back home to get picked up, meanwhile Elliot and ET start to have their feelings join up.Be honest - there must be very few people do at very least don't have a lump in there throats at some point during this film.  The plot is a simple tale of an alien who befriends a young boy however it is told with such pathos and wit that it is very hard not to love it.  Here is an example that shows that Spielberg can actually make a sweet film without totally killing it with syrupy sentiment - although that's not to say that he doesn't cut it very fine at times here.  ET is an ugly little beast but he easily wins over an audience.  His link to Elliot is never totally explained but it is well used, whether it's in the classroom scene or the touching scene near the end.The film has a real wit to it that is never hilarious but sits very well with the gentle emotion of the film.  Most of the reason lies with the cast. This is seen in the fact that in the 20th anniversary version of the film, several scenes were added with a cgi ET - they mostly added humour but didn't totally work because it is the very talented child cast that makes it work.Thomas' Elliot is cute but not to the sickly point, he is sassy and smart (but again not to the point of being annoying).  Barrymore does all the stuff she does now - little smirk and smart mouth!  But she is really good and I wish more child actors could be as fun and natural as she was here. Ironically it is the eldest of the three children that is the weakest - he is a teenager and falls to the surely side, he is quite wooden for too much of the film.  However it is ET who is the star of the film and, watching it as an adult now, it is amazing how expressive he is for a puppet - he may not look like much when viewed alongside modern cgi characters (ie Gollum) but he is very expressive and very much a character rather than an effect; Barrymore was not the only one to be taken in by him as a real character! In fact the cgi ET looks weaker if anything because he does look like an effect first and a character second; it's hard to describe but the puppet works better because he is in the scenes whereas the effect has clearly been added later.Overall though this is a wonderful film that I saw as a child in a bingo hall cinema and loved and watch as an adult now and love.  There is really very little that is wrong with it and Spielberg holds back the syrup for only a few scenes that are emotional enough to justify it.  The cast of children show, where later Spielberg films don't, that child actors don't need to be horribly cutest kids that bare no resemblance to real life, and they create a real sense of audience involvement and identification as well as emotion and wit.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Should have seen it as a kid.,"Even as a kid I thought this movie looked dumb. Lo and behild hearing all these adults rave about how it's such a good movie... It's not. If Spielberg didn't make Jaws, I am confident this movie would have sunk. It would be unwatchable if it weren't for the actor who played Elliot. He's the only thing that makes the movie feel real. I know it's 2021, but how did ANYONE think that E. T. puppet looked good? John Carpenter's the Thing had way better special effects for less money and a year prior. I know this is a kids movie but still... Doesn't hold up at all.

Do people still talk on the phone?,"E. T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982) -I've never actually understood all the fuss about this film. I just don't think that it was as much of an adventure as it could have been and I'm not sure that the latest generations would really appreciate it for it's more basic and less action packed nature, as far as adventure films go.I mean it was a cute work and it had its charms, but it just lacked enough excitement to keep me glued to it as much as similar productions from around the same time - 'Star Wars: A New Hope' (1977) 'The Goonies' (1985) 'Raiders Of The Lost Ark -Indiana Jones' (1981) 'Back To The Future' (1985) and 'Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan' (1982). Even 'Explorers' (1985) was a more fun experience for me.I will admit that this particular Extra Terrestrial will always have a nostalgic place in my heart, as it brings back the first time I ever watched a video cassette, which was at my Aunties house and also seems to be my first recollection of eating a cookie. Being younger at the time and also the age the film was aimed at, I'm sure I enjoyed it at the time, as much for the novelty of the VHS as the fun little alien (And the Cookies), so what I'm trying to say is that I don't think that it had/has the longevity to stand the test of time as much as those others listed above and while my age group move on and the next assortment of youths get stuck to their phones watching reels and TikTok's instead. They're more likely to see a meme using a clip from the film than to actually sit down and watch it all the way through and that is where this one will be lost, because the same sort of story has since been done over and over again, often in a better way and in a more captivating and engaging way for the generation of cell phone video watchers and the other films listed are already popular within that groups culture, as the franchises had that staying power and some the ability to reinvent themselves continually. In my opinion this one will just be remembered for the funny little man with the light up finger and the flying bikes, but not for any depth in the story or emotional connection to the film itself. It certainly doesn't evoke any attachment from me, as 'Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back' (1980) of the 'Indiana Jones' sequels do.However, I did feel like I understood the heart of it a bit more this time around.It did have a certain powerful essence to it, especially with regards to the scene when all the doctors get involved and what follows, but that seemed to be something that I could only really appreciate as an adult and not necessarily what I remembered about it from the first few times I had watched it when I was younger.And similarly, I'd never paid attention to the fact that E. T. and the crew of his ship were a Gardeners/Botanists before. But watching this film in adulthood it was really quite clear that his peoples purpose on Earth was to gather horticultural life and take it back to their own planet, something that had been entirely lost on me previously.With regards to the cast, Elliot played by Henry Thomas had the most annoying voice and someone should definitely call social services about his neglectful Mother (Dee Wallace).Drew Barrymore was very good in her role of Gertie though, especially at such a young age.John Williams' scored another success with his soundtrack too. It will always give me goosebumps, especially the bit with the bike and was perhaps my favourite thing about the whole film.Other than that I thought that the government agents were a bit too terrifying as well, in that they were so extreme and over the top and I'm pretty sure that they must have repeatedly breached the families rights in the invasion of their home. I'd freak out if they turned up on my doorstep in spacesuits with guns and strange medical equipment. By the end of it all I would need would be a straight jacket.So to summarise, I'm being a bit of a Libra with this review, it was good, but had room for improvement too. I know that many consider it a classic and a huge part of their childhoods, which I obviously do as well, but I wondered how much it would stand up against the likes of the 'Spider-Man' and other Marvel franchises, 'The Hunger Games' and 'Harry Potter' films and so on, in keeping the attention of newcomers to the story.It was quite long for a story aimed at fidgety and restless kids and it didn't necessarily have enough going on, with a lot of scene setting and establishing scenes before anything really exciting happened.I will of course watch it again and perhaps with another viewing I might see what has interested so many others all this time with more clarity, however I will probably watch 'Star Wars' and 'The Goonies' a lot more often in the mean time for the fact that they have always entertained me a lot more.I'll wait for the comments to roll in.690.11/1000.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It's Not That Good,"In terms of box office bucks this was the most successful film ever . It might have made even more if it wasn't for the fact that a lot of people including myself hadn't watched it on pirate video in 1983 . In truth I don't think it deserved to set the universe alight because of its premise ET starts with a spaceship landing in a desolate woodland one dark night . Now spaceships landing in desolate woodlands on a dark night mean only one thing , if you've seen an episode of THE OUTER LIMITS or DOCTOR WHO or UFO it means trouble for humanity with the human race losing some brave warriors at the very least . You see the problem ? The narrative has just started and already we know nothing horrible is going to happen . This is not what alien landings are about , there not about monsters with extendable necks being vulnarable - They're about carnage , gunfire , explosions and lines like "" We can't hold them sir ""If anyone thinks I'm missing the point let me say this: Spielberg's first movie was a pseudo horror movie called DUEL a fairly effective thriller ( Casting aside ) about a man driving through desert wilderness . Spielberg then made SOMETHING EVIL a chilling horror film and then made JAWS another legendary quasi horror movie with a monster that exits in reality a great white shark . JURASSIC PARK is to all intents a horror movie , and I bet the upcoming WAR OF THE WORLDS will get a few pulses racing . In other words Spielberg despite his flaws can make an audiences heart leap out of their mouth but his main flaw is that he all too easily drowns an audience in gooey sentimentality . THE TERMINAL suffered from this and so did parts of SCHINDLER'S LIST and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN , and without doubt ET is the best example of Spielberg's sugary sentiment suffocating a story , not that there was much of a story to start with . And I haven't even mentioned the all American kids or the ridiculous flying bikes sequence or the terrible John Williams score . The only significance ET has in my life is that it introduced me to the words "" Geek "" "" Wimp "" and "" Douce-bag "" and that I had to watch nearly every sci-fi movie of the mid to late 1980s revolve around a plot of a cute alien being adopted by a child .

E.T. The Extra Terrestrial is the epitome of 80s family adventure.,"Consistently referenced in modern day films, a pop cultural phenomenon and rated highly as one of Spielberg's best. Unsurprisingly, I can see why! It has stood the test of time. A young boy encounters a small alien who is accidentally left on Earth. He decides to keep the alien and assist it in contacting its home so that it can return safely with its race. Think of E.T. as an sci-fi symphony. Spielberg is the maestro, waving his camera around succinctly to create a visual narrative. Each section of the orchestra is an emotion. We've got happiness, laughter, bewilderment and even sadness. Spielberg unites these feelings to create a melodic film that encompasses each emotion perfectly. I still do believe he is one of the best directors for this very reason. He is a visionary master. If he wants to make a family adventure that all audiences can enjoy, well...he's going to. And he does so consistently well. He is able to embed themes of maturity, friendship and motherhood to enhance the meaning behind the glorious practical effects. The telepathic connection between E.T. and Elliott enables Spielberg to harness imagination and utilise it for creative control. Extremely effective towards the end where illness befalls, to which I'm sure will bring a tear to your eye. The acting was consistently good, especially from the child actors. Liked how the story was told through Elliott's perspective, to which the majority of adults are hidden from view. John Williams' score once again accompanies Spielberg's vision and complements the film euphorically to create some memorable pieces of music, such as the moment Elliott's bicycle soars through the night sky. Because I'm late to the E.T. party, I have seen very similar films so I was not as astounded as one may have been back in 1982. Nostalgia definitely plays a big part in the acclaim for E.T. however, it's a competently made family blockbuster that may seem small in scale but will deliver big emotions.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
When Dumber Films Are Made...,"This is the most intellectually offensive big-budget science fiction movie I've ever seen. I write science fiction for a living (check the bookstores), and if I ever tried to get away with this kind of drivel, I'd be out of work. Example: E.T. can levitate -- but if he levitates to reach his ship at the start of the movie we have no movie, so he only seems able to levitate after he's been left behind. Example: The mother walks through a kitchen strewn with empty beer cans and doesn't notice them. What mother of a teen-aged kid (or younger) would do that? Example: E.T. dies for no known reason, and then comes back to life, also for no reason. The film is so filled with plot holes and logical flaws, and is so emotionally manipulative, that Spielberg hasn't yet finished paying his penance, even with SCHINDLER'S LIST and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Alien invasion movie that works for children,"(1982) E. T. The Extra Terrestrial
SCIENCE-FICTION/ ADVENTURESimplistic formula has alien accidentally gets lost, ends up going to the Earth. Once there he meets and bonds with children during Halloween, building the most connection with a very young boy, Elliot (Henry Thomas), but as the film gets more interesting as the film progresses which involves(of course) gov't agents. The beginning of this picture almost reminds me of a child finding a small turtle or a mouse, and then brings it home without telling the parents! A very young Drew Barrymore also stars in this! An idea that's never shown on screen before probably except on a Star Trek television show influencing other copy cats that came after it especially Super 8, which Spielberg also produced, with a theme of making the alien invader into a sympathetic one since so many older films always portray aliens invading Earth to destroy human kind, such as 1953 ""War Of The Worlds"" , ""1953 It Came From Outer Space"" and "" The Thing (From Another World) to name a few! Very atmospheric with laid back dialogue, but I haven't learned anything more than when I last saw it at the theater.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is a very touching film which took the world by a storm, brilliantly directed by Steven Spielberg, a family film for all ages","E. T. the Extra-Terrestrial is directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Melissa Mathison, whilst Spielberg served as a producer alongside Kathleen Kennedy. The film was an immediate blockbuster, surpassing Star Wars to become the highest-grossing film of all time, a record it held for eleven years until Spielberg's own Jurassic Park surpassed it in 1993. The concept is based on an imaginary friend that Spielberg created after his parents' divorce, thus it makes sense because of the amount of heart poured into this alien, the character E. T. The cast has Henry Thomas as Elliott Taylor, the film also stars Dee Wallace, Peter Coyote, Robert MacNaughton and Drew Barrymore. There were three people who voiced E. T, those being Pat Welsh, Steven Spielberg, and Kayden Green. The actors were mostly young children and honestly, their performances are solid and even quite great yet my expectations weren't that high to begin with. What I liked the most were how they acted like children, that means the writing and direction were top notch which made it easy for the child actors to just be themselves in a way. Simply natural performances.A troubled child summons the courage to help a friendly alien escape from Earth and return to his home planet.The mise-en-scene and how Steven Spielberg set up each shot is just incredible, there are lots of wheels in motion when the camera is running, and the end result is incredible. I wonder how it would have been for the people getting the chance to see it at the cinema, all the excitement and seeing each iconic shot like they were supposed to be seen. Truly extraordinary work. Allen Daviau served as the cinematographer and the film looks incredible, the cooperation between him and Spielberg is seen in every scene. The hovering bicycle scene is an example of memorable shots, something that is known to anyone who hasn't even seen the film. John Williams did the musical score and the film sounds beyond amazing, it sounds spectacular and epic. He is once again worthy of his Oscar. The production design and art direction are incredible in this film too, the visual effects and special effects need some serious praise, especially how they created E. T. Carlo Rambaldi, who designed the aliens for Close Encounters of the Third Kind, was hired to design the animatronics for E. T. It took a cost of $1.5 million and three months time to create the puppet, the head was controlles by puppeteers whilst a child and two ""little people"" took turns in controlling the movement of E. T.E. T. was near-universally acclaimed by critics, and is regarded as one of the greatest films of all time. It received nine nominations at the 55th Academy Awards, winning Best Original Score, Best Visual Effects, Best Sound, and Best Sound Editing in addition to being nominated for Best Picture and Best Director. Gandhi won best picture, but its director, Richard Attenborough, said, ""I was certain that not only would E. T. win, but that it should win. It was inventive, powerful, wonderful. I make more mundane movies."" It also won five Saturn Awards and two Golden Globe Awards. Roger Ebert from Chicago Sun-Times wrote this in his review, ""E. T. The Extra-Terrestrial is a reminder of what movies are for. Most movies are not for any one thing, of course. Some are to make us think, some to make us feel, some to take us away from our problems, some to help us examine them. What is enchanting about 'E. T.' is that, in some measure, it does all of those things.""The film's captivating narrative, memorable characters, and brilliant storytelling have made it a timeless classic. An experience I think every child should have, having seen it as an adult I really understand why my father wanted me to see and experience all those years ago. It's terrific with some truly great themes, which delves into; human connections, friendship, the power of empathy, the fear of the unknown, and the acceptance of differences. Friendship is the most important one because of how the story related to Steven Spielberg and possibly many other children who have experienced any form of trauma, small like big. This is a family film, a film for all ages. The jokes land, it's honestly a pretty funny movie and really entertaining. Steven Spielberg have made a film with such strong characters, thanks to the writing, and he choose right actors for the roles. Earlier I wrote how it was a family film, I'm quite sure it would be scary at times for children because of how it's directed, and that's what makes it special and not like any other film out there. Spielberg is a director with such range, having made films in several genres. With Jaws, he showed how fantastic he is in creating tension and suspension, he uses those to make this family film suspenseful. I liked how he waited to show the ""antagonists"" as it created a mystery with plenty of suspension and tension behind them, it was done all through camera angles and such. With all its themes which I would call perfectly executed, a story so human and full of emotion, E. T. the Extra-Terrestrial is a magnificent piece of work from the auteur. Steven Spielberg created another blockbuster but what's most important is how he created E. T, a character which became a phenomenon, a movie that took the world by a storm. ""E. T. phone home."", a quote which became part of pop culture.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

scarred for life,"The first thing you need to know is that my impression of this film is forever colored by my first exposure to it.  When ET was released, I was 4 years old.  It is the first movie I can remember seeing in the theater, and it scarred me for life.  Really, this is a widespread phenomenon.  If you were not born between the years 1977 and 1980, you may not understand what I'm talking about, but I'm telling you it's true.  Ask anyone in that age bracket--if they saw ET in the theater, I guarantee they had the same experience.Imagine yourself as a four-year-old, in a dark room, filled with people you don't know, watching the story of ET.  You are a bit apprehensive about this strange-looking creature, but as Henry Thomas and Drew Barrymore grow to love him, so do you.  You want one of your own...he's like a pet or maybe a stuffed animal come to life.  What fun!  Until, that is, the horrible people in the white jumpsuits take over the movie.   All of a sudden, all these grown-ups are out to get ET.  The screen is taken over by mean-looking people and, even worse, all those scary tubes and quarantine equipment.  At this point, you--the four-year-old--are terrified.  You don't understand why all those mean people want to hurt ET.  Your parents take you out of the theater, into the shock of daylight, and more than likely vow not to take you to a movie for a long, long time.Now, I can understand that ET is a highly regarded film, and I can appreciate why many people love it.  But I defy you to find someone born in 1977-1980 who loves it.  We were all scarred for life.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Another Spielberg Masterpiece; A Gift to Children and Adults,"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is directed by Steven Spielberg and is the story of an alien accidentally abandoned on Earth by his parents. He soon meets a little boy named Elliott, played by Henry Thomas, and the two strike up a quick friendship. Elliott's older brother Michael (Robert Macnaughton) and younger sister Gertie (Drew Barrymore) also meet the little alien, and befriend him. However, they soon realize they aren't the only ones who know about E.T., which pits the three children against none other than the U.S. government.This film is know as a masterpiece, and it's not quite hard to see why. Spielberg has made many cherished films throughout his lifetime, including Jaws (1975), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), and Saving Private Ryan (1998). However, E.T. is his only film directed mostly towards children, and boy he nailed it. This movie isn't just about a little dumb alien that gets himself into small altercations, this movie's about childhood, and what it means to have a true friend, whether he be a person or an alien. E.T. is also about family hardships, including tough relationships with siblings, or even divorce. E.T. can be loved by kids, or by adults, and that's not a quality easily achievable.This film has many things to offer, and quite possibly the best one is, as mentioned above, the underlying themes. All of the kids in this film are dealing with their parents splitting up, and their dad lying about where he currently is to all of them. This can be related to be lots of people, mostly because of the diversity of ages between the children. Michael is about 16, Elliott's around 10, and Gertie's roughly 4. This variety of ages allows almost anybody to relate to the parental divorce factor given throughout E.T.Another theme this movie offers is the tough connection between siblings, most abundant between Michael and Elliott. Towards the beginning of the film, Michael and all of his friends poke fun at Elliott claiming he saw an alien in the back yard. Although they see it as a harmless joke, Elliott takes offense to it, even calling one of Michael's friends a slightly crude, yet hilarious, name. Later, after Michael has been confirmed the existence of the alien, his friends make fun of Elliott at a bus stop, asking which planet the ""goblin"" came from. Michael quickly jumps to his brother's defense, without even thinking of what his friends may think of him afterwards. This a great example of brotherhood, that can be related to by young children, teenagers, or adults.Now, for the more technicality of the film. The direction is amazing. As always, Spielberg does a perfect job directing the movie, and getting every shot just right. The acting is great as well. Henry Thomas as Elliott is one of the best child performances of all time, thanks to the emotion he shows through caring for E.T. Drew Barrymore also does really well, especially considering she's four years old in this film. Not that she has the biggest part, or the most lines, but the scenes she is in are lightened up by her line delivery and all around adorableness. Robert Macnaughton as Michael and Dee Wallace as their mother, Mary, also deliver pretty good performances.Now, if someone went back and watched 1977's Star Wars, or even it's sequel, The Empire Strikes Back (1980), they wouldn't be able to spot a single shot that looks bad, as far as CGI goes. However, going back and watching this movie, a few of the shots, especially of the spaceship, look pretty fake. Keep in mind, this film came out in 1982, five years after Star Wars (1977) and two years after The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and some of the CGI just doesn't hold up. There are more than a few times that E.T. had some obvious green screen going on, either with the spaceship of the flying bikes (we all remember that part, right). However, this is the only negative this film has or will ever have.Overall, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is a straight up masterpiece. Many films have tried to copy this movie, including Earth to Echo (2014), and even some elements of the film Super 8 (2011), but none have ever succeeded. Thanks to it's amazing acting, fantastic themes, and great direction, E.T. gets an A, or a 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Brilliant,"E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982)**** (out of 4)A lonely young boy (Henry Thomas) finds a stranded alien who he calls E.T. and must help him get back home. It's rather strange how sentimental this movie is because the farthest back in life that I can remember is my mother taking me to see this on opening night. If the release date for this on IMDb is correct then I 25 months and 2 days old. It's strange but I still remember just about every feeling that I was feeling while watching the movie then and I still fondly remember the reaction that the other kids were having while watching the movie. All these years later I still have the same affection towards the film and it still makes me lose it like a little girl just like it did when I first watched it. I certainly don't think this is a movie for young kids due to various subject matters including death but I once read an interview with Spielberg who said it was a film for anyone who believes. This is certainly one of the most magical movies out there due to its sense of wonder and its meaning of friendship. In a lot of science-fiction movies we really don't get to know or feel for the characters but that's not the case here because the screenplay is so smart that we learn all sorts of facts about not only the humans but E.T. himself. Thomas gives the greatest performance here that I've ever seen from a child but I'd probably go even further by calling it one of the greatest ever put to film. The range of emotions he has to display is rather amazing considering his age. Dee Wallace, Drew Barrymore, Robert MacNaughton and Peter Coyote are all very good as well. The greatest performance in the film has to go to the special effects that created E.T. and made him one of the most memorable characters in the history of film. The 2002 ""CGI enhanced"" version is pure garbage but the original creature is one of the greatest to ever come to the screen and it's just amazing at how well he holds up and how human they were able to make him. With his funny talk, silly walk and human eyes, he really is one of the most loved characters in film history. I also find John Williams score to be the best work of his career and it certainly gives an extra charge to all of the scenes, especially at the end.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I'm not a fan of E.T.,"After more than 15 years I saw ""E. T."" again. I was since my youth not a big fan of the film ehr. As a small child, I think I have seen more often and also prefer. Something about the film has me later but always disturbed and caused discomfort in me. Now times with today's eyes ""new"" considered. Well, the film just can't inspire me (anymore).It already starts with the fact that the children are unsympathetic to me. Furthermore, the film celebrates that food waste is apparently perfectly okay. Elliot goes to the house with the pizza box, hears a noise outside in the garden shed, and goes into the garden WITH the pizza box in his arms. Why doesn't he just set it down on the table where he was standing when he heard the noise? But he then puts it down on the grass in the cold and wet garden. Well, okay, it's just stupid. But it gets really stupid when he then gets startled and accidentally steps on the pizza box. Okay, even that is not the crowning glory. The crowning glory is when the family is out in the backyard, opens the pizza box and sees that a little bit of pizza is slightly crushed and some toppings and cheese are stuck to the lid. Yeah, how gross! Can't eat it anymore, of course, so left outside in the garden. OLD! With scenes like this, I'm not surprised that people have been totally wasteful with food since the 80s and some are extremely sensitive. Iiiihhh, bah, someone stepped on the PizzaSCHACHTEL, the pizza is therefore no longer edible. What does a Mr. Spielberg actually want to tell the viewers of the film with this scene?Then again this typical behavior of the youth to simply throw down bicycles. I'm not surprised that so many young people and children in this country do this and did it in my childhood/youth. I have always hated that. How can you handle your own bike like that? Again, I guess this movie has also had a little influence on the negative behavior of kids udn teenagers.Okay, it's just one stupid scene. But unfortunately the film is also strange in other respects. Adults (except the mother) are never really shown in the first 70 minutes of the film, always only the legs or the back, but never the faces. Something like that annoys me!The story is okay.The music is the best part of the movie.I give benevolent7/10 points - no rewatch value.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Good movie, but not as great as I remember it","Like most people, I first saw this film as a little child. I think I had just learned to read so I could follow the subtitles. And it was great. Childhood hijinks, bizarre aliens, chases, toys, skipping school to hang with your new friend, getting drunk (yeah...), making excuses to your mom, distrusting adults, high adventures and grand plans. What's not to like?But now, as I rewatched it for the first time as an adult, it just didn't grab me as well as it did. It's still an interesting movie and certainly iconic on every level, from visuals to the characters to the story. But somehow it seemed hollow to me, like the story wasn't as deep as it needed to be to really pull us in. And that's a problem. It's a simple kid's story trying to function as a young adults movie. Not that kid's stories cannot be deep, of course they can, but they're usually rather simple in structure. Like E.T., which goes basically like this: boy finds something strange in the forest, he brings it home or it follows him home, he tries to hide it from his parents, they become the bestest of best friends, but eventually the boy has to release his new pet back into the wild because the pet is not meant to live with humans. Simple, allegoric, message-teaching. The problems start when you try to introduce the big bad government as the antagonists or you try to include scenes with sexual or alcoholic references. Because they stand out and they seem superfluous.It still works, don't get me wrong. E.T. is a cultural classic for a reason. Sure, there's a certain amount of love it or hate it to the alien's creepy muteness, sure the children are rather clichéd, sure the mom's willful ignorance requires a lot of willing suspension of disbelief. But when it works, when the bike suddenly lifts from the air, when the children are completely enthralled by their new friends, when the alien craft lands on Earth. Then it's magic.I theorize that E.T. works really well for you if you're a child yourself or if you want to be a child again. It's a great movie about childhood. Unfortunately as a twenty-something I don't really fall into either of those categories, so it didn't quite work for me right now.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"A movie kids, and *only* kids, will enjoy","I had higher expectations for this one than I thought. When I actually sat down to watch it, I was expecting(from all the popularity it has achieved and such) a good, quality fantasy sci-fi comedy adventure. What I got was basically every other kids movie, just with better effects. I mean, Spielberg is a good filmmaker, so why would he spend time and money making such a typical, formulaic kids movie? I mean, I realize that the film does establish a good connection between E.T. and Elliot, but does that process necessarily require to alienate every single adult character in the film too? Every single adult character is stupid, and they are mostly depicted as jerks. I liked the way Spielberg made it kiddy-like by not showing one single adult persons face before the final 45 minutes or so(apart from Elliot's mother), but did he have to make every single adult in the movie out to be so mindless and stupid? The kids aren't much better; Elliot is whiny, easily startled and plain annoying. Gertie is girly and annoying, and every teen character comes off as a jerk, just like the adults. Spielberg has, purposefully or not, created a movie that only kids will be able to identify with and like. Anyone over the age of 10 will be annoyed, if not offended, by the way anyone over that age is depicted. The films humor is exactly the same as in any other kids movie, only less disgusting that most other. The only worthwhile reason to see this movie if you're not a kid is the special effects. E.T. himself is even annoying for most of the time. Had this film had something worthwhile to tell us, apart from how, somehow, a kid can relate more to an alien creature from another planet than he can with any human, it might have been good. Hell, it would've been good if it just wasn't so awfully kiddy-like and centered on making it entertaining for kids. If you want to see a good children's movie that anyone past puberty can also enjoy, I recommend the first The Neverending Story. That is a lot better. The only thing that is worth watching in this film is special effects, and very few of the gags and jokes that are funny to anyone above the age of 7. I recommend this only to kids and huge fans of Spielberg. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

He pulled the wool over everybodys' eyes by using strategic emotional button-pushing and his typical order to John Williams for an overbearing tug-at-the-heart-strings soundtrack.With the exception of Jaws and Raiders of the Lost Ark, I think Spielberg is an overrated kiddie-themed story teller, until he learned to make truly great movies like Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Such a magical movie,"Recently watched this one for the first time since I was a kid and now I am 23 years old. I vaguely remember seeing it before, but this time I was really blown away. The nostalgia was like nothing I have experienced watching a movie before. I woke up the next morning wanting to immerse myself into this universe. There's just something so completely innocent about it. Makes me want to be a kid again. There's something about getting older that makes you appreciate being a kid, and this is really one of those movies that makes you feel that way.The movie isn't really extraordinary on a technical level. Seeing it as an adult you pick up on some of the stuff that just doesn't really appeal to you anymore. That's another great thing about the movie though, it appeals to both kids and adults. It reminds me of the Lion King a bit in that sense. You are more prone to pick up on some of the logical flaws in the movie as an adult, whereas when you were a kid it may have been something you enjoyed. Usually I am pretty strict when it comes to how I review movies. If this one didn't reach to me on a personal level so much, I'd probably give it an 8/10 or so. But it's great this movie is able to bring what could have been a mediocre one into such an amazing classic.There are a few reasons it really works. First, the acting by the young cast is excellent, especially from Henry Thomas and Drew Barrymore, who seems to have always been a natural at acting. It's really great how the movie is from their vantage point throughout the entire movie. Secondly, the music is absolutely brilliant and chilling.

"An above average film, but a bit over-rated","I think E.T. is a real good family movie especially for all the children to watch but after seeing it again I realize that it is a little dated now, and not quite as good as I remembered it being when I first watched it when I was young and saw it in theater and when it fist came out on videotape. I think kids like it obviously more than that adults would. The story has holes and is pretty simple but for kids it's real good. I did not like any of the restored and changed things in all the updates of the movie, especially changing the guns into the flashlights. What is the point of that? I was a kid when I saw it but the flashlights did no scare me at all. Kids aren't as fragile as I think these directors are thinking nowadays. Anyway I give E.T. a six out of ten rating because it is a good movie that is worth seeing with some unforgettable scene but only if you have kids watching and there are many better films out there that are not so well liked.

"Weighty and more than substantial piece flicking through a great deal of emotional substance, on top of what is a magical, creative science fiction drama.","Aliens. Beings from outer space – touching down on planet Earth with the intent to do whatever they please. Such films with the above premise, indeed any premise revolving around human-beings coming into contact with extra terrestrials, we often find are always so much more interesting when they come to socially, rather than aggressively, intermingle with that of the Earth's inhabitants. We enjoy films such as Robert Wise's original The Day the Earth Stood Still and the recent Peter Jackson funded District 9 a whole lot more than we do, say, Transformers or Independence Day – films about creatures with the ability to journey as far as they can but with nary a lot else to do than reduce Earth to rubble. Somewhere in the midst of all of this lies Spielberg's 1982 film E.T., a film, like the best of the above examples, about an alien creature not coming to Earth with the necessity to destroy it, but to carry a message or explore or, in the titular character's case, desire to make contact.When E.T. begins, it launches itself quietly; ominously and in the mould of Ridley Scott's Alien from a few years previously, as this suspicious glance across the starry night sky to ghostly musical tones dominate proceedings. The set up for an uncanny, fearful representation as we uneasily look up beyond the stars at the unknown appears prominent; the camera tilting downwards revealing a dense Californian forest fore-bearing the literal physical movement that the space ship which eventually arrives will undertake. Out of the ship arrives a flurry of small creatures, shot anonymously as we struggle to focus on them for all the fern and low light. One little fella gets overly curious, gazing long fully over a nearby town from this position on a hill-top having wondered away from his ilk. He appears humble; his kind clearly have the technology to kick something undesirable off with our species but instead gather samples of plants and such, his pensive body language has him appear fearful of us rather than the other way around.Chaos arrives with the coming of some humans; shot equally anonymously in their charging and rushing through the forest, they come via a bevvy of 4x4 trucks whose arrival counterbalances that of the ship's smooth descent. They explore, finding our little creature and give chase; their flashlights juxtaposing this being's increasingly glowing red chest. It stumbles and fumbles to get back to its friends, whom are readying to leave, and thus, we find ourselves going against our own kind and rooting on this little being to make it back. But it is too late: the ship departs without him and the cluster of men eventually go on to loose their target. Within that aforementioned town dwells young Elliot (Thomas), a boy living with his bigger brother Michael (MacNaughton) and younger sister Gertie (Barrymore) alongside their divorced mother in a neat, suburban neighbourhood.When we first observe Elliot, it is on a recreational summer evening with Michael and a few of his friends while they play a board game; Elliot attempts to join in, but is marginalised and kept at bay – a later meeting out in the garden with our space man, whose trundled down from the hills, the catalyst leading Elliot to explore what is, to him, the unknown, just as everything around him is to this space creature. The film branches out into a wondrous, deeply affecting drama about the lead being able to find a proverbial level with a organism after having been marginalised during the board game and by those at school. Tied into proceedings is the thriller aspect consisting of the government agents doing their utmost to find E.T., the strand doing well to maintain tension as these rather defenceless children slowly come to bond with what is the agent's prize whilst the net, unbeknownst to them, closes in.The notion of E.T.'s rejection of the more aggressively inclined, less humble-a being that he is, is a sentiment beautifully, cheekily even, captured in Elliot's bedroom when the boy raises a Boba Fett plastic toy in front of that of E.T. The toy, of the Lucas-film variety, is identified by Elliot as a creature more preoccupied with blasting away at other beings; something epitomising a more shallow-a depiction of aliens that are additionally identified within the comment as being much more rife in popular culture. In having Elliot hold the toy up in the manner he does, E.T. standing in the background but still dominating the frame, Spielberg literally dwarfs this toy in comparison to his bigger; more predominant idea of what should constitute as a filmic alien: Spielberg's is a lot more interesting. The film is a cracking, rollicking adventure; a notion in spite of the fact it rarely gets outside of a quaint suburban home based in one of those bright, perky American estates. It is a film full of a great deal of emotional involvement and heady attachment to the characters, human or otherwise, therein; a film doing its utmost to cover that of a group of siblings cut apart by the divorce of their parents and their consequent realignment through this wondrous catalyst that is the falling to Earth of a space-creature. Consumatley made, imperiously acted by the child-performers and wonderfully tactile in its tonal shifts from coming of age to chase thriller to comedy, E.T. hits most, if not all, of the notes it goes for.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Simply wonderful,"Right after I finished watching, I was quite torn as to how I felt about this film. However, after some reflection, I realized that E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial really is quite a wonderful film.The first thing I noticed, were the similarities to Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The first thing was the absolutely wonderful practical effects which make both movies look great even 40 years later. The second thing I noticed was how much the stories resembled each other. In both, there is a slightly troubled family, one person who is looking for some deeper meaning and the people and connections they find along the way.
While I think that Close Encounters managed to create a more compelling and interesting story, I do believe that E.T. more than makes up for it with its wonderful characters and heartfelt ending.Watching E.T. for the first time 38 years after its release really makes me wonder why movies like this aren't made anymore. Wouldn't it be wonderful to see something like this on the big screen once again and feel that sense of wonder and mystery? Luckily, E.T. will look great even 40 years from now, meaning that there will always be at least one movie like it.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Favorite movie when I was a kid,"This movie brings back some great memories of my childhood. I used to watch this movie two or three times a week I liked it so much. The idea was so new and original,directed perfectly and for a 80s film the acting was actually quite good. It is a heartwarming talke that will make you laugh and then all the sudden tear up.This movie is about a young quiet boy named Elliot. One day Elliot hears a noise in his shed so he decides to go have a look.What he finds is what he least expects...something not from this world.

E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is a classic for all time!,"I've only seen this most successful movie in its entirety three times in my life: The first time was in its year of release in 1982, when I was fourteen, with my year-younger brother in tow, as it was playing in the now-defunct Cinema 8 in what was then Bon Marche Mall in Baton Rouge, LA. The second time was when it was first released on VHS tape in 1988. The third time was last month when I was in The Philippines and at a relative's house looking at HBO Asia and there it was so I stayed to watch it. For that last showing I first noticed that the phrase with the initials of ""P. B"" were deleted, that the b-word for female dog was silenced when the teen boy said it, and that I now got the ""Uranus"" crack from another teen boy. Now I know that this is a pretty manipulative movie concerning emotions but in this case, I think that's a good thing as it earns it with the laughs and sadness concerning the title character, Elliott and his siblings Michael and Gertie, their mother, and even that guy who tells Elliott about his previous encounter with E. T. Director Steven Spielberg pushes all the right buttons, that's for sure! I also liked many of the Star Wars references. That might be a sign of how close he and George Lucas were and I''m guessing, still are. I especially liked the Halloween scene with E. T. encountering a little kid dressed as Yoda! Oh, and once again, John Williams provides an excellent score for one of Spielberg's movies. So, yes, E. T. the Extra-Terrestrial is still a masterpiece worthy of its phenomenal success.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Would it be a classic if it would have been released today?,"Steven Spielberg and John Williams are the big names in this film. Both at an unparalleled moment in their respective careers, which they often managed to put together. It's not for nothing that Spielberg is considered one of the greatest and best directors in history, and here his work is excellent, both in the management of the shots, in the supervision and requirements for the children's cast, and much more. Williams for his part, leaving a clear mark of his work, with an impeccable soundtrack that contributes greatly to the adventure displayed on screen.As for the story, everything focuses on mystery and childish emotion, since the plot is seen from the eyes of children, who look up as adults do their thing around an unprecedented scientific discovery. There are many inconsistencies, inexplicable facts, events that do not fit or hold together, but none of that matters, because here visceral sensations are more valuable than reason itself.E. T.

a Real classic 80's movie.,E. T. is really a classic movie made in 1982. The 80's time. It was directed and made by Steven Spielberg himself. The boy named Elliott meets E. T. the alien comes to Earth. Elliott's brother sister and his mother live a house in California too. The film really masters the coolness of E. T. and the boy Elliott and had all the 80's vibes to it. His Brother and Little Sister even got to know E. T. too and his mom but until the government breaks in their house and try to take E. T. away which was crazy. Til all of Elliott's friends save E. T. on their bikes and He goes back Home in his spaceship in the end. E. T. Is a really good 80s movie!,10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
THE BEST FILM I'VE EVER SEEN,"I'm not saying anything that hasn't been said here, but I had to share my experience with this film. E. T is basically, a film about divorce and the struggle kids have experiencing it. My parents got a separation a year earlier, and I didn't take it very well. I became an angry, sad, uncontrollable, kid. Contrary to belief, E. T did not have much of a marketing campaign before the film. That marketing surge came later. So I had no idea about this film that was going to save my life .I'll never forget the day, my grandparents took my sister and I too see E. T. I didn't know anything about it, really. It BLEW me away! I was 10 years old in 82' and it was a movie experience I've never felt before. I felt like I was exactly in Elliot's shoes. Little did I know, what an impact this film would have on me. From the beautiful scenery to the suburban neighborhood and the iconic flight over the moon.Such an incredible range of emotions from scared, happy, funny, sad, and finally.. relieved with a sense of everything is going to be ok.It's hard to explain how E. Tbecame the focus of the rest of my summer;) I saw E. T over 15 times from June throughout the rest of the year , back when movies played the whole year. Especially, E. T. Damn. That was an amazing Christmas. I got so much E. T related gifts, it was crazy. From the long underwear and red hoodie, to every action figure and Reese Pieces, and of course;) the John William' incredible soundtrack. Played the hell out it lol. I don't think I'll ever forget the feelings I had from E. T.My favorite seen in the film was Dee Wallace reading Peter Pan to Gertie. I don't why but I found that particular scene, magical. Oh, I couldn't believe ""Gandhi"" beat E. T for best picture that year at the Academy Awards. I was devastated lol. I wish I could go back in time and feel the incredible emotions I experienced when I fits saw E. T., but I can't seem to find a ""Flux Capacitor"". Maybe one day;) E. T.. timeless classic.

Unrealistic,"I see that many people here have praised ET to the heavens, and maybe rightly so, but I'm particularly cynical when we have films that contain two of the most dangerous groups in society: children and aliens.Now is it just me, or are kids really nasty little things? If so, then why is it that it's always kids that discover kindly aliens, monsters, robots or beings of pure energy, that adults always want to destroy or at least slice open? Just once I'd like to see an adult find a nice, kind caring monster and then have to protect it from a hoard of marauding children. Don't believe that would happen? Try dressing up as a Teletubbie and spend a day shopping at a mall, then you'll see.Also, I'm not sure what kind of advanced alien species ET was from, but whoever was flying that ship was a bit of a moron and in serious trouble. Let's face it, in today's litigious society, where you can get sued for serving hot coffee, imagine the kind of lawsuit ET would have had against the tour firm he was travelling with! Plus, why did he have to call home, wouldn't his wife, girlfriend (or boyfriend) have raised the alarm when he didn't come back? But that kind of trouble pales in comparison to the amount of explaining he'd have to do:`I'm sorry honey, you see I got lost and the guys left without me and I couldn't find a phone anywhere.

The Most Amazing Film Ever,"I first saw E.T when I was about 8. To me it was just like any other film, I didn't cry or laugh and to be honest it scared me a bit. Then when I was 16, I sat down to watch it and I have not been the same since. It was INCREDIBLE. I started out laughing, then the music gave me a lump in my throat and before I knew it I was sobbing uncontrollably and I did for most of the day. E.T can move even the most intense and cynical of people and make them remember how truly beautiful life can be. The Cast is fabulous, with admirable performances by Mcnaughton and Barrymore, but Henry Thomas gives a performance like no other in this, film acting way beyond his years. The films central relationship is the kind of friendship that is envied by us all. John Williams's music is beautifully adapted to story telling and it moves you to such an extent you can't think about anything else all day. So if you haven't seen this film, you haven't lived.

Charming fantasy with great John Williams score...,"When a little lost alien meets a 10-year-old boy (Henry Thomas), the plot of E.T. takes off and soars to a rollicking conclusion with a tearful farewell scene that is given an almost operatic quality by John Williams' emotional music. Williams wrings every drop of emotion out of his skillful score--one of his very best.Along the way we're treated to a series of misadventures involving the alien--one of the funniest is the Halloween sequence--another memorable one is the chase when the bicycles lift off the ground and soar into the sky against a full moon. Henry Thomas, as the little boy who feels a close kinship with the ugly alien, gives what is undoubtedly one of the finest performances ever by a child star.Not long after the release of the film, I recall seeing him perform in front of a group of celebrities at some shindig where the spotlight was on him as he went through the paces of a dramatic scene. The cameras caught the people watching--one of them was actress Olivia de Havilland who was watching with rapt admiration, clearly seeing that his was a major talent.There is manipulation, to be sure. The emotional ending is guaranteed to leave you wiping your eyes as Elliot (Henry Thomas) learns that friendship knows no earthly bounds.Only drawback is the film's length--but nevertheless, a fine family film for the young, marred only by the use of some vulgar language.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I Want To Go Home With E.T.,"I saw E.T. (1982) when I was 10 years old - and for a long while after watching the film I wanted a space alien for a best friend just like Elliot had. I thought it would be so cool to have a secret friend not from planet earth. Just think about what I can teach and show him about earth, likewise, what the creature could show and teach me! I remember at the end of the movie I wanted leave planet earth with E.T. - and is most likely the reason why as an adult I would still love to ""fly away"" with space aliens (E.T. along with the aliens from ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"").As an adult I think E.T. is one of the greatest family films ever made.

An Alien Seen Through Children: Most-Moving SF Film Ever Created in the Wake of the SF Craze,"With the release of George Lucas' original ""Star Wars"" film in 1977 (later re-titled ""Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope"") and Steven Spielberg's ""Close Encounter of the Third Kind"", the genre of Science Fiction film was reborn into the mainstream. Previously it had been primarily marketed to adolescent boys as either b-films or cliff-hanger series in matinees from circa 1935 to 1970. For about 5 to 6 years from circa 1977 to 1983, the entertainment industry cranked out tons of Science Fiction based films and television shows, most of which were of marginal quality, such as ""Buck Rogers"", ""Battlestar Gallactica"" and ""The Black Hole"" which were simply trying to mirror the success of Star Wars. A few were superb standout's, such as ""Alien"", ""Blade Runner"" and ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"". At the end of this short period when the studios were saturating movie theaters with just about anything with space ships, Steven Spielberg and company produced and released ""E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial"".Unlike most of Hollywood's Science Fiction offerings from the release of Star Wars in 1977 to its third installment ""Return of the Jedi"" in 1983, ""E.T."" didn't rely on space ships and galactic battles. Yes, there's a space ship in a couple of scenes, and even a few technological miracles, but that's not the main point. ""E.T."" is primarily about how children see the world as opposed to adults. In a strange way, ""E.T."" probably has more in common with ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" than ""Star Wars"", the former being injustice as seen by children in a similar way. The themes of ""E.T."" are so moving because we see the alien through children who don't quite fear things the way adults do. Not to say that children don't have fears, but sometimes wonder can overcome fear, which is I think at the heart of ""E.T."" The alien is also very childlike, often exploring and getting into things he shouldn't be. ""E.T."" is thematically opposite from ""Alien"" released just two years earlier in which an horrific alien creatures infiltrates and attacks a galactic space ship. So although ""Alien"", ""Close and Encounters of the Third Kind"" and the original ""Star Wars"" films are in more or less the same Science Fiction genre, the similarities end there for the most part.The story-line is deceptively simple but allows for the development of not only the characters but their relationships. A spaceship has landed on Earth and some beings from another solar system have been exploring our planet in a wooded area not far from a suburban community. For them, our planet is an alien world. One of the explorers was so curious about our planet he wandered far away from the space ship. Government men became aware that something was going on, and when they made their presence known, the ship was forced to leave, causing their companion to be stranded on Earth. Throughout the film are the government men who are investigating what's going on, and they become somewhat adversarial to the alien being and the children. Intensely curious about us and our planet, he wanders into the suburban community and hides in a shed of a house where a single mom and her three children reside. He is discovered by the younger son Elliott (Henry Thomas), the middle child of the three.One of the most effective sequences is how Elliott and the alien meet and find common ground. Elliott leaves trails of Reese's Pieces which are picked up by the alien. But instead of eating them, the alien places a handful of them on Elliott's lap as a gesture of friendship and goodwill. Some kind of message has passed between them, not of spoken language but based on friendship gestures. Interestingly, the alien is not afraid; the alien has to persuade Elliott that he has nothing to fear. As events unfold, Elliott is vaguely aware that the adults in his life won't understand the alien, and he keeps him a secret. Eventually he introduces him to his siblings, who he has nicknamed ""E.T."". In one of the most interesting scenes, E.T. communicates that he needs to contact his race and let them know they can come for him. ""E.T. phone home"" becomes the line of the film. And he helps them build a kind of intergalactic telephone made of electronic toys. However, the adults finally catch up with Elliott and intervene between him and the alien. In one of the most disturbing scenes of the film, the government men infiltrate Elliott's house, and they are dressed in space suits, as if they are the invaders.One of the most striking aspects of ""E.T."" is that nearly every scene is shot from the height of a child, just above the waste of an adult. E.T. is short and he relates to the children but seems much less interested in the adults, as if he has a sense the adults will be too quick to judge who and what he is before he can give them a chance. When the mother finally is shown E.T. she freaks out. This is the essence of E.T. about the wonder of childhood and how children, even if they may be inexperienced, are sometimes more open to new possibilities than adults. The children exhibit love towards E.T. whereas we get the sense the adults are operating more out of fear.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Kids = Gooood!; Adults = Baaaad!,"Sounds like bleating, doesn't it? Spot on! That is indeed intention to sound like the sheep in Orwell's ""Animal Farm"".Frankly: All kids MUST love this. Simply because it's according to their thinking: emotional, straightforward, open-hearted, without monetary ambitions etc. The adults are, almost in a stereotypical way, the bad guys here: except for Elliot's mother, who must be regarded as a neutral person, i. e. neither 'good' nor 'bad'. Notable adult roles are the government people trying to wiretap the kids' dialogues; the doctors who don't listen to each other but each of them talking their sort of ""I was the better medicine student"" gobbledigook at the very same time. The scene with E. T. in the box and the doctors around him babbling hectically reminded me a little bit of the no less stereotypical ""Planet Of The Apes"" with a similar annotation of ""doing experiments with the innocent and defenseless"". That's exactly where Spielberg creates bias on kids so that they'll exclaim something like ""A typical doctor's behavior!"", since each one claims his diagnosis to be the best, and makes it happen: that is, his own thought of 'best possible medication' of the mysterious creature from outer space...And furthermore, the (child?) viewer will summarize: merely kid's true love and friendship can even resurrect an alien from its 'death.'

"Hard to be objective, but this is a truly special film for me","First off, I am so disappointed my children found this film boring when I took them to the theater for a 35th anniversary screening. They didn't hate it, but they did not get the sense of wonder and magic that I got when I watched this film as a child. Granted I was a few years older than them, but I'm still disappointed. Anyhow, ""E.T. the Extra- Terrestrial"" drips in 1980s nostalgia, with Mike and his friends playing Dungeons & Dragons while ordering pizza from a corded telephone, Space Invaders t-shirts, references to someone getting the high score on Asteroids, BMX bikes prominently featured, and so on an so forth. That alone made this film fun to rewatch, but beyond Gen-X nostalgia, Steven Spielberg does what he did best during this period of his career, he brought a sense of magic to the world. Spielberg at this time also populated his world with characters who seem very real and identifiable. I was the exact same age as Henry Thomas when this film first came out (I suppose I'm same age now as well), so that likely also added to me feeling a strong connection to the characters in the story when I originally saw the film. Thomas is great and very genuine in his performance, but this was Drew Barrymore's first film and she really does steal every scene she's in. It's hard to say a six-year-old has star quality, or if it's the script, or if it was Spielberg, but she has some of the film's best moments; dressing up E.T., calling him a deformed kid, telling her brothers, ""Give me a break!"" or her the film's heartfelt finale with E.T. telling Gertie to ""Beeeeeee... gooood."" The overall story is of a boy hiding a lost alien in his closet and helping him get home is charming, but I believe it's really all of these small moments that made this film great. It's as if ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"" is entirely filled with precious Spielbergian scenes like the one from Jaws where Chief Brody and his son mimic each other at the dinner table. I couldn't get over how charming and innocent moments of the film were, particularly when Elliott first coaxes E.T. out of his closet and tells him all of his toys. Those little touches all add up to making the audience more connected with these characters, even if they don't necessarily forward the plot. Those are the scenes that stick in your mind, although the flying bicycles are certainly going to stick in your mind and are a big plot moment. A few things I don't think I picked up on when I originally watched this film was some foreshadowing of E.T. and Elliott's connection. Early on in the film when Elliott is getting food from the fridge, E.T. is startled by something in Elliott's room and shrieks, causing Elliott to also shriek and spill a carton of milk. Upon first viewing, you'd think it was E.T.'s shriek that startled Elliott, but it's the start of their psychic and physical bond between the two. The other part of the film that escaped me as a child was Elliott's mom, Dee Wallace and a great performance that's very nearly very easy to miss, struggling with being a newly single mom and a still coming to terms with a recent divorce. Her struggles as a parent are something I now identify with as an adult and allowed for a new emotional connection to the film and characters. It was also fun when rewatching the film to see how many tips-of-the-hat that were done in ""Stranger Things"" to this film. It's no secret that ""Stranger Things"" cribbed heavily form Spielberg, but I was struck by how spot on ""Stranger Things"" was when I actually went back to watch a Spielberg film from that era. Overall, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is a film classic and if Elliot saying, ""You could be happy here, I could take care of you. I wouldn't let anybody hurt you. We could grow up together, E.T."" doesn't get to you, you have a heart of stone.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Idiotic and annoying,"This movie relies on touchy-feelie moments from little children and a good-hearted alien to make up for lack of a smart, involving plot. It's disgusting. The alien does lots of idiotic things, the kids do lots of idiotic things, but because everyone is cute, we're supposed to love the movie. Why did a band of idiots have to find this idiotic alien? Why not smart kids finding a smart alien?

Beautiful Memory,"This movie was so beautiful. It was innocent, it was charming, and it was like the only movie then or since that has had an Alien character that ACTED instead of just killed humans or was like an insect. There was a movie with Louis Gosset Jr. and Dennis Quaid that was also good.But this movie brought us Drew Barrymore! She has been such an amazing actress over the years, getting more beautiful all the time. She was so cute in this movie and I totally had a crush on Harry when he played her brother.I hear that Spielberg has changed this movie and taken out guns and the word ""terrorist"" which I guess is OK. But why did he then make dark and scary movies about terrorists? That doesn't make sense to me. It's so sad that War of the Worlds is how he feels about aliens now. I liked it better when it was E.T.:c)",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Yeah, it's a masterpiece, but... yeah, it is.","Alright, alright, you got me, ET is a great movie - mostly for the little moments that Steven Spielberg captures in the first half (or first two-thirds) before it becomes the big emotional spectacle that the director deals with as something he has to do as a Capra fan. What I loved was seeing the early, 'hmm' part of Elliot/ET's friendship, where its a bit like a boy and his dog, only the ET is much more curious than a dog (and he can TALK!) I can't deny this is a director at the peak of his powers. That said, my one real 'but' is in that sense it's like his North by Northwest; Hitchcock, too, was at the peak of his powers with that, making as much a symphony as a movie. It's just not 'personal' favorite of mine (I still get more from Close Encounters).Nevertheless, also like NBNW, this is a very entertaining film at its core, with a lot of shameless laughs (Gertie SCREAMS! ET SCREAMS BACK!), and it has BY FAR John Williams greatest score. It helps that he scored some of the film without even really watching the film cause it didn't all match up. I could listen to this just as classical music, not even as a 'this track goes here, that goes there' with the scenes. If it's not Spielberg's greatest film, he still gets the greatest assist from his closest collaborator.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Good Movie, even though it's a Children's Movie","My brother seems to hate ET. He claims that some of the scenes were ""childish."" When Harry Potter came out he refused to read it and assumed it was bad simply because it's a children's book. A lot of teenage boys nowadays seem to believe that watching children's movies is somehow shameful. They feel as if they have to pretend they hate children's movies to prove their manliness, not only to others but also to themselves.While struggling to find a reason why ET wasn't good, my brother cited Spielberg's portrayal of adults and scientists as evil. He said it was ""simplistic."" But this is a legitimate theme. Many believe that children start off innocent and as they grow older society corrupts them. Others believe children start off silly and as they grow older they mature and become better people. This concept has been pondered over for centuries by ethicists and lawyers. Why do you think children under 10 cannot be charged for murder? The legal system claims they are not capable of forming a guilty mind. This concept is far from ""simplistic."" And anyway, to all young boys scientists and adults are scary, and this movie was told from the perspective of the little boys. So of course the adults are portrayed as evil!There is virtually no flaw with this movie apart from the slight overacting by Elliot, but all in all he is one of the best child actors I've seen on screen, much better than the kid off Last Action Hero. ET has good plot, good characterization, good soundtrack, and good visual effects. It's a movie you cannot hate unless you try hard to hate it.Unfortunately for most people watching movies is about carving out an identity. People try to define their character by the sorts of movies they watch. So if you like to think of yourself as some tough guy, you'd force yourself to watch violent action movies and then go around telling everyone how much you loved these movies so others can acknowledge your identity. These are the sorts of people who scream out ""chick flick"" at any romance movie to conform to the stereotype that men can't tolerate romance.It's sad that the objectivity of movie reviewing is now corrupted by vanity.10/10",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

An alien gets lost in earth and meets a boy who befriends him and they have adventures together.,"I think this is Spielberg's best movie. I have been watching this film for almost 24 years. I never tire of it, when E.T's family come down to earth and forget to wait for E.T who wondered off a little too far. He walks around and Eliot Aka Henry Thomas finds him in the shed while he's playing baseball. He tries to see him so people don't think he's crazy, he finds the creature loves sweets, he led the alien to his room. He gets to know the creature and shows him all his things and feeds him, they become the best of friends. He tells his big brother Aka Robert MacNaughton and little sister Aka Drew Barrymore they kept him in secret. E.T misses his family, and they find he wants to phone home, E.T couldn't use a normal phone. He had to make a connection toy to call home, he collected everything he will need and they went to the forest and set everything up. They waited and waited. E.T became very sick and so did Eliot, they were both dying and rushed to hospital. Luckily Eliot and E.T survived. The boys decide to take E.T back to his spaceship where he called his family. Everyone says goodbye as E.T goes home. There are some great scenes which Henry Thomas and E.T are saying goodbye and it expresses how much E.T means to the boy aka Henry Thomas and how much E.T loves Eliot. IT was a unique story of friendship a special unique one between two people and of course of loneliness and never to take anything fo granted because you never know when you may lose them.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Extra-ordinary,"E.T. is one of my most favorite movies. I like Steven Spielberg movies. He always have the kids as the lead characters in many movies. And also the Alien character is narrated harmless and non-violent which is very impressive to me. The Cinematography and Special Effects are simply superb. And in specific, I've to mention the inspiring Music Score of the 5 times Academy Award Winner (including E.T.) John Williams. I never forget his Theme Music to this movie and I'm still hearing the sounds.The movie overall is Great! I watched this movie's 2002 (DTS version) at Theatre for the first time and many times on TVs.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Extra-Terrestrial,"Finally got to actually watching this classic, a bit late to the party. And without the Nostalgia.Overall I enjoyed ET, it was a decently fun adventure, mostly ET's interactions with the world around him were fun to watch. The characters are well written and doesn't use too many standard tropes, like even though the brother and his friends are bullying Elliot, they still care and help him when he needs it. Same goes for the CIA/Feds not being evil. About that, the Feds seem oddly nice in this movie and not overly interested in the alien in terms of examining and what not, they mostly perform medical aid.Music is great, Williams doesn't miss, though I did find the final scene too intense, might just've been me though. The main melody is memorable and of course linked with the scene everyone thinks of when thinking about ET.Directing wise honestly I didn't think this was anything special from Spielberg, it's solid and then way the adults/feds were filmed was a nice touch and felt very much like how cartoons do it, not showing the face. Keeping the camera at waist height, like a kid. But besides some iconic shots it was alright. Editing wise there were like two odd cuts. VFX were passed just barely, the final launch scene is notably bad.Starting this movie I had an entirely different idea to how it would start, but here the aliens are shown straight away and you can see them clearly. This sets up the chase element with the feds. But the mystery element falls flat. And the scenes where Elliot discovers ET have less impact/surprise.Fun movie, but didn't strike any chords in me.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Breaks through the age barriers,"I would be very surprised if there was someone out there who hasn't seen this movie already...at least someone old enough to be reading a review. Few movies are compelling enough to appeal to young and old alike and  E.T. is one of those rare gems that was able to bring an enjoyable story that spans the generation gaps.E.T. is an incredibly touching tale of a lonely young boy and his friendship with an extra terrestrial.  Henry Thomas does an excellent job portraying young Elliot and his talent shines through in this performance.  Drew Barrymore is absolutely adorable as little Gertie and quite accurately portrays Elliot's often annoying little sister.  Robert MacNaughton plays Michael...the older brother of Elliot and Gertie and does equally a fantastic job.  The talent these three exude is incredible...leaving the viewer wholeheartedly believing they are siblings out on a quest to save E.T.Although filmed in the early 80's, E.T. has undoubtedly been able to withstand the test of time.  The effects were beautifully done given the technology at the time; and although technological capabilities have vastly improved since then, E.T. still is as beautiful now as back in 1982.This movie has all the makings of a great story:  fabulous casting, believable characters, humor, action, and the occasional tugging of the heartstrings.  E.T. is definitely one of the best movies ever and ranks 10 out of 10.  If you haven't, check this one out and fast.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"E,T. Phone Home","Steven Spielberg is one of the most famous directors in the world and E.T. The Extra Terrestrial is one of his most beloved films, which is remarkable considering he has made films like Jaws, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan and the Indiana Jones series.In a Californian town, Elliot (Henry Thomas) is a lonely 10-year-old who lives with his single mother (Dee Wallace), teenage brother Michael (Robert MacNaughton) and younger sister Gertie (Drew Barrymore). Elliot is picked on by his brother but one night he finds a strangled alien in his back garden. Quickly Elliot befriends the alien who he calls E.T. and the trio of children both teach and aid E.T. who has telekinetic and healing powers. Soon Elliot and E.T. share a psychic link, but the longer E.T. stays on Earth the more ill he becomes, effecting Elliot. Added to the mix is a mystery government agency is hunting for E.T.Spielberg knows how to manipulate emotions and he certainly does it with E.T. . You feel for both the alien and the children. The characters are well defined, Elliot is the character most children can relate as he is a normal middle child who has intelligence, missing his father and is picked on by his brother. He is decently played by a young Henry Thomas and none of the acting was terrible. I personally like how Michael was portrayed: he is a bully, gets his younger brother to act as a slave and makes fun of him, but he is also protective and when it manners will come good for his younger siblings.The animatronic used for E.T. were top of the range at the time for time and looked really effective, giving E.T. emotion and physicality. I saw the 20th Anniversary DVD version which clearly added some CGI touch ups to E.T. and has the notorious scene where two guns are swapped for walkie-talkies: but it is hardly game breaker because the film is so great. John Williams also gives us another excellent film score, including a very famous signature we all know and love.E.T. is a touching film for good reason and it is a great film for whole family.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Good film!,"Classic film you will enjoy!Having not seen it since the multiple times I watched it as a kid, you now notice all the things you missed originally. Spielberg basically set out to make the entire movie from the viewpoint of Elliott, a kid. Camera angles are from a kid's point of view, adults ignore him, older brothers are annoyed by him, it's all there, I just never noticed the first time because I was exactly Elliott's age then. I mean, we never even see his teacher's face, not once. It's like he's Charlie Brown's teacher too!Another thing I realized watching this as an adult is that the government agents are not as evil as I found them to be the first time. Peter Coyote's character (who is never even given an on screen name) doesn't want to dissect E.T., he's basically Elliott as a grown-up, fascinated and wanting to learn from this alien tourist. He and his team in space suits all seemed so ominous back in the day, but watching it now, you realize they did try to save him and weren't out to chop him up and study him.

Review - E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is a great film from a technical standpoint, John Williams' score is perfect, and the visual effects aged quite well.However, it was predictable. Being predictable wasn't a flaw in this film until it became so predictable that it was anti-climatic. Plus, Spielberg treats E.T. as a dog. This film takes a lot of inspiration from these pseudo-sad horse or dog films. Consequently, I didn't feel more for E.T. than I feel for a dog.If you want a heart-warming watch this film, but if you want a really good film watch The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951).",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An absolute classic,"Steven Spielberg is considered one of modern Hollywood's founding fathers. Possibly not by coincidence, some of his closest friends, Francis Ford Coppela, George Lucas and composer John Williams are also regarded as leading Hollywood from the brink of collapse, influencing modern filmmakers the world over.E.T. is one of cinema's most iconic characters and still today, over 25 years later, enchants audiences of all ages.E.T. is an alien from an undisclosed planet, visiting earth to gather agricultural matter for later study when his ship leaves for home without him. A stranger on a strange planet, E.T. seeks means to signal his family of his abandonment and in the process, befriends a young boy by the name of Elliot. Much humour and excitement ensues leading up to a tear jerking finale which is easily one of the most memorable of all time.The movie is adapted from a personal tale from Spielberg's own childhood. His parents going through a divorce and young Steven finding a way to cope with this, he created an imaginary friend. Years later once he had established himself as a filmmaker, he decided this was an excellent subject for a family movie and so enlisted the help of screenwriter friend Melissa Mathison. Unwilling at first to write the screenplay, Melissa eventually succumbed and made a decision which would change her life forever.One of the best decisions of Spielberg made was to enlist the help of another friend, John Williams, who had worked with him before on the equally memorable movies, Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark and Jaws. Williams brought the story together with his epic soundtrack that when listened to independently of the movie, still is as captivating. The heart of the film is really held here and as any movie goer will tell you, is unmistakable.The one scene which really resonated with the audience has to be the classic and often parodied bicycle ride in the sky, the young actors silhouetted in the sun to John William's sweeping theme is always met with a cheer from the audience and is often the first thing recalled when asked ""What is your favourite scene from E.T.?"".The bond which develops between Elliot's family and the pug-faced little alien is one the audience truly is involved with and every emotion they feel is felt by the viewer. An experience which is crucial to any movie but sadly missed in most modern family tales. There is an X factor to it, but the genius of Steven Spielberg and John Williams is possibly why the movie was such a hit and judging by it's recent re-release in 2002, this hold true for a new generation of movie goers.E.T. is a picture which could be shown in another 25 years and still hold a massive audience. It is a yardstick to which hundreds of movies since have been measured and we have yet to see any that come close. An absolute classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Wonderful movie.,"This is a SF story about aliens who comes to the earth; it is mainly about one alien and one human boy. He is left on the earth when other aliens go back to their planet.The most attracting point of the story I thought is the strong bond between E.T., the alien, and the boy, Elliot, and his brother and sister. It is funny that Elliot and E.T. act the same thing even though they are at far place. The story is very moving when three kids try to save E.T. It is also thrilling if they are going to be fine or not, Moreover, The last scene of the movie is the most touching. I bet that many viewers should have cried. In addition, this movie is filled with fantasy. Viewers get excited all the time because the story cannot be true. I love SF movies because they make me smile every time. It is also cute that E.T. tries to study English through watching SESAME STREET.In conclusion, the story of this movie is about an alien and human boys.

"""E.T. I love you""","There's a certain age when film matters more than at any other time. A time when you lose sleep over Fenella the Witch from Chorlton and the Wheelies, or leave behind a worrying brown stain on the cinema seat after seeing the flying monkeys in The Wizard of Oz. E.T. was one such time. Never mind that nowadays it's full of sentimentality and overdone comic setpieces, E.T. is 1982, and you're back to being a ten-year-old, trying to not cry when E.T. dies just in case your big sister catches you.I've always had a slight problem with Spielberg's direction. Somehow, his films always seem too glossy, too clean. Even Schindler's List and Amistad had a clinical air, while the director chose Tom Hanks and Ted Danson to wage war in Saving Private Ryan. A case of the bland leading the bland? And so it is with E.T., possessing some very nice shots, but all put together with the maturity of an eight-year-old. Maybe that's the point. Spielberg loves referencing all the old films, such as Some Like It Hot, and, most obviously, Star Wars. If his childlike construction bores in Jurassic Park, then it's perfectly at home here.E.T. is, like Speilberg's other great success, Jaws, manipulative and ultimately hollow. With it's $704,800,000 takings, the film is still the seventh most successful of all time, and it's to the producers' eternal credit that they never called for sequels. Imagine a world where we got ""E.T. 3-D"" or a story where E.T. travels from world to world in a personal vendetta against Michael Caine.E.T. himself is a wonderful creation, though he does look worrying like Jack Nance's mutant baby from Eraserhead when ill. With his blinking eyes and expressive voice, coupled with incidental noises that sound like a crying baby and a kitten, he's a credit to the special effects team. Ageing less well are the floating special effects, be it E.T. making lumps of plasticine hover in the air, or the flying bicycles. They look like they were done on 50p and a roll of sellotape, but they were excellent at the time of release, and that's when it really mattered.As an adult, you appreciate other things about the film, such as the family dysfunction, the reasonable performances, or the mental symbiosis between E.T. and Elliot. When I first saw this film I must confess I couldn't understand why they acted so alike, and thought the scene where Elliot copies whatever the drunken E.T. watches on the TV was contrived. Hey, I was ten, what do you expect? I was going to sit in the cinema musing over whether it's a religious analogy? E.T. dies, I sniffled, end of story.Since this film, the cast haven't been able to recreate such a high-profile appearance, with Michael (Robert MacNaughton) only appearing in one cinema film since. Drew Barrymore, of course, since being told by E.T. to ""be good"", has appeared in Playboy, attended lots of open-minded showbiz parties (allegedly, allegedly) and gone on to be the most famous exponent of the film, appearing in Scream, Never Been Kissed, and many more. Her appearance in ""Bad Girls"" is quite ironic as her character in E.T., Gertie, spends most of the time wanting to be a cowgirl.E.T. himself had a brief comeback to the high-life (or, at least, three of his brothers did) in a four-second cameo in The Phantom Menace. Since then he's been resurrected in England to plug a phone company. As for his sole starring role, as an adult it's still a pretty decently made, if cynical, picture. For the ten-year-old back in 1982, it's perfection.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Drew Draws,"In my book, Spielberg made one movie worth watching: ""Close Encounters."" Its in the French tradition, and really has some depth.

As I write this, she is actually someone in the industry who knows her craft, understands her limits, readily exploits her strengths and seems to do intelligent and hard things.Its sad seeing this, watching a filmmaker die (represented by the ""scientist"" who can only watch and record while important things happen without him).

I Loved It.,E.T. The Extra Terresrial.Okay first of all I would like to say this was the best Drew Barrymore kid movie ever. I liked it because E.T. was so cool in this movie and I liked him so much. I saw it when it released on VHS in probably the 80's but I loved it. I think it. I think that the sci fi thing was great I know it was. and this isn't thge good time to talk about the actors but Henry Thomas was great in it. I think flower films produced this or did it?????????????????????????????????????????????????????? Well this movie was great I would give it an 10.10 I think that Drew is Cool too in this movie that is why I like it.Stay Cool Major Payne.........,7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Endearing!,"Knowing to me this is like the G-rated version of the X-Files. But this has a lot of heart. You got a young boy named Elliot(Henry Thomas) who goes out on a quest with the others. Then one night, he throws a ball out into the shed, and he's freaked. Later out in the field, he's sees a strange creature shrieking at him. That creature was an alien botanist who is simply known as E.T. That same night E.T. retrieves the Reese's Pieces Candy that was left on the ground earlier. The government where on the trail of E.T., one of them finds the candy and samples it. Keeping E.T. from the government is one thing, keeping it from the mom is another. The older brother and sister Gertie(Drew Barrymore) both meet the creature and reacted the same way Elliot did. Now all three have met it, they take equal actions for its well being. With all the fun they have, one will learn after the other. E.T.: ELLIOT, E.T. PHONE HOME, and OUCH. I bet each one have their own talent as well. There was plenty of everything, drama, comedy, love, and intrigue. The ending was a tear-jerker, but who says it had to end on a sad note? Not me. This movie here is really fun for the whole family, and for all ages. 5 Stars!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Stupid Alien Tricks,"Amazingly successful movie about a boy and his alien gets off to an OK start but becomes increasingly annoying, thanks to a stupid and overly sentimental script and Spielberg's manipulative yet amateurish direction. Even setting aside the alien story, the situations are so contrived that they insult the viewer's intelligence. ET seems to have been given random and contradictory features and powers. The federal authorities, who apparently don't say a word to each other, are basically like robots. The part where ET gets sick and the feds put on the astronaut suits is utterly ridiculous. Williams's score is memorable if overused to pull emotional strings.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The little alien that could.,"Edit: I've finally seen the original version. Scroll to the bottom to read my updated thoughts.Right up front, it's worth mentioning that the only version of 'E. T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982)' I've ever seen is the 'George Lucas'-style 'Walkie Talkie' cut, which sadly sees a lot of the previously practical eponymous alien replaced with an uncanny and rubbery CG thing that scares far more than it endears. Having said that, there's still a lot of effects work that, well, works and E. T. itself is as believable a character as any other in the movie. The thing has its lion's share of iconic, genre-defining moments and much of it works really well. The kids give good performances, the script balances humour and heart and the narrative is relatively breezy. It's an enjoyable flick from start to end. However, it never quite connects as much as it perhaps ought to. It's never boring, of course, but it isn't always entirely gripping. Still, it's an entertaining and effective family film. It's good, but not great.I've now seen the original version, which is a noticeably better cut, even though the other version isn't bad. The original just feels more tactile and natural, without any special effects that feel anachronistic and break the milieu. Generally, the piece now connects more with me, too. It's just delightful, isn't it? It's very well directed and beautifully shot, has a strong sense of atmosphere (especially in its moody opening movement), features a surprisingly strong core performance, contains believable effects work, and centres on a story in which the illegal alien isn't the bad guy (an important message that hasn't lost an ounce of its relevancy). It's a classic. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Liked It As A Kid, Love It Now","E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) is a Family Sci-Fi film starring Henry Thomas and directed by Steven Spielberg. It's about an alien being who was left behind on Earth when his spaceship took off after almost being discovered by human beings. He hides out until they leave until he is finally seen by a young boy named, Elliot. After learning how to speak, E.T. tells the 3 children that he wants to phone home and they try and find a way to help him. This film was entertaining, well-written, well-performed and it is an overall amazing production. The best components of E.T. the Extra- Terrestrial are the music, the characters, and the actors.The music is dramatic and majestic. It adds the perfect amount it magic to the scene that it is added to and enhances the overall message of the film. As Elliot is trying his best to walk around quietly and not be seen by the others, there is very soft and light piano music playing and as he is healed by E.T, the music increases slightly in volume and tempo as the two new friends watch his mom and sister read a bedtime story.The 3 main characters in the film: Elliot, Michael, and Gertie are all imperfect and likable. Elliot is seen bragging about discovering E.T. and making Michael say that he has absolute power in order to reveal his discovery. He is also very smart and compassionate. Michael seems to be a big bully at first as he is seen making fun of Elliot. Upon meeting E.T., Michael slowly begins to reveal his soft side. The youngest sibling, Gertie, is naive, yet persistent. All 3 siblings are helpful and stubborn.The actors who were cast to play the 3 main characters were an amazing choice. Even though they are all so young, they are able to convey the wants and needs of their characters. While Elliot is in class about to begin dissecting frogs, E.T. is sitting at home on the couch drinking beers. Even though Elliot is not even in the same building as E.T., you can immediately see that he is beginning to see the effects of the alcohol that E.T. is drinking even though it had not been said yet. Henry Thomas, the actor who plays Elliot, portrays this with his posture and facial expression.I am awfully glad that I gave this film a re-watch as it is even better than I remember it. I had heard that this film is overrated but I would have to disagree. As the film continues, E.T., the character that will make you fall in love, gets increasing more Ill. The 3 siblings are unsure what to do and how to help him. Will E.T. ever get home? Why is E.T. sick? Is it too late to save him? Will he find a new home on Earth?",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""ET Phone Home""","I really wanted to like this film - along with many other pre-teens I saw it when it was first released and although some scenes remained in my mind (ET amongst the toys in the cupboard; the bike ride up in the sky; ET's squeaky voice) I was largely bored with it.Twenty years later I tried to watch it again (this time with Spielberg's changes such as guns becoming flashlights). Although there is no denying that the relationship between the stumpy legged alien with the wide face and the human children is a nice touch, and that the little fella is a cutie, the film just doesn't have anything to say to me.The kids - Henry Thomas and Drew Barrymore - were fairly good, but not enough to keep the interest throughout. It is far too long before ET comes on to screen to keep the interest of its target audience, and the adults are just that little bit one-note.Cut through the hype and you might find this a bit dull, I'm afraid.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"E.T. is as loving, loyal and cosy as your family dog","In Steven Spielberg's esteemed fantasy classic, alien visitors from outer space aren't only more advanced than us intellectually, but they are also as loving, loyal and cosy as your family dog. It was the perfect concoction for both kids and their parents, who desperately wanted for their children's future to be bright and optimistic and not bleak like Cold War era politics. Seen today, E. T. has acquired that attractive position of standing with one foot in a time when children were biking around in suburbian streets trying to kill time and discover the world, and the other foot in a future in which we need to look for alternative solutions to an increasing amount of challenges as a species. Around halfway through, the film goes from cuteness to weightiness, from entertainment to message. And here is Spielberg's biggest achievement; he lifts E. T. from a cute, well-told children's story to a multifaceted experience, without losing sight of his motif or his target-audience. With fine, sympathetic performances by the children, all of whom seem to have enjoyed this experience immensely. The wonderful, CGI-less special-effects were created by the award-winning SFX-artist Carlo Rambaldi, who had already won an Academy Award for his work on Alien.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I would have enjoyed the movie a bit more if his design was more likeable and abstract, although with this design I didn't really detest it, I was just amused by how comically creepy he looked. Overall though, I did find the movie enjoyable. The human characters were all loveable (although they screamed and repeated themselves a lot) especially Gerty who was just absolutely adorable.

There's just no denying the magic of this film's appeal to the emotions,"It's hard to quantify what's so magical about a Steven Spielberg film. No one has directed and produced so many broad-appeal, family- centered movies as consistently well as he has. ""E.T. the Extra- Terrestrial"" combines the best of his family-friendly sensibilities with his interest in aliens and adventure stories.One might argue Spielberg's openness to engage new filmmaking technologies and big, daring projects has been a leading cause of his success, but that doesn't explain the enduring appeal of films like ""E.T.,"" the ""Indiana Jones"" films, ""Jurassic Park"" and more. These films have aged impressively well despite the huge leaps in visual and special effects Hollywood has experienced in the last 30- some years.""E.T."" is a reminder that Spielberg's secret lies in his stories and their ability to tap into ideas and feelings that are so fundamentally human. This little alien is a stand-in for your childhood pet, favorite stuffed animal and best (real or imaginary) friend. That had a lot to do with why it ages so well. As a child, you relate to and connect to it; as an adult, you fondly remember those feelings.You can tell this is a Spielberg story despite the writing credit going exclusively to Melissa Mathison, but Mathison deserves credit for constructing the narrative in such a way that the plot matters so little to enjoying the film. Why something happens in this movie matters less than what. E.T.'s desire to go home is profound and resonant – we don't care about how he's able to pull together a ""phone"" from scratch. ""E.T."" comes alive in the moments when the characters discover and connect with this creature.Those moments are Spielberg's to own, but the script creates a simple conceit to move things forward, and that's a very basic notion that the adults are going to screw things up. That's the lone force of antagonism – the adults are going to find out about E.T. and they won't understand him and they'll ruin everything. The small touches of not showing most adults from the waist up or the kids' mom (Dee Wallace) being so caught up in her own head that she doesn't notice an alien walking around her house (and posing as her daughter at one point), drive these feelings home. The movie doesn't need a traditional antagonist to keep our attention for this reason.The child actors, namely Henry Thomas as Elliott and Drew Barrymore as the adorable Gertie, also have a lot to do with the success of ""E.T."" Spielberg has a knack for working with kids, but these kids had to really react like this animatronic puppet/sometimes short person in a suit was real, and had to form a genuine connection to it, and they do. Watching Elliott ball over E.T. is so relatable. Friendship and loss, having someone who understands you – these are fundamental pieces and challenges of growing up.The brilliance of the film comes in Spielberg's wrapping it into a science-fiction story. So many alien films before it (including Spielberg's own ""Close Encounters"" imagine what aliens might want if they came to earth. They were scary or at least suspenseful films. ""E.T."" twists all that upside-down. The ""Star Wars"" references in the film alone place the story in a world in which we have that concept of aliens and a love for this genre, which plenty of films have done since, but not so much in 1982. Add the touch of animatronics with the subtle facial and neck movements that make ""E.T."" stand out technically from ""Star Wars"" and other films, and you end up with what was a wholly unique yet completely familiar movie.The other factor to consider with a Spielberg movie is its John Williams score. The music here is highly reminiscent of Williams' work in ""Star Wars,"" but it plays such an integral role in the emotional moments. He and Spielberg are totally in sync. And frankly, scenes of kids flying on bikes would've been cheesy without the ""E.T."" theme to make them really soar. Spielberg's films have in many ways become synonymous with this majestic theme music in such a way that no one can compose like this for the movies anymore. You can't get away with it without being labeled an imitator.""E.T."" is a raw appeal to the emotions and surprisingly timeless despite the ways it has been associated with the '80s (Netflix's ""Stranger Things"" owes so much to it). There's an enduring magic in it that transcends time and generational gaps. To extend it much scrutiny as a film is to miss the power of its deeply human story.~Steven CThanks for reading!

The Man in the Moon,"Steven Spielberg has often described how unhappy he was after his parents' divorce in 1960. The future director had no-one to share his misery with, so instead he invented a cuddly little creature from outer space. And Spielberg didn't forget his made-up comrade. Years later, he presented Columbia Pictures with a proposal for a new film. A story about a kind-hearted alien who befriends an autistic child. The movie studio wasn't interested, though. They didn't believe the material had any commercial potential whatsoever.Fortunately, the management at Universal was of a different opinion. They allocated a budget of $10 million to the film and then used another $1.5 million to construct the director's little buddy from space. That job went to Carlo Rambaldi, who previously had designed the aliens for Spielberg's ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"". Rambaldi had to work on the creature for three months, though. It turned out to be really complicated to make its extendible neck function as intended.The E. T. actually existed in multiple forms. First, an animatronic figure, then a close-up version for facial expressions and finally a full-body costume with a little person inside. Spielberg constantly encouraged his young stars to act spontaneously. He also shot the entire film from such a low angle that the adult characters could rarely be seen from the waist up. The director wanted everything that happened in the movie to be perceived from a child's-eye view of the world.""E. T. The Extra-Terrestrial"" had its world premiere at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival in 1982. And it brought the house down. The film received a twenty-minute standing ovation. The success then continued back in the United States. The movie spent an extraordinary twelve consecutive weeks as number one at the American box office. At the end of the year, ""E. T. The Extra-Terrestrial"" was officially regarded as the highest-grossing picture of all time.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It never did.I just don't get it. Where is the magic? What is the appeal? The characters look like they just jumped out of a Tide commercial, and the dialogue from the Mickey Mouse Show. The special effects were anything but special.

Critically Acclaimed '80s Blockbuster,"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is timeless, visually impressive and directorially phenomenal, that being said, while I appreciate all the uniqueness of the film, I don't really understand the universal acclaim as one of the all-time greats in cinema, nor do I agree with those who claim it to be one of the best movies of the 1980s.Nevertheless, E.T. is a very enjoyable movie, a simple yet poetic story about loneliness. With a charming family-friendly basis coinciding with a not-so family friendly script, that is where the obscenities wear off and are replaced with a heartfelt story that anybody can enjoy. Even if you don't completely enjoy the film, you can still absorb the genius of Steven Spielberg and the incredibly impressive science fiction design of the focal alien 'E.T.'There isn't much else worth mentioning though, a stellar soundtrack is composed by the always-ambient John Williams, and the writing is worthwhile with a few quotable and memorable lines.

The Real Meaning of Spielberg's  Fantasy Masterpiece,"I saw ET at the premiere in 1982 and have not seen it since then until I picked up the DVD set a few days ago.  Without too much embellishment I have the same feeling for it now that I did then: this is one of the best motion pictures ever made. How could I have remembered every scene from 2 decades past, nearly every significant word of dialog, every note of the score, if it had made no impression on me from the first viewing? Because it went straight to the parts of me that define me as HUMAN. It would be pointless to over-critique ET; small and trivial aspects of it have lost their luster. So there is an ATARI console, so Drew Barrymore has taken on less sweet roles as an adult. The cheesy effects in The Wizard Of Oz do nothing to detract from the essence of the film. In this case the essence is the same: Home. It is a word that is as intangible to define as freedom or truth or....faith. ""Phone home"" he says, ""There's no place like home."" says Dorothy. THIS is the essence of the movie...it does not take a Roger Ebert or Leonard Matlin to uncover this fundamental (and yes, sentimental) truth. Spielberg captured all that was possible to capture on film about the nebulous nature of needing to be home. For each of us, for every human being, there is a place we call home. It may not be the place we live now, or it may not even exist anymore except in our memory, perhaps we shall never find such a place. But we all know what it shall be like when we are there. Spielberg's film says that the concept of home is not only a human desire, but perhaps even a universal one as well.I think he is right.I believe if you don't understand or feel these feelings after viewing then somewhere along the road of your life you have lost some part of your humanity. True,it is just a movie. And Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is just another song. And The Last Supper is just another fresco...",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

And then there's....don't get me wrong the actor who played Elliot is a Pretty Good Actor but it's that I think his Worst Scene is when he did that Fake Cry act on the Government. And speaking of I kind of have mixed feelings for them, in one hand they do come off as kind of smart but on the other hand they also come off as incredibly Dumb at the same time. Then there's the Fact that every kid in the town wanted to help Elliot help ET get back home they don't even know ET they haven't spent any time with ET. Although I get they're trying to give off the Feeling of 'United For A Single Purpose' and all it's just when it comes to the story it makes No Sense what so ever. And I guess goes with my complaint about both the mother and the government, but how is it that the Kids in the Film are way smarter than any of the adults in the film? Again I get it it's a movie for kids but still it's unrealistic even for film made for kids. That and you add to the Fact that the also comes off as Brats especially in the first act of the first act, the Older Brother Especially I should have added this fact in the beginning. And I just can't and don't connect with any of the characters not even with any of the kids, I can't even identify myself of any of the kids not even watching it when I was one. Anyways the finally complaint I have is that ET's Powers and Abilities just seems way Too Convenient to me.But at least it's not all Bad this film does have some Positives and hare they are. First I know what I said about the mother, but to me the only thing she did in the film that I actually like not only because it was actually smart of her for change but also it actually feels Natural for her reactions of finding out that her kids Befriended an alien. And then the next is that I really like the whole third act for the most part finally. And I really loved the Main Score it's iconic even to this day. Then there's the design of ET I think it's also iconic and not only that but it fits his character so well on so many levels. But for me what really saves it is the Final Scene where Elliot has to personally say Goodbye to ET it was like they where BBF's for years and know they have to say Goodbye to each other for good, it was really Emotional for me. I must admit I'm a sucker for those kinds emotions.And final thoughts Sadly it just seems that aside from what I said about the Final Scene of this film, the only other saving point is that it was the Number 1 Film in the year I was Born. I'm either not seeing it or it just didn't aged well sadly. I know a lot of people even today see it as a Classic and all of that, it's just that I don't see why. Even if it the reason is due to Nostalgia, again I don't see it like that despite watching it as a kid myself. That feeling just doesn't come up for me regarding this film.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The most overrated movie of all time!,When I first saw this movie I was a kid about 10-11 years old and I was excited about seeing it as it was raved about by so many people.  Even at that age which I assume is the demographic the movie was aimed at I found it extremely boring.I could not see why so many people rave about this film.  It was simply too boring to be considered great by any standards but I suppose there are a bunch of people who go around looking at boring movies and raving about artistic merit.This is simply one very boring movie and I can't see a lot of artistic merit to it either.

John Williams' score will enchant your inevitable innocent love of the stranded extra terrestrial,"One of Spielberg's masterpieces that he made at just the age of 35. This is one of my favourite Spielberg movies because it is what cinema and the movie experience is all about. The famous image of the bicycle flying past the luminous moon is only one of many great moments in this motion picture. No one can doubt ET's reasons for being a classic. Many more movies have attempted to emulate what Spielberg created but almost all of them have failed to reach ET's greatness.If I must stay away from praising then I'd say that personally, I don't believe the script is perfect from Melissa Mathison. However, I do believe that this film is great due to the collaboration of everyone involved and of course from Steven Spielberg's brilliant vision. Mathison's screenplay has wonderful moments and she has tied it all together expertly, however, there are just a few moments that I believe Spielberg has managed to not bring much attention to in his direction but that altogether fail to add to the wonder of ET. Looking back on the film makes me completely forget these moments though because the overall ride is too powerful and significant in my mind.This is not a film to keep the volume down for. You MUST have John William's score bursting out at you. I know this for certain as I have twice watched the movie at home and twice in the cinema, the effect of a cinema experience is so much greater that it will astound any viewer. My most recent experience was with an accompanying orchestra. The music reverberated around the theatre and wowed every single person sitting inside - everyone gave a standing ovation at the end. Seeing this at a theatre accompanied by a live orchestra was an incredible experience, you get a whole new appreciation for Williams' score. I believe that no score will ever add so much to a movie like it did for Jaws, however, this is still my personal favourite score from John Williams.Spielberg's movies, especially his blockbusting crowdpleasers, are not fantastic because of him alone but because of Spielberg and Williams. They are one of the greatest duos of American cinema. The second you see Spielberg and Williams' name come up on the screen you know you're in for a wonderful ride of entertainment in sight and sound. Not only this but Ben Burtt also worked on ET in developing the sound. Ben Burtt being the great sound designer who created the famous sounds that Star Wars is so well known for, now he is working on this little alien picture you know your ears are going to have a great time. Watching this on my TV late at night with the sound turned down diminished all the brilliant work of everyone that worked on this spectacle. If you really want to experience ET for what it is then you must see it in cinemas, or, at the very least, have your volume at maximum so John Williams' score will enchant your inevitable innocent love of the stranded extra terrestrial.Overall, one of Spielberg's best and maybe most iconic film. It deserves all the praise it gets and its IMDb rating should be much higher! Spielberg's greatest sci-fi!",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Probably one of the best 10 movies ever,"I went to see this movie in the theater about 20 years ago, and I found it magic. I think is the best Spielberg movie (with The Schindler's List) and one of the best 10 movies ever made. You cannot help to feel in both Elliot and ET's shoes, being connected to them like they are connected to each other. And it's probably the best movie for children ever made, now they make a lot of violent and superficial films for children and ET is a real classic that everyone should see at least once. It talks about friendship and tolerance, I give it 10 out of 10.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This movie still tugs at the heartstrings!,"E. T. is a timeless masterpiece that continues to resonate with me after all these years. Its enduring appeal lies in its unique blend of heartwarming sentiment and imaginative storytelling. The film's portrayal of an unlikely friendship between a lonely boy and an extraterrestrial is both touching and believable, thanks to the exceptional performances of Elliott played by Henry Thomas and the remarkably expressive E. T. puppet.What gets me about E. T. is its ability to evoke genuine emotion. The film masterfully captures the innocence and wonder of childhood, while also exploring themes of loneliness, acceptance, and the power of connection. Even after multiple viewings, the iconic scenes, such as E. T. Getting drunk and the bicycle chase still fill me with nostalgia.E. T. Is a film that reminds me of the importance of empathy, understanding, and the enduring loyalty of friendship.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Excellent and moving,"What would happen if aliens exist and one of them was found by a child alive and well, but lost on our planet and eager to return to his home? This is precisely the subject of this film, which is part of the collective memory of most people and that is undoubtedly one of the most notable films of Steven Spielberg's career. Directed by him and with a script by Melissa Mathison, this film has the participation of Henry Thomas (as Elliott) and Drew Barrymore (as Gertie). The alien's voice belongs to Pat Welsh, an old woman who smoked two packs of cigarettes daily just to achieve the hoarseness required for the role (at a time when technology wasn't what we have today, that's what was done, and I just hope she didn't suffer from the lungs later).Personally, I consider this the most remarkable film of Spielberg's career so far, despite the success he achieved before with ""Jaws"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" and even of many other blockbuster films he made after. Spielberg has always shown a particular talent for sci-fi themes, very present in his work and presented here at an audience younger than what is normally the target of alien movies. Despite the theme and suspense throughout the film, we can consider it a family film. The suspense alternates with very funny moments, where children (and their interaction with their new friend) reign at all. Drew Barrymore deserves particular attention: this lovely girl, screaming like a grown, won with this film a well deserved stardom, unfortunately tapped the hard way over the next decade in an absolutely downward path, which the actress has only recently recovered. Henry Thomas was also good in his role, grabbing it with vigor and commitment. The special effects, as usual in films of this director, are excellent and the soundtrack is one of the best of John Williams. Some of the scenes on this film became so famous that come naturally to our memory and are known even to those who have never seen the movie. This is the case of the flying bike passing in front of the full moon, one of the most beautiful and striking scenes in sci-fi, along with that famous scene where E.T. finger lights touching on Elliott's forehead.This film is recommended to all families of all ages. Its a truly timeless film, which was done without the massive computerization we are used to, which ends up being an advantage to make it more genuine. Moving and emotional, he entertains any audience so well that it's not surprising the huge success it had at the box office. Winner of Oscars for Best Soundtrack, Best Special Effects, Best Sound Effects and Best Sound (1983), it also won the Golden Globes for Best Dramatic Film and Best Soundtrack. This is that sci-fi film that will decidedly please even those who don't appreciate this kind of movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I am a big fan of Steven Spielburg and enjoy most of his films but this one just lost me. However I can respect the fact that many other people have really enjoyed this film and I am not really criticizing them at all, I am simply saying that it was lost on me.

A friend from outer space,"With this film for all audiences, Steven Spielberg managed to reach the heart of each and every one of the spectators who were lucky enough to enjoy it, because above all, E.T. Is an emotional film in which to more than one, it becomes a knot in the throat watching the final scenes. We are before a beautiful song to the friendship and to a friendship beyond the borders, because it has like protagonists to a boy and a friendly and endearing extraterrestrial. This adorable fable is full of magic, of unforgettable moments, of unrepeatable dialogues and it is a story wisely told, that no doubt chills inside the public. In it also comedy and drama, action and pause, fiction and reality coexist and, if that were not enough, the soundtrack is authentically masterful. So look at it wherever you look, we are before one of the great jewels that has given the history of the cinema, so there is no reason not to see it and not to be touched by the adventures of an alien, who went beyond The stars to excite us and to tear us a smile. In my case at least, he got it.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
ET - A Classic of Sci-Fi,"This is Spielberg's classic of science-fiction. He made another masterpiece in 1977, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, but it did not have the emotional intensity of this ET film. This film does not have the action of films within the Indiana Jones franchise that started a year earlier, but it does have more emotional intensity. Both approaches to film are fine if carried out properly.In this one, Spielberg leaves no heart string untugged. He goes for the throat of human emotion and hits a bullseye. This is not an easy feat to accomplish; especially in the science fiction genre. All of the performances are first-rate and Richard Thomas does an admirable job in a key role. The people responsible for the special effects that produced ET did an outstanding job. See this one again.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It didn't take me long to realize it's because at the time of it's release, there was nothing else like it. At least nothing that I've seen before. Since it's release, there have been SO many movies, TV shows and media copies, that to me, the story has been way overdone in the 38 years since.

Classic tale of boy befriends alien,"This is a truly touching film and proof that sci fi can have as much, if not more, heart than any drama in the film world.E.T. wants to phone home. He is lost and afraid in his new world, our world. He is short, wrinkly, bug-eyed, yet somehow adorable, and easily befriends his human friend Elliot who cares about him and wants him to survive on Earth.This beautiful story has a lot of depth to it. Elliot and E.T.'s friendship is a model for many successful relationships we desire and strive for. We all want a companion, and E.T. being an alien somehow makes us want to strive for better relationships on Earth.The terrifying sequence involving the scientists at the end doesn't paint the most positive picture of scientific progress, and ironically makes science itself seem somewhat ""evil"" in a science fiction film.

1982 was the best year,"Is a very interesting story about a friendly gentle alien getting lost in Planet Earth, and it is executed very well and it is one of the most memorable premises in the history of cinema.The film has a lot of memorable and loveable characters, such as:
E. T. is a lovable short brown extraterrestrial, and a very smart, but childlike and curious creature who learns how to adapt to human life very quickly, how to communicate, and even builds a device that will help send him home.Elliott Taylor is a 10-year-old boy who lived with his family in Los Angeles, California, and he must find a way to help E. T. return home while avoiding the government.The actors did a really good job performing as Mary Taylor, Elliott Taylor, Michael Taylor, etc..
It had some great special effects for its time.The iconic scene of Elliott and E. T.'s flight across the moon was called the most magical moment in cinema history.Although it has a lot of product placement (especially Reese's Pieces), it is used efficiently and subtly unlike the 1988 rip-off film Mac and Me.It had a beautiful musical score by none other than the legendary John Williams and was his fifth collaboration with Spielberg, after 1981's Raiders of the Lost Ark and the 1979 period comedy film 1941.Amazing cinematography.Fantastic directing by Steven Spielberg.It also had some great and memorable quotes like ""E. T. phone home"".The poster, based on Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling piece, is well drawn and is one of the most iconic movie posters of all time, and has become the face of Amblin Entertainment.The ending scene where E.

A film captivating for all ages,"In films aliens can perform different roles. They can be aggresive (""Mars attacks"", 1996, Tim Burton) or, on the contrary, just wise and peaceful (""The day the earth stood still"", 1951, Robert Wise). In other instances the aliens are methaphors for other anxieties (""Invasion of the body snatchers"", 1956, Don Siegel). In few films the aliens are just aliens, and that is exactly what is the case in ""E.T."", in which the alien is literally lost on earth after not having reached his spaceship in time.Films in which aliens are just aliens often are told from the perspective of the child. They are situated in a world where the disenchantment inexorably linked to growing up has not yet taken place. ""E.T."" is no exception to this rule. Spielbrg uses a number of ways to make this clear.In the first place the whole film is shot from the point of view (POV) of either ET or Elliott (the boy that befriends the alien). In the second place in a couple of funny scenes it is ""proved"" that grown ups (i.e. the mother of Elliott) can't see ET. First see looks constantly the other way when unpacking groceries. Later see overlooks ET when she thinks he is another stuffed animal. Finally there grows a sort of telepathy between ET and Elliott. It is however not a telepathy of thoughts but a telepathy of feelings (in my opinion the original meaning of this word, because ""tele"" is distance and ""pathos"" means feelings).The consequence of using a POV of a child and a little creature is that grown ups are seen on waist height. With the exception of the mother of Elliott, until very late in the film we never see their face or eyes. This make them some kind of threatening, what already begins in the (marvelous) opening scene with the men hunting the spaceship.Some days ago I reviewed a film of Robert Bresson. Bresson is a director who tries to manipulate the emotions of the viewers as little as possible. At the other hand of the spectrum we have Steven Spielberg, who knows exactly how to manipulatie the emotions of the spectators. In ""E.T."" he does so masterly, from the opening to the ending.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I did not grow up watching this film as much as Spielbergs other fantastic works, but watching it again I am reminded of how great this movie is.It is arguably one of Spielbergs most perfect films, as the themes, music, acting, and virtually every component blends together beautifully. While the effects might not measure up against modern standards, they do the job and fit the look and feel of the movie. From the iconic across the moon sequence to the dramatic climax, the film is not just fantastic for the imagination of a child, but to adults as well. The themes of love, friendship, and trust, universally appeal and attribute to the film's timelessness. The curiosity of ET, and his relationship with Elliot, is irresistible and is one of the best examples in cinema of a man and his best friend type of relationship (a kid and his alien in this case).The movie is also very powerful, as the perfect themes from John Williams elevate the emotional feel of the movie.

He also looks at it as a sequel of sorts to ""Close Encounters.""The BluRay disc is packed with ""extras"", in total running longer than the movie itself. I watched parts of all of them.

A near-perfect film for any age.,"For most directors, a film like E.T. The Extra Terrestrial would mark the pinnacle of their filmography. It is a near perfect movie in every way. The effects are well- executed, the cast - both child and adult - are perfect in their roles (young Drew Barrymore is absolutely adorable), and not a minute of the two-hour run-time feels wasted.Spielberg is a masterful storyteller, adding little touches that elevate this simple story to being an unforgettable classic.Whether young or old, E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial deserves your attention.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"I think I now do ""Get it""... it really is garbage.","You know, as a kid my fondest memories revolve around films I had the pleasure (or displeasure) of seeing on home video. My dad would never take us to see films in the theatre so of course I had to wait for home video of E.T., but in all that time considering the way he was merchandised I wondered at even a young age: is this actually a good movie or a ploy to sell Reeces pieces? Well, I can honestly say that the first time I finally saw the film I was more than a bit confused... just what was so special about it? Consider, E.T. is probably the single most ignorant looking creature ever seen in a film. The film went overboard in the way it portrayed The relationship with the alien, almost in a homoerotic way... it seemed that they were just TOO close, but hey I guess I'm being a cynic. Now this masterpiece of fluff has been released, and what's different? Not much, unfortunately... Spielberg showed just what kind of a director he is by butchering his own original work, but after some of the pathetic films he has helmed I suppose he could care less just as long as the money comes rolling in. And roll in it will, this film really is nothing more than a vehicle to sell endorsements and toys, it has little redeeming value other than the fact that it might keep your 2 year old at bay for at least the duration, and that it makes ol' Steven more cash to throw around. I really hope he leaves the Indiana Jones films alone once they hit DVD, but digress... he will probably squeeze them dry of life as well. In closing I would just like to say that this film is terrible, it lacks in story, goes overboard in its melodrama to the point of nausea, and most importantly it actually CHEATS the viewer by just bringing the alien back to life out NOWHERE thus defeating the only really good thing in film: his death. If you want to see masterful directing go find some Akira Kurosawa, Hiyao Miyazaki or George Romero because unlike Spielberg they know how to tell a beautiful story without killing the human element or ruining the premise via over commercialization.

*Chef's kiss*,"Not surprisingly, Jaws and E. T. the Extra-Terrestrial made for an incredible double-feature tonight. The latter I've always been more fond of, but the former might be ""more"" perfect, if that makes sense? Objectively, Jaws is better I think, but subjectively, my heart says E. T. the Extra-Terrestrial. But, more importantly, both are phenomenal however you want to judge them and, like Jaws, E. T. the Extra-Terrestrial is another film where looking for flaws takes a lot of brainpower, and turns up a couple of nitpicks at best.I know some find E. T. horrific, and that kills the movie for them, but I feel like he becomes endearing as the film goes along. That's one of the bigger strengths here, and I don't know how they did it, just from a writing perspective. Melissa Mathison was the credited writer of one of Spielberg's best (this one) and one of his worst (The BFG). It's funny to compare them, and I think The BFG almost asks you to, being set the year E. T. came out (1982), and also having a story about a child befriending something otherworldly. Titles are kind of similar too, now that I think about it (and I know The BFG is based on a book, but just roll with it). Problem is with The BFG, the title character sucks and is annoying. There are other problems with The BFG, of course.There are no real problems with E. T. the Extra-Terrestrial. It's got a pace that seems measured by modern standards; I won't say ""slow."" But every scene has value on multiple levels, and I think the emotional pay-offs and more exciting moments of the final act wouldn't resonate nearly as much without the more careful, suspenseful, and intimate first two acts.I'm also blown away more than before by how well all the effects for E. T. were done. The only time it didn't feel like a real being was when Elliott's brother finds in that river/ditch. Otherwise, it's technically amazing. I don't really know how they did a lot of it, a bit like how I still find the special effects in Little Shop of Horrors uncannily good. That one was another recent rewatch, so it's been on the mind.Yes, so that's E. T. What else can be said. It's perhaps the best live-action family film of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A classic that still works... 😊,I just revisited this movie with my kids (8 and 5 years old). They were skeptical at first but afterwards the 5 year old directly wanted to re-watch it again and the 8 year old (used to alot more action) admitted that it was good.And for me it was a golden opportunity to re-visit my childhood... and also fun to notice more details how new movies and series borrowed things from this classic.,8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

One of Spielberg's best,"It may not be as obvious today as when the movie was made, but ET remains one of the very few alien movies in which the alien is not a threat to humanity. What a novel idea! And what a wonderful way to explore human themes, including the paranoia that if aliens do exist, then they must surely mean us some harm or otherwise be harmful. But it goes far deeper than that, commenting on lost innocence of adults and the need at times to perhaps rely more on the approach of the innocent, approaching the new with wide eyes but without fear or preconceptions. But, hey, never mind all the heavy stuff, ET is just plain a good, fun, funny story, a romp with a tremendous imagination and great acting and directing. And if you're looking to buy it, get the updated version. . . It's actually better than the original, Spielberg having included a couple more scenes left out of the original which improve the continuity, and subtle but effective updating of ET's facial expressions, thanks to more modern computer graphic capabilities. It's a rare instance in which the revised version after the fact is a big improvement rather than a detriment.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Commercial and Overrated,"I have seen this movie twice.The first time was when I was a kid and it was a lot of fun. The second time as an adult it merely irritates me with its clichés and cheesy sentimentalism. Movies like this seem to rely on the stereotypes we have about aliens. A flying disc,a creature with big head,2 eyes ,long neck . The score of J.Williams is awful. If not for the camera work and some effects this movie would have been a B-movie.

The only Spielberg I really like,"Commenting on this one is maybe a bad idea, for what new thing can I say about it ? But I finally managed to watch Drews first successful movie, so I will just drop another note about it.I've seen quite a lot movies of Spielberg, and I'm definitely not fan of this director. Jaws was boring, Jurassic Park was simply crap, Saving Private Ryan was far too pathetic, and A.I. was boring, crap and pathetic. So I personally don't know why Spielberg is so successful. But this one here works.Good suspense, funny, with sympathy to its figures, and with a positive message, at the same time entertaining for adults and kids. How much better can a movie be ?Okay, it was again pathetic. But it had a lot more story than Saving Private Ryan, and it wasn't pathetic about the US.I don't know the original, so I can't comment on the differences between the original and the directors cut.Recommended unless you consider good entertainment with a positive message a sin.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Sci fi fairy tale with everyone's favorite alien,"This is a wonderful fun, heartwarming fairy tale of a story for both kids and adults. In terms of a cute science fiction story, no one has ever been able to touch Stephen Spielberg's classic.The fairy tale begins when some alien botanists visiting earth for samples inadvertently leave behind one of their own on this strange, bewildering new planet. The adorable little alien critter is discovered by a 10 year old boy named Elliot, who finds him foraging for food in their garden shed. The friendly alien (ET, as he comes to be called, for Extra Terrestrial) comes to stay in the boy's home. Elliot, his older brother, Michael, and younger sister, Gertie, sort of take him under their wing. But as they learn to communicate, they discover that ET is lonesome. He wants to go home, and to that end, concocts some type of device he thinks might help get him there. However, if he succeeds, Elliot (whose own parents are going through a divorce) will lose his new friend.It's all too cute, especially the little alien guffer himself. Basically, he kind of represents every homesick kid (or adult) who ever lived. Despite his newfound human friends, he just misses his own home world and fellow critters. Memorable scenes for me are of course the legendary ones...ET hiding among the stuffed animals and assorted junk in a closet so Elliot's mom won't spot him, Halloween trick or treating, and the famed flying bicycle scene. And of course the ongoing ""ET go home"".Great acting by everyone, especially the three kids. ET is simply a fabulous movie with some fancy modern effects and a space age theme, but mainly a story about the bonds of friendship revolving around a touching little guy that needs love and help from his new earthling buddy. It makes you laugh, it makes you cry...just like any truly good movie should. This is one that perennially appeals to the kid in all of us.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the best films ever made & a personal fave,"E.T. THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL (1982) **** Henry Thomas, Dee Wallace, Robert McNaughton, Drew Barrymore, Peter Coyote, Tom Howell (C. Thomas Howell), KC Martel, Sean Frye, Erika Eleniak. Steven Spielberg's classic sci-fi masterpiece about a lonely boy (Thomas in a remarkably natural debut) who befriends a stranded, freightened alien and the bond that strengthens between the two. Fantastic special effects, John Williams' heart warming score, and Carlo Rambaldi's creation of E.T. earned Oscars as well as for sound, stand out as well as Melissa Mathison's (that's Mrs. Harrison Ford to you!) wonderful script conveys beautifully how the human spirit can truly be. Speaking of spiritual, it is somewhat surprising just how spiritual the film is (i.e.: E.T.'s healing powers and 'resurrection'). Memorable scenes: E.T.'s getting drunk and Thomas sharing his feelings (particularly the wonderful set up to his kiss with the towering Eleniak {who would be best known as the gravity-defying Elly May Clampett in the big screen version of ""The Beverly Hillbillies""}); Wallace not noticing E.T. on Halloween; E.T. fixing Thomas' ""ouch""; and one for the film vaults: the flight of the bicycles. In a word: perfect. ** incidentally I first saw this when I was 14 and the day I saw it my mom informed me and my sister she was divorcing my dad, so I totally relate to Thomas. ** Noteworthy trivia: yes that is Debra Winger's voice as one of the many elements that went into the voice of E.T.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""Come."" ""Stay.""","These two words spoken by E.T. and Elliott, respectively, is the heart of this beautiful fable of a young boy and his meeting and eventual love for an extra-terrestrial being.Elliott's (Henry Thomas) love is returned in full by E.T., hence E.T.'s desire for Elliott to come home' with him.This makes for a delightful story with all the suspense, laughter and devotion that any good film could ever have.The interaction between Elliott and his family is so finely fashioned that it is completely believable.  (The torturing of the doll brought back a few memories.) There is a truth to their interactions that adds so much to the believability of the film.Just because a movie relies on children to tell a story doesn't make it a children's film.  While this is a family film' there are some issues around language and the death of E.T. that the parents of some children may find objectionable.  Also, parents that cannot control their children should not bring them to a theater where people are actually trying to quietly enjoy a movie.The new revamped Twentieth Anniversary edition of this film classic adds a few scenes, digitally expands on the facial and body movements of E.T. (which couldn't be done with the puppet in the original filming) and removes the guns in one scene.  I must admit that when I saw this film when it came out in 1982 the thought that the children were, on some level, threatened with guns bothered me.  I am glad to see that they are gone.When this film came out it added the `E.T., phone home.' phrase to the American lexicon.The stirring score was the product of the genius of film music: John Williams.  He is a national treasure.This is a brilliant film with a good story and a great message and is certainly worth revisiting. It is a classic for all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
How to fall in love with an Alien?,"With E.T., Spielberg had us made our 'first contact' with an alien on a personal level. Though he brought us close with his encouter of the third kind, in E.T. he pored the soul of an Alien right in to our hearts. What at first looks like a ugly creature, becomes a good friend during the movie.It's not the special effects that makes E.T. so great, but much more the depth of characters. The meaning of the word soulmates gets a whole new dimension. For me E.T. was an instant classic, the moment I saw it for the first time. Although some might consider that this film is a tearjerker, I believe that E.T. (and his well casted friends) are worth every tear you shed. E.T. is a heartfelt and impressive film about friendship that easily sustains the wear and tear of time.Besides that: it's just a fun movie to see for both young and old!10 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Most people love this but to me, it's trite","I remember back in 1982 when E.T. came out, I was very young and most probably the target audience for this movie. I recall going over to a neighbour's house and watching it on pirate video (I think that E.T. was the most pirated video ever). I was pretty excited to see it. In the event my neighbours all were in floods of tears, as I sat there strangely, yet deeply unimpressed with what I had just seen. I don't know what it is but I have revisited this film again a further couple of times in the last three years or so and I still come away somewhat ambivalent and unmoved. Maybe I am dead behind the eyes? I must be going by the reaction most people seem to have to this movie. But I can't change my reaction no matter how I try and find this to be overly sentimental and slightly tiresome. It's not that I don't like Steven Spielberg – I think on his day he can be great – but he sometimes makes films so twee in nature as to be very off-putting.It also sort of baffles me how E.T. himself can be such a super-intelligent being when he allows himself to be led up a staircase by a child via a line of sweeties. That surely is the behaviour of a creature with an IQ no greater than a domestic dog and not a galaxy-hopping alien, surely? And why hasn't his alien race invented clothing? We have people on earth who go out in public in the nude but we throw them in prison on the grounds of mental illness.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Still one of the greats,"An alien being is left behind when his compatriots take off without him. He is hounded by humans but he escapes. Elliott (Henry Thomas) is a 10 year old boy with a rambunctious family. He finds the little alien hiding in the woods behind his family home. Nobody believes him. Not his single mother (Dee Wallace), not his older brother (Robert MacNaughton), nor his cute little sister (Drew Barrymore).Spielberg got the visual style with the beautifully shot backyard with the light streaming from the shed. He's got the emotional touch with the boy and alien relationship. And he's got the comedic touch with Drew screaming at the alien. This is a beautifully put together story. Henry Thomas' performance draws you into his character. The pacing is good. The camera work is thoroughly modern. The jokes are still funny. The emotional payoff is still powerful. It is a modern classic.I watched the redux version again recently, and it's interesting to see the intention of Spielberg with a CGI alien. I do miss the animatronic ET sometimes. And sure there are the minutia of gun or no gun controversy. But the story still remains. And that's the best part of the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Best Movie Ever Made -- EVER!!!,"I love many films.  The Godfather, Citizen Kane, Casablanca and scores of others are all masterpieces.

Pretty much everything in this movie is flawless.  Henry Thomas brings in a performance of a 10-year-old boy mature beyond his years.  The John Williams score is among one of his best.

These types of Hollywood fables are best left to the Disney animation studios.  Or better yet, ask a true film artist like surrealist Jan Svankmajer to redo E.

"Thrilling, wonderful, uplifting - and just very, very good","Picture the scene. It is 1982. Three 19 year old young men decide to go to the cinema to find out what all the fuss is about.

As we are waiting, the audience from the previous showing file out past us, nearly all in tears. We pay our money and take our seats. The house is packed. And, for the duration of the film, everyone is enthralled by the simple but beautiful story that plays out on the screen. The audience laughs, cries, whoops and gasps as one.

A Timeless Masterpiece By A Timeless Genius,"Steven Spileberg has show that he is one of the best filmmakers around, and I think this movie shows the best of his abilities.It tells us the story of the relationship between ET, and extraterrestrial who was left on Earth by accident, and Elliot and his family, who find him in their garden and try to keep him safe. The story is fantastic, really well told and I think it transmits you a lot of emotions. It makes you laugh and cry just in side by side scenes and that's a really impressive thing.The actors were amazing. Here the trues stars are the children. Henry Thomas as Elliot was amazing. He gave a really powerful performance and was the highlight of the cast. But also Drew Barrymore as Gertie is fantastic. She steals every scene where she appears and she is really cute and funny. The adults here does not have a really big role, but mainly the mother of these kids, played by Dee Wallace, has a great part too.Spileberg's direction in this movie has provided some of the most iconic shots in film history (just that bike flying over the moon is a true perfect shot). Those visuals are fantastic and that is in a big part, because of John Williams. That man reached one of his master jobs in here. The score is perfect to the movie and just listening to the fantastic Adventures on Earth you will get goosebumps.This movie is really one of those classics that you will watch more than one time with your family, and each time you watch again, you will still enjoy it as much as the first time.

E.T. big joke,"I cannot watch E.T. without constantly laughing and rolling my eyes at scenes in this movie. E.T. has to be the most over-hyped, over-dramatized, commercialized, movie that was ever made. This movie is simple proof of what paying the media to hype a movie can get you. E.T. is really nothing more than a dramatic commercial for things like Reese's Pieces and BMX bikes.I think Steven Spielberg gets a lot more credit than he truly deserves, especially with E.T. Steven Spielberg doesn't make these stories believable (as so many people claim), he just makes everything extremely dramatic. The scene in E.T. where the scientists come into the house wearing space suits (by the way his mother is the first to see the suits), is beautiful proof of this. I think this also applies to the scene where they're trying to escape with E.T., and Eliot's brother says ""I've never driven forward before!"" Driving forward is the first thing you learn how to do in driving! Plus, he drives forward after backing out of the driveway earlier in the movie. I also love the Halloween eve where E.T. sees a kid dressed as Yoda from Star Wars and screams ""home!"", in the same part of the movie E.T. uses the umbrella with crumbled foil for a satellite dish, it's all absolutely comical. And E.T. can't beam up to the space ship because ""this is reality, Greg"", yet he can make all of the kids riding bikes float above the neighborhood from a clear blue sky through a dramatic sunset?This movie is labeled as science-fiction.

Or hating the message of the film so much that they start attacking its technical merits. That's just beyond me. The direction of children is a most difficult thing and Spielberg pulls it off superbly. Cinematography is top notch, giving us the best signature shot of all time.

Wonderful,"No film will ever effect me as much as E.T done. I was nine years old when I seen this in the cinema in 1982, it moved me so much its probably responsible for my love of cinema. I couldn't get enough of E.T after I watched it, E.T toys, E.T soap, E.T sweets etc etc, yes I know it was just a huge cash in, but I was just a kid not the sceptical 29 year old I am now! One reason this film grew to mythical status with me as well, was the fact that it took YEARS to come out on video, and when I did see it again, I was slightly disappointed because in my head I had built it up so much, and I never did get to see it on those legendary pirate copies that passed from kid to kid and workmate to workmate. Everyone must know the story by now, Alien gets deserted on earth and is befriended by young boy. The film is wonderfully made, the effects are amazing, the performers are brilliant, the music is fantastic, Spielbergs direction is genius...you may have noticed by now I liked this film! The scene where Elliot is cyling his bike through the woods with E.T, and they take off and fly over the tees is my all-time favourite scene in a movie bar none, and the music too.....awesome. Thanks Steven for that day in the cinema in 1982 that I will never forget, and I want to repeat with the 20th anniversary showing, and make me forget and forgive you for the awful British Telecom adverts you forced poor E.T to make in the UK ( why does Steven Spielberg risk spoiling a classic movie by allowing people to cash in and make crappy adverts using E.T????) does he really need the money.

It can be childish, as some users may say, but it was essentially made for children (when I first saw it I was a kid), and, like some user said, for good-hearted people (that's a thing that can't grow old).First, I found it funny for some special moments (the first meetings between the alien and all -one by one- of the family members, when ET got drunk and caused an identical effect on Elliot, and the following scene in his classroom -kiss included-) that are simply great. Especially good was the boy who lay down to make Elliot arrive to the girl's lips, and the ride on the streets in the Halloween day, how he confused a fake ""Yoda"" with his ""home"".Moving, because of ET's ""humanity"" (when he saw Elliot's finger wounded he immediately cured it and he made a sacrifice trying to save Elliot's life),his powers (especially when he made Elliot's bicycle and later all the boys' lift and fly), his feelings (his desperation for finding himself lost in a distant planet and not finding an answer to his calls, that made him sad almost till death), and the final farewell, the final top to the movie.Original, because it shows an alien in a different point of view. Most of the ""aliens"" films before (e. g., ""Alien"") and even after (e. g. ""Independence Day"" and/or ""Mars Attacks"") show evil aliens that try to invade the Earth and/or exterminate Manhood. This alien is good, has his feelings, and a great heart inside.Like ET (the character), ET (the movie) has got a great heart. Watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Some misconceptions here,"I just want to point out that a lot of people here are pointing to the ""evil adults"" thing as a problem in this movie. This is nonsense; there are no evil or villainous adults in this movie. Sure, the scientists come off as a bit frightening, but they aren't malevolent. There are only two adults who really play roles (the detective guy and the mother), and both are ""in touch with their feelings"" and, while not always acting towards the same goals as the kids, they never act remotely evil.This is a great Film. Not a sci-fi movie, a film.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I love ET!,"ET is such an amazing movie. It shows how accepting everyone goes a long way! It all shows how attached kids become to their friends and pets. I love it so much! ET IS SO CUTE! I LOVE HIM! He bring a smile to my face. He is an amazing character and a unique one as well. When I first saw this movie, I was so scared of ET, but I watched it today...and I realized that I had nothing to be afraid of! Stephen Spielberg is a genius! This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I am going to show it to my children...cause its just that amazing!

An excellent example of film-making at its finest.,"Stepping away from the fact that I adore this film as an icon of my childhood, I feel its enduring popularity owes a debt to the capabilities of a truly creative mind. Spielberg, one in the topmost echelon of directors of the modern age, does what he does best: crafting a tale that both entertains and enlightens us. We are captivated and amused by the effects, and by the actions of the characters, but those same things also serve to teach us about ourselves and our world. Granted, a child will miss the underlying layers, but the broadest sense of the film--that everyone is deserving of, and capable of, love--is essentially impossible to miss.For those viewers that crave opportunity to see what films used to be about--entertainment AND meaning (without being overtly ""preachy"")--this is a film for you. It hails from an era when we were not drowning in big-budget extravaganzas, but instead finding a commonality in our enjoyment. This is one of the last in a legacy of films doing just that.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Adorable!!!,"I must have seen it three times now, if not more.... I JUST LOVE IT!!! I'm not going to elaborate on the gaps in the story line, I can fill them in myself. Or the significance of the symbolics, I couldn't care less. And I'm not about to question E.T.'s intelligence.... I just sit myself down and enjoy the heroic deeds of a few children, the funny (drunk) E.T. with his beautiful big blue eyes and the magic atmosphere altogether. I cry my heart out when it starts to go wrong (even after the third time)... I'm thrilled when E.T. is on his way home, knowing that he'll always be Elliot's guardian angel.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Marvelous Classic that Holds Up Well Across the Years,"Yesterday I saw ""E.T.: The Extraterrestrial"" at a theater screening for my hometown historic theater's classic film series. I was excited to see the film, because my memory of E.T. from my youth was that it was indeed a really great movie. By the same token, though, I was a bit apprehensive about watching it again as an adult. I've grown up to be a bit of a harsh critic from time to time, so I wondered whether or not I'd like the movie at all now that I'm in my thirties.I'm happy to report that I found ""E.T."" to be just as memorable and as momentous of a film now as I did when I saw it in the theater as a kid. This film is an all around classic. The story is familiar enough: a space ship crashes to earth, the lone survivor has to fend for himself in a foreign world (i.e. earth), and in doing so he meets a young boy who takes him in, shelters him, and tries to assimilate him into the family. As the film progresses E.T. learns a few words in English, at which point he is able to communicate that he wants to ""phone home"", meaning call other members of his extraterrestrial species to come get him so he can go back to the stars. The rest of the film revolves around the events that take place as E.T. goes about this task with the help of his adopted family.That having been said, the thing that really stands out about this movie is that it is a triumph for movie making and storytelling. As I have said in so many of my reviews, my philosophy on good film--and this is something that my understanding of has emerged as a result of writing these reviews here on IMDb--is that good movie making is, at its core, good storytelling. A film that can clearly, cogently, and cohesively communicate its story in a way that is entertaining tends to be a good film, period. Modern special effects are nice, and action has its place in certain films. But so often these days we see films made on the ""Transformers"" model of film making which sacrifices the clear communication of a compelling narrative in exchange for large scale CGI effects, explosions, etc.""E.T."" has none of that. It's most advanced special effects seem to have all been physically made (the space ship scene looks suspiciously like a hot air balloon at one point). E.T. himself appears to have been either a costume or a robot of some sort, not a computer generated animation (with the film having come out in 1982 this is surely the case). There is, of course, the iconic bicycling scenes that clearly were the work of some creative green screen camera work, and those scenes are neat in terms of how they are done in the film. But the point here is that despite this being a film that deals with an alien with magical powers, there are no gratuitous special effects in this movie that don't fit in well with the gist of the film or serve its plot well. The effects serve the story and contribute to the story rather than the reverse.At the end of the day, what we're left with is a grand 80's movie that is both fun and light hearted yet also poignant and emotional. This movie truly tugs at your heart strings at certain moments, and its good, creative and well designed narrative makes you care about its characters in a way that not all movies are able to replicate. As I sat watching this movie in the theater yesterday, at a certain point in the film I heard a young child boohooing over what had happened to E.T. in the last thirty minutes of the film, only to then have his tears turn to joy when E.T.'s plight resolved to the positive. I couldn't help but think that somewhere in the back of my memory that was surely my own experience when I saw this movie as a four or five year old when it was first in theaters in the early 80's. The power of this film is cross generational--and that's both fascinating and endearing.If I had anything negative to say at all about ""E.T."" it might be that in spite of its overall appeal, there is a bit of a cheesy feel to certain elements of the movie. But no sooner than I say that, I remind myself that this is a film that is made for adolescents and youth, and was a true family movie. Cheesiness is okay in this context. That said, I can see how ""E.T."" could be rightly compared to Steven Spielberg's other 80's youth classic, ""The Goonies"". Overall both films have a very similar vibe going on, even if the Goonies is a tad bit more straight forward with its comedic value.All in all, I have to give ""E.T.: The Extraterrestrial"" 10/10 stars. I toyed with the idea of a 9, but for me this film's strengths greatly surpass any relative weaknesses. It's a grand picture that provides a model of good movie making that Hollywood could learn from today.Having said all of that, as a brief aside, I'd simply advise you to now go and do an online search for ""E.T. Star Wars theory"". Mind. Blown. You're welcome.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Seamless and brilliant enhancements bring the current eyeball-reality up to par with our cherished movie memories. Well done!,"I had fond memories of having seen ""E.T."" at the theaters when it originally came out in 1982. I have never seen it since, because the VHS was late and limited, and there was no DVD until now. Anyway--- upon watching the new DVD anniversary edition, I was re-charmed and re-enrolled in the Steven Speilberg fan club (so to speak). Wow!I watched the entire restored version, waiting for the ""new effects."" i never saw them. It looked like the ""E.T."" movie I had remembered. It was bright, deep, warm, engaging, and utterly cool. It was only upon watching the marvelous commentary portions on Disk Two that I got my answers, as to where the new stuff was. Speilberg does a shot-by-shot explanation of the enhancements. Nothing ""new"" in the sense of added stuff--- by what looked great as sci-fi FX back in 1982 really DID look a bit stupid today. Not quite on the Flash Gordon level from the 1940s and 1950s, but pretty lame and stale. the enhancements added the sparkel and zong we now have come to expect from the techno advances of the California film industry. The new stuff really is seamless, and brilliant. It didn't ""change"" anything--- it merely brought the current reality up to the level of our cherished movie memories. Well done Steven!

Only one to detest this movie?,"I must stand out as the only person who detested this movie.  I found the 'in your face' sentimentality intollerable in the extreme - it was emotional manipulation of the most blatant kind.  I was irritated also by the assumption that aliens will be benign and harmless - the reality may be quite different as Independence Day shows.  I felt the  authorities were quite correct to take the precautions they did. While our record on pollution is far from brilliant, who knows what the aliens may be carrying?

An inspiring Sci-Fi Fantasy film,"If you haven't seen this film then shame on you. This film is one the reason's why Spielberg is my favourite director. He made this film for children, the film is about children and children only. if you notice in the film the children play a more dominant role than adults.

The Greatest Family Movie Ever Made,"As a young boy, I was raised around marines. They were tough as nails, typical man's man guys. But I vividly remember going to the base screening of this movie at four and entering the lobby after the movie was over and saw that every one of these marines were reduced to tears. It was in one of these moments that I saw the true power of what a truly fantastic movie can do.E.T.-The Extra Terrestrial is an emotional roller-coaster. One minute we're laughing, the next, we're afraid, the next, we're charmed, then saddened, then joyous. And all within the period of two hours. Since the film's release, the format has been copied to death, but to watch the film again, the undeniable power of the original still remains.Steven Spielberg, during his idealistic period, created this movie as a way of dealing with many emotions that family movies avoided to be more Pollyanna-ish. But this was one of the first real movies for kids that never glossed over death, coming-of-age, and divorce without being either too smiley faced or too adult. This was a movie that cared about the audience (how many movies today can say that?). Another first was this actually had kids saying lines like ""Penis breath"" and swearing. This was unheard of in 1982, now it's as common as saying Cheesy Poofs.E.T. is a good mature film for families to watch if they're ever bored of the same old PC Disney garbage that's been churned out post-Lion King. E.T. doesn't talk down to it's audience, it never insults their intelligence, it's a movie that is there to entertain and show kids what it means to be a true friend.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Always good one,"Steven Spielberg's 1982 hit about a stranded alien and his loving relationship with a fatherless boy (Henry Thomas) struck a chord with audiences everywhere, and it furthered Spielberg's reputation as a director of equally strong commercial sensibilities and classical leanings. Henry Thomas gives a strong, emotional performance as E.T.'s young friend, Robert MacNaughton and Drew Barrymore make a solid impression as his siblings, and Dee Wallace is lively as the kids' mother. The special effects almost look a bit quaint now with all the computer advancements that have occurred since, but they also have more heart behind them than a lot of what we see today.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
there aren't enough words to describe this film,"Being 21 years old, i remember this film being on every christmas when i was a youngster, so aswell as being one of my favourite films of all time, it's also one of the most nostalgic. I'm sure this is the case for many fans of this superb film. You all know the story, but to me the story is just the backbone to the movie. The real brilliance comes from Spielberg who's heart truly shines throughout. The photography and mood he creates are mesmerizing, the performances and direction of the actors could not be topped. And the ending could not be better. But i can't just praise Spielberg, because with him comes the most brilliant composer. Take a bow John Williams. The music that accompanies this movie is unforgettable, throwing in the atmosphere by the bucketload, and plus,this is the man to blame for the tears that we always find filling up our eyes at the finale, it's his music that creates the sadness and the longing for E.T and Elliot. I've seen this movie dozens of times, and i can't wait to see it on the big screen again in march.

This film is quite brilliant!,"I don't know what age you were when you first saw E.T. I was probably about 20. My older sister had gone to see it when it came out in 1982 and had really loved it and my older brother had gone to see Tron instead. I think that I was more influenced by my brother than my sister and so I by-passed it entirely. It took me ages to even give in to curiosity and watch it one Christmas, because I thought it was going to be tedious and boring and possibly even mushy. But, I did watch it and it was quite brilliant.I saw the re-release in the cinema just recently and I actually got a shiver down my spine when I was watching it. This doesn't happen to me very often - and no it was not cold in the cinema. I really was surprised that the film was as genuine and funny and complete as it was. I was surprised that the cast was actually able to act. I was very surprised that Drew Barrymore was able to be convincing. The music score was perfect. And I say that as someone who has not received much in the way of music teaching but has watched a lot of movies with some really diabolical soundtracks. E.T.'s soundtrack fits so well with every facet of what you see and it gives a real flourish that was definately absent in Tron. I don't want to talk about Mr Speilberg, but I think he did a properly good job of this one. I think what I am trying to say is, that having finally seen this film and having had a low view of it before hand, it was great to be proved wrong. This is now one of my very favourite films, and is the second best cinema experience I have ever had. If you have never bothered to watch E.T. then go and see it NOW!I should note here at the end that my brother has still never seen it, and he probably never will - I think this is something to do with honour, or was it ego.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""Spielberg's Heart and Soul""","In an age when many movie goers sit in a theater judging how real the computer generated special effects are or how detailed the computer animation is, I wonder if a movie with the heart and soul of E.T. could even find an audience.  It's disheartening when people write that movies like Shrek, Toy Story, Monsters Inc.,  are way better than this classic Stephen Spielberg film.  I enjoyed Toy Story and Shrek both, but they don't come close to the emotional impact of E.T.E.T. is not just a story about an alien who gets lost on earth.  It's a story about family, friendship, love and loneliness, and it is these elements that we always remember. Spielberg, drawing on his own childhood experiences, captivates us with an unforgettable and timeless story.  E. T. could be every lonely child's invisible friend.  We never think of E.T. as an alien special effect, but as Elliot's own invisible friend come to life. We see the pain of a family going through divorce without being hammered over the head with it in every scene, a masterful achievement in itself.  Of all of Spielberg's great films, I can't think any can match what he achieved in E.T, scene for scene.  Melissa Mathison's script is perfect, the casting was as if Spielberg rubbed a magic lamp, asked for the perfect cast, and got it.  John Williams score is so beautifully done, it is worth listening to just by itself.There is not a wasted moment in this film, every scene is exceptional and memorable.  I saw this movie on it's original release in 1982.  At the end of the movie, the audience stood and applauded, something I have not seen again in twenty years.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Pure Torment,"This is one of the worst films I've ever forced myself to sit through. I'm astounded that audiences are taken in by its paper-thin veneer of manufactured warmth and cuddliness, and blinded to its gaping flaws as drama. ET is to beloved childhood films (say, The Yearling, or Sammy Going South, or The Thief of Bagdad, or any of Disney's best works) what the Twinky is to homemade apple strudel.I'll leave aside the obvious contrivances of the concept, and the utter lack of likability of the rubberized title character. Instead, I'll note the main element that made me detest this film: the manipulative illogic of the central premise. We are expected to see the parents as the villains, even though they're clearly not. We are expected to cheer the brave, resourceful kids who actually accomplish nothing other than a needless escape from people who are clearly trying to help them.There's no other semblance of tension here, so if that collapses - and it does, in a great putrid, oozing ball of schmaltz - there's precious little left. Spielberg is a brilliant technician, and he's made a few truly outstanding films. But ET is Spielberg at his soppy, sentimental, nauseating worst.

Exceeded It's Limit,"ET was one movie I grew up watching and enjoying. I loved the characters, music and famous scenes that brought it back to cinema about ten years after.

The effects of the extra-terrestrial were just average, the character ET looked quite fake at times, but what can I expect it was created in 1982, there was no CGI or high powered effects. The movie exceeded it's limit and should of finished thirty minutes after, too much slow paced dialog and impatient waiting to see what's going to happen next. Apart from that, it's still just a good movie, the acting is okay, characters (apart from ET) are again okay, overall a nice family movie but with it's exceeding parts that slows the movie down is a high negative.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Greatest Sci-fi/Family Movie Of All Time!,"I don't think this is the best sci-fi movie in general. Check out the Star Wars flicks, for instance. Get a little more picky with the genre ET is, and it becomes the best. I have lost count with how many times I have seen this movie, but I don't care. It never gets old for me.In 1977, Spielberg created the sci-fi masterpiece ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" which perfectly balanced aliens and reality. Unfortunately, 1977 was also the year of what many believe to be the best sci-fi flick and the biggest movie at the time: ""Star Wars: A New Hope."" As majestic as Close Encounters was, Star Wars was easily the better film...by a long shot. Five years later, Spielberg tops Close Encounters with what was sure to be his best movie: ""E.T. The Extra Terrestrial."" Guaranteed a Best Picture or Best Director win, Spielberg loses both to Richard Attenborough's ""Gandhi."" Attenborough always felt that ET was the superior movie, and many people these days think so, as Gandhi has not been able to stand the test of time. As A David Lean-esque film, Attenborough directs a marvellous film, but as a ""narrative picture"" there's very few layers that make some scenes dry and boring and the overall product dragged out. ""Without the character of Gandhi, the movie is nothing."" ET is original, fun, shorter and touching. It follows the story of ten-year-old, Elliot (Thomas) who's parents are divorced, is non-comparable with his siblings (Barrymore, McNaughtan) and friendless. That is until a lost alien arrives and rebuilds him, and helps the alien. ET is not a kiddie or immature film. Everybody can see this and feel emotionally connected with is, as it is about feeling lonesome and how friendship can heel someone. Spielberg wrote the screenplay inspired by some of his own events, his parents got divorced and he felt alone in the world.

I suppose there are some scenes of genuine Spielberg-ian wonderment on the screen but for most of the movie E.T. just creeps around the house making a mess in the kitchen and making strange noises. I guess I'm supposed to chuckle or go ""Awwwww"" at those scenes. Instead I glance at my watch. Overrated.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
He should have stayed at home.,"In ""The Silence of the Lambs"" Hannibal Lechter memorably said ""you must ask of each thing-what is it,in itself?"". Applying this to E.T., the plot is is basically that someone gets left behind by his friends and has to contact them to come back for him.Doesn""t sound very promising,does it? Well it isn""t,and E.T. like ""Star Wars"" is one of those movies which masquerade as Science Fiction whist playing to an audience who would run away from the real thing. Stephen Spielberg,who appears to have [literally] ""lost the plot"" after CE3K,  once admitted that E.T. was based on the Martian in ""The War Of The Worlds""[1953] and if you watch that classic movie you""ll find that the only real alteration he made was to give E.T. a huge pair of blue eyes to appeal to the kiddie audience the movie was aimed at! Everything else in the movie was sugar coated frippery to appeal to the mass audience and barely deserves a mention. Two thoughts occur to me though; why didn""t E.T.s fellow aliens realise he was missing and return for him? and since nobody destroyed his ""telephone"" why didn""t the authorities use it to contact the aliens? Like many people the hype surrounding this movie suckered me into seeing it in 1983 and i remember staggering out into Leicester Square thinking ""i could have bought 3 pints instead of seeing that""!   4/10.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A classic!,"It was four years ago my family and I watched the 20th anniversary edition of the DVD. My father actually had fond memories of this movie when it came out (in his single adult years), mainly because of this famous line ' ET Phone Home'. After I saw it on DVD, I realised why my father said that.It's really touching and moving. The alien (ET) is also quite cute, maybe given the overall appearance is not what one can consider cute actually. And I can never imagine that I will see a young Drew Barrymore (given I often heard this movie is one of her earliest participation) on the screen.It's really amazing and heart-warming, especially when Elliot is very attached to ET though the latter has to be send back to where it belongs. It almost broke my heart as I watched. I almost cried. Yes.It first came out five years before I was born (okay, indirectly saying how old I am now...LOL) but then in its 20th anniversary edition, I guessed I knew why director Steven Spielberg is considered among the best in the business.

A timeless classic....,"I've read the reviews of this movie and I was shocked. I thought everyone loved this movie as much as I do. I was 9 when it was first released, and I saved Birthday money and conned every family member I could to take me to see it as many times as I could. This movie, although almost 20 years old, still holds water against all the COMPUTER generated special effects of today. There are parts of the movie so detailed you can see E.T.'s veins and temples pulse. Although Drew Barrymore's cheesy performance makes my stomach turn, I can over look that. This movie, torn apart for it's ""unbelievability"" (which is the most MINDLESS argument against a FICTIONAL movie I can imagine) is a heart warming story of a boy who's lost and alone looking for a friend. Here's an alien also left alone. Elliot's parents are separated--a point made more than once in the movie. This can have an effect on any 10 year old, then and now, and he's also the ""middle"" child. Here he finds E.T. and is able to love, and be loved, without question. I paid to see it 10 times when I was a kid. I went to see it in the theaters AGAIN on it's re-release in 1985-ish (?). I own the original copy released on video, and then bought it AGAIN when it was re-released on video with interviews from Stephen and cast. I own over 300 movies and none of them have received that kind of love and attention from me. Parents can watch this with their kids, or.... without them.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

However, on Halloween, something sad happens to them...The reason I love this movie is because of the uniqueness.

E.T. Is A Magical Experience That Appeals Equally To Viewers Of All Ages.,"With innocence at its heart & sheer magic on its surface, E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial is one of the most adored & beloved films of all time which with its emotionally stirring narration, stunning portrait of childhood & exquisite depiction of the beauty of friendship ends up being a truly magical & spellbinding experience that still appeals to viewers of all ages.It tells the story of an alien left behind on the planet by its peers when they take off in a hurry due to human interference. All alone on Earth by himself, E.T. eventually finds shelter in Elliot's home in whom he also finds an emotional companion & friend. What follows next is E.T.'s more acquaintance with Elliot's siblings, his adventures in the house & his deep desire to return home while he is being hunted by intelligence officials.Steven Spielberg's direction here weaves the plot with remarkable balance as he effortlessly succeeds in providing great emotional depth to all characters, including E.T., while also portraying childhood & its simplicity in a very charming manner. Cinematography captures the world from a child's point of view. Editing is elegantly carried out. And the visual effects are state-of-the-art stuff just like they are in every film by Spielberg.The performances by the cast is as innocent as childhood itself & shows great bonding all around. From child actors like Henry Thomas & Drew Barrymore to Dee Wallace & others, everyone does an impressive job in their given roles & their emotional performances are highly convincing. Even E.T. managed to express itself pretty well and is destined to make viewers smile, laugh & cry with him.Also, a special mention about the exceptional score by John Williams. The soundtrack presents the most perfect collaboration between Spielberg & Williams so far that in my opinion is Williams' finest composition. The contribution its score single-handedly made to this film is huge & an achievement in itself as it took the emotions of this film to a whole new level and is at its very best during the final moments.Featuring brilliant direction, mesmerizing narration, classic editing, innocent performances, lovely cinematography & great visuals, E.T. is magic in movie-making that presents Spielberg at his absolute best and succeeds not only as one of the most exciting sci-fi adventures of its or any other time but also as one of the greatest films ever made.On an overall scale, Covering themes of abandonment, childhood, innocence, friendship, loss & separation, E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial is a very adventurous, hilarious & heartwarming film that will leave you with a sense of immense joy, nostalgia & smile as well as tears in the end.

Still the jewel in Spielberg's Crown,"I was fortunate to see the sneak preview tonight of the 20th anniversary edition of this film and it still remains the brightest jewel in Steven Spielberg's crown.  Over the years we have been blessed to bear witness to one masterpiece after another, but this one stands out above all others. Mr. Spielberg has certainly made more mature, better looking films, but there is nothing that can replace the touching moments found between Elliot and E.T.  Going into tonight, I accused the director of committing a gross case of historical revision by attempting to make the film more politically correct, but I will admit that I am wrong.  The changes he has made went virtually undetected and the digital enhancement blends in flawlessly (with the exception of one occasion).I have been reminded of what a treasure this film really is and seeing it with a theatre of children reminded me how I felt when the film came out in 1982.

The re-mastered score was very well done. The new features put on E.T give it the look that was meant to be but could not be accomplished 20 years ago. I really enjoyed the movie all over again.

Spielberg's Greatest Love Story,"This was one of the first films I saw at the cinema, all the way back in 1982. I only really appreciated it's wonder and magic several years later. This is not just a science fiction tale it is a beautiful love story between a young boy and his almost imaginary friend.I think the wonder of this film is based around the strong performances by the leads. It has always amazed me that Henry Thomas and the underrated Robert MacNaughton have never made more success of their obvious talent.But this is Spielberg bombarding his audience with emotion. My mum tells me I cried as a 5 year old in the cinema, there is a lump in my throat still now as a 24 year old, though this is due to exhilaration as much as emotion.A great film for everyone a must for Spielberg fans even though there cant be many who havent seen it.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A touching film for kids and adults,"Few films have ever entertained me, exited me and brought me so close to tears as E.T. It has humor and thrills and a whole lot of heart.

I have loved this movie since childhood and will love it for the rest my life. Like all great movies for kids, E.T. appeals to people both young and old. The performances are so convincing and the emotions are so real that you can't help being caught up in the thrilling adventure of a boy and his friend from outer space. This movie is Steven Spielberg's masterpiece. Schindler's List was excellent, but most of it's power came from the scenes of innocent Jews being randomly shot. It's main emotinons are that of fear and sorrow, but E.T. focuses on love and that is the most powerful and most important feeling of them all. If you haven't seen it and you're thinking that this film is cheesy or sappy, it's not. It's very real and very entertaining. It's the perfect film for anyone who has ever felt lonely or rejected and wished that they had a friend.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Steven Spielberg and the Quest for the Might Dollar,"When I was 7, I loved E.T. and thought it was brilliant.  As time passed, I couldn't help but see all of Spielberg's little inclusions that make this not only typical, but outstandingly mediocre.  Spielberg loves making his ideal worlds the same as John Hughes, complete with similar endings.  This defines the 80s...First off we have the white, middle-class, suburban family.  Briefly touched on in Jaws, this idea only grew with Close Encounters, 1941, and Poltergeist.  He even includes it as a subtle trait in Minority Report.  If Steven is trying to invoke fear or wonder that ""this could happen to you"", he profoundly fails.  Diversity is obviously not one of his strong suits. Cameron sticks to professionals (whether soldiers, workers, colonists, but never sees them as people) and Tarantino has gangsters, therein lies the common trait of directing.The character of E.T. in itself is too innocent.  I would love to have seen what Cronenberg would have done with this story.  We get the typical Spielberg ""happy"" and ""sad"" moments (B-O-O-H-O-O, cry me a river) full of phony emotion that other directors have tried copying ever since.  While this is a delight for the intellectually devoid in film, I gag at it.Worse yet, we now have the ""safer"" special edition loaded with a few extra seconds and altered footage (I thought Michael Moore was the only one who did that) that adds NOTHING to the story.  I am sick of it...Overall, you don't need to see this movie to understand Spielberg.  To think that Das Boot defeated it for the technical awards is a complete abomination on the Academy of Fools' part.  1 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The wonderful product of a long evolution,"By 1982, Spielberg had already mastered several genres: Terror (Jaws); Science Fiction (Close Encounters of the Third Kind) and, remarkably, adventures with Raiders of the Lost Ark, the first modern adventures film. He put all those together with his ability to understand and manipulate the public's feelings and created E.T. that is a lot of a drama and a bit of all the previously mentioned movies.This long evolution, together with the excellent work of John Williams was enough to create one of the best films of the decade, and perhaps the Spielberg's master piece. It is sensitive, sweet and emotive, while thrilling and cheerful sometimes. It distills the true essence of Hollywood. Not surprisingly, it shocked the whole world at its release and its influence was tremendous. Like it or not, the picture of the flying bicycles has became an all-time classic and will be associated forever with he cinema in the eighties, and not just the kids will remember the words ""be good"".",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Spielberg, one of the greatest directors of all time took a big risk in a making a family movie about a boy and an alien. If this movie were made today, it would most likely flop because no one would think it would look interesting. Spielberg knows how to make a movie. He put all the great elements in a great movie: Drama, comedy, tearjerkering.

amazing,This movie changed the business of film making forever.  I find it amazing that it is ranked so low by imdb's users.  I believe that on its historic impact on the business alone it should be in the top twenty.  The only reason I can see it being this low is because Speilberg has kept such a tight reign on the availability of it.  It is the least exploited film of all time.

This movie is one of the most iconic family/science fiction films in all of cinema. How does it hold up today?,"""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"" (1982), I remember when I first saw this movie as a child. To this day, I'm still blown away with how great this film is. It's definitely one of my top 10 all-time favorite family/science fiction films. It has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and of course a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The story is, an alien named E.T. winds up here on Earth and needs to find his way home. Now, that sounds like a basic everyday movie plot. But, the way it's written and expressed is so exciting, clever and heartwarming all at the same time. That's a rare combination for a movie! It has an impeccable balance of science fiction, action and comedy with a hint of drama. The whole movie from beginning to end is cinematic perfection. But, make sure that you have tissues with you, especially if you're seeing it for the first time. You'll cry tears of joy at different moments throughout the film! All of the acting is superb from all of the actors and actresses. They put on stellar performances unique to their characters which makes them all shine as individuals. The chemistry between the full cast of characters is one of the best you'll see in any family movie! Their performances really make you care for the characters, which is what truly defines flawless performances. Every one of the sets/locations are phenomenal and give this movie an excellent atmosphere. My personal favorite set/location is the bike scene between E.T. and Elliot. That shot of them flying on the bike together in front of the moon certainly deserves to be on the list of the top 10 most iconic shots in all of cinematic history. No wonder Steven Spielberg used it for his Amblin Entertainment logo! All of the special effects are perfect, and still hold up to this day. Finally, the soundtrack composed by John Williams is one of the best he has ever written. John Williams is my all-time favorite music writer and composer in cinema and this film score is no exception. If you see a movie where the music is written by John Williams, then you know you have the best music for your film! ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"" is cinematic gold. It's truly a timeless movie to wash away your stress and win your heart. I can watch it over and over again and never get tired of it. Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen this movie yet, go watch it right now, especially if you have children. I guarantee that you won't be disappointed and your kids will love this film as well. You need this movie in your life. Hurry up, E.T.'s ship is leaving!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""I'll be right here""","One of the big secrets to the blockbuster format of the late 70s and early 80s was that while the movies were primarily aimed at an adult audience, for the most part they were also fine to take your kids along to. It was only a small twist then for that most savvy of blockbuster pioneers Steven Spielberg to create a picture that was made for kids but could also appeal to the grown-ups in the audience. But most of all, like the director's earlier hits, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial works because it is just so well thought out and perfectly pulled off.The opening moments of E.T. are a masterful piece of filmmaking. Spielberg shows us what the aliens are doing without revealing quite what they look like. We see a few silhouettes through the trees, a couple close-ups of hands and feet, even some point-of-view shots, but no clear views. This builds up a feeling of wonder and anticipation. We only get to see exactly what E.T. is like when Elliot encounters him face-to-face, which helps us identify with Elliot's discovery of his new friend. Bizarrely, in the CGI-ed up 2002 re-release Spielberg violates his own earlier genius by including a very clear shot in the opening scene of E.T. running into a clearing as his spaceship departs. This, to my mind, is far worse than the oft-maligned change of cops' guns into walkie-talkies, because it would destroy that sense of curiosity for a first time viewer. Spielberg claimed the re-release is how he would have done it first time round had he had the technology, but I reckon he's mistaken. It seems in his drive to make the creature more realistic he forgot the careful touches that made the picture so vital in the first place.Thankfully, even in the overdone re-release there is enough of the director's original inventiveness shining through. A move like cutting down the line on the ringing telephone seems a bit excessive, until you later see an identical bit of cutting on E.T.'s makeshift equivalent, encouraging us to draw a parallel between the two machines. Spielberg keeps the focus on the younger characters by having some of the less important adult figures (such as the teacher or some of the government scientists) appear only vaguely – hands, backs, but never faces. In contrast, the focus is constantly on the facial expressions of the three children and E.T. A really important moment is the reaction shot of E.T. as he watches Elliot and Michael making threats over Gertie's favourite toy. At that point, the little alien stops being an odd creature and becomes a feeling, empathising character.And then there is so much else to this picture that make it so wonderful. There is its touching story, one of the most heart-warming aspects of which is the way E.T.'s presence brings the family together. There is John Williams' powerful and evocative score that seems so utterly in tune with every image. And the performances of the three young actors, natural and deeply poignant, and even out-acting their on screen mother Dee Wallace. A moment like the release of the frogs and the recreation of a scene from The Quiet Man, inter-cut with the original may be incredibly surreal for a kids picture, but it is a gorgeous tribute to all that is romantic in cinema. The ironic thing is that E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is such an intelligent and beautiful production, it moves me more as an adult that it did as a child.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

What a beautiful movie!,"Hi, I'm studying in EF language school. Actually, I'm from Korea and in USA now. I watched this movie, ET, in my class. Then my teacher recommend to me writing down my review on this site. When I saw the movie, I thought that ET could speak was so funny. Such as ""ET phone home~"". However, FBI in the child's house is awkward. I think, because it's too old movie maybe. My favorite scene is at the moment when ET and child fly in full moon with bicycle. It's so beautiful and famous scene. Eliot, hero in the movie and his friends were really good at riding a bicycle! I saw that when they ran away from FBI. And they flew in the sky because of ET's magic. I want to do that, too. Lastly,emotional factors were very impressive. When Eliot and ET said good bye, I was so sad T.TAnyway, I don't know if my short review is good or bad. I just wanted to try to write my opinion on American Internet site.

It has lovable characters and you can't help falling in love with this film.E.T: The Extra-Terrestrial follows the story of an alien who is accidentally abandoned on earth who befriends an earth boy. It shows their relationship over a short period of time and how close they become after various, heart-warming events.The whole cast is outstanding, especially Henry Thomas (Elliot) and Drew Barrymore (Gurtie) and E.T is brilliant.The film is wonderful for people of every generation and is guaranteed to make every person who watches it reach for the tissues.

My thoughts..,"I think that this movie is very good for people of all ages. It is a very kind and old movie. We can see how deep and strong a friendship even between person and alien really is. I think that the old part is much better, than a new one. I really liked the part with Halloween. By the way E.T. is a very sweet creature. Also I was very scared when everybody thought that E.T. died. Steven Spielberg is great movie director. He is very talented. I love to watch his movies. What I can also tell, that in Russia it's not really common to make movies like that, but it's a very good idea. While reading reviews of people from different countries, I can admire that people all over the world love this movie. It was made about 27 years ago, but still is one of the greatest. The thing is, I am very disappointed that I couldn't catch this movie in the movie theater. I think I would like to have a friend like E.T. when I was 11.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

interesting and moving,"The reason why I chose this film to watch is that this is very famous one in the world. Actually my mother recommends me to watch, so I picked this up. The story is about alien coming to the earth and living with people. At the beginning, a boy met the alien called ET, then they come to live together at his house with his brother, sister and mother. The boy named Eliot can understand ET's feelings. Through the days when they live together, they become good friends and have strong tie. In the end, what happens to ET? I completely like this film, because I enjoyed some different feelings like happy and sad. Also I laughed at ET, because he is cute enough to talk like human. Of course children can enjoy, but I think their parents also can enjoy this too. I really thought ET is very pretty.

"After twenty years, E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial is still one of the greatest movies ever made.","Great children's movies are few and far between, but finding a movie to be embraced as passionately by adults is even a rarer find. Steven Spielberg's artistic brilliance is more apparent than ever, finding the most wonderful nuances and marvelous visual imagery in every situation. The scene where E.T. stays home and Elliott is at school has greater poetic enchantment looking at it now than it did back then. Elliott starts to absorb E.T.'s feelings and imitates his physiological reactions. When E.T. gets drunk at home, Elliott gets drunk at school. Like something out of a beautiful romance film, E.T. watches a movie at home where he sees a big, romantic kiss in a 40's movie is on television. At school a tumbling wave of wind practically sweeps Elliott off his feet as he shares his first kiss with a pretty girl (Erika Eleniak). There are other eerie and oddly wonderful moments, like Elliott's first encounter with what he thinks is a goblin. When Elliott is able to lure E.T. into the house, they become friends. Elliott builds a rapport with E.T. by showing him his toys that he demonstrates is like his own tribunal council. At Halloween, E.T. thinks that a kid dressed up like Yoda is some kind of messenger from beyond the stars. When authorities finally locate E.T., they wrap the house up in contamination-protective plastic and bring in men in NASA suits in such freaky abrupt nonchalance that it feels like the worse fascist government invasion. Additional scenes for this twentieth anniversary include a scene where E.T. takes a bath and a scene at Halloween where the other kids (Robert McNaughton and Drew Barrymore) are trick-or-treating and the neighborhood is wild with teepee-making and other acts of anarchy. These scenes don't serve as a distraction like other inexplicable director's cuts, but are actually well-integrated additions. The visual effects are also enhanced and the film is also enjoying a re-mastered soundtrack. When E.T. was released 1982, the movie raked in more money than any film in history and was garnered with nine Academy Award nominations. The movie lost to Gandhi at the Academy Awards, which now looks like a crude footnote. Richard Attenborough's stuffy Oscar-winning biography of the Mahatma was a three-hour bore that never gave face to the human atrocities of the great British rule over India and chose long, long talk over putting visuals to action. Basically, it sanitized the story of Gandhi and the movie henceforth is a big, laborious textbook that couldn't even make simple timelines of its subject. E.T. was one of the greatest movies ever made, but how important was it? Looking at it today, the story of a young boy whose parents have recently separated, and is desperately lonely and looking for a friend  no matter where a friend may come from  is more poignant than ever. Additionally, thinking the film would flop, M & M's asked the producers of E.T. to remove their product from the movie.  Reese's Pieces were then used, culminating in one of the film's greatest sequences. The magic of E.T. soars off the screen and the heart rejoices in that last great chapter. Elliott orchestrates an escape with E.T. away from the authorities and when those bicycles take off the ground, there isn't a greater voyage one could ever imagine. John Williams' music is the most magnificent score he ever created for any film. Spielberg's ending is maybe the finest moment of",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Beautiful!,"Earlier this evening, I ventured to the Cinema with the intentions of seeing the twentieth anniversary re-release of E.T.  Although I had seen the film several times throughout my childhood on video (though never in theaters due to the fact that I was born five months after its initial release), went on the ""E.T. Adventure"" ride in Universal Studios, and even watched it a few years ago on cable, I was not prepared for what I was about to experience.E.T. is a masterpiece.  Few films even come close to being this beautiful without bordering on corniness.  However, I can hardly put into words what Steven Spielberg has accomplished.   I cannot think of a  more touching movie, or even one that can come close (I'm not saying that it's impossible, I'm just saying that no other films of this caliber come to mind).The characters are real, including E.T., and the dialogue is real. Unlike so many other films or sitcoms which feature children, the children of E.T. speak and react like all kids do when they are that age.  This gives it universal appeal.  Kids like it because it is about kids, and adult viewers like it because they can relate to it, unlike the bulls*** child characters of the brady bunch and full house who speak almost entirely in catchphrases and never have any real emotions or friends.Like Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo, and Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands this film is regarded as Spielberg's most personal project.  And also like these films, it is probably his best, which, in Spielberg's case (I know it's kind of a cliché, but still), is really saying something.  His genius is prevalent throughout it, and would be crap in the hands of probably any other director.I didn't much like the added special effects for the twentieth anniversary special edition, but I didn't feel that they cheapened the film, like in the special edition of Return Of The Jedi.  I think that the special edition is just as beautiful as the original version of the film, and that those who see it for the first time will love it just as much, but they were unnecessary, and the film did look better without them.  For example, the suspense is completely removed from, although it is probably the most famous scene in the movie and was not a surprise to people seeing it for the first time,  when E.T. saves Elliot and himself by making the bicycle fly above the ditch.  This scene in the original edition had much more suspense in it and made the audience believe, even if only for a split second, that something horrible was going to happen to E.T. and Elliot.  However, the suspense is completely removed from the special edition where they essentially just fly off the cliff, and noone in the audience is scared at all.  Maybe its just me, but I liked that scene better without the added effects.But, the real beauty in E.T. stems from its view of love and friendship. The love shown in this film is that of friendship, and, to me at least, it is more believable, and more beautiful than any other kind of love shown in any other film, including those considered to be ""Love Stories"" and ""Romances"".  However, if I knew anything about romance at all, then I probably wouldn't be writing seven paragraph articles about movies for fun at one o'clock in the morning, so I might not be the best source of information in that department.In conclusion, I personally know people, though not many, who have never seen any of the Star Wars movies before.  Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that there are still a few people left who have yet to see E.T.  To them, I say see it.  Regardless of who you are, how old you are, and where you're from, you will enjoy it.  It is quite possibly the most universally relevant, beautiful films that has ever been made, and should be seen by everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The Epic Masterpiece that put Spielberg on the top of the world,"About 23 years ago, Steven Spielberg made a film inspired by his lonely childhood life particularly his parents' divorce and came release day, without question became the ultimate king of the box office hit film of the year 1982. It was called ""E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial"" and it was a story that forever touched the world.The Sci-Fi Drama which told the heartwarming story about friendship, loyalty, devotion and most of all love. When a spaceship lands, one of the visitors is left behind. Then he finds shelter in a young boy's tool shed of his home. They're first encounter is rather scary for the both of them. But once they meet again, they begin to get along with each other. The young boy named Elliott (potrayed by a young Henry Thomas)decides to take in the harmless loving creature into his home, but when he does he discovers that he and E.T. have far more in common than either one of them ever thought. Elliott later recruits his older brother Michael (Robert MacNaughton) and younger sister Gertie (Drew Barrymore) for help to find out where E.T. is from and what they can do get him back home safe and sound. But there's only one problem: the government is after him and the kids will do anything to protect the alien with their lives. At one point, E.T.'s life shatters and falls into complete illness along with Elliott's as well. E.T. dies which leaves the boy in complete sadness, but it's Gertie who's absolutely shocked to see this happen to a very special friend she loves so much, even she much like her brother would never let him die. Filled with tears the last thing we all could want is to wish for him to return. And it's fulfilled when he surprisingly resurrects to life! Now Elliott, along with Michael and co. must transport him to the forest of E.T.'s rendezvous point dodging government and local authorities. Mission Accomplished. Once the spaceship arrives, E.T.'s adventure on Earth is finally over. Although he must leave to live on, but it means saying farewell to those who nourished him and fought for him. Gertie gives the creature a pot full of flowers and a passionate kiss on his face(on of my favorite scenes in the film). He later thanks Michael for everything and gives a heartwarming hug to the one who loved him like a brother: Elliott. He later boarded the ship, it took off and left a signature of peace between man and alien: A RAINBOW!!In the end this turned out to be a film almost everyone can learn about true friendship and love. I can relate to Elliott because I was living the exact same way he was, but I can also connect with E.T. himself. Because he was the kind of friend who is so special, there's no other friend you can think of otherwise. In my mind, this is one of the greatest achievements from Master Spielberg and the most popular American classic film of all time that is to forever be treasured and loved as well as appreciated at the same time. I don't care if it's kiddie or dull BECAUSE IT'S NOT!! (for all you dumb shits who didn't like the movie), it's the classic that forever changed the face of American cinematic history and broke box office records from all over the world. everyone else can say what they want, believe what they want. But it will not change anything, nor my viewing of the film because I can watch it so many times and never get tired of it, NEVER!! The truth is that this is an epic masterpiece and deserves better as it should have more than 20 years ago, so for Spielberg, you are the man!!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The protagonist, in a threatening atmosphere suggesting Herod's massacre of the innocents, is discovered in a garage (modern equivalent of a stable), suffers the little children to come unto him, performs a healing miracle, is ""crucified"" by its captors, and after rising again. ascends to heaven, presumably to sit at the right hand of the Giant Head.  But the nice part is that, unlike the original, embarrassing tale, this version makes absolutely no demands; one is not required to change one's cushy and acquisitive life, to sell one's worldly stuffed toys or love one's enemies or turn the other cheek; in Spielberg's soggy vision, all you need is sentimentality, and the suburbs go on as before.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A Timeless Tale of Friendship and Wonder,"E. T. The Extra-Terrestrial is a 1982 science fiction film directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Melissa Mathison. It tells the story of Elliott, a lonely 10-year-old boy who befriends an alien creature, dubbed E. T., who is stranded on Earth. Together, they embark on a journey to help E. T. return to his home planet, while evading the government agents who are after him.The film is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential films of all time, as well as a masterpiece of family entertainment. It has been praised for its touching and heartfelt portrayal of childhood, its imaginative and thrilling adventure, its superb visual effects and music, and its universal themes of friendship, love, and wonder.One of the film's most remarkable aspects is its use of point of view. The film is mostly seen through the eyes of either Elliott or E. T., creating a strong emotional bond between the audience and the characters. We experience their curiosity, fear, joy, and sadness as they discover each other and the world around them. Spielberg also employs a low-angle camera to emphasize the perspective of the children and the alien, and to contrast them with the menacing and faceless adults who threaten their friendship.Another key element of the film is its music, composed by John Williams. The score is rich and expressive, capturing the mood and tone of each scene. The main theme, which plays during the iconic flying bicycle sequence, is one of the most memorable and recognizable pieces of film music ever written. It conveys a sense of wonder, magic, and exhilaration, as well as a longing for home. The music also enhances the emotional impact of the film, especially in the climactic farewell scene, where Williams' music and Spielberg's visuals create a powerful and moving cinematic moment.E. T. The Extra-Terrestrial is a film that transcends its genre and appeals to audiences of all ages and backgrounds. It is a film that celebrates the innocence, hope, and good cheer of childhood, as well as the power of imagination and creativity. It is a film that explores the meaning of friendship and love, and the importance of finding one's place in the universe. It is a film that inspires awe and wonder, and reminds us of the magic and beauty of life.

Spielberg made the actors in the film believe that E.T. Was real despite them knowing he was fake, and in doing so, he made all of us believe that he was real as well. This film is also paced perfectly, while giving you the perfect amount of excitement, curiosity, suspense, and laughter. It is a disgrace that this film is not in the top 50, not to mention, top 250. In all honesty, I am not even being bias, the criticism I have heard for this film has been utter and complete garbage. Hearing people complaining because ""E.T. Is an ugly pedophile, and that this film is a little kids movie."" These people honestly know nothing about film. E.T. Might very well be one of the most under-appreciated films that many people love! E.T. Is the most perfect film I have ever seen, and is the film that is most deserving....of a 10/10!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Superb,"I love this movie and John Williams's score is absolutely memorable and gives it extra dimension. Such an antidote to Jaws for sure. I wish there was a sequel but so far not to be.

The Film Is Nothing But Magic!,"1982's E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial is a movie for the ages and an instant classic. Watching this movie again gave me the feels of nostalgia. This film was an important part of my childhood and now as an adult, this movie is still nothing but exceptional filmmaking. This is a movie that is perfect for the entire family and it is a story that both adults and children can relate to. The central theme is about a lonely child finding a new friend. By the time the credits roll on your screen, there will not be a dry eye in the house. This is the kind of enchanting and magical film we have here.E.T was directed by the great Steven Spielberg whom we know as the director of famed films like Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Raiders of the Lost Ark. He ventured into more family-friendly territory with this movie. He made the movie a parallel to his own childhood. As a child in 1960, Spielberg's parents divorced thus leaving him quite lonely as well as a tormentor turned protector toward his younger siblings-things that we see clearly in the characters portrayed on screen. Spielberg and screenwriter Melissa Mathison were able to take these childhood elements and effectively show how painful/wonderful growing up can be.The movie begins with a bunch of alien botanists on Earth, but they rush to leave when discovered by a human task force. Unfortunately, one little alien is left behind. The alien is now left alone to fend for himself on a very strange planet. He soon meets 10-year-old Elliot (Henry Thomas), whose parents just separated. They soon become friends. E.T dearly misses his home and tries to send a message to his folks back home while becoming acquaintances with Elliot's mother, Mary (Dee Wallace), brother Michael (Robert MacNaughton), and sister Gertie (Drew Barrymore). Soon, E.T becomes seriously ill.....and so does Elliot thanks to their special bond. When the task force finally intrudes, it may be hard for E.T to join his people again.I remember when first seeing the movie, I was not impressed with Henry Thomas's performance. Now years later, I come to appreciate his performance. As far as child actors go, Thomas is one of the better ones. Speaking of child actors, Barrymore is very adorable here. She became a big movie star, but this is the role I know her by. If E.T was played by a human, I would say this performance was excellent. The alien was voiced by Pat Welsh, who apparently smoked two packs of cigarettes a day, thus creating the perfect voice for E.T.I loved the look of E.T. The little alien looks perfectly grotesque but he also looks very cuddly. His eyes are a standout and I like the way he can raise his neck. The way the alien uses sound is also memorable. The catlike purring, those child-like squeals of surprise, etc. Speaking of the looks, the visuals of the film are fantastic! The one scene that stays with me in the bicycle chase/flying scene. Set to the sweeping, magical music of John Williams, you feel the magic as we watch E.T help the children avoid the cops chasing after them.E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial is the reason why we go to the movies. To escape from our realities and join a world that is filled with magic and emotion. Steven Spielberg created a narrative achievement unlike ever seen before. A family film designed to make you feel, think, and get lost in this world. Every time I finish the movie, there are tears running down my face. Sorry Gandhi, but this film should have won Best Picture at the Academy Awards. Solid performances, great visuals, an alien you will never forget, one of John Williams's best scores are just few of the many great things this movie has to offer. Also fun fact! Reeses Pieces became my favorite candy thanks to this movie! Thank you, Elliot for leaving trail of this delicious candy to use as bait for our favorite alien!My Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the greatest all-time classics,"This is a must see movie for everyone around the world. What Steven Spielberg does here for kids (and grown-ups) is just amazing.

Cinematic Perfection,"There are few popular movies that the majority would consider to be the peak of cinema, and even fewer of those that I would agree with. E. T., however, is as its star, Dee Wallace, once said: ""This is our generation's Wizard of Oz.""
E. T. is a rather simple story on the onset: an alien from a foreign planet touches down on Earth, misses his chance to get back home, gets found by a young boy whose entire life is irreversibly changed by taking in the little alien and helping him find his way home.Every single emotion in this entire film is nothing short of purely authentic. Dee Wallace, although earlier on in her spirituality work, managed to channel some of the most intensely beautiful and poignant emotion into this film, exiting the film just as the audience finds themselves with tears streaming down their face.This is movie perfection. This is movie magic. This is a movie that, much like The Wizard of Oz, our society will still cherish ten generations from now on formats and devices we couldn't even dream of existing in the modern age. This is a truly special work, and it will forever be remembered for its unparallelled perfection.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
My favorite alien movie!,"While we have classic movies with aliens like ""Predator,"" ""Alien,"" ""War of the Worlds,"" ""My Favorite Martian,"" ""Mars Attacks!,"" and ""Independence Day,"" one movie stands out as one of the best ever made: ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial."" This is certainly one of Steven Spielberg's best films ever. He did such a good job bringing the relationship between Elliot and E.T. not only to life, but to our hearts.I was also emotionally devastated when it was all over because of the various scene toward the end. You'll never have another movie like this. I believe that Spielberg should have won the Oscar for Best Director. It's a shame that he didn't. But, he still won one regardless.All in all, this is a movie for all ages. See it. You'll love it.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
E.T. Phones Home A Billion-Dollar Movie,"Nearly twenty years since it was first released on the world, Steven Spielberg's 1982 sci-fi/fantasy masterpiece E.T.: THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL remains one of the greatest movies ever made.  This is one of those films that makes us feel and think at the same time.Its story of a very benign alien being accidentally left stranded on Earth and protected by a ten year-old boy (Henry Thomas) from government agents is so well known it doen't really have to be discussed.  E.T. is, alternately, magical, fantastic, suspenseful, and sometimes even a bit terrifying.  And sprinkled throughout the film are singular moments that really stand out as some of the most unforgettable scenes in cinematic history; by this time, I think we know what those are.  For me, perhaps the most priceless scene is the introduction between E.T. and Gertie (Drew Barrymore), where she screams her head off,  It is one of the very few times where I've wanted to laugh and scream at the same time!Spielberg's film, though scripted by Melissa Mathison, is almost painfully autobiographical, given what the director has said about his childhood. Like Spielberg, Thomas' character goes through life minus a father, even though his mother (Dee Wallace) does her best.  He feels isolated and picked upon in school, as Spielberg frequently did.  There is also plenty of religious symbolism that probably doesn't need any analysing and was probably unintentional.  In any case, looking past the fact that it won four Oscars--for sound, sound effects editing, special effects, and John Williams' legendary music score--and has grossed over $1 billion, E.T. is a masterpiece of the cinema, pure and simple, and it will always be that way.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

One of the Few Perfect Movies Ever Created,"I remembered that this was on Netflix, so I popped it on, not having seen it since my teenage years and this movie came out in 1982, the year I was born, so it has been a while.Viewing this movie through adult eyes was a powerful experience. I was of course reminded of the movie from my childhood having watched it dozens of times, but I didn't anticipate how drawn in and emotional I would feel over it.Everything about this movie was perfect, every beat of events, every line, every scene.I was powerfully drawn into the lives and interaction of the three siblings, as if I was there with the family. E.T. felt like truly an empath as a creature.And the acting with the siblings and especially the Elliott character was exceptional. I can't recall any other child performances from a child that age which was so real and brilliant.I'm the type that does not become emotional at movies, almost no matter what movie or what occurs, but I was no good at the end, even knowing every scene by heart. It just drew me into the felt experience of virtually every main character.The one criticism was that I felt as a critical adult, that the flying bikes seemed like too easy a plot point but hey, it's a somewhat family movie anyways. Although it's a little heavy for a standard family film.This is one of the greatest, most perfect pieces of film making every to occur and I hope that the younger generations can appreciate ET as my generation has.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Don't ruin your childhood memories,"Everyone remembers the feel-good story of ET. If you watch it now, you'll be disappointed.

Pure magic!,Christmas 1982. The hype has reached the UK big time. It's impossible to avoid it in magazines or on the TV or radio. Buy the soundtrack - John Williams finest work. The final statement of the theme in all its glory is magnificent. Get tickets for the Sunday morning premiere at the Birmingham Odeon. Watch the movie. Pure magic. 17 years later my perspective has changed a little. I still see the movie as an almost perfect example of film-making but some of the deeper issues now affect me more deeply - in particular the mother's rejection of the ailing alien. What makes me categorize this as a classic is that whenever I see an image or hear an excerpt of the soundtrack it brings back the emotions and sensations I had as I watched this beautiful story unfold before my eyes on that Sunday morning in December 1982 and remembered what it was like to be a child.,10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Back to childhood whoa. And not overrated really,"I'm not usually very emotional with these kind of emotional family films but this is was an exception.Now when I've grown up and watched in good quality as it could be I was totally shocked. I remembered from the age I was little kid that it was just cool touching and healing and something... Now it was little different experience.For the time being I think this is the most superb movie of 80's and I don't usually like Spielberg very much but this was fantastic. Original and all. Not some Independence Day like nowadays. Alien was really alien and brilliant movie, funny moments and all. Great directing, everything fits just like a glove.Maybe long movie but this one deserves it really.

SweET thirty  (cinematheque),"This is my third viewing of ""ET"" after its first broadcasting in French TV (canal +) and its release in theater on Christmas time in my grandparents' city. At this time, I haven't been able to appreciate it because everybody said it make cry and so while watching it, I was always telling me ""don't cry, don't cry"". I know how much we can be fool as kid. Now as an adult, i am mature and it's indeed a movie with great emotions. I still don't cry because instead I feel good. In fact, it's funny to see Spielberg tells a story from the point of view of a child and now as an adult, I can notice it. When I was a child, the movie wasn't so surprising. Actually, it's great to live again those days alone at home, the false colds, the garden from outer space, the first crush... It was also a good lesson of truth that an open heart as Elliot means total acceptance and sharing. He doesn't ask anything from ET but welcomes him as he is and offers him all his toys. If adults behave this way, the world would be a better place. Beyond, the movie is full of surprises: Star wars is everywhere, MacQuarrie designs the ship, there's a future Baywatch star and William's score is among his best ones. I'm agree with Splielberg when he says that Williams make him better. For those who desire to follow the adventure, they can read the book ""ET and the green planet"" which is a fine sequel.Pairing: ""Close encounters"".

"Good drama, but not the usual Sci-Fi summer blockbuster.","I have to admit that this movie left me wanting more action. But maybe I was expecting to much. From a Sci-Fi summer movie, I'd expect more action. But maybe Spielberg was trying to make that type of movie. I guess he wanted to try something new. For the most part he succeded. What I saw was good. Differant, but good. It has pretty cool effects and really good acting and plot for the type of movie it is. Some parts are a lttle hard to follow but the kids wouldn't mind at all. It's made for them anyway. So don't expect blood and guts like Alien, or even another great winner from Spielberg, Saving Private Ryan. Check it out. It's worth buying and your kids won't get tired of it for a LONG time.

An all-time classic,"When I went to see ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"", I saw a preview of ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"".

Well last night I watched the original version, which I saw a couple of times when I was a kid. The movie still hasn't lost its magical touch. ""E.T."" is one of the best movies that I've ever seen, a movie with heart, humor, and excitement that will live with us forever. The story about an alien stranded on Earth and the boy who takes him in and becomes his friend went on to become the biggest blockbuster of all-time. It stayed on top of the foreign box office list until Spielberg's ""Jurassic Park"" surpassed it worldwide in 1993. It stayed on top of the domestic box office list until George Lucas rereleased ""Star Wars"" in 1997 (that was complete with the new stuff that ""E.T."" is getting for its rerelease). Will ""E.T."" get back on top of the box office after its rerelease next year? Stay tuned. Winner of four Academy Awards (including Visual Effects and John Williams rousing score), ""E.T."" is a movie like ""Star Wars"" that stays with you forever.

"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly","I first saw this movie when I was 5, and I liked it pretty well.  My parents even bought for me...and I don't think I've watched it since (other than clips).  I cannot remember most of the jokes and dialogue in the movie, but I remember the big picture still.  After all, the movie is still popular.Let me start by saying that Spielberg entered in this movie some of the best aspects of filmaking and also some of the worst.  The movie is magical, especially for a young child.  The relationship between E.T. and the boy is indeed heartwarming, and the special effects are good enough to compete with Cameron. However, the disappointing aspects of this film overweighed the good in my mind.  This movie was rated PG-13 in some European countries.  Why? Spielberg lures kids in to watch this movie, only to tell them that parents are close-minded and completely out of touch with kids, while also encouraging children to defy their parents when they ""know"" all the answers. Now granted, Spielberg doesn't come right out and say it, but for very young kids, this atmosphere could be harmful.Moreover, much of the movie is directed to people who fall in love with lots of cute things.  I don't mind cute movies, but it is overdone in a movie which is meant to be a sci-fi movies for kids, and a serious drama for adults.  There are also many contrivances and plot holes that I believe are only accepted because the director was Speilberg and because it was a ""cool"" sci-fi flick.  However these do not affect my rating of the movie, as I also am willing to ignore some poor or formulaic writing when the rest of the movie is great.It seems I am in the minority on this movie.  Even AFI has it 25th best all time on their list.  But even throwing away all my personal taste, the message sent in this movie would still detract me from rating it among the classics.I give it a 4 (out of 10) for effort.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Show Me the Way to Go Home-Bohm-Bohm,"This movie pleases one's spirit. It's alive with ingenuousness, resilience and joy. It's also a hilarious comedy and an adventure. It's like other seminal Spielberg films like Close Encounters and the Indiana Jones trilogy, a movie you can mature and age with, and it'll never lose its luster. It's a story of companionship and devotion, and there's nothing manipulative or anti-intellectual about that. It's simply the personal sentiment of a master filmmaker's inner child. Critics and viewers of my generation, that is to say thirty years after the film's initial release, have been made so scornful by the saccharine lugubriousness of Spielberg's many Hollywood imitators in that time that they are repelled by what they see in this film as the romanticized America that Hollywood and politicians struggle to assure us actually exists. Well why don't we take a break from being presumptuous post-modern snarks and look at what's actually on the screen? Sure, the movie is set in and around a sprawling American suburb. The split-level houses stretch up and down the coiled drives, etched out of hills that become forest just beyond the backyard. But this suburban world, with its unsupervised kids, deeply lonely and depressed parents, busted toys and trademarked snack food, could've come out of The Ice Storm or American Beauty. Except one night in those woods, a spaceship lands, and eccentric little glowing silhouettes shamble through the night, seeking plant samples or whatever. Thenhumans turn up, powers that be with flashlights and trudging boots. They converge on the spacecraft, and it's coerced to desert one of its crew. This forsaken little being is discarded to a horrifying world of dogs, raccoons, car exhaustand nosy little boys.The movie is in effect a psychic autobiography, a picture of Spielberg as a normal suburban kid distinguished by a singularly impassioned, spiritual imagination. The hero is a certain little boy named Elliott, played by Henry Thomas, who doesn't give the impression of a coddled, over-trained kid. He's spontaneous as hell, hypersensitive, plucky and naive. He just knows there's something living out in the garden, and he waits all night with his flashlight, attempting to entice the alien to appear with a universally appealing inducement: Reese's Pieces. They become friends. The E.T. secretly moves into the house, and the movie's midsection is a continual development upon the idea of an extra-terrestrial's induction into bedrooms, TV, phones, refrigerators and beer. The alien has the capabilities of thought transference, and it shares its feelings with Elliott. That's how Elliott understands that the E.T. longs to go home.What's particularly magnificent about all of those moments is that Spielberg builds them out of Melissa Matheson's genuine plot developments. At each point from start to finish, this respected event picture is truly a narrative achievement. It unravels particulars about the E.T. It builds on the behavior of Elliott, his mother, brother and sister. It embroils federal space organizations. It deals with extra-terrestrial medicine, ecology and contact, and it rouses real laughter and sentiment.Much of those triumphs hinge on the extremely weird E.T. itself. Through its strange little waddle, its shrill screeches of shock, its exploratory replications of human tongue and its bizarrely raspy drone, E.T. becomes one of the most endearing imagined creatures in the movies. It's a success of special effects, of course, but it's also one of imagination, because the filmmakers had to conceive of this things, and experience our world through its wholly alien perspective to fashion a being so totally compelling. It's a triumph of empathy. While E.T. is the more obvious and frantic orphan, Elliott is in his own way bereaved of a home.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

This isn't a realist film, this isnt' supposed to realistic at all.  It's a fantasy of child who need someone in his life to connect with, to love.  It's a wonderful film, it captures a sense of what could be, of a state that we all long for, where things are simple, where we can still dream.There are some who pan the movie.  There are some who hate steven spielberg films, and they'll give it a bad review.  Well, let them have kubrick's baby.  Let them take their copy of 2001 in one hand and Rashomon in the other, and as they understand the aesthetic of a great film as art, and just let them go.  They don't what E.T. is about, they're too cynical and spiteful to enjoy something this pure.E.T. is about dreaming, about a childlike sence of wonder.  It's a beautiful film, and so many have embraced it because they can connect to it in some sense.  I'm sorry that people don't get that, or are too cynical to even try to understand it.  The rest of us can watch it become a timeless class, can show it to our kids, and even as we get older, may we still be inspired by innocence and magic.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The most beautiful movie ever made,"I really like Steven Spielberg's work. There are a few men we can actually use the term genius to call them and in his kind of cinema, Spielberg is the best. He has a special way to fill our room with magic every time we see one of his movies. Indiana Jones, Hook, Jurassic Park, Empire of the Sun, etc. But I think that with ""ET"" he reached the top. He pretty much gathered every magic he had and used it on this movie. I never cry with movies and no, I didn't cry with this one tough, in the famous final scene my stomach did hurt and the sentence ""I'll be right here"" really made me levitate. This is one of those movies that can actually transport us to an out-of-this-world-kind-of-adventure, the scene with the kids on the bicycles made me fly too just to follow perhaps the most sad ending of the entire history of cinema. A kid who befriends an alien creating a bound so strong that only the two of them could break. John Williams makes his best soundtrack yet, sad, tender and thrilling. Williams is my favourite composer, this man doesn't know how to make a bad score. Spielberg and Williams together and all of the crew just had to result in a movie like this. Just, absolutelly, the most beautiful movie I've ever seen. Friendship is the most transcendent feeling we can experience, specially beetween an Earth boy and a little alien. A true classic that should be seen by any family, any kid, any grownup, any.. anybody. Only a true cold-hearted wouldn't like this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
MY REVIEW: Extra Love from Outer Space!!,"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. I will say it is extra cute, extra sweet and extra lovely. E.T. the alien lands into the house of little sweet kid Elliott played by terrific Henry Thomas who lives with his mother, big brother and cute little sister played by Drew Barrymore. Elliott and E.T. become pals until their bond is tested by a group of scientists who are obviously interested in studying E.T. Steven Spielberg treats it as children movie but with state of the art special effects and directorial depth, here is too much to enjoy for adults as well. All interactions between E.T. and kids are super funny, Expressions of little Drew Barrymore are priceless and emotional bond of E.T. and Elliott is electric and full of heart. Movie never seems to be in hurry and gives you ample time to enjoy and absorb the sweetness of living a kid's fantasy. So don't waste time, find it and enjoy this special masterpiece of Steven Spielberg.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

One of the Most Heartwarming Films in Movie History!,"How can one describe the experience of watching E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial? It's almost impossible, there does not seem to be a word in the English dictionary that can fully describe the total experience of watching such a masterful film. It is moving, heart-wrenching, funny, optimistic, and exciting, all in one.One would think when they hear of the simple premise of a young boy befriending an alien from outer space that not much drama or emotion could be evoked, but that person would be wrong. E.T.'s true heart lies in its simplicity, through a child-like view of the world. As this is rightfully how this film should be, since it is told from the perspective of a child. I think it is because of this simplicity that E.T. has gone on to become one of the greatest films of all-time.When one debates about whether or not which film is director Steven Spielberg's masterpiece, talk quickly begins to circulate around Schindler's List, but in this filmgoers mind E.T. is just as beautiful and poignant as the story of Oskar Schindler. What Spielberg did with this film was simply magical; no other human on Earth could have made this film other than him. E.T. is a lovable character, even though he is so ugly. Spielberg made us care for a character who in the wrong hands would have just ended up being an ugly Muppet that'd terrify children, but thanks to the classic Spielberg touch E.T. was brought to life.While many cynics may bash the film for its all-out sentimentality and gentile nature, I must always hold my tongue from saying something in which I will later on regret. E.T.'s greatest strength lies within its sentimentality and its optimistic nature. It is just another testament to Spielberg's wonderful talents.Overall, I think E.T. is one of the most beautiful films of all-time. It is a film that'll make even the most hardened moviegoer cry, but never tears of sadness, but tears of joy and happiness. When you come to the end of E.T. you feel as if you just got off of one of the best emotional roller coaster rides of your life, and it never changes each time you ride it. This is one of cinema's finest achievements.I give E.T. a perfect 10 out of 10!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Far too sloppy to be anything but a decent film,"When I first saw this in '82, people everywhere were praising it. I saw a film whose structure and story fell apart if you asked too many questions. For instance:-Elliot and his friends are being chased. They take the air nozzles off the bad kids bikes and the tires deflate!(This is one of numerous convenient things that happen in Spielberg films that would stop the film dead in its tracks if they didn't happen.) -If ET can fly, why didn't he just fly back to his ship at the first sign of trouble? (Another Spielberg convenience.) -One kid, being chased by bad kids, leaves the road on his bike and flies off a cliff into the top of a forest. He shows up in the next scene without a scratch.(Ditto. It was ""cute."")These things, and many others, are stuck inside a sappy, unconvincing, feeble story about an extremely ugly alien who mooches on a stupid, naive kid until the alien's parents come back to get him. This is the 2nd of a long line of spielberg films that are chock full of errors, logic laps, pathetic dialogue(especially if spielberg writes it.), and indifferent direction. His worst films are Hook, The Lost World, Close Encounters, and Goonies.Rating: 6 out of 10. The rating is so high because it is fairly entertaining.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

E.T: the Limited Collector's Edition (2002) DVD,"My original review (2003):Besides Elliott shilling for Reese's Pieces, Pez and Coke, it is still all it's supposed to be. The kids are all talented and attractive and E.T. himself should have won an Oscar for his ""performance"". The effects are still quite magical and I think this ranks with ""Wizard of Oz"" as among the best films of its type.Though Mr. Spielberg tried a darker version of it with A.I., this one still can't be equaled. But the networks are beginning to wear it out!Further comments on the Limited Collector's Edition 2 DVD set (2001): Though I see nothing wrong with the original 1982 version, Mr. Spielberg thought there were shots that could be improved and he tried to do so. The new version is included on disk 1 and, by and large, I think he should probably have left well enough alone. Though I wasn't too put off by the changes, the scene, in the beginning, where E.T. is running from the feds is, in my opinion, less effective than the original where you only see a light ""running"".I also think the replacement of the agents' guns with walkie-talkies was awkwardly done even if it the director thought it was more ""politically correct"". The new computerized facial expressions of E.T. didn't bother me particularly.The extra features were very helpful and I especially enjoyed the section where John Williams conducts his score live at the Shrine Auditorium. This ""live"" performance may also be heard complete and with audience reactions as well in another section following the excerpted visuals of Williams conducting. There are plenty of shots of the cast in 2002 and they all seem to have aged well or almost not at all and they are also introduced to the Shrine audience at the end of that section.In the ""Reunion"" one can see also that Henry Thomas, the original Elliott, has retained his benevolent expression as has Robert MacNaughton despite his odd hairdo. Drew, (Give me a break!) of course, is ""terminally cute"" in this film. She steals it whenever she's on-screen.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The Thrill Is Gone,"I have to admit, when E.T. hit the theatres in 82 I was a big a suckeras anyone, compleatly drawn into the wave Speilberg had going at thattime. Going to the re-release, I was expecting to see one of those rareperfect, or near perfect, works of pop art only a Scrooge can resist.Well, I'm not a Scrooge, but alas, viewed with a light touch ofobjectivity, this movie is barely good. Perhaps in the years since wehave been clobbered with so much Oprah type  ca ca that E.T.'s warts allbut scream at you from the screen, and who need a screaming wart?The script has one, very limited virtue: it's cute. Speilberg wouldlater try to cute his way through stinkers like ""Always"" and ""Hook"", buteven well modulated Cute can only take you so far. We all know thestory, what really surprised me this time is, that's all there is.Major gripes: One of the things that no doubt made this a hit isJohn Williams, endless sledgehammer score, bashing every moment overyour head. Terrible. And Drew Berrymore, for all he hype, wasn't a verygood child actor. On the other hand, Henry Thomas is good, and ispossibly the one honest thing about this bombastic adorablefest.The cult of Saint Steven better get used to it: cooler heads willno doubt start to size up ""E.T."" more honestly as the years go by: Inote the rerelease was a big box office let down.

Drew Barrymore is so cute and relatable if you have a bratty little sister. The main character was such a great actor with much talent.

Most Overrated Spielberg prior to Saving Private Ryan,"At least ET didn't trash the wonderful veterans of World War II and the D Day Invasion like Private Ryan did; no, it's a harmless little movie. In retrospect, way too smug in the aliens-are-OK insider stance with Peter Coyote and... and, well just quite a few alien lovers in the film. I rate it 2 rather than 1 for the breakfast scene with a still young Drew Barrymore and her ""alligators in the sewers"" line; but this film, like the filmmaker Spielberg, has no real character or backbone. Family Classics, true classics, have one thing in common: They remain classics year-after-year. Like Wizard of Oz, still new after 66 years. Poor E.T. has no resilient value either at the box office or on television. Poor old Sears bought the TV rights for several years of annual runs. Trouble was, nobody much watched. Now Sears doesn't bother exercising their right-to-play anymore. This film did, however, make big dollars in its initial run. As always, the All Time Hit list failed to reflect constant dollar figures, thus squeezing out the true all-time hit SNOW WHITE, which cost 20c to see --- made at a time when $800 was a really good annual income.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Especially, I think he is good at making his facial expression. It is not too much say that he is a genius child actor. Then, I also like this film itself. This is because I feel this film teaches us that we can establish an emotional bond with even aliens. I don't know whether they really exist or not.

E.T. One Of The Best Sci-Fi Movies Ever Made,"E.T. is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made from acclaimed director Steven Spielberg who does a great job of making this movie about a group of children who try to help a stranded alien return home. The whole cast are exceptional in their roles including Dee Wallace, Peter Coyote, Drew Barrymore, and Henry Thomas as Elliot the boy who befriends the alien. The rest of the cast are good in their roles as well. The special effects are amazing too especially for that time. I can't think of one thing I didn't like about this movie. The ending was fitting and will have some girls in tears. The music matched perfectly with what was happening on the screen and the tone of the film. Overall E.T. is a terrific sci-fi movie with a touching story, drama, humor, some action, and great performances by the cast that I highly recommend to any whose a fan of the genre.

A Timeless Classic,"I just want to take a few minutes to talk about one of my personal favorite films of all time. And as far as Spielberg films are considered it is my favorite. But firstly I want to get out of the way the flaws of the film, every film has them, even films I hold to high regard. Honestly, it's hard to find any flaws since this is a nearly perfect film in every aspect. You can't criticize the visuals since it was made in the 1980s, but I think the performances by the kids other than Thomas, Barrymore, and MacNaughton could have used some work, of course featuring also a young C. Thomas Howell, but it's not terrible. Now that I got that out of the way, let's talk about what makes this film so special and timeless. Firstly, Steven Spielberg's direction as always is masterful, especially when it came to getting the best possible performances out of the main characters, and the main characters are children. Spielberg always knows how to capture that childlike innocence in a film without being sappy, and it's wonderfully displayed here. Secondly, the main kids themselves who are the heart, soul, and blood flow of this movie each with groundbreaking performances especially by Henry Thomas as Elliott, and a cute and young Drew Barrymore as Gertie. Robert MacNaughton sort of serves as the middle man, being conflicted with the ways of an adult but still preserves that childlike wonder when he too meets ET. Thirdly, the master himself John Williams proved yet again why is one of the greatest musicians of all time. After musical hits from Jaws, Star Wars, and Raiders of the Lost Ark, he comes in here and gives arguably his best score before or after. He himself made you believe a boy and alien on a bicycle can fly. And without Williams music that bicycle scene with Elliott and ET flying across the moon wouldn't be anywhere near as iconic. Or the chase scene with the police wouldn't feel as intense without his music. And lastly but certainly not least, ET himself. It is a outstanding job on the creators of this magnificent alien. A bunch of people collaborated to make him including sound designers, makeup artists, costume artists, Spielberg, and many many others and together they made him as believable as you could possibly make him during that time. His voice is provided by Pat Welsh, and Debra Winger also contributed heavily to the character. I also don't want to forget the adult actors involved including Dee Wallace, and Peter Coyote, they too do a great job serving as a lense from an adults point of view of the film and the situations within. Overall, this is a film that should never be touched, Spielberg struck gold with this film and he recognizes that. Many films afterwards that deal with a friendship between a boy and another otherworldly being or animal have to owe it to this film. As the friendship between Elliott and ET is a friendship that people will look back on as one of the greatest. And the film itself should be considered one of the greatest films of all time. As a result this film easily gets a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Forever a classic...,"E.T. the Extra Terrestrial is the best family movie ever made. It's something everyone can enjoy no matter how old you are. Now, children who are too young to have seen it when it was first released (like myself), get to see it on the big screen with never before seen footage, a new soundtrack, and special effects enhancements.A spaceship lands on Earth and little brown men venture out to study this strange planet. When a group of government officials show up, the aliens flee leaving one behind by accident. This alien is known as E.T. when is found by a young boy, Elliot (Henry Thomas). He shows his brother Michael (Robert MacNaughton) and his sister Gertie (Drew Barrymore), but they keep it a secret from their mother (Dee Wallace). They teach E.T. to talk and Elliot develops a strong bond with the little creature. A bond so strong, that E.T. can communicate with Elliot through his mind. Whatever E.T. is feeling, Eliot feels. This is demonstrated in a classic scene in which E.T., at the house, discovers beer and gulps down about three of them. Eliot, at school, gets drunk as well and lets out all of the frogs they are about to dissect in science class. E.T. begins to grow sick as the government officials start to find E.T.'s hiding place.E.T. is an absolute classic. Seeing it on the big screen was like seeing it for the very first time. I have one thing to gripe about, though. The new enhancements to E.T.'s face are both distracting and unnecessary. They are obvious, like the great scene where E.T. says, `E.T. phone home.' It would have worked better if they just made the enhancements to eyes, rather that the entire face. The new scene is funny and doesn't slow up the pacing of the movie. At least it wasn't as bad as the whole `Greedo shoots first' scene in the rerelease of Star Wars.The reason no other family film has come close to being as great as E.T. is because Steven Speilberg had faith in his kids. He wasn't afraid to add scary scenes or touchy language. He adds emotion and sympathy to his characters. But now, family films are all about slapstick and toilet humor, which E.T. is thankfully missing.I love E.T. It's charming and smart. It's a film where one laughs, cries, and conjures up about every emotion known to man. Stephen Speilberg is the best storyteller of them all. The rerelease of E.T. is greatly appreciated, but the annoying enhancements are not. If it's not broken, don't fix it.---------10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The first 30 minutes of this movie moves at a snail's pace and it is like watching paint dry.

"If I sound bitter, it's because I loved this film when it first came out..","I would have been nine or so.  It just goes to show that you should be deeply sceptical of the aesthetic judgements of a nine-year-old - even if that nine-year-old is yourself.  What a let-down it was to watch the film later and realise I'd been had!Not completely had: John Williams's score, one of his very best, is still stunning (the only part of the film that doesn't show its age, in fact); Spielberg moves from scene to scene with great assurance, hiding from a trusting audience the fact that he's telling a story that makes little sense; and I must admit that the two key children, Henry Thomas and Drew Barrymore, have both charm and talent.There's also a great bicycle chase scene.  We need more bicycle chases - this one is easily the highlight of the film.But couldn't Spielberg have spent his resources on a story that didn't fall apart when exposed to bright light?  For a start this shouldn't have been a science fiction story.  Pure fantasy would have worked better.  (Impure fantasy, which is what this is, always feels awkward.)  We have a supposedly intelligent alien race, capable of mounting a sophisticated interstellar expedition - or, in other words, sneaking into the outskirts of Los Angeles at night for an hour or so only to scuttle off in fear when, surprise, surprise, humans appear.  What did they expect?  Oh - and they fail to notice that one of their number isn't aboard when they take off.  How smart are these aliens, exactly?  Judging from ET himself (there's some reason to think of it as a he), brighter than dogs, not so clever as chimps.  And then there's the way the stranded ET alerts the other ETs that he's missing - with a ploy that comes straight out of `Gilligan's Island'.  Nope: the trappings of science fiction don't suit this story at all.Not that removing them would remove any non sequiturs from the script.  Why does ET suddenly recover?  Why must he be hidden from NASA?  Why must he be hidden from Elliot's mother?  And is there ANY explanation for the behaviour of the aliens as a whole?  I'm not unearthing irrelevancies here: all these things drive the plot.But who cares, you can hear the director thinking, the kids won't notice any of this until they're older.  He's probably right.

Hmm ...ACTING:
The acting was good, but why does white, liberal ""Hollowood"" produce films that are so blatantly RACIST?One black person in the whole film, and he got 15 seconds of fame.Speaking of good acting, this film should remind us that child ""actors"" often don't develop into competent adult
actors, e.g. Drew Barrymore.TEMPO:
OK, but nearly all of Shpeelberg's films are the classic male-version of story: build, build, climax! Oy ...CINEMATOGRAPHY:

May have been good in the 80s...but not anymore.,"E.T, a so-called great film by Steven Spielberg. Is a kids film, fact. But is not only a kids film, is a kids film that is considered one of the greatest films of all-time, acclaimed critically and a great success on the box office...wow, right?No, no really. This film may have been good in the time it was released, I mean, there are a lot of '80s values' on it, and I understand, it talks about the 'magic' of the childhood...but, it talked strictly for the 80s generation, I mean, for an older and different audience, there is simply no way to connect with this film at all. It's dull, outdated, and totally uninteresting. The characters are shallow, so I couldn't care less for them. And again, very dull. The film is about kids doing dull things, so despite the story being technically perfect for the 80s standards, nowadays it's just a boring film with nothing to offer for the newer audiences.I also disliked the soundtrack. So annoying and sketch. It was used in the film to.attenuate the scenes, and it don't worked anytime. And I almost walked out in the most bizarrely manipulative moment of the film, the ending, much because of the John Williams horrible music.The E.T is very similar to the weird baby in Eraserhead(David Lynch, 1978), I found this detail pretty interesting. But all in all, not deserving of it's classic status. 5.0/10",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Steven Spielberg's finest hour.,"ET is such a wonderful film.  I think its a film about the way a child views the world, and the way an adult views the world.  A child's mind is not cyncial, unlike the adults in the picture.  There is a vast gap between the child's world and the adult world.This is probably Spielberg's most personal film, he grew up in suburbia, he was part of a single parent family, he has a wildly imaginative mind.There are so many classic moments, more so than any film released in the last 30 years.  The bicycles flying past the moon is one of the greatest moments in cinema history.  The John Williams score is timeless. Unforgetable quotes ""ET phone home""One of the greatest of all time.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Whoever gives this film lower than a 10 is WRONG.,"Jaws is my favorite movie ever. But E.T. is just as much of a masterpiece as Jaws is. What made Jaws so great was the fact that it was a horror movie with tons of gore, but it was also a coming-of-age story about how Brody has to get over his dislike of the water. In E.T. The Extra Terrestrial, it follows Elliot surpassing being an adult and having to deal with E.T. being gone(in such a phenomenal ending scene that will bring on tears for generations upon generations to come). The effects, the score, the story, the characters are ALL excellent. As for the 2002 20th Anniversary version, the movie, other than a few politically correct changes I dread like the shotgun replacement and the terrorist line change, is still timeless no matter what, even with the CGI enhancements. Overall, E.T. is just fantastic. What else can be said??!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A movie that gets better with age,"""E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial"" (1982), one of the most famous science fiction films ever made, needs no introduction. Even if you're not the biggest filmfreak you'll know without a doubt that it was directed by the one and only Mr. Steven Spielberg. Upon its release date in 1982 the world fell in love with this oddly creature from outer-space. Not that it matters much, but even Lady Diana and Ronald Reagan were moved to tears after seeing this film. But what were those secret ingredients that made E.T. as unforgettable as it turned out to be?Spielberg takes us on a trip in an American suburban development. Out in the wilderness a spaceship lands at night, with odd-looking creatures taking what seems to be samples of trees and plants. After being startled by humans the creatures depart again into outer-space. There is just one problem, they forgot one of their friends, E.T. Without spoiling too much of the script E.T. befriends a little boy named Elliott and an adventure for both little 'men' begins.Our hero in this particular film, besides E.T., is in the human form of Elliott who's played by Henry Thomas, a now former child actor who gives an extraordinary performance. The strength of his performance lies in the fact that it comes across as very natural and childlike. What Thomas feeds his character is something rarely seen around child-actors in Hollywood films.Upon watching ""E.T"" again, for probably the 20th time or so, it becomes clear that this film tells much more than just the story about a little boy befriending an ""Extra-Terrestrial"". In its essence ""E.T."" deals about friendship and love. The sequential story develops the back-story of our little creature, the personality of Elliott, the relationships between the humans and so on. All of this is told in a fluently manner that makes us, as viewers, involved in what is actually a creature created by special effects. We empathize in the friendship between Elliott and E.T, sometimes with tears and sometimes with laughs.""E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial"" is a film that drives on a stream of different emotions throughout its entire runtime and Spielberg serves us just the right amount of these emotional ingredients. The film has moments of childlike innocence and hope, funny and exciting moments and a sequence that's so tear-dropping even Conan the Barbarian with blow his nose during the end credits. In the end E.T. is one of the most remarkable characters ever created in Modern Cinema and a film that ,like fine wine, only gets better with age.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""E.T."" Still Right Here","""E.T. The Extraterrestrial"" may not be Steven Spielberg's best film from the 1980s - ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" or ""The Last Crusade"" probably holds that prestigious title - but it still ranks very high on the list, and unlike the Indiana Jones movies, it is the one that plays best with children. Therefore, it retains a far-reaching, family oriented appeal for the generations.When an alien is left behind on a scientific journey to planet Earth, he befriends a ten-year-old boy in the San Fernando Valley named Elliot (Henry Thomas). Curious and compassionate, Elliot takes the creature into his home and upon learning his celestial origins, names him E.T. Elliot introduces E.T. to his older brother, Mike (Robert MacNaughton) and his younger sister, Gertie (Drew Barrymore). Fearing that grown ups will want to capture and experiment on the lost being, though, he keeps him hidden from all adults, including his mother (Dee Wallace).It is a story of friendship and learning. As Elliot and E.T. get to know each other, the alien builds an understanding of human feelings and language. Eventually, he is able to articulate his desire to return home, and creates a satellite to call out to his space-dwelling peers. At the same time, however, sinister forces from the government are searching for E.T., wanting to study him and blockade his departure.Because the adults view E.T. in such clinical terms, the film champions the triumph of childhood innocence and imagination. Despite how unfamiliar E.T. is, Elliot does not hesitate to help him. Although the mother and government officials are not necessarily evil, the kids are the true heroes here. Only they are willing to save the titular being, and in the end, they succeed over the adults in their good-natured actions. The movie reminds us that the complicated, cautious, or bureaucratic grown up solutions are not always the right ones.Since E.T. is an alien, the film is partially a science fiction movie as well. However, the only obvious piece of sci-fi iconography is the extraterrestrial himself (and the brief instances of his spaceship). E.T. is a unique looking brown thing, designed by special effects artist Carlo Rambaldi. While wrinkled and stout, E.T. also has the capacity for expression through his wide emotive blue eyes. Even if the picture's other special effects - from floating ornaments to flying bicycles - appear dated by today's standards, the practical E.T. puppet has stood the test of time, much to the movie's benefit.Other causes for celebration include John Williams' fantastic score and the great child acting. Through ""E.T.,"" Speilberg proved his aptitude for working with children. Not only does Melissa Mathison's script tap into a childlike perspective, but the signature directing style is something that evokes nostalgic wonder.Thirty-eight years later, ""E.T."" still excites audiences. Parents who grew up with it can now watch it with their own children, and parties both new and old will find inspiration in the timeless tale. Without giving anything away, in the final scene, E.T. assures Elliot ""I'll Be Right Here."" Given the movie's legacy, he might as well have been addressing the audience.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Kids Flick,"While some movies, with Aliens (clue is in the title) are not really suitable for kids, this one is made for them. And while a recent effort (DVD release) made some changes to make the movie even more kid ""friendlier"", this still remains one of the best movies Steven Spielberg made.Most will be familiar with the movie, because it's a movie that is not only shown on TV, but a movie that is genuinely loved by many. A movie that parents like to watch with their kids. A fantasy (fairy?) tale for everyone then? I would say so, but of course, as with everything else, people have different tastes and therefor, there are also people who will despise this movie. Some might even hate the fact, that some themes could be (and have been) interpreted as Christian symbolisms.

The Best Movie That Disney Never Made,"This film has all the traits of a great Disney film.  The only problem with it: IT WASN'T DISNEY.  Steven Speilberg once again spread his magic across the world.  And while this is a wonderful film, I still can't believe that this was the highest grossing film for a long time.  Star Wars was only five years old when ET came out so how did Et out gross the biggest popcorn movie of them all?",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Sometimes time wears out an experience,"Great watch, can't say I'd want to watch it again, but I recommend everyone should see this at least once.It's a great movie, really well made, and everyone should know this one, historically, if nothing else. This is REALLY dated though, not just in the available technology, the quality of the practical effects, or that the little girl (Drew Barrymore) was drinking and doing coke backstage (allegedly?). The FEEL of it, the music that was clearly borrowed (and possibly expanded) for later projects.As good as it is, writing is probably the strongest aspect, and there just isn't that ""oompf"" to compete with modern movies. It has weak touches of charm here and there, but it wants to be more of a 1980s dirt comedy than a family movie of wonderment: honestly reminds me a lot of ""Paul"".And part of me just hopes this isn't what first contact looks like: stupid terran kids aside, E.T. had to have been senile or retarded (no, it not funny) for this series of events to happen. He knows he's from off planet, and maybe EVERYONE on his ship knows how to make a transmitter, but when he thinks he sees another alien he speaks English to it. Details like that are littered through the movie and will break the magic you should have (and it's there) when Spielberg wanted you to just concentrate on the shot he created.I don't think you'll have a bad time, I probably just got too close to the screen.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
review of E.T.,E.T. is a really good movie. I like Science fiction. The special effects are old but it's also attractive. All the new movies now are made with new technology. E.T. has been made without all of this but it's still known and a lot of peoples still like this movie. E.T. is a pleasing emotional story and I think it's never boring. Some scenes are really funny but on the other hand some scenes are sad and serious. I like it. The characters are really nice. Eliot plays very well his role.

I Will Always Watch This Movie As a 7-Year-Old Boy,"There are some movies it's simply impossible to review with a critical eye, and ""E.T."" is one of them. Come on -- I was seven when this movie came out. I belonged an E.T. fan club, for God's sake! Let's just say that Steven Spielberg is in his element when working on movies like this, and it's only when he devotes himself to unadulterated fantasy and adventure that his penchant for over sentimentalization is bearable.I recently saw John Williams conduct music from several of his film scores at the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and one of the pieces they performed was a medley set to images from the respective films, ""E.T."" among them. I'm becoming such a sap as I get older that just the theme and some shots of little Drew Barrymore in pigtails almost made me cry.Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Still spellbinding...,"The thing that struck me as I sat down to watch this film was, although I've seen it several times before, I never realised just how good the musical score, by John Williams, was. I'm not just talking about the well known themes, it goes without saying that these are epic, I'm on about the much quieter themes, particularly at the beginning of the film, they are very subtle, but fit the on-screen action perfectly.It's not a film with any great performances, although everyone did a pretty good job; Henry Thomas as Elliott was pretty annoying at times, but it has to be said, he was also pretty good at the emotional stuff. Dee Wallace as Mary, the mother, did a pretty good job, as did Robert MacNaughton as Michael. Also worthy of note was Peter Coyote as the government agent, Keys; although he didn't have an awful lot to do he did it pretty well. For me, the star of the show was a very young Drew Barrymore, who was quite adorable as Gertie.I said earlier there were a few flaws which, for me anyway, prevented this film getting a higher score. One of these was the design of E.T.; yes I know he's quite iconic now but I always felt it looked like a small man in a plastic suit. He's also far too cute. The other thing that lets it down a bit is the CGI, I know it's only really used in a couple of scenes and the technology was in its infancy back then, but I'm afraid modern equipment does show it's limitations. As far as the story, the production and the direction of the film goes, all top notch and well worthy of all the praise it's got over the years. And even with these 'flaws', as I've called them it's still well worth the couple of hours it takes to watch!...

E.T. = Exceptionally Touching,"Life isn't easy for Elliot. His dad is south of the border. His brother's nerd squad relegates him to observer status during games of D&D. As if this weren't enough to contend with, he likely also has to endure constant questions from his peers.

Is he a deformed elf, a leprechaun from the sewer, an alligator kid?

Elliot is emotionally stranded in a suburb quite possibly in close proximity to the neighborhood from Poltergeist.This classic film taught us some important life lessons. Reese's Pieces are the way to a new friend's heart. No home-made radar is complete without a Mr. Spell. Government agents are no match for kids on BMX bikes. As a kid, viewing E. T. presented a whole new perplexing world. I could not for the life of me understand this strange reality where the mother laughs when one of her kids accuses the other of ingesting male genitalia in his spare time. Whatever the case, E. T. is an exspecially endearing adventure. The score provided by John Williams is of course triumphant and magical, but the music accompanying the moments with the agents snooping around also creates an unsettling tension.

The Film is the Most Beautiful friendship movie ever made, and shows what friends should do for each other.Henry Thomas, Drew Barrymore, Michael MacNaughton and Dee Wallace are extra terrestrial(get it?!) in their roles. The acting really portrays what kids are like, and what an alien looks like to a kid. Elliot sees E.T as a friend, because he took the time know him in the inside, and didn't simply make a judgment on the way he looks. Elliot teaches a lesson everyone needs to know, but often forgets. Don't judge a book by its cover. Or in this case, don't judge Aliens by their Image. E.T wasn't a threat, but the adults mistreated him, because of their own selfish reasons.

Over-rated but still worth a look,"I avoided the movie when it was first released because I thought to myself it's going to be about all these smart-aleck, over-talkative, full-of-themselves kids and how they saved this cute little Alien from the hands of the FBI.

But when my local DVD store offered the Single Disc Special Edition for a mere $6.50, how could I pass it up? Yes, the movie was almost as bad in its storyline and characterizations -- even worse in fact, as the mother is presented as an even worse bimbo than her kids with not even half a brain in her skull -- but the little creature himself is anything but your usual cutesy-cutesy, and that in itself makes a very agreeable change.

However, the film itself is also really touching. I think the film is nicely put together. E. T is wonderfully done, this was a time when CGI, computer-generated effects, were not used much. The film's main character is Elliott played by Henry Thomas, who gets a new friend from E. T. Certain scenes in the movie will go down in history like Elliott riding a bike with E.

This story has many dreams that people go to universe in the future and meet extra-terrestrials for most of history. Everyone never gives up coming true this dream. This film makes everyone's dream happen. I highly recommend you to watch this film.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Simply AMAZING!,"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982, Dir. Steven Spielberg)StoryElliot is your normal boy, until one day, when he meets a little lost alien. Elliot decides to keep the alien, in which he gives the name E.T. Elliot works with E.T. in trying to find him a way to get back home. Elliot must make the difficult sacrifice. Whether to help his new friend or to lose him? Whatever the decision is, Elliot must keep him hidden, as someone else is out to look for him.ActorsThe actors are perfectly chosen for this film. Henry Thomas fits into Elliot and acts as if he is actually Elliot. The rest of the family played by Dee Wallace, Drew Barrymore and Robert MacNaughton, all are so emotionally played that they seem to actually be related. They all act and react around ET as if he is actually there.MusicLike many of Steven Spielberg's film, the films composer is John Williams, and like always, John William creates an emotional soundtrack which adds to the viewing experience. There is simply nothing bad you can say about this soundtrack, there are so many beautiful themes and heard, and defiantly one of John Williams's best work.Special EffectsFor a film released in the early 80s, the special effects seen are actually very decent. The spaceship looks amazing, especially when it is taking off into the school. The ET puppet is also amazing and looks so realistic. Even to today, the effects look amazing.ConclusionE.T. the Extra-terrestrial is a classic Spielberg and should bring a smile to anyone's face. It's the perfect film to watch as a family, and not that frightening for the younger audience. To put it plain and simple, this is amazing.""Maybe an elf or a leprechaun""  Michael (Robert MacNaughton) ""It was nothing like that, penis breath!""  Elliot (Henry Thomas)",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
