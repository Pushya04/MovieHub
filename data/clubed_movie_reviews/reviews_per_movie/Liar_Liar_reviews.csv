One of Jim Carrey's funniest movies,"This movie is absolutely hilarious! There are few movies as humorous as this one, being ""Mousehunt"" one of those few - another 1997 motion picture.Every minute of ""Liar Liar"" is pure fun and every minute means a good laughter. Many moments are hysterical! Jim Carrey is often a great comedian, but this is him at his funniest side.The story is very funny and entertaining: Fletcher Reede, a lawyer with the habit of lying and breaking promises, suddenly sees himself forced to become honest during the next 24 hours after his son's birthday wish comes true. He doesn't understand what's happening to him and that is driving him insane... he can't tell any lies, not even write a little lie! Whenever he tries to and whenever he talks, it's a huge mess for sure! He even transforms the court room into a circus, seems to lose his mind and makes goofy faces! Incredibly hilarious!The actors have great performances. Jim Carrey is great as Fletcher Reede, but there are other equally good actors, like Maura Tierney as Audrey Reede, Cary Elwes as Jerry and little Justin Cooper as Max (Fletcher's son). Max is also referred to as ""Maximillian"" and ""Monster Max"" by his father, who loves to do ""The Claw"" much for his son's delight. I know Cary Elwes from ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"" and I do know that he is an English actor, but he speaks with a good American accent in this film. Some might think that Jim Carrey overacts here and that his humor is too crummy, but the energy he shows here is not something anybody could do. It requires a very energetic and patient comedian and Jim Carrey proves his talent to do so. The kid is cute. He almost looks like Sean Marshall in ""Pete's Dragon"", with that face and long hair.At my point of view, ""Liar Liar"" has funny humor, not irritating or dirty humor. It is a modern light-hearted comedy. Its aim is purely fun at the highest level. I think it's difficult not laughing while watching this movie. Lots of very funny lines are another attribute.Directed by Tom Shadyac, ""Liar Liar"" is the best thing Jim Carrey and Tom Shadyac ever did together and slightly superior than the later ""Bruce Almighty"".",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pants on fire,"Jim Carrey puts so much energy and pure comedic brilliance into this movie that we hardly noticed how corny and hackneyed was the plot or how wearily didactic was the moral lesson for all fathers who neglect their children for the goddess of success. And really we didn't care. What we loved almost as much as Carrey's rubber mouth and oral blockage (like an overheated boiler fighting not to explode) was the premise: a lawyer that can't lie. Now there's an oxymoron! As Carrey tries to explain to his son Max, lawyers need to lie. Actually he says grownups need to lie, which is a truth that we really do not need to exam too closely here. To laugh at something deeply troubling in our nature is a way of dealing with it.So the genius of this movie is first the talent of Jim Carrey, but second, for kids who come to the realization of adult mendacity for the first time, it is the discovery of comedy as a way to cope. Why do adults need to lie? is a question that a kid can never figure out, and then by the time he is an adult himself (or actually a teenager), he can no longer comprehend how important the question once was. Call it innocence lost, or the socialization process.My favorite part of the movie is the courtroom scene with Jennifer Tilly dressed oh so sluttily and her adulterous beaux looking like a model for the cover of a romance novel and Carrey in tatters in his $900 suit. Second would be the bathroom scene in which Carrey tries to tear himself apart (and seems to almost succeed). His flapping mouth between the toilet seat and the bowl was inspired. Give some credit to director Tom Shadyac, who managed to steer the vehicle with Carrey at the controls, and to writers, Paul Guay and Stephen Mazur, who wrote some funny lines.The great comedians totally let themselves go. They are totally on. They go to extremes and beyond. It's like transcending not just the ordinary, but even the imagined. See this obviously for Jim Carrey, one of the great comedic talents of our time, an original who would have delighted Charlie Chaplin with his extraordinary muggings, his blatant audacity and his suburb timing.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

"Jim Carrey is back in yet another great comedy, although it doesn't quite live up to the spectacular Dumb & Dumber.","Liar Liar is about a boy who, after being stood up by his big-shot lawyer father one too many times, wishes that for just one day his dad couldn't lie. This wreaks havoc on his personal life and even more on his professional life as a lawyer who makes a living putting criminals back on the streets.Carrey is immediately and constantly hilarious in his role as the unwillfully honest Fletcher Reede. Every scene is full of awkwardly straightforward behavior and dialogue (""Whatever takes the focus off your head!) that is funny because it is so unusual and unexpected. Maura Tierney delivers one of the best performances of her career (second only to her wonderful job in Primal Fear), but Cary Elwes plays a disappointing turn from his amazing job in The Princess Bride. Seeing him as the endlessly charming Wesley in that film and then seeing him as a squirrely step-father type in Liar Liar just didn't seem to fit, but the film was able to overcome such small problems and present itself as a good and entertaining comedy.In addition to the good comedy that Liar Liar presented, there were strange comedic scenes that Carrey had never done before. For example, I have never seen him portray a descent into madness as was shown with the blue pen, and it should be noted how well this funny man played the part of a man trying very hard not to be funny, with hilarious results. This is a bit like his role in Man on the Moon where he was a comedian playing a comedian who was often deliberately not funny, and the results there were hilarious as well. Jim Carrey's great comedy acting skills were a crucial element of this film, but they are not the only redeeming value of the movie itself. The story is solid and legitimate as well, and it is well-presented and directed, resulting in a good, fun comedy.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Carrey at his best,"I have to admit, I'm probably a little biased with this movie, as it contains two of the things I love the most in any movie; court scenes and Jim Carrey. I'll try my best to be objective in this review, though. The plot is good, and as the film barely takes 90 minutes it's fairly fast-paced(well, for a Jim Carrey comedy, anyway); I don't think there ever passes 5 minutes without one single joke. The acting is fairly good; Jim Carrey is in his element, so it's no surprise that he's good, but I did find both Maura Tierney and Cary Elwes pretty good too. I know that Elwes is English, not American, and after seeing another movie in which he has a strong English accent(Robin Hood: Men in Tights), I was impressed at how well he does American parts as well. The characters are well-written and credible. The humor is great, partly because it's, well, Carrey, but also because unlike some of Carrey's previous roles, this is fairly ""clean"", so teenagers and some kids will be able to enjoy it as well. The theme of the film is great; I mean, we all know that we lie several times a day(heck, it's even been scientifically proved), but what about if we, for one whole day, couldn't tell one single lie? Great theme, provokes some thought and is executed fairly well in the film, though I do think it could have been done a tad better. Overall, I don't have any major complaints with the film though; I guess it could be argued that most of what Carrey does in this film, the comedy and all, is stuff he's done before, but that's OK; it's not any less entertaining here, regardless of the fact that we've seen it(or something similar to it) earlier. The dialog is great, with some very memorable and quotable lines. All in all, a typical Carrey film, which can be a good thing as well as bad; Carrey does exactly what you expect him to, and he's very entertaining and all, but it never transcends the standard level of the typical Carrey comedy. On a final note, I think this(as well as his other work) proves that Tom Shadyac is the best there is at bringing out Carrey's talents(he also directed Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and Bruce Almighty). I recommend it to any fan of Jim Carrey and/or Tom Shadyac. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Gotta love the concept,"Jim Carrey is an attorney, who finds putting his family before his work to be a tough challenge, when he fails to show up at his son's birthday party; his son make a wish that prevents him from lying. With a huge career changing case that is based solely on lies about to go to trial, he is stuck in an unfamiliar position, that may just change his life.Jim Carrey is on top form for this one, giving one of his most hilarious performances to date, he is well supported by the likes of Jennifer Tilly, Swoosie Kurtz and Amanda Donohue, and the winning concept of the movies theme realises its potential.7/10 Great fun",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""I CAN'T LIE!!!""",Jim Carrey plays a liar lawyer called Fletcher Reede.His son Max (Justin Cooper) makes a birthday wish that his father can't tell a lie in 24 hours.And the wish comes true.

Good spirited and absolutely  hilarious film!,"True the plot is a little corny, my only criticism of the movie, but Jim Carrey's wonderfully energetic and most of the time hilarious performance more than compensates. Liar Liar is easily one of Carrey's better films, I do confess I will need to see a few more of his movies before concluding which one's his best to save bias. What Liar Liar manages to do is have a slightly corny though very interesting idea, and make into a good spirited and absolutely hilarious film. The script almost the whole time verged on hysterically funny, and there are many priceless scenes, especially the courtroom scene- I needed to go to the bathroom to check I hadn't wet myself from laughing so much. The other performances were great, Cary Elwes was excellent, and the boy was very sweet and charming. Overall, a hilarious movie, that does cheer you up considerably after a hard day, I still chuckle even thinking of it. There is so much to recommend this, but at the end of the day, it is Carrey's picture. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Has Its Moments, But Wears Thin","This is another of fairly-early Jim Carrey films in which he played a dopey, exaggerated character that is funny but can wear thin on you after awhile. It's almost exhausting to watch this guy for over more than 45 minutes at one time with all the gyrations, rubber faces, screaming and yelling. I am glad he has mostly abandoned roles like this since the turn of the century and done a lot better work.But, the premise of the film is good and there are genuine some laugh-out-loud scenes, mainly early on in the film. If the language and Jim had just been toned down a bit, this would have a really good movie.Once again, this PG-13 rating is a joke. It is not what you want your young teens to watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I love this movie!!,"I loved this movie, it's so funny :D one of the best comedy movies ever!!! It has (like many movies) a message, that it's best to tell the truth, but above all it was very funny. My favorite scene was:About Mr. AllenMiranda: Well, what do you think of him? Fletcher: He's a pedantic, pontificating, pretentious bastard, a belligerent old fart, a worthless steaming pile of cow dung, figuratively speaking. a moment passes and Mr. Allen starts laughing. The other board members follow his lead and start laughing also] Mr. Allen: That's the funniest damn thing I have ever heard. You're a real card, Reede. I love a good roast. Do Simmons. Fletcher: Simmons is old. He should have been out of the game years ago but he can't stay home because he hates his wife. You have met her at the Christmas parties, she's the one that gets plastered and calls him a retard, and you, Tom; you're the biggest brown nose I have ever seen. You have got your head so far up Mr. Allen's ass, I can't tell where you end and he begins. Mr. Allen: *roaring with laughter* Priceless! *Fletcher continues with every member* Fletcher: You have bad breath caused by gingivitis. You couldn't get a porn star off. Your hairpiece looks like something that was killed crossing the highway. I don't know whether to comb it or scrape it off with a shovel and bury it in lime. Loser! Idiot! Wimp! Degenerate! *Slut*!

More over the top than even Jerry Lewis,"I do not believe in reincarnation, but there is no doubt in my mind that Jim Carrey is the reincarnation of Jerry Lewis. As a kid, I was a huge fan of Lewis, but if you find his acting annoyingly over the top, it is nothing compared to Carrey's over the top acting. This movie is not good, yet I still laughed - exactly because Carrey's acting is so over the top from beginning to end, which means every 10 minutes or so some of his overacting will inevitably make you laugh. In fact, Carrey's overacting is the very reason why you should watch this movie, because it really is amazing!",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Cute message movie with Jim Carrey,"Liar Liar is one solution to the problem of what kind of movie vehicle to write for overacting, rubber man Jim Carrey. Following the success of Ace Ventura, director Tom Shaydac casts Carrey as a divorced lawyer who has no time for his young son. In the film, the word liar is a pun on lawyer, equating the two words since his character is a lying lawyer. Every time he promises to attend one of his son's school events or play with him, Carrey finds some excuse to get out of it. His son makes a birthday wish that just for one day his dad would tell the truth and it happens. Carrey is incapable of lying and when he tries to lie, his face and body go into every contortion imaginable as he tries to suppress the truth. There is a literally ""off the wall"" scene where he beats himself up in a bathroom. Carrey is a likable guy and carries the movie. Of course, you can't believe for a second that he's a lawyer but belief is not needed in this film. This is a movie with a message that fathers shouldn't ignore their children. For a film aimed at kids, there is a surprising amount of boob and sexual humor. Maura Tierney is very cute as his ex-wife. Amanda Donohoe plays Carrey's seductress law partner and Jennifer Tilly is a buxom, bimbo client. Director Tom Shadyac later worked with Carrey in Bruce Almighty. Liar Liar is for Jim Carrey fans and fathers who ignore their kids.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

Jim Carrey's best film!,"Liar Liar is in my top 3 favorite comedies of all time and my favorite Jim Carrey flick! He was just so awesome and hilarious in Liar Liar! Not only did he do mental comedy, but physical comedy that will make your stomach hurt from laughing so much! I'm not kidding when I say that I know a dozen people where we just rehearse the lines from Liar Liar back and forth, because all the scenes are just so memorable.Fletcher Reed is a lawyer who, surprise, lies to win cases. He's a huge success and is about to be made partner by his firm if he wins one last case for Mrs. Cole, a divorcée who cheated on her husband with tons of proof against her, Fletcher has to prove that she was a victim of circumstance. Fletcher has a son and an ex wife as well, he lies to them all the time as well and makes excuses why he can't spend enough time with his son, Max. When he lies and cancels going to Max's birthday party to sleep with his boss to get ahead, Max is terribly disappointed and hurt, so he makes one birthday wish, that his father cannot lie... guess what? It works!Fletcher wakes up and tells his boss she was not the best he had, leading to an encounter with a hottie in the elevator and making offensive comments about her ""jugs"". He passes a homeless man and tells him why he doesn't give change to ""the decay of western society!"" and goes to court not very ready to fight his case that could make or break his career since he can't lie. More comedy ensues as Fletcher deals with the pressure on how to learn to tell the truth to win the case and prevent his son and ex wife from moving to Boston with her new boyfriend.Liar Liar will make your sides hurt and you'll watch this movie again and again when you see how hilarious Jim Carrey is. My sister isn't a Jim Carrey fan and even admitted that she had more than a few good laughs watching this film. Not to mention that it has a great feel good ending that you'll just fall for.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

One of Carrey's best!,"The premise is simple. A heartbroken and often disappointed 5 year old boy makes a birth day wish that his father, a prominent and up-and-coming civil attorney, cannot lie for just one day.In this vehicle, through obvious wish magick, the wish is granted.In pique form of Jim Carrey's classic Dick Van Dyke-meets-Jerry Lewis style, the results of his son's wish wreaks total havoc on his life, and on the lives of those around him.With an all-star cast, fine direction, and expert screen writers, this production is top notch, classic Jim Carrey fare. IMHO, this is his best performance yet.There is not one millimeter of wasted film to this work.

Above-average Carrey comedy...,"Rubbery actor Jim Carrey, after a brief dramatic respite, returns to slapstick nonsense with this above-average comedic vehicle. He plays a constantly lying lawyer and divorced dad who, via a wish from his slighted son, is forced to tell nothing but the truth for an entire day. Film has a very bright beginning, acceptable middle, but it falls apart at the finish line. Thankfully, the syrupy uplift is kept to a minimum up until that misjudged last act. Good supporting cast includes Jennifer Tilly, Swoosie Kurtz and Cheri Oteri. Carey Elwes, again parlaying his handsomeness into smarmy territory, offers nothing fresh, but Carrey mugs cheerfully throughout and makes the most of these sitcom-like set-ups, which are funny if somewhat shopworn. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Fairly solid comedy,"Liar Liar follows Jim Carrey as a hot shot attorney who is constantly letting down his son. So when his son makes a birthday wish meaning that his dad can't lie, various high jinks follow.It is a nice idea and does lead to some good laughs, but it is stretched too thin really for a full film. By the end things just felt like they were getting a bit repetitive and I started to get a tad bored. The plot was all entirely predictable anyway which didn't ease the boredom at all. Still, it is a good idea and they do extract some decent comedy out of the scenario.One of the biggest drawbacks for me is Jim Carrey at the heart of it all. I appreciate that he is a great comic actor but I do find him quite tiring.

If Carrey is your man? This is a laugh festival.,"Flethcher Reade {Jim Carrey} is a sharp tongued attorney for whom lying has become second nature. When his son Max finally gets fed up of Fletcher breaking his promises to him, he makes a birthday wish that his dad can't lie for 24 hours. This creates monumental problems for Fletcher at work, especially as he has a big case in court today.A delightful premise is executed with boundless energy by Carrey, who clearly revels in the chance to show his flair for berserker visual comedy. Some may say over acting, others will say comic genius, either way there is no getting away from the fact that Carrey's brand of high energy, rubber faced comedy is marketable box office product. There has been an annoying trend in some of his movies where his antics have just engulfed the film, leaving no room for anything, or anyone else, to breathe. That's not the case here tho. The family arc is well treated, and well acted by Justin Cooper & Maura Tierney as Fletcher's son & ex-wife respectively. While the lawyer/court room based story provides plenty of scope that is utilised to get its messages over. It's all silly nonsense of course, but even as the film drifts into treacle pudding territory, the laughs continue to outweigh the moments of froth. Be sure to stay for the outtakes during the closing credits; joyous. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Definitely among Carrey's best work.,"Jim Carrey's best work starts with the story ideas that,when seen on paper,make you laugh.The whole idea of a lawyer who is unable to lie is indeed a funny one.I remember Carrey himself,in an interview plugging the film,said that he was drawn to the film based on that very idea.Couple that with Jim Carrey's great comedic abilities and you have a film worth watching.There are others,it should be noted,that worked just as hard to make the film funny as Carrey did,most notably Swoosie Kurtz and Carey Elwes.When ranking Jim Carrey's films from best to worst,no two people will rank the films in the same order,but I think it is safe to say that Liar Liar will end up in the upper tier of everyone's,or at least most people's list.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Heartfelt,"The story involves a lawyer who has a family but spends most of his time working, he also lies often to his son, however until his sons birthday wish which he wished for him to not lie for one day, the wish worked and the lawyer tries to lie out of his situation but simply can't.Jim Carrie once again provides great comedic moments but also a subtle drama, the story gives a warmth and innocence with comedy. Granted it may seem harsh to see a child be lied to its a lesson to a father who doesn't realize the harm he's caused and now he has to learn to tell the truth with this ""no lying"" device on him in order to re establish connection with his son. It's a charming film and touches a softer side of Jim's work.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
just there,"Jim Carrey does have a gift for slapstick comedy, making you laugh all the way to the bank, this is the second of the three movies that Tom Shadyac and Jim Carrey made together and to me it is also my second favorite after Bruce Almighty but before Ace Ventura.The thing for me is that Liar Lair, didn't strike as a very funny movie, after a while the slapstick humor become more annoying than it was entertaining. The storyline which has a sticking resemblance to a Twilight series episode which will be easy to catch by twilight fans, had the tale of not being able to lie for just 24 hours, while the Twilight series episode was about the protagonist not being able to lie as long as he owned a car or something.The movie plot is about a chronic liar and divorcée who has wrecked his home with his insensitivity, and his carelessness. With only one thing that is true in his life Fletcher (Jim Carrey) was still finding it hard to meet up to expectations as his constant lying was costing him his relationship with his son Max (Justin Cooper).After Fletcher blew off his son's birthday party to have sex with his co-worker (lying that he had to work) Max decided to make a wish that his father will not be able to lie for a whole 24 hours.Now Fletcher is a lawyer, who has a multi-million dollar case that he is on at the moment, a case all built on lies and he is finding it difficult to keep at it, since he can't lie nor ask a question knowing full well that the answer is a lie.Well Liar Liar found a way to make a man who is insensitive and not caring find a way to have a happy ending, and all he did to learn his lesson was winning a case with some honest deductions, and chasing his son on a hijacked mobile stairway in an airport which landed him on a stretcher.Like all other Tom and Carrey movies it was a box office hit, recouping its production cost and more. This is not my favorite Carrey movie and as I have said not my favorite of his duo with Tom Shadyac but Liar Liar has its moments. So if you are jumping on the wagon of a Carrey DVD collection; you may want to consider this one, but mind you to me it is just there.www.lagsreviews.com",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Moderately inventive comedy,"Jim Carrey plays a dirty Lawyer and a workaholic, who cares more about elevating his position and earning more money. It's an interesting premise and Carrey plays it really well.The plot is creative and I loved the idea of not being able to lie which set up some silly slapstick jokes which Carrey excels in.Plot-wise it's not the best and I didn't find it as funny as some of his other films, a lot of the jokes were quite repetitive and apart from Carrey in all honesty I didn't rate the acting very highly.6/10: A good, solid and inventive film. Others may enjoy it more than me",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of Jim Carrey's finest!,"Liar Liar, ladies and gents, is nothing short of hilarious! As I said in my review for How the Grinch Stole Christmas, I'm a big fan of Jim Carrey, and this movie is one of the best he's ever starred in!First of all, the story is super funny, and at times, even heartwarming. Crooked attorney Fletcher Reed (played by Jim Carrey) is an ace when it comes to winning court cases for people who are guilty of all charges. But there's a problem; his excessive focus on his career and dishonesty about everything have damaged his relationships with his wife Audrey (Maura Tierney) and his son Max (Justin Cooper). Audrey's left Fletcher to date the more dependable Jerry (Cary Elwes), and he constantly breaks the promises that he makes Max. On his 5th birthday, Max, disappointed that Fletcher once again backed out of coming to his birthday party at the last minute, wishes that his dad would be 100% honest for just 24 hours, and crazy though it may seem, it actually comes true; Fletcher immediately discovers, through some truly hilarious mishaps, that he's physically incapable of telling a single spoken OR written lie... on the very day that his career-deciding court case, the divorce of the cheating, gold-digging Samantha Cole (Jennifer Tilly), who he's representing, must be won!And if you think this premise all by itself sounds hilarious as a mere concept, wait till you get to the script! Every minute of Liar Liar is a thing of beauty. Liar Liar just never once fails to make me laugh! Key instances include the the embarrassing predicaments that Fletcher gets into when he can't lie, his secretary Greta (Anne Haney) quitting, and the scene of him roasting the committee. And who could forget the scene of him beating himself up in the bathroom? In addition, the scenes between Fletcher and Max, and Fletcher realizing his mistakes, are real heartwarming. Although it's sort of a nitpicky thing, but the movie depicts people winning cases they didn't deserve to win, through means that would NEVER be possible in real life.The acting in this movie is absolutely first-class. Jim Carrey, as always, absolutely THROWS himself into the role of Fletcher, and completely owns every second he appears onscreen. Only he could match Robin Williams in that category! Maura Tierney is perfect as Audrey. Justin Cooper is very fittingly innocent as Max. Even Cary Elwes is fantastic as Jerry, giving him a very convincing American accent and a kind, polite personality.And then the music: the theme that James Newton Howard composed for this movie is truly fantastic. It's very whimsical and adds to the comedy of this movie. The rest of the score is by John Debney, and he did a terrific job. His score really plays up the comedy of every funny scene, and even plays up the sadness of every plaintive scene. Just the way a good film score should!Everything considered, Liar Liar is a truly hilarious movie, and easily one of the best Jim Carrey has ever starred in. If you're a Jim Carrey fan, this movie is a must-see!!!And one more thing... ""STOP BREAKING THE LAW, A**HOOOOOLE!!!!!!!!!!!!""",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""My dad is a liar""","Good old Jim Carry at his peak carrying a movie that had a pretty out there premise.

Boring,"I think Swoosie Kurz sums it up nicely in the bloopers: OVERACTOR.There's nothing in this film except Carrey doing his over-the-top routine in front of a camera. He's talented, but it's just silly and at times even embarrassing. It seems as if the script was ""let's have a basic plot outline, and then have Carrey do whatever he wants in front of the camera for about 80 minutes. And that's a wrap"". This isn't comedy, there's nothing funny or entertaining about it, and even as slapstick it doesn't hold up. In his own words, had ""somebody stopped him"", the film would have benefited greatly. As it is, it is just boring, which is a shame.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The truth shall set you free---yeah, tell me about it!","Not since Cary Grant mugged outrageously throughout 'Arsenic and Old Lace' has another actor accomplished what Jim Carrey does here.  In one of his more plausible, more restrained comedy roles--(restrained???--well for Carrey anyway)--he does wonders with voice, looks, expressions and double takes. The storyline is a slim one--can a lawyer who tells lies (seemingly for a living) tell the truth for 24 hours? It's a cute premise and is given its full potential thanks to a witty script and the right actor in the lead. Nobody else in the cast registers strongly because it's pretty much a one man show. Carrey delivers a knockout performance.It never pretends to be anything more than a lighthearted comedy--and it succeeds merrily. By all means, give it a whirl.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Short, Funny and Heartwarming Movie","This movie is about a lawyer Fletcher(Jim Carrey) who has made a career out of lying and neglecting spending time with his son for work.One day he misses his son's birthday which causes his son Max to make a birthday wish that comes true, but could ruin Fletcher's career or make him change his ways.Liar Liar was funnier and more heartwarming than I anticipated.Jim Carrey puts on a performance only he can pull off, from all the funny faces to the voices he does and the way he can distort his face, no one can do it like Jim. If you're looking for a not so long movie, but an entertaining one with a great message this is a great choice. I don't know if I'll ever go back and watch this movie again, but I enjoyed it for the one time I did watch it. Jim Carrey is an amazing actor and he doesn't disappoint in Liar Liar.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Carrey in his prime.,"In his prime, Carrey acted in some of the funniest movies made. This one ranks right up there with the very best. His actions and reactions will keep you laughing from scene to scene. On top of that, the plot is really quite delightful... a young boy, who adores his non-custodial dad, makes a birthday wish that his dad will no longer be able to tell a lie... something dad has done to his son with unkept promises over and over again. When the wish is granted, mayhem ensues, especially for a dad who is also a lawyer facing a case where the truth needs to be stretched a bit.

"""Write it! Write it, or I'll break it off!""","Even though this is my first Jim Carrey film, I already feel like most of his performances are like this one, and while some might've worked, been more excusable, or less irritable somehow, this one has made me tired of it already. His acting style, or rather his insistence on always doing this kind of acting, is so particular (and not necessarily in a good way, most of the time, I'd imagine) that you're fatigued after only your first exposure, instead of after repeated exposure.But as I've said, maybe it has worked in other films, like Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. I don't know why I thought of that one. It didn't seem to work in this film; he was already doing his thing, acting unharmfully deranged (to a lesser extent) before ""getting into it."" And even then, you have to go along with it; being unable to lie doesn't justify/explain his behavior/Jim Carrey's acting style: it's too far-fetched and overly dramatic. At the same time, I'm not sure if it's more bearable even when it did work. I'm not sure what that would even entail; what would make his acting style work? If he's ever acted seriously, I bet that's much better.Of course, all that isn't to say he's a subpar actor, quite the opposite. His go-to way of acting deserves appreciation. I doubt any of his antics are easy to do, or maybe it is for him, but you can tell he should receive praise for how well he does them. The only problem is that it wears you down efficiently, making you want to cleanse yourself by watching something else and wishing there was variation.I thought the comedy was subpar, but that doesn't necessarily mean objectively. It could simply be a matter of not liking Jim Carrey's comedy. In this film, at least. He did add some distinction, though. I will say that, based on this film and Vampire's Kiss, both my first films of Nicolas Cage and Jim Carrey, I'd rather watch Nic do his thing. In cases where either one carries the film, Nic does it better. Watching Nic lose his mind is more enjoyable than Jim making you lose your mind.The best part of this film was the bloopers at the end, which to no surprise, was funnier than the film. There were some moments besides the bloopers that were somewhat funny, but the bloopers were way better. And one other thing that made this film ""worth it"" was the hotness of Amanda Donohoe, Maura Tierney, Jennifer Tilly, and Krista Allen, who looked like Angela White. Yeah, that's 100% shallow, but it's true.To sum it up, this film was a bit of a letdown. It was a short film, and even then, it felt too long. Jim Carrey, while a good actor, is tiring. He seemed to negatively impact this film to where short isn't short enough. But, as I said, some moments were somewhat funny, moments that weren't the bloopers, so his negative impact wasn't necessarily that negative; you just get overwhelmed and need a break.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Lies Lies Lies. Yeah.,"Oh Jim. We don't deserve you.I haven't seen this in years. When I was a kid, I love Jim Carrey movies. Pretty much all of them. You put his rubberfaced antics on screen and I'm glued for the full duration. Growing up though, I haven't seen most of these in ages and I was worried that my ""adult"" eyes would look at his work and think it was just madcap displays with no substance and I could not be happier to be wrong. Sharp dialogue and incredible performances feel like a given but there's also so much heart in this and it shows these great hints at what a solid overall actor Carrey is. The moments where he realize what a failure he is as a father are just devastating and hit just as hard as his hilarious attempts to determine the color of his pen.The only knock I have on it comes with the ending and the complete and utter lack of consequences for the actions of the movie. I get it. It's a family based comedy and they don't want it to end with this dude in some prison infirmary but for everything that happens I would like to see some of it matter. It is such a minor thing though, like 2 minutes at the end of an incredible movie so I'm not that mad at it. There's also some things in this that are not so socially acceptable anymore but I don't hold that against it, it's a product of it's time.Absolutely recommend though. If you've never seen it or haven't seen it in a while, do yourself the favor of popping this on and strap in for a riotous good time that may just sneak a few hits to the feels in the process.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Carrey forth the hilarious news,"Doing his usual stuff, Jim Carrey plays a dishonest lawyer ignoring his son. When the son wishes for Carrey to speak only the truth for an entire day, Carrey spends the next day making every off-the-wall comment imaginable, and getting his face into weird contortions. It's hard to determine which is the funniest scene, just because of some of the things that he does, but the bathroom beating is really great.All in all, this can be interpreted as a reminder of the importance of family, but it's mostly an excuse to have fun. You just have to try and imagine being in his presence when he says and does these sorts of things. Really funny. Also starring Maura Tierney, Cary Elwes and Jennifer Tilly.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Bubble Paper,"This is a remake of a 1941 Bob Hope film ""Nothing But the Truth,"" done by the producer and director of the remake of ""The Nutty Professor."" Though the scripts are very different from the originals, the general plots and developments are similar. Whether you love ""Liar Liar"" or hate it depends on your feelings toward Jim Carrey, because it's basically a Jim Carrey movie. There are a few comic gems thrown in from time to time, especially by the motor pool guy and by Jason Bernard as the judge. The two funniest routines are the cop pull over and the hilarious scene when Carrey beats himself silly in the men's room of the court house in a vain attempt to get a postponement until he is able to lie once more. A befuddled elderly gent walks in just as Carrey begins to ram his head against the wall. His double takes are as funny as Carrey's self flagellation. When he finally inquires as to what is going on Carrey flippantly replies, ""I'm kicking my ass."" Realizing this must be a mad man, the elderly gent takes off like lightning.Carrey's ability to distort his facial and physical features is uncanny. In this ability he is similar in many ways to the great Jerry Lewis. Lewis' humor, however, was generally, though not always, on a much higher intellectual plain than is Carrey's. Carrey's histrionics are at times outrageously funny when they work and embarrassingly silly when he goes over the top. His humor is very unpredictable. There can be no doubt that he has a knack for far out comedy. Of all the Jim Carrey movies I have seen, ""Liar Liar"" pleased me the most. I found myself laughing aloud from time to time. The elevator bit with the woman with big boobs is excruciatingly funny. On the other hand, the final comic episode of the movie when Carey jacks equipment so he can catch the plane taking off on the runway is so far fetched that even his wild antics cannot salvage the scene.If you're a Carrey fan, you'll die laughing. If you're not a Carrey fan, you may still find this outing funny.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Nothing but the (funny) truth,"How to describe this? If you know Jim Carrey, if you have seen movies of him (the comedies that is), you know what he is capable of.

Add to that a stellar cast of people who play it straight (which is hard enough considering the things he is doing to them, evident in the outtakes during the end credits) - to maximize the comedy and his jokes.Having to tell the truth and not being able to lie - what a high end concept. But one that works wonders with Jim Carrey at the helm.

Could The Movie Have Worked If It Weren't For Jim Carrey?,"My mother, my late aunt, and I picked up this movie because we thought it was going to be good. The concept might have worked, but the problem was that Jim Carrey spoiled everything by his extreme facial mugging. We compared him to Jerry Lewis, whom he was trying to imitate, but even Lewis never twisted his face around so much like Carrey kept doing in this movie. After a half hour, we got sick of it and unloaded the video.It's a high-concept idea, and perhaps could have worked if some other actor had done the job. If instead of twisting his face around to an extreme when he couldn't give a false answer to a question in a courtroom, the lawyer might have used a more subtle way of showing he couldn't talk, the movie might have had some laughs. But this movie had me choose to avoid any movies with Jim Carrey in it if possible. And that was the lesson I took from ""Liar Liar"".",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Great Film with a Good Moral,"""Liar Liar,"" directed by Tom Shadyac and starring Jim Carrey, is a comedy gem that showcases Carrey at his absolute best. Released in 1997, this film has earned its place as a classic, blending laugh-out-loud moments with a heartfelt story that still resonates today.The plot centers around Fletcher Reede (Jim Carrey), a lawyer who thrives on bending the truth. However, his constant lying has taken a toll on his personal life, especially with his son Max (Justin Cooper). Everything changes when Max makes a birthday wish that his dad can't tell a lie for 24 hours. When the wish magically comes true, Fletcher's life spirals into a hilarious chaos as he grapples with the truth in every situation.Jim Carrey's performance is the heart of ""Liar Liar."" His boundless energy, wild expressions, and physical comedy are simply unmatched. Whether he's attempting to tell a lie and failing miserably or dealing with the fallout of his brutal honesty, Carrey is a joy to watch. His comedic timing is impeccable, making every scene memorable.The supporting cast is fantastic too. Maura Tierney plays Fletcher's ex-wife Audrey with warmth and sincerity, while Cary Elwes as her new boyfriend Jerry brings a charming goofiness to the role. Justin Cooper is adorable as Max, perfectly capturing the innocence and hope of a child who just wants his dad to be honest.The script by Paul Guay and Stephen Mazur is sharp and witty, balancing the slapstick humor with touching moments that give the film its heart. The theme of honesty and integrity is woven throughout the story, adding depth without ever feeling preachy.Director Tom Shadyac keeps the pace brisk, ensuring there's never a dull moment. The courtroom scenes, in particular, are highlights, showcasing Fletcher's internal struggle and Carrey's comedic brilliance.Visually, the film is bright and vibrant, matching its upbeat tone. John Debney's score complements the film perfectly, enhancing both the funny and emotional moments.""Liar Liar"" is more than just a showcase for Jim Carrey's comedy genius; it's a well-rounded film with a touching message about personal growth and the importance of truth. It's a beloved classic that's still as funny and heartwarming as it was when it first came out. Whether you're watching it again or for the first time, ""Liar Liar"" guarantees a great time.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Pretty Funny Movie,"Not all comedies manage to get a laugh out of me. This one did - several times - so I have to rate it as a success. I'm not a huge fan of Jim Carrey, and what I don't like about him was evident in abundance here. It was actually summed up by castmate Swoosie Kurtz in the last of the closing out-takes when, while filming one of their courtroom scenes, she turns to him (in a scene where she makes an objection) and shouts ""Over-Actor!"" Yeah. That sums it up, and Carrey responds with the words ""They're on to me!"" Give him credit - at least he can poke fun at himself! Having said that, his over-acting is distracting and detracts from both the movie and the credibility of his character. Questioning the honesty and ethics of lawyers may be everyone's favourite sport, but Carrey's portrayal of lawyer Fletcher Reede was just too over the top to be believable.And yet, this still works - it's a pretty funny movie. Fletcher builds his law career and his life on lying - to everyone (hence, the play on words: liar/lawyer) including his ex wife (which is probably why she's his ""ex"" wife) and his young son, whom he regularly hurts by promising to visit and then making excuses to get out of it. His lies make him a success in the courtroom though and he's on the verge of making partner at his firm when his son makes a wish while blowing out his birthday candles - that for one day, dad wouldn't be able to lie. The wish comes true and the result is chaos. I suppose there's three basic points being made: first, if we all told the truth about everything it would cause a lot of trouble (think of Fletcher speaking to the woman he's never met on the elevator and telling her how much he likes her rather significant ""endowment"") and a lot of hurt even to the people we truly care about; second, if we were to lie about everything it would also cause a lot of trouble ; and, finally, don't ignore your kids - they're precious and they need our attention.It's a funny movie with a message. If you can deal with Carrey's over- acting, it's worth watching. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Superb comedy that still makes me laugh out loud,"I have loved Liar Liar for decades. It came out when Jim Carrey was still at the top of his game, and was a massive box office draw. While goofy things like Ace Ventura and The Mask made him popular, I think that this film is the ultimate example of what he can do as an actor. This movie allows him to have those unhinged moments, but gives an explanation for his insanity that makes it feel relatable instead of idiotic. I love the more heartfelt moments that he includes in the movie as well. He never feels like he's faking it when he's with his son and ex-wife, despite the fact that a few scenes earlier he was flopping around on the ground simply because he couldn't say the color of his pen. The film has a charm that makes it feel authentic even though the premise is crazy, and most of the sane characters would try to have him committed if this were the real world.One of the things I appreciate most in Liar Liar is that it is one of the rare films about a workaholic father that actually makes you feel like he is in the wrong. Typically these movies make it seem like the father is bad simply because he's dedicated to his work and doesn't want to sit at home all day playing with his children (as if work and income are instantly evil.) But in Liar Liar we see a father who is genuinely neglectful, who can't keep his promises to his son, and who will completely blow him off for lousy reasons. It makes the transformation by the end more satisfying and is one of the rare times where ""maybe I should quit and start my own firm"" actually feels like a good solution. It also helps to have Cary Elwes in the film as the stark contrast because he is the type of father-figure young Max could use.However, I am able to recognize that Liar Liar isn't a perfect movie. There are many things that go on which would never be accepted in an actual courtroom, or even in an ordinary office. You have to accept that in some ways this is all taking place in a heightened reality separate from our own so that a man can rant and rave without serious repercussions. The tone of the film can also get a little saccharine at times. It's funny, because Cary Elwes' character is mocked for being too square and cheesy, but the movie falls into the same trap at times. Also, Justin Cooper was not a good child actor. There are some important story points handled by this kid, and he is on par with Jake Lloyd in the Phantom Menace. But I am immune to noticing these flaws when I watch Liar Liar, because I'm too busy laughing at it all. This movie never fails to put a big goofy smile on my face.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Funny, but it did get overly sentimental at times too.","This film came after the poorly received Jim Carrey film ""Cable Guy"". While I do say this one was better than that one, it was not really all that much better. It was funny watching an attorney that could not lie and the bizarre things he had to do at times to try and get around it and win the case, but it was also a bore watching him with his son and realizing how bad a father he was. It was also just embarrassing to watch him do that claw thing. The film is about a man who has not been the best father in the world and has a habit of breaking his promises. So his son decides to make a wish on his birthday that his father not be capable of lying and strangely it comes true. Funny scenes abound like his awkward elevator encounter, his courtroom antics and a very funny scene where he beats the crap out of himself. The film is just about all Jim Carrey as the only other character that made an impact is Jennifer Tilly as a very nasty woman who is suing for custody of her children and trying to get all the money she can from her husband. Still, Jim Carrey is pretty much on fire for most of the film and he had enough energy to carry this film at this time. I realize you had to have a reason for him to be incapable of lying, I just did not really care for the son and the family parts of the movie. Just a matter of personal taste.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the better Carrey movies...,"This movie does have the trademark Jim Carrey comedy, but thankfully the rubber facial contortions were held to a minimum, which actually serve the movie quite well.Story-wise then ""Liar Liar"" is one of the better of Jim Carrey movies, because there is a deeper story to be told here, unlike many other of his movies which was essentially just physical comedy. The story in ""Liar Liar"" is about Fletcher Reede, a successful, fast-talking lawyer who spends more time at work than with his five year old son who is desperate for his father's attention. With one disappointment after the other, the son makes a desperate birthday wish; that his father will be unable to lie for 24 hours.The comedy was good, and the physical mimicry that is usually Associated with Jim Carrey was held to a minimum. And the cast ensemble was doing good jobs with their given roles, even though Jim Carrey cast a massive shadow over everyone else.I think that ""Liar Liar"" was a milestone and a turning point from the usual Jim Carrey routine and mass-produced physical comedy movies he is known for. Predictable, yes, but the movie is fun and entertaining nonetheless.""Liar Liar"" is a definite must watch if you enjoy a good comedy, or if you just enjoy Jim Carrey movies.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
7.0/10 - Just a fun little comedy with a cool concept,"That one's gonna be a quick one, cause it's a simple movie and there isn't a lot to say about it.Liar Liar is a fun Comedy with Jim Carrey (which obviously makes it so charming at times, so goofy at others and both of them most of the time.), and it has a pretty simpel premise. Jim Carrey plays Fletcher, an attorney who lies to everyone - lies to his mom, lies to his son and basically lies for living. On his son's birthday, his son, Max, makes a wish - he wishes that his father won't be able to lie for one day only. So yeah, a nice little concept right there.I'll tell you right off, it's not gonna blow your mind. The film is quite predictable, it has a lot of cliche moments and tons of tearjerkers that don't work out that well, imo.But even so, this film is just fun to watch. The acting is solid, the characters are mostly memorable, most of the jokes are legitimately funny. The pacing is also quite good, and I think that this movie keeps you engaged, even though you kinda know what's about to happen, generally, most of the time.So, yeah. Liar Liar is a fun little comedy , and I had a good time watching it. It's a movie to watch with someone who likes this kind of humor and just have a good time for a while without thinking too much. I give this a solid 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good comedy,"Good comedy. Fletcher wakes up and tells his boss she was not the best he had, leading to an encounter with a hottie in the elevator and making offensive comments about her ""jugs"". He passes a homeless man and tells him why he doesn't give change to ""the decay of western society!"" and goes to court not very ready to fight his case that could make or break his career since he can't lie. More comedy ensues as Fletcher deals with the pressure on how to learn to tell the truth to win the case and prevent his son and ex wife from moving to Boston with her new boyfriend. Liar Liar will make your sides hurt and you'll watch this movie again and again when you see how hilarious Jim Carrey is. My sister isn't a Jim Carrey fan and even admitted that she had more than a few good laughs watching this film. Not to mention that it has a great feel good ending that you'll just fall for.10/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Jim Carrey as the man who ""can't handle the lie"" ...","Ever since societies existed, lies could either be the drivers or killers of human relationships, but I guess we have to blame it on truth. The trick with the truth is that sometimes we want to tell it but not to hear it, or vice versa. Do we really want to know what is said about us at the third person? Truth is a social double-edged sword, and lying a psychic boomerang, hitting you in the face when you don't expect it.This is why the main premise of a film like ""Liar, Liar"" where a man endures the curse of not lying, worse: not being able to articulate one lousy syllabic that wouldn't tell the truth is not only hilarious, but intellectually challenging, as it incites us to question the place 'lying', occupies in our lives and daily agendas... and occasionally on America's judiciary system. Indeed, maybe the fact that the story focuses on a slick lawyer in Los Angeles, a sort of Lionel Hutz in flesh and blood and competence, asks a bit too much on the suspension of disbelief department, still what a premise, the kind that probably started with a simple ""what if"" question and one wondered how no one ever got this idea before.It seems so clever, yet so simple, but it's not a laugh-riot guarantee either, my guess is that it's the kind of plot premises that can only work if you have the comical performance to efficiently conduct it from paper to screens. Think about that, ""a man can't lie"", so what, what is funny? The fact that he can't lie can easily become redundant; it's all in the diversity of reactions then. And who's better than Jim Carrey to takes you by surprises even when you expect to laugh? Only Carrey could have been so hilariously, pathetically, frantically funny in his desperate attempts to let one single lie comes out of his mouth, especially the day of a very tough divorce and child custody trial.Jim Carrey delivers his funniest performance, and certainly one of the funniest of the 90's, Adam Sandler? Chris Farley? ""Liar, Liar"" is the ultimate proof that Carrey is the real thing when it comes to comedy. Carrey's face is a gift from Cinematic Gods, hell, you don't even need CGI, it's like every parcel of his face is capable of displaying more hilarious elasticity than all the comics of his generation combined in all of their films. ""Liar, Liar"" is 80 minutes of demonstration, of Carrey's talent and comical superiority. Naturally, it's not just all about grimaces, funny faces or scream, like the best comedies, ""Liar, Liar"" has a heart and maintains an overwhelming everyday feeling, we're enjoying Carrey's talent, but still, we think of our own lives or lies.Marking the return of Jim Carrey after the film 'that almost ruined his career' according to Homer Simpson, ""Liar, Liar"" is the second collaboration with Tom Shadyak after ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"" in 1994, the breakthrough year where he starred in 3 movies from the Box- office Top 10. He made it again with ""Liar, Liar"", for all the zaniness, Jim Carrey played a more mature, and identifiable character through Fletcher Reed, half liar, half lawyer (a clever opening joke probably lost in translation in all the foreign versions). While it does flirt a little bit with the too-busy-to-see-his-son father cliché, it avoids it by focusing on lying, this is Fletcher's problem, he can't see his child because he just built his whole life, professional, social and familial, on lying.And when the kid gets one lie too much, he blows the candle of his birthday cake and makes the wish that his father can't lie during 24 hours, the curse applies immediately with the hilarious sex aftermath comment followed by the unforgettable drool-inducing elevator scene. Indeed, this scene speaks for all the men who tried to maintain eye-control in front of a nice pair of juicy  well, that's our mind whispering to us, and Fletcher's nightmare is that it's his mind controlling his words. And while transposing his case to my personal life, I wondered to what extent my life would have been different if I had one day without lying. I even shudder thinking to the eventuality of my wife asking me some questions about my past. Of course, it's just a film, but still.So, as soon as the curse operates, the movie takes off for a magnificent, flamboyant bravura performance from Jim Carrey, one gag after another, making the little archetypes, from the cute Justin Cooper with the worst haircut ever to Maura Tierney, the comprehensive divorced wife who still has feelings toward her ex-husband and the dull and boring replacer, Cary Elwes doing well in a rather ungrateful role, not to mention the scene-stealing Jennifer Tilly as the slutty ambitious unfaithful wife, they all become insignificant, because it's Carrey's film. And Carrey carries it with the power of his face, and a terrific script, one that visits every kind of situation where the 'to lie or not to lie' dilemma plays a pivotal role, even one that allows Fletcher to relieve himself by roasting everyone during an unforgettable board meeting, literally the film's laugh-out-loudest moment.And we catch our breath during some genuine moments of true father- and-son tenderness showcasing an unknown capability for seriousness, something the previous movies didn't show. And ""Liar, Liar"" probably played a vital and pivotal role in Carrey's career, proving he was at ease with slapstick humor (damn, I can't get the face he had with the luggage thing stuck in his face) and emotions too, a versatility that would be confirmed in ""The Truman Show"" one year later.And ""Liar, Liar"" concludes with a nice moral, if you build your life on lies, it might collapse sooner or later, if did for Fletcher, but the essential remained, and he would finally value it.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Tell no lies,"A film of my childhood. I watched it 30 times, if not more. And imagine, I'm still not tired of it. It's like good wine, every year it acquires more taste and in comparison with modern comedy movies - it's just a classic!The story is about a prosperous lawyer, Fletcher Reed, who, thanks to his brilliant lies, won many cases. But he lied to such an extent that his wife left him and went to someone else, and his own son no longer understood when he was lying and when he was telling the truth. And after the unlucky dad did not come to his son for his birthday, he made a wish that his father would not lie for at least one day. And, oddly enough, the wish comes true! And now, Reed has to always stick to the truth for 24 hours.Jim Carrey was great.

So 90s it hurts,"Ive always liked Jim Carey, but somehow missed this movie in the 90s. Watching in 2022 may have given me a different opinion. There were some funny gags and a decent story and message but overall I just found Careys insane manic behavior doesnt work as a regular person in the dramatic 90s world they built here, he works better as characters who are animated to begin with like Ace Ventura, The Mask and The Riddler. He was playing over the top right from the start of this movie where Im meant to believe he is a serious high end lawyer. Maybe it would have worked better for me if there was a change in behavior after Max makes his wish, but as it stands I think people who arent familiar with Carey will be turned off.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Jim Carrey returns to the realm of high concept light hearted farce in a solidly acted and directed vehicle,"Fletcher Reede (Jim Carrey is a successful lawyer at a large firm who although he experiences great success in his career, he has not experienced the same success with his family as he is divorced from his wife Audrey (Maura Tierney) and routinely disappoints his son Max (Justin Cooper) due to Fletcher's constant prioritization of his job and career advancement which Fletcher achieves through his ability to lie with ease. Following Fletcher missing Max's birthday despite promising otherwise, Max makes a wish (starting at 8:15pm) on his candles that Fletcher cannot lie for one entire day. Fletcher's life is thrown into chaos as without his effortless ability to lie he learns how precarious his situation truly is as he offends colleagues and unwillingly reveals secrets and shames he would've otherwise covered up. To make matters worse, Fletcher has agreed to be representation for shameless unfaithful gold-digger Samantha Cole (Jennifer Tilly) in a high profile divorce case that will make or break Fletcher's career as Audrey contemplates moving to Boston with Max to be with her fiancée Jerry (Cary Elwes).Liar Liar is a 1997 comedy film starring Jim Carrey that was something of a comeback for Carrey after (many) audiences and critics rejected Carrey's darker departure with 1996's The Cable Guy which while not a bomb as many erroneously remember as it still made $100 million worldwide. The script written by Paul Guay and Stephen Mazur was originally written as a potential vehicle for Steve Martin as an unscrupulous real estate agent until the script came to Universal where Judd Apatow rewrote the script for a younger actor to play a lawyer. Mike Myers was offered the lead, but turned it down to star in Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, while Carrey who had turned down Austin Powers agreed to Liar Liar on the condition that Carrey's friend and collaborator on Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, Tom Shadyac, helm the film. The film was met with critical and audience acclaim with the film becoming the 7th highest-grossing film of that year making $300 million against its $45 million budget. Liar Liar doesn't reinvent the wheel when it comes to 90s high concept comedies, but it features Carrey firing on all cylinders doing what he does best.The movie is unmistakably a 90s era comedy with the familiar setup of divorced/ strained father, whimsical soundtrack, and broad familial drama seen in other notable comic vehicles of the era. While the style was well ingrained at this point in the 90s, Liar Liar has a clever enough concept that it's able to forgive most of the tropes it dives into. Liar Liar does a good job of analyzing the various little lies we say throughout the day to avoid embarrassment, shame, or loss of standing and when you add to that Carrey's character is a lawyer whose clients' worst possible enemy is ""the truth"" it leads to some solid comic friction. The movie's cast is firing on all cylinders with Carrey's physical prowess second to none when it comes the physically demanding set pieces he puts himself through.Liar Liar isn't as ambitious as something like The Mask or The Cable Guy, but for good light hearted farcical viewing it's a solid choice.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Laugh-Out-Loud!!,"Jim Carry, an actor that redefined the comedy genre by his marvelous comic timing and wit & humor. His movies have always been a laughter riot and have left millions of people laughing their hearts out seeing the way he delivers and performs. Liar Liar is another movie which has demonstrated that Why Jim carry is one of the best comedians of our times. This is a simple story about a Lawyer Fletcher Reede (Jim Carry) who relies heavily on his lying abilities to win cases. He has a broken marriage with and a beloved son whom he loves but can't spend time with due one reason or another and lies with him. The story then takes a twist when on his birthday, due to his father's inability to reach and in the spirit of disappointment, wishes for only one day his father cannot say a goddamn lie even if he wants to lie. Now, this wish comes true and now the fun part of the movie begins. The routine situations where earlier Fletcher used to carve the way out easily by lying would straight away bluntly say the Truth. But the only problem is speaking the Truth is that it hits at the person badly which he/she is not able to digest. There are umpteen instances which makes us laugh the hearts out by seeing Jim Carry perform all those silly and hilarious scenes. A few of the Noteworthy scenes are ""When He Jostles with pen about its color"", ""The Court Room Drama – Case of Mrs Cole"" and many more. This movie makes us realize how evolved an actor is Jim Carry. This movie is a must watch for all just for a simple reason to witness the greatness of Jim Carry, how he performs even the simplest scenes and takes it to the level which has been witnessed never before. I would give this movie a 9/10. Enjoy, Laugh and breathe!!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Ironic, amusing, and kind of touching. Among Carrey's best","There are two facts which Liar Liar stresses clearly. One is optimistic and the other is rather pessimistic. In truth, most of us probably tell far more lies than we tell truths to people because it keeps us from getting slapped in the face among other things. It also points out that the most that in a capitalist society, where the family unit is never as communally linked as in other parts of the world, the most important thing to a boy (once he passes the age of Oedipus complex) is being with his father. With this in mind, Liar Liar is one of Jim Carrey's more emotionally intelligent comedies.Carrey is Flecher Reede, a sly/sharp criminal lawyer. His success comes from the fact that he is full of lies. He is away from home a lot. On the day of his son's birthday, he makes a couple of promises that he doesn't keep because he gets a good offer that evening. He misses the party. For the kid's birthday wish, he wishes that his father could only tell the truth for a day. It is going to be a very hectic day for Flecher, hopefully he can pull of the latest case he has been assigned to but can he also convince his ex wife not to leave with his son for Boston? She has a new boyfriend who has proposed to her.In the tradition of Charlie Chaplin, and Buster Keaton, Jim Carrey is the best slapstick comedian today (or he was a few years ago). He is never dull here. Although I cannot recall a time when Carrey has made me scream with laughter, this I think is one of his best performances. Unlike with the Mask, this is Carrey doing the work, not the special effect department. I doubt if I need to describe what he is capable of, Most of us know, but for those who don't this might be the best film to introduce Jim Carrey to you. Either this or Ace Ventura...and that's no lie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Way better than I thought it would be.,"Liar Liar (1997)3/4Talk about an interesting little movie - it's generic and predictable, but Jim Carrey makes it very watchable, and earns the movie its recommended three stars. This is a funny film, and I laughed a lot.The movie's plot, which is very simple, follows a lawyer (Jim Carrey) who can't lie for a full 24 hours after his son wishes it at his birthday party. As he's a court lawyer, things get pretty out of control.Carrey in this film kind of reminds me of Jerry Lewis and The Marx Brothers. Like these guys, Carrey uses insane and out of control comedy elements like being extensively ridiculous, and being completely psychotic at points. The style, which is echoed heavily throughout the film, makes it funny. But, unfortunately, the screenplay for the movie (I thought) was a little predictable and I had seen it before. That's disappointing, because the movie could have been way better. It's not a comedy classic, but it's funny how it is, and I enjoyed it just for that.

A Dishonest Lawyer Grappling with the Truth,"""Fletcher Reede"" (Jim Carrey) is an extremely good defense attorney due in large part to a conscious decision on his part to say anything to get his client off the hook. Unfortunately, this lack of honesty on his part has bled over into his family life with the result that his wife ""Audrey Reede"" (Maura Tierney) not only doesn't trust him but has divorced him as well. He does, however, have some visitation rights to see his son ""Max Reede"" (Justin Cooper) but being the self-absorbed person that he is often wastes these opportunities due to work commitments. Naturally, to absolve himself he then lies to his wife and son rather than telling them the truth. However, that all comes to a screeching halt when his young son blows out the candles on his birthday cake and wishes that for just 24 hours his father has to tell the truth. And having built his entire career on lying that becomes a nightmare for him. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an extremely uneven comedy which had some really funny scenes but also featured some serious over-acting on the part of Jim Carrey.

The main actor resorts to spasms and stuttering rather than just saying in dry words what's on his mind.This movie is too far from reality to be really funny:It's hard to recognize yourself, saying ""yes, that's life"" and then enjoy a good laugh from that.I still like the idea of the movie and hope that somebody with more style will pick up the plot and put it into more sophisticated entertainment.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I always have been and love the energy and charisma he brings to his roles, so 'Liar Liar' was always going to be entertaining for me.A film as silly and over-the-top as this would fail with just about any other actor, but these are the films that Carrey always thrives in. He's excellent once again in 'Liar Liar' and I can't fault any part of his performance - he's hilarious from start to finish.

Truth hurts,"Unable to lie as a result of a birthday wish, a lawyer who has built his career on fibs discovers how hard it is to tell the truth all the time in this Jim Carrey comedy vehicle. The premise is fairly decent with the overarching question of whether it is possible to live without lying a little. One of the film's best scenes has Carrey insulting all the partners and senior members of his law firm simply by telling the truth as he sees it, which they mistake for practical joking (why else would anyone be so insolent?). Most of the film though does not capitalise on this agenda as Carrey constantly chews the scenery, making absurd noises and weird faces as he struggles to lie. In fact, the film's funniest bit comes in the end credits blooper reel as Swoosie Kurtz calls him an ""overactor"" - though there is also a fun part in which he tells his son that not only will his face not freeze if the wind changes, but in fact some people (Carrey) make living out of making funny faces! The film does not stack up particular well to repeat viewings though since much of the plot hinges on Carrey doing the unexpected, and beyond Carrey's facial antics, the father/son angle is just schmaltzy. There is also something uncomfortable in how the film wants us to cheer for Carrey getting an adulterous client off the hook and cheer for Carrey himself, who only ever seems like an obnoxious human being. The film does have several genuinely hilarious moments though in between Carrey's mugging though and it does highlight how much society is built on white lies, but 'Liar Liar' is really a Carrey showcase all the way.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Settle down Jim,"In Liar Liar you get pretty much everything you would expect in a Jim Carrey comedy. You've got your physical humor, your screaming and shouting and, of course, you've got lots of mugging for the camera. Carrey never met a camera he couldn't make a funny face into. In some of his movies all of this Carrey being Carrey stuff works perfectly. This movie however leaves you wishing he could have dialed things down a few notches. There are moments here where the typical Carrey zaniness works. But there are more moments where Carrey's outlandishness overwhelms the story. Which is too bad because unlike some of his other movies where the outlandishness was the whole point this movie actually has a story you can really appreciate. The movie is actually rather charming but you get the sense it would have been even more so if only Carrey could have reined himself in a bit. You just wish that Carrey and director Tom Shadyac had trusted their story a little bit more and let the story carry the movie. Instead this becomes just another typical Jim Carrey movie. Not that there's anything necessarily wrong with typical Jim Carrey movies. It's just that this one had the potential to be something a little different and a little better than that.In this movie Carrey plays lawyer Fletcher Reede, a man very focused on his career. And certainly not nearly as focused as he should be on his young son Max. Fletcher is separated from Max's mom and whenever he sees his son it seems all he does is make promises he can't or won't keep. And then comes the fateful day when Max, upset that Fletcher has failed to show up for his birthday party, makes a wish that his dad could not tell a lie for an entire day. And when that wish immediately comes true the consequences for Fletcher are immediate. Having to tell the truth all the time can really get a guy into trouble. Not to mention make it rather difficult to do your job when you're a lawyer whose whole case is one giant fabrication. Hilarity ensues. All that Carrey being Carrey stuff. Some of that stuff is admittedly quite good but some of it does miss the mark. There's a great story in there about Fletcher trying to reconnect with his son but too often that story gets lost amidst all the Carrey shenanigans. Carrey overshadows everyone and everything else in the movie. Which is too bad. Yes, you know Carrey's the star of the movie. And yes, you know Carrey's going to do all the things which made him a star in the first place. But this movie called for a little less wackiness, a more grounded performance. Here Carrey had a good story and a couple of other really good performers, most notably Maura Tierney playing Fletcher's ex-wife, to work with. But he just couldn't help himself. Jim Carrey was going to be Jim Carrey, with all the contortions and overacting and relentless mugging that entails. And in the end, despite all its potential, that makes this just another Jim Carrey movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Carrey over the top performance but not too over the top,"This is Jim Carrey at his best in a over the top performance where he plays a very eccentric character but not so much that it's ridiculous like his characters in the Ace Ventura or The Mask movies. And at least his eccentric behavior is explained by him wanting to lie but not being able to do so for a 24 hour period of time.Carrey plays Fletcher Reed a lawyer who is a serial liar and is having a hard time handling the fact that for a 24 hour period of time he can't lie about anything because of a birthday wish his son made.The movie is probably right behind The Truman Show, Man in the Moon and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind as the best work of his career.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A comedy that really makes you laugh with a couple errors,"By the middle to late 1990s, Jim Carrey had solidified his presence in Hollywood history by moving from Saturday Night Live skits to major box office grabs like Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994), The Mask (1994) and Batman Forever (1995). It seemed as if Carrey was destined to always play some kind of supernatural character that had no limits as well as not being able to live on the common social level at the time. That is until he starred in this movie. For this role, it was actually a step down from the weird and crazed out parts Carey had played in the past. It is by no means as toned down as his performance he would later play in The Truman Show (1998) but at this point, it was the beginning of that transition. The story follows Fletcher Reede (Carrey), a lawyer who loves doing what he does by unethically lying to get by; that also means his family. After missing out on his son's birthday, Max (Justin Cooper) wishes that his dad couldn't lie for one whole day, which ends up coming true.The catch is, Fletcher has a huge case coming up which if he wins (by lying) he could earn the big bucks. The script written by Paul Guay, Stephen Mazur and directed by Tom Shadyac (who has worked with Carrey before) prepare and execute the story properly. Specifically the way the characters are written is a big part. The Reede family show that his son and divorced wife Audrey (Maura Tierney) try endlessly to work with Fletcher's schedule of lies but it wears thin quickly. Making things tougher is Jerry (Cary Elwes) a friend who's moving out and wants Audrey and Max to come with him. Another large strain are the characters that take part in the court case, mainly Samantha Cole (Jennifer Tilly) the defendant and Fletcher's boss Miranda (Amanda Donohoe). All of these smaller threads are taken care of and provide the right character development for Carrey's role. The other interesting spin the writers put on this story is how the plot uses morals, ethics and social commentary on the judicial system as a backdrop for the entire message of the film.The only problem to the writing is the wish that Fletcher's son, Max makes. Up and until the wish is made and takes full effect, the audience gets the idea that the world they are in is the real world. However, when the wish is made Fletcher can't control himself. By what means made this come true and what's keeping him from making a lie? Most would consider this very nitpicky and too critical but it is a giant question in the film's story. Who has the power to grant these wishes? Do they apply to other children or people in general? All unanswered questions that probably the writers had no time to think about. The best supporting element to the story however is Jim Carrey's comedy. These are the moments that allow Jim Carrey to be himself and be spontaneous with his responses were which many are sure most lines were unscripted. But it's also not just the lines, the actions Fletcher takes to make sure that he doesn't get himself into trouble is hilarious too. Some of which situations are so extreme it makes the viewer wonder if one would go to such measures too.The other elements that work in this film's favor are the music and cinematography. The director of photography belongs to Russell Boyd who is competent in his work at getting the right shots from the courtroom to the office hallways. However, the best things Boyd does is when Fletcher starts going crazy. This leads to various angles at which the camera portrays other objects in the room as other living things. That's clever because audiences then begin to believe the object being focused on is living. As for music composed by John Debney who didn't have many well-known scores released at the time manages to pull off the comedic and dramatic scenes quite well. The only negative thing that can be said is that it sounds very dated with its familiar like 90s family comedy drama sound. It sounds so 90s. Finally the only other thing that dates the movie more than it should have were the visual style of the haircuts and dressers back then. Haircuts like Jerry's are just really old looking now. Other than that it's good.The dated sounding music and visual appearance of the actors don't let it age well. Plus the reasoning behind how Max's wish came true weren't explored. But for the most part, the writing is spot on with well- developed characters, downright laugh out loud scenes, and the story's subtext commentaries it addresses.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"A sweet but generic comedy, that wouldn't nearly be as special without Jim Carrey.","Although I can't say I'm a mega-fan of Jim Carrey's form of comedy, he was completely perfect for the role as Fletcher Reede, the arrogant lawyer who is as wholly strange as he is truly loving of his son. This love really is the heart of the film (no pun intended), but without Jim Carrey's over-the-top face-pulling performances, 'Liar Liar' would be relatively unspecial - a so-so plot, bland cinematography, an unmemorable score and more cheese than the dairy section of a supermarket.

We laughed hysterically at the not-so-subtle innuendoes aimed at balancing career with parenthood (in Fletcher's case, being a defense attorney with questionable clientele and the premise of his having to tell the truth for 24 hours, due to his son's birthday wish, is brilliant.)

A lot of crazy things happen and I found myself laughing out loud many times... often in absurd moments like him dumping a garbage can on himself in the toilet. Asking myself why am I laughing to this, it's not even funny...but it just is!

"Mugger, Mugger","Caught up with this one on TV last night. Beats me why anyone would want to be the new Jerry Lewis, but My Lord, Jim Carrey surely does seem to want to be here. (Or perhaps he'd rather be a cartoon? He certainly seemed ideal for The Mask and The Riddler.)He mugs, he pratfalls, he does funny (?) voices, he even literally beats himself up, in pursuit of a laugh. But it's an awful lot of effort for a fairly poor return.The plot is basically the same as Bob Hope's Nothing But the Truth, with the addition of a mystical element (and does it strike you as strange how many adults are willing to believe that a child's birthday wish has come true, after about two seconds of convincing?) I bailed out before the no holds barred, all stops out sentimental redeeming climax, which was being telegraphed so heavily, I was suffering sugar overload ten minutes before it arrived.Reasonably entertaining. 7 out of 10 because I'm feeling generous.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Jim Carrey: attorney at law,"Liar Liar is a perfect utilisation of Jim Carrey's immense comedic talent through expert use of writing, timing, and an emotional-enough story to ground it all from becoming too ludicrously unhinged.The premise is genius and executed to its full extent, with Carrey probably at the height of his game in delivering every joke either asked of him or improvised, demonstrating incredible physical overacting. Able to portray a man who's straining physically and mentally in minor to major attempts at lying. This sets up several hilarious sequences back-to-back that make up a majority of the film. And it's all backed by a great supporting cast who all do their parts wonderfully, from the innocently naive Cary Elwes to the exotically evil Jennifer Tilly. But perhaps the most interesting aspect about what makes this movie work is the dramatic element that rounds it all out, creating a dysfunctional father-son dynamic the centre of it all, supported by a compelling-enough courtroom plot.The only negative thing I can say is there may be moments before the premise fully kicks in that feel overacted and not as tame as how they maybe should be played out, but it's avery minor nitpick.Regardless, Liar Liar is able to flawlessly entertain, delivering countless laughs through endless physical and verbal gags that land every time.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

He plays a busy, divorced lawyer who has the best of intentions regarding his five-year-old son Max but often winds up disappointing him. He also often takes the easy way out of situations by lying, usually the little white ones. On his son's birthday, he fails to appear at the party because he's having sex with an attorney (Amanda Donohue) who can help him become partner; he lies, obviously, about why he's not there. His son wishes that his father could just not lie for one day. He gets his wish.The premise is very funny, because I think most of us are not aware of the little platitudes we use so that we don't insult someone, hurt their feelings, or ruin our careers by stating what we really think of someone in power. In the situation of the Carrey character, he has to go into court to defend an adulterous wife (Jennifer Tilly) with a prenup that cuts her out if she ever cheated and claim she never committed adultery. Given his son's wish, he's finding the circumstances impossible.The story is nothing new, but Carrey's take on it is unique to him as he throws himself on the floor, writhes, sputters, makes noises with his throat, screws up his face - all as he's trying not to lie.The thing about Carrey is, you have to be in the mood for his specialized, way over the top humor.

"A Thin, Sappy Premise is Improved by Carrey's Dominant Personality","Fletcher Reede, a scummy lawyer and unreliable father, catches a dose of humility when his young son uses a birthday wish to momentarily halt his fibbing ways. Thanks to a mystical plot device, dad can't tell a lie for twenty-four hours, which is bad timing as he already has a lucrative court date on the books and his estranged wife is entertaining the idea of taking the kid and leaving town. Selfish though he may be, Reede does love the little tyke and would be heartbroken to fade out of his life.The practical rules of this curse are a little hazy. Not only must the victim speak with complete honesty, he also can't shut up or control his most basic physical urges. Any time somebody asks a question, usually of the transparent setup variety, he spits a frank opinion and then goggles, bashfully, like a misbehaving child who's about to catch the rod. Though obnoxious, this blunt mechanic works to emphasize the film's only major strength: an adlib-happy Jim Carrey in the prime of his comedic career. Or maybe just a hair past his prime. Either way, Liar Liar serves as an effective vehicle for Carrey's unique brand of contortionist charisma and far over-the-top vocalizations. These alone elevate a thin comedy, which would've otherwise made for bargain basement straight-to-video fodder, into something a few steps higher. Good enough to draw nine digits at the box office, anyway.So it's Carrey as the magnetically overbearing sort, a role he'd already played countless times but hadn't totally worn out, trying to make things right with a cute youngster while wearing an expensive suit.

It's completely silly in parts, way over-the-top, and belongs to the good thick family humor but is, somehow, still funny. Thanks Jim Carrey. The film in itself is fine, the story is alright and allows for a good morality at the end.

Like for example in the boardroom scene, that scene would've been much funnier if Carry had still said all of the exact same things but if he'd just toned it down about 20 notches. And the boardroom manager's reactions were just as bad, so forced, annoying, and draining to watch, I felt like doing the same thing Carry did at the end of that scene, he fainted. The same problem occurred in a scene where Carrey's secretary asked him a question about if he would normally lie if she was asking him that same question. Just watching Carrey yell and kick and put his fingers in his ears and make and twist faces when she was trying to talk to him, I was not laughing even slightly, I was totally irritated. Carrey's exaggerated overacting continued through a lot of the film. And it's a damn shame because the other aspects of the film were pretty darn hilarious. The idea was a good one, about what Carry would say in given situations if he was unable to lie for a day. And many of the things he said were very very funny. Like what he said to the guy at the impound lot, or what he said to the cop pulling him over, or what he said to his different work colleagues at his law firm, or the things he said in the courtroom, or the things he said to his sexy client (Jennifer Tilly). Very creative, funny lines from Carry. It's too bad he had to overact so forcefully in the way he delivered them, so in your face. I could imagine Groucho Marx saying similar kinds of lines in a similar kind of plot, but it would be so much funnier due to the difference in the deliveries from the two different guys. Groucho did not overact like that. I did like the way Carrey bonded with his five year old son, and the scenes with his ex. She kind of reminded me of Jennifer Aniston. Carrey's ex's new boyfriend Cary Ewles was seen in a more American role, instead of the English acting and English accent he's been very good with in films like ""Princess Bride"".",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A good comedy borrowed from an earlier smash comedy,"This is a pretty good comedy with Jim Carry as Fletcher Reede, a fast-talking attorney who has to tell the truth for one full day. He promised his son, Max (Justin Cooper) that he would not tell a lie for 24 hours. Fletcher has some encounters during the day that are very funny. Some others seem forced or contrived for the plot and don't register much on the humor scale.""Liar Liar"" is an idea borrowed from an early 20th century book that was made into a very good 1941 movie. Bob Hope stars in it, along with Paulette Goddard and a host of top supporting actors of the day. But, where that film, ""Nothing But the Truth"" has some very funny dialog and crazy antics based on sophisticated comedy, this film has a single track for comedy.The 1941 film plot was based on a character who always believed in telling the truth. And he had three protagonists who were out to trip him up. All of that generated much mayhem at times, along with tremendous comedy. In this film, Carrey's character is faced with a reverse of his usual character. His rapid-fire style as an attorney was constantly peppered with untruths, and he lied often in his personal life with his family.So, he is challenged to keep his promise by himself, and has some funny scenarios as a result. This happens in discussions with cohorts, staff and clients. It is entertaining and a fun film. But, it can't match the comedy of the 1941 film that has a cast of characters divided between Hope's business buddies trying to trip him up on the one hand, and a larger group of people who are shocked by what he often says to avoid telling even a fibAfter watching this film, modern audiences should get many more laughs watching ""Nothing But the Truth"" of 1941.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Entertaining,"With a sincere & emotional story at heart, this hilarious flick turns out to be enjoyable while touching at the same time. I credit all the entertainment to the lead star Jim Carrey, for his amusing antics and perfect comic timing.

The story is very simple and cute, and unveils the potential for unlimited funny moments. I felt that it could have been capitalized on better.I found the ending funny but cliché, and that is where my scoring of the film comes down. Also, I did not like the wife's unsurity about which man to choose. She was not nice to the other man who loved her.

A comedy with a conscience,"""Liar Liar,"" starring Jim Carrey, is a comedy that blends humor with a heartwarming message. Carrey plays Fletcher Reede, a fast-talking lawyer whose career thrives on his ability to lie. However, his life takes a drastic turn when his son makes a birthday wish that Fletcher can't tell a lie for 24 hours.Carrey's signature physical comedy and expressive performance are the film's highlights. His antics, as he struggles to navigate a day without lying, provide plenty of laughs and showcase his comedic talent. The movie's premise is simple yet effective, leading to numerous hilarious situations that keep the audience engaged.However, ""Liar Liar"" occasionally leans too heavily on slapstick, and some jokes can feel repetitive. The supporting characters, while adding to the story, aren't deeply developed. Despite these flaws, the film's charm lies in its underlying message about honesty and the importance of family.""Liar Liar"" is a lighthearted, entertaining film that, while not without its shortcomings, delivers a fun experience bolstered by Jim Carrey's standout performance.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Liar Liar,"This movie was a Liar Liar because the reviews suggested it would be good and I would laugh, and I did not. The ""humor"" was just Jim Carrey screaming and making idiotic sound effects and gestures for 90 minutes because in the story he's unable to lie. I don't get why he wouldn't just not say anything at times versus having to tell the truth in an explosive way. Regardless the story line was decent enough and there was a feel good progression by the end of it. It was overall decent but not nearly as memorable as the reviews and other people will have you believe. IMDb PLEASE get rid of this minimum.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Liar Liar: 6/10,"Jim Carrey can be funny when he wants to be. Although he isn't the greatest comedian, he's sometimes quuite funny. His attempts at dramatic work aren't half bad, either. His prime of comedies came in the late 90's, with such movies like Liar Liar. In it, the script's written for him and he doesn't need to do any acting, just make faces at the camera. That has got to be the world's easiest job.Carrey plays Fletcher Reede, a lawyer who is known for winning a case in any way possible. However, he rarely has time for his wife and son, so they break up. And any time that he is supposed to do something with his son, Fletcher never makes it and makes an excuse. So for his son's birthday, he wishes that his father would never tell a lie for one whole day. And lo and behold, it comes true. On the day of Fletcher's most important case, he can't tell a single lie, which causes distress in his job and more.For the most part, Liar Liar is a good comedy. It's entertaining, it's humorous, and a plot that goes someplace. Although some of the subplots don't really go anyplace, or don't really work, like his wife's new relationship, it did open up another trademark Carrey ""funny thing"", like The Mask did with ""Smokin'!"" and Ace Ventura did with ""All righty then!"", and that is the whole thing about The Claw, which is pretty funny. Tom Shadyac seems to know how to direct Carrey and not to really have the camera off of him, which works well, since his constant mugging to the camera and his zany antics are basically what make up the movie.On the downside of everything, though, there's one thing that takes away from the movie. That's the lack of laughter that was going through me. Although it's very entertaining, and something I would be able to watch again, I never really laughed much, I was just entertained throughout, which is all I asked for.My rating: 6/10Rated PG-13 for sex related humor and language.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Classic Classic,"Being a major Jim Carrey nut, I have to say that this is his best comedy (his best serious movie being the mesmerizing ""Eternal Sunshine""), and the one that stands up to the most amount of repeated viewings. Not only do you pick up new jokes each time you watch it, but the jokes you were already aware of are no less hilarious on second, third, fourth, or in my case, thirty-seventh, viewing. This makes Liar Liar a classic comedy which will always have people who can appreciate Carrey's über-wacky sense of humour toppling over laughing. Unlike in Ace Ventura, Carrey actually has a solid (and original) plot to work with here, and the messages about the dangers of neglecting your family can be as touching as you want them to be - but I'd advice you just shut out the messages and enjoy Jim's madness.The movie is helped by a fantastic supporting cast, including a cute Maura Tierny as Fletcher's ex wife, Cary Elwes as the sublimely dorky stepdaddy, Jennifer Tilly as Fletcher's sexy client Samantha Cole, and the late Jason Bernard as the honourable (pfft) Judge Stevens. Justin Cooper is also good as Fletcher's son Max, which says a lot since most Hollywood actors his age seemingly just graduated from the Hayden Christensen School of Being Annoying.The script is incredibly witty and hilarious - those who said that Americans can't make comedy beyond the usual Adam Sandler jokes need to think again. Even the not-so-great lines are rendered hilarious by Carrey's relentlessly goofy delivery. Unless you're plagued by a severe broomstick/backside injury, I guarantee you that Liar Liar will have you rolling.The bottom line is: Liar Liar is a classic comedy which will never get old. I'd write more, but I have this horrible pain in my arm...",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A pretty cute premise that just got overwhelmed by Carrey's brand of physical comedy.

Decent comic movie,"I think this is one of Jim Carrey's best movies. He clearly is ecstatic at being given free rein to express his physical, Jerry Lewis style comedy in every single scene. But he is capable of expressing the deeper emotional dilemmas underneath the character's manic facade -- the fear of losing his son, and the sudden panic that for some mysterious reason he can't lie. His whole life up until now has been a lie, so the movie becomes a fish out of water tale. It's like he has to deal with becoming a whole new person, and it is funny. As his world weary ex-wife, Maura Tierney is excellent. I like how the producers chose her -- someone capable of giving an individual, quirky performance -- and not some vacuous dumb bimbo. The character of Carrey's son is one of those factory line six year old boys -- bowl hair cut, cute little face, spilling out cute little lines. Which is no reflection on the little actor, it's just an annoying Hollywood 'type' that I wish they'd change. And the boy does have good comic timing. Jennifer Tilly, as Carrey's buxom, adulterous client, and Swoosie Kurtz, as the rival courtroom lawyer, are among an ensemble giving excellent acting support. To me, the best character is Carrey's secretary, played by the late Anne Haney. Haney came to acting very late, in her 40s, and when she played this role must have been in her 60s or 70s, yet she is a riot playing a strictly 'straight man' role, ridiculing Carrey's outrageous antics and utterings as he tries to lie, but can't. She plays that upright New England, morally correct personal assistant type to a T, and it's a pleasure to watch, and very funny. I think it's the quality and depth of the supporting roles that are often the most telling aspects of a film and so it is here. Even the judge, again playing it straight, shines as he takes many of Carrey's blatherings seriously, making them more funny.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

His son then makes a wish that his father won't lie for a day, and unfortunately for the dad, who's trying to win a case in court for a client who's clearly guilty. As you can see, it's a very funny setup and the movie delivers constant laughs, thanks to Carrey's 110% efforts in the physical comedy department. Throughout most of the movie, Carrey's character doesn't want to have to tell the truth so the a highly visible battle between the side of him that doesn't want to tell the truth and the spell cast on the other side of him which, provides Carrey with the perfect arena he's been looking for to showcase his high-energy antics since his sophomoric days of Ace Ventura and Dumb and Dumber.

Not only was this a hysterical comedy, but it also had a serious family element to it that was crucial for Carrey's advancement into his role in ""The Truman Show"". This was an excellent stepping stone into the world of serious film.  This movie was a more acceptable ""serious role"" because he still had his moments to spaz out and make the audience laugh.  I especially loved seeing the outtakes before the credits.  Just watching them shows Carrey's creativity and spontaneity, which is that extra ""oompf"" that makes him stand out.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Jim Carrey at his best.,"Fletcher Reede is a competent lawyer who has learned that lying is easier and more rewarding than telling the truth. This will change when his son decides to ask as a birthday wish that Dad spend at least a full day without being able to lie. A day that will change Reede's life. Or at least that was the intention of Jim Carrey in this deeply beautiful and touching film, where the laughter mingles with the beauty of the love shown by a father who truly wants to regain his family. The script, by telling a morally edifying story in an effective way, can therefore be considered as one of the strongest points of this film.Jim Carrey has achieved here one of his most important successes. With it, he became a consecrated comedian. His performance is truly colossal, there isn't a moment where he doesn't shine, completely overshadowing the rest of the cast, with the honorable exception of Justin Cooper, who gives life to the sweet and innocent son of the lawyer. Some of the scenes involving Reede and Max are worthy of humorous anthologies.Personally, I consider this film as the consecration of Jim Carrey, rather than the most famous and popular ""Bruce Allmighty"", who came a little after. The story is very simple but beautiful, the cast work was very competent, the direction of Tom Shadyac worked well... basically everything was up to the project. It's not an exceptional film, it's not a timeless work of art. It's a film for familiar entertainment, to see and to laugh. If viewed in this light, it's an excellent film.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Why only a 6.9/10 rating?!?,"I was surprised to see that this movie only got a 6.9/10. Personally I find this one of Jim's best movies.

One of the 1/10 reviews claimed they turned of the movie after 30 minutes. So how can you give a review? The scene with the pen is brilliant in my humble opinion, as well as the scene with the traffic cop. And if you have watched this movies blooper reel, you know there must have been a lot of fun on set. How can there not be? It's Jim Carrey. Just like Jack Black, he seems to have no off-switch.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Occasionally important comedy that Carrey once again steals,"Fletcher (Carrey) is having difficulty seeing his son, putting his career first. On his birthday his son Max (Cooper) wishes that Fletcher can't tell a lie for a whole day.Jim Carrey has always been a comic genius. From the wonderfully daft Ace Ventura to the insane Mask, the actor has been pleasing audiences for years. On seeing Yes Man in cinemas recently, I couldn't help but feel he has out grown that wonderful slapstick nature he produced so easily. Many have critics have said that recent flick is this 1997 picture all over again, only with a bungee jump and a Terrance Stamp lecture thrown in, and in all honesty, that really is the case, though this is thankfully funnier.With an inevitable ending and a central character who has to overcome a difficulty for everything to be alright again this is conventional cinema at its most obvious. But, and it's a big but, Carrey has taken his comic ability and thrust that into the central character which will please fans and his Fletcher feels like a somebody, more because he knows he is a bad father.The issue of parenting is brought up frequently, though far from significant as it was in other comedies like Ferris Bueller's Day off. Thanks to the encoding of this important issue, the story itself feels important, but then it is still lost on cinematic stereotyping and conventional story. As good as the comedy is to; the shine falls on that instead of the important issue of parenthood.Justin Cooper is really good as Max, a young lad who wants a strong role model. The supporting cast otherwise offers no surprises with everyone as predictable as next Easter.The narrative with its predictable nature still surprises every so often. There are some sharp moments and Carrey's funny nature maintains likability. His humour is the only reason to carry on watching. The first ten minutes or so are incredibly unfunny by his standard so hang on in there for some great slapstick and insulting comedy.To be fair the narrative offers up a twist towards the end, but this appears as an attempt to preach to an audience already lost in the comic nature of the film. Kudos of including it though as most comedies round off straight away.Liar Liar, though consistently predictable, has a charm and a likability that can't be ignored and though the preaching of parenthood is obscured by the comedy, it still feels important.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Carrey is the King of Comedy,"""Liar Liar"" (1997) is an absolute triumph that firmly establishes Jim Carrey as the undisputed king of comedy, earning a resounding 10/10 stars in my book. Carrey's performance in this film is nothing short of iconic, showcasing his unparalleled comedic prowess and solidifying his status as a comedic legend.What makes ""Liar Liar"" truly exceptional is the seamless balance it strikes between adult humor and feel-good family entertainment. Carrey's physical comedy, facial expressions, and impeccable timing elevate the humor to a level that transcends generational boundaries. The film's script cleverly weaves together witty dialogue and slapstick comedy, delivering a perfect blend that keeps audiences of all ages roaring with laughter.At the heart of this comedy masterpiece is Carrey's portrayal of a dishonest lawyer forced to tell the truth for 24 hours due to his son's birthday wish. Carrey's charisma and energy radiate on screen, turning every scene into a comedic spectacle. His ability to bring genuine emotion to the character adds depth to the film, making it more than just a series of laughs.Beyond the laughs, ""Liar Liar"" imparts a heartwarming message about the importance of honesty and the impact it has on personal relationships. This layer of emotional depth elevates the film from being a mere comedy to a timeless classic with a meaningful narrative.The supporting cast, including Maura Tierney and Justin Cooper, seamlessly meshes with Carrey's comedic brilliance. The chemistry between the characters enhances the overall experience, making ""Liar Liar"" not only a laugh-out-loud comedy but also a heartwarming family film.In summary, ""Liar Liar"" is a testament to Jim Carrey's reign as the king of comedy. It's a cinematic masterpiece that effortlessly juggles adult humor and family-friendly entertainment, solidifying its status as a timeless classic. For those seeking an uproarious yet heartwarming experience, ""Liar Liar"" deserves every bit of its perfect 10/10 rating.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Carrey's comedic talent makes for an entertaining film,"Liar Liar is a comedy. It'll make you laugh. Beyond that, it doesn't have much to offer, but that is to be expected when you see a comedy starring Jim Carrey.The plot of this film is incredibly thin and unimaginative. Clearly most of the writing went into the jokes, and not the story. I can ignore this for the most part because, again, the sole purpose of this film is to make us laugh. But the idea that a lawyers neglected son makes a birthday wish that his dad cannot tell a lie for one day (and it comes true) is quite ludicrous. I mean, that's what the whole movie is based on. To watch this, you don't just have to stretch your imagination, you have to throw reality away altogether and fully immerse yourself in this ridiculous story. But, if you can do that, it's actually quite funny, and you'll have a good time with it. As long as you remember that the movie is not meant to be at all plausible, you should have a fun time.Of course, this is a comedy, so who cares about the plot, right? All that matters is whether or not it makes you laugh enough to justify its existence. And I can say, this film does accomplish that goal. There are some genuinely hilarious moments in this movie, though I have to say, it did feel like most of the funniest material was in the middle of the film. The beginning and end were a little weak on the humor. However, I can disregard this for the most part because of how funny the second act is. When Fletcher (Jim Carrey) first realizes that he is unable to tell lies, it was almost non-stop laugh-out-loud humor. It may not have had the most well thought-out script, but the comedy in this film was incredibly clever at many moments. Again, you have to be willing to forget about how dumb the plot is, but as long as you can do that, this is a hilarious movie.The messaging of this film was also a nice touch. Essentially, it is teaching that family is always the most important thing, and spending time with the people you love is something you never have an excuse to skip. I guess there was kind of a message about being honest as well, but that was more unclear, because Fletcher's explanation of how lying is sometimes necessary as an adult is actually quite true. I mean let's be honest, we can see from this movie how impossible it would be to get around always being completely honest with everyone. I guess you could say the message is to be honest to those you love and trust, which would make more sense. Anyway, the messages of this movie are good, but I've seen them done better in other films (for example, the importance of spending time with family is illustrated much better in the movie ""Elf""). Again, being a comedy, the messages are not quite as important for a film like this, so it was really just an added bonus to have something else besides laughter that you can take away from this movie.Of course, the number one reason this film works is because of the incredible comedic talent of Jim Carrey. He is the reason so much of the humor is able to land effectively. It was also interesting to see him playing a mostly normal person. We still do get his way over-the-top scenes every now and then that are, for the most part, pretty funny, though I actually preferred most of the humor that was delivered while he was acting normal. Carrey's overacting was still effective in getting some laughs, though, and he was the sole reason this film worked in the first place. Without him, this would have been a terrible movie, but because of him, it's a solidly entertaining film.Beyond Carrey, the rest of the performances were passable. None of them were outright terrible, but it was mostly a bunch of mediocre performances where no one in particular stood out. With this being Jim Carrey's movie, and for the most part, his movie alone, this didn't really have a huge negative impact on the end result. However, I do still feel that it would have helped to have a few more dynamic performances beyond just Carrey's.Liar Liar is overall a film that's both entertaining and funny enough to justify its existence. Jim Carrey's acting abilities allow the humor to land quite effectively, creating many laugh-out-loud moments. A thin plot and poorly executed messages hold this back from being a great film, but it's still a fun movie to watch.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Cute and Funny at Times; Dumb and Obnoxious at Others,"Fletcher Reede (Jim Carrey) is a scummy lawyer, a terrible father, and a pathological liar. He fails to show up at key moments in his young son's life, much to the annoyance of his ex-wife Audrey (Maura Tierney). After missing his son Max's (Justin Cooper) birthday party, Max wishes that his father would be incapable of lying for one day. This happens the night before Fletcher would be forced to give false testimony in order to win a prenuptial divorce settlement worth millions for a gold-digging wife (Jennifer Tilly). What follows is a series of genuinely comedic and heartfelt moments mixed in and marred with Carrey's annoying buffoonery and zaniness, and a dull, generic, and uninteresting plot.The funny moments come not from Jim Carrey's performance and wacky epileptic outbursts, but from the reactions of shock and dismay from the people he is forced to confront with the truth. Maybe it's just a personal thing, I've heard friends praise Carrey in this film (and others similar to it starring him), but I just find him incredibly grating and annoying. Which is very interesting because I love him when he plays a more subdued and down to earth role in more serious movies like ""The Truman Show"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", two of my absolute favorites of all time.This one isn't without its own merits, and there were times when I legitimately laughed out loud. It is funny. But at the same time the story is extremely dull and simple, fitting in with a whole list of generic 90s family comedies like ""Billy Madison"" and ""Kindergarten Cop."" Sure, it's got a fantastical element to it with Fletcher's inability to lie, but it's not all that interesting, as the nature of the curse is never given any further explanation and is only used to get Fletcher into wild and uncomfortable situations. The finale at the airport is also just really, really stupid.If you're a die hard Carrey fan, a fan of aforementioned hit comedies from the 1990s, or are just channel-surfing and have nothing better to spend ninety minutes of your time with, you might consider giving it a watch. Otherwise, you can safely skip this one and won't be missing a thing.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fun! But not really my taste.,"Liar Liar (1997) follows a lawyer when his life is turned upside down as he finds he can't lie for 24 hours. This film is pretty fun to watch and is definitely entertaining, but follows a very simple formula which results in it feeling quite forgettable.The cinematography is pretty basic and there isn't much to talk about in terms of visuals, however I don't find this to be much of a problem as the main focus of the film is on its characters and humour. The film also uses mainly natural light, which is fine, but can be a bit bland at times.The sound design is very average, and the score is incredibly 90s sounding! The score does get a bit too overbearing sometimes but its what I expect from a movie like this. I would've liked the film to have a soundtrack too, I feel this could've improved it quite a lot and could add more life to it.The film features a great cast, with some decent characters. I'm not always a fan of Jim Carrey's exaggerated facial expressions and humour so his performance didn't always hit for me, but I understand how he's well loved by a lot of movie fans! He is fun to watch, and I grew to like his character regardless of how much he made me cringe. The film also has some cute, and entirely predictable, character development.The film is fast paced and fun for the most part, but does get a bit too stupid sometimes. The movie follows a basic narrative and manages to entertain the audience just enough, ending on a sweet, feel-good note.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Because the boy is so disappointed by his dad, he wishes that the man will be honest for an entire day and surprise, surprise: his wish comes true.What you get is typical Jim Carrey, but it works perfectly if you ask me. It could have been a corny movie that you would love to hate (in other words a typical Disney movie), but he made something original out of it. In some movies he really exaggerates and then I'm not a fan of his work, but this time his style and overacting didn't bother me once. I had a great time watching this movie and was laughing all the time. I just loved the idea of the career driven lawyer who always lies but now has to be honest for an entire day and therefor almost loses his job and career that is so dear to him. I'm sure that many lawyers in real life would have a lot of difficulties as well if they had to be honest for one day.All in all this is one of Jim Carrey's finest comedies. I truly hope that he'll make a lot more movies of this kind and leaves others like Ace Ventura to others. I give this one an 8/10. I loved it.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It's hilarious and that's the truth!,"I have seen this a couple of times and it may be Carrey at his best(mentally I switch between this and Me Myself and Irene).The plot follows Jim playing a father who lies to his son frequently. His son, Max, hates this, so he wishes on his 5th birthday(since his Dad is too busy having sex) that his Dad will go one day without lying.This works, and his father gets himself in outrageous trouble for it.I was sheltered as a kid but I was allowed to see a few PG-13 movies. At first my Mom allowed me to see this-but then she realized how dirty it was. There's a ton of sexual references that neither of us approved of. (One involves Carrey in court saying ""You had sex with her every single time you met her!"") I had to sell the VHS at a garage sale.I have seen it a couple of times since and I still love it. Yes it's crude but It's Jim Carrey-what would you expect? Horton Hears A Who? This is PG-13, not G! It's hilarious throughout, and that's what matters!Some my be surprised that I am giving this a 10, ranking it with movies like Citizen Kane and The Ten Commandments. I am not saying this is a masterpiece. A 10 means I was entertained from start to end to an extent, and I was indeed entertained for the entirety of the movie. That's all that matters to me.Liar Liar is hilarious and that is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pretty funny!,"This is my favourite Jim Carrey film other than Bruce Almighty, it is undeniably funny, if a bit corny at times, but it's a Jim Carrey film so that's part of the shtick I guess.It's quite well written and meaningful as well as functioning well as a comedy film it's also slightly emotional at times. The story is pretty good too for a comedy film. It seems that quite a number have mentioned this but the outtakes are hysterical, genuinely some of the funniest I have seen in a film. The acting is solid, I particularly enjoyed Maura Tierney's performance.It's quite a good comedy and I would watch it again, I have already seen it at least 10 times down the years.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Nonstop laughs,"Jim Carrey proves once again his prowess for physical, slapstick comedy in this hysterically funny film about a lawyer who finds himself unable to lie. As a fan of the show, ""In Living Color,"" I enjoyed Carrey immensely when he was at his zaniest, doing just about anything for a laugh. This movie allows him to let everything hang out without being overly silly (like in ""Dumb and Dumber"" and ""The Mask"", and he hits all the right marks. A perfect movie for when you want to just sit back and laugh, his performance is brilliant. Justin Cooper, the little boy who plays his son is absolutely adorable. Maura Tierney does a bang-up job as Carrey's ex, and she plays the straight role to a tee. Swoosie Kurtz and Jennifer Tilly, and Amanda Donohoe are tailor-made for their roles and add the perfect flavor to this delicious film. I loved it.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Overdramatic,"The protagonist has been extremely excited for ever action he did ever after his son made the wish; it's like the actor is trying way too hard. The thing is, humans are not meant to be this excited for such a prolonged time- neither the actor nor the audience. This made this film nearly impossible for me to appreciate. Plus the ending makes no sense, and the action of the protagonist in that is incredibly dangerous and irresponsible, both to himself and to everyone in the plane.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Lies, Lies........no lies anywhere!","This movie is brilliant! Simply brilliant! It is so hilarious, and so funny, words can not begin to describe it. Even though I know it to be impossible I will give it a shot.The story is simply magnificent! It is like a story from a children's storybook, a book of old fairy tales. It's so amazingly brilliant and clever, I am actually out of words. No kidding! The story is so touching. It's the story of the love between father and son, mixed with jealousy, scumbags, Jim Carrey and the truth.It is a masterpiece of a movie! I have seen it several times before and still I did not mind watching it again. Actually, it was as if I had never seen it before. The acting in this movie is no less than the one of a master. Jim Carrey is a true legend. He is one of the funniest persons in the history of funny persons. He is one of the best comedians this world has ever seen. His humor is like no other. His acting indescribably unique and utter genius. He is beyond comparison! His brilliancy is also previewed in other movies, such as, ""Ace Ventura: The Pet Detective"", ""Bruce Almighty"", ""A series of unfortunate events"", ""Yes man"". And around the Christmas holidays, we think of ""A Christmas Carol"" and ""The Grinch"" of course. Timeless classics! Last time I checked Mr. Carrey was the 69th highest ranked actor in the world according to www.IMDb.com. I am not surprised by this, but I am surprised he is not ranked higher. He is nothing short of a genius! He is one of my favorite actors. Along with Jackie Chan, Mark Vincent (AKA Vin Diesel), Will Smith, Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Owen Wilson, Leo DiCaprio, Johnny Depp (definitely) and many more. Anywho, my point is this. ""Liar, Liar"" is a great movie and I couldn't find a single negative thing to say about it, therefore, I give it 10/10 stars. 100%. Yup, that is correct. That is my opinion and I am sticking to it.Bon Soir. Guten Nacth. Buenos Noches. Goodnight. God natt.Shevy",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A great comedy with a good heart,"It's a feel-good lighthearted comedy that wears a good heart on its sleeve. This movie unexpectedly made me cry during the court room scene where the kids want to hug the dad. There's a lot of moments that are actually really funny where I was laughing loudly. It's actually a well written movie that has meaning and purpose and it never feels like it drags. I love all the callbacks this movie has to Jim's other films. Like him bursting out of the luggage at the airport closely resembled the rhinoceros scene in Ace Ventura. The bald guy at the beginning that tries to give Fletcher his coat back is also the same guy who played the disgruntled guy at the beginning of Ace Ventura. This movie is unexpectedly sincerely heartfelt, it does a good job at tugging at the heart strings. The soundtrack is underrated.

Not Carrey's best moment,"Carrey was quickly a household name with films like Pet Detective, Dumb & Dumber, and The Mask. Those roles were really made for him. But films like Me, Myself & Irene, The Cable Guy, and Liar Liar just prove that a popular actor can't always fit into just any role nor make a film great. There are some films where Carrey's particular brand of comedy wasn't really the focal point like Bruce Almighty, which could have been done by another actor but which Jim made into a really good role for himself. But if we think of Schwarzenegger in Kindergarten Cop or Twins, we might say that his comedic prowess could have actually made Liar Liar a great film. Jack Black, Tom Hanks, Owen Wilson... Almost anyone might have made a more believable character here. However, with Carrey's the over-the-top schlapp schtick it became almost torturous as the crude humor wore on and on. I'm not sure why this film is PG13, there's far too much cleavage and sexual situations. I'm not sure who this film is aimed at. As a mother, I was in so much pain for that little boy and anger that the mother didn't protect him from the continuous behavior of the neglectful father. And while they did aptly title this film Fantasy, as well as comedy, it's clearly a far-fetched ending that such a man could really change that much. It's a ironic to know that in Jim's later years, he openly despised the intense fame he acquired, his humor based on being a lonely angry child, and began discussing peace and tranquility in the few interviews he gave. He's still a favorite in terms of having virtually invented a genre of doing animation imitation that we all have loved at some point. But this is a film I wish I hadn't bothered to watch.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Although it has a simple plot, Jim Carrey becomes this genius who just made this movie perfect with his hilarious performance. I also like the character development and the sweet, beautiful ending. This is also one of the few comedies that really not only entertains us, but gives us lessons in life as well.10/10! Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
truth hurts...,"Fletcher Reede (Jim Carrey), is a lawyer who is estranged from his wife Audrey (Maura Tierney). His occupations maintain him far from his home and particularly from his son Max. But he really loves him. One day, for his birthday, Max wishes that his father can't lie for 24 hours. His wish will come true since for 24 hours, Reede will be through a living hell. One must suffer to improve oneself...With ""Liar Liar"", the authors set themselves the following target: to conceive a tailor-made movie for Jim Carrey. Why? Because they surely realized that their topic was thin and it would pose problems to write a screenplay holding water. So, to compensate for the very reduced potential of the script they decided to give Carrey a free hand and to leave a very important part of the film in his hands. Thus, the actor, once revealed with ""the Mask"" (1994) gets out again, without trying to bring anything new to his acting his comical elements that secured his success. It means: his grimaces, his showy expressions and his implausible cues for a kind of one man-show which often borders on the unacceptable. Carrey does his best to bring an ounce of credibility to his character but his bombastic (the term is weak) performance only succeeds in massacring the film. Worse, his third-rate acting is so significant that it leaves little place to the other actors' acting. Actors who try with difficulty to play opposite Carrey.This poor comedy shows once again that exclusively relying on a main actor to save a film can be a serious mistake. Fortunately, it seems that Carrey after this flick wanted to give the image of a conscientious actor capable to direct his career. Indeed, we will see him holding more serious roles where he will be able to restrain his tendency to third-rate acting. Try ""the Truman Show"" (1998), ""Man on the Moon"" (1999) or more recently ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" (2004). Let's hope he goes on and perseveres in this way.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Underrated af; should be 10/10 rated,Unparalleled level of comedy that no other movie can even reach a fraction of. Jim carrey's delivery of the script via his voice and facial expressions are literally like no other actor ever. I loved the fact that it had a short story and it was not at all lengthy. It is perfect for an hour and a half. It leads the viewer on a rollercoaster of emotions ranging initially from disappointment to amusement and then eventually to full satisfaction with a happy ending. It could not have been better; therefore I see no reason why this movie shouldn't be getting a solid 10 out of 10 without a single doubt.,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This side-splitting movie is a sure-fire success. Jim Carrey freaking rocks!!!,"The movie is a laugh riot from the very start to the very end. I derived such pleasure from it and I can't get enough of it.The story tells us about a fast-talking lawyer Fletcher Reede for whom lying is the second nature. He uses lie as an ace in the hold to climb up the career ladder and eggs on his coworkers. He invariably falls back on his promises. This pertains to his son and ex-wife. Career is uppermost in his mind and he routinely overlooks his son. When Fletcher doesn't turn up on his son's birthday, the boy decided to make an honest man out of his dad. After the birthday wish Reede can't lie for 24 hours. The life of the workmanlike storyteller turns on its head. A lawyer who thrived on lying now can't utter an innocuous fib.Let's face it Jim Carrey is second to none. He gave a polished performance. He's immaculate on so many levels. I couldn't tear myself away form this rubber-faces guy. Make no mistake Jim Carrey's my favorite actor. For the life of me I can't understand why some folks have a thing about him.The supporting cast is pure gold. Aww, Justin Cooper is a love bug.

8 on a scale of 10,"This movie is much more than just a vehicle for Carrey's comedic genius. It is also a sensitive story about a father's love for his son as well as his ex-wife. Additionally, it has a wonderfully creative script which includes a unique 24 hour period where he is physically unable to lie. That makes for hilarious comedy.The movie is a little too goofy for any rating higher than an 8, though the goof factor is slightly lower (and certainly not the entire focus of this film) than usual. But, for what it was, I'm not sure I could ask for anything better.If you like Carrey, you will really like this movie.

After half a hour I had had more than enough, but I love Maura so stuck it out until the end. Sure there's a few laughs here and there but not nearly enough to compensate for Carrey's stomach turning idiotic performance. First, no judge would tolerate the ridiculous antics of this buffoon. And the judge's final decision is unfathomable absurd. Trust me, you will want to smash your television to oblivion after watching Jim make this face and that face and contort his body into all these weird positions. Not funny. Not dramatic. Not clever. His attack of conscience at the end was just the final nail in this commercial for Jim's ""talents."" Complete with a predictable sappy ending.

The reactions on his face are hysterical when he realizes that what he wants to say won't be coming out of his mouth and the exact opposite does.  It gets just a little schmaltzy in regard to his relationship with his son and ex-wife, but it's not so sentimental that it is nauseating.  In fact, it adds a more human touch.

The 90s were really full of films from Workaholics.,"The film is nothing big and nothing earth-shattering but the acting by Jim Carrey is so over-the-top that I find it a bit of a shame that you don't get an Oscar for comedy rolls.
In itself it is a really great idea with a nice message, but I don't know if it is wise to end up with a pretty malty kitschy Hollywood in a movie that is about telling the truth because in the end everything turns out well and the couple comes back together is the biggest lie. I am sorry for the new friend of mine because I really think that he is a personable person and they deserve more than Jim Carrey's character who is just too unappealing.Despite his thin plot, Liar Liar is highlighted by Jim Carrey's exuberant physical humor, and the result is a laughing revolt that has helped to add to the comedian's appeal.But I like that the film has a relatively vulgar and rough way that makes it much more believable even though it is an adult film for children it is not held back when people shout at each other.despite everything I'm not happy with the end and wonder if that was really the right decision because Jim Carrey is unemployed at the end of the film, a good man with good intentions didn't get married, a boy who had the opportunity to get into a bigger one Moving to town continues to live alone with his mother in a small apartment, and the woman has come together with a constant lying to the idiots.Also, if he's such a good liar, I mean why doesn't Fletcher Reede just become an actor.

The film that made me love Jim Carrey....,Before Liar Liar I wasn't really a big Jim Carrey fan. He was kind of funny but to over the top and his excesses became too much for me to find him really funny most of the time. In Liar Liar Jim Carrey goes for broke to make us laugh as always but the difference in the film is that his character is likeable. There is also a sweetneds to the film that makes it not only hilarious but also very endearing.Jim Carrey plays Fletcher Reede. A lawyer who built his entire career on lying. He is obsessed with his career. He is divorced but has a 5 year old son that worships his father. But his constant lying strains his relationship with his son. His son is so sad that his father doesn't show up for his birthday that he makes a wish that Fletcher couldn't lie for a day. What ensues is in my opinion Jim Carrey's most hilarious performance.

"Great Premise with a Predictable Storyline, but an Amazing Physical Performance from Jim Carrey","Arguably one of the better Jim Carrey 90's classics that's mostly held up pretty well with its timeless scenario and how far they push the concept. The 90's schmaltz can be a bit much at times (especially the overly whimsical trademark 90's soundtrack), but god damn, is Jim Carrey's performance impressive. His physicality and spontaneous improvisation every time he has to tell the truth is really impressive and easily carries the movie. It's a funny premise that's executed very well and arguably one of Jim Carrey's better comedies. The movie has a great premise with a predictable storyline, but an amazing physical performance by Jim Carrey.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Geeky Randy's summary,"Fletcher Reede (Carrey) is a fast track lawyer who continuously turns down his son Max (Cooper). When Fletcher stands Max up at his birthday party, Max makes a birthday wish that just for one day his father can't tell a lie. Carrey goes the extra mile, with his witty courtroom remarks and Looney Tunes body language; his performance is consistent, and it doesn't ware thin. Cooper falls into the category of the ""Annoying Hollywood child actor"". The movie doesn't go without other flaws, but the climax and the conclusion are by far the worst--they're over-the-top and unrealistic, even for THIS! Cary Elwes does a fantastic job in a supporting role as Fletcher's ex-wife's (Tierney) new goober love-interest.** (out of four)",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Carrey in fine form,"There's a virtuous message at the heart of ""Liar Liar"" (a yuppie lawyer learns the cost of putting career before child) that helps the movie achieve timelessness; and that's part of the reason this is still so watchable after twenty years. It's even one of those ""cable movies"" that tends to draw you in whenever it's on.But seriously, can you think of anyone other than Jim Carrey who could've carried this movie? Even back in mid-'90s Hollywood. Absolutely not, and most of the laughs come from just pulling the ripcord and watching him go. It's his anarchic style and manic energy that gives the dialogue its potency. The supporting cast is left to do the heavy lifting while Carrey owns the screen. And it's for the best. This is over-the-top in the best sense, and it remains highly watchable today.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
a lovely movie,Jim Carrey has to be one of my favorite comedians ever!!! I love him so much! He gives such heart and energy to his roles and I love him for it! He is so good in this movie. He is such an unlikable character at first but then after his son makes that wish and he isn't able to lie anymore you kind of feel for him. You can tell that he really loves his son and that all his son wants is to spend more time with his dad and for his dad to not break his promises. This is such a sweet and charming story and I believe this is one of Jim Carrey's best performances ever. He really gives it his all. Especially in the boardroom scene. I will always love this movie and it will always be a classic to me.,8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I still admire defense lawyers more than the other ones.,"I can empathize why Jim Carrey is a polarizing actor. But there is something operatic about his face alone. Sometimes it all goes too far and becomes what I call ""actor gags"" where the humor is all in the performer with nothing funny in the joke at all.But I can't not be fascinated by the particular physicality of this man's interpretation of the role. Sort of like a snake devouring a pig it morbidly demands the attention.There's a fine plot here and all but thankfully the experience is just a joke book of stuff they could come up with surrounding the central idea. It is pretty cool to explore how this curse works. I did find it a little strange that he was not able to ask a question that he knew would lead to a lie but could still lie by omission, but hey, who said that the wish granting gods were perfect?The more human side of the movie with the non-Carrey characters is a lot less charming but they never dwell on it and in the meantime I never got bored enjoying one goofy gag after another.And overall I did sort of like the sentimental father-son aspect too.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Best line : ""You can make a living out of making faces!""","Liar liar is pretty much a one-man-show of a movie. Nobody could carry out the main role but Carrey, simply because it was built FOR and AROUND Carrey - it's quite obvious. I hardly laughed more than 3 times during the whole film, because it was so predictable! The whole story could be used for an episode of any sitcom. Even the tv-like closing credits suggest that. It's certainly much better than Dumb and dumber, but then which movie isn't!!!! Oops! Sorry, I can't lie today!5",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Guilty for being so hilarious!,"This is one of the best comedy movies of the 90's. Carrey does a great performance as Fletcher Reede, and found himself in a twister full of real hilarity. Carrey finally gets rid of the ""Ace Ventura"" stereotype, and manages a more fine style of comedy. I watched it in two languages (Original English and Spanish Dubbing), and I just can't stop laughing. His character is trapped in a hole, because of his son's wish and fights his way to get out of it. In the end, it's basically a story of a father and a son, and the fragile balance of their relationship, damaged for the lies of the father. This is a must-have in the collection and it's not expensive. I personally recommend this movie to all you people reading this comment. Thanks for reading it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Jim Carrey at his BEST!!!!!,"Jim Carrey has always brought good movies for us to see and gave really good comedic performances. Liar Lair is another one of those performances where he does what he does best, which is slapstick comedy.He plays Fletcher Reede, a lawyer from a really big law firm and gets away with everything by telling a lie even to his own son and ex-wife Audrey. However, after he lies about being at his son's birthday party his son Max, makes a wish that his father couldn't tell a lie. After the candles go out, Fletcher can't tell a lie for 24 hours and what a riot it's going to bring.Lair Lair brings out the laughs and brings out the excitement that you would expect from a comedy. The performances from Jim Carrey, Maura Tierney, Jennifer Tilly, and the rest of the cast really does a good job at getting me to laugh.Jim Carrey should do more films like this, it's funny and he's always funny when he does comedy like this.A MUST-SEE FILM!!!! 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A movie that's funny and also has heart. Absolutely loved it. You will feel really good after watching this.The background score is nicely done. The characters are sweet and memorable. All of them have done a fantastic job, something I really found lacking in Yes Man and Ace Ventura.

Poor And Weak Film,I am not sure at all if I understand what the crew were thinking or trying to do when they were creating this poor and weak film. This film is confusing and disappointing and did not make any sense at all. The storyline of this film had no real direction at all and did not make any sense at all. The cast selection could have been a lot better and stronger. They did not at all commit nor connect to the storyline nor to their respective characters. There was not any sign of real chemistry at all displayed throughout this poor and weak film between the cast members. This poor and weak film should not have been created.,1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I've slipped into the seventh circle of HELL! Thank you.,"This is one of those movies that you can just watch over and over again and not stop enjoying it. It's filled with hilarious scenes, one great comedian, and one great director. This movie stars Jim Carrey in one of his best and funniest roles. Jim Carrey stars as Fletcher Reede, a lawyer who (obviously)lies his way to winning. But one day when he misses his son's 5th birthday, played very well by Justin Cooper, and with his father nowhere to be found he makes the wish that would change his fathers life,""I wish just for one day Dad couldn't tell a lie."" And that spins the story to comedy and disaster as Fletcher tries to win the case, without lying. This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, the comedy is fun and the story is great.

A Comedy Masterpiece,"In the pantheon of comedy classics, ""Liar Liar"" stands out as a beacon of unabashed hilarity and heartfelt charm. This film, directed by Tom Shadyac and starring the inimitable Jim Carrey, is often unjustly overlooked, meriting far more than its modest 6.9 rating on IMDb. Carrey, in one of his finest performances, plays Fletcher Reede, a lawyer cursed to speak nothing but the truth for 24 hours. This premise sets the stage for a series of comedic escapades that are both uproariously funny and touchingly human.What makes ""Liar Liar"" a standout is its magical storytelling woven with genuine emotional depth. At its core, this is a story about a father's love for his son and the lengths to which he will go to mend their relationship. The movie brilliantly balances over-the-top antics with moments of sincere tenderness, making it not just a film but an emotional journey.Jim Carrey's elastic facial expressions and perfect comic timing elevate the movie, turning what could have been a simple comedic sketch into a narrative filled with growth and redemption. ""Liar Liar"" is not merely a film but a heartfelt experience that deserves every bit of a perfect ten score. In this world of complex cinema, ""Liar Liar"" remains a reminder of what comedy can do: it can heal, it can unite, and most importantly, it can make us laugh till it hurts.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Fun film,"""Liar Liar"" (1997) is a professionally produced comedy about a habitual lying lawyer, Fletcher Reede played by Jim Carrey, who is forced to tell the truth for a period of 24 hours after his son, Max Reede played by Justin Cooper, makes a birthday wish. Every lie Fletcher has told begins to unfold in a highly energetic and trademark Carrey comedic way. I have admired Jim Carrey since ""In Living Color,"" and was always afraid his slap stick comedy wouldn't always transfer to the big screen, but this film was pinpoint perfect. His over-the-top antics effectively added to the film versus taking away. I enjoyed this film when I watched it the first time and enjoyed a bit of nostalgia this time.I am sure that Jim Carrey probably had much more to in his tank, but Tom Shadyac did an amazing job keeping Jim reeled in for this part. The overall acting was superb, even though it did feel that Jerry played by Cary Elwes was a bit ""too cheesy."" Even though this film isn't very realistic, at least as far as the wish coming true, the consequences would be very accurate in ""real life"" making the storyline immaculate because it has a real lesson, always tell the truth. I truly enjoy this film every time I watch it. I would recommend this film to all who need a good laugh with some genuine insight on how to approach life.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A very funny movie even if you are not a Jim Carrey fan you should enjoy.,"First off I would like to say I am not a Jim Carrey fan and in fact find him quite irritating in most of his movies i've seen. I could not sit through either of the Ace Ventura films or Dumb and Dumber.I watched this film having seen the trailer and thought the premise humorous. I have to say this film was hilarious, there were some really silly over the top parts (i.e the stairs beside the plane at the end, watch it to see what I mean !) but apart from these, the film was excellent. Carrey's rubber faced antics were very humorous, this is a must see for anyone who enjoys comedy.I am not really into comedys that much but this one really made me laugh.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

This is all light natured good fun, not mind bending or heavy.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hilarious ! (and one of Carrey 's best),"I am not a HUGE fan of Carrey . He did quite well in ""the Mask"" but I am really not a sucker for dum comedies with rubber-faced comedians (like Dumb and Dumber) . I also believed he was mediocre as the Riddler in Batman Forever and his stupid grimaces hurt quite a bit the ""Truman Show"" . This overacting was uncalled in Peter Weir 's film but what do we have here ? A solidly written comedy which really fits Carrey and gives him the chance to exploit his comedic talents but without being annoying . The result is (for the most part) amusing .OK lets recap the plot . Fletcher Reede (Carrey) is a successful lawyer who lies not only in courthouse but to everyone he knows including his colleaques and boss who he simply uses as a ladder for his career , his secretary whom he doesn 't give a raise , even his 5 year old son Max . Fletcher is divorced and Max lives with his mother Audrey (Maura Tierney) . Audrey divorced him because he didn 't invest much of his time to her but the problem still remains the same for Max . Fletcher is an absorbed workaholic and never finds time for his son (not even quality time that is). He keeps going back on his promises about picking up Max from school , playing baseball with Max etc , etc (If you have seen Hook with Robin Williams you already get the idea) . Audrey is fed up with Fletcher and has decided to move to Boston . Apparently Max will see his dad as frequently as now so she doesn 't have hesitations . Laura wants to start a new life with her new boyfriend Jerry . Jerry is a very ordinary calm little guy and although they are not officially engaged , they seem to be moving on tying the knot . At Max 's 5th birthday , Fletcher once again breaks his word and doesn 't arrive at the party . Max is so disappointed that the wish he makes blowing the candles on his cake is "" I wish that for 1 day my dad wouldn 't tell lies "" . The wish actually works and Fletcher is unable to spout (or even write!) even the simplest lie for the unbearable time course of 24 whole hours !!! The side effects are evident from the first moment since he reluctantly tells the truth to every question (and as the movie progresses we learn about other side effects due to this weird curse) . This is nearly the beginning for Fletcher 's torture since the truths embarrass him in front of the courtroom , his colleaques , his mother , his secretary and the police officer who checks his unpaid parking tickets !!!The premise was intriguing and Carrey is given free reign to spout the unpleasant truths in the most tragically funny way !! Carrey is superb in most of scenes like when he talks on the phone but he fails in others . One example is the scene with the pen which was badly staged . I would also like to complain about the scene where he beats his self up in the bathroom . It is totally unnecessary and at the worst case they should have at least shortened it . I especially liked the fact that the movie goes straight into action because the introductory scenes cover the first 10 or so minutes . Most of the consequences of Max 's wish are hilariously entertaining . The film is also short in order not to drag and be boring . Although it is inevitable that most of the viewers will simply focus on the gags and Carrey 's morphasms the writers pulled off some enjoyable messages . The satire on the profession of the lawyers is apparent . The usage and the benefit of lying in the ""adult world"" are also pointed out . As the plot unfolds we see Carrey actually redeeming his relationship with his fellow lawyers and his family even he was forced to outmouth bold and vulgar truths . For a family comedy Liar Liar actually contains a sensible amount of profanity although IMO it was used properly and rightfully "" I am gonna take it up to my tail pipe "" . If you have small children think twice before you let them see the film.Acting wise the team has done extremely well . This is not simply Carrey 's one man show - if it was it would fail . All the supporting characters chip in with their performances . Justin Cooper as Max plays convincingly the 5 year old character . Laura Tierney as Audrey is solid too . The show seems to be stolen by Jason Bernard as the strict Judge . He acts very well and is the nemesis of Carrey since if Fletcher embarrasses himself in court , the Judge 's wrath will be hard on him . Anne Haney is also a sensible supporting cast member as Greta , Fletcher 's secretary . She basically copycats her own role in ""Mrs Doudtfire"" (she was the social worker) but nevertheless with splendid results . She has more screen time and her constrained behavior is a hilarious opponent over Carrey 's fast and furious attitude . The rest of the cast is passable . Cary Elwes is literally unrecogniseable as Jerry , Audrey 's wannabe new husband . He appears briefly but is quite convincing in a very unusual for his standards buffoonish character .Liar , Liar is one of the most entertaining comedies of the 90 's . It is worth seeing even by non Carrey fans . For a fun evening with many laughs I recommend renting it.LIAR , LIAR 8 / 10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of Carrey's Best Roles...,"Jim Carrey does what he does best in LIAR,LIAR, a clever and amusing comedy about a divorced workaholic lawyer who keeps disappointing his young son to the point where, at his 5th birthday party, he makes a wish that his dad can't tell a lie for a whole day and the wish actually comes true, and losing the ability to lie turns out to seriously impede his chances of winning a big case. With the help of a smart script and sure-footed direction by Tom Shadyac, Carrey turns in one of his most entertaining performances as the poor sap has to avoid a whole lot of people who he didn't realize he lies to on a regular basis. There are some effective supporting turns from Maura Tierney as Carrey's ex, Jason Bernard as a judge, Anne Haney as his secretary, and especially Jennifer Tilly as his voluptuous client. Young Justin Cooper is adorable as Carrey's son,Max. This film also gets my vote for funniest outtakes shown during the closing credits...they're almost funnier than the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"This is, without a doubt, one of Jim Carrey's best films, and that's the truth. How does it hold up today?","""Liar Liar"" (1997), for those who may not know, Jim Carrey is one of my favorite comedy actors, and one of my all-time favorites in general. As a matter of fact, one of his movies; ""Bruce Almighty"" (2003), is one of my top ten favorite films of all-time! But, as far as his movies go, ""Liar Liar"" is a very close second for me as far as Jim Carrey films go. It's also one of my top ten all-time favorite comedy movies! ""Liar Liar"" has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and of course a perfect soundtrack to tie it all together. The plot is, a lawyer named Fletcher Reede is a compulsive liar, and his son's birthday wish is that he would go for 24 hours without telling a lie, which puts his job and relationship with his family in jeopardy. Right off the bat, the concept is absolutely hilarious. From what I've heard, most lawyers have reputations for lying. So, when you have a lawyer who cannot tell a lie, it's absolutely hysterical! It is an over-the-top story, but that's what makes it so funny. This film has a perfect balance of comedy, over-the-top moments and it even manages to throw in some nice heartwarming moments throughout. Talk about a perfectly balanced combination! It doesn't matter how many times I watch this movie, I will always laugh just as hard, if not harder whenever I do see it. I won't go into any details about the plot itself, but let me assure you all, it's a story that you'll remember forever. When you watch it, you'll be fully invested and laughing all the way through from beginning to end. It is truly, 86 minutes of comedic perfection. As for the acting, it's nothing short of sublime from the whole cast. The whole cast nails their respectable characters and then some! But, the shining star is Jim Carrey. He really makes this film shine! They could not have found a better actor to play the role of Fletcher Reede. Only Jim Carrey could've pulled off such an over-the-top character. He definitely succeeded on that part, and then some! The rest of the cast do just as great a job as well. They have such impeccable chemistry on the screen! Their performances make you care about the characters, and you want them to win at the end of the day. Not one cast member outshines the other, each character has their moments. Props to the casting agents! All of the sets/locations are perfect and really give this film a great atmosphere. You can't go wrong with filming your movie in Los Angeles! As for the special effects, they are all very well-done and still hold up to this day. Finally, the soundtrack composed by John Debney and James Newton-Howard is nothing short of exceptional. They're film score sets the perfect tone for the story and it really brings the movie to life. I've heard a lot of great film soundtracks from these two different composers. But, when they collaborate, magic is created for the soundtrack. Talk about a team-up! If I were to hear a few notes from the film score, I could immediately pinpoint it to this movie. That's the mark of a great soundtrack. Props to you, John Debney and James Newton-Howard! ""Liar Liar"" is nothing short of a fantastic comedy that keeps you hooked and laughing all the way through from beginning to end. Seriously, I could watch it over and over on repeat and not get tired of it! Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Liar Liar"" yet, and you enjoy comedy films, what are you waiting for? Go and check it out today. I promise that you'll love it! ""Liar Liar"" was the first Jim Carrey movie that I ever saw. It may not be my favorite of his films, but it's a very close second and it will always have a special place in my heart. Go and watch the movie today, you'll love it, that's the truth. If not, then you will never be able to tell a lie again!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Good. That's it.,"Another one of Jim Carrey's more recent works, LIAR LIAR wasn't as popular as some of his other early films, but this is a lot better than some of those.He keeps his trademark comic voice-variations, and juvenile crude humor which makes most parents not want their little kids to see it. Hey, it's just a movie!! Of course, I do know a little eleven-year old who knows literally every single word to this film! It's not even funny. I've seen this movie many times over and I recently watched it with him. He spoke every damn line of the film out...it was annoying!!!Anyway...if you liked this film, I recommend you see some of Carrey's other films that came after this one. ME, MYSELF & IRENE and THE GRINCH are probably good choices. BRUCE ALMIGHTY is another movie that seems like it would be a good recommendation. Either way, LIAR LIAR is one of Carrey's better works. He is just a naturally goofy guy, which in my opinion makes him a better character actor than Adam Sandler. See this movie. LIAR LIAR: 4/5.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

For once, Jim Carrey isn't just Jim Carrey, but a serious actor, and it is a nice supprice.

There is also an underlying morality -- that your kids are more important than money, that some things are just wrong no matter how much you benefit from them, that material success is no reflection of character -- that helps the film rise above the level of purile humor.Okay, so you don't get profundity.

One of Jim Carrey's Best Film,I like to watch every kind of movies and comedies and i saw this in theater when it first came out in year 1997. This film is one of the best comedies there is. Jim Carrey definitely proved his brilliance as comedian. He's the best comedian i know.Carrey plays a lawyer called Mr Reede and he's son Max wishes at his birthday party that he's father can't tell a lie for 24 hours. Reede's personal life starts changing. And he's taking Max he's son to the office and he promised to take son at wrestling but he lied. The part in the movie is really funny when he's at the elevator he came out in the office floor and everyone was ventilating with paper the bad air in there and Carrey said: it was me. Har Ha. it laughs every time.The acting is really good 8 points for that and 8 points for the movie. The side roles are good. I know Reede's boss is from Dharma And Greg TV series the Greg's father but don't remember he's actor name. I recommend this movie to all who likes a bit of comedy.,8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Jim Carrey's funniest film.,"Liar Liar tells the story of Fletcher Reede, a hotshot lawyer, father, and ex-husband with commitment issues. Every single time he promises something, he doesn't do it. After upsetting his 5 year old son, his son wishes that for just one day his father couldn't tell a lie. The wish comes true, and hilarity ensues as Fletcher struggles to lie himself out of situations when nothing but the truth can leave his lips. Liar Liar is a comedy with a message, and with Jim Carrey's hilarious style, the movie is a guaranteed fun time.Tom Shadyac and Jim Carrey apparently work really well together, because all of their pairings have been hilarious. This is a god comedy for Carrey because he's not playing a zany character like a pet detective, a dumb limo driver, or a superhero on steroids. No, instead he plays a normal every day guy. An intelligent lawyer who just doesn't make time for his son. Only when he can't spit out a simple lie, such as saying a blue pen is red, does the movie get truly hilarious. He suddenly finds everything he cares about crashing down around him because he can't lie, and Carrey's hilarious facial expressions and actions just amplify the already funny situation. The fact that the movie makes several jabs at the lawyer profession and that the movie actually has a message behind it makes it a better comedy than most.I am a huge Jim Carrey fan. Have been ever since I first saw him in Ace Ventura. His movies of late haven't been all that satisfying, but I can always turn to Liar Liar to make me laugh. Most comedies are funny for the first two times you watch it, but afterward they become dry. As for Liar Liar, it keeps me laughing every time. Overall, it's a really good comedy that I think most people will enjoy.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Heart-warming yet funny movie!,"At his fifth birthday party Max (Justin Cooper) makes a wish that for just one day his inattentive father Fletcher (Jim Carrey) will be unable to tell a lie. Miraculously the wish comes true which causes countless problems for Fletcher whose job as a lawyer may be in jeopardy unless he is able to lie.Director Tom Shadyac teams up with Jim Carrey for the first time since the hilarious Ace Ventura: Pet Detective' (1994) and while one may expect more of the same, Liar Liar' benefits somewhat from having a tighter and heart-warming story rather than just the usual Carrey hijinks. The rubber-faced comic master Jim Carrey is at his best for this movie and while his off the wall antics provide seemingly endless humour, it is the poignant and touching scenes towards the end that really stand out in my opinion and prove Carrey's incredible acting ability. Once again Carrey steals the show but strong performances from Jennifer Tilly and Maura Tierney allow Carrey's natural comic ability to bounce around during the movie and makes for some humorous scenes in which Carrey was not involved.Credit should be given to writers Paul Guay and Stephen Mazur who managed to create an accomplished for Carrey to feed off, and feed off it he did. The screenplay is fairly tight and, despite a few plot problems, allows for a heart-warming story to be told despite the often complete lunacy being portrayed. The relationships between Max, Audrey (Tierney) and Fletcher are shown to the viewer in an almost profound and meaningful way. Despite Justin Cooper's limited acting abilities (though considering his age one can hardly expect an Oscar-winning performance!) the viewer is made to feel sorry for Max because of all the hurt he has felt in his relatively short life so far.As with most Carrey films there will be people who just do not find Carrey's unique brand of humour funny. The jokes are generally more mature than earlier films such as Ace Ventura: Pet Detective' (1994) and Dumb & Dumber' (1995) which might impress those who were less than impressed with the often infantile humour found in his earlier films but still might not be enough to make an impact on the non-Carrey fans. Personally I feel that Liar Liar' is Carrey's finest work to date which benefits from Carrey's bizarre behaviour, an enjoyably talented supporting cast and a strong script featuring some great gags, witty one-liners and a heart-warming story. My rating for Liar Liar'  8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Likeable Carrey Vehicle Bogged Down by Schmaltz,"Liar Liar, Jim Carrey's return to comedy that made him a star (after audiences failed to appreciate his bitingly dark turn in 1996's The Cable Guy) finds him as a habitual liar/lawyer whose son decides to wish his father can tell nothing but the truth for an entire day.Carrey, as usual, turns in an all-out, body-flailing, mugging, and excruciatingly hilarious performance.  His comedic timing is impeccable, his physical antics singularly unique, and he constantly proves to be an inventively outrageous comic actor.  We can sympathize with his inability to lie as well, as we realize that we all lie to some extent.With such a big focus and so much more attention put on Carrey's dilemma, however, the rest of the cast is overshadowed.  Maura Tierney and Carrey Elwes' relationship isn't really too believable and Carrey's relationship with son Justin Cooper really feels tacked on at times.  While the film is certainly more accessible to a much wider age-range than some other of Carrey's crude, ill-spirited brand of humor, the family-film element brings down this movie.  This obviously isn't a family type film, so why bog it down with such a subplot?  Jennifer Tilly, on the other hand, fares well in her thinly-scripted role.Besides the sometimes schmaltzy familial moments, Liar Liar is a much more likeable, restrained second collaboration between Carrey and director Tom Shadyac.  Newcomers to Carrey's brand of comedy will be pleased, as he isn't out-and-out crude and is generally likeable; die-hard Carrey fans might ask why he's not out of control.  Overall, however, a very enjoyable, light-hearted comedy.7 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Jim Carrey At His Best,"By the time Jim Carrey did Liar Liar, he had already cemented his status as a comedy legend with Dumb and Dumber, Ace Ventura and The Mask, all of which came out 3 years earlier.
In Liar Liar, Jim Carrey plays Fletcher Reede, a workaholic deadbeat father with a terrible habit of lying. After letting his son Max down one too many times, Max uses a birthday wish to wish that, for a 24 hour period, his father would be incapable of lying.
What happens is a slice of comedic genius that only Jim Carrey could pull off. It's the epitome of hilarity, endlessly quotable and a true comedy classic, showcasing Jim Carrey in his prime. It's the funniest of all the films he ever did and, with a stellar supporting cast to back the project up, it's a delight from beginning to end.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Nothing Stops the Claw!!,"See it because it is excellent because it is very funny, Jim Carrey makes a lot of laughs, it is very funny and entertaining from the beginning to the end.

I do not understand how they can speak ill of ""Liar Liar"" if it's excellent, not only makes of a liar father but makes of a liar and crazy father who works like lawyer, I die of laughter the funny things that does Jim Carrey in this movie but it's a bit exaggerated like when he hits with the toilet lid in the bathroom and a gentleman who does not understand it looks at him.The ending phrase ""Nothing stops the claw!""

My absolute favorite quote of this film is, ""I'm kicking my a**! Do you mind?"" I was really touched when Fletcher told Max (Justin Cooper) that he was hurting emotionally, played with him, and hugged him. The part I really like is when Fletcher and Dana (Swoosie Kurtz) call each other names. It was funny during the movie as well as during the credits.

Carrey is the main reason this movie works,"My Rating: *** out of ****.If you are not a fan of Jim Carrey, then watch Liar Liar. I almost promise you that you will become a fan. In terms of his comedic performances, Carrey is at his absolute best here.I have this feeling that without Carrey here the film would not be much. The script is uneven. The writing for the comedy part is good and made atleast ten times as better because of Carrey's performance. However, the dramatic part is average writing at best and Carrey is no better than ok in those scenes.So if Carrey is not as good in the dramatic scenes is his performance uneven? A little but the dramatic scenes mean nothing when he is beating himself in the bathroom which is just one of several hilarious scenes. Its a shame to see how Carrey's comedic talents have gone down recently. If you want to see what I am talking about check out Bruce Almighty.In terms of supporting performances, everyone does an adequate job. There are no standouts though. Jennifer Tilly looks great but does not make her character memorable. Actually, maybe the woman who plays Carrey's secretary (I forget her name) is a standout because she is actually quite good for limited screentime.I recommend Liar Liar for anyone who just wants to watch an entertaining movie. Its not a great film but you certainly won't be bored. But really, if you take away Carrey, this would be a rather mediocre film.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Great Comedy,"This has to be Jim Carrey's best. One of the best comedies I've seen since the first half of ""Stir Crazy"". Jim Carrey is a slippery lawyer who plays fast and loose with the truth. When his son innocently makes a wish that his father would stop lying, suddenly Carrey's lawyer character finds he cannot say anything BUT the truth. Suddenly clients, judges, opposing counsel start hearing his shady thought processes. Even a large breasted woman in an elevator gets the stream-of-consciousness routine, with predictable results. Every inane, ridiculous, embarrassing thing that goes through his head, suddenly starts coming out of his mouth, at the most inopportune times. Many laugh-out-loud moments.

Wrong hand?,"I love ""Liar, Liar"" - I have to admit it's a guilty pleasure and one of my favorite Jim Carrey movies! There are so many memorable scenes and quotes. But I've read over the comments and the goofs and haven't noticed anyone mention the faux pas I noticed in the scene where he's in his office, trying to lie about what color the pen is. He takes the pen (and writes with it) with his RIGHT hand. Jim Carrey is left-handed ... at least according to what I've read. I wonder if this is a goof or filmed that way because of camera angles or whether he's just ambidextrous. Since I'm left-handed myself, I tend to notice when actors are also lefties. Anyway, I know it sounds nit-picky, but if anyone knows the answer - I'd appreciate a comment back.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Carrey At His Finest, Writing Not So Much","Some movies start with a great idea from a great script. Others just need a visionary director or a star actor to build around. And then there is Jim Carrey, who is so singular, so charismatic, and so effortlessly funny that not only can you build a whole movie around him, but you can build several. From Ace Ventura (1994) to Bruce Almighty (2003) and many more in between, Carrey has built an empire of modern slapstick. He was one of the kings of comedy from the start of the 1990s and for more than a decade made us laugh with his idiosyncratic facial expressions and voices. Perhaps no film better exemplifies his style than 1997s Liar Liar, which could very well have just started with the question ""What if Jim Carrey?""Hire some extras, get a camera, and call Jim Carrey to stand in front of it and you are bound to produce something magical. There are few actors that really possess the ability to just make comedy happen spontaneously. Robin Williams, Eric Idle, Will Ferrell are names that come to mind. But Carrey is surely one of, if not the best at it. You could forget every other character and plot point in this movie, but by the time the credits roll, you will know that Jim Carrey made you laugh uncontrollably with his wacky antics.So, what is this movie actually about? Fletcher Reede (Carrey) is a lawyer with a wife and child who he lightly neglects and sometimes lies to. One day, his child makes a wish and through an unexplained force, the wish comes true. That wish is that Fletcher will stop lying, and through this wish Fletcher learns the benefits of truthfulness and spending time with his family.This plot is, to put it lightly, dull. It lacks anything transformative, anything new. It is a formulaic script with a deus ex machina plot progression and a cliche ending where everyone lives happily ever after (except the new boyfriend). If you put that on the table of any studio, I'm sure you would be quickly escorted to the door and barred from ever returning. However, get out your stamp and your red ink and plaster in giant bold letters across the front page ""JIM CARREY"" and you have yourself a real script to be excited about.For the first twenty or so minutes of the film, we get a straight up cornucopia of classic Carrey gags, faces, expressions, accents and noises. He basically has free reign to do whatever crazy thing comes to mind. You can tell by watching some of the bloopers that he is simply improvising much of the scenes, which makes absolute sense. Most of the things he does couldn't be written in a script, let alone expressed succinctly in words. If you had never seen a Carrey movie before, this would be a great place to start to get the idea of what he is capable of as an actor and what his style is.Once the audience has been fully saturated with the ridiculousness of Jim Carrey in those first twenty minutes, along with some mild plot points to get us to the next act, we get the sappy emotional twist and character progression that we always need in a family movie. Fletcher slowly begins to learn the error of his ways and in a span of just a few short days, is able to reconcile with his problems and see the path towards happiness and emotional health. It's all a little bit too easy, but what did you expect? A sad ending? The final act is more than expected. Fletcher makes it up to his wife and a lifetime of lies and deceit is forgiven in just a few minutes. We even get a dramatic airport runway scene which we sadly will never get to see again in a post 9/11 world.This movie more or less serves one purpose: to be a showcase to the acting prowess of Jim Carrey. And that's really all it needed to be. This movie came out directly after Ace Ventura (1994), The Mask (1994) and The Cable Guy (1996) when Carrey was the powerhouse of comedy, and before he tried to dabble more into serious roles like Man on the Moon (1999) and the Truman Show (1998). It was always bound to succeed, and by making back its budget six times over, it did just that. It is a hilarious romp, and nothing you need to take too seriously. Just sit back, have fun and enjoy the insanity that is Jim Carrey.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Evokes a gleeful, childlike anticipation","Tom Shadyac and Jim Carrey capitalized on the funny man's recent success with this somewhat more family friendly comedy. Carrey plays an unscrupulous lawyer whose 6-year-old son is disappointed by his father time and time again and ultimately makes a birthday wish that his dad won't be able to lie for a whole day. It's a simple premise of classic proportions which is brilliantly suited for Carrey's rubber-face antics and magnificent physical comedy. And thanks to funny bits of writing from Shadyac (and an uncredited Steve Oedekerk) the team were able to make the most of it. When Carrey walks around in the stiff, unforgiving world of law firms and courtrooms having to tell the truth about his observations on various despicable characters and his own selfishness and shortcomings, you're watching with a gleeful, childlike anticipation. It's Carrey's gift to be able to say and do these things without coming off as annoying or boorish. And in Liar Liar, we even get a portion of warmth and sensitivity to boot.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Classic Comedy!,"Liar Liar is one of those comedies that make your stomach hurt no matter when it's watched. Whether you were a person who saw it in 1997 or if you're seeing it for the first time in 2010, this movie includes a whopper list of gut-wrenching jokes along with Jim's best performance.Fletcher (Jim Carrey) is a lawyer who's career currently hinges on a case that requires him to lie, but when his son Max gets upset for the last time (after Fletcher misses Max's birthday), Max puts a curse on his dad where he can't lie for 24 hours.On a wild adventure of watching Fletcher try to lie when he clearly can't, we're forced into watching the overacting of Carrey but it's needed for the comedic effect to be priceless. A long list of supporting actors help draw out the big laughs and make the film that much memorable.I really enjoy Liar Liar even thirteen years after it's release. I think that a comedy like this, it's jokes are timeless giving it the ability to make you laugh no matter it's release. It's not just a funny film, but inspiring and emotional.

A distillation what made family entertainment so endearing in the 90s.,"The second of what was ultimately three collaborations between actor Jim Carrey and director Tom Shadyac, Liar Liar sits comfortably between Ace Ventura and Bruce Almighty as a distillation of what made family entertainment so endearing in the 90s; just appropriate enough for kids, but not appropriate enough that their parents wouldn't be entertained either.A genius twist on the legal drama, Liar Liar sees Carrey's lawyer Fletcher Reed representing his firm in a high-stakes case wherein success is wholly dependent on his penchant for manipulating the truth. Unbeknownst to Fletcher, however, is that his son Max - tired of his father's broken promises - has made a birthday wish preventing Fletcher from telling a lie for one whole day. Hilarity ensures as Fletcher must find a way to either undo the effects of the wish, or identify a way to win the case legitimately.Watching the court case unravel - and Fletcher's attempts to stall it - is both genuinely funny and interesting. Shadyac manages to balance Carrey's often tiresome brand of comedy with the intrigue of a courtroom drama and the pathos of the morally-centred family films for which the decade is known. Carey Elwes is an effectively annoying foil to Fletcher's attempts to win back his family, and Jennifer Tilly is hilariously playful as Fletcher's promiscuous client. The third act culminates in a surprising, riveting climax which Legally Blonde would borrow four years later to even greater effect.A major success in its initial release, it remains surprising that Liar Liar managed to evade the franchising that often ran its brethren into the ground with numerous sequels. As it stands, Liar Liar remains a laugh-a-minute stand-alone effort, and a cautionary tale for anyone who has ever let their little white lies run away with themselves.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Destined to be a comedy classic (If it isn't one already).,"While this movie isn't the newest movie out in the video store, it will undoubtedly one day become a comedy classic. While the plot was a little thin, at first viewing, you can't tell, because Carrey's skills on ""winging it"" are so good. Basically, comedy doesn't get much better than this, unless someone at Universal puts together an R Rated Director's Cut with the complete out-take reel, then it would be better (and probably much funnier). On the scale of Buy It, Rent It, or Skip It, this movie gets a well deserved Buy It.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Love this flick!,"Tom Shadyac, director of 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective' and 'The Nutty Professor', teams up with Jim Carrey to make a brilliantly funny comedy about a man that cannot lie. Heart-warming family film about a young boy who wishes that his father cannot lie for an entire day! The results are hilarious with Jim Carrey perfectly portraying comedic skill to convey the tormented lawyer Fletcher Reede who is unable to lie. Jim Carrey fans will appreciate this film as one of his funniest and non-fans should find this one of the easiest Carrey films to enjoy. Underneath all the side-splitting laughs and family sentimentality, there is also a clever morality play within this film. I wholeheartedly recommend this movie. 'Liar Liar' scores a solid **** out of *****!",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Brilliant script,"What made this a surprisingly entertaining film for me was the script, which was tight, well-structured and ultimately profound in its approach and theme. Jim Carrey's character fell constantly into subtext, the text entirely ripped away leaving him bleeding and vulnerable beneath. Carrey's performance, which was like Donald O'Connor on speed, was brilliant in its invention. That he obviously (on the basis of the cuts at the end) improvised much of the performance proves him to be a far better comedian and actor than I'd given him credit for.My only gripe is that it had, inevitably, to degenerate into Hollywood sentimentality. But at least they didn't cast Robin Williams.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Jim Carrey, like Holmes, cannot make bricks without clay.","I'm not a huge Jim Carrey fan; to me, he's better in movies like ""Dumb and Dumber"", when he doesn't rearrange his facial features every two minutes. In ""Liar Liar"", he tries too hard, perhaps to make up for the one-dimensional characterization and plot.  I've seen Sprite commercials with more depth than this movie.  Not worth the hype, and with an ending that makes me yearn for the subtle resolution of ""Die Hard.""",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hilarious and touching at the same time.,"I have to say I very much disagree with the notion that this film is ""Ace Ventura"" retread.  Yes, it's a perfect showcase for Mr. Carrey's comedic talents, but it's also the first time I witnessed his ability to really act, in a (slightly) dramatic capacity.  This is most evident in the scenes with his ""son"", and in a pivotal courtroom scene where Fletcher chooses morality over greed, at a personal cost.  It's always hard to balance broad comedy with poignancy, but this film does it well, I think.  You really care whether he loses his son or redeems himself.  This was the beginning of truly great things for Jim Carrey.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A waste of resources and cast,"This film made money? The basic idea is good but the treatment is well over the top;fascinating in its dreadfulness. I almost smiled - once. It was impossible to be feel involved with these characters (liked the secretary, though). Even the promising ending was spoiled by the reruns of the worst bits. I had liked Carrey in The Mask and The Truman Show so it's disappointing to feel like this.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Jim Carrey turns honest,"I recently saw this movie for the first time on ABC.  I thought it was funny.  In the movie, Jim Carrey plays Fletcher Reed, a divorced lawyer whose son named Max wishes that he could tell nothing but the truth for just one day.  Well the wish comes true.  Unfortunately for Fletcher it causes a lot of problems.  He can no longer keep secrets, which causes him to embarass himself.  For example, he tells a woman in the park just exactly what he thinks of her and she slaps him.  Later, his son, ex-wife, and her future husband are on their way to Boston.  Good old Fletcher comes to stop them with some comic tactics like hiding in a suitcase and using some wheelstairs to take him to the departing airplane.  Eventually, a bunch of luggage falls on him leaving him injured.  Max, ex-wife, and the future husband come out of the plane.  Fletcher tells his son just how much he wishes he could've spent time with him but was just too busy with his job to do so.  The mother asks him if he really means it. Max says, ""Of course, mom, he has to tell the truth!""  Reed tells Max that the wish wore off and things are back to normal.  At Max's next birthday, the lights temporarily go off and when they turn on again, Reed and his ex-wife are kissing.  Reed asks Max if he wished for them to get back together.  Max says, ""No,dad, I wished for some new rollerblades!""  This is a wonderful movie that everyone should watch.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A true classic!,"This has to be one of the best comedies of all time. Jim Carrey is outstanding for his role. They couldn't of chosen a better person to do the role. This movie has a hilarious plot, great acting, and a good set of main characters. Justin Cooper is good at playing his son, because his acting was credible as a son from my point of view. The plot is simply this. Max (Cooper) is having his 5th birthday. His dad (Carrey) always lies to him when he promises him something. It turns out that Jim Carrey, by the name of Fletcher Reede, turns out to be an attorney. He has three jobs being an attorney: To protect people's rights, try to win every case, and to tell the truth! Telling the truth is something he doesn't do successfully especially when it comes to his son, Max. When Max is celebrating his 5th birthday at his party he is crushed because his father didn't show up after he promised to show up. When his mother tells him to make a wish he says, ""I wish just for one day that dad couldn't tell a lie."" The wish miraculously comes true at 8:15 p.m. This is very bad for Fletcher because he has a very big case to work on and he has to lie so he can win the case. He'll soon discover that winning a case isn't as important as his son.Anyways Liar Liar is a great movie and is a classic in my shelf. My favorite scenes would have to be the elevator scene, the blue pen, the scene of Mr. Allen's meeting and the bathroom scene. It's just one of the best comedies of all time.  Liar Liar gets a 10/10.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Like the sun, piercing the mist of a thousand nights; Like the single insignificant star floating obliviously through the universe...","Another superb American comedy from the producers of the Eddie Murphy classic - ""The Nutty Professor"", which similarly takes a look at the main character's profession and twists it around until their situation nearly ruins their life until it all expectedly comes to a much anticipated conclusion where boy gets girl, (or man gets woman) and happy endings are for all. Despite the corny structure, the unending comedy and various side-splitting Carrey-faces makes this film a hit for all the family.Set in the traditional US courtroom, the film is centred around a lousy, lying Jim Carrey (Fletcher) trying to change his way of life - to devote himself to his son. However, his efforts fail and a desperate Max (Fletcher's son) makes a birthday wish, in which his father cannot tell a lie for 24 hoursone of those day curses. The overall setting of the film seems quite contemporary, apart from the single mild action scene at the airport.The editing of the film is not too radical or energetic, and the camera angles are not too impressive, however the viewer's attention is kept focussed on the storyline and fantastic comedy which will keep the viewer chuckling for days afterward.The great acting of Jim Carrey, Maura Tierney, (Fletcher's Ex Audrey), Justin Cooper, (Max), and Cary Elwes, (Audrey's Boyfriend) all seamlessly blend in and intertwine into a smooth, comprehensible comedy which is pleasing to the senses.Altogether, the pleasant orchestral music, pace and often memorable dialogue make Liar Liar a laugh from start to finish. Even when the movie ends, the screw-ups during production are presented, overemphasising how much comedy is a part of this classic. This unmissable film can really only be topped by the likes of The Mask or The Truman Show or Me, Myself and Irenewatch now.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
You'll laugh your a@% off!,"I loved this movie!!  Non-stop funniness(?), slapstick at its absolute BEST!!!

But this movie was conceived, nurtured, executed, and made alive for the Man himself! Noone-I mean NOONE- could've pulled this character off except Carrey.

I've gone on to see this movie 5 or 6 times and it still manages to make me laugh my head off! The only disappointment is the ending, which I thought was too far fetched and bordering on being ludicrous. But everything else just seems perfect.

Of course, you've ALWAYS had better, and this is only one example of how the curse of truth-telling provides opportunities for embarrassment and a slap in the face for Jimbo, and much hilarity for the viewing classes like meself.This is a great flick.

Yet another great visual treat for the Jim Carrey fans...,"It's a simple storyline : Fletcher Reede (Jim Carrey) is a lawyer by profession and liar by nature. Problem arises when his wife, Audrey (Maura Tierney) threatens to desert him alongwith his son, Max (Justin Cooper) and live with her boyfriend of college days Jerry (Cary Elwes). The reason for this being Fletcher's repeatedly false commitments to Audrey and Max, who get emotionally hurt every now and then due to this. The story gets a beautiful turn when Max on his 5th birthday makes a wish that his daddy would'nt lie for one whole day and as expected this wish comes true and thus Jim Carrey gets an opportunity to show his acting skills and yet again he gives a flawless performance as a comic actor. The ending is expected with Fletcher getting united with his family and rediscovering himself as a good father and moreover a truthful person.This is yet another visual treat for the countless Jim Carrey fans who have enjoyed him in films like ACE VENTURA: PET DETECTIVE, DUMB AND DUMBER, THE MASK ...No amount of praise is sufficient to acknowledge his comic skills. It comes so naturally to him. The whole movie seems like a roller coaster ride with Jim Carrey giving you reasons to laugh like hell at many moments and then changing into an emotional person occasionally (though that makes you laugh even more !!!). I would claim it to be a MUST WATCH MOVIE. You can blame me to be a hardcore Jim Carrey fan or being partial towards him but every Jim movie portrays in it the versatility the actor possesses which is so rare nowadays..... He gives everybody a reason to smile (rather i should say LAUGH!!! that too like MAD... )I would rate it 9 on a scale of 10.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

If you don't like Jim Carrey, you'll probably think that the humour is weak, and the ""How much SHOULD you lie/father-son relationship""- theme is too Hollywood-happy and clichèed, so I wouldn't recommend it to you guys.

Not to say that he's really emotional or that this movie will make people that hate him think that he's one of the greats of all time.

Darning with faint praise,"""Liar Liar"" is an example of what happens when great comedy goes good--it gets ignored.  Liar Liar is a good-hearted comedy that nobody seems to take too seriously.  Sure, it's very funny, but if nobody's feelings get hurt (apart from trial lawyers) it can't be ""great"" comedy, can it?  Did anyone mention that this is Jim Carrey's funniest performance on film?  Okay--I will.In Liar Liar Jim Carrey plays a lawyer who is a compulsive liar, which makes him an attorney with a bright future.  When the lying spills into his personal life, his son Max makes a birthday wish that for just one day his father will be unable to speak a lie.The wish comes true, and Jim Carrey delivers a career-topping performance as a scheming lawyer who craves the chance to lie but just can't get the words out of his mouth.  Watching Carrey contort and fume in the angst of a jerk who would rather bash his own head in than tell the truth, you see an early Jerry Lewis, the deft interplay of soulfulness and belly laughs.  Carrey's character is not a clown or buffoon, he's a real guy who's let his own ego run away with him.  And his comeupance isn't a public pillorying, it's just an hilarious struggle between good and evil within the tortured soul of a trial lawyer.  And since it's Jim Carrey, there's plenty of yuk-yuks.Jim Carrey's choices of roles show that he desires to be taken seriously as an actor.  Very well, but let's not forget to take him seriously as a comedian, the greatest of our time.  Liar Liar shows Carrey's performing at his wackiest and most tenderly felt.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not impressed...,"The movie was not that impressive. Jim Carrey's character was such a lowlife cad that he did not get any sympathy for his well deserved distress.The only ones who may see some light at the end of this dark tunnel of a movie are those individuals who have Carrey's traits and are hoping for a second chance. The only individual I felt any emotion for was the husband of Jennifer Tilly who was royally screwed over although he did nothing wrong but love his wife and children. The sad part was the fact that no one felt any sympathy for him and in fact cheered his downfall. The overlying theme of the movie seemed to be that no one is reponsible for their actions. Carrey did all the dirt and came out smelling like a rose, getting everything he wanted. His ex-wife's boyfriend who cared about her got nothing. The loving husband got destroyed and lost his children. The cheating wife got everything she wanted and more. So in this movie the good got cheated, the bad got rewarded, and everyone else got ignored. Not a good movie.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Carrey at best!,"Liar Liar is a movie where son of a very dishonest and liar lawyer wishes some honesty for his father when his father misses his birthday party. And his wish magically becomes true. But it is not spells and magic we see in the movie, it is pure comedy!One can say Carrey was great in Ace Ventura movies, or in Mask, or in Dumb and Dumber. I do agree that they are also good comedies that amuses the audience but in this one Carrey is not playing a uber maniac character like Ace Ventura, or a super natural freak with green face, or an idiot. The character he portrays is not unique, but I am sure there are plenty of such lawyers... Now I don't mean all lawyers are like this but in some cases you really admit that guy should be hell of a liar to sort that one out!I don't say that the movie is ""completely"" great... I mean, when you say comedy nobody wishes to watch the beginning or scenes about Max or his mother but Carrey. Beating himself in the bathroom, or his failing attempts to lie, and that scene in the meeting room... Oh my god!Liar Liar is a movie where one can watch the real talent of Carrey, as nowadays he mostly prefers ""simpler"" characters (His try in Bruce Almighty was not as good as this) Strongly recommended.

Jim at his best,"Liar Liar may not be a new movie, but it's definitely one of those comically genius films that you just can't pass up. So, I want to review this movie for anyone who may have overlooked this flick when it first came out. If you did, you missed a real treat.Tom Shadyac whom you may remember from movies like Patch Adams, The Nutty Professor, and Ace Ventura directed this comedy. You know this guy has had some experience in comedies. He directed the movie that gave Jim Carrey his big break as the notorious Ace Ventura. The main characters are Fletcher (Jim Carrey), Max (Justin Cooper), and Audrey (Maura Tierney). They all have impressive acting talent that is displayed brilliantly throughout this film.The plot goes something like this: Jim Carrey plays the part of Fletcher, a lawyer and failing father who deals with the recent divorce of Audrey, played by Maura Tierney. Fletcher gets the biggest case of his career, but his son Max makes a wish on his birthday that his dad couldn't tell a lie for a whole day. It comes true of course. Well, that turns Fletcher's world upside down, as you can imagine, because he is a scumbag lawyer who makes a living at lying. The whole movie takes over a period of just two or three days of him dealing with the fact that he can't lie.The storyline is totally original and well thought out. I 'busted a gut' laughing, and this movie didn't give me very many breaks in between bursts of tear jerking laughter. Jim Carrey was the absolute best actor for the part as the untruthful lawyer. I don't see how anyone else could physically match Jim Carrey's comically genius body language. It all seems to come naturally to him. He probably acts like that in real everyday life. This would have to be one of, if not the best, Jim Carrey Movie.That's enough about Carrey. Justin Cooper is a young kid who does a surprisingly good job of playing the cute little five-year-old son. You kind of feel sorry for the little guy when his dad stands him up on his birthday when he ""promised"" to be there. Maura Tierney's character (Audrey) is very natural. She can make you feel that she is a real person compared to her totally opposite and whacked ex-husband. Audrey's dorky boyfriend does a good job at being, well, a dork. By the time you are introduced to this character you really start to hate him, but that's what the director wants you to do. The screenplay and sound are very well done and extremely comical. The words slip off Jim Carrey's lips as easily as anything. The way he carries himself throughout the film makes you wonder if he wasn't some kind of monkey in a past life. I can't tell you how many times he falls over in this movie! He'll have you saying catchy lines like ""It was me!"" and ""That's just something ugly people say"". Or maybe you would like this line: ""Here goes, I sped, I followed too closely, I ran a stop sign, I almost hit a Chevy, I sped some more, I failed to yield at a crosswalk, I changed lanes at a crosswalk, I changed lanes without signaling, while running a red light and speeding!"" or maybe not.There are many great scenes in this movie so it's hard to pick a favorite. I would have to say that my absolute 'fave' would have to be the witty scene where he tries to lie and say that the pen is red when it is actually blue. I can't describe in words how funny that scene was but just the way that he screams ""The pen isBluuuee!!"" is just hilarious. There are practically no special effects in Liar Liar  but there are many outrageous stunts performed in Jim Carrey's place. I was surprised at all the stunt doubles I saw in the titles at the end of the movie.I really liked this movie a lot and it will be on my classic comedy list from now on. The only faulty part of the movie is the bad or crass language used in various parts of the flick. It's not over the edge with cursing in every other sentence but it does bother me a bit.This movie even has a strong moral to it. Lying to just get yourself ahead in life hurts others and will eventually catch up and hurt you. In one scene Fletcher is practicing the witness interview with his client and the client says something like, Oh, all we have to do is lie, that's easy. Then he realizes that what they are doing is wrong, and he can't ask the question if he knows it's a lie. Throughout the movie Fletcher learns a major lesson in dealing with life, and goes through a major morality change. I really liked how the movie sticks that moral issue in and makes you think. 'Cuz' a little white lie is the same as a big whoper if you think about it.If you can get over the language and get to the core of this awesome movie I think you would love it, except for you strange few who don't like Jim Carrey. (You know who you are!) Maybe you should give him another try, I promise you will enjoy yourself.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

Skip the beginning and the end,"...and just watch the middle part of the film, the part where Jim Carrey's character (Fletcher Reede) can't lie. Fortunately, that's most of the film.The main plot involving Fletcher's relationship with his ex-wife and young son is dull and mostly devoid of laughs. Maura Tierney has a few moments, but the family seemed to have been tacked on to provide a premise to the punchline of Jim Carrey not being able to lie.The subplots involving Fletcher's work are far more entertaining. He's forced to deal with an embittered secretary, a back-stabbing harlot coworker, a husky-voiced, promiscuous client (Jennifer Tilly), an unsympathetic judge, a boardroom full of stuffy superiors, and a lawsuit so ridiculous that F. Lee Bailey wouldn't touch it -- all while he can't lie, of course.Liar Liar would have been better if the family got the axe, and it were made entirely about Carrey's problems at work. But it was still pretty good, a definite hit after a couple misses (Batman Forever and The Cable Guy, plus maybe Dumb and Dumber).RATING: 7 of 10.

I've always been amazed at the things he can do with his face as well as his hyperactivity. In addition, the things he will do to himself in the bathroom scene in the courthouse as I found out no sound effects were used in that scene where he's actually slamming his head and body into walls, the radiator heater as ell as the toilet seat.If there are any drawbacks, Jim Carrey tends to overact a bit, but he's someone who can do it and get away with it.Jennifer TIlly's character, Samantha Cole, Fletcher's client was good, but this was different to me as she plays an evil person who wants to take her ex-husband to ""the cleaners"" in the divorce. I best remember her as Vicki in ""Let it Ride"".At the end, when the credits are rolled, various outtakes are shown and they are worth watching, as he's up to his usual craziness and even a prank is pulled on him.After this movie was released; In some ways, this became the end of Jim Carrey as we know him (ie: Ace Ventura, Lloyd Christmas and The Cable Guy)as he started to take on different types of roles.This is a movie worth adding to your DVD library.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Funny, likeable film with sweet moments","One of those rare instances where Jim Carey plays a likeable character, Fletcher is a playful, loving father but is so tired up with his work that he often ends up breaking promises he makes to his son, which ends up hurting them both. When his son makes a wish during his birthday after his father had broken yet ANOTHER promise (or lied), the wish is that his dad will never tell another lie again. Of course, this comes true, and you have the plot, which leads to hilarious moments, AND, for those of you who want action, an action scene at the airport that would make Steve McQueen proud! I highly recommend this movie to basically anyone. I'm not a big fan of Jim Carey but this was his best in my opinion.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good AMERICAN fun!  Carrey's finest performance to date.,"Jim Carrey gives what may be his finest performance to date (save for ""The Cable Guy"", which runs a close second) in ""Liar Liar"".  Absolutely a movie that requires no thought processes whatsoever, it showcases both Carrey's unique abilities of physical contortion/distortion and his range of emotions.  Particularly memorable is a courtroom scene where he holds himself in contempt!  There are strong supporters in the cast--Cary Elwes as a nauseatingly nice guy competing for his son's affection, Cheri Oteri as a secretary at his law firm, and Swoosie Kurtz as his courtroom nemesis. Carrey is a unique talent and this movie showcases his abilities better than any before it.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Enjoy it Moment to Moment.,"To enjoy this movie, don't be intelligent or deep or attempt to look for meaning. (Critics, please leave the room immediately!) Instead, just enjoy it moment to moment -- the one liners, the silly faces and the silly noises, all nicely woven into the fabric of easily digestible and time proven wholesome Hollywood themes.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Stupid, so what?","Let's just forget the scenario (a lawyer forced to tell the truth) and all those futile stuff ;-), this is just the kind of movie that was made for Jim Carrey and no one else. Well, I can't deny it, it's damn stupid, but who cares? Jim Carrey has an outstanding talent, whatever people says (just watch ""Man On The Moon"" over and over again, or more recently ""Me, Myself And Irene""), and only he can make these kind of characters look real. It's funny, even if less than some of his other films. So why asking more?",,Anonymous,Fantasy
