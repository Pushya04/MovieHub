"In retrospect, we were all too hard on this film","If you're a Millennial like me, you probably experienced the phenomena known as 'Titanic-mania' during your childhood, where everyone was obsessed with this movie. It was in theatres for almost a year, and every girl between 8-20 was obsessed with Leonardo DiCaprio. Titanic was everywhere in the late 1990s, and because of its popularity and reputation as a gushy romance movie popular with teenage girls, it attracted a lot of hate. Despite winning numerous Oscars, Titanic, for the longest time, had a negative reputation, especially among men.In hindsight, if you had your image of Titanic shaped by the negative media landscape surrounding it in the late 90s to the 2000s, I highly suggest you give it another go. It really is a wonderful film, and it's enjoyable and fun even if you're a guy. The special effects are second to none, the acting is great and James Horner's soundtrack is absolutely majestic. Even the love story itself, while a bit gushy in parts, is actually quite sweet and endearing. Both Rose and Jack are full realized, strong characters who you care about.My advice, especially to 20-30 something year old men who were told all their life that 'Titanic sucks', is to give it a chance. You're sleeping on not only a great drama, but a great action movie as well.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
One hell of a movie,"I've never watched Titanic until now. It caught my interest when I heard the story about those 5 people who lost their lives on an expedition to the Titanic.I've heard about this movie for years and finally decided to watch it. It's honestly one of the best movies I've seen. I had so many emotions watching it. Laughter, tears, anger, terror etc.The characters were phenomenal. To think of all of those people who really went through pure terror. I couldn't imagine.Needless to say, if you have not seen this movie, please go watch it. I had to add it to my list of favorite movies.Job well done to everyone involved in making this masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Amazing in 1997, 2005, 2015, 2030, 3010 & forever more a Masterpiece!","You can watch this movie in 1997, you can watch it again in 2004 or 2009 or you can watch it in 2015 or 2020, and this movie will get you EVERY TIME. Titanic has made itself FOREVER a timeless classic! I just saw it today (2015) and I was crying my eyeballs out JUST like the first time I saw it back in 1998. This is a movie that is SO touching, SO precise in the making of the boat, the acting and the storyline is BRILLIANT! And the preciseness of the ship makes it even more outstanding!Kate Winslet and Leonardo Dicaprio definitely created a timeless classic that can be watched time and time again and will never get old. This movie will always continue to be a beautiful, painful & tragic movie. 10/10 stars for this masterpiece!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
How many times I watch this movie.... It's still the masterpiece.,"I have watched Titanic how many times I don't know. Everytime I watch it, I still cry, laugh, smile, and feel. The story flows with tension throughout the movie; two actors' acting and chemistry need applaud; Sinking ship is realistically filmed; 'My Heart Will Go On' is perfect fit for Jack and Roses' love story and is timeless as well. All the movie's factors are fully qualified. What more can I say? It is the masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"When the boat sinks, this film starts to rise","Since I was a teenager in 1997, I can say with some degree of confidence that Titanic was made for teenage girls. Almost all of my female friends of the time adored this movie and paid to see it multiple times in theaters, so I can see why it saw so much box office success. Also, there's no question that when the boat sinks, it's terrifyingly spectacular. However, the real downfall of this movie is the terribly corny dialogue. The script sounds like it was written by adolescents. Plus, the love story is overly melodramatic. I can see why Titanic made a splash, but I only really enjoy the last half.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
STANDING OVATION! - (10 stars out of 10),"The stage curtains open ...Not since the advent of the 1995 film, ""Braveheart"", have I ever been as enthralled or emotionally invested into a movie as I was with ""Titanic"". I knew going in, just from the trailer and word-of-mouth, it was going to be good, but I had no idea the ride I was in for when the lights dimmed in the theater that night. I have never understood (and still don't understand) the negative backlash that I've read/heard when it come to this epic film. Because, it is just that - epic in every way, shape or form.We follow along as a young wayfarer named Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) wins a ticket to board the Titanic in a game of chance. During its fateful voyage, he meets and falls for an upper-class girl named Rose (Kate Winslet). Under the thumb of her demanding fiance (Billy Zane) and her narrow-minded mother, Rose is introduced to a different side to life by Jack, and he helps her to find her own individuality and independence, alienating her from a life that she already despises. She must now decide if she'll choose to stay where she is, or leave and have a life with Jack - a decision that is further compounded when the mighty ship strikes an iceberg leading to the eye popping conclusion.What makes this film work is the love story. A lot of the negative reviews I've read complain because there is a love story. But, without it, this movie doesn't work. I am not interested in watching a biography about the Titanic, I want a good story - and this movie certainly delivers that. I was completely invested in Jack and Rose, and when the ship began to sink, I was with them both every step of the way.I highly recommend this movie at 10 stars out of 10. The event of the ship sinking alone was awe inspiring. You are right there in the scene. I could not take my eyes off the screen. The direction is tight, the special effects phenomenal, and the acting completely believable. DiCaprio and Winslet had perfect chemistry. I was affected and moved by ""Titanic"". And even knowing the outcome, I will happily get on board again and again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"No ""Night To Remember""","Watching 'Titanic' was like having 2 people wrestle with a remote channel changer. Just when the movie becomes (historically) interesting, the other person grabs the remote and switches it to a pedestrian daytime soap opera. Did Kate have to be on hand at every step that led to the sinking? (her and Leo are on the side of the deck where the ice hits, of course, JUST missing them; OH! let's put her next to the Captain when he learns Titanic's fate and lack of life boats). The tragedy was story enough and James Cameron did a brilliant business decision to shove a pre-teen love opera to the foreground so girls could flock to the theater over and over to see Leo alive again and again and again...! Give the channel changer back so we can please continue with the story of the ship. Yes, I heard some crying when Leo sank into the abyss...But no sniveling when the little boy (who Leo tries to rescue before the boy is grabbed away from his panicky father) is swept away by the flooded corridor. So much for crying priorities!!I'm a big Cameron fan! Titanic has left him permanently wealthy. And he's tapped into a genre the same way Lucas tapped with Star Wars in attracting a select category of people that were willing to see this over and over (Titanic's billion dollar revenue was the result of many repeat viewings worldwide combining history with poster boy imagery).Special effects were brilliant! But I'll take the 1958 black and white ""A Night To Remember"" movie instead.Today's lesson: If you're going to use an ax to free someone shackled with chains, don't aim, close your eyes tight, THEN swing hard so you won't see the spraying blood. This is life and death...better leave it to luck!7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"Flawed, but with a touch of the sublime.","An extraordinary interest still exists in Cameron's film, still argument rages over just how good it is. The timing of its release was significant, the obsession with the film might be explained as a form of pre millennial tension at the close of the most murderous century the human race has known, a century which began with such hope and optimism, and in which the Titanic was ironically such a proud symbol.'A Night to remember' was released amid worries about the Bomb and the feeling that science was again out of control. 'Titanic' amid millennial jitters. The most discussed aspect is the script, there are lines in the film that are moronic, irritating, senseless and just plain dumb. Others were quoted from the U.S.Senate Enquiry, which proves how people then had a better command of language than we do. Why do Jack and Rose board at Southampton when they've come from Paris? Why doesn't the diamond fall out of Rose's pocket going down with a sinking ship? Why doesn't she find it in her pocket on the Carpathia before reaching New York? Why is it that you can be rude to the ship's owner, assault and abuse the staff, 'fly' from an offlimits bow, run through boiler rooms and cargo holds, cause two stewards looking for you to drown, distract the lookouts, climb in and out of lifeboats, damage property, and NEVER get into trouble? Why do the steerage accept rich snooty first class gatecrashing their party? Why, why, why?Too much time is spent on the wrapping footage, though the unseen sunken interiors are breathtaking. The taste of showing the Titanic sinking like a computer game in front of a survivor isn't questioned. The dissolve of the wreck into the pristine ship packs an emotional wallop every time. Winslet isn't a great actress, she plays the same in every film. On Leo, when Titanic leaves port in a classic series of images, we feel his joy. But it's downhill from here.The engine room montage is another classic, but it's looking artificial. Murdoch's feet are all over the deck. The ship looks like it's populated by the Thunderbirds.Relief, Victor Garber arrives as Thomas Andrews and gives the dialogue meaning, conviction, dignity and charm, quite a feat since thanks to Cameron's warped priorities he only speaks two lines. A thing apparent in Rose is how lacking in charm she is, lighting up at table, and indelicate. No Edwardian. And as this film isn't subtle, but whacks you on the head and biffs you in the stomach we must have the class speech straight away. Tommy Ryan is the most irritating character I've seen on screen and completely unlike any Irish I've met. The next situation isn't credible. Isn't there a better way of introducing these two than the unbelievable jumping off the stern. There is one good line in the dull walk and talk that a first class wench would have said 'This is MY part of the ship' huffs Rose. But with the spit scene any hopes of a romantic wallow are dead.The cheek of the dinner party is how Jack Dawson, somebody who if Rose had chopped his hand off with the axe, would have been pushed to earn a living, has the temerity to lecture a brilliant engineer, a captain with 40 years experience and captains of industry on how to live life, when he hasn't started shaving himself. We need a unmaterialistic message in films, even if it would come better from a director who hadn't overspent his budget by $100million. But the portrayal of rich and poor is straight out of a propaganda film for the gulag.It's a pity, there is such a brilliant Irish band on board, and there aren't equally brilliant dancers.Whether the film has a Christian message at the core or if it's proclaiming that doing your own thing is more important, it's hard to say. The divine service was open to all classes so Jack being turned away is misleading and pointless. A stunning scene on the bow but there hasn't been a romantic exchange yet between this couple that convinces us. Such models of taste and discernment and the brightest thing they say about Monet is that his use of colour is extraordinary. The funniest line in film history: 'This is a ship, only so many places she could be'. The next shot: Titanic bowling merrily along. A thousand rooms!The iceberg finally turns up, the collision is breathtaking, the acting top notch and inseparable from the historical event even if Titanic hits the only iceberg in the whole Atlantic. The surreal party with music and lifejackets shows Cameron can write. Sometimes. But Jack manacled up is tedious and the crew wouldn't have done that on a sinking ship. The real story is lost in Rose running around. The lifeboats when we see them are done far better than any other version, and the timeline makes perfect sense.Titanic alone and helpless, a tiny ship with a futile rocket in an empty ocean is inspired. The film takes on a different dimension and has a touch of the sublime. The images that accompany the hymn are elegiac and perfect. The choreography around the last two boats can't be surpassed. Now we do feel a sense of the panic and despair. The water through the dome, a baptism of fire. No one can fail to be moved by the 20 minutes of terrible destruction. The lifeboat scenes couldn't have been done better, and the Carpathia is a painting brought to life. How exactly Rose retains her incognito through the years when she's a publicized actress, an aviator and everything else in the known universe isn't explained. The ending is a straight pinch from 'Somewhere in time' which did a better job of a love story set in 1912.The frustrating thing is how many things ARE done well. There are gems of writing and acting. It looks terrific. But it proves that you can recreate the cutlery, carpets, staterooms, clothes, but it's so much harder to recreate history. It isn't 1912. And half the film isn't Titanic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Despite a lot of plot flaws and conveniences, this really is one of the best films ever made.","Ah, yes, the film that propelled Leonardi DiCapro to super stardom, became the first film to gross $1 billion, and stayed on the top of the box office charts for 12 years (only to be kicked off the top by another James Cameron film, Avatar).It is said 'Titanic' is the film with the most continuity errors of all films. Despite this, though, the film was indeed a masterpiece. The sheer scale of the sets and entire production were simply mind blowing! The sinking of the Titanic was the greatest ship sinking scene EVER and was done with such meticulous detail that one would think they actually really sunk the ship. Off course, that was not the case, though, as it were all (very elaborate) sets, most of which were destroyed during the making of the film.Leonardo made for a very likable hero, quite frankly one a lot of guys can relate to. The young lovers were so different and yet so alike, and their love story was almost endearing. I must admit, the jumping backwards and forwards in time was a bit unnecessary and resulted in an overlong epic. They should only have told the 1912 story. Apart from that, the film was thrilling, exciting and fascinating in every sense of the word!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

This Film Brought Me To Tears,"I am still crying as I am writing this review as of right now. I don't even know where to begin. I can now see why this film was one of the highest grossing movies of all time. The blending of genres was masterfully done through the style of a Historical Romance/Drama, and a Disaster/Action film. The writing was absolutely superb, for a 3 hour movie I found myself completely engaged not even blinking my eye. The costumes, music, performances, characters, cinematography, dialogue was so magical I can't even put words here to describe the beauty of everything put into this movie. The performances just take your breathe away. Jack and Rose's love story is so full of life and heart and what true love should be even if it's a battle or your not the same class and can't be together ounce you find your soulmate that's what love is about. Their characters felt so human and that really is what puts this movie at a whole new level. The camerawork is some of the best I have ever seen in any film. I don't even want to spoil how thrilling, chilling, beautifully well done the Titanic sinking part of the film is because it is something you just have to see for yourself and experience the devastating heartbreaking tragedy that occurred. James Cameron you are and will always be one of the best filmmakers to ever live and this is your ultimate masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Good movie, but worth all those oscars? I don't think so!","Sure, Titanic was a good movie, the first time you see it, but you really should see it a second time and your opinion of the film will definetly change. The first time you see the movie you see the underlying love-story and think: ooh, how romantic. The second time (and I am not the only one to think this) it is just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie thinking, When is this d**n ship going to sink??? And even this is not as impressive when you see it several times. The acting in this film is not bad, but definetly not great either. Was I glad DiCaprio did not win an oscar for that film, I mean who does he think he is, Anthony Hopkins or Denzel Washington? He does 1 half-good movie and won't do a film for less than $20 million. And then everyone is suprised that there are hardly any films with him in it. But enough about, in my eyes, the worst character of the film. Kate Winslet's performance on the other hand was wonderful. I also tink that the director is very talented to put a film of such a magnitude together. There is one lesson to be learned about this movie: there are too many love-stories as it is, filmmakers shouldn't try to add a crummy romance in to every single movie!!! Out of a possible 100% I give this film a mere 71%.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Timeless, moving, and epic","Every once in a while the conversation will turn to ""favorite movies."" I'll mention Titanic, and at least a couple people will snicker. I pay them no mind because I know that five years ago, these same people were moved to tears by that very movie. And they're too embarrassed now to admit it.I just rewatched Titanic for the first time in a long time. Expecting to simply enjoy the story again, I was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years. I cried again.... in all the same places. It brought me back to 1997 when I can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time. A movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie I can recall (yes, even more than Star Wars). And today, many people won't even admit they enjoyed it. Folks, let's get something straight -- you don't look cool when you badmouth this film. You look like an out of touch cynic.No movie is perfect and this one has a few faults. Some of the dialogue falls flat, and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly. However, none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film.Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful. Leo is one of the fine actors of his generation. Wait 'til you see him in Gangs of New York before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy. Kate Winslet was so strong in this film. The movie really was hers, and she held it together beautifully.James Cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable Titanic. The sinking scenes were horrific, just as they were that night. How anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me. I was utterly transfixed.This film is one memorable scene after another. Titanic leaving port in Southampton. Rose and Jack at the bow, ""flying"". ""Iceberg, right ahead!"" The screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean. The screams of the doomed after she went down. And that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears.The music, which has also been a victim of the film's success, was a key ingredient. James Horner's score was simply perfect. And the love theme was beautiful and tragic. Too bad Celine Dion's pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many.I confess, I am a Titanic buff. As such, I relished the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it -- in all its beauty. Perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because I've had such an interest in the ship all my life. However, I doubt many of those I saw crying were Titanic buffs. I applaud Cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy. The film was made with such humanity.Another reviewer said it better than I ever could: Open up your hearts to Titanic, and you will not be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Neither as good nor as bad as you've been told,"If only James Cameron could write dialogue!This is a well-produced fictionalization of the Titanic and her maiden voyage, with all the historical details just right (well, except for some really minor stuff ...).  The romantic story overlaying it all lends poignancy and drew in the crowds, in record numbers.  The performances are, by and large, good-to-excellent, except for Leonardo DiCaprio, who did much better in his earlier movies (up to and including The Quick and the Dead), and Billy Zane, who's never been able to do more than look like a movie star.Cameron is a great director of action, and a good visual story teller.  Too bad he's such a control freak, he ought to allow someone to re-write all his dialogue so that it sounds like humans talking, not T-1000's.I give this a ""five"" only because the ""seven"" it's currently averaged at is too high.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
As perfect a cinematic experience as you're ever likely to get,"""Based on the tragedy that spawned thousands of heartbreaking true stories, comes this fake one."" It's time to decide: was it insensitive and somewhat cheap of James Cameron to throw two made-up passengers who fall in love onto the ship? Or did these two characters offer the audience an anchor to hold onto as we are guided through the dreadful events of April 15th, 1912? Without a doubt, the latter. The fictional story of Jack and Rose never distracts from the tragic true story, it cinematically enhances it. We never ever miss the bigger picture.First of all, just look at this film. The resplendent wonder of the film's set design, both interior and exterior, places you right on board. It looks and feels the part. And when the inevitable disaster strikes, Cameron grabs onto you and drags you through each painful moment in striking detail. The sinking of the Titanic is brought to life with exquisite attention to detail and astonishing visual effects. It makes for the greatest disaster scenes in any movie I've seen.However, a Roland Emmerich or Michael Bay film this is not, as Cameron never allows the spectacle to distract us from the agony of it. Watching the Titanic being destroyed is not fun or, in its broadest sense, exciting - it's intensely distressing. Unlike most disaster films, it never feels like we're watching a crowd of extras on a film set flailing around. The lead up to the iceberg strike engages you so convincingly in the period, such that each person in front of the camera has been imbued with rich character. And when the ship sinks, it genuinely shocks you to see them go. For a good part of the sinking, Jack and Rose's fictional plight is quite sensibly placed to one side, giving us time to reflect on the truth and how it would have felt to be aboard the ship that horrifying night.So aside from its sweeping spectacle and moving depiction of real-life tragedy, what does the story of Jack and Rose bring to the table? In spite of how persuasive the film is, one must remember - it's ultimately a work of fiction, not a documentary. Like any period drama, it is an interpretation of how society worked at the time. Jack and Rose, as well as being beautifully played by DiCaprio and Winslet, are incredibly well crafted. They are a window into a much more subtle form of racism, which is still prevalent today. It's called class, and in the latter half of the movie, it becomes a tool with which to decide who lives and who dies.Titanic has pretty much anything you can ask for. It's a romance; it's a disaster movie; it's an action film; it's got a sense of humour and wit; it's a period drama; it's a tragedy. Summed up, Titanic is about as perfect a cinematic experience as you're ever likely to get.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Bad and Good - no other film like it,"I first saw ""Titanic"" in fairly early 1998, I think, here in Australia. I went with a girl I had recently got to know on the Internet. She had already seen it, and spoke in raptures about it after we left the cinema, while I was hesitating somewhat, as I was not sure about what I had just witnessed. Since then, I have seen the film at least twice more, including just now, and I stick by my opinion that I have never seen a movie that is so bad and so good at the same time.The bad, as so many people have said, is the script. Well, the characters too. The main romance is so embarrassingly contrived as to be juvenile, and this is not helped by the character of Rose. Quite frankly, I can't stand her, and can only wonder why Jack did not push the little brat off the ship when he had the chance. Speaking of Jack, I liked him. He and Molly Brown were, by far, the two best characters shown. I'm not bagging the acting of Winslett. I think she did well. I just thought her character was loathsome. Not much better is Cal. I couldn't stand him either, and yes, I know you're not meant to like him, but I didn't like the way I didn't like him! Talk about a corny villain. Snobby, cowardly... by the time he picked up the child to get his way off the ship, I was thinking, ""Alright, we get the idea. He's a creep."" Really, I thought the whole ""first class and the rest"" concept was overdone. Yes, I know it was an issue, but it's so clumsy and obvious as to be cringe worthy. But probably the worst and most disappointing character was the captain. Here was someone I would have loved to got to know. Ultimately, the sinking was all his fault. Yet there was no depth to him, instead just coming off as a feeble human being who did and said little, and who looked (understandably) more and more desolate as he saw what was happening.But then there is the good. The sinking. Absolutely incredible. I am always fascinated by the fact that the ship started to sink but, as is the nature of such events, everything looks normal for a while. People moved around as usual, the ship just kept motoring along. And yet we knew it would be under water in a couple of hours. The gradual submersion is enthralling, and technically brilliant. This is why I like to come back to the film, and no it's not because I'm a disaster fan (which I am) who just wants to see people die and not care about things like romance. Not at all. Really, no. A key to such films is depth of character and their relationships with each other. No real people means no emotional charge when said disaster happens. The effects are breathtaking, and the model work stunning. I can't enthuse enough about this part of the film.But the bad comes close to killing it all, and my view does not change after each time I see it. ""Titanic"" polarises me like no other film I've ever seen. It is awful. It is tremendous. Ultimately, the mixture makes it a middling film at best, which is a great shame. How it won Best Picture at the Oscars remains one of the biggest jokes in cinema history. But maybe, if we can forget about the bad, we can revel in the good, and appreciate some of the most stunning moments ever filmed in Hollywood.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Timeless,"Titanic is a true masterpiece and is easily one of the greatest films in history. James Cameron has outdone himself with this epic film that is clearly one for the ages. It is perfect in almost every way and can be watched over and over again. From the directing, beautiful photography and an immortal song by Celine Dion. Not only is a masterful depiction of the sinking of the Titanic but a great love story. Romance is my lowest rated genre so it takes a really well made love story for me to like it and Titanic showcased this. Worthy of all its Oscars and revenue this film has etched itself as one of the great triumphs of cinema. It is loved universally and it is truly timeless.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Every time I see this movie....,"I wake up in the middle of the night with total anxiety.While the fictional story line is fairly cliche and some of the characters are a little cringe (Bill Paxton's hair and earring, for example), the truth is this: 1,517 people died horrible deaths in the icy Atlantic in the dead of night. That eats at me constantly. I think of some of them being all cozy in their beds, happily dreaming of going to America, and suddenly they are waken by the rumbling of the iceberg hit, by the alarms, by the sounds of rising panic and the unbelievably coldness of the weather and water. It saddens me to this day.I caught the movie yet again while channel surfing and sure enough, I stopped and ended up watching the last 90 minutes. The recreation of the sinking is amazing and horrifying. The details presented put you right there. I always put myself in that situation mentally and I wonder what would have become of me. No one can truly know until it actually happens. I think about the cold more than anything. I have been in very cold places before, but never getting soaking wet in that cold. The people who ended up alive in the water went through a horrible hell for a few minutes then hypothermia drifted them off to their deaths. It's haunting to think about. I woke up around 3am after having a dream I was in icy water, trying to catch my breath, trying to stay afloat, and not doing very well at either. The anxiety level increased as I began to wake up and I got mad at myself for watching the movie right before going to bed!My thoughts go out to those souls who perished on the Titanic and I hope beyond hope that there is a better place they went to.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
One of my all-time Favorites,"Titanic is one of my favorite movies, and it is a timeless classic that did not receive the acclaim and respect it deserved. I know that it got Oscar nominations, and it received the hype, but its not even in the top 250 which is very disappointing, because Titanic is as least as good if not better than many of the movies in the top 250. It is unfortunate that it was unpopular among so many people. During its day it was the highest grossing film of all time. Unfortunately the success and hype of the movie have spawned vicious criticism.A lot of viewers love Titanic, but many more bash the film and dissect it for problems such as its ""lack of originality"", ""weak script"", and ""poor acting"", all of which are overly critical and not true. Maybe the script could have been a little better, but it was good enough for me. It may have been simple, but it was still well-written in my opinion. I don't know why everyone say's the acting is bad, I thought all of the cast did very well in this movie. As for the originality, its not the first love story to be told, but in my opinion it is the most believable, epic, and heart-wrenching love story to ever be depicted in a movie. The love the two characters have for each other is totally convincing.Titanic does use a historical setting to set the foundation for the movie, but so do a lot of other great movies. A lot of people say they don't like Titanic because it was too long, but I don't think the movie's length is a problem because it's so good that it's worth the 3 hour commitment. Sure, it could have been a little shorter, but I don't know that it would have been made that much of an improvement. Titanic is indeed a very lengthy film, but the movie is breath-taking because of its strong plot, gorgeous cinematography, phenomenal special effects, and superb acting. A lot of people don't like Leonardo Di Caprio in this movie. In fact, many of the people who didn't like this movie blame Di Caprio. Leonardo Di Caprio is not really respected as an actor but often dismissed as a ""pretty boy"". Leonardo Di Caprio is not the greatest actor ever, but he did a good job in this movie, and I find the attacks on his acting to be unfair. In my opinion he did his best work in this movie.Kate Winslet is perfect in Titanic. She is a very gifted actress who is part of what makes this movie so good. But she didn't do it alone: The chemistry between her character and Leonardo Di Caprio's character is so natural, that it does not seem like they acting at all. Kate Winslet plays a young woman from a rich family named Rose, and Leonardo Di Caprio plays a poor artist named Jack. The two meet on the voyage of the Titanic and fall in love. But Rose is strongly encouraged to marry a rich man named Cal Hockley. Rose's family and Cal disapprove of Jack. Throughout the movie Rose and Jack's relationship develops, much to Cal's dismay. Cal becomes the enemy of both Rose and Jack. He hires a man to capture Jack.A real ocean liner was built for the production of this movie. It is not quite as big as the real Titanic but it is close to it. The replica of the ship looks very authentic, it looks just like the real ship. Titanic may start off a little slow, but it is still very engrossing, in my opinion. The second half of the movie is unforgettable. It is tense, suspenseful, and compelling. Watching this movie makes you feel like you were really on the ship. The movie does include some characters that really were on the ship, but Jack and Rose's characters are fictitious. I'm not sure how accurate the rest of the movie is, but the reality of it all is impeccable. Titanic is a riveting movie that really draws you in to the disaster and the tragedy of that night.I would certainly recommend Titanic, to all audiences. Do not listen the hype though, and do not listen to the criticism either. Just watch the movie, and make your own opinion. If you leave your cynicism at the door, then you may just discover the beauty of this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

bravo,"Firstly and foremostly, I am a guy, which (in most cases) means I did not go see Titanic to see DiCaprio...although I think he can be a great actor.  Reading through earlier comments, i grew a bit weary of hearing about lame script and shallow characters.  I went to see a ship sink...the plot and the characters were, at least to me, a kind of icing on the Cake.  I actually think a lot of the characters were done well; that is, by the time they die in freezing water, you actually felt a tinge of sadness for them.  But , by the time Titanic was over, I was sufficiently moved to make me tell people that it was a great movie.  Kate Winslet was good, Kathy Bates was perfect, Leo was ok (I'll give you people that - I've seen him shine like I know he can ... Basketball Diaries, Romeo & Juliet).  But ultimately, the Titanic sinks...and it was absolutely stunning.  Bravo to Cameron.  He didn't just show us a large ship sinking, he showed us the back half of it crashing down on a hundred freezing, drowning people; he showed us a third class mother attempting to sing her children to sleep because she knew they were all doomed (broke my heart - i cried the most right there at that point), he showed people who worked extremely hard to get OUT of the bowels of the ship only to be sucked back in when a random window shattered and the water carried them on back in...detail.

A romantic movie based on a tragic event,"TitanicIn 1912, The Titanic was transporting 2,240 passengers to the United States. Four days later the ship hit an iceberg, only 706 people survived. Years later, in 1997, Cameron wrote, directed, and co-produced a movie based on these true events. It stars Kate Winslet, Leonardo DiCaprio, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Bill Paxton, Gloria Stuart, and Victor Garber.This movie tells a story about two fictional characters, Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet). They are from too different social classes, Jack doesn't have a lot of money, where Rose's family is rich, along with her mom wanting her to marry into a wealthy family.The combination of practical affects, CGI, and set designs, made everything including the ship sinking look real. The water scenes were filmed in water tanks and made to look like the Atlantic Ocean, this is an impressive accomplishment of the crew.Winslet does a good job portraying someone who is carefree, yet doesn't like her life with her fiancé she's supposed to marry. DiCaprio plays a charming guy who teaches Rose that she can just be herself. Together, they make a convincing couple. Its obvious Jack loves Rose, due to the decisions he makes towards the end. Billy Zane gives a strong performance, as he makes the audience dislike him, because of how he mistreats Rose.

American Women Love the Bad Boy,"It's funny people think this is such a great story - when the spoiled rich girl 'falling for the bad kid' - mad because she's being 'forced to marry the good guy' - is the longest running cliche in Hollywood. LOL

It wasn't as obvious when first released.Seriously, 9 out of 10 'stories for chicks' is this exact same story.Really think about it.From Casablanca to Aladdin - they all have the 'bad boys are more attractive' as the theme.It's no wonder American women are so screwed up.Even the men, for that matter.Who wants to be the guy who doesn't get the girl?

"Haunting, Powerfully Resonant And Visually Stunning","James Cameron's 'Titanic' shares a similar motto to Marmite, ""you either love it or hate it"", I for one love this film, yes I know it's got a drawn out romance story, but there's just something about the 3-hour fill of the film that makes its such a spectacularly emotional and beautiful movie. I saw this a lot when I was growing up, this was one of the films of my childhood, it is truly a powerfully resonant and visually stunning movie of epic proportions. Personally I favour the British original 'A Night to Remember', but this is a pretty close contender. Winner of 11 Oscars, James Cameron's romantic-disaster epic is a triumph of cinema that boasts perfect chemistry between Kate and Leo as the lovers bound for tragedy. Many people disregard this film nowadays solely because it's become the most popular film ever made alongside Cameron's other epic 'Avatar', and whilst 'Titanic' is definitely not one of my favourite films, it's just so powerfully amazing and no doubt at all it has once brought a tear to everyone's eyes. The main aspect I love in this film is James Horner's haunting score that was a key ingredient in the film's success, it is simply perfect, too bad Celine Dion had to close this on her awful pop version. Nonetheless, 'Titanic' is a modern classic and a beautifully spectacular film that will live on.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

My review is this film's 2400th....so what more can I say?!,"""Titanic"" won a bazillion Oscars and is considered a classic by many. And, it now (counting this one) has 2400 reviews. So, what more can I say about this film that hasn't already been said? Well, very little--that is why this review is rather short.I give the film a 9 because it isn't perfect. Some of the characters, to me, seemed a bit simplistic. But, no matter if you like them or not, there's no denying the awesomeness of the film. After all, it looks like you are on a huge cruise ship and the special effects of the wreck (this isn't exactly a spoiler!) are amazing. So, like the story or not, the film is staggering to watch--particularly on a big screen.

"A long, monotonous, piece of epic trash","Titanic is an over-hyped, over-rated piece of garbage. It goes an hour too long and winds on for what seems like decades. The plot is a poorly written, romantic piece of rubbish and the performances by DeCaprio and Winslet are mediocre. However, Billy Zane and Kathy Bates bring some some hope to the non-existent story line. Putting the plot and acting aside, Titanic is a technical milestone. The sequences where the Titanic sinks are nothing short of mind-blowing and you would think you are on the ship.

"Good, but overrated.","I saw the movie for the first time when it arrived on video, needless to say that I had very high expectations for this movie because I heard a lot about it. I watched the movie and I remembered my first reaction when I finished watching it, my reaction was: ""This is it?"" Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad movie, not at all. But I was disappointed about it all and it just didn't met my expectations.Everybody knows the true story about the ship the ""Titanic"" and there are many movies/series made about it already. New about this movie is the love story. It's always dangerous to put a love story in a movie because if the love story doesn't work the movie doesn't work. The love story does work for most parts in this movie, except for some scene's in which I just don't buy it.Although the movie is very long it doesn't really ever get boring, which is of course a good thing. The best part of the movie is the sinking and you can see that James Cameron is really one of the best Action directors in the business.The acting isn't great but not bad either. The special effects look good with the exception of a few needless scene's. The movie is also full of visual mistakes (for instance you can clearly see the camera in a scene, which is a HUGE mistake that I noticed on my first viewing) and the characters in my opinion aren't really interesting enough.Although the movie got more credit then it really deserved I can still recommend this movie to everybody.

The most unbelievable true story someone ever made up.,"When I went to see this film, I was expecting something truly great.  I was sadly very disappointed.  The characters were generally poorly developed, leaving me with a sickly sweet after taste, rather than a feeling of sorrow or compassion. Whilst the talent gathered (Winslet, Zane) hinted at true acting ability (they have provided far better performances in other films), the script is lacking in anything other than schoolgirl Mills and Boon. The technical effects have obviously been done to high standards, as the boat looks impressive, but that is where it ends, as the man-child DiCaprio slaughters the basest of emotional lines, as makes the romance seem cliched and below par. If you absolutely must see this film, see it on the silver screen, as the lack of grandeur which is displayed on the small screen leaves only the ""acting"" to behold.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Amazing,"I saw this movie opening day and it took my breath away. James Cameron's fictional story of Jack and Rose entwined with real life occurances was haunting and absolutely beautiful. He is an amazing director and writer that this movie would not have worked without him.Kate Winslet was stunning as Rose and this movie belonged to her as you couldn't imagine anyone else playing this role.Leonardo DiCaprio was really good as Jack and  he should have had an  an Oscar nomination for this role and the ever brilliant Billy Zane didn't disappoint in his role as Rose's fiance Cal. His portrayl of Cal was so evil that despite being an awful person, you couldn't help but feel sorry for him, especially when despite all his doings he loved Rose so much.James Horner's music was just as haunting and he always lifts the movie he works on to the ultimate level.Kathy Bates was equally impressive in a small role and provided quite a few of the laughs of the film.Everything from the special effects, to the sets to the costumes were pure magic.This would have to be one of the most wonderful films of the 20th Century and one that will never be forgotten.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Obviously this movie wasn't THAT bad or else people wouldn't even BOTHER to talk about it.  I personally enjoyed this film immensly, and still do!  I guess this film isn't for everyone, but it certainly did touch the hearts of many.As for those that think that this film is ""overrated"" or ""over-hyped""...well, we only have the movie-going public to thank for that! lol*  You see, it's not CRITICS/article writers that make a film ""HUGE"" or a ""HIT"" with the general movie-going public.  PEOPLE make the film a huge success.  With Titanic, everyone was in awe.  Let's face it, a film like this had never been made before.  At least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking. This film is so accurate that even James Cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the REAL sinking that fateful day in April 1912. Even the silverware for goodness sakes matched!Give this movie a break you guys!  The critics thought this movie would sink BIG time!  When this movie actually came out and people started hearing by WORD OF MOUTH (which is the BEST form of advertisement mind you) that this was a good/decent/movie worth seeing, then everyone started flocking to the theaters in droves to see this movie...not once, not twice, but maybe 3 times and more!  So, I really wouldn't say that this movie was ""overhyped""...at least not like the buildup for the MATRIX reloaded or the HULK is being ""overhyped"".  ha!  Critics didn't even think that Titanic would make enough money to cover Cameron's gigantic film budget that it took to make this mammoth of a film.  However, the films money took care of that 200 million budget and MUCH more!Personally, I LOVE this film.  However, this film might not be for everyone. DOn't say that this film sucks just because of romance though!  THat is the most sexist thing I've ever heard! Disliking a movie just because it has romance in it!  The story was sweet.  The dialogue could have been better, but let's face it...the REAL star of the movie wasn't Leo or Kate...it was that GIGANTIC Ship!

Triumph in Tradgedy: Titanic,"Titanic directed by James Cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the Titanic.  The plot is simple, noncomplicated, or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense. The end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film, but the love story is an interesting one, however.  Kate Winslett is wonderful as Rose, an aristocratic young lady betrothed by Cal (Billy Zane). Early on the voyage Rose meets Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), a lower class artist on his way to America after winning his ticket aboard Titanic in a poker game.  If he wants something, he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries.  The two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the Titanic primarily through their eyes.The movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures, that sunk with the Titanic, which has recently occurred.  One of the survivors of the Titanic, Rose DeWitt Bukater, who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search.  She gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the Titanic.  With this, the scene shifts to Southhampton, Ireland where the Titanic set sail from on April 10, 1912 as all the passengers are boarding.  After another stop on the Irish coast Titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the Atlantic bound for New York. Historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful, but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as Rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy Cal Hockley and falls in love with third class passenger, Jack Dawson. Captain Smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the White Star Line Director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in New York on Thursday night and not on Friday morning as planned.  Smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty-two years of experience to stretch the Titanic's legs out to full speed.  The Titanic had reports that the waters in the Atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs, but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie.  On April 15, 1912 at 11:39, an iceberg was sighted.  They attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film.  The portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate.  The crew of Titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 2:18 when the lights finally failed.  The lights of the California were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to Titanic's many pleas for help.  The California had tried earlier in the day to warn Titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but Titanic had brushed them off causing the California to turn off its radio and leave the Titanic on its own.  The first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship.  Overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too. The word of White Star Line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking.  Also, the metal that was used to build the Titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold, which were experienced the night Titanic sank to be extremely brittle.  Overall, the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the Titanic.Many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship.  The core group of Rose, Jack, Cal, and Rose's mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time.  Yet many characters such as the Unsinkable Molly Brown; Captain Edward Smith; the ship designer, Thomas Andrew; the White Star Line Representative, Bruce Ismay; and all of the Titanic's officers were real.  The maiden voyage was going to be Captain Edward Smith's last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards.  He had been a part of the White Star Line since 1880 where he worked his way up to his status as the Millionaire's Captain when the Titanic sunk.  The portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol.  He is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that James Cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officer's former Canadian hometown. As shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lower-class passengers from non-English speaking nations.  In addition, Officer Lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted.  The old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the Strauss'.  Not wanting to leave her husband's side Mrs. Strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the Titanic.  Furthermore, Mr. Goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best.  The richest man on the ship, John Jacob Astor, who owned most of Manhattan died nonetheless as well, but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat. In addition, Molly Brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the Carpethia that picked the survivors of Titanic up from the water.  Her ticket on the Titanic had cost over four-thousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke.  All of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware. The gymnasium, which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs.  The wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent re-creation of the Post-Victorian era of 1912.  The rich at this time practically ruled everything, as the women's suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet.  Women during this time often married for financial security as Rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as Cal wished for Rose to do.  The rich did not take well to `new money' such as Molly Brown as depicted.  Everything of the time was very formal.  Women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes. Smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes, which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with Rose in the movie.  Men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes. Women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society. Although James Cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of Titanic coupled with two years spent cross-referencing the history of the Titanic and few liberties were taken.  The beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking.A recognizable message can be seen in the movie Titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise.  The director, James Cameron, shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in people's lives.  Everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the Titanic on that fateful night.  In addition, this film is a reflection of the 1990's when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the Titanic.  Only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual Titanic been found and explored.  This movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed.  However, the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed.  There have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in Titanic but all have failed.  As it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the Titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter.Technically the film is very well done.  To get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie.  In addition, a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean.  Cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside Titanic as anyone has in the 88 years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship.  Furthermore, throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of Titanic to the scene of Titanic during its actual voyage.  This shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner.  At the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the European coast on Titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film.Titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art, a true epic.  Like most history novels, we know the ending, but it doesn't take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture. Certain aspects of this film are Academy Award material including costuming, sound, cintematography, and editing.  If you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early 1900's and how they face disaster, then this movie definitely is for you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

He goes overboard trying to establish Jack as a cool, brave, daredevil bad boy. He's actually a loser with nothing to give a woman. Rose is portrayed as a very proper young lady with an enviable pedigree yet one that should be resented because of privilege. One would think a teenager wrote this screepllay. Even Molly Brown comes across as stale.Again, try to ignore this and focus of the sets and costuming.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"10/10, Perfection","I honestly think that this is the greatest movie that I have ever watched.

Not as bad as I expected - but still none too brilliant,"Well, I'm not going to completely bash this movie. For what it's worth, it's decent entertainment, moves along at a fairly good pace - impressive, considering this is a three hour flick - and Kate and Leo were okay (though both can do much better). I expected worse, knowing it had been horribly over-hyped and that James Cameron was evil (one can argue about how evil). Also, the sets and Kate's dresses were very pretty.That's about it for the positives. The story is shallow and full of holes, most of the dialog is plain silly, and the whole movie is, basically, spectacular kitsch. I honestly think Titanic is probably one of the least deserving Academy Award winners ever - and in the same year as LA Confidential, Good Will Hunting, and even The Full Monty.

Two Movies for the Price of One -- Too Bad Only One of Them Is Decent,"""Titanic"" is really two movies: one of them is an exciting, James Cameron-style action film, ""The Poseidon Adventure"" with better special effects; the other is a dull as dirt period romance, so simplistic and cliché it seems like something conceived in the mind of a twelve-year-old girl.Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet became household names because of their performances in this, and they do invest the film with a great deal of spunk, but they've got absolutely terrible material to work with. Cameron is clearly no writer, but he is a good director of action, so just tune in to this one once the big ship has actually hit the iceberg, and you'll save yourself a lot of time.The supporting cast includes Kathy Bates as Molly Brown, Frances Fisher as Winslet's uptight and aristocratic mother, Victor Garber as the skipper..er...captain, and Billy Zane, in an embarrassingly awful role as the movie's villain. The character as written is like something out of a silent movie, and Zane plays him as such -- if he had a mustache, he'd be twirling it. Too bad his performance is completely at odds with the totally contemporary performances of just about everyone else.Cameron reveals an almost fetishistic obsession with recreating the glamour of the famed ocean liner, and the glee with which he then goes about demolishing it and the people on it borders on the disturbing. It's like watching a little boy build an elaborate train set just so he can have the pleasure of blowing it up with firecrackers.Grade: B",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

There are so many characters involved and each have their moments where they shine, motivations and decisions make sense, nobody turns in a poor performance.The pacing of this film is brilliant considering it's length. The numerous story beats and set pieces all build up towards a final act that's up there with the best cinema has ever offered.It's one of those films that deserves a rewatch every so often; if ever you hear someone dismiss it you must implore them to give it another go.

"A very good film, amazingly underrated on IMDb","It's sometimes difficult to assess a movie that was such a phenomenon in its day. Titanic was a gigantic hit upon release, talked about everywhere, unavoidable. In parallel to its massive popularity, there was also a backlash of people denouncing it as clichéd and overly sentimental, a lot of whom were probably deliberately disliking it because of its ubiquity. Now, it's of that awkward age where it's too recent to merit classic status but too distant to still really be talked about much. As such its standing in posterity seems to be undecided, as yet.Historical romantic epics like this have long been around, and have long done well at box offices and awards ceremonies. And yes, they may be formulaic, but there is a certain craft in ticking all the boxes. Titanic works by bringing us in, with those opening scenes, with the position of a clinical observer of the wreck, as we might have seen it in books or documentaries. The framing narrative has a modern familiarity that we can relate to. We are then gradually eased back into the past, and the story of the ship and those who sailed aboard her become humanized. And I'm not just referring to the central love story. In writing his screenplay, James Cameron goes to lengths to pick hundreds of tiny strands, from the real fates of historical personages to brief flashes of unnamed figures. This broad, human retelling of a great disaster gives Titanic a wonderful richness, not to mention a deeper poignancy.Cameron was at this point best-known for his blockbusting actioners like Aliens and the Terminator movies, so as a director he might have seemed out of his depth on Titanic. But Cameron was always a professional, never a show-off, and he could handle weighty subjects with maturity. He doesn't faff about with the camera, usually keeping it still while all the movement is within the frame. And of course, when the movie turns more action-orientated during the ship's sinking, his experience puts him in good stead. The collision with the iceberg is so suspenseful that, every time I see it, I still hope the ship will turn in time. Throughout the movie, there are a lot of point-of-view shots, more than most filmmakers dare to use these days, but the idea is to bring us close to the sensation of being there. But perhaps Cameron's greatest strength is his finding of an apt image to tell a story in an instant, from a man with his family frantically thumbing through a translation book to find his way off the ship, to Ismay's guilty face against the side of the ship as he is lowered down.The studio took a gamble in allowing Cameron to cast two lead players who were as young and inexperienced as Winslet and DiCaprio, but it paid off. Winslet is not a traditional beauty, but she has a vivacious personality that makes her attractive and instantly likable. At first glance, DiCaprio seems to have been hired for his looks, but he proves to have a deep sincerity, such as when he confronts Winslet and confesses his feelings towards her. And after all, it's moments like this where performance counts the most. But what makes these two work is their believable youthfulness and that eager rapport between them. Passionate love stories that take place over a day or two can easily seem a bit false, but Winslet and DiCaprio seem so great together the briefness of their affair are irrelevant.This diamond of a movie is not, I'll admit, without a few flaws. Despite the brilliant construction of the screenplay, the dialogue is woefully trite. The special effects are typically over-ambitious '90s CGI, with texture-less surfaces and too many fake people (although to be fair it still looks better than, say, a scale-model would). But whereas these problems would stick out like sore thumbs in a lesser picture, Titanic has such a grand sweep and emotional power that they become insignificant. I hope cinematic history will judge Titanic well because regardless of hype and counter-hype, it is everything a movie should be.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"Despite some glaring faults,Cameron's mixing of romance with real life disaster is still impressive and occasionally brilliant","It's really quite odd. When Titanic first came out,the reviews were mixed but the public generally loved it,those who disliked the film were definitely in the minority. Over the years,it has became somewhat fashionable to slag Titanic off,even if a great many of those people who did so were probably amongst those who made it such an enormous hit in the cinemas. Titanic is flawed,definitely,sometimes greatly so. However,it's also a tremendous achievement for it's director James Cameron. Mixing a real disaster with romance is harder to do than some might think. Maybe he did have a right to say ""I'm king of the world"" when the film won Best Picture at the Oscars. Just once.The modern day opening is excellent,making effective use of some of Cameron's real footage he took of the sunken Titanic. There is a real sense of mystery. Than we flash back to the Titanic being boarded,and the film stalls just a little for around two hours. The attention to detail is amazing {even all the cutlery matched,you know} and there is nothing wrong with an extremely slow build up to action-think of The Seven Samourai. However,the central romance between Leo and Kate is often badly written and unconvincing. For a start Kate's Rose would certainly not have done two things she does in the film as quickly as she did {Obviously thousands of teenage girls seeing the film in 1997 would disagree with my views}. We also have to suffer Cameron constantly labouring the point that the poor people on the ship are better than the rich people.However,the final 80 or so minutes,detailing the sinking,is simply brilliant film making. The suspense is built expertly,even though we know what will happen,and climaxes with some technical shots which are still impressive. Perhaps there is a little two much emphasis on the central couple,but there are some truly moving moments,and it really feels true,although of course Cameron did play with the facts a little here and there,as at least one descendant of one of the survivors has pointed out. The following sequence involving the boats is extremely haunting,with some especially good use of sound. As for the final scene,it does manage to be pretty moving,it's schmaltzy but it works {though hardly original,think of Somewhere In Time and various 40s romantic fantasies}.Titanic has some excellent use of CGI {watch out for the transitions from present to the past on the sunken ship} and one glaringly bad special effect-the iceberg which looks like polystyrene. James Horner's best selling score is really quite poor and only occasionally brings the emotion it should do. Performances are generally excellent and sometimes succeed in overcoming some thin characterisation {such as Billy Zane as Rose's fiancée,who even has to suffer with far too much eye make up!}Overall Titanic is still worth seeing,and sometimes it really does hit the heights that it should. It succeeds more than it fails,which is impressive in a film as ambitious as this.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"titanic: visuals rock,script lacks","Titanic is a romantic tear-jerker set in 1912, based on, of course, the ill fated voyage. Leo Dicaprio and Katen Winslet play two young lovers(leo, a little too young looking)aboard the unsinkable ship.The relationship between Leo and Kate felt a little rushed at times, but I suppose they had to skip to the most predictable part of the movie, when the ship sank.James Cameron spent 200mil. making this flick, so yes the visuals of the sinking ship are spectacular. You go back and forth between the suspencefull scenes, seeing leo and kate trying to escape the ship from the inside(cameron at his best). And the eye candy moments of seeing helpless passengers falling off the ship that's suspended in mid air.Sure the end of the movie is sad, but it wouldn't have been at all without the brilliant music by james horner.

"Has its flaws, but in my opinion was pretty good","Yes, it was wildly over-rated, in that respect serving only to inflate Jim cameron's ego.  Yes, it is certainly not the best movie ever made.  Yes, the script was weak, and the acting isn't really too wonderful.  Leonardo DiCaprio has the blandest, most obvious lines I've ever heard, does not act them very well at all, and basically suvrives only on his smile and the fact that everyone knew millions of teenage girls would be swooning.  I didn't understand Billy Zane's character, but he wasn't on very much, so I didn't have to be confused by him a lot.  I do think it's awful that all those girls cried only over ""Leo"" and not over the thousands of people who died, but for those who were watching for another reason, there is still a pretty good movie there, in my opinion.  The scope is amazing, with all the sweeping shots, lavish, mostly accurate details, and spectacular effects. Cameron really orchestartes the mood of every scene wonderfully; though some of it is pretty cheesy, for the most part I really was caught up in it. While the acting isn't spectacular, as I said, some of the people turn in pretty good performances.  Kate Winslet did for the most part, though in the action scenes, where she's given the role of hero, instead of doing something with it she just pants away and screams for Leo and does nothing else.  Otherwise, she handles the acting pretty well.  Frances Fisher, Kathy Bates, the captain, the designer of the ship, and the many third-class passengers were also good.  Even though the movie focused on fictional characters and not on these people, there's enough there to really affect you.  Seeing them being so cruelly and unjustly shut up in steerage and not being allowed to get to the lifeboats is a pretty powerful scene.  And just tell me you weren't in some way moved by the mother singing her kids to sleep, the old couple (who were real) hugging each other in bed, the people getting shot and killed by smokestacks, the captain shutting himself in as the windows break, and the band playing on and on and on.  I mean, come on! This really happened!  It was the most affecting part of the movie for me. I guess it was because I was so affected by it that I felt sad when Leo went under.  All the nay-sayers concentrate on the fiction part, which admittenly isn't up to the standards of these scenes, but also is not the only thing there.  Perhas if people just didn't look at the first part and only at the second part, they'd understand one reason why this movie was so successful. Yes, the teenage girls were a big factor, or so we hear, but plenty of other people went two and three times besides them, and they went because they were so affected by it that they just had to see it again.  Maybe it doesn't deserve to be the most successful movie ever made, but it deserves to be a classic, and undoubtedly will be no matter what anyone says.  Yes, it has flaws, but what movie doesn't?  There's more to this movie besides those flaws, if you just look.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A masterpiece,"For the very first time last night, I watched one of the most universally acclaimed movies of the 1990's, probably of all time, in its entirety with my mom. And that movie is James Cameron's Titanic, a gripping, epic historical drama based on the ill-fated maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic, the magnum opus of the White Star Line, and for her time, the biggest moving object ever built by mankind. Being the most luxurious ocean-liner of the 1910's, she was known as the ""ship of dreams"" to everyone, and ultimately carried over 1,500 people to their deaths in the freezing waters of the North Atlantic very early in the morning of April 15, 1912.Of course, to give the story something of a focus, James Cameron chose to center the movie around two Titanic passengers from very different social classes, who fall in love on the ship's voyage: 17-year-old aristocrat Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) and dirt-poor young artist Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio). And, personally, I think the romantic plotline here really works, and fits in with everything else. It also bears the addition of a villain: Rose's arrogant 30-year-old fiancé, Pittsburgh steel fortune heir Caledon ""Cal"" Hockley (Billy Zane). And he is quite an excellent villain. And if you've read my review for Balto, I know I'm making myself seem like a hypocrite. But here, the idea of a romance/love triangle storyline actually works perfectly in a story about how a ship sunk and people died. Plus, romance aside, James Cameron was very meticulous about staying true to the real sinking, even portraying key events, like the rescue efforts and the band playing. The only other major deviation he made, was the only thing I have to question: portraying the ship's crew as incompetent at best and outright negligent at worst, except for Captain Smith (Bernard Hill), who is actually portrayed as far more benevolent than he truly was. By contrast, First Officer Murdoch (Ewan Stewart), in particular, goes from a heroic officer who died while trying to single-handedly launch a lifeboat (a task requiring 12 men) to taking bribes, shooting two men trying to rush the lifeboats and shooting himself out of remorse, so I'm not surprised his descendants threatened a lawsuit against Cameron. Even WSL CEO J. Bruce Ismay (Jonathan Hyde), who's pretty much the REAL villain of this movie, is depicted as paying no heed to safety, by encouraging a speed record that the WSL already knew the Titanic COULDN'T BREAK! Speeding up against ice warnings was something that the real Captain Smith CHOSE to do, not something the real Ismay suggested. To the movie's credit, the movie does accurately depict Ismay helping people into the lifeboats and only climbing into one himself when nobody is left to call over. And his bad rep came from that alone, so I don't know whether he really deserves it.But anyway, the acting in this movie is fantastic. Kate Winslet, in addition to covering her posh English accent up with a posh American accent, is immensely graceful as Rose. Leonardo DiCaprio is clever and charming as Jack. Billy Zane makes an effective villain as Cal. As for all the Titanic crew members, though their personalities are mostly misrepresented (as mentioned before), they're mostly played by actors who almost accurately resemble their real-life counterparts, and they all do a great job with the material. In regards to the framing device, Gloria Stuart (may she rest in peace) is lovely as elderly Rose. Bill Paxton (may he also rest in peace) is affable as treasure hunter Brock Lovett. And though he isn't really an actor, Lewis Abernathy provides good comic relief as Lewis Bodine, Brock's best friend.The writing is great, too! The movie has an EXCELLENT mixture of excitement, drama, and humor. The sequence of the ship hitting the iceberg and sinking (which occupies at least the halfway point to the 2-hour and 55-minute mark), is exactly as taut and tragic as it needs to be. Some of the more exciting moments include the introductory scene of the ship, and of course, Jack's famous line: ""I'M THE KING OF THE WORLD!!!!!!"" And of course, in a movie about such a tragic event, there has to be levity, hence why the movie brings in some great humor exactly when necessary. A favorite scene of mine is very early on in the movie, during a forensic analysis of the sinking, Bodine drops this fabulous line: ""She's got her whole ass sticking up in the air, and that's a BIG ass!"" HA!Visually, Titanic doesn't disappoint. It's gorgeously filmed, special mention going to the wide shots of the ship out on the sea. In fact, James Cameron actually built a life-size replica of the Titanic for filming, using ORIGINAL BLUEPRINTS!! That's how much he cared about getting it right. The special effects also may be somewhat dated by today's standards, but James Cameron had every right to be proud of the ""Propeller Guy"" bit.And last, but certainly not least, the music! Before, I've expressed my love for the work of James Horner, may he rest in peace, but this movie has, without a doubt, the best score he ever wrote! It's so angelic, so beautiful, so poignant, and sounds exactly right for the mood of every scene, ranging from sounding grand and sweeping during the ship boarding to sounding flawlessly dramatic, suspenseful and ominous during the iceberg collision and the sinking. And of course, in the end credits, his romantic theme for Jack and Rose becomes Celine Dion's world-famous and gorgeous power ballad, ""My Heart Will Go On"", which never fails to give me chills. I'm not kidding when I say that this movie's soundtrack is a must-have!All things considered, Titanic is a masterpiece of epic proportions. The overly long runtime and misrepresentation of the ship's crew definitely forced me to take off a few points, but overall, it has everything you could ever want from a movie: drama, excitement, humor and plenty of other things. Highly recommended!!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

The most beautiful fairy tale,"The legendary film of all time is «Titanic». This film is directed by James Cameron. It's based on the true story of the biggest ship Titanic, who crashed in 1912. It had the most Oscar nominations 11 times. Stars such as Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet starred in the film.It was filmed in Mexica where a full-size model of the ship was made for filming. A pool with a displacement of 4 million liters was also created there. When creating the Titanic, computer graphics and special effects were actively used
This film tells the story of the first and, unfortunately, the last voyage of the largest ship at that time. As well as the love story of two young people who met each other on this ship. The story of a young rich girl, Rosa, who sailed in first class, and a poor artist who won a ticket to a ship in cards.I recommend this film for viewing, because it is very beautifully filmed, beautiful interiors and costumes. A beautiful love story, this is a legendary film that everyone should watch. The whole world knows about him and he personifies all the romantic films of the world. It is about true love, about tears, about friendship, mutual understanding and sacrifice. And of course, the famous Celine Dion soundtrack fits perfectly into the most popular shot from 'Titanic', where two lovers are free and happy on the deck.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Phenomenal movie even if you don't like romance,"I wasn't really looking forward to this film, its a 3 hour romance movie and I am not a big fan of romance, but I gave this a chance and I have to say this is genuinely one of the best films I've ever seen. The movie manages to focus on a relationship between 2 different classes while also keeping it interesting with mystery, an intensity of what might happen, dread for the inevitable ending and also make many other characters interesting in there own right. The romance is done in a very realistic way and because of all the reasons I mentioned, the naturalistic acting of the actors and just how fun most of the characters are to watch on screen the movie really works. They also show the present and while I personally think that's the weakest part of the movie it does supply some interesting plot points and make the film more enjoyable overall as you're not constantly stuck in the past, the ending is also given a much more satisfying conclusion due to the present time scenes. Finally the 3rd act of the movie where the ship comes to its end is done in a brutal way showing just how much ruffles death it caused, how desperate the people where and how sad it was. The movie doesn't pull a punch and due to its long run time you almost feel like you know what it'd be like and almost like you yourself where there. Honestly I massively recommend giving this movie a change 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
One Of Cinema's Greatest Triumphs,"Winner of 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture, the highest-grossing motion picture of its time and a cultural phenomenon that possibly has no equals, Titanic is an extraordinary feat of blockbuster filmmaking that presents its gifted filmmaker at the apex of his craft as he offers a spectacle of such breathtaking cinematic ingenuity & profound emotional depth that it can still rival & demolish most tentpole releases of today on most fronts without breaking a sweat.Written & directed by James Cameron, the story takes a simple premise of two star-crossed lovers from different social classes who fall in love on the maiden voyage of the ill-fated vessel. It is a safe narrative framework to apply amid the backdrop of a tragedy but it is carried out with such warmth, grace & sincerity that we are fully immersed & invested in the unfolding love story and are already on-board when the inevitable happens and turns the sweet, tender romance into a tense, thrilling ride.Despite the story marking a radical departure for Cameron when compared to his earlier efforts, he steers the production ship with sophistication and directs each scene with unfailing authority to deliver the desired goods. James Horner's exquisite & evocative score is as essential to the viewing experience, for it elevates & enriches the journey by an enormous magnitude. And it doesn't end there, for the performances are just as brilliant, with Leonardo DiCaprio & Kate Winslet leading from the front with an infectious chemistry that just works.Overall, Titanic is an immaculately crafted & flawlessly executed Hollywood epic that blends old-school melodrama with astounding visuals to deliver a grand, memorable & powerfully affecting experience. Establishing James Cameron as the one artist you never bet against, catapulting its leads into overnight stardom and still retaining every bit of its magic, appeal & emotional impact after all these years, Titanic is one of the greatest achievements of its medium and is a romantic saga for the ages that engulfed & enraptured a whole generation unlike anything before or since.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A Timeless Masterpiece of Tragic Romance.,"""Titanic"" is not just a movie; it's an experience that takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions.

Over-rated and over-blown but worth seeing,"When Michael Bay made Pearl Harbor, he must have been watching this film over and over again. He repeated many of its strengths and all of its weaknesses.Both films are modern retakes on unforgettable historical events. Both feature spectacular special effects and appealing, talented actors. And both films are rendered mediocre by the same weaknesses: a hackneyed, cliche-ridden romance plot and the weak, clunky dialogue that accompanies it. Add in a few two-dimensional stock characters to back up our young lovers and you've got the modern Hollywood version of the historical epic. Kurosawa and Lean must be spinning in their graves.Nonetheless, I have to give Cameron some credit. He may not have made a really great film since The Terminator or maybe Aliens, but he's never made a boring one to my knowledge. Titanic entertains in spite of its weaknesses--it moves along at a good clip and is well-photographed. Cameron certainly captures the look of the era.The bulk of the credit for this film's success, however, must got to the two charismatic leads. DiCaprio and especially Winslet do an admirable job with the limited material they're given. The scene that worked best for me was when Rose has to rescue Jack, who's been left handcuffed in a room that's rapidly sinking below the waterline. After trying (unsuccessfully) to get men to help her--the expected course of action for a young woman of her time--Rose grabs and axe and sets out to rescue her lover, swallowing back tears and her uncertainty. We see her, in that moment, taking the first steps towards becoming the bold, confident older woman charmingly portrayed by Gloria Stuart in the modern-day sequences.Cameron's very good at showing female characters finding previously untapped depths of character and strength, and he successfully goes back to that well in Titanic. If only he'd punched up the dialogue and done justice to some of the secondary characters, Titanic could have been a great film. As it is, it's just okay. 7/10--barely.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Like greeting an old friend,"No matter how many times I watch this it's like being with an old friend. Even if it's on Television I can tune in at any point and enjoy the ride.The acting, casting and costumes are implacable. Every inch of set design has been thought out (we will excuse the shots of the upper deck on the bow during the sunset shots).The film doesn't age and I would despise a remake. All aspects that Cameron has put in place just work. The sumptuous legendary Titanic with all its complex characters and intertwining stories of class struggle and inequality whilst precariously depicting real people in a real tragic episode. The soundtrack alone is hauntingly beautiful and conjures up images from the film in one's head wherever they may be.Titanic will forever linger in the mind and as every April comes around the films tragedy is paralleled by the reality of the sinking. A beautiful piece of celluloid that has enriched my life and makes me weep each and everytime I see it (at least 4 times a year).",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Tragic tale, triumphant film","Titanic is now a film which people go out of their way to dismiss. Being contemptuous towards the film is the fashionable thing to do. Admitting you like the film marks you as being desperately uncool. Yes, the Titanic-mania of 1997-98 was a bit much. The box office records, the 11 Oscars...at some point people said enough was enough. But this is a film not so easily dismissed. Perhaps it was not worthy of the unprecedented frenzy which surrounded it. But it certainly does not deserve the derision it has received. It is a very solid film. A compelling story, beautiful visuals, stellar performances...this film has much to recommend it. James Cameron risked a lot to bring his vision of Titanic to the screen. The risks paid off. Titanic is great entertainment, truly captivating, at times legitimately thrilling. It's not a perfect movie, maybe it falls a touch short of true greatness but only by the thinnest of margins. All the hype, and all the eventual backlash, can't obscure the fact that this is indeed a very good movie.Of course this film is ultimately destined to turn tragic. But the film is not so much about the sinking of a ship. It is a love story. A very unique, heartwarming love story. A story about a young woman who found the love of her life. And found herself. All in the span of a few days aboard the ill-fated Titanic. Part of the film's charm is that this woman, Rose, tells us her story herself. 101 years old when we meet her Rose takes us back to the Titanic. And with her words she brings the great ship, and its passengers, back to life. One of those passengers is Cal, an arrogant man to whom, much to her chagrin, Rose is engaged. Her family needs Cal's money. Rose does not love him but family, and society, dictate she must marry this rather reprehensible man. But then things take a turn. Rose, in unusual and potentially embarrassing circumstances, meets Jack Dawson. While Rose enjoys first-class splendor Jack is a man from another world. A third-class passenger, no money to his name, no standing in society. Jack has no place in Rose's world. But, rather inevitably, Rose decides she wants a place in Jack's world. Yes, it is one of those scarcely believable stories in which a woman falls madly in love with a man she just met. But in her heart Rose knows. Jack is the one. She must follow her heart. She will throw away her privileged life to be with the man she loves. Unfortunately Cal is not going to give her up easily. But before this conflict can play itself out an iceberg intervenes.The love story of Rose and Jack is easy to embrace, especially when you contrast Jack, so good-hearted, with the vile Cal. Leonardo DiCaprio performs the role of Jack very well, making you believe there is so much more to this guy than is readily apparent. Jack is no ordinary third-class nobody and DiCaprio captures this unique individual wonderfully. But for as good as DiCaprio is it is Kate Winslet who is the real star here. Rose goes on an incredible journey of personal growth and Winslet nails it every step of the way. Rose is radiant, smart, witty and ultimately heroic. Winslet brings all those characteristics to the screen perfectly. Rose finds she is stronger, in so many ways, than she ever imagined. It takes a great actress to evolve along with such a character. And Winslet is clearly a great actress. For as good as DiCaprio and Winslet are in the two key roles the performance of Billy Zane as Cal, the main antagonist, leaves much to be desired. Zane takes Cal's villainy to cartoonish levels, by the end it's impossible to take the character seriously. Spitting his lines rather than speaking them Zane seems absolutely desperate for attention. Unfortunately the attention he brings upon himself is that of sticking out like a sore thumb in an otherwise stellar cast. Cal had to be evil to make the film's story work. But Zane overplays it so badly you half expect to find out that it was Cal who steered the ship into the iceberg and that he did it on purpose.Zane aside the rest of the supporting cast is excellent. While the lead characters are fictional there are many true-life figures aboard the ship. Some, such as ship builder Thomas Andrews, come across very well. Others, such as White Star Line managing director J. Bruce Ismay, do not. Whether those they portray are ultimately heroic, or quite the opposite, the cast by and large do an excellent job bringing these historical figures to life. And Cameron, with a great visual sense, beautiful sets, and state of the art effects, brings the ship to life. Titanic sails again. For the film to really work you had to believe you were really aboard a ship steaming across the Atlantic. Cameron makes it happen. We're right on board, right there with the passengers as they embrace the ship's majesty. And right there with them as the ship sinks to the bottom of the ocean. It is the love story which is at the heart of the film's success. But the sinking of the ship is spectacular, both haunting and thrilling. Perhaps the most fun sequence in the film comes when Rose wanders down to third-class where a raucous party is in full swing. We know that nearly all of those passengers are doomed. But Rose ensures they will not be forgotten. In telling us her story she tells us theirs as well. Through her Cameron has given a voice to all who were lost on that tragic night. Titanic is a film not without its flaws. But it is a film journey well worth taking. Three hours fly by as we follow the first, and last, journey of the great ship.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Mindless tripe, garbage","This film is an insult to the intelligence of the common garden slug. The romance between DiCaprio and Winslet is completely unbelievable, with no real chemistry between the two. The script is complete garbage, crafted solely in the believe that the public is as idiotic as the creator of this film. Though the sinking of the ship is well crafted and visually stunning, there is no pity to be felt for the cardboard characters that inhabit this film. The 3 hours or so spent watching this horrible film could be more constructively used watching paint dry. The plot is slipshod and centered not on the tremendous agony and suffering of those soul's lost on the Titanic, but on the self-centered interests of a girl leaving behind her obligation to her family for a 3-day fling with an artist, which is consumated in the back of a car. My hope is that this film is somehow exposed to the people as the massive dung heap that it is. I suggest people who liked this inane, insulting piece of garbage view a film of real emotional power that was also crafted from historical events from the 1910's, ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT.

A division of morality,"I see little point in being the two thousandth six hundred and nineteenth person in reviewing this movie but why not?

Over all I presumed this movie had little to no impact on my life until I realized it inspired my artistic talent.That mysterious picture of Rose was set in my mind from a very young age and inspires me to this day along with the other pictures in Jacks portfolio. Anyone with an artistic flare would know what I am talking about.Later on in life I presumed this movie was a propaganda piece and took less care to even notice it. Until I took notice.
It became evident that this movie portrayed two peoples exceptionally well, the rich and the poor.
That was the division and a sad one at that.
Its easy to focus on the love life of Jack and Rose but easier to focus on the indignation of the rich and poor and I think the movie might of underplayed that.

Ultra-Hollywood Spin on one of the 20th Century's Most Famous Disasters,"Being of a rather sensitive nature, I steered clear of ""Titanic"", mostly because I did not want to witness the deaths of the 1500+ people who perished in the icy Atlantic waters in 1912. Thus I only recently saw the film on video, months after all the hype, the awards, and subsequent hoopla had played itself out. ""Titanic"" is certainly a lush, beautifully photographed and well-mounted film, although it is almost a bit too ""slick"" for my tastes. I thought Leo and Kate were blandly likable, but I was not very much interested in their characters or their performances. The supporting cast, however, was top-notch, in particular Frances Fisher's remarkably restrained performance as Rose's mother. Ms. Fisher did more acting with a 3-second, tight-lipped glance of disapproval then Leo did with 3 hours worth of stilted dialogue. And Billy Zane managed to twist his classically handsome features into an oily, and sometimes frightening, visage of callow shallowness. The wonderful Kathy Bates always lends a touch of class to whatever role she undertakes, and as Molly Brown she doesn't disappoint. I would have been much more interested in the plot if the story had been told from Molly's perspective rather than Rose's. But the real point of the film is the tragedy itself, which is depicted with harrowing, overwhelming clarity during the sinking sequence. On this level, I think the film is fully realized; however, the fictitious story line is seriously flawed, and I have a difficult time believing Leo as a romantic leading man. In ""Titanic"" he's more like the arrogant kid who should be taken to the woodshed and spanked.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Titanic,"Set around the ill-fated maiden voyage of the RMS ""Titanic"", this is essentially a film in two parts. The first, weaker, element features a young ""Dawson"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who wins a third class ticket to New York on the soon to depart liner. Meantime, the wealthy but unhappy ""Rose"" (Kate Winslet) is up in the posh cabins with her cold and unfeeling fiancée ""Hockley"" (Billy Zane) and her equally unpleasant, venally ambitious mother ""Ruth"" (Frances Fisher). Desperately unhappy, ""Rose"" considers jumping off the prow of the boat, but luckily the charming young ""Dawson"" is on hand to talk her down, and so begins their friendship that causes much chagrin amongst her socially elite companions. That friendship culminates in him making a rather provocative drawing of her, the final straw for her boyfriend and his enforcer ""Lovejoy"" (David Warner). It all looks ominous for both until - part two begins. The ship, speeding along nicely under the command of Bernard Hill's Captain Smith clips the underwater part of an iceberg and now history takes over. James Cameron offers us a purely speculative account of what might have happened as the initially incredulous crew start to realise that maybe it is not just Molly Brown (an excellent Kathy Bates) that's unsinkable! What now ensues are a series of well staged scenarios depicting panic, fear, a fair degree of selfishness and some proper stiff upper lips as the ship has be evacuated and the segregation of the passengers and competencies of the crew start to become life threatening. The visual effects have dated, the smoke from the ship's funnels blows in an strangely symmetrical fashion and the later scenes struggle to convince - but this is really a rather tragic love story with a strong chemistry between the engaging two characters at the top of the bill, and an effective performance from the older ""Rose"" (Gloria Stewart) who takes on the role of narrator 80 years after the disaster. I still find it uncomfortable to watch the actuality of the wreck, which features occasionally throughout the film - I feel like I am quite literally walking through someone's grave; but it does lend a potent hook upon which this lengthy, but well thought out and constructed drama is presented. Criticisms have been made of it's factual inaccuracies, and it may well play a bit fast and loose with some of the real characterisations - but it's a drama, and to be enjoyed has to be appreciated in that sphere.

However, the fictional story of the kindling, but doomed romance of a very unlikely couple is totally unbelievable. Decaprio delivers an adequate performance, but he is unfortunately miscast. Never once did I believe, the sophisticated and mature beauty played by Winslet would ever be romantically interested in someone who looked like a common and mischievous high school boy. This budding romance never rang true; thus, I found it exceedingly difficult to become emotionally involved when their inevitable demise was at hand.

There are so many holes in the film's plot, the villian is similar to one in a Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoon (I was wondering why they didn't give him a mustache which he could rub between his fingers), the long sweeping shots of the ship look horrible, the script is lame and filled with cliched action movie lines and all of the scenes taking place in the present day are worthless and have no place.First, if Rose is telling this story from her perspective how is it that she knows what her fiance is always planning?  How does she know what the crew of the ship is talking about before and after the iceberg hit?  How is it that she knows how exactly Jack got on the ship or what he talked about with his friends onboard?  You get the idea?  Now many movies have this problem, but not a best picture winner. Second, the villian who's name escapes me.  He was so cliched.  So evil it was funny.  He's like Travolta in his new horrible film.Third, the fly over shots of the ship look like garbage.  They are so obviously fake, all the people appear as black, lifeless silohoettes walking the ship. Fourth, the script.  How did these horrible lines that Jack utters get in there?  When danger is afoot, no matter how great all he can utter is his best Keanu Reeves impersonation. Fifth, what is the purpose of showing us the salvage crew?

First half is slushy and unconvincing love story. Second half is an extraordinary and powerful sinking sequence.,"Titanic is a staggeringly expensive and elegant love story, set against one of the most shocking maritime tragedies in history. Prior to its release, the media had their knives out for director James Cameron and were poised like vultures to cut him down to size. The budget had spiralled out-of-control, the film was scheduled with a running time of 3 hours, and everyone predicted a critical and financial disaster of unprecedented magnitude. As it turns out, Titanic is actually a good film. Not an excellent film, which many people seem to suggest, but definitely a good film. The second half in particular, which deals with the sinking of the ship and the chaos and panic that sweeps through the passengers, is very well made cinema.In the present, treasure hunters discover aboard the wreckage of the Titanic a drawing of a naked woman wearing a priceless diamond necklace. An old lady named Rose (Gloria Grahame) sees the drawing on the TV news. She calls in immediately, claiming that she is the woman in the picture. Rose is flown out to the dive centre in the Atlantic, where she narrates the story of how she came to be the subject of the drawing. She tells how a penniless American youth, Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), won a ticket onto the Titanic during a card game in Southampton. She tells how she as a young woman (Kate Winslet) was travelling in first-class with her fiancée, banker Cal Hockley (Billy Zane), and how the two of them were unhappy in their relationship. Gradually, Jack - an aspiring artist - and Rose came together and began to fall in love. Then, the unthinkable happened and the Titanic hit an iceberg....For 90 minutes or so, Titanic almost lives down to the disastrous reputation that had been predicted of it before its release. It is a naive, slushy romantic story in which the love affair that develops is unconvincing and unbelievable. The characters of Rose, Jack and Cal are lifted straight from the pages of a Barbara Cartland-style, clichéd love-and-passion romance. But the film dramatically improves once the iceberg strikes. Cameron is into more comfortable territory at this point, showing his dazzling technical talents and his mastery of spectacle and excitement in a prolonged sinking sequence of true quality. The film suddenly becomes more purposeful and urgent, more exciting and moving. For upwards of an hour, we witness an authentic and harrowing event from a perspective of remarkable realism.Titanic eventually emerged as a phenomenally successful film, and recouped all its budgetary outlay plus a whole lot more. It also made the critics eat the words of their negative predictions. Yes, the opening stretch isn't up to much..... but the ship-sinking sequence more than compensates, and transforms this into a very commendable film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A must see,"I find this movie to be a bit of a childhood favourite of mine when it first was brought to me by my mother to watch this movie. I watched it on repeat throughout the entire day, and that is seriously considering that it is a three hour long movie.I felt a very strong connection between the two main characters being Jack and Rose, and having a strong opinion about the time period and what they were both challenged with in their lives and the way that they found oneAnother is truly beautiful.There are a lot of intense scenes that if you are an emotional person that really connects with the characters and the storyline, and also with the knowledge that it is based on true events, there may be a few confronting seems that will definitely pull out your heart strings.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Was a good movie 20 years ago,"Had good memories of this movie when I watched it years ago but was sadly disappointed watching it again. Great costumes, great directing etc, but such a sickening romance in my opinion, too fake, quite comical.

absolutely pitiful,"A poor flick all around. The only redeeming value comes from the actual sinking of the Titanic, which unfortunately doesn't happen in the first ten minutes. We do get to watch a pathetic love story between Jack & Rose. Actually more like a molestation by Rose since Jack appears to be approximately twelve years old. Very creepy. Oh yeah, horribly casted! I forgot. I can't believe I let my wife talk me into seeing this one when it came out. Let this be a lesson to you all. Cameron is definitely a second rate director and a questionable human being to boot.(Just ask Linda Hamilton) To sum it up, run far and fast from this film. It will only disappoint you. I give it 1 out of ten. Awful is about right.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD,"Classic. Timeless. Perfect love story. These words are usually used to rate this James Cameron film, and they are appropriate. I felt like if this was released this year or any other years, this would be the same award-winning classic as it is. The progression of scenes, from the exciting opening to the chaotic last half of the movie, everything was in perfectly done. Its visual effects were ahead of its time as well. Leonardo DiCaprio's and Kate Winslet's portrayal of this lovely couple was the best in the history of on-screen love teams. Neither was greater of the other.

Romance and tragedy conveyed masterfully,"James Cameron's masterpiece, Titanic, is incontrovertibly the greatest anecdotal tale ever to grace the film industry. This movie has to be Cameron's masterpiece that has never been rivalled in its grandeur. This movie has a phenomenon ability to connect the audience on an emotional level, taking them on an emotional rollercoaster as the characters form bonds and face adversity from all flanks of life. This story juxtaposes the idea of love and power in different shades and angles. Leo and Kate have a relationship that is based on human emotions and desires for bonding, while Zane challenges that connection of human connection by flaunting his wealth and attempting to allure Kate with his affluence. This creates tension between the characters, and the story is very effective at controlling the crescendo so that the audience has an opportunity to connect emotionally with the characters that face this adversity. With Zane always prowling about throughout the movie, trying to win over Kate's heart with his money, there seems to always be a sombre feeling looming in the background as the events unfold between the main characters. This ominous sense of dread that is always suspended in the atmosphere seems to tie in well with the fact that the entire Titanic, the biggest commercial ship in the world, is also portend to face an unknown tragedy in the future. The director effectively seems to symbolize that human love between Kate and Leo as the impervious Titanic ship itself, and reveals the vulnerable side of it. This poetic depiction is demonstrated with so much gusto and romance, that one cannot help but fall in love as the inevitable tragedy dismantles that colossal giant known as love present in all human beings.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

I still am not fully attached to the couple dynamic personally and I think that is what is needed to fully love this movie. Even though I will say that Kate Winslet was above and beyond in this movie! I will say Titanic and Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind has gave me so much appreciation for her acting skills. I only knew her from the Titanic when I was a kid and didn't know how much of an amazing actress she was. But I was really impressed with her in this role. Also I don't know if it was just the Bluray disc I watched or maybe it's just always been this way, but there were some CGI that did not hold up at all.

great film wrong cast,"I loved the story but felt that Leo De caprio was miss cast he was too young looking to play the part, and Kate Winslet was too mature looking to fall for him, after all we all knew the ending but there was no real sexual chemistry between the pair no bite, and it showed in the film it was a script that any actor could have done because the history of the tragedy sold the film not who appeared in it I personally would have chose, Colin Firth to play the male lead part, don't get me wrong caprio was brilliant in the Mask, beach but he did not suite the Titanic, the special effects were brilliant and educational for history purposes you can't go wrong, because the scene where he draws her naked made you squirm had he seemed too young to be there",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

I Don't Have Many Doubts that This is the Most Overrated Movie of All Time,"So, I think everyone knows, but in 1997 one of the most successful films of all time was released. And, it's called Titanic, and it was directed by James Cameron. This film won 11 Oscars in 1997 (including the best film) and had a box office success of titanic grandeur, one of the biggest in history, critically acclaimed, adored by the public and revolutionary for its special effects. Well, despite its undeniable legacy, there are reasons that, obviously, Titanic is not as perfect and wonderful as many people think, and that it does not deserve its Oscars or be selected as one of the best films of all time. The Oscar for best picture should definitely have gone to the fantastic L.A. Confidential, and that movie is way better than this silly melodramatic crap.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"Oi, Cameron. No.","The problem director and writer James Cameron faces with a story about the Titanic is that the majority of his audience will know what happens. So to make his audience care, he switches the action and main plot from the ship, to a socially inappropriate love story between Jack Dawson and Rose Dewitt Bukater. The trouble is that by incorporating the love story theme into the story, he seems to detract from the feel and humanity that previous Titanic films like A Night to Remember have had. Cameron instead opts for two separate halves to the story rather than melding the two separate elements together. The first half concentrating on building an audience rapour with the two main characters, while the second half concentrates on the special effects fuelled sinking of the doomed liner. This would be forgivable if it weren't for several key factors from the first half, the main weakness being the utterly one dimensional lead characters we are presented with. From Caledon Hockleys loveless millionaire to Rose's trapped innocence to Jack Dawson's poor boy with a dream. Aswell played as these characters are, the performance can't make up for the poorly written characters the actors have been given. Again, with the spectacle of the story of the titanic and the millions of dollars at Cameron's disposal, one could forgive the weakness of the characters, but then the  first half of the story is so entirely cliché ridden and full of predictability that it becomes obvious. It is clear that she will leave her safe life and existence and go with the unpredictability of true love. It is almost as though Cameron knows how to tell this story visually, he's just not sure or not capable of making you care about it. Cameron's writing has always come under scrutiny. The comic book quality of films like True Lies and the Terminator films set the scene for his writing style. The childlike quality of some of the dialogue shouldn't but does stand out. ""Something Picasso"" and Freud, is he a passenger?"" are so dire that they belong in a Farrelly Brothers film, not a $200 million blockbuster. Cameron does seem to be writing from the heart, the trouble is that his heart doesn't seem up to the task. ""It's pay-day boys"" and Dicaprio's now legendary ""I'm the king of the world"" seem not to be spoken by the characters in the film, but by Cameron himself. He is the master film-maker who can resurrect the Titanic and will make a fortune from it.Questions that arise on investigation of the film closely are the gaping plot hole of  Rose's narration and status as the main narrative agent. If the story we see is told from Rose's perspective, how are we granted access to scenes such as the Captain's death and Hockley and Lovejoy hatching the plan to trap Jack? Again, if the story we are being told is not from Rose's perspective and is a general overview of the events, why are we subjected to Rose's story telling voice over? Perhaps this is being overly critical of what is simply meant to be viewed as popcorn entertainment and indeed, the film isn't entirely without its merits. The hour long sinking of the ship is indeed breathtaking and the film does have probably three genuinely special moments. Winslet and Dicaprio's flying scene, the ship breaking in two and Jack's death which is surprisingly touching and moving. The trouble is, especially in a three hour long film, that these few moments don't make up for the other half of the film. In a three hour film, half is ninety minutes, the average length of a Hollywood film, perhaps Cameron should have sacrificed some of the unnecessary moments and concentrated the story into perhaps just over two hours.Cameron's back catalogue of films should prepare us for what we are going to see. The Abyss, True Lies and Terminator 2 : Judgement Day show that as a visionary, he can amaze his audience simply by clicking his fingers. The problem lies with his misplaced attempts to try and bring humanity into his stories. In The Abyss, Cameron wants us to care about the relationship between Mary Elisabeth Mastrantonio and Ed Harris. In True Lies, we are asked to care about Schwarzenegger's flagging relationship with his wife Jamie Lee Curtis. Similarly in Titanic, we are asked to ignore the special effects and care about the characters relationship. If Cameron were to write a out and out blockbuster that did not need characters require the audience to care, he would probably create one of the most amazing films ever to be seen. Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to be what he wants to do.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

25th Anniversary Review,"There are two love stories in this film: the first Romeo and Juliet and the second James Cameron and the ship. Every millisecond is thought through, nothing is compromised and the attention to detail is extraordinary. The holes for each rivet in the hull of the 1/20th model were drilled by hand and actors who actually resembled the 1st Class passengers aboard ate and drank using teacups and cutlery stamped with the White Star Line emblem. The production is a seamless mix of miniatures, practical effects, CGI and actual footage from the wreck site and also genius in terms of saving money if you investigate further. There's nothing wrong with Leonardo DiCaprio's performance but Kate Winslet shines and, combined with the backstory of the search for the necklace, Titanic as a whole is an entertaining and respectful blend of fact and fiction, very well paced and doesn't feel like a 3 hour film. I'm a Titanic buff, so biased - the final few minutes of the ship tearing in two with hundreds of people still clinging to the stern makes me wince every time - but James Cameron's version of the disaster genuinely ticks every box. It's not only the most accurate account of the sinking ever committed to screen, but is still and will probably remain one of the best films ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"""You're gonna need a bigger boat"". (see Jaws infra)","It's almost too easy to bash this film. So I'll just paraphrase what James Cameron himself said on TV one night about the ""pitch"" meeting for the film...""I got an idea for a film about a boat. It's about 3 hours long and nothing much is gonna happen for about 2 1/2 hours. Then everbody dies and there's no chance for a sequel. And by the way..it's gonna cost you about $200 million to make it. Whaddya think, guys?""Truth be told..the first half hour or so (the Bill Pullman stuff with actual footage) ain't bad, but nothing I haven't already seen on the Discovery Channel.I'll still take Cameron's ""The Abyss"" every day and twice on Sunday. The guy directs a pretty neat little action film. It's just that I like my disposable love stories served with a side order of humor..and maybe some actual ""acting"". You know. The stuff that actors do in movies? In ""The Abyss"", Ed Harris and the gang got into their characters enough to give the movie a nice kick. Leo and Co. are reduced to playing second fiddle to blue screen effects.And here's another shining moment for the Oscars.

"Long, boring and totally unmoving","Special effects junkies may get something out of this film, but I found it long, very boring and totally unmoving.  The characters in general were shallow and one-dimensional;  none of the main characters were in the slightest bit likeable, and the film's potential was ruined by the extremely silly and totally fabricated central story of the ""upstairs/downstairs"" romance between Di Caprio and Winslett.  This totally implausible bit of the plot succeeds in turning this tale of a terrible human tragedy into just another trite Hollywoodisation in which only beautiful people and thwarted love count for much.

It's one of those films that remains close to your heart forever.Excellent acting from the whole cast, especially DiCaprio and Winslet. Some scenes which come to mind include the dining room scene, Rose communicates to Jack on a level that the other actors don't even sense, a sentence which is echoed on page 95 of ""James Camerons Titanic"" It is a film that will have you hooked and on the edge of your seats.

"Very ambitious, but beautifully filmed and acted.","I had few problems with this film, and I have heard a lot of criticisms saying it is overlong and overrated. True, it is over three hours long, but I was amazed that it goes by so quickly. I don't think it is overrated at all, I think the IMDb rating is perfectly decent. The film looks sumptuous, with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects, and the direction from James Cameron rarely slips from focus. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Jack, and Kate Winslet is lovely as Rose. David Warner, a great actor, steals every scene he's in. The story is very rich in detail, and is hot on character development, obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be, though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow. The last hour is extremely riveting, and I will confess that I was on the edge of my seat, when the Titanic sank. I will also say that the last five minutes were very moving. The music score by James Horner was lovely, though I never was a huge fan of the song My Heart will Go On. The 1996 miniseries was good, but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies. Overall, I give Titanic an 8.5/10. Bethany Cox.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Technically brilliant, let down by the actors","I resisted all the hype at the time this film came out, and managed to wait until it appeared on TV before seeing it for the first time. It was a profoundly impressive film, but only in certain respects. The plot was thin and predictable (well, I suppose in a film named 'Titanic', the plot pretty well *has* to be predictable), and the acting was fairly mediocre. I guess what I found so impressive was just the overwhelmingly good job that was done on making you feel like you were right there. Everything from the simulated aerial shots of the ship at the beginning of the film, right through to the close ups of events during the disaster itself is done so well that you can immerse yourself (if you'll pardon the joke) in the experience.It is just a pity that the acting from most of the performers didn't rise to the occasion. It is easy to see why none of the film's 11 Oscars was for acting. I suppose I'm a bit biased because I personally cannot stand DiCaprio, who can't act to save his soul, but I found the other performances to be less than the film really needed.Overall, though, the impressive technical achievement in bringing Titanic to the screen outweighs the human shortcomings, giving the film a rating of 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Has all the right elements to be a great romance movie for the mainstream audience,"I saw this movie when it first came out in theater and the whole theater was packed and for good reason. This has many elements to make a good romance movie, yeah it gets a bit sappy and corny but that is passable. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie when it first came out but acted like I hated it for the sake of hating it. Because it came out sometime when I was in elementary school and all the kids back then was making fun of this movie. Although some of them probably enjoyed watching this movie as well. This is the movie that made Leonardo DiCaprio and made him a teenage heartthrob. So the plot is basically this to put it simply, it's about a romance that blossoms on a ship called Titanic between a poor guy named name Jack Dawson(Leonardo DiCario) and Rose(Kate Winslet). But Rose is engaged to a douche but the romance between Jack and Rose increases even during the sinking of the ship. I am not giving anything away since anyone that knows a bit of history knows that the Titanic sank. And when the human nature when it comes to survival kicks in, that is done in a pretty realistic manner. Even if the romance aspect of this movie is pretty straightforward but at least it's engaging and that is what matters. Everything from the cinematography to special effects were phenomenal for a movie from the late 90's and it's still spot on today. I finally got the chance to see this movie in 3D again and it was still good. And the conversion to 3D is done well.7.9/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Powerful Film About Finding The Will To Live,"The true reason that Jack has to die doesn't lie in the physics of surviving in very cold water, but in the inner logic of the story. Jack has to die because he exists in order to empower Rose and give her the will to live. And once that story purpose is fulfilled, he's gone.I think we tend to fixate on the insanely iconic romance scenes and the sinking of the ship. But a big focus of the actual movie is on the theme of finding the will to live. From Roses perspective, it's as if Jack conveniently springs into existence precisely when she needs him to stop her from ending her life and reveal to her a better way out of her misery. The moment that Jack dies is also the moment when Rose finally commits wholeheartedly to not dying. Jack teaches Rose to keep the fire going within her to rekindle in her the desire to live.Before the Titanic hits the iceberg, money, expressed as the classes onboard, seems all-important, especially to the people in first class. But when we're facing down death, all the riches in the world are suddenly revelled to be worthless. The move illustrates this perfectly when Cal tries to bride First officer Murdoch for a seat on the lifeboat. But Murdoch is about to die; so what use is money to him? Therefore if your ship is going down what does it matter what class you're going to die in? Near the end of the movie, we're told Cal commits suicide after losing much of his money in the Crash of 29. So because Cal cant understand that money really isn't everything, it's as if he never actually learns what the value of life is. When the older rose throws the heart of the ocean into the water at the end, she's again rejecting Cal's value system and the idea that wealth matters anywhere near as much as those inner, spiritual things that drive us. So Rose is giving the heart of the ocean back to Jack and recognizing the way that he resorted her heart to her - helping her find the fire within that she needed to live this long, full life.Rose appears at the start to be the ""damsel in distress' type. But it quickly becomes clear that Rose is our real hero - she's the one who undergoes a complete transformation, and this is her story. Jack exists to service Rose's story. Jack purpose in Titanic is to enable Rose's character growth. Jack has given her all the tools necessary for her survival, so his role in the story is complete. And that, essentially is why he has to die at the end. Not because he can't fit on the door but because the story has no more use for him. In the later story, the crew searching for the diamond tell us they didn't find anything on Jack and there's no record of him. The story gives us an excuse for this - Jack won his ticket last minute in a poker game. But it seems intentional that the movie plants the tiniest seed of doubt as to whether Jack was really on the ship after all. At the end of Rose's life. Jacks memory is completely erased from the world, except for the indelible impact he's left on her - so he's alive only in her heart. It's a bit of a stretch to read Titanic as Rose's romance with a guy who's totally imaginary - of course, many others interact with Jack. But the point is that jack has a subtle air of unreality about him... he feels like some fantasy of a sexy life-coach that every girl needs from time to time to help her reorient her heart in the right direction.Jack is the piece of her that's missing. A woman getting in touch with her animus (Masculine Side) often involves finding strength of will and determination to act. These are things that historically, society hasn't really encouraged in women (espeically in 1912). But as soon as Rose merges with Jack, her animus, she becomes daring and holds, her own woman. In an incredibly accelerated timeline, she ditches her fiance and turns her back on her family and social class. Rose shows sexual agency, too, actively pursuing Jack in their romance. And after she has sex with Jack, Rose is assertive, holding and comforting him. When she arrives on the other shore, she assumes a new name in a new country. Taking his last name is a symbolic commitment to Jack, representing the idea that in her secret mind, she is forever married to him. But if we say that he's her animus her ""marriage' to this piece of herself would symbolize a promise that she'll never abandon her own agency and will again. Jacks death can be read as the moment when her animus ceases to be something sperate from her - and the result is Rose Dawson.So as much as our culture remembers Titanic for the romance, fittingly the deepest theme of this movie about so many tragic deaths is finding the will to live.

Loved this movie,"This movie has always been one of my favorites the love story and everything about it like yes I know the storyline of the movie was made up and that there really was no rose and jack but besides that I love every aspect of this movie the way they dressed or the way the acted is just amazing this movie is one of the very few movies I probably will never get tired of. Ive rewatched it so many times I lost track. This movie honestly makes me cry always there hasn't been one time where I didn't cry to this movie, I know so many have already watched this movie but I would still recommend this movie to people.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"A triumph of Hollywood dazzle over an overblown, needlessly trumped up script.","There are a ton of problems in ""Titanic"" – the cartoon villains, the stilted dialog, much of it obviously re-recorded in post production. Some weak supporting performances, the betrayal of a number of historical facts, and taking what was already one of the most dramatic nights of the 20th century and needlessly pumping it up with chases, gunfire, theft, scheming, etc.Yet a lot works. As much as I didn't want to give in, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio make a great, old fashioned, star crossed romantic couple. Many of the effects and stunts are amazing (although at other times you realize some wide shots are basically giant video-game like cartoons). And it made me cry -- while I felt like a fool for being swept up in it's shameless melodrama.I can't argue that ""Titanic"" is art, or deep, or a great film, but I can say it's a terrifically effective entertainment that everyone should see at least once.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A masterpiece that stands the test of time,"It doesn't matter if you first watched it in 1997, 2012 or 2022, in 2D, 3D or with a live orchestra, this film is absolutely iconic!And it is not due to it being a simple cultural phenomenon it is truly because this film delivers quality from start to finish.It is a 3h14 emotional rollercoaster with no dull moment. In fact it makes you want it to be even longer, that's how amazingly made it is.The setting, the pace, the acting, all gripping and immersive. Yes there is some outdated 3D effects that look a bit comical nowadays but it's insignificant compared to the breathtaking practical effects.It is so well made that the tension never fades even after several viewing and despite knowing that the boat will definitely hit the iceberg you still find yourself holding your breath hoping that this time it will not.It is the kind of film that stays with you because you really live it while watching it. It is a lesson of hope also and encourages to tackle life with courage.Don't forget the tissues because you will cry!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Once they hit the iceberg, it's great","Disaster movies might be my favorite genre. There's a simple formula to these movies: the first half hour is the set-up and then the roof caves in. Writer/director/producer James Cameron missed the memo. Cameron takes over an hour and a half to get to the meat and potatoes. It's time wasted. The first half of ""Titanic"" is long and tedious. The bookend story isn't that interesting. The voyage stuff is pure melodrama. The dialogue is corny with way too much ""explaining"". That stuff is informative but it never sounds real. For some reason the strong cast isn't very good either. Overall, they get a grade of C+. It's when ""Titanic"" hits the iceberg that the movie really comes alive. It's exciting and very emotional. The last hour or so is classic. I saw ""Titanic"" twice in the theater. Once when it first came out and the other time was for its 3D re-release. I've also seen it a bunch of times at home (including tonight). I don't watch it as often as I did because I'm starting to really dislike the first half. Dishonorable mention: Kate Winslet's less than thrilling nude scene.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A real life story with a fictional twist,"It all starts off with a 100 year old woman named Rose DeWitt Bukater telling her story full of love and loss. The story takes place on the luxurious, but ill-fated R.M.S. Titanic, with young Rose boarding the departed ship with the upper class passengers and her mother. Meanwhile, a traveler and an artist named Jack Dawson and his best friend Fabrizio win third class tickets to the ship in a game of poker. The story explains a seventeen-year-old noblewomen falling in love with a kind, but poor artist.It is a real life story, with a fictional twist. The movie shows two completely different worlds and how they connect, putting aside the labels and showing the purest of love. A great lesson for the real world. Jack and Rose spend their days together experiencing and learning new things from each other. The tale starts off with young Rose convincing herself to jump off of the ship due to her life situation of being forced to marry a self involved man that only loves money and himself. Jack spots young Rose leaning over the rail and tries to convince her saying ""I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain. Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here."" His attempt to help is successful and is invited to a meal as a result of his heroic act.The whole story with the movie is iconic. It has greatly impacted then and is still now. It has made a major impact in the movie industry, and is still evolving. It's a story being told while also being lived at the same time. Now the ship lies at the bottom of the ocean with its remains only able to last another 15 to 20 years, the film is here to keep the memory of the titanic alive. Great success and great things have come out of this movie for many different reasons.I recommend this movie for anyone from teens/young adults to elders. The historic event tying to a beautiful, but fictional story. It's been over 105 years and people are still fascinated with it. So if you are looking to watch a love story that never fails to make you cry, or maybe also a movie with a historic purpose, then I highly recommend watching the Titanic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Why Titanic Doesn't Hold Water,"Titanic, a film that led us to believe we were about to witness the greatest cinematic masterpiece of all time. Spoiler alert: it wasn't.First, let's address the overexposure and overhype that continue to haunt our nightmares. Remember when My Heart Will Go On played on every radio station and in every mall, and we couldn't escape the tragic love story of Jack and Rose even if we tried? It's as if Titanic was the only ship to ever sink or the only love story ever told. Instead of a respectful historical drama, we got a melodramatic love story that would make daytime soap operas look like high art.Speaking of melodrama, let's not forget the ""iconic"" love story between Jack and Rose. Who could resist a ""forbidden"" romance that's as fresh as a 100-year-old can of beans? Jack is a penniless artist because, of course, all artists are secretly charming rebels who win over rich, uptight girls. Then there's Rose, the rich, uptight girl who's clearly in dire need of saving from her diamond-clad life. It's essentially a love story that makes you wonder if a shipwreck was the only way these two could meet, because where else could a poor guy and a rich girl fall in love other than on a doomed ship? And as the ship sinks, we're treated to an hours-long disaster sequence that makes you wish you were drowning just to escape the melodrama. Jack and Rose's romance is like a never-ending crying contest, complete with cheesy dialogue and longing gazes. Their ""I'm the king of the world!"" moment was about as subtle as a sledgehammer, and their tragic farewell in the icy depths was enough to make anyone scream, ""I'll never let go!"" Ugh.Titanic may have won countless awards, but it's a cinematic iceberg that'll leave you feeling colder than the North Atlantic Ocean. In retrospect, the film and its soundtrack have aged about as gracefully as a rusted anchor. The haunting refrain of My Heart Will Go On is like nails on a chalkboard, but with extra cheese. The once epic and emotional scenes now probably just make you cringe; a cringe goes on and on. It's outdated, cheesy, and so overly dramatic. The film has become a relic of a bygone era that should have stayed buried in the depths of the ocean.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
This was Worst Movie I Ever Saw Until Pearl Harbor Came Out in 2001,"I see people writing about how great this movie was. It was horrible! The acting was sub-par at best. It made a lot of money because teenage girls went to see the movie 7 times in the theaters because of Leonardo. Where the hell did they get the money? Anyway, I wanted to learn more about the Titanic; why it sank, what was running through a lot of people's minds; maybe even a little conspiracy stuff. Does anyone realize that certain people didn't even board the ship because there was a fire on board before it even took off? No, you don't because all you see is a rich girl falling for a poor boy and he paints her naked (did that corny junk at least tip you off that the movie was stupid?).I did cry in during one scene, though. The scene when they showed the water that was filling up in the ship. It looked like pool water! I'm thinking this movie made all this money and they couldn't even make the water from the ocean look real? unbelievable...Ohhh the band played on while the ship sank.. Just ridiculous.

The level of Titanic research and detail done by James Cameron is unmatched. There is nothing about this movie that isn't perfection. It won every award it was nominated in the year it was released.

Incredible Movie Making,"An absolutely spellbinding film that still holds up over 20 years later. I first saw this as a 12-year-old in 1997 and recall being utterly captivated by the story, the imagery, the characters, the score and the sheer spectacle of it all. 'Titanic' was an event, not just a film. There was nothing like it before, and there has been nothing like it since.
Leonardo di Caprio and Kate Winslet, both relatively unknown actors at the time of the film's original release, shine as Jack and Rose, two young people from opposite ends of the social spectrum who are brought together by fate against the backdrop of one of history's greatest tragedies. Winslet steals every scene with her portrayal of a deeply unhappy woman thrust into an engagement of convenience at the behest of her domineering mother, only finding happiness and her true self when she crosses paths with di Caprio's Jack Dawson. Tragedy inevitably strikes however, and it becomes a fight for survival as the great ship Titanic founders. For all of the special effects, it is the chemistry between Winslet and di Caprio that drives the film. If you have ever become infatuated with someone in a very short space of time, then it is very easy to relate to the relationship between Jack and Rose. They perfectly capture the intensity of infatuation and the recklessness of youth. Other excellent characters include Billy Zane's charming but abrasive Cal Hockley, Frances Fisher's sneering Ruth Dewitt Bukater and Kathy Bates' bolshy Molly Brown. Finally, the great Gloria Stewart portrays 'old' Rose with such sincerity and heart that it is difficult to believe she didn't live through all of this in real life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Titanic Review,"Reviewed on May 8, 2011.That's not all the movies I've watched today. After rewinding the Grease VHS and ejecting it out my VCR, I put in Titanic, and that was such a long movie. My parents also got this at Blockbuster back in 1998 as well. This is still an emotional movie. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet's performances as Jack and Rose are outstanding, James Cameron's direction is great, the soundtrack is amazing (especially ""My Heart Will Go On"" by Celine Dion), the special effects are well done, and the famous ""I'm the king of the world!"" line is so unforgettable.Titanic is such a masterpiece. This was my favorite 1997 movie, but recently I watched Princess Mononoke and now that is my favorite 1997 movie.Rating: 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Holds up very, very well","I was pleasantly surprised at how well James Cameron's ""Titanic"" plays after all these years, even standing up convincingly to the challenge of being cablecast on TV with endless commercial interruptions.Of course, the central romance starring Leo and Kate is terrific, extremely well-acted by the future superstars. And the supporting cast is fun, though I felt sorry for Billy Zane (with hair) being made such an ultra-villain, with only a voice-over to punish him via the '29 stock market crash -but Cameron knew best.Especially impressive this time was the clever way Cameron amplified the drama in the lengthy disaster movie section of the film, balancing Zane & David Warner's old school treachery with the priceless diamond against the many locked/escaped adventures of our dynamic couple. And Gloria Stuart's terrific supporting role was balanced for me by the sadness of seeing Bill Paxton one more time, alas taken from us too soon.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Mixed emotions after seeing it years later.,"Titanic' was quite the phenomenon when it came out. There is no movie that I can think of, at least in my lifetime, that became the cultural event that it did. There were many concerns within the film community that the film was going to be a disaster. James Cameron had spent a long time finishing the film and it was the most costly film ever made. Many people thought it was bring an end to his career. All these concerns and predictions were shattered when 'Titanic' came out; it became the highest grossing movie ever and it won more Academy awards than any other movie. It skyrocketed the careers of both Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio. I went to the theaters to see it with family and friends. It was an incredible experience and several people around me were crying. There were very few movies I had ever seen before that had mesmerized me as much as this movie did.I watched this movie in its entirety for the first time in years. The reaction is much different now and the film seems much less impressive. First of all, the graphics in 'Titanic' have not aged well. When the ship is sinking, the CGIs look really fake and dated. Also, the model ship they used doesn't look very good either. It looks cheap and like it was made out of plastic! This does not surprise me because most films do not age well; a new generation of film lovers will not find certain films as impressive as the last generation. Putting that aside, the story of 'Titanic' is not that bad. I think most people know what the story is about so I do not need to explain it. The acting is slightly above average, but the screenplay is so clichéd and corny, I can understand the acting did not need to be that impressive. The last forty minutes of the film consists of the two main characters shouting, ""Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack! Rose, Rose, Rose, Rose!"" They must love each other so much that they can't think of anything else to say.I don't think 'Titanic' is destined to become a classic. Even though it made so much money and won so many awards, I think most people now see the movie as an embarrassment. Now that I am older and wiser, 'Titanic' just seems like a mediocre film. Pretty disappointing considering how much the movie was loved when it first came out.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
History&Memory,"If we have to figure out what the most precious identity humans have, that must be memory. We can absolutely remember lots of things happened during our 80-year lives.

The first time I watched this film was in my early age. And some precious memory of my own happened during that time. Maybe this is the most important part of the movie to myself.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Bravo,"Titanic is a movie I've seen countless times since I was a little kid and it came out. This movie is one that seems to polarize people to extremes. Some love it and will call it one of the best movies they've seen and others will hate it and label it one of the worst. As far as where I stand on it today, I still believe it is a very good film that benefits from marvelous special effects. Jack wins his way onto the Titanic in a poker game and runs into first class rich girl, Rose, when she is hanging off the end of the ship, apparently about to commit suicide. Jack saves her and they start spending a lot of time together, which really pisses off Rose's rich, but unpleasant fiancé, Cal Hockley. The story is told by the 102 year old Rose, as treasure seeker Brock Lovett searches for a diamond that was given to Rose by Cal on the boat. The movie has its share of problems. The dialogue, at times, can be corny, as can the actions. The acting, while serviceable most of the time, has some terrible moments, especially from Billy Zane and Bill Paxton. Also, the film suffers slightly from its long run time. It's not something that bothers me a great deal, but had the film been cut by something like 20 or 30 minutes, it would have flowed a lot better. Titanic isn't James Cameron's best film, but it is a majestic and epic one. I like Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as Jack and Rose, and I also really liked Kathy Bates as a first class passenger that has just come into her money. This isn't one of the best films ever, but it's, at times, fun, sad, infuriating, and joyful. There's an emotional roller-coaster going on here.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Stop it, just stop it, or I'll scream!","Has the world gone utterly mad? ""Titanic"" is the best/greatest/most wonderfullest movie of all time? Nooooooooooo!Come on, people, let's get a few things straight.First the good news: (1) ""Titanic"" had lovely (and seemingly accurate) costuming, (2) beautiful sets, (3) first-rate special effects (okay, let's call the F/X spectacular), and (4) a gorgeous musical score. Overall, I was so touched at the end of the movie that my eyes were filled with tears (for some strange reason my wife finds my sentimentality amusing).Now the bad news: (1) the scripting was awful (some of the dialogue that came out of the characters' mouths made me winch with pain), (2) the characterizations were weak and predictable (there was no doubt as to who were the good guys and who were the bad guys. All the good guys were totally good, all the bad guys were totally bad. If you ever want to see a person who has both good AND evil qualities all you need to do is look in the mirror: it's called human nature), (3) some scenes can only be described as vulgar Disneyesque (who can forget that romantic ""I'll jump your bones you in the back of the car number?"" Oh, and let's not forget the hand running down the window, now that was touching), (4) blame the script all you want, but the acting was weak, and finally, (5) one of the worst scenes in a motion picture: the infamous ""I'll teach you how to spit"" scene. That was in such bad taste. With the possible exception of really uncouth adolescents, who could watch that scene and not be repelled?Okay, now that I've gotten that off my chest I feel so much better.To conclude, no, ""Titanic"" was NOT the best movie of all time, nor was it the worst. It's a must-see movie, no doubt about it. It is a great movie if you like black-and-white characters with a color-by-numbers story line. Unfortunately if you demand complex characters, solid acting, and credible plots you will be sorely disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Great love Story,I am 27 years old this movie came out when I was 3 and I just watched it for the first time and I am kicking myself in the behind for not watching it way before now. This is the BEST movie and GREATEST love story I've ever seen. This movie really got me in my feelings. They could not have chosen anyone better than Leonardo DiCaprio( he is gorgeous) and Kate Winslet to play jack and rose. They played those characters with so much heart and feeling that it almost seemed like real life. You could tell they really gave it their all and I cried like a baby at the end. And the music My heart will go on by Celine Dion was the PERFECT song for this movie. It just really moves you.

Breathtaking recreation of the tragic voyage,"Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are young lovers on the doomed ""Titanic"" in this 1997 film directed, written, and edited by James Cameron. The film also stars Billy Zane, Gloria Stuart, Kathy Bates, Francis Fisher, and Victor Garber.Rather than go into the story, I'll just say that this film is a true masterpiece, meticulously researched, designed, costumed, and acted, and gives one the feeling of the desperation, fear, sorrow, and finality that the people on the ship must have felt. The entire time I watched it, I kept thinking of the people on the planes and in the World Trade Center on 9/11.There have been several films about the Titanic but none so lovingly recreated and so powerful emotionally. Kate Winslet is exquisite as Rose, the upper class young woman engaged to a brute (Zane), who falls in love with third class passenger Jack Dawson (DiCaprio). DiCaprio is terrific - exuberant, passionate, and adventurous.If you don't know a lot about the Titanic, this movie will pique your interest. When you read more about it, you'll be impressed by Cameron's commitment to bring this piece of history to life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

What impressed me the most was the accurate detail involved in both the sets and the telling of the story. It's central story about two lovers destined to be torn apart by events taking place around them, is never boring. More important is the telling of the ship's disaster itself.With breathtaking special effects the movie viewer is brought onto the ship and made to feel a part of the on-going action. Mr. Cameron has given us a closer look than we have ever had, or probably ever will have, at what happened that fateful night of it's sinking. To coin a term from another well made movie on the subject, it is truly, ""Ä Night To Remember.""Thanks to James Cameron caring and skill and excellent performances all around, this is a picture to be proud of, and a tribute to an event that should never be forgotten in the annals of history.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
3D not very good in spots,"Much of the 3D conversion in the earlier part of the film looked phony and actually detracted from the story. The images looked like multiple 2D layers pasted at different distances and each layer looked flat and lacked depth, making for an incongruous and distracting image, unlike a film shot with a twin lens camera to begin with.Later scenes, shot at greater distances where the 3D effect was more subtle, were more effective and sometimes quite stunning.(Note, review policy demands that I have at least ten lines of text.

"Come on, admit it. This is a great film!","When you have a film this big and successful, it just stands to reason that a number of people are going to try to bash it. Especially when it happens to be a romance. And sure enough, I am the only male I know who has anything positive at all to say about it. Is all of the criticism warranted? Let's see...Jim Cameron didn't need to create this huge-scale, heavily detailed historical drama to prove to me he was a great director. This film did pretty much convince the rest of the movie-going world, though. We all know the story of this great luxury liner sinking to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean on that chilly April evening in 1912. The substantial loss of life still ranks among the great human tragedies of recent history (9/11, Pearl Harbor, etc). Cameron spared no cost of either time or money to make the ship and its furnishings look exactly as they would have on that maiden voyage. In terms of technical detail, this film is without peer.The cast is generally appealing. Leo DiCaprio is far from a world-class actor, but his enthusiastic and earnest portrayal of Jack Dawson couldn't have been done better. Kate Winslet looks right in her element as a pampered young debutant trying to brake away from her boring life consisting of endless dinners and tea parties. Kathy Bates as ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown"" is always likeable and the rest of the cast (mostly Brits) does a good job of filling out their respective roles of cast and crew. Billy Zane gives the film's best performance as Winslet's greedy, snobbish fiancee. He is one of our most underrated actors. And you have to love David Warner as his bodyguard/enforcer.   As far as the special effects go, it's hard to imagine the sinking of the ship could have been filmed any better. Each time you view it, you seem to get a different perspective of just how lucky any of those passengers were to survive not only the actual sinking, but waiting around in life boats for help to arrive. As of this writing, only three known survivors are still alive. One can only imagine how many countless hours it took to conceive of, shoot, and edit the last hour of the film. The results are terrific.There are flaws in the overall mix, however. Some of the dialogue (Mostly Leo's) is down right corny. ""When you've got nothing, you've got nothing to lose!"" or ""You seem like kind of an indoor girl"" are two examples. Also, the notion that a guy from steerage class could go up and mingle with the first class passengers under any circumstances is not plausable. Keep in mind that a first class ticket on Titanic in today's economy would go for $80,000! These were some RICH people, and they wouldn't have let a guy like Dawson near them.Anyone who watches this film will have to endure numerous scenes of sappy romance. This film is a romance above all else. Just tough it out if it bothers you. It's not that bad.This film is tragic, exciting, sensual, pretentious, corny, extravagant, and even a little cheesy. And I love EVERY DAMN MINUTE OF IT!!!!!!!!5 of 5 stars.So sayeth the Hound.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The most overrated film ever made,"I went to see this movie after hearing only rave reviews and good things about it.  I thought it must be an unbelievable movie.  I was in for a surprise...Many people still believe that Titanic is the best film ever made.  It's not a particularly bad film...the acting is good and it's arguably well directed. The first half of the movie, the set up of the love triangle, is semi-interesting, but then the second half is different.  They try to make you really care about Jack and Rose and want them to live through the inevitable sinking of the ship.  (That's one thing that bothers me about true stories: you already know what's going to happen...)  The acting was decent, but the characters were not written deeply enough for me to really care whether or not they die.  The second half of the movie is the ship sinking.  Amazing effects on this half.  I guess it did a good job of showing how horrible it must have been to be there, and it was meant to be suspenseful and maybe even scary, but I actually got bored.  The audience was already aware that a lot of people were going to die, but the movie spends about an hour showing the many different ways the sinking of the Titanic could have killed someone.  I remember watching the Academy Awards and thinking, ""Well, Titanic is going to win,"" and everyone else already knew this, but almost everyone agrees with the Academy's choice.  There were many great movies that year: L.A. Confidential and Good Will Hunting were both better movies than this was, in my opinion.  Titanic just didn't hold my interest the way many, many other movies have.  So if you are easily impressed and not a big movie watcher, then you'll probably enjoy this movie.  But to me, it was the most disappointing movie ever.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"The Best Epic Film Since Ben-Hur. A timeless, moving classic that needs to be acknowledged!","This is EXACTLY what I think: It annoys me when people say they don't like this movie. Yes, it might not be a masterpiece but this was a damn good cinematic achievement. Ben-Hur has a higher rating than this and it's about a man and his encounter with Jesus. If they have an epic with Jesus mentioned that is IN the IMDb top 250, then they should have this movie in the Top 250. This was a very realistic movie. Yes, James Cameron might have stretched some issues but they are very plausible.I always tear up when the music gets intense (anyone who has seen this, will know what I mean) or when I hear the Academy Award winning song that was in this movie (My Heart Will Go On) I tear up. This is the ONLY movie that has made me cry. I don't think I'll find another epic like this that'll make me cry.I've watched about 3/4 of all the movies in the Top 250 and at the very least HALF of them are unworthy of the place they are in. Hell, about a third of what I watched ought not to be on this list but maybe 150 places above the Bottom 100 and that's me being nice.People just have to watch this movie with ABSOLUTELY NO BIASED OPINION or preconceived notion that they heard it was bad. That's how I came to love it. It's now my favorite movie of all time.The effects are the best I've seen since the epics of the 50s. The acting was brilliant and Gloria Stuart should have won Best Supporting Actress for Old Rose. Hell, Kathy Bates should have grabbed a nomination at least. Not a win, but just a nomination. Maybe Victor Garber should have gotten a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. The same with Jonathan Hyde. That's how believable I think this was. The second movie to win 11 Oscars in cinematic history and THE highest grossing movie of all time.

The real story of the sinking of the Titanic.,"The Titanic Was Sunk Deliberately To Create The Federal Reserve
In 1898 a man named Morgan Robertson penned a book titled ""Wreck of the Titan"" about a luxury liner deemed unsinkable that was going too fast in the North Atlantic in April and hit and iceberg killing most everyone on board due to lack of lifeboats.John Jacob Astor IV, the richest man in the world at the time, a friend of Nikola Tesla, and an outspoken opponent of the creation of the Federal Reserve.

Titanic is the most beautiful and tragic story humans have ever told,"I first saw Titanic as a child and remember liking it, mom used to listen to the soundtrack at home growing up, then I saw the movie again in 2012 for the hundred year anniversary of the sinking and loved it, I actually became very obsessed with it back then and my high school friends even made fun of me for it. Then in February this year I watched it again in IMAX and was blown away. This movie does not get old. Such a masterpiece. At the end of the film the girl next to me cried for 5 minutes as the credits flew by. Not a dry tear duct in that cinema. THAT'S WHAT MOVIE MAGIC IS ALL ABOUT BABY! Something about Titanic reminds us all of true love. Jack and Rose's romance is true love put into action amidst class divides and tragedy. James Horner's score makes me Hornee, absolutely beautiful.

Wow,"OK, so somehow I've managed to get to the age of 27 never having seen Titanic. Sure I know people love it, it won all the Oscars, it's constantly talked about, but I just kept thinking ""can it really be that good, surely it's over-hyped""... reader, it really is that good.The love story between Jack and Rose is just so engaging. So much so I was willing the ship not to sink so I could watch more of it. The chemistry between DiCaprio and Winslet is spot on and I was so drawn in by the story they were telling. Just wonderful.Then there's the actual sinking of the Titanic which is expertly retold by Cameron. You feel every moment of dread and panic. It makes for a harrowing and powerful watch and also a visual spectacle.The set design and costume etc are all superb. You totally feel like you are on the ship and thrust into the time period.Also, considering it is over three hours long, James Cameron manages to make it fly by. I must admit the length of the film always kind of put me off watching it but rest assured it does not feel long at all, such is the technical mastery and the brilliant story.Fantastic score too.Titanic is one of those films where, if like me you have put off watching it, you should remedy that as soon as possible.

Love Never Dies,"The film's attention to detail and production design is simply breathtaking. The grandeur of the Titanic is expertly portrayed, and the film's recreation of the ship's interiors and exteriors is nothing short of stunning. The special effects and practical effects used to bring the ship to life are equally impressive, and the sinking of the ship is one of the most memorable scenes in cinema history.However, it is the performances of the lead actors that truly make Titanic a masterpiece. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet have incredible chemistry on screen, and their performances are emotionally charged and nuanced. Their portrayal of two people from different worlds who fall in love despite the odds is touching and heartbreaking.In addition to the romance, the film also features strong supporting performances from a talented ensemble cast that includes Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, and Frances Fisher.Titanic is a timeless classic that continues to resonate with audiences today. Its stunning visuals, expertly crafted story, and powerful performances make it a cinematic masterpiece that is sure to be remembered for generations to come. It is a film that should be seen by everyone, and its impact on cinema cannot be overstated.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The Movie about people who make stupid choices and the ships that punish them,"So, bit of backstory for me and this movie. When I was but a wee moviegoer my birthday came around and there were two big movies playing: Titanic and Flubber. At that age? I wanted to see Flubber, hands down, no question. We saw Titanic. Ever since then, I've had something of an unfair distaste for this one but recently I thought, ""It's been years, Cameron made it... I need to give it a fair chance.""Well, I can comfortably say that while I don't think it's for me, I was unfair to this as a child. It really lives up to the Cameron pedigree of being just absolutely gorgeous. The way he made that ship feel, the size of it, the grandeur is just the kind of master craft we come to expect of the man. The cast deliver solid performances throughout, there's a proper sense of drama, even though we all know how it's going to play out.Where it loses me is in the over-the-top nature of the love story. It feels like he's going for a Shakespearean, Romeo and Juliet type of romance epic and I just can't help but feel it's over the top. Beyond that, I could really do without the whole modern aspect of the story. I just feel like it slows stuff down and doesn't really bring anything to the story.Whelp, child me was wrong. This is a pretty solid movie, stunning to look at but is a little too cloying for my tastes still. I will no longer actively avoid it, won't flip the channel if it happens to be on. Can't say I'll be seeking it out again anytime soon, but who knows.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"Well Done, yet over rated","James Francis Cameron's Titanic is a well done film, but I think it gets more credit than it deserves.  True, the film won eleven Academy awards (including 3 for Cameron and 2 for composer James Horner), but I think it shouldn't had been ranked so high- like with Ben-Hur status.If you don't know the story of Titanic now, your probably one of the ones who didn't survive because the story is world-renoun.  So are it's actors (Leonardo DiCaprio is not at his best, Kate Winslet is at least hot, and Billy Zane works as a villain) who work into Jim Cameron's script about romance on the high seas.  Luckily, the film doesn't go as slow as you may think, but still, that's no excuse to have the Titanic sinking in the movie longer than it did in  real life.But seriously, this film does have many great qualitites.  The story is well lay out, and the special effects are dazzling (it actually looks like the Titanic is sinking) which also won a Oscar.  One of the great points in this film is the score by James Horner which is his best and one of the best ever, but that is over-shadowed by fancy fireworks and bad acting.  Good direction though.

Revisiting the classic Titanic,"In the past, I was unable to comprehend Jack; I always assumed that he was a romantic lad with liberal ideas who enjoyed leading an unrestrained life. The maxim ""To make each day count"" appealed to me because I desired adventure and independence. There is no purpose in focusing only on love because life is harsh and not a haven for those looking for pleasure. Thinking back on the entire movie, Jack's words and deeds eventually made it clear to me that he is the one who knows the most about love and life. He was the one who taught Rose how to love and live her life to the fullest. In addition to being Rose's lover, Jack Dawson served as her spiritual supporter. He cared for her until she was grey and helped her recall when she was unable to walk anymore: ""There was a man named Jack Dawson, and that he saved me in every way that a person can be saved.""",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"""Good Will Hunting"" and ""L.A.

Let's face it, if DiCaprio isn't in the cast, this movie doesn't break the records. The performances were all half-way decent at best (I could have played Jack, it was that difficult of a part). But the special effects were nice. The plot was textbook romance and there was nothing surprising, even when Jack died. All in all, this movie was ok. I give it a 6 out of 10. If you want to see a real Cameron movie see ""True Lies"". That's a movie that has got it all. Fun, action, comedy, and a surprise here and there. Finally the main reason this movie could have been better is if the screenplay was better. ""Good Will Hunting"" won for best screenplay in '97 and they deserved it a lot more.

Dramatic and Heartbreaking...,"Titanic, is a movie about love, the dramatic Titanic sink, difference between the rich and the poor and how people are only thinking about themselves. The movie is perfect in any way, including the acting, action, plot, camera-filming and much, much more. This is the first time I am watching Titanic, and I am impressed that this movie was better than I expected. In this movie, the rich and the poor people, for different reasons, are traveling from England to New York with Titanic. This is also based on true story, by the way. They are showing the romance of a rich girl and a poor boy, that they are loving each other, but it is difficult when the two stages of richdom are combining each other. When the catastrophe begins, you can see how the rich people only cared about themselves, not the others. The characters where played very well, including Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) it was a fantastic duo in this movie, and the rest of the characters where also played well and they made a great expression. James Cameron is making most of his movies great, very long movies usually, but he is still using the time well and not wasting it like some directors like to do.

"nice sinking, bad love story","After reading the other comments, I was glad there is such a common consent and unanimity on the fact that the part about the ship was good while the plot, particularly the love story, was naive and boring.   Even the dialogue is interesting and relatively witty in the parts about the ship and the characters other than Jack and Rose, while all conversation between the two lovers is boring and naive.  I am surprised there wasn't much effort in creating a more mature and deeper love story, especially with the effort put in the movie as a whole.  James Cameron  did a very good job directing the ship and her sinking, characters like Moly Brown were amusing but there was nothing special about the main characters.  I wonder what was behind the choice of Leonardo DiCaprio for that role, given his young look (One expected a more mature looking man).

Titanic....my favorite movie of all time.,"I usually do not write reviews for movies, I'll rather just rate them. But this film is different. I NEED to talk about this film. I've loved this film ever since I was 6-7 years old, and I haven't stopped loving it since. Titanic is a masterpiece beyond levels. When it comes to the first half, were introduced to a romance/love story, which is just the heart of the movie. The film then needles through the past and present with breathtaking transitions. Then the second half of the film is basically a disaster movie, which some of the most heartbreaking moments introduced to film. Everything is so believable and so atmospheric. James Cameron is so talented as a director and as a writer when it comes to this film, his talent was very much noticed. This film is just....so masterful and so well made.

"Great Acting, Great Special Effects, but Crummy Story","At the time of its release, the world seemed to fall in love with both Leo and Kate, therefore any movie they made was a masterpiece. And while I can't fault their acting, or all the work that went into this recreation of the 1912 disaster, I'll have to say that the story itself is pretty shallow.True love, my butt! You have a spoiled, entitled society girl, who's engaged to a wealthy, good looking g guy who adores her, and yet she has the colossal gall to compare her situation to enslaved people, and speak of the Titanic as her ""slave ship"". WTF!!!!! I'm surprised every PC SJW didn't get all up in arms about that remark! I think that was AWFUL!!! How come cancel culture never cancelled that????Also, this is a movie about infidelity, and disrespect. As she (finally) reaches the end of her life, Rose should be thinking about the man she married and raised a family with, not the guy she knew a couple of days aboard ship, that she wasted no time getting naked with (so much for her proper upbringing) and who, had he lived, she would NEVER have been happy with, despite the romantic ""soulmate"" idea, that in the modern world is a real joke.Watch a documentary on the ship instead, you'll learn more and skip the nonsense.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

It amazes me how modern American filmakers seem to delight in tearing down the society and values they have grown up in.

10/10,"It's been several decades since I had the chance to watch James Cameron's masterful epic, and watching it again after all this time, I can honestly say that my feelings haven't changed: this is an exhilarating film from top to bottom, from the magnificent visuals and a love story that deserves its place among Hollywood's best.For starters, the entire cast is a knockout, with appearances by actors such as Bill Paxton, Kathy Bates, Maggie Smith, and Billy Zane, to name a few, but it's Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio's magnetic performances where Titanic truly shines.Despite being victim to countless parodies over the years, the spark between Rose and Jack remains every bit as powerful. There's also a surprising amount of humor - I especially loved the moments we see Rose abandon her ""polite girl"" status in order to help Jack, or when people begin breaking down gates or doors in order to navigate their way out of the ship.Director James Cameron truly hit a grand slam visually, and seeing that ship captured in such a beautiful and expansive light was every bit as exciting as I remember seeing in the theater. Now that I've aged a bit since then, watching the sinking of the ship made me realize why this is such a long movie - it takes time for the entire event to unfold, making the infamous tragedy all the more nerve-wracking. The entire final act is one of the most beautifully staged and thrilling sequences the movies have given us, with tension becoming higher and higher as the water slowly makes its way through the ship, and the panic and chaos among the passengers rising to terrifying heights.All in all, TITANIC certainly earned its place among cinema's finest moments. It's an exciting and emotional ride that hasn't lost its glow, and I'm beyond happy to have been able to watch this again, despite my own reservations.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Still Holds Up After 15 Years,"Titanic (1997)**** (out of 4)James Cameron's Oscar-winning love story about star crossed lovers (Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet) who come from different back grounds but fall in love aboard the Titanic. I remember seeing this on its opening weekend and it's amazing to see how well the film holds up after all these years. Yes, since it became so popular there are always going to be those who hold that against the film and while it's far from a masterpiece I do think it holds up quite nicely against many of the classic epics that have been made since D.W. Griffith's THE BIRTH OF A NATION. That film, GONE WITH THE WIND, BEN HUR and other epics were all grand on scale, told big stories with big effects and each of them had flaws here and there.The most amazing thing about TITANIC is the way Cameron is able to tell the fake story and mix it in with so many real-life people and events. Since 1997 I've watched countless documentaries on the real subject and watching the film on its re-release made me appreciate it so much more. The little details given about certain real-life people was a major plus and so were the smaller touches. The amount of love and detail that Cameron puts into every single shot of the movie makes it very poetic and at any time you can't help but just look around and try to take in everything in the frame. Very few films have gone all-in with their subject matters but this here goes for everything and just comes up short at a few times. It certainly helps that you have two strong leads turning in fine performance.Winslet was clearly the best of the bunch as she brings so much life to her character and perfectly manages to fit every side of her. Be it the rich, spoiled girl, the confused one, the heroic side or the love story aspect. I was less than thrilled with DiCaprio when I first saw the movie but looking back on the movie he too really stands out and delivers. Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Bill Paxton and Gloria Stuart also deliver.I think the biggest flaws in the film can be had in the screenplay. Many people objected to having the fake characters so close to the real ones during the finale but this here didn't bother me too much as when we see the real people it's in situations based on what we're led to believe happened. What bothered me in 1997 and today is that Cameron decided to make Zane the main villain over the iceberg. I really think the story starts of go overboard during the third act as Leo gets chained up and then we have more drama wrapped around the real event. There's no question that the romance made this movie such a hit but I think it could have worked with everyone had the stuff with Zane been toned down. God knows there was enough drama with the sinking to make up for Zane running around with a gun. With that said, that's about the only problem with TITANIC and those things aren't disastrous enough to ruin the movie. There's no question that the romance works, the special effects are terrific and on the whole this is just a movie that works on every level.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Good movie but overrated!,"So much has been said about Titanic that it's hard to come up with anything new. Some people claim it's the greatest thing ever directed, others say one is too high of a rating. I fit in the middle. This movie had beautiful setting and scenery, some gorgeous shots of the ocean and the sunset. Three thumbs up to those who shot those scenes. And this movie DID have a plot, it didn't need to be three hours long, but non the less it was present. Titanic was a tragedy and this movie was not a celebration of it, it tried to put a story to it which it did. Although the characters were fictional, perhaps stories of the sort did happen (certainly not as dramatic though).Characters could of been a little more developed because with the exception of Sally Brown they were all black and white. I personally really liked the reactions of different people to what was happening on the ship. Nobility of the captain, mother's prayers, musicians attitude etc. Cameron very well portrayed those people.Something was missing from the plot however, it in a way lacked emotions. As I watching this movie, I realized that what was happening on that ship was awful, but I didn't get a sense of reality from it. I didn't feel the horror to the bones and I certainly didn't feel the pain of those people who were drowning. I mean, I knew it was there, I just didn't experience everything they did emotionally, and a good movie should make a person do that.I don't think this movie deserved an Oscar but it still deserved attention as a good movie with imperfections. After all, very few movies are flawless.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Visually, Titanic was a stunning masterpiece, but the story and the acting were mediocre and sometimes just outright bad.","At first glance, Titanic is an epic film. The scenery and cinematogrpahy are spectacular, and it is just a beautifully photographed movie. However, when you look past the superficial beauty of the film, much like Armageddon, its numerous shortcomings become clear. First of all, Titanic suffered badly from the transition from the big screen to video. This took away a lot of the hugeness of the film, and this inadvertently places more attention on the story and the acting, both of which were the biggest problems with the film. I went to see this movie to see the sinking of the Titanic, not to see some elaborately fabricated love story.Titanic is a landmark film as a result of the sinking of the ship and the fact that it inexplicably turned out to be such a huge moneymaker. There is absolutely nothing great about the acting, the story is nothing that hasn't been seen dozens of times before, and the directing is awkward, probably due to the fact that James Cameron, who is an excellent director, is so used to directing the Frankenstein-like Schwarzenegger as the Terminator. This is not to say that the directing was bad, it wasn't at all, but there is nothing special to be said about the directing because James Cameron is not really a director of this type of film.Kate Winslet was beautiful in Titanic. She delivered a wonderful performance in the film and was very convincing, as was Kathy Bates (as always) and even Billy Zane. I normally don't like him, but he was playing a dislikeable character, which is probably why I enjoyed his performance so much. Leonardo DiCaprio, however, delivered the worst performance of his career. If you want to see him really act, watch The Basketball Diaries or, even better, The Beach.Titanic is a beautifully made film. It suffered in the story and the acting departments, but it is an entertaining and easy to watch movie. It was not, however, the best picture of 1997. Not even close. There were probably 20 movies that were released in 1997 that were better than Titanic, but the Oscar's wouldn't have gained as much public support had they not given the Oscar to Titanic. It was a quality film, but don't be fooled by all of the hype.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

I'm surprised that its rating here on IMDB is 7.0Considering the rabid fan base, and the fact that you could NOT escape that horrid theme song for forever, I would have thought it was an awesome movie.When push comes to shove, it's an OK movie, but it's neither AWESOME nor TERRIBLE.In short, it is a 7.0 movie, I guess.The first half is the best, the second half falls apart completely. I guess it just goes to show that the more money you pour into a project, the more you can get out.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Titanic for the romance.,"So aside from its sweeping spectacle and moving depiction of real-life tragedy, what does the story of Jack and Rose bring to the table? In spite of how persuasive the film is, one must remember - it's ultimately a work of fiction, not a documentary. Like any period drama, it is an interpretation of how society worked at the time. Jack and Rose, as well as being beautifully played by DiCaprio and Winslet, are incredibly well crafted. They are a window into a much more subtle form of racism, which is still prevalent today. It's called class, and in the latter half of the movie, it becomes a tool with which to decide who lives and who dies.First of all, just look at this film. The resplendent wonder of the film's set design, both interior and exterior, places you right on board. It looks and feels the part. And when the inevitable disaster strikes, Cameron grabs onto you and drags you through each painful moment in striking detail. The sinking of the Titanic is brought to life with exquisite attention to detail and astonishing visual effects. It makes for the greatest disaster scenes in any movie I've seen.Titanic has pretty much anything you can ask for. It's a romance; it's a disaster movie; it's an action film; it's got a sense of humour and wit; it's a period drama; it's a tragedy. Summed up, Titanic is about as perfect a cinematic experience as you're ever likely to get.The performances just take your breathe away. Jack and Rose's love story is so full of life and heart and what true love should be even if it's a battle or your not the same class and can't be together ounce you find your soulmate that's what love is about. Their characters felt so human and that really is what puts this movie at a whole new level. The camerawork is some of the best I have ever seen in any film. I don't even want to spoil how thrilling, chilling, beautifully well done the Titanic sinking part of the film is because it is something you just have to see for yourself and experience the devastating heartbreaking tragedy that occurred.So as much as our culture remembers Titanic for the romance, fittingly the deepest theme of this movie about so many tragic deaths is finding the will to live. In order for Rose to recapture her will to live, she needs to honestly face what's wrong in her life and cut that out. Committing to being alive means committing to living authentically as oneself.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A grand epic,"Of all the epics this world has seen, Titanic is perhaps the grandest and most timeless experience we've seen. Not only is the story of the Titanic's sinking told with great emotion and intelligence, but the movie itself stands out as one of the greatest movie's there has ever been.11 Oscars and nearly 2 billion dollars landmark this film in cinema history, and it's not hard to see why. The script is solid, the acting is great, the visual effects are excellent and the score is perfect. Movies like this are rare, and we haven't seen films like this since the likes of Gone with the Wind. There are only a few movies that can compare to these movies, such as Lord of the Rings, and I, for one, can't get enough of them.

What I think about this movie.,"I saw Titanic last night for the first time. Before watching it, I believed it was only a over hyped film for stupid girls who love DiCaprio's smart face. But...It's not so at all...I think Titanic is a very pleasant film, well directed, technically perfect, touching but not pathetic. Ok, the plot isn't original and it is a bit stereotyped( the old story of a poor guy who falls in love with an aristocratic girl ) , DiCaprio was really better inspired in Romeo+Juliet than in this film and , of course , Titanic is NOT the greatest movie ever appeared but , however , it deserves to be seen without prejudices(at least to enjoy all the marvellous digital effects).",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Titanic,"I must say, I enjoyed the film more then I thought I would after all this time later. We all know the story of the titanic and the horrific events that caused the ship to sink. The film does a good job with showing that while still showing a good story. It's a story about society- simple rich vs poor. Which is very unfortunate. A privileged young lady that is about to marry a wealthy man finds love while on the ship with a simple man that literally only has the clothes on his back. But he shows her money is not everything. They immediately click and have a great bond but unfortunately the titanic was doomed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Years from now, people will look back and wonder why.","Why did James Cameron go to so much trouble making a film that presented the physical and visual dimensions of Titanic and take the human dimensions on a fantasy-romp of titanic-sized contrivances? There are enough historical documents and memoirs about REAL people on that ship who had REAL lives and some were actually very compelling.  So why did Cameron opt to give these REAL people bit parts and invent two shallow characters?Good acting and high production values go a long way to cover up a poor script, and Titanic is proof of that with the Oscar frenzy that surrounded it (However, it was the first film in a long time that did not earn a screenplay nomination and won best picture).  Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet both did excellent jobs acting as did Gloria Stuart and Kathy Bates. They all deserved an Oscar in light of what they had to work with on the page.  How conventional, shallow and contrived does this sound?  Rose is in what is for all intents and purposes an arranged marriage, but she is really a free spirit ready to fly away from her upper-class roots.  If it wasn't for her darn mother.  Now to make this issue even more clear, her fiance is controlling and abusive.  The decision is clear.  She has to fall for Jack, a fellow free spirit who shows her real love.  Alas, Jack must be symbolically sacrificed so she can avoid being drowned in her life and truly find freedom in the new land.  Not only are the mechanics of the script clear, but the story is old and tired.  Titanic works because it plays on stereotypical conventions and latent emotions; it does not earn its emotional climax on its own merit.  This subject has the opportunity to be so much more genuine and powerful if only someone had taken the time to look beyond fictional romance and into true life tragedy.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"Overrated?  Slightly, But Not By Much","`Titanic' has a large number of fans that will cheerfully proclaim that it is the best movie ever made, and a large number of detractors who will cheerfully proclaim that is nothing but puerile, overrated garbage.  The truth lies somewhere in between - `Titanic' definitely shouldn't have won the Best Picture Oscar in 1997 (), but to dismiss the film as utter crap is very unfair.  `Titanic' tells a complex tale, and, for the most part, tells it very well.  The fact that parts of this tale are either predictable or flawed shouldn't be ignored, but it also isn't enough to turn `Titanic' into a rotten movie.`Titanic' has a slightly predictable story, but most films involving a well-known historical event tend to be predictable.  Before the movie even starts, anybody watching `Titanic' should be able to predict a few things: The Titanic will set sail in glorious fashion, with its owners grandly proclaiming its unsinkable nature; there will be a story about the passengers, some fictional, some real; the Titanic will sink in a slow and horrible fashion; and while the ship sinks, the characters will be forced to deal with their own mortality, and some will be heroes while others will be craven cowards.  See?  Predictable.  It doesn't take a genius to realize that the historical nature of `Titanic' dictates this story structure. After all, it's the structure James Cameron actually uses.  But the execution of that structure . . . well, that takes some talent, if the film has any aspirations of being good.  It means blending action, romance, drama, and historical accuracy.  And James Cameron blends them all splendidly.The main story concerns a young girl named Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet), traveling to America in order marry an arrogant millionaire named Cal Hockley (Billy Zane).  The marriage, which has been arranged by her formerly rich and now-destitute mother (Frances Fisher), is abhorrent to Rose, so in a desperate attempt to escape her fate, she attempts to jump off the ship.  Of course, she doesn't jump, but is instead saved by the happy-go-lucky Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), and of course the two begin a brief, if implausible, romance.  This romance, which is perhaps the weakest part of `Titanic' is still vitally important to the story . . . because it gives the audience a very strong reason to care about these characters when the ship hits the iceberg, and about the choices they make. Could it have been better?  Absolutely.  But considering that the romance is a means to an end, rather than the end itself, it's not bad.DiCaprio is superb as the wide-eyed vagabond Jack Dawson - he brings enough earnest enthusiasm to the role to make it totally believable as to why Rose would fall in love so quickly with him.  Winslet's slightly less believable, though; she's good, but not great.  She puts in a nice, quiet, restrained performance, but it's so restrained at times that it borders on comatose. It's actually the minor characters that add some zip to `Titanic' - Billy Zane is outstanding as the villain Hockley, as he gives Hockley enough human nuances to make him seem like a flawed, arrogant person, and not just some standard bad guy ripped straight out of a Flash Gordon serial.  Also worthy of note is the modern-day interaction between deep-sea explorer Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) and the elderly Rose (Gloria Stuart), floating on an exploration ship far above the watery grave of the Titanic.  No only does their interaction serve as a brilliant, unobtrusive way of relaying the historical facts about the Titanic's final hours to the audience, but Paxton also manages to become a surrogate for the audience - as the movie unfolds and gets more and more interesting, it's a neat touch to see his character Lovett become more and more fascinated with Rose's stories.It would be remiss not to mention the special effects of `Titanic', which by and large is the film's strength. While the ship (and its sinking) is a product of CGI effects and model works, it's done it such a realistic manner that it never calls attention to itself, or reminds the audience that they're watching a movie. Of more importance is that the film's effects, while spectacular, never ARE the film - they always SUPPORT the film's story.There are many things to nit-pick about `Titanic' (although I find it hard to believe that people really nit-pick the minor historical inaccuracies of the film; Cameron got all the major details right, and the films probably more than 95% accurate, for crying out loud).  But those problems are nit-picks - very tiny but slightly irritating details, nothing more.  They keep the film from being an all-time great, but they certainly don't make it a bad film.  The blend of romance, action, history, and special effects probably explains the film's vast appeal - there's certainly something for everyone in this film - and it also makes `Titanic' an excellent, if not perfect, movie.  Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Good enough,"As someone interested in titanic history, I like to see movies based on the event. However, I can't say this is the best movie in terms of acting, CGI or plot development. Kate Winslet whines her way to an average performance. I'm not sure why she was picked to be the lead female. DiCaprio does a good job but not his best work. Billy Zane is also weird casting choice and he isn't exactly great. The best actor/actress performance in the movie is probably Gloria Stewart. The CGI is not good, I know it was early in the game but some of it looks bad for 90's standards. I do like the movie being a wide stream outlet for knowledge on the titanic. However, the breaking of the ship is very inaccurate in the movie. The stern did not settle that high before the structural failure. Otherwise all the water sinking the ship looked nice. The grand staircase was particularly lovely. That scene alone makes this at least a 5.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

No Night to Remember,"I hesitate to write anything at all, since there are already more than 400 entries on this site. So let me just pop off the first few things that come to mind... 1)Hardly ""Best Picture"" caliber. As has already been noted, the dialog is ridiculous; the leads have no romantic chemistry; and - most shocking of all - the fx really aren't worthy of the hype. The sinking is impressively staged, but scenes of the Titanic underway don't seem much more credible than a lot of back-projected stuff coming out of Hollywood six decades ago. The computer-generated pans of the ship and the ocean are staggeringly obvious. 2)Billy Zane must give one of the most unbearable performances in film history. Granted, Cameron's script gives him nothing to work with; the viewer who noted he seems to be playing Satan has it just right. The scenes where he shoots (!) repeatedly at Jack on the Grand Staircase (wouldn't the list on the ship make it pretty damn hard to navigate the staircase by this point?) and uses a child to ensure his place on a lifeboat are just idiotic. I found myself grimacing every time I looked at Zane's sallow face and slanted eyes; this brand of villainy went out in pictures - I don't know - about the time of the real Titanic sank. 3)The leads are pretty hapless; and the fact they are able to spend so much time submerged in freezing water while unlocking doors, wielding axes, etc. beggars credibility. 4)A lot of the supporting roles are well-played. David Warner doesn't fall into the trap of over-acting like Zane does, and comes off quite well as the villainous valet. He seems to be having fun, which is pretty much all an actor can do in a flick like this. Gloria Stuart is extremely effective as Old Rose; she more-or-less singlehandedly endows the film with all its human pathos. I also enjoyed Bill Paxton's performance. He etched pretty effectively the character of a jaded adventurer. If only he had some decent dialog to work with. Victor Garber - a very fine actor - is wasted as Thomas Andrews. He is invariably excellent in all his scenes. 5)Folks who take umbrage to the fictional characters would do well to remember a similar framework was used with Clifton Webb and Barbra Stanwyck as an estranged fictional couple in Negulesco's 1953 Titanic. 6)WHERE WAS THE CALIFORNIAN? If you're looking for a movie villain, this ship fits the bill. The decision to cut scenes set on the derelict vessel is really regrettable. 7)On the whole, a decent, passable picture, with many striking images and a great last hour. But it pales in comparison with the 1958 ""A Night to Remember,"" which better captured the human drama of the ship's final moments. On the other hand, far better than the Stanwyck-Webb opus.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Epic melodrama with superior set design and special effects,"Titanic is a marvellous, expansive film with the first rate special effects you expect from James Cameron, lending the feeling of vastness and realism you would feel. Lead acting performances are uniformly well done, though the dialogue they have to work with is disappointing. The film is hampered by an unimaginative screenplay, with trite dialogue and poor situations. But the film starts of well enough. The first one half or two hours are enthralling and even breezy, doing well to hide the films poor writing, and are a joy to watch. After this however, the tender love story which has played out is replaced with frantic, frenzy action for the next hour or so. This is the section after the ship strikes the iceberg, as the film attempts to, like a typical Hollywood film, milk every single situation and obstacle they can. This, rather than being suspenseful, just felt boring, languid, and contrived. Thankfully, the film reverts to tenderness in the last 20 minutes, with jack and rose on a piece of wood and the famous ending. The problematic bits of the film are hence those where Jack and rose are engaged in action rather than romance. Hence, I think the movie is overlong, and should've been trimmed down at the parts mentioned. Regardless, Titanic of course, is still a titanic film, with a doomed love story, and beautiful special effects, one definitely well worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"Stunning, powerful, and magnificent, in every way","Even if one missed the proverbial boat when it first launched, and sits to watch this titan very belatedly, it's nonetheless all but impossible to do so without full awareness. The movie holds a place in culture for which there are dashingly few points of comparison: the real-life history, the production history, every last facet of the movie itself, the reactions, awards, jokes, memes, parodies, and so on. Even still, on all accounts - its place in culture, its place in cinema, its accolades and acclaim, and not least on its own merits - there comes a time where it behooves one to watch 'Titanic' for ourselves. Over twenty-six years my expectations have ranged from mixed to high, but I have to say, this really does make a huge impression, right from the start, and proves itself all throughout its substantial length. For all that could be said of this film, and has been in the past two and a half decades, it really is a terrific modern classic, well deserving of its great esteem.There are many flavors throughout these 190 minutes, some coming off better than others. One could remark on how the tale of the RMS Titanic and its fate is romanticized, or how heavy-handed it approaches concurrent themes - all too relevant to real life, contemporary and modern - of classism, deep-seated sexism, and the outright subjugation of women; haughtiness, pride, hubris, jealousy, selfishness, toxic masculinity; the vapidness of wealth and society versus the vitality of the working masses, and more. Some lines and scenes are entirely too on the nose, especially but not exclusively where they concern the ultimate doom of the vessel or those failures and oversights that contributed to the catastrophe; some moments are decidedly ham-handed, embracing kitsch; at some points I'm surprised by how much prominence is given to the present-day framing device. Any scenes that diverge even slightly from either the central romance, or the looming disaster, sometimes feel marginally extraneous, even including the framing and Hockley's abject villainy; at the same time, the swiftness and intensity of Jack and Rose's romance is a bit much at times.And yet for any nits that one may reasonably pick, there's also this: James Cameron penned an absolutely extraordinary screenplay. There's unexpected balance among all the varied parts: the thrills and much needed spark that Jack brings to Rose's life; the love and warmth of the all too brief love affair; joyful humor, shrewd wit, and sheer fun; the cold, hateful antagonism of Rose's fiance and his lackey; the magnitude and gravity of the accident, the protracted sinking, and the excruciatingly tragic loss of life; the reminiscence that frames the core tale. Every beat of the narrative, and every component part that's woven in, is written with wonderful sagacity, and a mind for delicacy, tact, and nuance. Every character and line of dialogue (even those of a less pristine flavor as noted), and more importantly every scene, is written with fantastic intelligence to ensure every moment carries with it the utmost possible vibrancy and impact. Truly, the screenplay is exceptionally smart and well-rounded - and Cameron's direction is at least as grand, shaping every passing minute with an exquisite eye for detail. The result of all this isn't just a historical drama, or a love story - it's a disaster flick, but in contrast with the effects-laden extravaganzas that mostly just revel in destruction, this is one in which we're made to earnestly feel each and every dire moment, and the urgent human cost of such terrible events. For that, 'Titanic' might actually be the best disaster film we've ever been given.But by Jove, this is barely scraping the surface of everything that makes this such a tremendous, enduring picture. There are more familiar, recognizable names and faces in the cast than it even seems at first blush, and while Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio get all the focus, this is to say nothing of Billy Zane, Frances Fisher, Gloria Stuart, Bill Paxton, David Warner, Kathy Bates, Bernard Hill, Eric Braeden, Ioan Gruffudd, and still more. Everyone - sincerely, everyone - gives marvelous performances that very ably capture every mood, from the lightest to the darkest. Nevertheless, the actors may rather be outshone by the utterly outstanding contributions of everyone working behind the scenes. The feature represented a famously enormous production - replicas, models, sets, stunts, and practical effects all as huge as the ship itself - and every last trace simply looks incredible. I dare say the crew are the real stars, for the immensity of every last piece is just plain dazzling; it can't be understated what a magnificent job they all pulled together. I understand that there are some disputes as to the total historical accuracy of the costume design, yet even at that there can be no arguing that Deborah Lynn Scott assembled sartorial arrangements that are to die for; not to be counted out, the hair and makeup is lovely. Russell Carpenter's cinematography is stupendously rich, not to mention amazingly dynamic, crisp, vivid, and smooth, frankly rivaling Cameron's direction in its brilliance. Editing, sound, sound effects; even the post-production CGI is astoundingly keen, to be honest more seamless and realistic than even that of many titles that have followed in the years since. And what can one say of the music except for how perfect it is? Late great composer extraordinaire James Horner remains higher in my esteem than no few of his fellows in the industry, and the score he put together for 'Titanic' is super. Much of it works around the theme song that all know so well, ""My heart will go on,"" to gratifying success, but even setting that aside there are more odds and ends here that have worked their way into the public imagination than I first realized. Horner's music is unquestionably one of the endless highlights of so stellar a movie - and for as much as Celine Dion's rendition of ""My heart will go on"" has become a meme unto itself, it still stands as a beautiful, emotional song that holds definite power.For those various flavors that the writing boasts, some better than others, and for all those ways that the narrative may be stronger or weaker in select times, I quite think these are the only points of criticism of any real significance to be drawn. I'm hard-pressed to think of anything else that sticks out as a flaw, even noting how Cameron's magnum opus takes some liberties with historical record. Moreover, whatever notes one might make of ways in which the whole may be less than perfect: I sat to watch with expectations that ranged from mixed to high, and I'm completely blown away. This is even better than I could have hoped. I'm of the opinion that if this 1997 feature is less than perfect, it's a difference of tiny fractions, and not whole numbers. Part of me is stunned, and part of me is a sobbing mess, but in no part am I inclined to think of 'Titanic' as anything less than a gem - a finely cut diamond, if you will. To some degree I can't believe what I've missed out on for so long, though on the other hand, I don't think I'd have been able to appreciate this twenty-six years ago as much as I do now. When all is said and done I have nothing but praise to offer: this is a heartwarming, heartbreaking, powerful, staggering work of cinema, in every capacity, and it has fully earned all the lofty regard lavished upon it. 'Titanic' is, truly, a phenomenal film. Bravo!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Terrible and Overblown,"Best film ever, most certainly not. Best film of 1997, again not in with a chance. I have to report that while watching ""Titanic"" I found myself being totally bored by the stereotypical charecters, i.e Snobbish English, Battleaxe American. Cameron has also reeled out loads of cliches and made them 10 times more boring. There is also an undertone of class struggle which is direly executed. As for ""Titanic"" being called a love story, that could never be said as there was no chemistry between the two leads and to me no feelings of love came across (James try watching other Oscar nominee As Good As It Gets for a decent love story). As for the tragedy that was Titanic in the film I did not feel as though the tragedy was fully put across and I left actually feeling numb from this glamourised dross. How this truly terrible film managed to get the Best Film Oscar is beyond me (As Good As It Gets a much better and beautiful film) and how Cameron got the Best Director award is unbelievable although is unsurprising when people like Martin Scorsese do not get an Oscar for films such as Raging Bull, Goodfellas and Mean Streets.",2.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Beautiful masterpiece of cinematography,"Are you looking for a movie that will take you on an emotional rollercoaster? Look no further than the 1997 blockbuster hit, Titanic. This epic romance-drama is a must-see for anyone who loves a good story.From the moment the film begins, you are transported back in time to the early 1900s. The attention to detail in the set design and costumes is impeccable, making you feel as though you are truly on board the Titanic. The film's director, James Cameron, spared no expense in creating a world that is both beautiful and tragic.The story follows the journey of Jack Dawson, a poor artist, and Rose DeWitt Bukater, a wealthy socialite. Despite their different backgrounds, the two fall deeply in love during the voyage. Their romance is both heartwarming and heartbreaking, as they face numerous obstacles throughout the film.One of the most impressive aspects of Titanic is the incredible performances by the cast. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet have undeniable chemistry on screen, making their love story all the more believable. The supporting cast, including Billy Zane and Kathy Bates, also deliver standout performances.But Titanic is not just a love story. It is also a tale of tragedy and survival. The film's climax, when the Titanic hits an iceberg and begins to sink, is both thrilling and devastating. The special effects used to create the sinking ship are still impressive over 20 years later.Overall, Titanic is a cinematic masterpiece that has stood the test of time. It is a film that will make you laugh, cry, and feel every emotion in between. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and watch it as soon as possible. You won't regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

just press the fast forward button,"Watched it on the screen a few years back and could not sleep that night. I couldn't stop thinking about the poor people who drowned.The plot was not as interesting to me until the Titanic started to sink then the mood started to pick up.  i'm sorry that the characters were too one-dimensional to make me feel sorry for them when they drowned,  Kept wishing i knew more about them before they pulled the plug on the everything. . .I watched the documentary on cable channel then spurred me on to borrow the video.  The documentary made me cry more than the movie, amazingly. Watching it on video, I could watch the sinking bit 100 times, its the best! I just fast forward the whole middle section of the movie and watch the start and ending.  I can truly imagine myself sinking with the thousand plus desperate people, the special effects are truly convincing and fabulous! I cheered for the single lifeboat which went back and wonder what were the real stories of the 6 people whom they rescued?I'm very interested in discovering the stories of all the survivors and what really happened to the people who were on the Titanic because of this movie's attempts to recreate that fatal night.

An Odd Film in the James Cameron Canon,"A seventeen-year-old aristocrat (Kate Winslet), expecting to be married to a rich claimant (Billy Zane) by her mother, falls in love with a kind but poor artist (Leonardo DiCaprio) aboard the luxurious, ill-fated R.M.S. Titanic.The first thing that is really striking about this film is that it came from James Cameron, who is much better known for science fiction films like ""Terminator"", ""Avatar"" and ""Aliens"". He is not the first person that comes to mind when you think of historical fiction romances. And yet, he nailed it. ""Titanic"", despite its length of three hours, was a huge success and may have sold more VHS copies than any other movie.But beyond the romance, this is actually a rather decent movie. I cannot say why, it is something hard to put one's finger on. Most likely, it has something to do with Billy Zane, who is more or less the greatest thing about the film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"Epic, touching and absolutely timeless","An epic movie, which you will remember for the rest of your life after you'll watch it. Simply the kind of movie, which you can't describe in words, you have to watch it, at least once! , to see what we, the people who appreciate this movie, are talking about. After watching it for 3 times already in my life, i still can't believe i've seen a gigantic ship sinking in a film, with such an incredible realism. I heard there were used some test puppets to make it look like people were falling off the ship, well i haven't noticed any, everything looked so real, all the people that were falling and screaming for help. The fictional story about the 2 main characters, falling in love, is genially directed, some of the scenes are very touching, very well filmed. And the casting was great, i don't want to hear any stupid replies that DiCaprio is a bad actor, hell no ! Him and Kate Winslet both did a great job, there's no doubt about their acting skills whatsoever. Those who are calling this a bad movie, i hope you people never watch a movie ever again, cause i assume all you know is teenage comedies and horror movies. Also, please stop calling us ""pathetic titanic fan boys"", this is not twilight where 15 year old girls claim it to be the best movie because Robert Pattinson is part of the cast. I am a man, i watched this movie 3 times already, and i didn't cry, i just know how to appreciate a well made movie, WE, all of us that do, millions of people, much more then those of you that hate it, claim this to be a superb masterpiece. And the few of you that didn't enjoy it, i am glad, i am glad that you aren't capable of appreciating good movies, and i hope you stick with the genres i stated above, you didn't even deserve to watch it actually.

"25 years Later its still the only movie to win 11 oscars and be the number one watched, loved and remembered movie of all time","In the opening sequence of Titanic, a group of treasure hunters send a robotic probe far beneath the ocean's surface in search of treasures (and one particularly precious jewel) still tucked aboard the titular sunken ship. The camera attached to the probe reveals a vessel that's certainly rotted but still carries hints of its prior glory. The explorers coo and sigh as they see what's been waiting a century for them, as if they're looking at their dreams made manifest. This is the day they've fantasized about, and the treasures of people who once lived and loved aboard the RMS Titanic are their bounty. When the film was released, it was a gamble the size of ... well, the metaphors present themselves a bit too easily. It was a wild risk, both for filmmaker James Cameron (who was known for Aliens and his Terminator movies) and for the studios that funded it, Paramount and 20th Century Fox. Cameron's terrible temper and a runaway production with troubles to spare - one disgruntled crew member laced the chowder at craft services with PCP one night, provoking hallucinations in 50 people, including cast member Bill Paxton - had prompted people to wonder if the legendarily expensive film was doomed for the same fate as its subject. The production budget reportedly ran over $200 million, an enormous sum by any contemporary standards that was much more so in 1997. Titanic remained No. 1 at the North American box office for 15 weeks in a row. It was nominated for 14 Oscars and won 11 of them, including Best Picture. The movie continued playing in theaters for nearly an entire year, and didn't close until October 1, 1998, after earning $600 million in North America and twice that worldwide. It was the highest-grossing film of all time until 2010, when Cameron's Avatar wrested away the title. Titanic is two movies stitched together: a swoony teenage fantasy for the ages, and a massive disaster movie that rivals any disaster movie to come out of Hollywood either before or since. The lengthy runtime makes perfect sense by this rubric, and you can see the seam where the movie pivots from one to the other, almost exactly at the halfway mark. That Titanic is two movies in one is part of its genius: If it were just the romance, it might have been written off as a ""movie for girls,"" but then there's this whole other disaster element too. From a marketing perspective, that's gold.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
An all-time great film,"Beautiful, feel-good and touching movie. All those poor souls that knew it was their end, I cannot imagine the horror.

He leads her and he shares his life with her. He takes her places and he affectionately cares for her. He declares his feelings for her and they share romantic moments together.

Love is the source from which we come from.Life is a gift. It is up to each one of us to make the most of each day in our lives. The film conveys the message, live as though there is no tomorrow. For what is life without having lived it and experienced it to the fullest? In the end, what matters most is love. The love that sustains us, that gives us life. That makes us feel alive, cherished and safe.As I watched this film, my heart was deeply moved. Tears welled down my eyes. I felt what the characters were experiencing.

The worst film to ever win a best picture Oscar,"Checking out the other comments, one caught my eye... somebody had the gall to make a comparison between this film and Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece, ""The Seven Samurai"". To compare this film with ""The Seven Samurai"" is utterly rediculous and an insult to great films. With that said, I'll continue...Let me start off with the absolute horrid screenplay that is filled with cliches. While watching this film, you can pretty much tell what is going to happen next... it's the ""Rich girl forced to marry a rich guy, but she finds a poor boy that she eventually falls in love with"" story you've seen hundereds of times before.... add a big boat, a historical disaster, and bingo, you have yourself a movie. The dialogue is almost laughably bad (""Oh Jack.... Jack!""). And the characters are almost as cliche-ridden as the story they're in. As you watch the film, you feel almost as if you're forced to like the characters.A disaster as huge as the sinking of the Titanic doesn't deserve a film like this. It is an insult to the hundreds that died in that distaster to be represented in a stereotypical film such as this. And it's winning of the best picture oscar is absolute proof that the Oscars are nothing more than a huge popularity contest anymore. To even place this in the same category with films like ""On the Waterfront"", ""Ben-Hur"", ""The African Queen"", ""Rebecca"", ""The Godfather"", etc. is such a shame, and just shows you what direction the film industry is headed.About the only good thing I could say about this film is that it is an enormous technical achievement.

I hadn't watched it for many years until the past few days when I watched it a few times in a row, and really appreciated it on a deeper level I felt, or maybe just remembered how truly great it is.Sure it has its cinematic flaws, such as seeing waves lapping at the shoreline next to the set when it should be the Titanic in the middle of the ocean.
But then again all films have their little quirks and errors scattered throughout. Despite those found in Titanic, the emotion that the film makes me feel is unmatched by any other movie. It is pure magic from start to finish, many times throughout the film my eyes well up with tears, or outright balling.It's one of the few movies that I would pay good money to see again in a massive full theatre.I really don't know why it's not in the IMDb top 250, when many films on the list are trash in comparison to Titanic, in my opinion.Titanic is in my Top 10 of all time, alongside Lord of the Rings, Hero, Kimi No Na Wa, Princess Mononoke, and Lonesome Dove, and others.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Ignores the fact that women in 1912 - rich and poor - were pretty much property,"The special effects are great in this film, and the love story is compelling. Even though there is no uncertainty as to how this movie plays out, it is still quite dramatic and interesting. Plus, you have to marvel at a movie that managed to win the Academy Award for best picture and was also a huge box office hit - a distinction shared with few films over the last twenty years.However, there are a few oversimplifications of the social situation of the passengers in the context of the realities of the early 20th century that bug me every time I watch this movie. First off, there is a heavy handed message of rich = bored and unhappy, poor = genuine and full of life. Given that there was absolutely no social safety net anywhere in the world in 1912, there could be nothing more brutal and grinding than being poor in that era, as if there is any such thing as ""easy poverty"" at any point in history, including today.Second, and somewhat accompanying the first sticking point, is the idea that Rose will somehow be free to be something out of a 1969 Virginia Slim's commercial if only she can lose that rich stiff she is engaged to (Billy Zane's character, Cal) and run off with kindred free-spirit Jack. This illusion not only confronts the fact of grinding poverty in early 20th century America, this flies in the face of entrenched sexism enshrined in the law during that time that wasn't even confronted as a problem until the 1960's. Who, in 1912, is going to let Rose put on a pair of jeans and ride side-saddle on Coney Island? Let her learn to pilot a plane? Allow her to pursue her career goals unless they involve teaching school, nursing, or performing (i.e. doing something that involves serving men)? And even learning those skills cost money she did not have. The fact is at that time a woman in America or anywhere else in the world was considered property. She could either be the property of a rich man (evil Cal) or a poor man. The only main character in this movie that seems to be facing facts is Rose's mother who shows genuine terror at the idea of being poor again - and she SHOULD be afraid, VERY afraid.I once had a 3rd sticking point, but it has been nullified over the last ten years. That sticking point was that Billy Zane's character could feel so superior and entitled given that his wealth and stature were accidents of birth, not the fruits of his own enterprise and imagination. I have since come to realize that some of the smuggest most entitled people on earth are those that were born into their circumstances, so I withdraw that objection.This movie did do a service by dispelling the myth that the slogan on the Titanic was ""women and children first"", when it was, in fact, ""first class women and children first"". In reality, if you were a first-class woman, you had a 97% chance of survival, and just about every first class woman that did die chose to stay behind because she did not want to leave her husband. If you were a female steerage passenger you had about a 45% chance of survival. Worse yet, third class children had a 1 in 3 chance of survival, which was the same rate of survival as the first class men. Not one of either the first or second class children died on the Titanic.Thus, I still enjoy the movie immensely, but I think that the false presentation of early 20th century social reality will always bother me a little every time I watch the film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

I had to sit through the rich girl (Kate Winslet) bored with her life and bored with her rich suitor (Billy Zane) just waiting to have fun. Then, along comes the poor, yet full of life, Jack (DiCaprio), to show her a good time and sweep her off her feet.Same Hollywood message from the 30's: rich people have money, but poor people have all the fun.Please.But like the comedian Roy Woods Jr. Said: ""Titanic was about a woman who had ""lovin'"" (my euphemism) so good that she remembered it eighty years later."" LOL!Once we got to ship sinking time I was all in. All James Cameron had to do was shave about an hour off of this three-plus hour movie and it would've been cinematic perfection!",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A real event,"In many ways Titanic is a great movie. The effects are realistic enough to let you get right into it and the performances are generally very good; especially the gorgeous Kate who convinces with, or without, her kit on. It is a story of an ill fated but grand love affair. An unhappy heiress falls for a lovely poor guy over the rich, handsome, total bastard she's engaged to and trouble inevitably follows. This epic story is played out against the backdrop of a ship sinking which adds to the emotion, poignancy, hysteria and general tearfulness of it all and therein lies my problem with this flick.Before Titanic was a film it was a ship. Many real people died. Their families still remember. (yes even a century later), This movie is not a tribute or an insult. It is a disregarding of their memory. Jack and Rose could have had their moment in any one of a thousand scenarios. Why sully this tragic event?The sinking of the Titanic is a great historical tragedy. Not only death, but needless death, plus the loss of a magnificent machine, which was a tribute to human endeavour and ingenuity. The folly of her reckless handling in dangerous waters ( That's the ship, not Kate). The stupidity of man's ""unsinkable"" challenge to nature. The struggle of the crew to save as many people (especially rich ones) as possible. What a great film that could be (they tried to make it in 1958). A story that respected every gasp for air, every self sacrifice, every bloody engineer. Why did we need Jack and Rose? Is this the price we pay for Hollywood.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

A Captivating and Heartbreaking Journey into Tragedy,"Director James Cameron's Titanic (1997) immerses viewers in the real-life tragedy of the RMS Titanic, a British ship that collided with an iceberg and met its devastating fate in the icy waters of the North Atlantic Ocean in 1912.

Could have been better.,"I have to admit that the sinking of Titanic is done extremely well.  It is terrifying to watch, and probably the closest to the real thing we will ever see.  Amazing special effects as well as realistic direction of all the extras.  You could see that every person aboard was scared.  It was very clever to show us earlier in the film how the Titanic sank, from the computerised sinking shown to old Rose, so you knew it would break in half, and how it would go down, etc.  I felt that added another sense of tension.The love story that underlined the movie was what disappointed me.  This kind of terrible scripting and love-you-till-the-end-of-time encounters is now seeping into other movies, eg: Armageddon.  Does anybody honestly think a 'proper' girl in 1912 would indulge in spitting lessons?  Or pull the finger at Hockley's 'henchman' whilst going down the elevator?  Or make love in the back of a car with someone she has only known since being aboard the Titanic?The sketching scene is the only love scene needed.  It is showing us that Rose is starting to come out of her shell and rebel, although it is a private moment.  There is an unspoken intimacy between Rose and Jack that is beautiful, and expresses their love for each other better than a hand pressing against a steam covered car window.  I'm sure that scene made many a man wish he could draw his girlfriend/fiancee/wife.On the whole, parts of the film make me twinge, that bloody song, f'rinstance.  As well as blatantly obvious computer generated shots and terrible scripting (notice it didn't get a nomination for Best Original Screenplay? - it has been years since a film that won Best Film was nominated for that award). The effects are brilliant, along with the editing and the action sequences.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Hard to be impartial about it.,"I figured that everyone who voted would give it either a 10 or a zero, so I knew that my vote of six would be next to useless.  No, it's not worth a ten, but not so bad as to give it a zero.  Anyway, after watching it (on cable, not the big screen), I had to think about my feelings about it before commenting.  The obvious things have all been said: the bad script, etc. But what I was bothered by was the cinematography.  The use of filters and such was too prevalent.  I realize this was to diffuse the light and give everything a soft, antique-y look, but it bothered me nonetheless.I watch movies and ask myself, ""What does this scene add to the overall movie?""  In many cases with this film, the answer was ""Nothing at all.""  I understand the importance of establishing shots, but I don't see the need for them to be that long.  I got up once to go to the bathroom, and when I returned, it was still the long, sweeping, panoramic establishing shot! Ok, by this time I had figured out it was a big ship.I also didn't think the whole ""outside"" story set in the present was necessary, but I guess James Cameron wanted something to differentiate this story from all the other 'true love versus class struggle' stories.I do often get emotional at sad movies (hard for a guy to admit), but I didn't cry for this one, for whatever reason.  It seemed too fake, I guess.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"To be fair, when Jack tried to get on the door, it tipped up.","A big boat hits a huge lump of ice and slowly sinks. Meanwhile, a chirpy American lad, Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), gets it on with Rose (Kate Winslet), a posh bit of British totty, much to the annoyance of the girl's fiancé, Cal (Billy Zane, putting in a wonderfully loathsome performance).James Cameron's Titanic is what I call 'factasy'. In other words, it's a factual story combined with fantastical elements to make the finished article more entertaining to the masses. A more recent example of this melding of truth and fiction is The Aeronauts, but where that film played it too fast and loose with the facts and ultimately came crashing down to earth in tatters, Cameron gets the balance of real and imagined just right, making his film both a fascinating insight into one of the most famous disasters of the 20th century, and a thoroughly charming love story.A master storyteller, Cameron successfully steers his way around any potentially disastrous obstacles that threaten to bring the film to a standstill. Even though there's a good hour and a half before any sight of an iceberg, Titanic is thoroughly engrossing from start to finish, a testament to its director's skill at weaving a good yarn, and to the talent of his impressive cast (which includes Kathy Bates as Molly Brown and David Warner as Spicer Lovejoy). Kate and Leo make for one of cinema's most iconic pair of lovers, and exude a likability and charm that carries the first half of the film. The latter part is mostly about the special effects, something that Cameron excels at, always pushing the boundaries of technology. Even after 23 years, the sinking of the mighty ship is a sight to behold, and still sends chills up the spine.It's only the film's closing moments that prevent me from giving the film full marks: why oh why did Old Rose (Gloria Stuart) chuck her priceless necklace into the sea? Give it to your granddaughter, donate it to an orphanage, put it in a museum, let Bill Paxton have it, but please don't throw it overboard! And as if that crazy act wasn't reprehensible enough, when the old dear carks it, her spirit returns to the Titanic to be reunited with Jack -- excuse me Rose, but what about your dead husband and father to your child?9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

disgustingly revolting,"I almost always refrain from posting negative reviews.  What I find ridiculous may be sublime to others.  However, this is one movie that I find so disgustingly revolting that I cannot resist adding my unwelcomed two-cents.If you're one of the three people on earth who hasn't seen the film, PLEASE take my advice and find something more constructive to do with your time.Director/writer James Cameron has reduced a TRULY horrific event into a ludicrously trite love story that makes Days of Our Lives seem like a Shakespearean tragedy by comparison.  Instead of focusing the story on actual people and events,  Cameron took the easy way out and created a cast of dull, sterotypical characters who spout inane dialogue seemingly lifted from a tv-movie-of-the-week.  Rampant historical inaccuracies, cliched directing, uninspired acting, and ridiculously cheap sentimentality all add up to one over-hyped, overrated spectacle.The only thing more nauseating than the film itself was James Cameron's ""moment of silence"" at the Oscars for the real victims of the disaster. The ""movie"" Titanic has about as much to do with the actual disaster as the Police Academy movies do with law enforcement.  This film isn't a testament to human tragedy...it's a disgusting marketing ploy aimed at bilking moviegoers out of money,  while making a mockery out of those people who experienced an event that no one should ever face.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Absolutely beautiful movie. A Cameron masterpiece.,"This story follows Jack (Leonardo Dicaprio). A poor artist who wins his ticket onboard the Titanic in a card game who meets Rose (Kate Winslet). A beautiful young woman who is raised in an uppercrust society who sees her life as too predictable and in control by her pompous buffoon fiamce Cal (Billy Zane) and craves a life of somewhat uncertainty. When Rose meets Jack an unlikely romance blossoms as the Titanic embarks on it's ill fated maiden voyage.
Cameron truly put in a lot of hard work to create an absolute masterpiece here. Yes the movie has flaws but what movie doesn't? I love how he made what could of been a dreary and gloomy drag of a movie and turned it into quite an up beat story (up until Titanic strikes the ice berg). This is in my favourites. And ignites a fascination for the tragic story that is the Titanic. So sad and outrageous how mostly third class passengers died in this disaster.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Phenomenal Film. Just Wonderful,"One of my biggest childhood memories was seeing Titanic in the theatre. I was only 7 years old when it was first released and I had no idea what a hell of a ride I was in for. My father always had a keen interest in the Titanic and its sinking, and I remember a large Atlas like book he had of the Titanic full of pictures of the wreckage, the dive teams efforts, salvage operations, etc.It was just after Christmas 1997. We went to my grandparents for a weeks holiday. During our visit, the adults decided we were all going to go and see Titanic. So we arrive at the cinema, walk in through the front entrance and there's a line-up like you can't even imagine. a huge line-up, of people, all hoping to get in and see Titanic. we stood in line for a few minutes until an usher came and yelled out ""ALL THOSE WANTING TO SEE TITANIC, TICKETS ARE SOLD OUT FOR TODAY!"", and I think that was my first inkling of ""wow this movie really is a big deal"", So dad went to the ticket booth and got us tickets for two days later, in a 3pm session that had enough tickets left for all five of us.Fast forward two days, we go in and get our seats for the 3pm session, the cinema is jam packed, i'm talking not one seat free. three incredible hours later, we walk out of the theatre, walk back through the shopping centre and get in our 4WD to drive back to nan and pops. The second I got in the car, I was just totally mesmerized the entire way home, thinking about this movie and constantly repeating wow, wow wow, inside my head. As a seven year old kid, Seeing this, all I can say this movie had me gobsmacked.Anyway, onto the movie...A 101 year old woman Rose sees a drawing of a young nude teenager on TV that was recovered from the wreckage, she quickly realizes the nude girl in the drawing is in fact her. She gets into contact with Brock Lovett (played effortlessly by Bill Paxton), who conducts frequent dive and salvage operations of the Titanic's wreckage. He is searching for a lost treasure known as the Heart of the Ocean which is an extremely rare and insanely valuable diamond. After a very disappointing failed salvage attempt, Rose and Brock come into contact and Rose is flown out to their salvage boat, Where rose ends up telling a group (including her granddaughter, Lizzy) her entire story on the Titanic from start to finish.Her story begins with Her arriving in Southampton with her mother, fiancé, Cal (played wonderfully by Billy Zane), and Mr Lovejoy (David Warner), who kind of acts like family security. We are introduced to a young and very beautiful Kate Winslet. The Titanic is still docked and the docks are crowded with avid passengers and enthusiastic spectators, all itching to see the Titanic set off on its maiden voyage. We are introduced to the handsome and mischievous Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his friend Fabrizzio in a tense poker game. They're lucky enough to win tickets on board and merely make it on board.The next portion of the film has various characters talking about the Titanic's construction, kind of as a way to feed the audience some background knowledge I guess. We're introduced to the ship's owner, builder and a whole array of other first and third class citizens. After Rose explains how depressed she was starting to feel after being caught up in the madness of being a first class citizen, and being forced to marry someone she denies her love for, we see Rose upset and about to jump off the ship committing suicide. Here, we have a lovely and eerily quiet introduction between Rose and Jack. For assisting Rose, Her fiancé cal, invites him to dinner in first class the following evening. We see the clear distinction between Third and first class. Jack has no idea how to behave like a first class citizen, and portrays that very nicely on screen to the point where it's actually quite humorous. Later on in the film, after a few more dramas, we see what I can only describe as the most Iconic and memorable on scree kiss, of any movie in history. Now we come to the part of the film we came to see. The sinking. The remainder of the film is pure epic. We see the ship slowly sinking, more water rushing through the various floors and decks, the passengers becoming progressively more panicked, The captain trapping himself in the wheel house, people turning on each other, distressed children and parents, people jumping off the ship into the freezing ocean trying to survive and it's incredible how much you do actually feel like you're there on the ship. All of it was done in studios but it literally does look like its sinking into a real ocean. And the scene where the ship splits in two, was the icing on the cake for me. After the ship has sunk, the survivors floating in the ocean become slowly more and more quiet, until there's complete silence. I still to this day find it a very eerie and disturbing part of the film. All in all, Titanic is quite simply put, just a ground breaking piece of cinema. The film makers got the Era spot on in terms of clothing and how characters look and behave, and as I understand got the look of the Titanic's interior spot on for the time period too. It really does feel like you're back in 1912, and it's always a movie I can come back to every few years and enjoy it as if it was my first time seeing it as a 7 year old. Phenomenal film. 10 out of 10. Fox.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Greatest Film ever?,I've just read some of the readers comments on this and it amazes me how this film can receive so much praise!Technologically I would say the film is very good and this is perhaps its strongest point - the fact that a film has been made which visually shows the grandeur and impressiveness of Titanic and conveys in a relatively effective way how amazing it would have been in 1912.Having said that - does anyone really care about the fate of Kate and Leo in the film ? Their acting is terrible... and I think they are both extremely talented - this may be because of the difficult circumstances surrounding the shoot or because of Mr Difficult himself - James Cameron. The plot is non-existent... how can you invent a story around the sinking of the Titanic?. And there is far too much inconsistency throughout for a Director who spent millions on real crystal chandeliers and real china 'Titanic' plates.....It was a travesty that this beat LA Confidential at the Oscars when LA Confidential has brilliant acting by all concerned and a plot that actually keeps you,6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

The only good part of this movie is the sinking of the ship. The CG in that part is really good, but really, was this that great of a movie? No. To prove this, one must only look at its theme song. Tired already? After hearing ""You'll be in my heart"" for the 1,496th time (yes, I really did count. I was really bored one month), i got really tired of it, to say the least.

One of the Greatest Movies of All Time,"Being set during the tragic sinking of the titular ship in 1912, Titanic follows the story of star crossed lovers amidst the historic calamity. Setting out to accurately capture the incident, director James Cameron poured years of research into depicting the event as closely as it played out on that fateful day. Successfully diving to the wreckage of the ship on multiple occasions, Cameron immersed himself with the task of documenting some of the smallest aspects and stories aboard the vessel. While many of the films characters are based on real attendants of the initial voyage, the leads Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) & Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) portray a completely original romantic tale throughout the event. Although the star crossed lovers are no new concept, the performance of the leads, accompanied by Cameron's writing, create one of the most timeless love story ever put to film. Each character beautifully adds to the story and each actor brilliantly embodies the time period and their individual roles in the wider tale. As a spectacle of visual effects, even over 25 years after its release, The Titanic was masterfully constructed to showcase every aspect of the absolutely horrific incident. With nearly every scene being filled with wondrous attraction, the climax resonates as the toll is taken on the emotional journey endured by viewers. Additionally, the companion piece of Celine Dion's 'My Heart Will Go On' fits flawlessly into the film and both elevate each others passionate message. James Cameron created a once in a lifetime experience with Titanic and, while capturing the realism of the event, created one of the greatest romances of this era.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Drownton Abbey,"The big iron daddy of the semi-modern era of giganto-blockbusters. Titanic was a cultural phenomenon that I was alive to witness and absorbed a fair clutter of it just through breathing. What really shocked me about watching it in 2024 was how solid it actually is as a film and how much it still stands up technically. The entire sinkening is brutally paced and the scale of the sets is extraordinary but what the whole thing hangs on, the lost love of an old woman, genuinely is deftly done and makes it quite compelling despite the runtime. Fair play to it for that and it's certainly a great deal more compelling as a story than anything in Cameron's latter blue-bloato-megabusters. That being said, the music is extremely dated, our two leads say eachother's names more than any other thing and the whole endeavour is all a bit Julian Fellowes. Despite all this, it sincerely doesn't feel like the big iron daddy without reason.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
It's TITANIC,"This movie is really good I haven't met a single person who watched this movie and hated it and also I haven't met a single person who hasn't known titanic this movie is a classic easily Leonardo's best work by far and Also Kate Winslet so if you haven't watched it and is planning to watch it cancel everything you have and watch this film, thank me later for making you have the best experience of love I swear the love between DiCaprio's character and Kate is so good that I officially called it the film for hopeless romantic because you could watch it if you have a relationship with someone but I recommend watching this when your single so that you'll cry,laugh,believe in the idea of soulmatesSummary for this review would Be wtf are you doing watch titanic now.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Great, but overrated","Titanic is NOT the best film ever. In fact, it's not even the best film of '97. But it's a great movie. The visual effects are amazing, but some of the acting is awful (Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, and especially Billy Zane). The last 1 1/2 hours of it are an emotional powerhouse, but a LOT of the dialogue is cheesy. Also, it made me angry that Leo, Kate, and Gloria Stuart (she was good, but not great) got all the acting spotlight shined on them, when it was Kathy Bates' finely tuned performance that stole every scene and showed that she can truly do everything an actress can do and more. The Billy Zane character was poorly written, poorly acted, and poorly conceived. All he was missing was a pencil-thin mustache and an evil laugh. There was a lot of talk about how bad the script was. The script was great. Sure, the dialogue sucked, but dialogue is about 10% of a screenplay. And storytelling is the other 90%. James Cameron's storytelling abilities are, today, only matched by Spielberg's.Something I really hated about it was when everyone compared it to Gone With the Wind. What is up with that?!?!?!?! Sure, there are some similarities in the plot, but Gone with the Wind is regarded by many as the best movie ever and a classic. There is no awful dialogue. There are no awful , one-dimensional characters. There are no bad performances. It's just full of good old-fashioned Hollywood storytelling at its best. It is more entertaining than Titanic, too. It is a half an hour longer, but holds your attention even better than Titanic ever could. Plus, if you take into account inflation, Gone With the Wind made twice as much as Titanic in America alone. That is a true epic. Titanic is only a pretender to the throne. But it is a great movie.8 out of 10, ***1/2 out of ****",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

How we almost abandoned ship,"Admittedly, this film did nothing for me. It isn't the best movie I've ever seen but it certainly isn't the worst either. (Although my husbane would beg to differ -- he wanted to leave after an hour of Jack and Rose prancing around the decks). I persevered feeling that I paid good money to see this epic and would see it through to the end. Unlike the assertions of previous comments, I did see the film early on in the piece and wasn't led by the hype. No matter how much they tried there wasn't much chemistry between Leonardo or Kate. (I'm still having some difficulty trying to imagine them as lovers) Needless to say, I didn't get goosebumps looking at Leo and Kate pashing or warm fuzzy feelings when they were finally separated forever.Still, I wasn't totally devoid of feeling. I was transfixed by the last hour or so of the film. By the many faces, who realised the inevitable, who accepted their fates quietly and bravely right to the tragic end.That, ladies and gentlemen,  is the real story of the Titanic.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Breathtaking,Titanic has got to be one of the best films of all times. James Cameron delivers on this retelling of a real-life tragedy about a ship wreck after a cruise ship hits a glacier. But this is more than a retelling of a real-life tragedy - it's a story of unlikely love between an upper class woman and a lower class fellow in the early part of the 1900s. It's a truly breath-taking tale with some deep tragedy inherent to the story described above. The cinematography and special effects were pretty outstanding for a film from the 90s. There's also a great film score that runs through the film including My Heart Will Go On by Celine Dion.,10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A movie that teaches you what infatuation is.,"James Cameron's Titanic is without a doubt the most accurate version of the ship, the people and the events that took place on a cold April night in 1912 on the North Atlantic. The sinking of the Titanic immortalized Jack and Rose in their love. The most beautiful love is often regret. Without long-term love, eternal love disappears. James Cameron tells us in a piece: Believe in love. But at the same time, it also suggests that without eternal love, no matter how beautiful love is, it cannot compete with life. Rose could die for love, but in the end, thanks to Jack's grace and pleading, he chooses to live for love, and the man left behind is miserable. When Rose, who is an old woman, stands by the boat and throws the heart of the sea back into the sea, I think that was its best destination.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

That should have went to L.A. Confidential or As Good As It Gets.  I do enjoy Kathy Bates in everything I see and Kate Winslet was all right.  But James Cameron's cheap theatrics with a false love story aboard the doomed ship was just a way to sell tickets, and adding ""DiCraprio"" was just icing on the cake for him.  If you like good movies, rent ""Boogie Nights"" and if you like a Titanic movie, rent ""A Night to Remember"", please.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Not Believable,"The storyline was brilliant and enjoyable with brilliant directing. The film made you care about the characters and their death. The audience knew the ship was going to sink, but leading up to the ship sinking made you care about the people and crew. This film was about building on the characters. Kate Winslet stole the film.However, Leonardo with Kate Winslet made this film unbelievable and annoying. It's hard to imagine Kate with the homeless and unattractive Leonardo. Kate definitely deserved to be recognized for her performance and Leonardo should have never been mentioned. In reality Kate's character would have never been with the unattractive and homeless Leonardo over Billy's character of a millionaire. Billy is so much more attractive and successful than Leonardo who is such a boy.Leonardo was a cry baby when he wasn't nominated for an Oscar and Kate was. Kate gave a remarkable performance and nothing stood out with Leonardo.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Timelessly and universally appealing,"A spellbinding, moving and awe inspiring motion picture.Even to be able to successfully make such a big scale movie is a feat in iteself. Particularly, the second half, showing the ship sinking is a great filmmaking achievement.Besides, the film offers an audio-visual treat by virtue of its great settings, beautiful costumes and wonderful background score.But even with all these features, the movie would have been superficial if the story wasn't poignant enough. Thankfully, the love story is one of its strongest aspects. I think there are two reasons why the love story is so touching and iconic:1.)The idea of watching the romance between two charming young lovers on the grandest, most magnificent ship in the world is fascinating.2.)On top of that, knowing that it's not too long before the ship hits the iceberg and starts to sink,thus separating the two of them forever.The ending is particularly remarkable. There are a few scenes towards the end which add great emotional depth to the ill-fated love story:The 101-year old rose dropping the diamond in the ocean, the camera moving through pictures of young rose while the old rose is asleep and finally that magical last scene- capturing the essence and spirit of the whole movie- in which the ship becomes alive and the two lovers reunite.In a nutshell, Titanic is a great motion picture which is timelessly and universally appealing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Titanic: The Greatest Masterpiece in Hollywood History,"James Cameron's Titanic is unequivocally a masterpiece, and in my opinion, the finest movie Hollywood has ever produced. From every conceivable angle, this film excels, setting an unparalleled standard in cinema.Starting with the directing, James Cameron's vision and meticulous attention to detail are evident in every frame. His ability to blend historical accuracy with compelling storytelling makes Titanic a tour de force. The narrative unfolds with a perfect balance of romance and tragedy, drawing viewers into the world of the ill-fated ship and its passengers.The cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking. Each scene is crafted with such precision that it feels like a painting come to life. The sweeping shots of the ship, the ocean, and the heartbreaking moments as the disaster unfolds are visually stunning and emotionally charged.The story and storyline are both compelling and immersive. Cameron weaves a rich tapestry of characters and events, making the viewer feel every joy, heartbreak, and loss. The romance between Jack and Rose is beautifully developed, serving as the emotional core of the film.Costumes and set design are another standout aspect. The period-accurate costumes add authenticity and grandeur to the film, while the ship itself, meticulously recreated for the movie, serves as a character in its own right. The level of detail in every aspect of the set design is awe-inspiring and enhances the film's immersive quality.The CGI and special effects are revolutionary, especially considering the film was released in 1997. The sinking of the Titanic is depicted with such realism and intensity that it remains one of the most memorable and harrowing sequences in film history.The acting performances are superb, with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet delivering career-defining roles. Their chemistry is palpable, and their portrayals of Jack and Rose bring depth and humanity to the film. Their performances add significant value, elevating the story and making their characters' journey unforgettable.The music by James Horner is fabulous, adding an emotional depth that resonates throughout the film. The hauntingly beautiful score, coupled with the iconic ""My Heart Will Go On,"" elevates the emotional impact of the story, making it even more unforgettable.Having seen over 1000 movies, Titanic is the only film I've rated 10/10 on IMDb. This speaks volumes about its impact and enduring excellence. Titanic is not just a movie; it's an experience, a timeless epic that continues to captivate and move audiences decades after its release. It deserves every Oscar win it received, a testament to its unparalleled craftsmanship and artistry.In conclusion, Titanic by James Cameron is a cinematic triumph, a film that embodies the very best of Hollywood. From its masterful direction and stunning cinematography to its compelling story, exceptional performances, and fabulous music, everything about this movie is fabulous. It stands as a testament to the power of cinema and remains, in my opinion, the greatest film ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
25th anniversary in theatre,"I was loathe to go to see this in the theater in 2023 however my friend wanted to experience it on the big screen so I obliged . I don't recall loving it when it came out, I was younger and everything was cringe back then. It is still cringe haha but in the best possibly way ! The acting and the pacing ... the unfolding of this story was so well done . It felt like a very short movie Also, having learned some of the facts about how the movie was made overhears and the attention to detail was moving. There was almost a coldness or a sterility to the experience which felt very much the setting on a brand new ship. The characters felt authentic and while of course Jack and Rose were a bit rudimentary ( for lack of a better term ) they were children of the time and their love felt wholesome and innocent against the backdrop of impending doom. The ship , the beautiful detail and it's stunning demise was truly epic ! I saw it in 3D and it didn't feel forced , it was beautiful to watch . Finally ,what I wasn't expecting was to wake up today with such vivid recollections and appreciate for how well this movie was done over time .",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Best Movie in History,By far Titanic is the best movie ever made.  James Cameron is one of the best directors.  I am very glad that they casted Kate Winslet instead of Claire Danes.

The Greatest Motion Picture of all time..??,"So you flip through the cable channels on your remote. The same old music videos are running, and the reruns get tiring. Later, you find something interesting. The evening news, Entertainment Tonight, 60 Minutes, VH1, and every other network airs clips from this, the biggest money-making film in history. TITANIC emerges as a genuine Hollywood classic for the second generation of American cinema. Never since GONE WITH THE WIND has there been powerful moviemaking with heavy genius from James Cameron. It's more than just a love story. It's an all-out disaster movie with style and vigor combined with a creative instrumental music score. It even began the craze that lured us into discoveries of the gigantic ship that never proved itself when it sunk anyway.Brilliant use of photography is what stands out the best. Imagine every single little piece of detail that wouldn't fit on this message. Replicas of the engine room and the interior designs are highly crafted to maximize the full experience of being on the Titanic while sailing on crisp, clear sea water filled with dolphins swimming with grace. During the night, one can look up the starry skies while the bright lights shine. How tragic it is for a luxury liner to capsize in half, sinking miles beneath the surface, and showing off the greatest achievement in motion picture special effects! A job extremely well done! Who will match this kind of excellence in the near future?As for the players, the pair of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are now remembered as the Clark Gable & Vivian Leigh of the next generation. Both are young, of course, and they really can ACT! Winslet should have taken home the Oscar (what blasphemy of those Academy Awards judges!). Her performance as ""Rose"" is a show stealer, as she did most of the incredible acting far better than today's young actresses. From smoking a cigarette, to possessing true beauty, to posing nude, to being a heroine, and to become a survivor, this will be a role so hard to beat in Winslet's future films. DiCaprio, on the other hand, also does magnificent as a ""street boy"" and a ""troublemaker"". The second half is the most important time to discover his best talents, including the end. Both are sensational in almost every respect.Well, you can't always expect a movie to be perfect. TITANIC's shortcomings are relatively minor. The ""modernized"" scenes don't quite prove true to a historical masterpiece made with expensive sets and decorations. Mr. Jerry Garcia Lookalike should've changed his shirt, instead of wearing the one with ""Happy Face"" shot in the head. But Gloria Stuart as the old ""Ross"" makes up for the modern touch in telling and revisiting the Titanic story through her past experiences. It's also important that we already know how the disaster had become, and that the movie tells under a fictional basis.Of localized interest: Diana Morgan was once a TV news anchor for an NBC station out here. She has recently taken on an acting career playing the role of a news reporter, notably in BABYLON 5. You will hardly get to notice her on that small TV set shown at the start of the film, but you can hear her voice.Over three hours of powerful and unprecedented movie imagery. To date, it may very well be the greatest film ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"Make another Terminator, Jim.","I will never understand the common man, and therefore will never understand the mass hysteria over this movie.  I did not care about any of the passengers James Cameron took the time to introduce us to.  In fact, we know none of the true heart-breaking tales of the R.M.S. Titanic - only the fanciful romantic tale of a spoiled brat and the only American in steerage. It is frightening to me that America embraced this movie without ever learning one bit of true history about the disaster of the Titanic.  5 will get you 10 that most of America believes there was such a jewel as the Heart of the Ocean.  We already know many fools clamored around the graves of anyone known as Jack Dawson.

The new Romeo and Juliet,"Yeah, admitted, I love this movie. Which is nothing to be ashamed of; great movie, great directing, great set, great scale, great canvas, great story. Being a rookie filmmaker myself, I have many inspirations; but among my core favorites are Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Batman (Joel Schumacher aside), and Titanic. Its the quintessential love story, and I don't think there is any particular scene, or even a single shot, that lacks superb creative insight.Given that, I can't bring myself to name a scene that wasn't powerful. True each scene was more powerful than the one before it, but it didn't lessen the awe factor. Visual effects were done as they should be, done so well that its difficult to tell where the line is - digital/real.The score is phenomenal, James Horner provides a compelling score to finally go with a compelling movie. (I mean, lets face it, his work for Jumanji and Troy was good, but the movies lacked). For me, the musical score is one of the four key components to a good movie - good script, good acting, good directing, and good musical score. Thats just my personal analysis. True Celine Dion doesn't do the love theme justice, but the love theme is just the icing on the cake. the opening montages of the ship in all its grandeur made it truly feel like reality. Magnificent, beautiful, with some Irish humor! (admit it, you loved the Irish!!!) Whats not to like about this movie? It takes everything likable about Romeo and Juliet and gives it the backdrop of one of the greatest and most tragic moments in history. That, ladies and gentlemen, makes a timeless epic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
james cameron what have you done?,"I avoided seeing this film for all of three years, due to the ludicrous amount of hype that surrounded it. I can now honestly say it was not worth the wait.  In his time, James Cameron has directed some classic films, Terminator, Aliens and The Abyss instantly spring to mind for their claustrophobia and generally tense atmosphere.  Titanic forgoes all said atmosphere and tension, relying on treacle-like sentimentality, and the unnecessary over-emphasis on special effects eclipses any innovation that his vision once had. All the money wasted on 'getting the little plates and cups manufactured by the original white star suppliers' could have been better spent getting the external deck sets to within 25% of their original size (5 1/2 foot high doors anyone?)",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
One of the Great Overrated Films,"Possibly one of the most overrated films of all time. Mind you, I am not a Titanic hater. I saw the movie, and I cried, and was moved. The sinking scene was heartbreaking. However... For all the hype, the movie isn't that high quality. A sadly cliched story, sub-par acting, historical inaccuracies, and gratuitous use of plot devices is hidden under beautiful scenery, costumes, and great special effects. It's your depressingly average story of rich girl meets poor guy, runs off, parents disapprove, evil boyfriend lurks in background. Quite possibly the best proof of the weak script is the fact that, as you watch the boat sink, and as all the characters' fates come together, it is not Jack and Rose your heart goes out to, but rather the random extras running around, falling off of things, and being trapped insidee the boat. In this, to some degree, there was success. One of the most powerful images in the movie is an old couple just lying on their bed while water floods in beneath them. Again, this movie isn't awful. It's actually pretty good. But it certainly didn't deserve the eight million Academy Awards it recieved. Costumes, yes. Special effects, sound editing, sure. It was all very well put-together. But in the categories of character and plot, where it matters most, the movie falls apart. Even the more recent Pearl Harbor, also hailed for its messy plot, is well-acted and powerful, and you at least LIKE the characters. The powerful performances hold it together. Next time you're at the video store, I'd reccomend Pearl Harbor over Titanic any time. However, Titanic still is not to be missed. It does have its good points, points which make it very much worth seeing.I rate a seven out of ten",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Better than average movie, could have been great.","Let's get the negative out of the way... DiCaprio and Winselt are akin to a Boston Terrier and a Golden Retriever.  They really needed a more masculine lead for the love story to be convincing (but then that would have cut into ticket sales for the 13-19 female demographic, right?)  Anyway, one other thing that bothered me was unevenness of the dialogue.  Winselt's dialogue seems to jump from Victorian to Gen X somewhere during the halfway point; the merging of 90's attitude with a pre-WWI setting bothered me in general (language, cursing, general attitude of some of the characters, etc.), not to mention the way Cameron manipulates the audience against Billy Zane's character, who really has done nothing wrong until he whips out a gun near the end (wouldn't *you* be mad if your fiance was carousing around with some strange guy days before your wedding?  Me too).  And what was the deal with ""old Rose"" throwing the diamond off the ship?  That made absolutely no sense to me.With all that said, the overriding message of the movie (which was summarized in Jack's speech at dinner) is a good one, the storytelling is well done for the most part, and the special effects are awesome (with the exception of one or two scenes)",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Cookie-cutter plot kills a work of art.,"""Titanic"" has all the elements of a smashing movie.  Unusually high level of detail (comparable to ""Star Wars""), a respectful tribute to Titanic's researchers, and plenty of money.  The cast is skilled, the soundtrack beautiful, and the cinematography masterful.  Now all we need is a plot. After all, because history betrays the ending, the ship's fate alone will not draw audiences.  Something needs to turn the beautiful documentary into a gripping movie.  A love story does the job nicely; it was a good idea. But then, Cameron takes over.Good Lord, what a nauseating soap opera.  The farm-boy hero, spunky maiden and evil villain trio, all but used up in ""Star Wars"", is disgustingly uncreative.  Some of the lines (""And he saved me, in every way a woman could be saved"") are so cheesy even the masterful thespians DiCaprio, Winslet and Stuart can't save their characters from being reduced to cardboard cutouts. What was Cameron thinking??  Anyone sharp enough to appreciate the detail would vomit from the recycled storyline, and anyone naïve (or stupid) enough to fall for the fairy-tale romance wouldn't acknowledge the historical faithfulness.In any case, everybody ought to see this movie at least once; it's not bad for a brainless love story and beautifully crafted.

The most undeserving of praise in the history of film,"What I think I'll probably like best about the new Star Wars film, ""Phantom Menace"", is that it will likely blow ""Titanic"" out of the water, if you'll pardon the pun, when it comes to sheer devastating box office receipts, and thereby knock it out of the number one spot. Every time I hear someone declare ""Titanic"" is the greatest film they've ever seen, I think to myself, ""You don't see a lot of movies, do you?"" What a travesty. You could make 50 good films that are a lot better than ""Titanic"", and for the same price tag.""Well, it won lots of academy awards, lots of people really loved it,"" as someone might say in its defence. Well, lots of people like the Spice Girls and billions and billions of people eat at McDonald's, but that doesn't mean it's high quality. Yes, millions of Elvis fans CAN be wrong.I'll be the first to admit, that part of the problem for me was the mega-hype over the film. I waited a month or so to see it and ultimately, it didn't live up to the expectations set upon it, which simply called more attention to the appallingly stupid love story. It's true, ""Phantom Menace"" will likely suffer a similar fate. but.James Cameron's ""Titanic"" is. a)  a cheesy action flick thinly disguised as a serious period piece. b)  a three-hour epic that has it's finest moments given away in the trailer. c)  a sappy love story beyond belief or entertainment. d)  something left better to documentarians, which I would've enjoyed much more. e)  a film with arrogance that lives up to the level demonstrated with the real ship. f)  a  robbery of 3 hours that I will never get back, therefore the greatest motivation for a time machine I can think of. When I meet someone who hasn't seen it yet, I say, ""I wish I could trade places with you."" g)  a slap in the face to any genuine victim of hypothermia. How long are we supposed to believe that people can be immersed in freezing cold water and still form intelligible sentences? h)  thankfully a film that wasn't recognized for any acting achievements at the Oscars. i)  a technological achievement in filmmaking, and little else.The only reason I post this as a anonymous comment is I do NOT welcome the rebuttal of 10,000 thirteen year old Leonardo DiCaprio fans who'll no doubt come to his defense, and I am not really interested in hearing a defense of Titanic's story, acting or length.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Very few movies talk about what it was like for an immigrant and what it was like in the 1900s, like you don't really learn about it in school. It's really amazing. I love British people and I think this movie is so great because very few movies talk about other countries, like how the lead characters are British. That's what I realised what I wanna see as an American, movies about other countries! Like they were doing in one of the scenes where it was the Irish culture and the dancing and I was like ""Oh my god! James Cameron's a genius!"" I mean that was so great you know. I also thought it was kind of touching. They didn't just talk about what it was like for the rich people but they talked about what it was like for the people coming into America, and no movies have done that as I've seen, I was like that's so amazing, I thought that was really great they did that, they touched that. The stories about real stories, like real people, the stories about the immigrants it was so great.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
7.8?????,IMDB needs to take executive action with this rating. 7.8 is criminal. This is the definition of a masterpiece. James Horner steals the show again with the only score more haunting than Braveheart's.,10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Good detail, tragic yet slightly cheasy","Titanic is a fairly good movie, but I personally think the historical part of the movie seemed to be more touching and overall better then the love story between Jack and Rose. Their relationship seemed to have all of the aspects that every Hollywood romantic-fantasy has: the two young lovers are breaking the social code to be seeing each other, they're both young enough to pass as teenagers..(which, in this film, I think they are) , there is a steamy scene, and it has a touch of tragedy. Well, it's all very predictable but James Cameron did a wonderful job with the story of the ship Titanic. I found that part more touching and realistic than the love story. You really can see the passenger's terror and panic during the sinking sequence. Its all very saddening to watch because, as you watch it, you know that it actually happened many years ago. The amount of detail put into it was incredible, from the ""woman and children first, first class first"" to the musicians staying aboard to play, the fireworks... all very nice to watch.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Special effects and not much else.,"I guess I'm in the minority but I don't see what all the fuss is about. The special effects were spectacular but the death of 1500 people seemed incidental behind DiCaprio and Winslett's rather corny romance. Aristocrat girl, betrothed to the villain you love to hate, falls for the street-wise tramp (who looks years her junior.)At least the producers got their facts straight and depicted the sinking accurately, but I can't see this film ageing gracefully when in years to come the 90's special effects lose their impact and our kids mock the mid-90's hairstyle DiCaprio sports in this film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

A Spectacular and Moving Epic of Love and Survival,"Titanic is a 1997 film directed by James Cameron, who also wrote the screenplay and co-produced the film. The film is based on the historical event of the sinking of the RMS Titanic, the largest and most luxurious passenger ship of its time, which collided with an iceberg on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York in 1912. The film focuses on the fictional romance between two passengers from different social classes: Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), a poor artist who won a ticket in a poker game, and Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet), a wealthy aristocrat who is engaged to a ruthless tycoon, Cal Hockley (Billy Zane).The film depicts the fateful journey of the Titanic, from its departure to its tragic demise, and the experiences of the passengers and crew on board. The film also portrays the social and historical context of the early 20th century, such as the class divisions, the women's suffrage movement, and the technological innovations. The film is a stunning visual feast, with impressive sets, costumes, and special effects that recreate the Titanic and its surroundings with remarkable realism and detail. The film also features a memorable musical score by James Horner, and the iconic theme song ""My Heart Will Go On"" by Celine Dion, which won an Oscar for Best Original Song.The film is not only a technical marvel, but also a powerful and emotional drama, that explores the themes of love, courage, sacrifice, and survival. The film draws the audience into the lives and fates of the characters, and makes them care about their hopes and dreams, their joys and sorrows, their choices and actions. The film also raises ethical and moral questions, such as the responsibility of the ship's owners and officers, the value of human life, and the meaning of death. The film is a tribute to the Titanic and its passengers, and a reminder of the fragility and preciousness of life.Titanic is a film that has captivated and moved millions of viewers around the world, and has become one of the most successful and acclaimed films of all time. It won 11 Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director, and is currently the third-highest-grossing film of all time, behind Avatar and Avengers: Endgame. It is a film that deserves to be seen and experienced, and that will stay with you long after the credits roll. It is a film that is truly titanic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The worst movie ever made,"Certainly the worst movie ever made. Most expensive!!! What a waste. I don't think it is worth the paper the script was typed out on.The story line, dialogue and cinematography was atrocious. I probably would have enjoyed the movie more if the volume was put to 0.The final scenes were extremely unreal to say the least and probably the most funniest scene ever made.I definetely give this on a 0/10.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Finally.....,"I've been reading a few comments and I have finally found that I am not the only one who found this an overstretched boring waste of 2 hours (an hour out of 3 was good). The dialogue was boring and corny. The chemistry between the Leo and Kate was non-existent, they did not even remotely look suited to each other (he was far too small for her). Dicaprio didn't act that well in it,Winslet was pretty good.The effects though were excellent, some of the best effects I've seen, the way half the boat breaks in half and falls is amazing, also when the propellors the water they look amazing.But overall I came away dissapointed, my little sister (12 yrs) looked bored during the film but due to the hype she said she loved it and saw it another 3 times.

"Shocking, emotional, and simply the best","Not many movies make me emotional, not many movies make me ponder life, and almost no movies make me cry. But I was a nervous wreck, I was shaking, I felt so many emotions. The movies that tell stories of true events are always good. But something about Titanic made it so special. I knew what was going to happen, but I still couldn't handle it. It kills me to think what everyone experienced. This movie certainly detailed what happened that day. I know I've said it before, but this is the greatest movie of all time. James Cameron is an incredible director, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet were excellent, and the graphics were amazing. People who say this movie isn't good have never experienced emotion in their lives.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
It was NOT the greatest film of all time(not even best of Cameron),"I know there is a million respones already written, but I just can't help letting some readers know that this is not by all means a great film. There was one moment that caught my breath.  I don't believe J Cameron intended this scene to be though.  It was when Jack said he was from Chippewa Falls (WI). Since I am from WI, this line made me enjoy the movie for a few seconds. If that was the only scene I liked, well this film will be and is in big trouble.Ok there are a few things that weren't bad.  1. Kathy Bates (should have been nominated for the statue) 2. a likeable theme in music.  3. good opening scene(it was pretty spectacular)Now, the rest I have to say are for the Titanic freaks.1.  This script was beyond pathetic.  Cameron trys to be touchy by having two completely different people fall in love.  True, they could have been made for each other, but the way Cameron incorporated all the scenes were hideous. The script of the present time is decent, but the story telling part is horrible.  I couldn't get rid of the feeling of numbness in my butt. 2.  Acting was for the most part not good (except Bates).  Winslet is the worst.  She could not get me to feel for her.  Her jumping scene is simply boring.  Leo- was better, but still did make me feel like he is in love with her.  And please, Leo can't lift her when she fell over. Maybe that's why we never saw them together in the scene. 3.  The graphics- ok it was pretty neat how they sank the ship.  But the scenes never made me feel like I was on that ship.  The boat was very fake. Plus the water looked like a giant swimming pool.  And the sky looks like something I drew in kindergarten.  Just look back at other movies. Jurassic Park had much better graphics. 4.  Music-  I am a music major, and James Horner is not a composer I admire. He developed a fairly interesting theme.  But he never went anywhere with it.  All the music seemed to be in the same mood. Finally, story.....it was simply boring.  No one will ever beat Spielberg or Lucas in telling a story.Cameron should have stuck to his T2 or T3.  Stay away from other genres. All the films nominated in 97 were better than Titanic.  I thought Amistad should have won it, but that's my taste.  But to see people saying Titanic was a great movie......I JUST WANT TO PUKE",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Best romantic movie ever,This movie is the best romantic movie ever I have watched. I have watched 3 times. First part in the movie will show you the rich and poor part of the people's.

In the other hand the actress's mother arranged her marriage with some rich guy who is very rude. When both the main character's meet each other . They slowly fall in love with each other.

"Lack of historical accuracy, etc.","After watching Titanic ONCE, many things went through my mind.  People see this as a masterpiece while I see this movie as another above-average movie. I felt like going to the restroom after staying in my seat for more than three and a half hours (counting trailers). One glaring aspect I personally do not like is Cameron's portrayal of the third class passengers being locked in their area.  This did not really happen in the true story of the Titanic.  Many famous people died on the ship and Cameron does not refer to this.  Instead, he plays on people's emotions to make them feel sorry for the third class passengers' misfortunes. Another setback I saw in the movie was DiCaprio's less than average acting performance.  He was not nominated for Best Actor for a reason and Kate Winslet was a poor match to put with him.  She looked a lot older than DiCaprio and her better acting ability made DiCaprio's acting look even more disparaging. Even with the movie hoopla, the teenage girl infatuations of DiCaprio, and the great box-office records it broke, Titanic is not one of the best movies of all time, but good enough for a night with a loved one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
You probably like Scream too,"The Greatest film of all time? HMMM.I vowed to never watch the film, but I did. What a waste of time and 2 video cassettes. I did give the film a chance. I am a James Cameron fan, I own all of his other films on cassette. What can I say. The film was boring, the acting was horrible. DiCaprio was laughingly bad, and he actually thought he deserved an Oscar nod. Billy Zane played the best character in the film, honestly. His character was the most entertaining character.Too bad so many people were blinded by DiCaprio's looks and did see the bad acting flowing from him. The special effects were poor. C'mon, long black bars representing the night sky. Mushy looking computer generated faces put over stunt peoples faces to make them look like DiCaprio and Winslet. There is no way that DiCaprio could swim up to the surface of the water after being pulled in by such a huge undertow. The special effects guys forgot to add frozen breath in many of the sequences that take place in the frigid water. Also during that scene you can here soundstage echos. DiCaprio sure spent a lot of time talking about places he had been to, which is fine, considering they did not exsist back then. Oh yea, It was sure nice of DiCaprio to turn his back on his apparent life long best bud for Winslet. What a nice guy. Look closely as Leo enters, the dining hall, you can see the reflection of a big camera and some crew guys carrying it. And if you adjust ticket prices for inflation, Titanic is not even close to being the highest-grossing film of all time. Gone With The Wind, E.T., and even The Star Wars Trilogy would have earned more. Too many Titanic fans brag about that. Kate Winslet did not need to be naked in that film. Also, her older version in the 90's could not have remembered all those facts about the ship. Bill Paxton was wasted in this film. This is not even close to being the greatest film of all time, It is not even a good movie.Check out Reservoir Dogs, The Star Wars Trilogy, Predator, even This Boys Life (A good DiCaprio film).",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Movie which touched the core of my heart !!!!!!!,"The movie opens as researchers try to find out diamonds inside the wreck of the real titanic, which gives us the first full look of the wreck of the unsinkable ship which was a bit emotional. Bill Paxton finds 85 years old diary which hold the drawing of the naked women & then later on it's been telecast on TV. The movie goes into flashback & here comes the glimpse of the beautiful ship titanic. The bunch of characters appear in the movie at the port of Belfast, which also includes the male leading start Leonardo winning the ticket of titanic on the lucky hand of poker. The movie literally gives you the feeling of viewer being inside of the ship & according to the facts everything in the movie is been re-designed from the furniture to the decks, lamps, the door way, life boats, & along with the engine room.The real movie beings after Rose decides to suicide jumping from the rear end of the ship & Jack take her mind off the track & saves her. As the movie continues Jack & Rose starts to meet up regularly at the different parts of the ship, while on the other hand Rose mother & her fiancé Cal doesn't like Rose spending time with lower class standard jack, but still young hearts were attracted to each other. The best scene in the movie according to me is the flying scene of Jack & Rose, which makes rose realize that she is in love with Jack too.The movie takes sudden turns when on the same night titanic hits the iceberg, which in short left my eyes wide open, as it has been directed & executed very well, & then the final chapter of the maiden voyage beings the sinking of the unsinkable titanic. The final hour of the movie filled with reality & the disaster which people till now hasn't forgotten. People struggling to survive & the real history how traveler's were saved into the life boats are the key scenes of the movie. Some true scenes like the Creator of titanic Thomas Andrews died while standing near the dining clock & was last seen, the steamer falling on the jacks brother, third class traveler's were treated during the sinking scenes. The breaking apart of ship are the most shattering scenes in the movie.There is no doubt even today in 2012 still I wonder what James Cameron has achieved in the special effects put into this movie, the year 1997 the worked on their best special effects effort to keep this movie alive even for the upcoming generation to watch on. The soul of the movie is the background score of this motion picture which is composed by James Horner every piece of music is been composed specially to suit the scenes of this movie itself, from the opening sequence to de-porting of titanic to Rose theme & the sinking sequence. James Cameron specially recorded the score of the movie with real orchestra the team of James Horner. In one the interviews of the making of Avatar one of the viewer asked him "" what if you get a chance to direct Titanic again, what would be your experience in making it "" ?? and he answer if I would have been given a change to direct titanic again, I will finish titanic within a month very easily cause of hugely availability of special effects team, cause for titanic I had to wait for some shot for days. For example the shot of Rose & Jack on the front end of the ship kissing each other, he had to wait for days to get proper sunset in the camera as special effects that time weren't that advanced like how they are today. In one word you're a legend Cameron. The wreck shot of ship were taken in the year 1995 2 years before the releasing the movie into theaters. Till now whenever I watch this movie I still feel I'm watching it for the first time & somewhere there are tears in my eyes specially in the scene where rose steps into the life boats & Jacks watches her going away, oh geez that particular scene gets tears in my eyes every time. I am now waiting for the special edition of this movie to be released in 3d blu-ray.True facts about TITANIC Titanic was constructed to be unsinkable ship of that time, but the creator of the ship Thomas made 3 biggest mistakes in constructing the ship. The propeller of the ship were taken directly from the design of the 18's century cruise liner, the water tight compartments had one the major flaws which over flowed the water from the upper decks, the propellers turning radius was not designed to turn ship quickly as the ship size was way bigger than the propellers could bear it during the full stern.On the night of sinking titanic received 5 iceberg warning, but still they ignored the warning & continue sailing. The final decision by the Mr Murdoch to reverse the engines & turning the ship to evade iceberg. The decision not to carry enough life boats cause it ruins the overall look of the top deck & it was initially decided to carry just 8 life boats, but later on more 12 boats were added. The distress call from titanic was actually received by the local streamer waiting for the morning to sail again couldn't reach for help as the streamer couldn't see the titanic as the sky was full of twinkling stars which interrupted the them to see through binoculars.The crew lost their binoculars on the night ship hitted the iceberg.My rating – 10/10 !!!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Marvellous Movie - Excellent 3D Conversion,"I just went into the movie theatre to see my all time favourite movie, Titanic by James Cameron, in all its brilliance.It's just like those 15 years have never happened. It's so utterly sweeping to watch this huge vessel rising up in the screen. Cameron outstandingly managed to shoot his sequences comparing sizes against each other which - by their contrast - brings so much emotion to something we only perceive in real life: size.After watching the movie, I can't believe this is a 2D to 3D conversion. This is not just a diorama kind of 3D conversion; watching the movie it's hard to believe it was not shot in 3D originally. Even in real life action scenes Cameron stems the task of creating realistic 3D perspective throughout the movie. It must have been hell to mesh all the fringes in each and every of the frames. Well, as I learned now, it took 60 weeks and 18 Million dollars to work on this. That gamble payed off very well.Not to mention all the emotion that comes with the story. Cameron is a wizard of timing. One moment the audience is just deeply moved by romance, when it gets torn out right the next moment by fear, anger or laugh.This is a very emotional film. There are so many different fates one can as easily think his/her way into. In 1997 I have been crying about what I saw in a movie - I was baffled, because this happened for the first time in my life... Now in 2012 I was crying, laughing, fearing so much all the way again, together with my girl friend.We personally feel so much like Rose and Jack. There are so many details in the movie that match our situation, up to tiny things like dancing barefoot or the butterfly as a symbol for freedom at heart and escape from family's restrictions.To all those who don't like the movie, here's my advice: NEVER watch this film on TV! You can only appreciate this precious work of art in a movie theatre. - I never saw this movie on TV and I never will. But when it'll come back to the theatre's in a couple of years, I'll be right back to watch it there.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
How much crap will we put up with?,"How can we live in a world where a piece of *%^@ film like Titanic can even be considered for an Academy Award?  Now I understand that I must give some credit to Mr. Cameron for spending WAY too much on minor details (such as the ships's engine) which could have easily been avoided.  This is the obvious case of a man who needs to spend as much money as possible for publicity? Anyone remember the last time that stunt was pulled?  It was called ""Waterworld"" - and was equally as bad and chessy.  The only difference was that ""Waterworld"" did not take place around a real event - and that is the ONLY reason Titanic won Best Picture, oh and how I can forget the ludicrous special effects!!!  In my humble opionion no film that isn't at least nominated for Best Screenplay should be able to take home the Best Picture award.  Mr. Cameron must have written his script after an inspiration of something he saw floating in a toilet.  I'm sorry to say this Mr. Oscar, but you've lost my respect.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Maybe...if only the technical stuff counts.,"For a long time, I hated this movie.  The drawn out scenes, the ridiculous plot line, the horrible script, the melodramatic acting, and to top it all off, an annoying ballad to accompany this poor excuse for a feature film. Nevertheless, this movie enthralled some moviegoers to sit through it four of five times.  Could I have been that wrong about the biggest box office hit in history?The answer is no.  Although I have seen the movie for a second time and now more clearly realize how remarkable the visual effects truly are, I can't let go of everything else.Kate Winslet actually received an Oscar nomination for her flat, uninteresting portrayal of Rose and people were really upset that she lost? I find this hard to believe considering that Winslet came off in this film like she ordered her SAG card off of the Home Shopping Network.  Also, her pairing with DiCaprio was as odd as Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggie, only without the on-screen chemistry of the famous puppets.The two interesting characters in this whole shipwreck,  didn't even receive the recognition they deserved in my opinion.  Billy Zane and Kathy Bates were the only people keeping me awake and they were ignored while Gloria Stuart received a nomination for playing a role my grandmother could have better demonstrated.Best Picture?  I think not.  However, Titanic does deserve every award it has received for visual effects and art direction.  I'm also willing to agree with the Academy in choosing James Cameron as Best Director. Nonetheless, this movie does not have the ingredients to be considered the Best Picture of 1997 let alone of all time.  Perhaps if I watch it a third time?  I doubt it.  6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Maytime On The High Seas,"Who says that old fashioned romantic films don't sell. They certainly do if they're done right as the story in Titanic certainly is.This blockbuster version of the most famous shipwreck in history is a homage to Maytime. In fact in casting Gloria Stuart as old Rose through whose eyes we see the disaster unfold, Director James Cameron went back to a contemporary of Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy.The film begins with the discovery of the wreck of the Titanic in the middle Eighties which did cause great excitement at the time. Searching the wreck divers come upon a safe and a nude portrait of a woman wearing a necklace with a diamond thought to be lost and the portrait is dated April 14, 1912. The woman is still alive and its Gloria Stuart who tells her tale the way an aged Jeanette MacDonald did in Maytime.Winning a card game that got him a third class passage aboard the maiden voyage of Titanic, itinerant artist Leonardo DiCaprio gets on board the vessel. He meets and woos a younger version of Gloria Stuart who is played by Kate Winslet. Unfortunately she's about to enter a loveless marriage for money urged on by her mother, Frances Fisher, who wants her declining years not be spent in the poorhouse.Her prospective fiancé is Billy Zane a rather arrogant young robber baron heir of his time who has a factotum/bodyguard in David Warner who has one of the best roles in the film. Still Leo and Kate get a few stolen hours of romance before the disaster strikes.One thing that James Cameron did is that he never allowed the spectacle of the disaster nor even the issues of wealth and class that were omnipresent in the Titanic story to overwhelm his romantic leads. In fact they are an integral part of the story as young Leo reaches for what was unobtainable.Leonardo DiCaprio remarked that his part of Jack was the least complex role he ever did. The part is a romantic lead, the guy has no secrets or hidden issues, he's just a young man in love. Maybe that was the reason he was not nominated for Best Actor in the face of all those nominations Titanic did get. It won for Best Picture and Best Director and a flock of Oscars in the technical area. Kate Winslet and Gloria Stuart were nominated and lost for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress respectively.Titanic is a story that's been filmed since the silent days almost in the wake of the disaster itself. The Germans made a propaganda film of it in 1943 which Nazi inspired though it was, did make a few points against the British upper classes and that the first class got saved and those in steerage mostly drowned. There was a fine version in 1953 with Clifton Webb and Barbara Stanwyck as an older married couple with problems on the doomed ship. And the British did the classic, A Night to Remember which is a documentary like recreation from the ship's officers point of view.Still they'll have to go some beat this one. Titanic is a film for lovers of all ages and run Maytime back to back with Titanic if you can get DVDs and/or VHSs of both films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Surprise Twist Ending That You'll Never See Coming,"""Titanic"", a movie based on an obscure footnote of maritime history, is a mixed bag of a movie.  On the one hand there's the amazing visuals, the intense attention to historical detail, commendable performances and to top it all off, a nude scene with Kate Winslet.  On the other hand this movie has a sub-par script and a cliche of a plot, coupled with stereotypical, one-dimensional characters and a three-hour running time.  Even when you factor in the surprise ending (hint: it involves an iceberg) this film is far from ""the greatest ever""; in fact, I wouldn't put it in my top thirty.

Later in the film, there is a fade between the faces of young & old Rose and this time old Rose's have magically changed to match Kate Winslet's eyes-After Rose has helped Jack to get loose from where he is handcuffed, as he is jumping over a bench one minute he has the handcuffs on, the next shot they're gone. Then they're back. -After Rose breaks Jack's handcuffs below decks and both race down the hallways outrunning the rising water. Rose is clearly wearing white sneakers yet she is seen 30 seconds later wearing period shoes when Jack retrieves the gate key that the crewman dropped beneath the rising water.There are too many of them, so I'l stop here!

Best James Cameron movie in my personal opinion.,"Hands down one of the best romance films ever made, Titanic is an epic, action-packed historical love story that delivers in every single way.

Power of Love,"Extraordinary love story and very touching heart. it's one of the best films I've ever watched. I don't know how to explain my feelings. oh god, this film makes me shed tears. even now when I watch this film again, it can't be felt not to shed tears. it is rare for me to feel this kind of feeling that is even difficult to express. I have never been bored to watch it repeatedly and even the power of the film hasn't diminished in the slightest, even though this movie has been released for quite a long time. maybe there are only a few films in this world that make the audience take part in feeling the story in this film.When I first watched this movie, I cried and didn't know what to say, I thought it was an amazing film with a storyline that couldn't be guessed and there were not only sad parts but also parts that could make laughter so that this film not flat and not boring. Until now it was the best film in my life, no single film could match it.
This film for me there are many grooves so we have to really pay attention from the beginning so that no part is missed so we will feel the intention to convey this film. I think this film has been very perfectly made with technological sophistication which at that time was very extraordinary. I think this character by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet is extraordinary, they are like being able to be interconnected and truly like love stories in the real world. young couples who face complicated love stories in the middle of a different background, full of struggles and challenges that must be faced but with the power of love all can be passed.I think this will be the best film of all time that will never be forgotten.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

One of the Best movies of all time,I saw this movie in the theatre's back in 1997 and remembered it as a brilliant movie. The cinematic experience was one of the best of my life even though the story is tragic and very sad. I recently watched this film with my 13 year old daughter. The magic is still there. This is still one of the best movies of all time and perhaps the greatest love story of all time. The new blue ray release is fantastic and James Horner's score is still timeless. Great job James Cameron...for producing a once in a lifetime film. Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet were fantastic in this film and both deserved best actor/actress awards.Don't be afraid to bring this one back out people... its still a beautiful epic that will stand the test of time.,10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"A commercial success, dishonor to cinema","Titanic is a comercial movie, who couldn't be worst in a film making.

Rarely has a three hour film seemed so short. It canters.,"The cinema viewer may well wonder whether there can be any real suspense when it is clear from the beginning of the film that the central character, Rose (Kate Winslet), will survive the disaster that befalls the Titanic. But suspense there is, not least because we don't know whether her lover will make it. There is also action, social (class) comment, drama, historical notes - not least several comments on the cause of the initial impact and why it was so disastrous - and good old fashioned romance.Rarely has a three hour film seemed so short. It canters. The romance at the centre of the plot develops quickly and my attention was held not only by developments in this story but the events that, taken together, spelt disaster for the 'unsinkable' ship, and then the aftermath of the ship's collision with that famous iceberg.Kate Winslet was simply gorgeous and put in a fine performance, as did Leonardo di Caprio as Jack Dawson. The make-up of the older Rose (Gloria Stuart) was one of the less convincing aspects of the movie, but it seems churlish to draw attention to such a detail; in any case, it's to be expected that an 87 year old will need a fair amount of facial recontouring and war-paint to play a woman of 101.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Titanically overrated,"Teenage girls spent an entire summer watching this movie; people flocked to it in unprecedented numbers; the Academy of Motion Pictures completely lost its head and awarded it Best Picture. All for a film that was little more than a poorly-written Harlequin Romance set on the greatest ship to never finish one voyage.This film could have been improved in so many ways:1) Punt the insipid fictional love story and focus on the real-life characters. The supporting cast playing the actual people on board the Titanic was, on the whole, a much better group of actors than the ones in the fictional love story.2) Have somebody (anybody!) else play the role of Jack. Matt Damon would have been good, Joaquin Phoenix would have been better, but DiCaprio was a huge mistake.3) If DiCaprio is really a must, have him and Billy Zane switch roles. Zane is much better suited to the romantic lead role, and DiCaprio would have been perfect as an unlikeable, self-absorbed fop.4) The Captain should have been portrayed more as he was in real life, not as the confused, incompetent geezer the movie makes him out to be. Witness reports say that Captain Smith acted heroically and with honor; it is a disservice to his memory to portray him as this film does.After all this, I must admit that I did kind of like this movie. I just don't understand all the fuss over it, and I REALLY don't understand why it won the Best Picture Oscar. This is a good film, but it is far from being a great film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
what was the point of this,"I must admit, as a movie buff, that this was the worst piece of sap-o-rama ever the ""grace"" the screen. I mean, What was the point?  It was about two little spoiled kids running around on some stupid boat saying stuff like ""I'll never let go"". Come on!!  The romantic side of it was so contrived it felt like I was being choked as I watched it.  None of the characters were even half-way decent, and all the actors were just a waste (Leo Dicaprio is a loser) the boat was the main character, and the iceberg was the supporting actor/bad guy.  Towards the end of the movie, I was hoping the boat would just sink already just to put me out of my misery.  When Kate Winslet was threatening to throw herself overboard, I was on the edge of my seat yelling ""Jump! Do it, Jump!""  James Cameron uses the death of a thousand innocent people in an attempt to illicit some emotion out of the audience, since the characters of the movie can't do it.  The only redeeming quality of the whole film was Kathy Bates, but even she couldn't save this boat from sinking.  Let's face it, the only reason there is to watch this movie is if you got a couple of hours to kill and your dentist can't give you a root canal just right now, but you want to prepare yourself for the pain.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
despite the risk of death i wanna go back 2 titanic!,"I'm a sucker 4 romance, history and Leonardo DiCaprio, so this movie captivated me, it felt like u were there, on the doomed ship, the beauty and elegance of the 1st class captivated me while the fun and free steerage party made me want 2 dance. the romance was so carefully done and i loved it, the drawing was sensual and romantic-it was done so every single girl was left wishing their boyfriends were amazing artists as well. my only complaint was ""my heart will go on"" it was a cute song but Celine Dion-while writing it should not have sung it-sorry but she cant sing and with that one song has turned all my guy-friends from watching the movie (which sux because its my fave movie and now wen we watch movies at each others houses we cant watch titanic as they r now agsinst the soundtrack) when the ship is sinking its amazing the way you feel for the people falling off (except for the lady who slid down it and flashed everyone and the guy who fell off the end and fell on the propellers-those were funny and provided comic relief) but the way you just felt sad for the lady with the baby asking the captain for help, murdoch feeling helpless and shooting himself, fabritzio getting killed by the funnels and tommy Ryan getting shot. Kate Winslet gives an unforgettably performance and i suggest she dyes her hair that colour again because its so gorgeous. i loved what she wore and i bet every girl wishes they had her wardrobe (before the sinking obviously). Leonardo DiCaprio was impeccable as the (sexy) penniless artist who teaches rose how to love and gives her the courage to ""never let go"" this is a bawl your eyes out movie and is not to be missed",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Filmmaking on the Grandest Scale,"James Cameron does not do small films, even his breakout film The Terminator was hitting way above its budget. This is down to Cameron himself and his extreme work ethic to get the money right up there on the screen. This film often gets poor reviews from people, mainly due to its immense commercial success. However this success is truly deserving. There is no other film maker out there who can produce a film on this kind of scale and still pull it off. I was lucky enough to see it at the cinema in 1997. Straight off to even consider diving to the Titanic wreck itself to film it for the movie would be considered insane, Cameron did it 12 times. The film was pitched as Romeo and Juliet on Titanic and Cameron immediately got funded. The film ran massively over budget and there was huge concern at the time that the whole project would implode. However Cameron knew he was onto something special, creating a stunning replica of the Titanic itself, along with exact decor and furniture, props, clothing, even tableware. Cameron cast Romeo himself from the 1996 film Romeo and Juliet, Leonardo Di Caprio. This was a masterstroke as Di Caprio was gaining unrivalled stardom after the 1996 film. Kate Winslet is fantastic as Rose, as a young actress to have that level of scale all resting on your performance to make it all come to life, she pulled it off amazingly and often does not get the credit she deserves. The real star of the show though is the ship itself and its master film director James Cameron. When the ship starts sinking and Cameron moves into his action mode, there is no-one better in the world at pacing action them Cameron, he is a master of suspense at the exact right moments. He is an exceptional story teller and fully deserved all the accolades he has acquired.I highly recommend Titanic and encourage you to watch it on the largest screen possible, films like this do not come along often. The 3d Blu ray is also exceptional and shows what can be done when a 2d film is converted in the right hands into 3d.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Named Titanic, but turns out to be an oversized Love Boat.","A fictional romantic story rapping itself up in a true tragedy.Cameron goes to all the work on the detail of the set and overlooks the time period. People in Steerage did not have the run of the ship.  They were confined to the aft (back) part of the ship.  They were not allowed in the middle or at the bow of the ship.  Which completely destroys DiCaprio's little ""I'm king of the world"".The movie should be commended on set design, but not for details of facts. If one is going to do a period piece, then one should research the period.The true story of the Titanic would have been a better movie.  It could have been a moving about humanity's arrogance and how nature put humanity in its place.  It would have also shown how this tragedy should have never happened.  They should have had enough lifeboats and had a round the clock radio operator.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

The special effects of Star Wars Episode I or Starship Troopers are much better.I think the reason why I find this movie boring is not that it is badly done or the average quality of the special effects.

Overrated,"Many of my friends have bought Titanic now that it is available on videocassette, yet I have only seen it once.  I believe that this movie is horribly overrated.  I am not saying that I did not enjoy the movie, because I did.  It was a very interesting account of the lives of two central people aboard the Titanic, one of the worst disasters in history.  The real excitement hit when the boat hit the iceberg.  The movie kept my attention from then on out.  Many people say that this movie is the best movie ever created.  I beg to differ.  In my opinion, the best movie ever made is Gone With the Wind.  You just can't compare to such an epic.  Titanic doesn't even come close.  When you really boil the movie down, it merely is a dressed up romance with an action/adventure tagged onto it.  It is a very exciting movie, but I prefer to see it only once, and it does not compare to the classic old movies which have stood the test of time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
An overrated piece of dross...,"I'm one of the cynics, and am quite proud of it, thanks. I cannot fathom why this film received any Oscars apart from anything for special effects (in that department, it excels). Yes, the actual cracking apart and sinking of the legendary ocean liner was extremely well done. But as for the rest, just one word: disappointment.First, there's Leo--not a terrible actor, but pretty limited here. And Kate? About the same goes for her. Then, there is the story. It would have been more interesting if it had focused on the lives of others who were actually on the ship--including the crew. It's also painfully over-long, AND it has a Celine Dion song to boot. How much more wrong can it possibly get?An overrated piece of dross indeed.",3.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Masterpiece, of course","Decades later, this remains a truly timeless and captivating masterpiece, with effects that are still impressive for the most part, but above all, with a story that is as compelling as it is tragic. It is one of the few love stories that is well-written, not neglecting basic elements like pacing, argumentation, the interweaving of components, and character dimensionality. The pacing is dynamic, with a slow start that gradually increases in intensity.Additionally, this is complemented by the intensity of the acting, the music, the cinematography, and even the chaos. This production orchestrated - with great synergy - the best of each of its departments, making them iconic in many ways. However, this has also been, to some extent, counterproductive, as many scenes have often been caricatured to the point where the essence of the original has been lost - which, undoubtedly, is far superior.At least, that's what I felt after watching the movie for the second time, 20 years after that first time I saw it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Decent Drama with brilliant Sets,"Titanic is a fair work from director James Cameron. Sometimes being called on the carpet for it's naive plot and dialogue, this movie had the rare merit of reuniting the public and the critics in an unanimous way: James Cameron's Titanic is an effective work to be remembered. This does not happen so often. For several weeks, this movie had the privilege to score brilliantly on the top charts, as well as conquering major movie awards around the world. Is it fair? Was it overrated? That does not matter, if we accept it for what it stands. It worked perfectly. The artwork is ostentatious and the acting if not perfect is adequate and balanced with the strength of the script written by Cameron himself. Leonardo DiCaprio gives the necessary honesty to the role, while Kate Winslet grants the wit, elegance and grace that a romantic and troubled heroin should have. Miss Winslet was without any doubt the finest actress for the role. Apart from the supremacy of the visual effects, which are the main core of this movie for most of its viewers, Titanic dazzles for the truth and sensibility present in every single detail in every scene. More than a parade of mere flash-backs from an old lady who once was ""a dish"", this movie is a fine drama made with a solid sense of loyalty and respect for the viewer. You know what happens before you pay for your ticket. You know it is a love story set on a transatlatic and you know people will die. What matters, most of all, is the possibility Cameron gives you to imagine what might have been if you had the chance to find true love under the most ungrateful circumstances. 8 out of 10 for Cameron's sensibility and courage to write a story without having any previous experience as a screen-writer; 10/10 for a brilliant Kate Winslet, a beautiful and talented British actress who proved that acting skills do not have nationality nor beauty patterns. I had fun watching it. It made me feel like I was sharing the inner conflicts felt by the main characters. For its truth and audacity to tell a story already told a thousand times, I bow with respect.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Amazing,"I fell in love with this movie the first time I saw it. But what I sometimes get annoyed at (and Man in the Iron Mask had the exact same problem) is that everyone is oohing and awwing at Leo's hotness when they don't realize the philosophy behind it. The real message of this movie is that if we knew what would happen tomorrow, there would be no point in living. We just have to take things as they come because there is no predicting what tomorrow will hold. So basically, caution is life's curse. Another philosophical message of this movie which is also political is that we have no control over the lives we're born into. We just have to make the best of them. I love this movie and I wish others would appreciate it the same way that I do.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Not even God himself needed to sink the 'Titanic',"In 1912, humanity cried that ""Not even God himself could sink the Titanic"", the 'ship of dreams'; the indestructible symbol of mankind's modern achievements in maritime and industrialization. In 1998, celebrity cried that ""Not even God himself could sink the Academy awards and hyperbole of fame and recognition that was the film about the events 80 years earlier"".Well, look at it this way: Not even the divine and mighty God himself needed to sink the ship nor the film. Both the ship and its eponymous film representation sank after strong initial hype due to their paying comeuppance for pride and folly and getting found out of their own excesses in the long run. To begin with, the true story remains tragic because of the very fact that mankind overlooked, arrogantly so, the realities- failing to prepare (lifeboats a waste of deck space, class struggles, racism, rich & poor divides). In the end, mankind (regardless of whether the rich or poor caused the problems) paid the price of collective folly.The film, likewise, pays the price regardless of whether the executives who force-sold the distribution and caused the film to gain such unprecedented hype and reviews at first seemed so successful, really cared about more the bottom line. The film may have succeeded financially, but to me it still sank in the longer run. It made for a great emotional journey at first, but really, as we have to critique it at the level given its accolades, is nothing spectacular compared to something Capra-corn -'It's a Wonderful Life', which is emotionally powerful yet never gets cheesy.And, just like the real ship on her maiden voyage, it started off to controversy, followed by fanfare, and then tragedy. The reel version, nearly collapsed in budget controversy and then was bolstered by the biggest PR campaign complete with critics-wooing parties in the hopes of buying it around, thrusting the film as the most overpriced and embellished multi-million Hollywood machine- which turned off many and caused many more around the world to realize it for what it was- commercialism. Granted, that it's also a movie that because of its fame pervasive invasion on pop culture caused and still causes many to have an opinion about it (i.e. herd mentality discrediting/accrediting of the film along the lines of majority sentiment), I'll suggest that these ramifications of the film do not determine the film's genuine buoyancy. By buoyancy, I'm talking about the film's long term standing in the realms of other all time accredited films- the test if it really is a masterpiece.Of course, my entire dialogue here is based on the premise that because it swept awards, it has been rated a 'great film', of which I disagree with. I think the movie is found out upon repeat viewing, and I think even the majority of its fans (again remember to strip away the hype and the Leo Mania) don't really rate it as a great film per se. Plus, even here in the IMDb, why is the movie not recognized as a great film years after the initial awards fever? Because it has been found out over time for what it is- a decent film that stood out for its historical recreation (not facts in its entirety), and weaved alongside a trite love story on board the ship of fools, albeit being panoramic-ally beautiful. There are strong positives of course- special effects as well as sound and editing. But as you can see, they are all technical aspects, not in terms of classical film art.The film is a meticulous recreation and that is why I gave it 7/10, but it is not a GREAT film as say an intellectually challenging Fellini satirical commentary like 'And the Ship sails On'. It was panoramic-ally beautiful and had great costume design but it did not have, say, brilliant mise en scene that gives it nuance. In that sense, it is certainly not deserving of all of its accolades and accreditation.Nonetheless, I do not dispute its garnering gargantuan box office revenue worldwide as that was FOX's ultimate goal (even if Cameron had a personal crusade of sub-marine discovery). Essentially, when you wash away the DiCaprio mania (not to be discounted because it tied in substantial box office receipts), the hullabaloo of Oscar accreditation & aggressive marketing/advertising campaigns (successful from Bangkok to Rio DeJaneiro or HongKong might I add), you're left with a film that got found out as a victim of its own showy hype.Thus, film critics could never call it anymore than it was: popcorn fodder, and once teenagers outgrew their crushes, and people had witnessed the beautiful recreation of the ill-fated voyage that declared its pomp 80 years earlier, there was nothing left of this ship. It lies at the bottom of the sea save for nostalgic divers who yearn to return to their old sentiments, have issues to deal with or are disillusioned by the hype of past tragedy.Not even God himself needed to sink the ship or the film, there wasn't anything in it, unless people take the real message of what we can learn from Titanic: Respect God, be prepared, love and treat your fellow humans as equals, fight oppression, class segregation, battle the rich poor divide, celebrate freedom, and above all, to not get caught up in the excesses and hype of initial success. What we can learn from Titanic is that as pirated copies of the film are sold in Afghanistan or Cambodia by child slaves, the real tragedy in the world today is that we should focus not on the 1700 people who died, but turn our attention to the millions dying annually of inequalities. Marx or Kafka could probably tell us that you don't need God himself to remind us of that by sinking ships, and or, mass marketed popcorn billion dollar films.By Stephen Thanabalan",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"A bad script, saved by special effects","I felt mixed emotions at the end of this film, sadness, amusement, wonder and excitement. Firstly there are no spoilers in this review, so don't worry.I thought the main characters acting was poor, Kate Winslet really shown up in her worst film to date (pity, because Heavenly Creatures was so good) and Leonardo DiCaprio was nothing special compared to his performance in 'Man in the Iron Mask,' which was very good. However, some of the supporting characters did very well, and it was from them that the emotion was created. You really got a sense of terror and helplessness that they felt, without being clouded by very corny dialogue, like the lead characters were.The special effects were magnificant, well done to them. Definately a cinema film with plenty of stunning visuals, long shots and wide pan angles.  The ship looked fantastic and realistic.

Titanic,"It makes me question the legitimacy of modern-day film criticism when I see films like this constantly getting thrown under the bus for a supposed ""lack of substance"". The discussion surrounding the medium as a whole has been spat on for years due to the ludicrous mentality that big budget blockbusters somehow have less validity than arthouse cinema or anything else outside of the usual wide release theater-fare. All genres deserve to stand shoulder to shoulder with one another, as they're all pieces of art and should be appreciated as such.James Cameron's 'Titanic' released in 1997 and became an instant classic, though a somewhat controversial one. It shattered every record imaginable and won countless awards for its bold style, immaculate set design, and groundbreaking everything. It was huge, and the film itself compliments that sentiment. The biggest boat in the world, the greatest love story ever told, and the most tragic disaster of the century. The sheer scale and spectacle of this film is incredible. It was massive, and even with an industry now focused on world ending events and apocalypses of all shapes and sizes, it still remains massive today.'Titanic' follows Rose, a seventeen-year-old aristocrat who, despite her luxurious life, is unsatisfied and longs for something more. She meets and subsequently falls in love with Jack, a poor artist who won his ticket in a game of poker. A very basic setup, right? One that we've all seen a thousand times before. The difference is, this is the one that everyone remembers. This is what separates this love story from other love stories: It's memorable. Clichés aren't bad, I honestly believe that they're essential to storytelling. It's what you do with them that matters. James Cameron takes a somewhat basic love story about two people from different worlds falling in love with each other despite their differences and puts it inside a disaster of monumental scale. We all know that the unsinkable ship will inevitably sink, but its everything before that - the characters - the buildup - the overconfidence that all the passengers and crew uphold - it plants the idea in your head that maybe, just maybe, it'll be different this time. The events that transpire before the sinking is what makes it all the more impactful. If it was just a random ship filled with people you don't care about, it wouldn't affect you. Instead, it's a real world tragedy with characters that you've spent hours watching grow and evolve.Themes of perseverance, freedom, and love are represented beautifully here. Images like the violinists trying to maintain a sense of duty and composure amidst the chaos will forever be ingrained in my head. My Heart Will Go On by Céline Dion is not only a beautiful piece of music, but it connects to what I think is, the central theme of the film. Remembrance. Push forward, but never forget. Rose promises Jack to survive and live her life, but she'll always remember her short, but magical time on the ship all those years ago.Despite the groundbreaking nature of 'Titanic', that's not what first comes to mind when talking about this film. It's the characters, the journey, and the story that's captured the hearts of many moviegoers and film fans alike. That's what was discussed when it released, that's what we discuss now, and that's what will be discussed for generations to follow.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

It was disgusting - the PR, the story and the favorable box office response.Oh, once the ocean-liner hits the icebergs and the disaster starts, it's terrific but that's not until the last 45 minutes of this 194-minute movie. Too bad we had to wade through all the baloney before this climactic scene.The baloney, in a nutshell, was (1) a stupid teen romance between two arrogant, unlikeable people; (2) most the film being a lie, defaming many of the people who were heroes in that disaster, instead choosing to picture them as selfish villains.The latter is all in the name of 'political correctness,' some filmmakers like James Cameron, are filled with, something akin to horse manure.To make it brief: in real life, the men in the First Class did everything they could to get the women and children safely off the boat. Just look it up! Relatives of those people were justifiably extremely upset over Cameron's totally-fabricated story, and I can't blame them.Anyway, even with all the untruths, if they had cut down on the Leonardo DiCaprio-Kate Winslet rebel-type attitude and romance, it would have been a far better film, but then again you wouldn't have the billions of dollars in revenue from the 12-15-year-old girls who flocked by the millions to see this farce.

Holds up better than its namesake,"It's fair to say that 'Titanic' has forever earned its place in cinematic history. From its gripping, timeless subject matter to its decade-plus run as the highest-grossing film of all time, the James Cameron behemoth as indelibly left a mark on pop culture.Thanks to a gargantuan budget (the only way Cameron knows how to make a movie), the nearly four-hour blockbuster is part love story, part disaster flick. The film is carefully crafted through the narration of centenarian Rose (played beautifully by Gloria Stuart), which breaks up the flow from just a straight shot run through the many times told tale of the ship's doomed maiden voyage across the North Atlantic. But of course, the stars of the show are a young Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, as the two rode the wave of the success from this film to accelerate their already bright careers.The reason 'Titanic' works is because it's the perfect mix of drama, romance, action, suspense and history. It's not about telling a new story; it's about telling an old story through new perspectives. The recurring theme of societal status is full on display and harkens back to a timeless struggle. There's also the amazing special effects and CGI, which at the time were world class, and of course James Horner's unforgettable soundtrack (alongside the overplayed power ballad from Celine Dion).'Titanic' has been parodied to death over the years, but it still remains one of the best cinematic stories told in the past few decades.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"The Second Worst ""Best Picture"" in History","There is, in the Motion Picture Academy, a hidden criterion for awards. It's called the Miracle Factor.  If a huge, overblown spectacle film production manages to make a killing at the box office and isn't as bad a everyone thought it would be, it acknowledges this miracle with its Best Picture award.  This has happened at least twice:  in 1952, the malign, Red-baiting Cecil B. De Mille, bullied the corrupt, Red-baiting Academy into presenting him with an Oscar for the ridiculous circus spectacle, Greatest Show on Earth; then, in 1997, an equally corrupt, politically correct Academy presented Titanic with its Oscar.Titanic deserved an Oscar in only one category - special effects.  The story was trite, the acting mediocre (except Leo's, which didn't even get nominated), the editing OK (maybe deserving of an Oscar, since great special effects demand great editing).Titanic's ""beating"" out L.A. Confidential is akin to Greatest Show on Earth's ""beating"" out High Noon.  Standing alone, Titanic is just another disaster spectacle.  But placed beside a film like L.A. Confidential, Titanic becomes pure garbage.This view is no better vindicated than by the Academy's choice for Best Picture the following year, Shakespeare in Love.  If Titanic got the ""Miracle it Wasn't That Bad"" Oscar, then Shakespeare in Love was given the ""Bad Conscience for Titanic"" Oscar.By the way, if you want to see a GOOD dramatization of the Titanic disaster, get A Night to Remember instead of this travesty.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"James Cameron's ""Titanic"" is a movie that will forever be a classic.","The film is an action-packed romantic drama set during the maiden voyage of the ""unsinkable"" RMS Titanic. This coming-of-age story centered around 17-year-old Rose DeWitt Bukater, played by Kate Winslet, who is engaged to Cal Hockley, played by Billy Zane, an heir to a steel tycoon, but the marriage was arranged by her mother to maintain their ""high society"" status, after the death of her husband. However, Rose falls in love with a poor artist named Jack Dawson, played by Leonardo DiCaprio.The way Cameron uses of match cuts to tell the story is fantastic. He used this in a scene where the elderly Rose transitions to the young Rose we see on the ship. Another effective transition he used was jump cuts, which helped create a jarring effect, fitting for this tragic story. Additionally, crosscut editing was heavily used, particularly in the scene where Rose was looking for help to free Jack from custody in the master of arms office. The scene flashed back and forth from Jack trying to avoid the rising water to Rose racing up and down the halls looking for help.Cameron excelled in the area of music and sound effects. He used both visible and invisible sounds. Visible sounds, such as the musicians playing in the dining room, helped establish the elegant setting where only high-society people would be dining. However, it was the invisible sounds that were truly incredible. The creaking of the ship as it started to break apart and the clanking of the metal posts as people fell against them when the boat went down added a realistic factor to the movie.James Cameron is a master of creating these types of movies. Take his hit ""Avatar"", for example. Both movies are about two people from opposite worlds who fall in love with each other. In ""Titanic"", the contrasting worlds are high society and poverty, whereas in ""Avatar"" the contrast is between humans and the Na'vi people.

Taking Titanic seriously will end in disaster,"The announcement that James Cameron's 1997 blockbuster, Titanic, was to be rereleased to mark the centenary of the ocean liner's disastrous maiden voyage was met with a considerable amount of vitriol from historians and cultural critics.Alongside the somewhat more sober events set to take place on 15 April to commemorate the sinking of the 'unsinkable ship' - including an exhibition in Belfast, where RMS Titanic was built, and a series of seminars in Nova Scotia, close to where it sank - many saw this as Cameron once again cashing in on the tragedy with his fiercely sentimental film. The fact that it has been remastered in 3D has made its release feel all the more in poor taste.I was all of six years old when Titanic first hit our screens. It was, of course, one of the biggest blockbusters of my childhood. So large was its impact, in fact, that on several occasions during my schooling I was subjected to Titanic-themed history and art projects, all of which involved watching the three-and-a-bit-hour behemoth as a primary piece of research. In the years since, it has become the nostalgia movie of choice among my friends. So I've seen it more times than I'd care to count. Seeing it remastered on the big screen, however, made its inadequacy as a historical film more laughably evident than ever.Given the policed divide between the haughty classes of the upper decks and the lowly paupers of steerage, and the shameful priority given to the wealthy when it came to filling the lifeboats, the Titanic tragedy has often been held up as a telling snapshot of the class politics of the time. Through the star-crossed, and completely fictional, love affair between penniless rogue Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and drippy debutante Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet), Cameron attempts to explore the inherent tensions which the ship contained. This rendering, however, is reductive to say the least: the gilded dining rooms of first class are populated by sarcastic, brandy-swilling poshos and the steerage is full of arm-wrestling Germanics and Guinness-guzzling Irishmen who are prone to punch one another or break into a fiddle recital at the slightest provocation. Probably the most coherent message about class we are given, as the two lovers move between their respective camps, is that it's much more fun to dance a jig below decks than it is to discuss oil prices over caviar.The stories that survived the ship's demise are a mix of startling inhumanity and incredible heroism. But Cameron's manipulative approach often robs his material of its inherent pathos and breeds drastic historical inaccuracies. In its turbulent second half, poignant moments come thick and fast, but many of them are either wholly fictional or shamelessly skewed for the sake of taking some cheap tugs at the heartstrings. The 'unsinkable' Molly Brown, who in the real tragedy insisted the half-full lifeboats return to collect those still stranded in the ice-cold water, is robbed of her triumphant moment and recast as a much less domineering symbol of feminine subordination. Similarly, as is widely known, the ship's string quartet played on top deck as the Titanic went down, in order to calm the passengers, but even this incredible part of the tale is soured by the schmaltz Cameron lays over the scene. As the quartet finish their rendition of 'Orpheus and Eurydice', one of the violinists turns to his fellow musicians and says, 'Gentleman, it has been a privilege playing with you tonight'. Such candy-coated moments continually deaden the impact of the film's rich source material.Cameron once quipped that he only agreed to make the film because a free deep sea dive to the Titanic wreck came as part of the package, suggesting this was never intended to be his magnum opus. Indeed, given the director's famous meticulousness, the film feels like he has been oddly careless in places. Kate Winslet's accent is allowed to wander between American, Irish and English with little consequence, and despite a rigorous casting process for the part of Rose's malevolent fiancé Cal - which saw innumerable famous actors rejected - the appalling Billy Zane was selected, who ends up playing the role like a camp Count Dracula.Despite all this, the clunking one-liners, the dreadful acting and the cheesy artifice actually gives Titanic its distinctive charm. When watching the released film on the big screen, I was surprised to find that most of my fellow audience members were giggling along at all of the abysmal moments, which also had kept me returning to it over the years. For myself and others it seems, this film is more of a trip down 90s memory lane than it is an historically accurate snapshot of a turn-of-the-century tragedy. As such, criticising Titanic on the grounds of historical infidelity is tantamount to damning Top Gun for giving a rose-tinted portrayal of the lives of fighter pilots - doing so would be to miss the point of what makes these films so memorable.I completely agree with those who feel Titanic has no place in the proceedings for the centenary of the original tragedy. Not because Cameron's tacky blockbuster does a disservice to the 1,517 people who lost their lives, but because this film is so inescapably naff that really it shouldn't be taken that seriously. I urge fans to go and enjoy this guilty pleasure with a clear conscience",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

A True Masterpiece!,"I first saw this movie in theatres. When it came out, I was skeptical. I am not a overly-enthusiastic about the majority of historical movies but, I decided to give this one a try. I remember it like yesterday. Walking into that theatre and smelling the scent of popcorn. There was a short line in front of the room where I was to watch the film because people were trying their best to get in on time. I picked a seat up front (even though I prefer to sit a bit farther back), and I got ready to view the film. The lights dimmed and the entire room fell silent. I remember that at the beginning of the film, I was slightly bored. The opening few scenes were different than most movies I had watched back then. But, as the film went on, I grew more and more excited to see what would happen next and I actually became invested deeply into the story. The intense ending with the ship sinking was scary - yet epic! And, when the movie came to a close I was thrilled. I had enjoyed it more than I ever thought I possibly would. I decided to buy it on VHS a few months later, and I played it for my (then teenage) kids. They loved it as well.There was not a single scene in this movie where I thought: maybe this isn't a great film or maybe this was a waste of time. Every single moment was another awesome moment and Leonardo and Kate's interaction with each other on screen felt genuine and real.

If that is not the concept that soap operas take to unbearable lengths, don't know what it is.The movie does not shed much light over the social classes or condition at the time (can do that, but it is somehow marginal), does not depict very deep characters (they may be, but they do not waste time self analysing), and the story is focused on one thing - to be compelling, and appropriately match the huge ship and its story. That is all. It does not even mirror the Titanic story, it just uses it as a background. And it keeps one glued to the screen by taking all they could and investing it into the characters and details, with the force specific to British productions, frankly, when you have to take them seriously just because they take themselves so seriously.The rest is just glorifying the mass effect, turning a human drama (or tragedy) -movie into a legend.

The movie that made my face list to the right,"Surely millions of people worldwide, a billion dollars and 11 Oscars can't be wrong can they? Well yes, actually.The problem with Titanic is that Cameron treats the whole enterprise like one of his action pictures, replete with the kind of staging you'd expect from that genre, but not alas, from a dramatisation of a genuine tragedy. Cameron has no faith in the emotional weight of the historical facts, and if we were being cynical we could also say no interest. This is an exercise in ego and directorial hubris from the outset, namely the idea that the writers fictional teenage romance - a story that never succeeds in rising above its clichéd origins, is required to connect a contemporary audience to the events of 1912. You can see the logic because clearly the world's worst peacetime maritime tragedy, 1,500 dead and the planets most luxurious ocean liner sinking on its maiden voyage isn't an interesting enough story in itself. Subsequently the titular ship becomes merely a backdrop for a populist voyage into tedium. Just as you'd feel uneasy at the prospect of Michael Bay doing Jane Austen, Cameron doing period romance seems a little far fetched. Jack and Rose allow us to spend some time on the ship prior to its sinking and an impressive recreation it is but you'd quite like them to go away so we could see what the real passengers were up to. That he sustains momentum throughout this picture is despite his script, rather than because of it. His talent for pacing and moving a story forward serves him well in this respect but with fictional characters as one note as these, and with the ships real passengers reduced to supporting parts to bolster Cameron's mills and boon narrative, we, unlike the real passengers are quite grateful to see the Iceberg emerging from the watery depths.Once the ship hits the film moves up a gear and suddenly there is enough to sustain interest until the stilted syrup drenched epilogue. However, Cameron still stages the sinking like one giant set piece which saps the film of any emotional impact. A real tribute to the ship, rather than a cynical exercise in emotional manipulation would have taken an objective position and allowed the real events to unfold, giving us a chance to take in the full force of real events. This film concerns itself with fiction and doing so attempts to tell you what to feel and when to feel it. For me, this has the opposite effect and the scenes toward the end featuring Winslet and Decaprio are virtually unwatchable.The production design is superb and its all very epic and grandiose but ultimately Titanic is a disappointment because it takes a real tragedy and turns it into populist entertainment. History for people not interested in History. If you think thats a harsh assessment then imagine a similar scenario applied to a retelling of the September 11th attacks and think how inappropriate that would seem. These people may be 90 odd years dead but they deserve more respectful treatment than this. Watch ""A night to remember"" (1958) for a far better depiction of events which was informed by accounts of the sinking not by one man who thought he had something to 'add' to this terrible event.

Whats wrong with this movie?,"Thats the question that DiCapitated-lovelorn girls ask themselves when someone like me tells 'em that this movie really truly sucks. I went with my girlfriend (she is not a DiCaprio-lovelorn girl, she actually thinks he's gay) to the theatre to see this movie. I thought it would be a good movie to watch with her, since its basically a chick flick, and she would be happy after the movie, and really happy with me for wanting to go with her, I just wanted to make her happy. But those three hours in that theatre seemed to go longer than any In School Suspension that I have ever served in school. And believe you me, ISS is the most boringest part of school. I mean, at least in class you got your friends and chicks to check out, but ISS is like a prison.

Rose's life is purely a drama arranged by others, and it requires you to have outstanding acting skills, for her who is unwilling to degenerate, restless and self-contained, pursuing self-existence, and freely showing her own value, she is simply unbearable, miserable, so she will often run outside the cabin to blow the wind, so that Jack can see the first side of Rose from afar. The talented Jack saw through Rose, and saved Rose when she had rebellious suicidal thoughts, and then it was logical that there was a reason for further relationships, their bold enthusiasm and chic just contrasted with Hollick's dull and stubborn and pedantic aristocratic image, and naturally Rose and Jack sparked a spark of passion, when the ship hit the iceberg, they were immersed in love, Hollick framed Jack for stealing the Heart of the Ocean and locked him in the bottom of the boat in order to maintain his self-esteem, Later, it took a lot of courage for Rose to rush down to save him without hesitation, but it was a kind of courage full of hope, and she didn't have time to think about the possibility of dying here, instinctively thinking that she might have misunderstood Jack and wanted to rescue Jack, that's all. Including the later Jack on the edge of life and death, leaving the life-saving board to Rose also reflects more of a kind and good person's most human outburst, the power of love is huge, but the selfless nature of reasonable people is also indispensable.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Historically Accurate for its Time, Yet is Hindered by it being Directed by James Cameron","One of the interesting things about this film is that it's pretty clear how Titanic and Avatar are both cut from, essentially, the same cloth despite being two completely different films on paper.As it is widely understood, a lot of time, effort, and money went into making this film possible and it shows. Aside from a couple moments here and there, Titanic is still a fairly impressive looking film to date. Of course, nowadays there is more information about Titanic's interior design with the aid of 20 more years of research behind us and, thus, there are some inaccuracies in this film in that regard, as well as the way the ship sank, but overall, it is clear that they went to painstaking lengths to make this film look as accurate and authentic as possible and I think they succeeded. Of course when you have James Cameron at the helm, usually films end up turning out looking quite impressive so it's no surprise that this film would be any different.However, James Cameron is also one of the reasons why this film falls very short of what it could have been. This has much to do with the quality of writing and its execution. Cal Hockley is little short of a diet James Bond villain and I have no idea what his motivations for pursuing his obviously aloof fiancee aside from serving as an antagonist for Jack. The guy shows no interest in Rose, yet he says he loves her and it seems like the film, at some point, is trying to frame him as being truthful about it- but who knows at this point? On top of that, there's also the same writing trap that this film fall into as Avatar would years later with the very cartoonish poor people good, rich people bad theme which only ages worse when one looks into the real reasons why ships of that time were organized by class.There's also a lot of blatant misrepresentation when it comes to a myriad of issues including the crew of the Titanic and the ship's lifeboat situation-which are all comments made with the aide of hindsight- which makes for a pretty bad representation of history.One of my biggest criticisms of this kind of love story is that usually the female lead is fairly plain and the male lead is where all the personality and likability is. For Titanic, the reverse is true. Rose is extremely likable and has a lot of personality and Kate Winslet is the star of the show, in my opinion. Jack is quite plain on the other hand. I know DiCaprio is a popular actor but I didn't feel as if he really added anything to this role. It just seemed that they hired him to play himself.Despite my criticisms, this is still a pretty well-made film. It has a lot of issues but it is still worth seeing. The love story is predictable but I don't think people watch romance films for their expectations to be subverted anyway. It's far from a bad film, and despite its 3 hour run time it makes excellent use of it. This is probably the date night film to end all date night films until The Notebook came out at the very least that says something.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

It's the little things,"I was just wandering the city one day, seeing the city lights, so I went to see it. Titanic. The big movie, that everybody went and talked about.I'll go straight to the point and won't go as to say anything about the plot. We've all gotten that in by force I think. What I find good about this movie are the small things. Not where everything is focused upon: Decaprio and Kate obviously. The movie has much personality, so love it or hate it; you'll find something about Titanic that feels personal. I won't let out what I think was my favorite part of the movie.Titanic is, yes, a good movie. I would be blind if I didn't see the beauty of this movie. But, maybe Titanic is too much larger then life. When watching it, you fail to remember reality. It all seems all too Hollywood, with Decaprio's face on the dollar bill with Titanic in the background.Titanic tells us about every living thing on the ship (or so it seems) even the rats get a little spotlight in. But the whole thing seems still to evolve just two characters. So, it seems to me that the movie gets too shallow: Sinking a ship just to get a good love story? Ah well, maybe I'm too picky? Titanic is good though. Guess where my favorite part of the movie is? You'll never guess it. I'll give you a clue. Somewhere along the sinking scene. :) Enjoy the movie.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
AMAZING!!!,"I absolutely adore this movie, the plot, the actors, the romance, drama, tension, AMAZING. If you have a free night and have nothing to do, literally watch this, it's great. The plot is just WOW, theres some comedic scenes to cheer the mood up and james cameron does a great job of that, no wonder this film had received 11 oscars? You could watch this 20 times and never get sick of it, it's great, kate winslet, leonardo dicaprio, kathy bates, all of them and even more people i could list do a great job in creating this atmosphere. The movie is rich, it looks and feels rich, the language, old times, the plot is amazing, finding out that rose is still alive but basically 100 years old is a great add on to the movie, 3 hours for this movie almost seems too little, i'd love to see even more of the relationships between the characters, honestly for a 1997 film too, the quality and the effects are just AMAZING.

What's not to love about this movie? It has everything you can think of...love, drama, humour, visuals, emotions. Just perfect. It also had some really funny moments which I didn't expect but it was cool. Though for me the best part of the movie is the music which is just....heavenly.

Zarina,"I saw this film long ago but remember that it took my breath away and we are still talking about this movie.
The fictional story of two main actors was absolutely beautiful. Kate Winslet was gorgeous as Rose and i couldn't imagine anyone else playing this role. And Leonardo DiCaprio was really good as Jack. The acting is first-rate. Leonardo Di Caprio's and Kate Winslet's performance is so brilliant that I cried during the whole movie.
This movie has it all; drama, action, romance and it makes the viewer fall in love with each and every scene. Also it is very close to the real tragedy. It shows a beautiful love story with an extremely sad ending.It's emotionally so powerful that it breaks the viewer into tears.
If you want to cry and melt down to a glamurous love story, I strongly recommend that you watch this movie. Titanic is well worth seeing.AizereTitanic is very tough movie to watch and this film is directed by James Cameron.The film is not new, but does not go out of fashion, does not leave indifferent even a person who is used to constantly hide emotions. Shown fear and love. It is instructive and even interesting to look at the behavior of people from the side, as if with the actors of the film you are experiencing what is happening in the film. Sometimes it seems that this is reality, but pincing yourself by the arm you understand that this is only a film. There is no pretense in the game of actors, it pleases me.I really liked the film, I can't even say exactly what, just EVERYTHING with which it was made. Watching it, I feel myself there on the Titanic, after the film I immediately begin to have a value in life, I would never want to die like these people who were on board. I would even like to see the Titanic myself with my own eyes at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.The film has touched my soul so much that I don't think there is a film that will surpass the Titanic in its drama. This is my favorite movie from melodramas, and one of my favorite films in general. I really advice to watch this masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Possibly Most Overrated Film Ever,"I don't know where all these people get off defending this movie, I think most would agree its not a bad film. It is simply not anywhere near good enough to warrant the hype/accolades it achieved.How this movie set a record for Oscar victories and gross sales, I'll never know. It's a story everyone already knew. They thought the ship was unsinkable, it sunk, a lot of people on board died. I've known this since 4th grade...I think the world has know since 1918.The angle of approach is equally unoriginal and not clever. A story of forbidden love. Wow, I had never heard a story of forbidden love before, because I live in a hole on Saturn.When you take a well known story, and focus on an over done plot line within that story, naturally much of your audience will be bored.

"""Titanic"" in Every Sense of the Word","What really stands out to me is the high value production that is still very impressive to me twenty-five years after the movie set sail. Great special effects that combine some (admittedly dated) CGI effects with huge sets and dozens of extras that all make the movie a marvel to witness. Truly a movie that deserves to be scene on the big screen and not on television.Unfortunately my main gripe comes with, as many have also pointed out over the years, a bit of a generic social class-based romance plot. A lot of the scenes are nice, and Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet have great chemistry (being both stars' breakout roles), but it really comes down the execution being a bit of a bore and little substance here. I would have liked to see some more light shed on the crew's perspective; the panic realizing that there was nothing to be done and the desperate measures taken to ensure the survival of some of the passengers. Also some more story on the Carpathia finding the life boats and their response to the distress signals. The aftermath of the news breaking out to the rest of the world. Stuff like that.A good movie but lacking just a tad in the storytelling department; I would have gladly eschewed the romantic plot for one that placed more emphasis as a disaster thriller.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

A computer generated ship with generated seagulls looks exactly that. The sets are spectacular yet manage to scream out that they are expensive sets rather than that they are the inside of a living working ship. And don't get me started on the levels of my indifference towards the talentless Mr.DiCaprio who bestrides the film in the same way as most children do when stumbling into a grown-ups party.

Great movie!,"This film is about a love triangle that happens on the Titanic. The Titanic, the ship of dreams, is also known as ""The Unsinkable"".

Iv seen better Titanic films,"When I first saw this film, I absolutely loved it, as I got carried away with the fantastic special effects, good acting and great soundtrack. However, in order to realise what this film is truly about, you have to watch it at least twice in order to understand that this film is a load of ignorant and political nonsense.First of all, the storyline was completely ridiculous and unreal. The fact that a hoodlum vagrant like Jack Dawson(Leonardo Dicaprio) could possibly seduce a highly sophisticated lady such as Kate Winslet(Rose De Witt Bukater) is impossible. Having a fling with him is possible, but to have left her successful rich Fiancé Billy Zane (Caledon Hockley) for Jack Dawson would never happen in real life. Second of all, this film had untrue facts to what really happened at the Titanic tragedy and its main focus was to praise the Irish and to racistly put down the British. The fact that the British boat loader gunned-down the Irish hoodlum, never actually happened in history, as that man was a hero, not a murderer. Also, the fact that the British racistly locked the Irish in the third class section when the Titanic was sinking was untrue to the way it was portrayed. Yes, the third class section was probably locked up in the basement when the Titanic was sinking, however it was a class issue, not a racist issue. There were just as many European and British people in the third class section, as there were Irish and many Irish people in the first and second class section as well. So the fact that the third class people were locked up in the basement because they were Irish was completely nonfactual. Besides which, statistics show that more Irish people survived the Titanic disaster than any other nationality on that boat.Last of all, for James Cameron to write and direct a love story based on the Titanic tragedy is totally insensitive and disrespectful to the victims, family and descendants of the Titanic tragedy. There's nothing wrong with making a film based on the Titanic disaster, but to make a fictional romantic love story on the Titanic disaster is completely wrong. Whats next - James Cameron directing a romantic love story about a couple who fell in love in the New York Twin Towers(9/11) disaster on the day it collapsed, with people jumping out of windows (with heartfelt music in the background) and hitting the ground. Now that would be truly sick. Anyway, if you've never seen this film and would like to see it, I suggest you view it at least twice as that'll be the only way you'll truly understand the real meaning of the film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A sinking feeling.,"'Titanic (1997)' is bogged down by arguably unnecessary modern day sequences, its run-time sailing well beyond the time it actually took for its eponymous ship to sink. These opening and closing moments are what started Cameron's seemingly unending obsession with deep-sea documentation and, in some ways, seem a little too indulgent. However, they do add a layer of theming to the thing and sort of explain the director's motives in making a massively budgeted, romantically focused epic out of one of the most well-known tragedies of the twentieth century. Once the piece progresses into its bulk, it starts to become a lot more interesting. The film revels in its splendid set-design and CG-enhanced environments, marvelling at its own ability to aptly convey the period and paying immense attention to even the smallest of details (though it's apparently content with 'filling in the gaps' any way it pleases). At times, the picture feels rather self-congratulatory, to be honest. However, this confidence is mostly well-placed; the movie did, after all, make over a billion dollars. Just because it made money doesn't mean it's automatically good, though. It's undeniably messy and slow, somewhat confused as to whether it wants to be a straight-forward historical tragedy or an alternate-history 'against all odds' romance (and that's not even mentioning the reflexive, somewhat self-aware vibes of the modern day stuff). Having said that, it's effective on more than one occasion. Some of the romantic banter between its leads is charming, as is their overall relationship, and the 'clash of the classes' angle is generic but enjoyable. Any time DiCaprio and Winslet share the screen, the film is fairly entertaining. However, it doesn't get properly gripping until the DVD asks you to change disks halfway through. This latter half is dedicated, almost entirely, to the sinking of the ship. This is a well-known fact and, frankly, a key selling point of the picture, so it isn't exactly a surprise. Yet, the extended sequence does a good job of maintaining tension by introducing mini conflicts which don't have a pre-determined end. This segment contains some visually spectacular stuff, as water floods corridors or crushes characters against gates and the whole ship turns on its side as it sinks to the depths below. Thankfully, this stuff isn't beautiful; it's devastating. Some of it is really suspenseful, too. It's the most successful aspect of the piece, for sure - although it does feature a shot that demonstrates literally the worst 'face replacement' I've ever seen. When it comes down to it, the flick isn't as impactful as it should have been. It struggles to balance its two major elements, feels unnecessarily long and is often somewhat self-indulgent (and, thus, rather dull). It is, however, a visually spectacular and occasionally charming experience with a highly effective final third. It's long and uneven, but it's probably worth a go if you're a fan of DiCaprio, Winslet, Cameron or, somewhat strangely, historical tragedies. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Best Picture?????????,"Are there lesser films in execution and entertainment? Of course. But I felt a ""One"" vote was deserved here for the overratedness of this movie by box-office and awards. I think the Oscars should be embarrassed this won all those Oscars, including Best Picture. As another commenter pointed out, it is funny that such a bloated film won ""Best Editing"". Honestly, this winning Best Picture would be like ""Ghost"" winning that award: a popular, sappy movie with pretty leads.. Only this lacks the actually humorous Whoopi...The ""romance"" is laughable. I like Winslet. She has at least tried to steer clear of this type of stuff since. Actually, mostly, so has DeCrapio...Malcolm X and Gandhi's lives: those are worthy of three hours(plus) of film..NOT this ""eternal romance""..Some people are simply impressed by the sinking. I'm sorry, but if there isn't one person on the ship I care about, the sinking does not mean much to me. Spectacle? Try nature. Go watch a volcano...BTW, I will say I think it is hilarious that people refer to Winslet as a ""cow"" in this because she isn't an anorexic actress. I honestly initially was perplexed whom they were even referring to, because Bates isn't even all that fat. Like they wouldn't want Kate as their girlfriend? Come on...I would certainly never want to see this one again...The script fails to portray an ""eternal love"". Rather it gives us a bit of lust. While it is believable Winslet doesn't want to be permanently with Zane, why she has to be with Leo is not shown...I t is encouraging that this is not in the IMDb Top 250...Perhaps the worst film to ever win Best Picture.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Complete perfection,"I saw the hype of this movie and immediately thought it would be too much, and I decided not to see it in theatres. I made a huge mistake. In 2001, I saw it on television and couldn't believe it.This movie has an amazing script that kept me watching. The love story made me sigh and cry! Not saying what happens! Even though most people already know. Might be spoilers ahead! Anyways, the Jack and Rose story was enough for me, but after Titanic hit the iceberg it was like a completely different movie! I loved how they kept the love story ""afloat"" (haha) while the ship was sinking.There are so many elements to this movie that I can't even explain. Every time I watch it, I cry for Jack. Every single time. The fact that he loved her enough to sacrifice his life.. Wow. I mean, I can't get a man to open a door for me! Let alone, give me the door to float on while he freezes to death! That's love.The way this film plays out is amazing. All the special effects, the costumes, the acting! Don't even get me started about the acting! And even things right down to the sound the Lookout's bell makes. But.. I have to say, after the 80th time I watched the movie (or around there somewhere) I started to notice that some of the lines are just a little bit TOO cheesy. But that really is the only flaw in the 194 minutes of perfection.Some people I know won't watch the film because of the long running time.

Never has a film inspired such emotion in me, such a feeling of belonging to the thrills and struggles of the characters on the screen. The music, a rich blend of instrumental and vocal, is far from archaic. It inspires emotional power that would have otherwise been lost. The story is obviously well-researched, the images are heartbreaking and breathtaking, and, unlike many epics, Titanic is not arrogant, and it does not drag on. In fact, despite its being one of the longest movies I have ever seen, it felt rushed. It was over too soon. It was that good. I did not even think that the love story was that distracting from the grandeur. It was just another human aspect masterfully explored by the film: greed, hate, panic, and, above all, love, a love so profound, so passionate, that it should inspire viewers with envy, not laughter. No, Titanic is as close to flawless as anything can get. With characters that should rightfully be hated and loved, characters to whom we can all relate, a recapture of the world of the past and the ship itself synonymous to a time machine, and a story replete with comedy, tragedy, and thrill, Titanic is a classic that time can never erode, and that shall always inspire laughter and tears.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
what   7.1?,"OK, i don't know what everyone else was thinking while voting, but i'd sure like to voice my opinion...loudly.1. i'm very disappointed with the limited recognition this beautiful movie has on IMDb. i would expect more from movie lovers.2. it's very hard to find a movie that all ages can enjoy with comedy, tragedy, truth and love. which Titanic clearly delivers.3. acting was outstanding, not to mention the unforgettable music and effects.Titanic, in my opinion, is a milestone in leo's and kate's careers.

One Of The Best Movies Ever Created!,"Titanic enriches us with a romantic story of young love, passion and feelings, full of utopias and dreams, mother and child fighting for power and greed, idealistic and self-identified clashes within a consenting human ambitions society and victims of their own vanity and pomposity. This is one of the films that most shocked the general public in the last twenty years. The huge collections that are logical because they got obvious that Titanic has one of those stories full of strength and feeling, with great dramatic content. If we add the stunning beauty of the image, thanks to advances in digital technology, success is understandable. Very successful movie, which tells the story of the sinking of the ship, but in the background shows a passionate love story. It achieves a harmonious balance in that, in the mix of history and feelings, and makes it almost perfect.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
horrible attempt to combine romance and disaster,"While Cameron, the director, felt ""a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster,"" both the romance and the disaster failed. I loved the first part of the film, but my interest quickly lost after the second part began.
The power of the first part of the film lies in its exploration of social class -- my heart melted upon seeing how Jack attempts to behave like an upperclassman and how Rose enjoys Jack's company and his surrounding. I agree this kind of story sounds cliché and the encounter between Rose and Jack is unlikely, but this love story realizes the fairy tale that everyone of us deeply relates and dreams to become true.
However, the second part of the film immediately feels fake, kitsch, superficial and classist. It is lengthy and even melodramatic. For one thing, the most dangerous moment happens probably where Cal goes after Rose and Jack. The film abstains from any realistic and profound depiction of deplorable living condition in light of a disaster. Focusing on Rose, her family and her love interests, the film stages other common people as mere backdrop of the love story of an aristocrat. In the end, it becomes evident that Rose would survive and live a happy life anyway, which promptly overshadows the very existence and sacrifice of Jack.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Still works for me...,"Well, it's been a year since my last review of this film (this is review #3).  I saw ""Titanic"" on the big screen in 1997, and bought the DVD when it came out (which I still watch from time to time, maybe about twice/year).""Titanic"" still works for me as an epic spectacle and blockbuster.  The love story is OK, I don't really care... this is the movie to watch for eye candy and epic scope, not emotion.  I never did get caught up in any sobby or sentimental emotions with this film.  The overall story isn't bad... yes, some of the lines are cheesy and the dialog is corny, so what?  The low point of the film has to be DiCaprio sinking beneath the waves... not sad at all to me, but so what?""Titanic"" stands as a fabulous spectacle and a great movie watching experience.  The years have not diminished that in the least, and the special effects couldn't be done any better today than they were in 1997. The nit-pickers are still picking, 'sentimentalists' are still getting outraged at the 'realists' bashing the film, and I'm still sitting back and enjoying a couple times a year a film that was highly overrated at the Oscars (so what else is new) but where every penny of the budget shows on the screen... the spectacle of it... the scope, it can sweep you away.

A Titanic movie of epic preportion.,"Based on a true story the film re-lives the horrors of when the real Titanic sank. As well as that, a poor boy( Leonardo DiCaprio)strikes up a romance with a rich daughter(Kate Winslet). It was one of the movie that seemed so real-in breath taking detail. As I said earlier, I thought I wouldn't like this film, but once i watched it last night, I can't blame other people for complaining about it only getting a 7 out of 10 (on average). Billy Zane plays a great role as the controlling boyfriend. There is something special about this movie. VERY special. Sometimes the special effects are a bit cheesy, but its convincingly covered up by the extremely tense scenes. This film made me feel extremely depressed but at the same time I couldn't look away.The acting is marvelous as well as the make up, trying to look like the clothes of old.James Cameron- I raise my glass to you as although this story is based on a true story-it will be remembered for a very long time.A classic.10/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Am I alone???,"I will start with some positive comments, the setting of the movie was definitely incredible, the final hour had some very intense moments and overall was just about enjoyable, however.....When you get past the initial razzle dazzle of the film and actually sit and think about what you just watched, it really starts hitting home how mediocre the movie really was.The script is a prime example of where the movie falls flat, to put it very bluntly it was awful. The supposed witty and funny comments, such as the comment about ""Sigmund Freud"", came across as so very tacky.The plot was just as bad as the script. Underneath the glitz was really just a very bland love story.I guess my other big gripe was the length, did it really need to be that long? Personally I don't think so. It could have cut the film a great deal, leaving a much better end result.I have to asked myself whether I'm being to critical, considering the millions(billions??) that it returned in profits.

Timeless,"It's bitterly ironic that the biggest blockbuster of all time is not on the IMDb's Top 250. Even stranger still, many who loved it at the time of its release have now turned on it (just ask anyone under the age of 25). This is not due to its quality, but to its hype. It goes without saying that a film this big had immense publicity at the time of its release, but what no one learned until too late is that there is too much of a good thing. People began to tire of hearing about what the stars (especially the new heartthrob Leonardo DiCaprio) were doing, and they were sick of hearing gossip magazines never shutting up about ""Titanic."" The film had the odds against it: it's a romance, and that is one of the most volatile genres in terms of popularity. By the time the spoofs of the film's most famous scenes came along, ""Titanic's"" reputation was already in danger. After that, people began only to see the spoofs, and now the film's popularity has sunk to where the real ship is.I had fond memories of the film from when it was popular, so I decided to perform an experiment: even after the immense backlash the film suffered, could it still hold up? The answer is a resounding YES!""Titanic"" opens when a treasure hunter, Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) finds a drawing of a woman wearing the diamond that he is looking for. Soon after releasing his findings, an elderly woman (Gloria Stuart) claims that it's her in the picture. So Lovett flies her out to his ship to tell her the story behind the diamondAs a young woman, she was sailing to America to live the life of a boring society lady in a loveless marriage. Planning on ending it all, she is about to jump ship when she is saved by a young man from steerage. Thus begins a classic love story that is doomed from the start by complications other than those they began with.The reason the film is so good is because the two central characters are brilliantly written and acted. Leonardo DiCaprio became an instant heartthrob to girls around the world (something he apparently hated), and it's not hard to see why. DiCaprio has everything to make the male lead of an epic romance work: he's good-looking and talented (Winslet was honored with an Oscar nomination for her performance, although it's hard to understand why DiCaprio was left out, because he equals her). Jack Dawson is an immensely likable guy. He falls hard for Rose, someone who he knows is clearly out of his league. But he's so immensely likable that we want him to win Rose's heart. His new lover, Rose, is no ordinary society girl, much as she tries. She can't stand the rigidly controlled life she's going to lead, and Jack is her escape. But while she may wear a corset, she's no damsel in distress. She's independent and tough. The romance works because Jack and Rose are meant for each other.Their supporting cast is excellent. The two most important supporting characters are Rose's fiancée, Cal Hockley, and her mother, Ruth (Frances Fisher). Cal Hockley is a vicious snob with a constant sneer on his face. He comes from a wealthy family, and will do anything to get what he wants. He demands obedience from Rose, something she will not give (to anyone, much less Cal). Her mother, Ruth, is just as snobbish and cruel, but she's also desperate. Their family was left virtually penniless, and she's trying to save face. As cruel and despicable as they are, neither one becomes a caricature. Zane and Fisher should have dually been honored with awards for their acting. Bates is especially noteworthy as the delightfully brash ""new money"" Molly Brown.""Titanic"" was the most expensive film of the 20th century, and it's clear that every penny was put to good use. ""Epic"" doesn't begin to describe this movie. It's huge in spectacle, and the sinking of the ship, which takes up the last half hour, is jaw-dropping. But that's not the only place where the effects were used. We never get a sense that we're looking at sets or CGI; from every frame of the ship, we believe that we are on the ship with the characters. Interesting note: Cameron actually went down to the wreckage and filmed footage there. But that doesn't stop there. Cameron wrote a script that allows us to view every part of the ship (and in a way that's plausible.James Cameron has long been considered a god of action movies, but this is the first time his skills were honored. Not only is Cameron a wizard with special effects, he is also a master storyteller. ""Titanic"" is a long film (as all epics are), but not one of the 3+ hours of footage is wasted. The film moves, and there is never a dull spot. He knows the speed at which a person gets involved in the story, and uses this to his advantage. But the biggest accomplishment is that he makes the romance, one of the most difficult genres to dabble in, work with immense effectiveness. The romance burns up the screen, so much that we're more concerned with Jack and Rose's fates than we are taking in the sight of the sinking ship. And the scene where Jack draws Rose's picture is potently erotic (especially for a PG-13 movie, which shows not real nudity or sex, but it is strongly implied).I realize that I am not writing this to people who haven't seen the movie (are there such people?). I am writing it to those who are now convinced that this is a sappy and painfully bad film. I assure you: it's as good as it was the first time you saw it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"A Classic, Sweeping Love Story","I fell in love with this movie instantly after viewing it for the first time. Many people ridicule this film for its idealistic and often 'mushy' romance, and for the lovers' passionate relationship after being acquainted for no more than two days. Of course, perhaps 'Titanic' isn't the most believable story of all time, but in my eyes it's certainly one of the most entertaining. I don't watch movies to see reality, I see enough of that every day. If reality is what I had been hoping for when viewing 'Titanic', I would have been sorely disappointed in the love story (despite it's breathtakingly accurate portrayal of the ship's infamous death).No, 'Titanic' is more of a fairytale, one that sweeps you away and holds your attention until it's ending. It is the unforgettable tale of Jack, a poor but kind-hearted street urchin, and Rose, a wealthy but misunderstood young woman. When fate brings them together on the first and last voyage of the Titanic, they must face many trials and tribulations in order to pursue their forbidden love. Keeping them apart is Rose's mother, who insists that her daughter marry a stuck-up rich man, and Cal, Rose's malicious fiancé to whom she is to be wedded by force. While Jack and Rose are willing to face these odds for each other, there are some things which cannot be faced down, one of them being an iceberg, the ultimate destruction of their relationship.Despite its joyous fairytale like aspects, it is still very tragic. A feel-good romance and a tragic epic all in one, like a brilliant cross between 'Romeo and Juliet' and 'Cinderella'. For the first half of the movie I was overwhelmed with a wonderful feeling. For the second half I was near tears. Finally, the movie's amazing conclusion was sending chills down my spine, and I felt as if I couldn't decide if I was happy or sad.Leanardo DiCaprio is mischievous yet sweet-natured as Jack, and masterfully brings across what is, in my opinion, the most memorable and lovable role in the entire film. I found Kate Winslet almost, yet not quite, as impressive as DiCaprio in her role as Rose, who although seeming perfectly content and fortunate outwardly is misunderstood and desperately miserable inside. Jack sees this hidden part of her, recognizing her longing for freedom and helps her to fulfill it. The remaining cast shines as well.Watch this movie. Enjoy it. Forget the real world, and lose yourself in 'Titanic'.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Great direction,"Titanic was an excellent film, but definitely not because of anything Leo or Kate did.  They, in my opinion, were just crowd attraction techniques. They could have used anyone for these roles and the movie would have been improved/worsened only slightly.The real reason this movie was excellent was because of Jim Cameron's undying devotion to the project's perfection.  He did countless retakes of key scenes, got behind the camera himself many times, and made sure every part of the movie matched the picture in his mind.  He even drew the portraits himself!  If all directors would put this much into their films, there would be no shortage of quality films, as there have been in past years.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"boat sinks, out $7.00","All right, we get the picture about the great special effects, etc. The *grand scale* everything was done in. I still, after all of my time on this earth, find it hard to believe that people can be brainwashed SO much by media hype.I'm not about to say the movie was *bad*. I would probably use the word *contrived*. This movie contains just about everything that a rational human being should be repulsed by:-> a cheesy soundtrack that lingers *to this day* on radio stations everywhere.-> a mass of Titanic zombies who keep talking and talking and talking about the movie.-> an embellished and trite ""historical"" plot based on ""real"" events.There is absolutely no way that this movie should have taken up 3 hours of your time, save the fact that it was so expensive they probably didn't want to waste one inch of film.  I guess they figured since you already know the ending, they'd string you along with overdone, poorboy-richgirl cliches and special effects.  Yeah, the effects *were* great (I certainly couldn't do them); I'm just praying for the day when it's finlly passe to even talk about special effects.Consider that DreamWorks, the company stemming from the little project know as the Star Wars Trilogy, had to invent special effects, invent the tools to invent the special effects, and had virtually no prior model to base any of their work (or at least techniques) on.  Today it's all old hat; who can write programs that render graphics quickly; who is the resident software expert; who can do the most in the least amount of time.

Didn't sink fast enough,"""Look Fabrizio, look dolphins. And one of them has jumped out of the water"".At long last I watched this film with trepidation after hearing so many good things. It started off impressively enough but when I saw the dolphins scene I thought 'oh no, here we go - welcome to cliche world'.However, putting aside a fairly ordinary love story this film had some good acting, impressive periodic detail and superb special effects. Unfortunately, I had to use the fast forward button on my remote after the first third of the film because I knew exactly what was going to happen in the middle (as with any other bog standard 'rich girl meets poor boy' love story). I couldn't wait to see how the ship was going to rest in its eternal bed under the sea.And I wasn't disappointed. I could feel the agony of those poor people trying desperately to cling on to life. I almost cried when those b*****ds in the life boats didn't return to rescue the people in the water. And the special effects rated as the best I've seen in 1998 (remember I've only just seen it).Conclusion: I gave it an eight out of ten for special effects but took away two points for going on a wee bit too long with an uninvolving love story. I don't rate this movie as one of my favourites but wasn't disappointed after watching it (as I usually am with many cliche'd movies). Definitely one to see.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Not bad but could've been better,"On a metal table in the Virginian Pilot (a newspaper) distribution wharehouse at 3:30 AM, I saw my my first glimpse of what would become the best remembered film of 1997. The paper was running an article that April morning on what it's like to die by hypothermia and had a pic. from the film on the cover. Whether ""L.A. Confidential"" should've won best picture is a good question... All I knew was, I'd never seen any film that got so much hype in the months that followed.You all know the plot. You know the ship sinks. But this movie isn't as bad as some say, because while it does contain the most silly and overused love story imaginable, traces of sincerity can be found everywhere. James Cameron really DID care about the Titanic sinking. It shows because the film does decently give the viewer a sense of whats going on. That's incredibly important because the subject matter is so terribly serious (1 THOUSAND 5 HUNDRED Peoples' lives ending). I'd have liked it better if the film had been solely on the sinking and not even but mentioned Jack and Rose, but I'll take what I can get. Finally a year later a film came out that's sole purpose was to be historically accurate. It wasn't perfect, but at least ""Saving Private Ryan"" didn't ask me to cry for anyone's death's there was no celine dion song playing through the credits and James Ryan didn't end the film by leaving a medal or something at the grave site. It (SPR) put out there what it wanted to say and let me come up with the rest. Had Titanic been that same kind of film, I might own a copy of it now. Instead I rent it every other year or so.

An incredibly beautiful movie that holds up on every watch,"There are many who say Titanic is ""overrated"", ""over-hyped"" or some might inexplicably go as far to say ""boring"" and ""pointless"". The hardly arguable biggest blockbuster of the 90s, grossing near 2 billion at the box office and winning 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture, has attained some hate from people over the years, people who love to hate this movie for everything they so wrongly think it is not and never will be. It has, however, attained a very positive social status among a lot of people whom their hearts were captured by this masterpiece. Those people can see just how magnificent of a movie this really is, and how underrated a classic it appears to be in today's film society; a dazzling and striking accomplishment in itself and never overlooked, but unfairly maligned by many.The movie, aside from being set on the Titanic and called Titanic, actually has a love story that renders up most of the movie time, as most would already know. This love story, is positively brilliant in every sense of the word. I am always amazed and captivated to watch it play out on screen, because Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, who were furiously snubbed out of Best Actor/Actress awards, have wonderful chemistry, giving me chills in lots of scenes, and they both separately give incredulous performances that enthrall and charm every step of the way as well. These two characters' strong likability, along with James Cameron's directing and the entirely fascinating special effects make this movie something much more than mere entertainment. The movie is excellently executed in the best manner it could be, the Bill Paxton and Gloria Stuart present day story being very interesting as well, and a lot of the film's aspects are quite simply riveting and awe-inspiring whether it's the love story, the intensity in all the performances or the infamous, brilliantly portrayed sinking and sets that give true heart to the story of the Titanic and shows it's revelation quite undeniably like any other film on the subject.While ""My Heart Will Go On"", receiving the Academy Award for Best Original Song, has attained some criticism from people as well, it makes the perfect score and theme song for every scene it is used in regarding the movie, especially the climax, which has had millions in tears, had me in tears, and always has me in tears when I watch it, even if it is not the saddest movie of all time, because it isn't. It's a film about love, a film about disaster, a film about memories, and it is beautifully shown how all of those three attributes tie into peoples' lives, but I am not melancholy, I am merely pleased with how stunning of a film it is, and how remarkably well it has held up over the years, not being overthrown by any blockbusters in recent years in likes of quality, in my honest opinion. James Cameron, even if not one of my favorite directors, is very talented and it shows with this movie. I do not understand a lot of the reasons why so many hate this, or do not find it as remarkable of a film as fans like me do, but I ensure you, this movie will always have a place in my heart, and will go down as a classic, already has even and will contine to whether haters like it or not, because of how many people were touched by it and are still touched by it.

"Not worthy of eleven Oscars, but still...","Although ""Titanic"" was praised as one of the greatest movies of all time, it was also the costliest, which may have accounted for the eleven Oscars it received in 1998.

Additionally, the love story was not very gripping.

It is pretty good - mostly because the last 90 minutes or so are fantastic cinema - but it's not particularly well-written or well-acted. The dialogue is often cringe-worthy, and the acting is not that impressive, though that could be due to the dialogue more than the actors. The story is simple enough, but carried out pretty well, and the look of the film is outstanding. All the technical aspects are top-notch, making for a thrilling last half. The first half is no slouch either, though, and I felt the film transitioned nicely from love story to disaster epic. All in all, an entertaining but slightly underwhelming epic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
#1 Film of All Time 🐐,"There will perhaps never be a film ever made again that is as enthralling, enchanting, and capturing as this one. We are delivered a unique combination of a poor charming artist, a rich engaged beauty, one of the most historic disaster events, one of the most impressive man made structures, a director known for action sequences and achieved cinematic violence, a digitally-generated achievement far before its time, and a cast of characters that roll off the screen like something out of a time capsule. The cinematography and screenplay is a large cherry atop a massive romance epic I will undoubtedly put as my favorite and #1 film of all time. Cameron delivers one for the ages, and displays how meticulous and detailed, yet simple a great American film should be made. This film should be replayed in cinema classes for generations to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
An Epic Tragedy.,"This is an epic tragedy movie about aristocrat Rose DeWitt Bukater falling in love with poor artist Jack Dawson, aboard the doomed Titanic. It is a beautiful but typical love story that captures the audience's hearts, providing a compelling subplot among the more tragic main story of the ill-fated voyage.Many of the movie's element was directed with excellence: the actors provided a solid and believable performance; the cinematography was beautiful; the music score was moving; and the sceneries and settings aboard the ship, amidst the flashy and famed lifestyles of aristocracy and amidst the poor but carefree lives of the townspeople and artists, were brilliant.The scenes of each character's fate after the Titanic started sinking is extremely powerful, haunting, and sometimes disturbing. The film quickly shifts from an emotional love story, which I thought was, unfortunately, pretty boring, to a heart-wrenching tragedy that cannot help but send chills down your spine (where most of the action lies).This movie is a little on the long side though, with several filler scenes that drag away from the main plot. Some sequences of Jack and Rose were pretty cliché - reminding you too much of a teenage-bop love story. While I am not a big drama fan, this movie is a good exception for pure, dramatic entertainment, but not one I would watch over and over again.Grade C",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Average,"I admit I enjoyed this film.  The grandeur of it all was impressive.  The fact that James Cameron let this film get to a 200 million dollar budget is also very impressive.  However, once the grandeur is taken away there really isn't much left.  The plot is a simple romance.  And since the story is so predictable, it puts some heavy pressure on a three hour film.The direction is superb.  My distaste for this film doesn't extend to James Cameron's technical direction.  His technical direction is on par with Spielberg's.  However, his human/emotional part of that mix doesn't rate very well.  The acting also is not consistent.  I didn't find DiCaprio's performance bad, but his character seemed to be very easy to play and wasn't that complicated.  Winslet, who's performance in Heavenly Creatures stunned me, is mainly okay here.  The best performances belonged to Gloria Stuart and Kathy Bates.The score also rates with the best, and the soundtrack is one I highly recommend.In the end, I think this film is more comparable to ""Cleopatra"" than to ""Gone With Wind"".  The budget and the problems making the film end up being more interesting and more entertaining than the film itself.Did this film deserve best picture? No.  But it's nomination was also like ""Cleopatra's"" nomination.  The big budget and the absolute vastness of the film was enough.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"Not great, but good","I just finished watching this on TV. It's easy to see why this movie was initially overhyped and overrated, then trashed as nothing more than a pre-teen chick flick. In truth, it's a lot like ""Dances with Wolves"", a big screen three hour plus epic that grabbed a fistful of Oscars, then p***ed everyone off by beating out what many thought was a superior film (for ""Titanic"" it was ""LA Confidential"", for ""Wolves"" it was ""Goodfellas""). I don't know if it was Oscar material, but it was definitely better than the critics now claim. On the plus side, no expense was spared in getting every detail visually perfect. I don't know how he did it, but James Cameron managed to thoroughly convince his audience that it was the real Titanic we were seeing. And the sinking scenes were amazingly real, enough to grab the heart of the most jaded movie goer. On the minus side, far too much time was spent on the fictional romance between Jack and Rose. The story of the Titanic itself contains so much drama that wasting two hours on this love affair was simply not needed. In short, this could have been THE film of the 1990's, instead it ended up as a good, but not great, money-making blockbuster.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"A beautiful film, with a stunning end.","Well Titanic was one of the films that made reviewers go crazy. I didn't really read any review that said it was awful, but now that is all people say. When it came out in 1997 everyone was talking about this film, it brought them to tears, the end scene shocked them, the love story made them feel warm. Now whenever anyone talks Titanic it is one of the worst films they've seen. Did I watch a completely different film, the acting was good, the computer generated images were amazing, the attention to detail was overwhelming. The script is the only thing that lets it down and there are worse out there. I found the whole thing to be very moving and if it was such a bad script it would make you cringe not cry.The people who call Titanic the worst film, obviously cried and are covering up for the fact it was one of the only films they cried at.I personally really like Titanic I think it's a very watchable experience that does leave you stunned if not tear stained.

"thank god they all die, mostly","The featured review of this film carries the line ""the scene shifts to Southampton, Ireland where the Titanic set sail from on April 10, 1912"" A minor point perhaps, to our american friends but Southampton is in England. Still, i only partly put that glaring error down to the unfortunate american who wrote it. After seeing Titanic i would have got the impression Southampton is in Ireland too. The ship was built in Belfast which was British then and is British now, so to make up for that and appease the Irish American audience they fill the ship with poor unfortunates from the emerald isle whose only role in the film seems to be getting screwed by the English ""tyrants"" who run the ship. Add a few poor but heroic Americans to the mix and you've got a blockbuster.

Performances, I must admit, are quite impressing. Billy Zane and Kathy Bates delivers a stand-out performances. Leonardo and Kate, also did well on this film, but truly neither of them deserves an Oscar. James Cameron, as far directing is concern, really deserves his Oscar.

I think Cameron's interest in the history of the ship is what carries this movie.  His affection for this event is seen in every detail of the movie.  For me I found myself cheering for Leo and Kate to die ,so I didn't have to sit through more of there banter.  Which is the main focus of the movie so , I rather became disinterested fast.

Great movie but I've seen better.,"Epic adventure film. The story of the Titanic tragedy might have been told in a better way ( A Night to Remember ) but it has never been and never will be told in a bigger way. A huge amount of money was spent and unlike some other films ( Waterworld ) it showed. Leonardo and Kathy Bates are excellent while the others give pretty good performances. The climax is probably the best in Hollywood history and the sets are also fantastic. Having said that , the movie is certainly not the best of all times and I doubt that it deserved the 11 Oscars. Kate certainly didn't deserve to be nominated. The movie swept away the whole world and probably the academy members also got a little carried away.

Mostly because of the cast, movie props & the true story behind it. Making a part 2 of this movie??? I don't know. There is but it's a budget type movie. You know, they just don't make them how they used to. Especially like the old school movies now and days try to make it look authentic. It's just not good/ believable. Maybe if they used the same cast with a different twist. Perhaps a rich ''famous'' boxer as the main character. Leonardo as the experienced trainer. Rose's granddaughter same age as the famous boxer... A modern boxer though. A good guy. Not a boxer who's usually the villain if you catch my drift. By destiny they meet up... and occurs Celine Dion's My Heart Will Go On. Occurs..Overall a beautiful movie to watch with the family or a love one.

Very possibly the greatest film ever made...,"...WELL, maybe that's a slight stretch - but hey, I'm sure there were (and are) numerous good reasons for this movie's unprecedented success, like mainly: the invincible combination of two ""hot"" young actors; an established action/adventure director; a bloated budget that nevertheless served to show off some seriously cutting-edge sets, costumes, effects, etc; a classic love story set against one of the most tragic backdrops in early-twentieth-century history; and, of course, leading from all aforementioned reasons, the sheer curiosity from countless critics and moviegoers alike, to see just exactly what all the hype was about - which obviously paid off, making it the highest-grossing film worldwide (still! After nearly a decade!), and one of three tied record holders for the most Oscars won by a film.Yes, I understand that box-office status does not necessarily reflect quality (though I think recent failed releases like ""Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo"" prove otherwise); however, I'm of the opinion that maybe - just maybe - the massive mainstream viewing public got it right one time.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Good Movie,"First of all I want to express how impressed I am at how intelligent so many of the comments here have been. It kind of surprised me, because I figured the average person who loved or hated the movie Titanic would be at least a little bit on the dull side. We are talking about people who, in my opinion, got so carried away with the romance that they completely over-rated the film, or people who I thought were going to blast the film for stupid and superficial reasons. I was wrong. The comments here have been fantastic.This was a good movie, but it is not one of my favorites of all time. It is a very beautiful film at first, and obviously becomes ugly when we slowly watch the brutal disaster get worse and worse. We know that the ship sinks, we know that many people died, and we know that it was a long time ago, but Cameron succeeds in bringing new and intense emotions out of us anyway.While Titanic has hard work, precision, and passion, it does lack some real intelligent writing. Much of this movie is like a high quality soap opera filled with chatter and non-verbal language that left me bored several times.Still I thought the romance, special effects, music, and acting were all good enough for me to enjoy the Titanic, and will probably watch it several times.I have seen several people here change their minds about Titanic, when their original opinion was way on one side or the other of the spectrum.

Cameron masterfully balances moments of levity and tenderness,"Titanic"" is a visual spectacle that showcases James Cameron's mastery of filmmaking. The attention to detail in recreating the ship is truly remarkable, immersing viewers in the lavishness of the first-class accommodations and the stark contrast with the cramped conditions of the lower decks. The cinematography captures the grand scale of the vessel, from the awe-inspiring shots of the ship sailing across the vast ocean to the tense and heart-wrenching moments as it meets its tragic fate.The performances in ""Titanic"" are exceptional, with Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio delivering powerful and heartfelt portrayals of their characters. Winslet brings depth and complexity to Rose, portraying her as a young woman torn between societal expectations and her desire for true love and freedom. DiCaprio's Jack exudes charm, warmth, and an infectious joie de vivre that perfectly complements Rose's character. The chemistry between the two leads is palpable and adds an extra layer of authenticity to their on-screen romance.The film takes viewers on a rollercoaster of feelings, from the exhilaration of young love and the joyous moments of freedom aboard the ship to the heart-wrenching tragedy that unfolds during its fateful encounter with an iceberg. Cameron masterfully balances moments of levity and tenderness with scenes of intense drama and despair, making the emotional impact all the more profound.In addition to its compelling narrative and stunning visuals, ""Titanic"" also boasts a memorable and haunting musical score composed by James Horner. The iconic theme song, ""My Heart Will Go On"" performed by Celine Dion, became synonymous with the film and further elevated its impact on popular culture.If there's one criticism to be made about ""Titanic,"" it's that the film's runtime of over three hours may be a bit daunting for some viewers. However, the story is so engrossing, and the pacing so well-crafted, that it rarely feels like a burden.In conclusion, ""Titanic"" is a cinematic masterpiece that continues to resonate with audiences worldwide. It combines a poignant love story with breathtaking visuals and a profound exploration of human resilience and the fragility of life. James Cameron's direction, coupled with outstanding performances and a captivating soundtrack, cements the film's place in the annals of cinema history. Whether you're a fan of romance, drama, or historical films, ""Titanic"" is a must-watch that will leave an indelible mark on your cinematic journey.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
An apotheosis of cheese,"I am not as much offended by this movie because of its historical inaccuracy. It is true that for all the hype about how the china, carpeting and furniture reproduced exactly those of the Titanic, and how the ship sunk exactly in the way described by the movie, and so on, the plot is entirely fictitious and proud of it. In itself that is not bad, what's bad is how cheesy and cliché this plot is, and that this cheesy, cliché and invented story occupies 90% of the movie's attention, with the sinking of the ship treated as something on the side. The only important people are the main couple, Jack and Rose, her fiancé and her mother. The remaining characters are treated with a disinterest that borders on disrespect. We only get to know that the third-class passengers are fun-loving and warm, and those in first-class are stuffy, snobbish and exceedingly preoccupied with dinner cutlery. Wow, isn't that new! The whole thing is so fake, it was really difficult to get minimally interested.This movie is the triumph of Hollywood's latest formula, followed also by `Armageddon' and `Pearl Harbor': some action for the boys, romance for the girls, everybody happy (though from the comments I've read here from boyfriends dragged kicking and screaming to see it, maybe I'm wrong about everybody being happy). In the case of Titanic it worked: Leo's fans went to see the movie over and over again, sending its box-office gains into the stratosphere. Truth to tell, it is too much to ask of a megazillion-budget movie like this to be anything but cliché: it just had to be meretriciously agreeable for the largest possible number of people, so anything adventurous, minimally controversial or profound was out of the question.But, as I said, so many people liked it, so, what do I know? However, if you are interested in seeing something really related to the Titanic, watch the British movie `A Night to Remember.' The special effects are not so cool, and it is in black and white, but it is far more accurate and infinitely more dignified.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Why this movie is overrated,"This movie illustrates very effectively what is wrong with most of major American cinema in the past 15-20 years. It can be summed up this way: It is the triumph of spectacle or style over substance. Way, way, way too often, Hollywood relies on special effects, attractive actors and flashy clothes and explosions. It's not that Titanic is a bad movie by any stretch, but it's certainly not a great movie either. The primary flaw is in Director James Cameron's attempt to write the script. I agree with most of the critics I've read that Cameron has a great eye but a somewhat defective ear. The characters are clichéd, poorly written and in many cases the acting is quite sub-par. All of this goes unnoticed by most people of course because of the fact that most Americans don't read enough to know what good, realistic well-written dialog sounds like (not to mention the fact that character development is all but completely overlooked by most major studios these days so most people aren't routinely exposed to truly well-developed interesting characters). All this adds up to the fact that Titanic, while an entertaining and well-done picture, hardly qualifies as the best movie made in 1997 and definitely not one of the best ever as so many people would care to assert. I think that the provider of the overly praise-laden commentary displayed on IMDb for this movie should A) graduate from high school and remember that people who don't think this movie is superb are actually in the minority and B) watch a few more, older movies, particularly those made with great scripts--like The Godfather, Chinatown, The Usual Suspects, Casablanca, any Tarantino or Hitchcock movie--and those with some great actors--like Cary Grant, Kate Hepburn, Laurence Olivier, Ed Norton, Cate Blanchett, Jimmy Stewart, Daniel Day Lewis and Angelica Huston. Let's stop relying on the box office and the lame Academy of Motion Pictures (who somehow felt that Braveheart, Shakespeare in Love and yes, Julia Roberts deserved Oscars) to tell us what is a quality product.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

It is an epic love story which happens to be set upon the Titanic, that is all-and there is nothing wrong with that. There are some good performances and room in the story for some engaging character development. There are also great special effects and plenty of action scenes, to keep your pulse up.

I mean, who is the villain here if a poor try-hard gambling artist who seduces rich women and goes into a rich man's car and makes it dirty and makes her think not to marry the man she truly loves and wanted to get married with? That's either a very sick surfer-dude or ONE, DUMB woman. When he dies, he only makes it worse for Kate and basically ruins her life. She has no mother, no husband and no life anymore. It was that S.O.B. who made her live with her daughter in a haystack cabin 80 years later, if DiCrapio wasn't there she would have died happily rich and loved by her family.Yes, James Cameron did a good job wasting his time here, he did probably deserve Responsible for the Biggest Mistake Ever, but he did much better in T2, The Abyss, Aliens and True Lies. Those films actually entertained me. And, Jim, you're NOT the king of the world.The script was wonderful. Glorious is all I can say.""I'll never let go Jack, I'll never let go..."" (Rose lets go of Jack) -audience cries. oh jack. oh jack-""Do you love him?"" ""Pardon me"" ""Do you love him?"" ""None of your business!"" ""It's a simple question."" (Jack stares at Rose very angrily) -audience holds each other's hands, anxiously waiting for an answer-Touching..All in all, Titanic is one overrated pile of nothing which DOES NOT DESERVE its acclaim i'm telling ya.

Horrible movie.,"zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.  Need I say more?  I watched this movie on video.  Everyone said it was so great. DiCaprio should be ashamed.  His acting was boring, his character sucked, and his personality was tired.  I sat for the first 45 minutes of the movie and struggled to find something interesting.  After the first 45 minutes, I got up and did some cleaning, came back about an hour later, and didn't notice I missed a thing.  The only thing positive about this movie is that I found out how much cleaning you can get done when you are totally bored. -14 out of 10 stars.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Extremely overrated,"In a bygone era, James Cameron's ""Titanic"" would be considered cinematic filler not worthy of being eligible for consideration among the greatest in the medium. However, in 1997, the packaging of a stale love story around expensive special effects was more than enough to garner this film an undeserving rout at the Academy Awards in March of 1998.The film's main strength is the recreation of the actual sinking of the ship. The cinematography and effects for doing that were first rate. However, all of that is undone by the story and moreover, the questionable selection of the lead actors, especially in the case of Leonardo Di Caprio.In summary, 'Titanic' is essentially a chick flick with some special effects thrown in to convince guys otherwise. That may have worked in 1997, but four years later, sorry.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
My all time favorite movie,"I have seen the movie so many times that i remember the dialouges now. And every-time i see i feel like there is something new to it. It is the most amazing, wonderful movie i have ever seen. James Cameroon could not have got better actors than Leonardo and Kate Winslet to this movie. I have fallen in love with Jack since the first time i saw this movie. Never really occurred i could write a review about it, but today when i am watching it again and had my laptop just next to me thought of opening my heart. The music, gosh i have never loved background score of any movie as much i love Titanic's. The band that plays when ship is sinking, the song my heart will go on- well nothing needs to be said about that. I have been fantasizing this kind of love and romance ever since i saw this movie. It is one grand movie ever made, you cannot not like even a single part of this one. I really want Titanic to have a sequel in which Jack would come alive somehow with some logic or something. This movie took my heart away, its astoundingly beautiful and mesmerizing. Jack Dawson is my love and Titanic will remain my favorite movie ever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Timeless Magnificence,"It's been a long time since I last watched Titanic. I remembered some questionable dialogues and scenes from the last time I watched but what I had missed was something I had forgotten. The true essence of Titanic. The unending love for the story told in a way it was told. For another eight years, I was ignorant to it.
I recently saw a clip of Titanic which got me pumped to watch it again. I started watching with my brother who never liked Titanic for reasons I couldn't understand.
This time, not only did I remember what I missed, I felt the love with which it was made. Such magnificence. The story, style, chemistry of the actors and the characters being played, direction, score. Everything blended together to show why Titanic was ever popular! By the end of it, I was almost in tears with even the one watching with me praising it. And I finally witnessed what I was missing... Titanic. The way the story is told to eventually end on a note which would bring anyone to tears. It's perfection and to describe my experience in words in really difficult. I was enchanted, happy, sad and whatnot!
This is a timeless masterpiece and will continue to be for all times to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Better than average, not as good as it's box office take.","It seems like nobody thinks this movie is good. It's either ""this is the greatest movie that ever was or ever will be made"" or it's ""you mean somebody actually paid real money to make this trash."" To me it's a decent movie. The love story leading us all through it is hokey and it's far too long, but it is captivating. Winslet was decent, Leo was marginal, and Zane was way over the top - could any real person actually be that annoying? The effects were mostly good and occasionally stunning. Overall, it wasn't a bad flick. Had Cameron put half the effort into the romance story and the characters that he put into the effects it might have earned it's 11 Oscars. On the other hand, you have to hand it to him for being smart enough to know that there are millions of women out there that'll drag their boyfriends and husbands out over and over to see the charming and handsome DiCaprio drown for the love of a woman (and husbands and boyfriends that are secretly not complaining about having another look at Winslet or the cool FX).",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Just plain wrong in so many ways,"I am one of the few people, I think, that has not seen all of Titanic. I saw most of it, and couldn't sit through the rest.You see, I have a great interest in the *real* Titanic. And I truly believe that this three-hour 'epic' is the greatest insult to the tragedy ever to be put on film. It has nothing to do with the ship, or what really happened. The story would have been more realistic set in some city! As it is the ship is just pushed into the background of a love story that could never, and I repeat never, have happened in true life. Rose would never even have met Jack, and most likely she would not have wanted to! Steerage passengers on the Titanic, and all other ocean liners of the time, were strictly prohibited from association with the other classes, and first class held themselves so aloof that they did not even look on second class, let alone steerage, as human beings let alone material for lovers. Rose would have been raised with these attitudes; they would have been engraved in her no matter how 'free-spirited' she was! And what are the chances that a noblewoman, who has likely never done a lick of work in her life, could ever swing an axe without chopping off someone's hand? Nil.This movie is nothing but Hollywood capitalising on a tragedy that cost hundreds of lives. The only really fitting tribute to the doomed liner is Titanic the musical, which has done it's research and is a triumphant tribute to the ship and the world she sailed in, in which the characters become secondary and the doomed liner takes on a life of it's own.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
GOAT,"How is this not in the top 250? This movie was breathtaking and inspiring. My new favorite! The love story goes deeper in meaning than any other. In some ways this movie is also a tribute to the power of memory and means so much more than is seen on the surfce. The cast was well picked, I cannot think of any actor or actress who would have played the roles better. James Cameron did an impecible job of being detail oriented when it came to the true events that took place in 1912. Additionally, the movie was so well done that while watching, it feels as though you are transported to the actual event. MASTERPIECE",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Undeniably Brilliant and Iconic,"Is it one of my favorite movies? No. Is it one of the greatest movies Hollywood ever made? Yes. Titanic is objectively one of the greatest movies of all time, and it's undeniable.What works against it are the incredibly long runtime of over 3 hours, which can dredge along on rewatches at the beginning, and the fact that it's a Romance movie, which will likely turn off many male viewers who prefer action, thrillers, and some dramas. So while it's among the best movies of all time, it does have drawbacks for certain audiences.Titanic excels best in the third and final act, the last hour or so, when they strike the iceberg and just before that as the romance heats up more. There it evolves into an action-packed, heart racing thriller with lots of moving parts. Beyond the unforgettable and realistic spectacle of the sinking ship (which amazingly makes you feel like you are right there), there is still plenty of story left to be told, and no matter how strong you think you are, this movie will pull at even the most stoic person's heartstrings, quite a tearjerker for most people.It's a true epic. Director Cameron's ambition (the most expensive movie ever made at the time over 200 million in 1997) and commitment to consistency and quality being quite the ""movie"" experience, Kate Winslet's unforgettable lead performance as Rose (how did she not win the Oscar?; she should have), and the emotional components set in front of the background of one of the most infamous disasters of the 20th century, all factor into making Titanic one of the most groundbreaking and iconic love story movies of all-time.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Exceptional,"The tale of the ill-fated, unsinkable, R.M.S. Titanic is a tale we all know too well, but could not have been illustrated more beautifully.

The two of the strongest performances ever given by DiCaprio and Winslet, that it still remains unforgettable almost 25 years later.

Way too melodramatic,"This is the best of the sappy melodramatic films to come out in the past years, but it is still not that great of a movie. I cannot stand Billy Zane's character. He is such a stereotypical rich guy, it makes me sick. No this is not a bad movie, but it is not great and did not deserve the academy award over LA Confidential, but that is not why I am giving it 6 out of 10. I think this movie lost a point just by making it seem like it was Rose/Jacks fault that the Titanic sunk, remember when the watch guards are not doing their job and watching Jack and Rose make out instead of looking for icebergs, they make it seem like they were partially responsible for it.

A stunning example of the idiocy of The Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences.,"When I saw ""Titanic,"" I thought it was vaguely entertaining, and the costumes and special effects were beautiful. However, I didn't leave the theatre discussing it with my friends, and I didn't feel or think any differently than three and a half hours earlier. Then I heard it had been nominated for numerous Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and I was outraged.Not surprisingly, this big-budget piece of recycled Hollywood trash won, even against three of its wonderful competitors, ""L.A. Confidential,"" ""As Good as it Gets,"" and ""Good Will Hunting."" The first has plenty of interesting plot twists and amazing performances, the second gives a fresh and cynically humorous look at romance, and the third helped ME realize some things about myself, at least.  ""Titanic"" did nothing like that.The screenplay was something that had been done dozens and dozens of times before, and as far back as the Elizabethan era, as the ludicrous, 'Romeo & Juliet'-esque romance will prove. The performances, even by such normally-wonderful actors as Kathy Bates, Billy Zane, and Kate Winslet were either dry, or over-done. I imagine that if one had to 'listen' to this movie  rather than have the dialogue and music (which is pretty at parts, but just a repeat of many of Horner's other scores) accompany the pretty images, it would be completely unbearable.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

A true cinematic epic.,"A film of such incredible proportions is a rarity in cinema. 'Titanic,' was recently re-released on Blu-Ray, and I took the opportunity to watch the film for the first time in over a decade. I was 8 years old when I last saw this film, something which probably contributed to my opinion that the film was over-long, soppy and incredibly dull. How wrong I was.'Titanic,' is epic cinema at its finest. So many aspects of the film are truly wonderful, the scale, the performances and the design to name a few. James Cameron has repeatedly cemented himself as one of the most talented directors in Hollywood, managing to craft gargantuan products with colossal budgets and still maintain a wonderful human emotion to his works. Though the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 serves as the basis for this film, the true meat of it is a love story between two young people from polar opposite ends of society; Jack Dawson, played by a boyish Leonardo DiCaprio, a lower class drifter with a gift for art, and Rose, a higher class young woman trapped in the confines of a loveless engagement, portrayed by a fresh-faced Kate Winslet. Over the course of 3 hours and 14 minutes their love story plays out among the hundreds of stories of that fateful voyage that tragically killed so many.The true wonder of 'Titanic,' is its sheer scale. The film was originally released in 1997, yet the production dwarfs that of most large scale films of today's Hollywood. The costume design and set production is absolutely staggering, truly worthy of the Oscars the design and production won. The special effects are also worth praising, especially considering that the film is now 15 years old. However, with the transition to Blu-Ray, and the clarity that the image receives because of the transfer, some of the effects are unfortunately rather obvious, though this does nothing to detract from the overall experience. The sound design is also excellent, particular praise reserved for the score. There is an almost Enya-like quality to the score, gentle and mellow yet rousing in all the correct places.The performances are all excellent. DiCaprio and Winslet both carry the production on their young shoulders, and do so with aplomb. Their chemistry is impressive, and both actors are pleasant and likable. Billy Zane, as Rose's arrogant fiancé, is suitably horrid and despicable, and Zane gives probably the best performance of his career. All roles are performed well, including Kathy Bates as a 'new-money,' socialite and Bernard Hill as the captain of the doomed voyage.There are so many moments from this film that are frequently quoted and fondly remembered, and there's a reason. 'Titanic,' is an incredible experience, and well worth picking up on Blu-Ray. I'm certainly glad I did.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Sweeping epic!,"James Cameron's blockbuster Titanic is timeless, moving, and a real visual splendor (though they could brush up on one or two CGI scenes). The attention to detail is stunning and breathtaking. It is perfectly written and perfectly cast - particularly with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as Jack and Rose. They both are extremely talented, top-notch actors.
You don't even notice how long it goes for. It grabs you and sucks you in. But it is also sad and a bit depressing knowing what will happen at the end. I haven't cried at a movie in a long time, so was surprised to find myself crying at this movie. I can relate in some respects to Rose and I really like the message about enjoying life.

This Movie Deserved Every Oscar It Got,"For the people on here who commented that Titanic was the ""worst movie they've ever seen,"" apparently they haven't seen ""Showgirls"" or anything with Anna Nicole SMith. Give me a break guys. James Cameron did a phenomenal job with this movie; it truly brought the Titanic disaster back to life. Mr. Cameron did hundreds of hours (if not thousands) of research on the Titanic, including getting the poignant footage under water of the ship. A lot of facts and history with the Titanic disaster was incorporated into this movie,, giving us all the more reason to love it. Though it was over 3 hours long, I was not bored for one minute and that's very unusual for me to be able to sit through a movie this long. I was captivated by the love story and suspense Mr. Cameron created. The theme song "" My Heart Will Go On"" was perfect for the movie but it was terribly over played on the radio stations during this time. The ending was magnificent and I think everyone in the theatre cried, knowing that almost 2,000 people perished in the end. Yes, there were a couple of corny lines in the movie but no movie is perfect. I think the special effects used while the ship was sinking and the passengers were loading up in the boats, was extremely realistic and just moving. The replica ship used was also incredible. I think both Kate Winslet and Leonardo DeCaprio were fantastic in the lead, though I think Ms. Winslet was a little miscast since she looks a lot older than Leo. I have seen this movie several times and still watch it when it's on television. I do not think any other Titanic movie is superior to this one. **** 1/2 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"""Life's a gift""","It's sometimes difficult to assess a movie that was such a phenomenon in its day. Titanic was a gigantic hit upon release, talked about everywhere, unavoidable. In parallel to its massive popularity there was also a backlash of people denouncing it as clichéd and overly sentimental, a lot of whom were probably deliberately disliking it because of its ubiquity. Now, it's of that awkward age where it's too recent to merit classic status, but too distant to still really be talked about much. As such its standing in posterity seems to be undecided, as yet.Historical romantic epics like this have long been around, and have long done well at box offices and awards ceremonies. And yes, they may be formulaic, but there is a certain craft in ticking all the boxes. Titanic works by bringing us in, with those opening scenes, with the position of a clinical observer of the wreck, as we might have seen it in books or documentaries. The framing narrative has a modern familiarity that we can relate to. We are then gradually eased back into the past, and the story of the ship and those who sailed aboard her becomes humanized. And I'm not just referring to the central love story. In writing his screenplay, James Cameron goes to lengths to pick hundreds of tiny strands, from the real fates of historical personages to brief flashes of unnamed figures. This broad, human retelling of a great disaster gives Titanic a wonderful richness, not to mention a deeper poignancy.Cameron was at this point best-known for his blockbusting actioners like Aliens and the Terminator movies, so as a director he might have seemed out of his depth on Titanic. But Cameron was always a professional, never a show-off, and he could handle weighty subjects with maturity. He doesn't faff about with the camera, usually keeping it still while all the movement is within the frame. And of course, when the movie turns more action-orientated during the ship's sinking, his experience puts him in good stead. The collision with the iceberg is so suspenseful that, every time I see it, I still hope the ship will turn in time. Throughout the movie there are a lot of point-of-view shots, more than most filmmakers dare to use these days, but the idea is to bring us close to the sensation of being there. But perhaps Cameron's greatest strength is his finding of an apt image to tell a story in an instant, from a man with his family frantically thumbing through a translation book to find his way off the ship, to Ismay's guilty face against the side of the ship as he is lowered down.The studio took a gamble in allowing Cameron to cast two lead players who were as young and inexperienced as Winslet and DiCaprio, but it paid off. Winslet is not a traditional beauty, but she has a vivacious personality that makes her attractive and instantly likable. At first glance DiCaprio seems to have been hired for his looks, but he proves to have a deep sincerity, such as the when he confronts Winslet and confesses his feelings towards her. And after all it's moments like this where a performance counts the most. But what really makes these two work is their believable youthfulness, and that eager rapport between them. Passionate love stories that take place over a day or two can easily seem a bit false, but Winslet and DiCaprio seem so great together the briefness of their affair is irrelevant.This diamond of a movie is not, I'll admit, without a few flaws. Despite the brilliant construction of the screenplay, the dialogue is woefully trite. The special effects are typically over-ambitious '90s CGI, with texture-less surfaces and too many fake people (although to be fair it still looks better than, say, a scale-model would). But whereas these problems would stick out like sore thumbs in a lesser picture, Titanic has such a grand sweep and emotional power that they become insignificant. I hope cinematic history will judge Titanic well, because regardless of hype and counter-hype, it really is everything a movie should be.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Excellent special affects,"Titanic is a good movie and has a touching love story of 2 young lovers (Leonardo Decaprio, Kate Winslet) aboard the doomed ship that sunk in 1912. One of the movies best aspects is the special affects and direction even though the love story drags on a little bit too long. Some of the acting had its ups and downs (Winslet and Billy Zane as  her rich fiancee are the best). The movie was too overhyped but still very good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Your heart will go on. We get it. Stop cluttering my screen!,"This movie is *pitiful.* It is *abominable*. In terms of dung heaps, it is second only to ""Superman Returns."" That's not a very honorable position.Why do I hate ""Titanic,"" you may be wondering? Here's a list. 1) Leonardo di Caprio's performance as the lovable but down-on-his-luck guy could have been played better and more realistically by Paris Hilton. 2) Kate Winslet's fake American accent is the least of the woes left by her whiny, I'm-a-poor-widdle-rich-girl turn. 3) James Cameron should automatically be disqualified as the director of any real historical tragedy, because he makes us care more about the prettiness of the ship than the victims. 4) Where James Horner's music fails to nauseate (he was really off his game here), you always have the classic fallback: Celine Dion's mess of a theme song.Those are the top four reasons-- I could write a 52-page essay on why this movie is so horrid, but IMDb doesn't provide reviewers with that kind of space, so I'll condense it a wee bit.If you want to watch a disaster, this film is perfect... and I'm referring to the debacle of the film, not the Titanic incident.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

My favorite movie,"The movie of Titanic came out in 1997. And then was an Oscar award winning. The director is James Cameron. And the actors is Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack and Kate Winslet as Rose. This movie is love story. The Titanic was a ship that sank in 1992. It reorganize show film. When play ""My heart will go on"" song that will impress the movie, and then the love feeling. 3 hours long time, and then my watching is very romantic every plots, what is follow next plot. For example, Rose was flying in ships beside, that audiences were touched my heart by this shot. And then the scenery of breaking dawn is beautiful and wonderful. Every girl want instead of Rose that is romantic plot. Second, the passengers confused around the ship after the Titan crashed iceberg, unless musicians played on ""Wedding Dance"" so quiet. The shot was satirized by this gimmick point.Discussing technology, the titanic used model ship, which have shoot really effect. The passengers fall down and slide on the floor after the titanic was sinking in the ocean. The technology is very amazing in 1997, that isn't easy play on video. So, the video is a big making that appreciate the director designing, and then the plot had a nervous environment.The movie is my favorite. Jack and Rose is excellent, and then bring me have a romantic feeling. It was complete the end from embark to accident, let's me watching Titanic event.

LA Confidential was the best film of 1997,"Some day there will be commission of people consisting of film critics, movie fans, and of people with good taste & intelligence.

It was bad enough that Titanic won anything at all but for it to be named Best Picture over LA Confidential (or any other good film that came out in 1997) is a crime against anyone who values well-acted, intelligent and well-crafted films.Titanic is basically an overblown soap opera featuring a man-boy hero (Leo DiCaprio), a cartoonish bad-guy (Zane), and an inaccurate portrayal of life in 1912 and of events that took place that terrible night.    Women in those days did not flip the bird.  No Titanic officers or crewmen killed anyone or committed suicide with a gun.What is worst is that Titanic is simply a banal film.  Yes, it has very impressive special effects and looks quite real but it's boring to sit through it a second or third viewing.  It has no more depth than an episode of BayWatch.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Clever Story LIne,"The movie was quite excellent, but I'm taking off a point due to some deficiencies that cause it to limp to port. The first is the beginning of the movie where we see the salvage ship and manned submersible. To me this was a bit of a yawn and took away from the story.The movie should have started with a professor Lovett lecturing maritime museum attendees about famous ship wreck and then come to the Titanic display. He could then describe the construction of the Titanic not letting on plans to find it. Then flashback to the planning and building of the ship and voyage back in the day. I would rather have seen the crew on board the salvage ship yakking it up while going over the ghostly camera views of the ship as it lies on the ocean floor.The movie theme song, which evoked Irish folk music, did not give the viewer any other connection to Ireland either. It's ghostly tone would have played well panning over the graveyards to give an appreciation of the victims.Another big problem was the older Rose who recounted the story on the salvage ship did not look 101 years old! She looked about 84 years old and would have been but a baby at the time of the Titanic. In no way would she have been able to be transported by helicopter to the salvage ship to tell the story. To me, this mistake sunk the movie at the outset because it is the old lady that gives one a sense of how long ago the ship sank. So if Rose was 16 years old at that time, this movie would have been appropriate for the year 1981, not 1997. In 1997, the older Rose should have been in a nursing home in a wheelchair and being help along to tell the story. At the very least the make-up artists should have aged the Rose character actress by 16 years to make her really look like a 101 on the ship. Notice the older Rose was far to alert and animated for someone that age. If you've lived to be 100 years old or older, you're talking much slower. All that said, it is interesting that the actress who play the older Rose, was actually 87 at the time of the movie and actually lived to be 100 in real life! Also, she was born in Santa Monica which Dawson mention in the movie regaling one of his adventures. The casting really was spot on in this movie, she just needed a little more time in the makeup room to look the part and should have talked slower and tired.Leo and Kate put in a good performance in the movie, and the cast was generally excellent, but to me Brad Pitt would have been a far more credible choice for Jack Dawson as a dashing, adventure-seeking lad. Frankly, Kate looked third class so I had more of a problem imaging her as upper class of that era. She certainly would not have been fetching enough for a Brad Pitt as Dawson. So for me that was a bit of an issue.The special effects may have been state of the art for 1997, but to me I never felt like I was on the ship. There was no mist spray in the face or rain falling on the deck. The set fan wind and cgi dolphins did not do it for me and I don't think they can survive in cold water just above freezing like Dawson described it. So the elements of nature were never really brought into the movie until the end. At that point it is too late to draw the viewer into the movie and the viewer is asked to believe all that happens then. In summary, the movie should have made sure the viewer was on the ship long before the sinking.There should also have been a little more character development of the famous people on the ship explaining how they boarded it other than just the fictional character portrayed by Leo.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
I liked it but now I don't.,"It's strange, I really liked this movie BEFORE Leonardo because famous.  Now that he's famous and hanging out at all the local hangouts in Hollywood and causing trouble, it's thwarted my opinion of his acting skills.  I will review this movie as if I saw it without knowing about Leo.  Ok, it was great.  I loved the scenes and the character portrayed by Billy Zane (who people say I look like) was perfectly evil.  I have seen lots of movies which involve love but this movie happened to really capture the intensity of love that exists between Kate Winslet and Leo.  I admit, the scene in the car was goofy.  But the scene in the dining room was splendid.  I hated the part where Leo screams that he's the king of the world.  Movies like this and Saving Private Ryan make us so much more interested in History.  I agree that this movie was good.  But heck, I just love history movies.  Three thumbs up!",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Meaningless drivel,"What a dog! A wonderful exercise by Hollywood in wrapping a tedious love story around an historical event in order to sell tickets. The two stars spend the whole of the film in breathless mode trying to inject some life into this corpse whilst we are ""treated"" to an occasional reference back to the Titanic disaster in order to gain some credibility. No cliché is left unturned in this film, from long lingering shots of the lovers to the wailing drone of the title song endlessly inserted when we are supposed to feel the helplessness of their love. When I saw this film, people actually cheered when the ship went down - we would have cheered more if it went down in the first five minutes.Meaningless fodder for the intellectually challenged.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"Not Bad, Not Bad At All","Ok ok ok... There is nothing wrong with Leo Di Caprio except that us guys wish we had his looks... His acting in Titanic was sub-par, but I've seen him do very excellent jobs in This Boy's Life and Romeo and Juliet, so I can't knock him for one average job. I've also seen Winslet do a better job, despite her Oscar nomination. James Cameron is a great special effects director, and I think some day people will look at him as one of the great influences of 1980's and 90's popular film. I enjoyed the film, although I did not LOVE it, but that's ok. The music was appropriate, if a little overdone, but the romance was great. No, I am not a fan of romance, but obviously for millions of girls out there it was VERY effective. Bravo to Cameron, and if it made more money than some of us think it deserved, well, that's showbusiness!",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
barely hanging onto life,"James Cameron, as is well known, stood firm not long after he finished work on this, his most audacious and confrontational film, yet even the most casual viewing of Titanic begs the question - had he not been lauded, would he have kept it real anyway? Every sequence, every shot and practically every moment of this film is so burdened with despair, barely concealed rage and a towering disgust with the human race, one gets the impression that Cameron was barely hanging onto life - and any attendant shreds of hope - by his fingernails. Although ostensibly an adaptation of one of Roger Hargreave’s most depraved works channeled through the horrifying excesses of the Oxford/Cambridge boat race with the Fascist ruling classes as its (authentically vile) villains, Titanic also contains a lot of contemporary criticism - Cameron hated the modern world, and explained the stomach-churning sink-age-isms as a none-too-subtle attack on the encroaching global domination of the fast food chains. (The scenes of sexual excess can similarly be read as a despairing attack on the permissive society - those who come to Titanic expecting titillation or B-movie sleaze will be sorely disappointed.) Beyond the nihilistic content, which has been well documented elsewhere, the film has an overall mood that seems to have been engineered to make the viewer thoroughly depressed. Shot on washed-out, faded film stock using primarily static cameras, long shots, choppy editing and very few cutaways, Titanic has a visual style reminiscent of cinema-verite documentary. Add to this the unnerving use of big band music, piano dirges and the (intentionally?) scrappy post-dubbed dialogue, and the distancing effect on the viewer is complete. Titanic comes across as one long primal scream of rage, designed to shake the viewer out of his complacency, and in this respect, the film succeeds unequivocally. Whether or not you would care to watch this more than once, or indeed for 'entertainment', is another matter, but Titanic is an important film that demands a careful viewing ONLY by those prepared for it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Iconic, but not flawless","A really solid film that throughout the years has become iconic. It really blands the disaster genre with romance extremely well. The soundstrack is very unique and I love the airy sound it has. It gives this film a strong nostalgic feeling.You can definitely tell its a cameron film, you will see both his strenghts and weaknesses in every aspect of the film. The film looks great and is technically superb. The runtime flies bye, and you dont notice the long runtime while watching.To me the film lacks however in the writing department. A lot of lines feel very hollywoodlike, in ways that no real person would really talk. Lines like ""smell ice right"" after getting hit by the iceberg take me out of the film more then they add. I also disliked how they seemingly needed to make a bad guy, and couldnt manage to balance that character. He has no real reason to want to be with Rose. He just says that she is going to be his wife, while looking miserable every second he is with her.Overall it's a real classic, and a really solid film. I totally get all the praise and criticism it got at the time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
An unsinkable ship goes down and kills a young love story,"Well, here we are four years later looking back at the phenomenon thatwas Titanic. I was in sixth grade when it was released, and I wassurrounded by hundreds of young girls seeing it seven times in a rowjust to get a long look at Leo. And this movie won best picture. Thetruth is that Leonardo DiCaprio is not a very good actor. He's no betterthan the other teenybopper actors out there like Freddie Prinze Jr. orRyan Phillipe. I mean look at the movie he made right after this, TheBeach.Back to the film itself. It's simply a love story that we've seencountless times, attached to a horrible tragedy. That's all. Why so manycritics and audiences fell for this is something I'll never understand.It was simply a one-hit wonder. Just about every single person I knowwho liked that movie back when it was in theaters barely even thinkabout it anymore. As for James Cameron, he's one of the most egotisticalpeople in Hollywood. When the guy shouted that he was the ""king of theworld"" at the Oscars, that's when I knew that he doesn't care a jotabout anything other than cash. Not to mention his appearance onSaturday Night Live when he lit his cigar with a burning hundred dollarbill. He takes a horrible tragedy, a film that could've lasted about twohours or so, and pastes in a formulaic, cliched love story to boost itup to 3:14.If you're one of the few people out there who still hasn't seen thisfilm, I say just skip the middle section and just go to the sinking ofthe ship. That is the only place where you will get any of the intensityand suspense that this film deserves.

"The first time I saw ""Titanic"" I loved it, but the other ones...","I've already seen ""Titanic"" four times. The first time I saw it I didn't pay attention at the mistakes, so I loved it and I would give it a 9 out of 10, or even 10. The second time I began to pay more attention, specially at Leonardo DiCaprio's acting. This time I saw with my mother and she didn't like it at all. I would give it a 8. The third time I saw at school and I found more mistakes- a 7. The fourth and last (I hope so)- a 6 out of 10. I think that's my final vote.There are a lot of good things and a lot of bad things about ""Titanic"". Kate Winslet is a great actress, the art direction, the costumes, the special effects... Oh! Perfect! However, James Cameron change the actors (except Kate Winslet) into dolls. We can see this in Billy Zane's and Leonardo DiCaprio's acting. And the script is so poor... You know... Cameron was thinking he was the king of the world when he did this film. And that's the result: ""Titanic"" is so-so.PS: I don't see anything special about the sound track. Well... I hate Celine Dion...",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A great film but not the film of the '90s,"""Titanic"" is one great film that never falters in length, talent or action but is not ever to be considered THE #1 film of the '90s. It may come as ONLY a close second behind ""Schindler's List"". Kate Winslet is a promising character actress but Leo DiCaprio is destined to play only contemporary parts well. His take on Romeo in ""William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet"" (1996) was very 90s despite the faithfulness to Will's original script and Jack in ""Titanic"" was very much the same. ""The Man in the Iron Mask"" was pretty much of a flop on his part also. Billy Zane, after playing dozens of supporting parts now has a chance of proving himself a good leading man (such as shown in tv's ""Cleopatra"" as Mark Antony last May). Gloria Stewart made a tremendous comeback after 45+ years with her portrayal of Old Rose but millions were shocked when she didn't win the Supporting Actress Oscar. Who did it go to? Miss Kim Basinger! Notorious for playing a prostitute in every movie she's made. Kathy Bates is a perfect choice to play the ""Unsinkable"" Molly Brown and Frances Fisher is a narrow-minded wretch of a woman as Rose's mother Ruth, one who only cared about herself and her position in society. Now for sheer spectacle and brilliant music, action and tension, ""Titanic"" may qualify as the best ACTION movie of the decade but not on a general ""all-in-all"" scale as a unique drama. ""Ben-Hur"" (1959) finally met it's match as the Oscar-winning champ when ""Titanic"" tied with it as the film with the highest number of Oscars (11 in all for both). And the ever-popular ""My Heart Will Go On"" by Celine Dion is probably the greatest song written for a film since ""Moon River"" of ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"". But let's not get carried away and glorify ""Titanic"" as the best film of the decade!",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

A powerful piece that deserves the recognition,"It's really only half a good film. But then again it's hard to make a romantic film that good anyway. James's Carmon's Titanic has obtained a place for itself in the history of film. Maybe because of it's huge box office success, or possibly it's utter domination at the 1998 Academy Awards, winning 11 categories including Best Picture. The film has been recognized for it's amazing cinematography and equally stunning visual effects, as well as immaculate sound editing, and an empowering musical score. It's quite an achievement and I have to give James Cameron grabs for it. And unlike most chick flicks Cameron actually has something to talk about rather than just a touchy love story. Like for example the concurrence of rich and poor, because in a disaster situation the amount of money you have in your pocket is not going to save you. There are many classical moments in this film to be remembered. There's three specific scenes that I'm not going to spoil for you that have an incredibly romantic yet tolerable essence to it, but mainly because Cameron delivered it in the very best way possible. The bottom line is that Titanic is a film to be remembered, we remember Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCapprio's wonderful on screen chemistry, Celine Dion's uplifting voice, and James Cameron's exceptional take on the most famous shipwreck ever. You can try and forget this chick flick like you would with any other, but you will not succeed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A 200 Million Dollar Flop,"As a Canadian,I should be cheering for the canadian director James Cameron. James, for sure is a better writer than a director. I have seen every James Cameron movie,and,at best,they are large budget B movies. What I find careless about this movie,is that it won as many oscars as William Wyler's BEN-HUR. Thatis an insult, and I'm quite sure willey is rolling in his grave.Titanic only redeeming factor is timing and,our morbid pre-occupation with disasters. This story has been told in many movies,which were better directed,with much lower budgets. Hell,with the budget Cameron had,Ed Wood Jr.could have done better,Roger Corman,the notorious cheapskate with that budget would have probably made it better.James, stick with ""Arnie"",and you may do a movie about governors!!!!!!!!!.

Horrifically overrated...,"It seems to me that 11 Oscars for this film is appalling. For some reason the nomination board have agreed that Titanic is one of the most revolutionary films ever made...Little seems to be asked of when watching this film, never really challenging the viewer, and ensuring that there is a distance kept between the film and the audience at all times. Whilst there are strong acting performances in it, Titanic seems to drag on with a short period of concentrated action and meaning.Could this be the most overrated film in history? It certainly seems that although winning 11 Oscars (only second my Lord of the Rings: Return of the King) Titanic doesn't appear to earn more than about 3 of these, with a vast amount of money poured into a film that nominators seem obliged to award Oscars to.

Love story mixed together with a big tragedy.,"James Cameron has done a good job making one of the centuries big block busters.He has used the tragic titanic accident as the background and mixed in a great love story about a poor kid and a rich women. This is really a big budget movie and it is not hard to figure out why,because they had to build everything new and some of the fx when the boat sinks are just amazing. The plot of the movie is not very deep and the 3 hours goes by like 2 hours and 50min. We must not forget that this is a BIG tragedy and that the love story is just fiction.It is not one of my favourit movies, but I have to give James Camron credit for making a big budget movie like this.If you are a guy between 15 and 30 I advice you to go and pick up a die hard movie instead.But if you are a girl or women then this is a must.Ps:I did actually see some boys coming crying out of the cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Not a great movie,"The twenty fifth anniversary of the movie just passed and it had some hype. Why this movie is so popular I do not know. The story was ok and the set was ok but the acting was horrible. Leonardo was so out of place in this film. Just before this movie came out in the theatre there was a TV version released. The TV version had a great cast with Peter Gallagher, Catherine Zeta-Jones, George C. Scott, Tim Curry and Marilu Henner. Their acting was superb. The TV version was longer than the movie so it had more time to develop the characters. There is definitely something wrong with movie reviewers and critics. Often a great movie gets no respect yet poor movies get top scores.I found it odd that a TV version would come out just before a theatre version.

The storyline is generally overwrought romance,"It's a disaster movie set in April 1912 and 1996 on board the ill-fated maiden voyage of the Titanic. Against the backdrop of the disaster, it follows the relationship of a poor upper-class woman, her wealthy fiancée, and a poor American sketch artist she meets on the ship.In the opening scenes set in 1996, we see Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) and his treasure-hunting crew search the wreck of the Titanic for a valuable pendant presumed to have gone down with the ship. However, instead of a pendant, they discover a nude drawing of a young woman wearing the jewel. The news story of their finding puts them in touch with a 100-year-old woman, Rose Dawson Calvert (Gloria Stuart). This woman then tells the story of the Titanic's voyage.Rose Bukater (Kate Winslet) is an American teenager engaged to Cal Hockley (Billy Zane), the wealthy son of a steel baron who can't see past his own ego and mistreats Rose. Rose is traveling with her mother, Ruth (Frances Fisher), who is desperate for the marriage to preserve her status. Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a poor artist who is only on the ship because he won a ticket in a poker game. He notices Rose immediately and talks her out of suicide after a terrible run-in with Cal.The film then follows the deepening relationship of Rose and Jack, as well as the strong reaction by Cal and Ruth. In the meantime, the events that eventually overwhelm the Titanic occur in the background. In the end, we learn how Rose survived and the fates of Jack, Cal, and Rose, as well as the priceless pendant.The technical visual effects (I watched in 3D in a theater) are stunning. However, Cameron was too in love with his technical gimmicks and over-extended numerous scenes, especially at the beginning. The portrayal of the Titanic striking the iceberg and ultimate sinking are powerful. However, the storyline is generally overwrought romance, though the chemistry between Winslet and DiCaprio is excellent. But some of the couple's ""escape"" scenes are over-extended to show off Cameron's toys.It does help to see the film in a large theater.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
