Love And War And Occupation,"After a somewhat slow start I thought this movie about the Italian occupation of a Greek island during World War II picked up and became a quite enjoyable watch for a couple of hours, from primarily two points of view.The love triangle is an interesting one and strikes me as believable, because I know it happened in various places under occupation. Penelope Cruz played Pelagia, a young Greek girl engaged to be married to Mandras (Christian Bale). I had questions about the depth of their love from the start, but their future was torn apart when Italy invaded Greece, and Mandras went off to fight. After German intervention, Greece is conquered and the island Pelagia lives on comes under Italian occupation, during which Pelagia meets and begins to fall in love with Captain Corelli (Nicholas Cage.) This, of course, was a dilemma that came to many young women in occupied lands. As they got to know their occupiers, they started to see them not as the enemy but as real people, and sometimes fell in love - often to the disapproval of their neighbours. I just finished reading an interesting book about the German occupation of Britain's Channel Islands in which this was a major issue. Once Mandras returns to the island, Pelagia is torn between them.The second background issue is the Italian occupation itself, which I thought was quite realistically portrayed. First was the contempt with which the island treated their Italian occupiers. Greece defeated Italy (quite true from a historical perspective) and was really conquered by the Germans. The refusal of the town to surrender to the Italians and instead to insist on surrendering to a German officer struck me as something that could well have happened (and was quite funny in fact. I loved the line, ""we would rather surrender to this German's dog than to you Italians."") The portrayal of the Italian troops also struck me as believable. The Italian Army was never enamoured of their German ally, and never enthusiastic about fighting with them. Although Hitler and Mussolini were close friends, their soldiers tended to treat each other with contempt. Here, the Italians are more interested in singing than fighting (which the German troops on the island simply can't understand,) and are ecstatic when Italy makes peace and withdraws from the war - until they discover that this may well make them prisoners of the Germans. It was all quite well done, I thought.It falters a bit at the end with an all too predictable finish, but still deserves praise.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Very Watchable,"Unlike many, I have not read the book and so I watched this purely as a film in its own right.  I'm not especially keen on romance dramas, and I expected this to be a bit slushy and/or operatic so I was rather hesitant about going to see it in the first place...But I'm glad I did, because it was good.  Beautiful, ""feel good"" scenery and with a light touch of humour that made it rather more endearing than a straight drama would have been.  The romance was gentle, inoffensive and sufficiently interwoven with enough ""proper"" story-telling to keep my interest, and the score was not too obtrusively operatic.Overall, the film takes a satisfying circular route from start to finish, inducing a range of emotions as it progresses.  It's about 2 hours long, but I didn't find myself fidgeting or looking at my watch once - and that's quite a feat for me!!  Very enjoyable.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Worth a watch,"After reading the book thought I would give the film a watch. As with any book adaptation the story is slightly changed and big chunks are missing, are they key parts yes. The film doesn't flow as well and you find yourself not very interested in some of the key players in the book. But I never wanted to stop the film which I think is key, it has something about it which keeps you glued. Perhaps the back drop.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Please read the book instead.,"Ok, it's a given that you cannot make a good movie from a good book. (Unless you make it a trilogy :-) But comparing the book Corelli's Mandolin to this movie it's clear how much has to be cut to fit a screenplay. The book is very funny in places, romantic (of course), dramatic. What's left of it in the film is inexplicable romance -- as other reviewers have remarked, it's unclear why she falls in love with the italian while her betrothed is still around, and I have no idea why this was changed from the book -- and some gratuitous gunning and bombing scenes, more than in the book which derives its power from not hammering on the obvious points. Whole characters are cut: Carlo has maybe 10 seconds screen time, while in the book he has a whole story line that runs several chapters.",,Anonymous,Music
Could have been better,"When I was watching this movie one thought had come to my mind for several times: ""It's not really what I expected, I thought it would be better"", but now that I finished watching it I realize: why should I expect a better result from this movie? Isn't it just a ""love story"" made up in Hollywood show's standards? Of course, it is! If so, why expect more?Captain Corelli's mandolin is a romance story in war time (WWII) and the plot which I was noticed about before watch the movie seemed very interesting to me. All that I didn't count was the ""Hollywood standard's"" touch... What I mean by this is that I expected a story a bit more realistic and with a stronger plot (which was not full of ""plot holes"" as this one is!) instead of this ""sweet story romance, with the perfect ending"", which we're used to watch in a great part of Hollywood's movies! Another Hollywood standard's gaffe which is very common is the natives' languages issue. The differences between Italian, Greek and German languages were all done just by a stupid accent, and all people seem to understand each other very well. The Italian and the German army arrive to a ""forgotten"" Greek island and they all understand each other very well as they all speak the same language! Of course it's just little technical details that don't even matter to the plot, but are all this little details which separate a good from a bad production!But the movie has not just bad-sided arguments! On the good side, I can find the original idea (which comes from a book), and the thought that is possible to be Human, and have Human feelings, even inside a War. It's possible to sing and be happy, have good feelings, to love and to be loved in a War time! Was because of that main idea that I wanted to watch this movie, and at this particular point I wasn't disappointed! I just was dissatisfied about the way it was made! Another good-sided argument is History's knowledge The movie is not very deep at that issue, but it's good enough to have a little idea how was the WWII in the Eastern-South Europe.Globally Captain Corelli's mandolin is not a bad movie but it's not as good as I initially though either, mostly because of the ""Hollywood show's standards"" up-mentioned.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Good Film, Read Book Afterwards","Here's a well-made war story, nicely shot and well-acted. The portraying of the Italian and German occupancy of Greek island Kefalonia is well-done. John Hurt as Pelagia's father and the island doctor is superb, Nicolas Cage does a good job as the Captain from the title, Penelope Cruz does a good job of being beautiful and batting her eyelashes at Cage. There's heroics and humor, there's drama and romance, and it is all set on an idyllic island.Oddly enough, a very similar, or should I say almost identical, storyline, with the same characters going through the same series of events, is told in a novel by the same title, written by Louis de Bernieres. This wonderful historical novel tells the story of beautiful Pelagia, daughter of doctor Iannis, and their life on Kefalonia during WWII. Pelagia's fiancee, local fisherman Mandras, enlists when the Italian Army invades northern Greece from Albania under false pretenses. When the Axis finally prevails, with a lot of help from the Germans, a garrison of Italian soldiers is stationed on the island, and Captain Corelli plays a big part in keeping the occupation a peaceful time. As Mandras joins the partisans, charming Corelli and his mandolin are quartered with the doctor and his beautiful daughter. Of course, this makes it a novel about love. But it is also a war novel, a summary of Greek history, a tale of Communist uprising in post-war Greece, a portrait of the madness of Mussolini, and, most importantly, an ode to island life on Kefalonia.Some of these elements return in the movie, but in general, it is an impossible book to film. I am glad nobody ever tried.The movie 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin', however, is worth seeing. Just make sure you read the book *after* you see the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Both The Accent & The Movie Stink,"I actually was looking forward to this movie. After reading a number of reviews before the release, it sounded like a genuinely nice film, one that was beautifully filmed and one with an interesting cast (Nicholas Cage, Penelope Cruz and John Hurt.)Well, it might have been all of those things BUT it is so boring that I defy almost anyone to sit through this in its entirety and keep attention. Also, Cage's attempt at speaking with an Italian accent is embarrassingly bad. He's such a good actor that I cringed every time he spoke in this film.'Disappointing"" seems to be the most-often word used by reviewers here to describe this film, and I totally agree.I guess it didn't take long for word to get out about how bad this movie was because, like Cage's accent, it did not do well.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Not as good as the novel but it has some very good parts of the novel and a bit more,"Since I read the novel and had a complete mental picture of the story already, it was hard to be fully unbiased at someone else's version of the ""picture"". Director John Madden gave it a good go but don't expect this to be the book.There should be a Best Supporting for John Hurt as Dr. Iannis. Of all the characters he stands alone in performance. Nicolas Cage is better than he usually is as the title role, even though his accent is a bit trite. Ms. Cruz is perfectly cast as Pelagia and she could have been ....well she is not the same as in the book...enough said ok?Now the scoop is the loyal side kick of Cage. I don't even know his name but he looks like a young Marlon Brando. My wife pointed the fact out to me and...well  he needed more lines and ...naw not possible...got a male star and....everyone knows the drill. In a summer of crummy nothings this movie, while flawed to be sure, is very nice.  Go see it.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Expecting the worst...,"I have to admit that I approached this movie with a sense of expectation and dread. Louis de Berniere's bestselling novel is one of my favourites and anyone who has read it will realise that there is no way in hell that any screen adaptation can be 100% faithful.All the way through I found myself convincing myself that the movie was unsuccessful, and had stripped the book's plot back so far as to render it redundant. The ending, however, is much better than that in the novel, and I could not stop thinking about the movie afterwards. Still, the plusses (John Toll's magnificent cinematography, Stephen Warbeck's great score, etc) I felt did not outweigh my initial negatives (Cage's miscasting, a heavily diluted script).But, two days later, I was queuing again to see Corelli, and although not perfect, I have to admit now that the movie is the best anyone could have expected. Cage is actually brilliant in a role that even de Berniere was concerned was not a fully rounded character: his carefree spirit which gives way to shattered remorse is spot on, and complements the superb double act of Penelope Cruz and John Hurt perfectly. David Morrissey is quietly effective as Weber, the Nazi officer trying to reconcile his feelings for his newfound Italian friends and his inbred superiority complex to those around him. And the fine Greco-Italian supporting cast bring de Berniere's sundrenched world of Cepholonia dazzlingly alive.On leaving the cinema second time around, I finally let go my passion for the novel which prevented me from fully appreciating the story of WW2 Cepholonia in cinematic terms. My hat goes off to John Madden who, despite the almost expected critical drubbing he is receiving from the British critics (any director who has had a major success like Shakespeare in Love behind them is always a target for these moaning ninnies!),has managed to transfer a terrifically difficult book to the big screen with such heart, verve and humanity (the core virtues of the novel, in fact) that he has created another classic love story that will probably only be fully appreciated when the dust has settled a few years from now.If you are a fan of the book, like me, it's hard, but try not to make the same mistake on your initial viewing. Try to erase the book from your mind for two hours, bathe yourself in the glorious Mediterranean atmosphere, and discover Corelli, Pelagia, Mandras, Dr Iannis, as if for the first time (pretend you're watching something made from an original screenplay), and I guarantee you won't be disappointed.In fact, you'll be eagerly waiting to own your own copy of this delightful movie on video or DVD.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Try some Berniéres!,"Few days ago I finished reading of Louis de Berniéres novel Captain Corelli's Mandolin. The book was really breathtaking. I was looking forward to see the movie right after reading the book. This succeeded really quickly. I was home alone and I started to watch maybe a half an hour after I have read the last page of this amazing book. It was after midnight already, but I could not wait to see how the film-makers captured the huge power of this masterpiece in the movie. But as I felt happy when I first saw images from book (Cephallonia weather and the whole atmosphere) - such I was disappointed when Berniéres' novel full of reality of life, war and everything slowly changed into silly romantic flick. Everything is too much simplified so the story goes too fast.I am sure, that if Louis de Berniéres himself should make film (screenplay) from any of his novels, it would cost a lot of money and 150 minutes of time at least. But it won't be sweet happy-end story about cute girls, charming italian captains and brave partisans. It would be much more. Life and Berniéres' characters aren't so simple. Somebody really thought that if he will fill the movie with quotes from the book, people will think that it actually is book. This isn't bad film...I still give 7 points from 10. It's just deeply disappointing for those who read the novel. Maybe there are many perfect novels in the background of many average hollywood flicks. But sometimes there will be much better not to shoot some fine books... For those, who have read this commentary till now I have one advice - if you like superior reading and not just movie love stories - try some Berniéres!",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Painful,"I haven't read the book so I'm not anal about the movie digressing from the original plot. But it's still a horrible movie. If you want to make a schlocky love movie with Nicholas Cage affecting a risible Italian accent like out of some Little Cesar's Pizza commercial, be my guest. But please show some respect and don't base it on a real tragedy, the bloody German-Italian occupation of Greece in the Second World War and the 1943 massacre of 9000 Italian troops by the Germans.To be fair to the movie, Penelope Cruz does her usual excellent job of playing an attractive girl who painfully holds out against her romantic feelings before eventually giving in to love. The only problem is that I've seen her in this role before. Other than that, the movie is 1950ies-type of inane. The Greeks are proud archetypes (but hey, daddy's still all for emancipation and that), the Italians are jolly opera boffins, and the Germans uptight, evil maniacs. Beautiful, proud Pelagia is betrothed to a resistance fighter but has the hots for a jaunty Italian soldier. You connect the dots. That's really all there is to it.The sad thing is that the entire plot's long been done before, a million times better, and with infinitely more charme, in the 1991 Italian movie Mediterraneo. If you like the general idea of a romantic comedy about Italians occupying a Greek island, and going native in the process, you've struck gold. Captain Corelli's Mondolin, on the other hand, is trite sh*te.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
"Sketchy, Melodramatic and Clichéd","The main problem with 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' is that it focuses primarily on the romance between Corelli and Pelagia and that too is half-baked. What is it that draws Pelagia towards him is too unclear. Is it just his musical talent or his zest? The film is set against the backdrop of a war between the Germans and Italians in a Greek island but the war is given less significance and what we see appears very sketchy. The entire film appears too sketchy, melodramatic and clichéd. Much of it is also historically inaccurate.On the technical front it is well executed. The cinematography of the beautiful exotic locations is breathtaking. The score is terrific. Where acting is concerned, Penelope Cruz can't seem to lose her Spanish accent (she's playing a Greek character) but her performance is otherwise wonderful. John Hurt and Christian Bale are equally marvelous. Nicolas Cage is a miscast. His Italian accent, energetic personality, overdone non-verbal gestures all yield to a caricature rather than a character.Perhaps director John Madden was pressured to fit the entire novel into a two hour period and he chose to focus on the romance more to draw a larger crowd. I can't shake the feeling that perhaps someone like Anthony Mingella would have made a better and more complete film of it.",,Anonymous,Music
"Great Movie! Romance, War, Passion, and Wonderful Scenery","I enjoyed this movie so much that I saw it twice. It's kind of slow in the beginning, but I never thought for a second this was a defect; on the contrary, its slowness contributes to recreate the tranquil atmosphere of the stupendous Greek island of Cephallonia as it was in the forties. The photography of the island was so beautiful that I was almost able to smell the olive oil and the leaves on the trees.The main characters were noble, heroic, and honest. The second time I saw the movie, I appreciated even more the figure of the Greek Mandras. His very last scene with Pelagia is a perfect image of how a man can accept a hurting future with incredible dignity and honor. I really admired the guy. I liked Corelli and the soldiers of the Opera House because their jovial character reminded me of many of my friends in Italy, gathered in huge parties driving around at night and singing while waiting for the bakery to open at four in the morning in order to get a croissant. I liked the beautiful, strong, and intelligent Pelagia and her wise and loving father Iannis. I loved the entire atmosphere of the island, which reminded me of my father's small village in Southern Italy. These Mediterranean places have one exceptional thing in common: time seems to run slower over there, letting you fully appreciate the beauty and the serenity of the community and the scenery.There is something weird about all the accents that somehow declasses the movie a little, and makes it look less sumptuous than it is. I understand that some people may feel a little puzzled by this cornucopia of Italian, Greek, German, and Spanish (Penelope Cruz) accents, even though this aspect did not bother me at all.Anyways, the main reasons that made me like the movie were the growing appreciation of the Greeks and the Italians for each other's cultures, the ability of the characters to elevate human dignity and pure sentiments over the brutality of war, and last but not least the contrast between the Latin culture of the Greeks and the Italians on one hand and the Teutonic culture of the Germans on the other. Finally, this movie made me think a lot about the very meaning of war and about the fact that you can call somebody enemy only until you actually get to know that person. That is the moment when he or she stops being an impersonal shadow and becomes part of your world, and sometimes - like in this movie  he or she can even become `your world.'Inspiring.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

"Solid:  good story, graceful execution","Range of performance from actors was on the whole good; Nicolas Cage and John Hurt doing really quite well - although Cage's part had more scope.Cage's accent was quite believable as English with an Italian lilt. Hurt's, as Greek, was less so; lapsing into pure English occasionally.  The English/German accents were pretty terrible, no points for Patrick Malahide or David Morrissey.  Ranges of the Greek island natives was small, but then, having been occupied by the Italians, they didn't have very much to smile about.All the acting was very good, down to passable.  Points to Cage and Hurt for some great performances as the suave love-struck Italian and rugged, long-suffering Greek father respectively.The story - okay, a group of opera-singing Italian artillerymen is perhaps not the most natural subject, but the boys could definitely sing; Cage's mandolin playing was haunting and thoroughly believable (I can't believe it wasn't him playing it, in fact).  The story is classic love-triangle material, but a war and a twist keep it interesting.The cinematography was excellent, John Toll showing us the lush Greek Cephallonian landscape. However, with scenery as striking as this, Toll could hardly go wrong by just pointing the camera anywhere.  The scenery, already really a character of its own, becomes somewhat more dominant toward the end.Pacing was rather slow for my taste. Some shots lingered a little too long when I was expecting a cut.  General pacing was slow; with the start of the third act being a jarring acceleration into high-gear.  After that the pacing slows down again with a slight bump toward the end.Overall: for someone interested in a solid film, and willing not to bitch about the pacing, this is definitely one to see.  Good story, direction, and cinematography.  If the editor could tighten it up a little, this would be 8/10; otherwise 6.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Ambitious project falls slightly short,"As is often the case when you attempt to take a 400 plus page book and cram it into a two hour film, a lot is lost.  Here director John Madden (Shakespeare in Love) takes on an extremely ambitious project and almost pulls it off.  What we get is a charming and emotionally compelling film that seems somehow incomplete.There is much about this film that is wonderful and fantastic.  The cinematography by John Toll (Cinematographer for Braveheart and Legends of the Fall, winning Oscars for both) is splendid.  Working with Madden, the choices for locations on the Greek island of Kefallonia are superb and the visual images that come from photographing these majestic locations in varying light are lush and beautiful.  Madden also uses numerous Greek actors as the townspeople, giving the town an authentic feel.  The soundtrack is also terrific and the mandolin passages and vocals by the Italian soldiers are marvelous.Madden does an excellent job of bringing us the Italian occupation and the romance, which take up the greater part of the film.  There are numerous sweet and funny moments throughout this segment.  However, by the time the serious battle drama is ready to unfold, there isn't much film left in the reel and this component is extremely rushed and abbreviated.  While the battle scenes are well done, subsequent to the battle it is obvious that increasingly greater compromises are being made to keep the film from running too long. By the time we reach the post war scenes, the treatment is merely skeletal.  Another negative is that the DVD is particularly sparse on features.Nicholas Cage is charming in the romantic lead as the sentimental Captain who seems to have joined the army to sing rather than fight.  When fight he must, Cage switches gears seamlessly into a man of fierce principle and resolve and somehow remains believable in both personas.Penelope Cruz, whom the camera loves, gives an uninspired performance as Pelagia.  In part this is because Cage so dominates the screen, but Cruz just seems too placid in a part that should be emotionally torrential and dynamic.  She allows the character to be objectified as Corelli's love interest rather than establishing her as a powerful character in her own right.John Hurt gives a fantastic performance as the wise old doctor, who knows as much about human nature as medicine.  However, Christian Bale seems a bit overwrought and stiff as Pelagia's fiancé.I rated this film an 8/10.    Despite some drawbacks, this is a touching film that is well worth seeing.  The photography alone is worth the price of admission.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Comments of Victor-65 generally right, but too critical of film","Generally, I agree with the comments by Victor-65. But it's always hard to compress a pretty long book into a 2-hour movie. I think the producers have dealt with the essentials reasonably well. The acting of the principals, especially the reliable John Hurt as the village doctor, is excellent. And the atmosphere of a small Greek village of that era is re-created well. The Penelope Cruz character falls for the Italian while her Greek fiancé is away fighting with the partisans, not while he's still around. I stayed in Sami, on Kefallonia, where much of the film was shot, less than a year later, and it's a community still to some degree traumatized by what went on there during the war. They had many stills from the film on a big board on the waterfront, a sign of their approval and recognition of its general accuracy.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

beautiful & moving,"I haven't read Louis de Berniere's book, and don't know anything about the history, so I can't comment on the faithfulness of the film to either*. But Captain Corelli's Mandolin stood on it's own as a beautiful & moving story set on the stunningly lovely Greek island of Cephalonia. Go and see it if only for a sneak preview of your next holiday destination! Nicolas Cage's accent, shall we say, under-utilised his Italian background, but this is fairly easily ignored if you set out to enjoy the movie. Penelope Cruz carries the movie - she is gorgeous as Pelagia. There is an interesting bit just when Pelagia's local beau is about to leave to fight & he gives a lovely on-bended-knee speech, but only to set her up for a gag, as it turns out. Our emotions are easily aligned with Pelagia' feelings of confused humiliation.  The relationship between Pelagia & her father (John Hurt) is sweet & lightly drawn.*Go & see Captain Corelli's Mandolin even if you get uptight about the possibility that the movie will be different from the book - they're completely different mediums & movies can't possibly reproduce in every detail what's is a book, or vice versa.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

cliched movie with poor acting,"i am amzed at how many people think the acing in this movie was good. nicolas cage has one expression & tone throughout the movie and penelope cruz has none.the story in many parts was very predictable and stale. the saving graces in the movie were the excellent locales, beautiful cinematography & the lilting music. i dont much care for the ""historical inaccuracies"" - i mean after all this is cinema for god's sake. so no complaints there.the worst thing was the total lack of ingenuity in the plot. apparently its a great book, i havent read it. the movie is a bit of a pot-boiler with a little bit of everything thrown in for good measure.having said all this, the movie is comfortable to watch and lightly handled, no melodrama here. well not  much anyway. the best scenes are with john hurt as the elderly Dr. & father. the standout scene is when he explains what love is to his daughter, was a very moving & touching scene. especially, when he points out the difference between love & being in love. a whole new perspective and a really memorable scene. however, scenes of such caliber are in short supply.an average 6",6.0,Anonymous,Music
The book is better,"Please never watch this film, at least not until you have read the book and savoured its exquisite language and evocative imagery, which a screenplay simply cannot do justice to. They also change the ending in the film which means that the plot loses a lot of its emotive power. The only thing which is good about the film is the musical score, which isn't bad, and which, of course you have to imagine in the film. Nicholas Cage's acting is truly awful, he is wooden and yet cheesy at the same time, you cannot fall in love with him the way you can with the literary Captain Corelli.

A Travesty with a Miscast Leading Lady.,"An awful travesty of the Greek resistance. Senorita Cruz badly miscast as a Cephalonian Greek girl (there are plenty of attractive good English speaking Greek actresses so why pick a Spanish lady for one of the leading roles and with an English actor as her father, supposedly a Greek doctor!? Many of the supporting cast are well known actors and actresses from Greek theatre and TV series. The only foreign actor, to my knowledge, who has successfully portrayed a Greek was Anthony Quinn (as the Macedonian lignite miner Zorba in Zorba the Greek, as the plutocratic shipowner in the Greek Tycoon,and as a Greek colonel in the Guns of Navarone.There is some historical truth reflected in the film. People who remember the Italian occupation of the Ionian Islands agree that the Italians were not harsh, unlike the Germans who succeeded them. Also Mussolini's forces, as hinted in the movie, had been defeated by the Greek army in the Albanian campaign. After the Germans intervened in the Balkans they allowed the Italian military to occupy certain parts of Greece, so the refusal of the local government to surrender to Italian forces, rather than to the Germans. as portrayed in the film is quite plausible, although I am not certain this actually happened.",1.0,Anonymous,Music

I have heard the true history from my relatives that still live in Cephalonia, but when watching the movie and reading the book the sketchy bits of history were filled. It is all true, the Italians would sing, the oppression and the earthquakes that rock the island so often. The earthquake in 1953 killed my great grandfather and the book and movie both portray the feeling of the era with great compassion. If you haven't seen the movie go and watch it and read the book, it is not only a love story, and yes, there were plenty of Italians in love with Cephallonian women, in fact, boat loads of Cephallonian women were taken to Italy after the war, it is a true depiction of history.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Lackluster,"Didn't know what the movie was about, but upon viewing, it did not inspire like other epic movies of similar genre.  It does not have the sense of love-torn apart by undue circumstances and reunited against all odds the movie's description tried to represent.As far as the actors, I never sensed the chemistry between Penélope Cruz and Nicholas Cage.  Penélope Cruz's character Pelagia is convincingly filmed, but when she talks, I don't know what comes out, she isn't even trying to do a Greek accent.  Plus anytime she speak English, it sound monotonic and unconvincing, the only variation being her raising her voice.  She isn't as bad as she was in other movies, but she still didn't pull it off.  It was a big leap of faith for the producers to cast her on a such major role and their gamble did not pay.  Nicholas Cage's character Captain Antonio Corelli's Italian accent seems to only have one pitch, and when the acting gets demanding, it disappears.Even if the 2 characters did fall in love and had their brief fling as depicted in the movie, I fail to see how Penélope Cruz's character fell out of love with her fiancee because she never saw him or had her mail replied (apparently, he can't read,) but could stay in love with Capt Corelli long after he left the island.Otherwise, the story was decent, with movie going through tragedy, lovers separating and reuniting.  The film was beautifully filmed on the Greek isles.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Better than I thought.,"It was obvious to me that this one would be yet another one of those movies Hollywood tries to feed you every once in a while. Based on a generally appreciated book the story is set in 1940 in the beautiful island of Kefalonia (Cephalonia) in Greece and presents life under the Italian, and then German occupation through a generally lighthearted romance between a Greek girl and an Italian captain (yes, that would be Cage).I was surprised to find out that the movie was *much* better than I thought. Perhaps, if I expected a quality film I'd be very disappointed. The movie combined history with romance in an intriguing way which kept you going until the very last minute. The photography was amazing and the music was subtle and almost unnoticeable at times. Casting could have been better, with Nicholas Cage being anything but an Italian and Penelope Cruz having the tendency to just stand there looking at the camera doing nothing.I'd probably recommend it to someone who'd like to rent a movie for a night in and looking for something less challenging/heavy than other movies involving war and history.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
A masterful non-Hollywood movie beautifully filmed.,"I should have seen this movie earlier but seeing it at this late date after release did in no way diminish the tremendous enjoyment of the film.  I admit it-I love non-American films-even if those films are American products.  But this was so totally non-Hollywood in texture, locations and substance that I can easily forgive the intrusion of Hollywood personalities.The script, the acting and the remarkably beautiful cinematography were so engrossing that the minor problems of plot simply were drowned in beautiful images. John Toll's brilliant camera work immediately impresses the viewer-so good that this viewer will rent the video more just to appreciate the beautiful play of light and dark in the screens images.  I honestly felt that those images were three dimensional-that they could be lifted from the theatre and carried away.Early on in his career, I watched Cage in what I thought was a dog of a film-something about angels in white robes standing on California beaches and subsequently dismissed him but after watching Corelli I must reassess his work-I thought the casting of him as the semi-professorial Corelli was a master stroke.To make any comment on the events that occurred on Corelli's island is to trivialize those events because somebody sitting in Fremantle looking back can never appreciate the monstrousness of what happened.  Hindsight is not an aide in this  case but I do believe that movie magic was laid before viewers of this film.",,Anonymous,Music
For Penelope Cruz Fans Only,"There is only one reason to watch Captain Corelli's Mandolin: Penelope Cruz.Though her performances vary little film to film, she has an ethereal beauty and an irresistible vulnerability that make her worth seeing over and over and over again. Her performances lack energy, some may say, but I say that they are subtle and soft, gentle and sensitive and when she does show her passion, it erupts with depth and conviction. We believe her. We have to. She acts from the inside out and so is incapable of telling a lie.Nicolas Cage is poorly cast as an Italian soldier. His sweet, good-natured Charlie in ""I Could Happen To You,"" didn't quite translate here. John Hurt is a great actor and has a weathered enough face to look the part of Cruz's father, an aging Greek country doctor, but fell just a tad short in his performance too. He's too - I'll say ""English"" - to pull it off.Aside from Cruz, Christian Bale was well cast as Mandras, a brave and noble soldier and Cruz' fiancé. His character was a bit macho and I suppose that was one of the reasons Cruz fell for Cage's more sensitive Corelli, but it was never quite believable.In the Cruz films I've seen (""Vanilla Sky,"" ""All The Pretty Horses"" and this one) the directors seem to use her sparingly. She pops in when needed. She's left a bit of a mystery. I never get the sense of who her characters really are. We usually see her only when and as her love interests see her. That's a shame. Because I could never see too much of her.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
not bad but nicholas cage ruined it,"A good story, beautiful settings and you can't go wrong putting both John Hurt and Penelope Lopez in a movie. But we were only a couple of minutes in when Nicholas Cage appeared, said his first lines and I was cringeing. I think it was partly what he was asked to do and say and partly his overacted delivery but somehow, for me anyway, he just wasn't right for the part.I had a problem with the accents too. Cage was playing an Italian so spoke English with a strange Italian accent. Hurt played a Greek with an English accent. Cruz played a Greek woman so spoke English with a Spanish accent! Can't remember the Germans because as usual in Hollywood war movies they didn't get to have a character.It got a bit boring towards the end and probably should have been cut down. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Bland and syrupy,"Not having read past the first chapter of the book I was happy to judge this film entirely on its own merits rather than comparing it with the well-known novel. Almost, anyway - the first chapter I remember was hilarious - yet the momentum is sadly lacking in the opening scene which dismisses the humour within seconds. World War II approaches and Germany and Mussolini invade Greece. Nicolas Cage, as the unconvincing Italian captain who is more attuned to singing than warfare, demonstrates quite admirably that this is the sort of film he should leave well alone. Penelope Cruz, as the Greek girl betrothed to another but who falls in love with Cage is slightly better, but not enough to lift this bland and syrupy film above mediocrity. The rest of acting is fairly wooden, most of the script quite predictable, and the moral ambiguities of fighting for the 'right' side barely touched. The ending is unsatisfactory,as if we are expected to wait a couple of years and part with more money for part two. Part one didn't hold enough promise - the tedium and self-adoration in the photography and music failed to justify a film of over two hours that could have risen (but fell) on its own merits and lack of them, but it will most surely disappoint the many fans of what is reputedly an excellent novel.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
A war movie shouldn't be a brochure for romantic holidays,"I never had the feeling I was watching a war movie. This was nothing but a touristic brochure about the Greek Islands for young couples. It's sweeter than candy and has almost nothing to do with WWII, even though it pretends to be a war movie.The story begins just before the war starts. Pelagia is engaged with a local fisherman against her father's will. Then the war starts and all the young men of the village go to war, fighting the Italians in Albania. Just before her fisherman leaves, she marries him and she promises that she will write him letters every day. She never gets a reply and doesn't know if he is still alive. In the meanwhile the Italians are defeated, but her husband hasn't returned. Hitler has send German troops to help the Italians and Greece looses the war after all. The Italians occupy Greece, but still no sight of her fisherman... An Italian captain is housed in their home. She hates him but after some time she starts to love him of course.If you think you will see any action shots of the war the first 1.5 hours, you will be very disappointed. The only thing that you'll get to see is the love-hate relationship between the captain and Pelagia, Italians singing, dancing, drinking and making love... Trust me the movie's pace is so slow that you would like to push the fast forward button all the time because much isn't happening. Don't think that I wanted to see explosions all the time. I like romantic stories, but not if almost nothing happens in it.Another reason why I will not see this movie again is because everybody seems to speak the same language, only with a small difference in accents. It doesn't matter if it is an Italian, a German or a Greek, they all speak English. Only a few times I heard some German, in the background. Especially Nicholas Cage's Italian accent was awful. I know, it's still a Hollywood movie, they need some known actors in it to make sure it gets enough publicity. If that's the only thing the producers were thinking about I can only say they succeeded. If they wanted an authentic feeling they should have hired actual Greeks, Germans and Italians. I'm sure there are some great actors in these countries as well.What I did like about the movie was the scenery. The landscapes were absolutely beautiful. Like I said, it felt more like a brochure for romantic holidays. Seeing all the landscapes made me almost jump on the next plane to Greece so I could spend the rest of my life there. Let's be honest, that's not good if you want to shoot a war movie, is it? Or do you guys want to spend the rest of your lives in a ghetto with an extra trip to a concentration camp perhaps?No, this movie really couldn't convince me. I don't have any problem with a romantic movie or with a war movie. I don't even mind if the two are combined into one, as long as it is good. I give this movie a 5.5/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
patently offensive TRASH (in addition to pathetic film making),"Firstly let me issue a disclaimer by stating that I was born in Greece. That out of the way, and without going into too much detail about Cage's laughably pathetic accent and the over-the-top acting by everyone not named Hurt, I have to focus on the fact that this movie is grossly offensive to Greeks.Please consider that this movie is based on a book which purports to be based on history. Therefore, I believe that it carries with it a responsibility of staying true (as much as possible) to history. It wasn't just a context/backdrop for a story, it was *history*. And if the knee-jerk defense is ""well, it's the book at fault, not the film"", then I castigate the story as a whole: film/screenplay/book.My mother read the book on which the film is based, and was so thoroughly offended by its bias that she had to put it down 2/3 of the way through. Upon hearing that the author got a lot of flak for stretching some truths and outright fictionalizing some very important historical elements, and that the screenplay toned these down to be more historically faithful, we thought to go see the film and see if it did a better job.I was so put off by the film that I left before it ended. Rather than give you a laundry list of historical inaccuracies (you can find those anywhere on the web through a google search), I want to state that the way they portrayed the Italian military/occupiers in the film as peace-loving, song-loving, wine and dance-loving romantics, although they were part of the AXIS powers (remember, Hitler? Nazis? that whole thing?) was ridiculous, especially when contrasted with the way they portrayed the Greek resistance fighters (among whom my grandfather was counted as one) as brutish, glowering, violent animals...it was nauseating. The Greeks were INVADED and were protecting their home. The film seemed to portray a more sympathetic picture of the Italians when they were 'betrayed' by the Nazis than it did of the Greeks for protecting their home in the first place.How would we as Americans feel if we went to a movie about the Revolutionary War, and saw the British portrayed as peace-loving heroes and the minutemen and revolutionaries portrayed as murderous, brutish thugs? Yes, I'm aware there was fighting and guerrilla tactics; it's not about the actions taken so much as the light in which they're depicted. And, personally, I think that would be more defensible as a film because the Colonies were rebels, and England was trying to protect her interests, as opposed to a free/independent nation being invaded and occupied and then trying to defend itself. This film really tried to slant the audience into sympathizing with the invaders, instead of (at the very least) just portraying what happened, or perhaps even (gasp) generate sympathy for the invaded.So yes, the movie does the Greek countryside some justice, and may be pretty to look at on some level, but most of the critics of the film (as a piece of film-making) are SPOT on, and I add a personal note of extreme umbrage at the license taken in portraying the Greeks as virtually without any honor at all and of the Italians as virtual heroes. Book and movie both offensive historically, and movie offensive cinematic ally as well.Trash.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Great supporting but awful lead casting...,"Just exactly HOW director John Madden come to settle with Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz playing the roles of an Italian Officer and a Greek Villager in an honourable story: ""Captain Correli´s Mandolin"", just escapes me! Witness: a wobbly, inconsistent accent by Cage amid horrendous over-acting, with Cruz -- more adequately cast as a spoiled Latino opposite Johnny Depp in ""Blow"" -- in basically a repeat performance under the guise of a Greek nurse... ay, it was painful.  But there were saving graces.The story itself is thrilling-to-tragic, and Cage does have some (-- redeeming, this is !--) musical ability.  Next, a superb performance by John Hurt (Cruz´s father, the village doctor) of Oscar Callibre, as well as by Irene Papas, each as village elders, as well as by Christian Bale (Papas´ son) among the village freedom fighters, go far towards counter-balancing awkward performances (especially at the beginning) by Cruz and Cage. Nicely, the last two seem to grow into their respective roles as the film progresses, but it´s teeth-gnashing early on.  Finally, the scenery itself and the photography could garner a technical award, and such provides pleasant distractions when most needed.John Hurt already has two Oscar nominations and this would be a third; I hope he gets it as his performance as the Doctor makes this film worth seeing.  The true test of a supporting actor/actress is whether or not the film would be the same without the personage in question, and in this case, it would most certainly not be... not even close.Entertainment value but for the aformentioned plus factors which do help raise the bar.  See it if you haven´t.  Rating = 3.5 stars (of five).",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Music can bring love,"At first I didn't think I would like this movie, but as it progressed it became better and better.  I love music and I was impressed with how well Cage could fake the movements of playing a mandolin.  My son was with me and he also like the movie a lot for its music and the story and the way the story unfolded--- slowly showing how Corelli won the girls heart.  The acting and the story were both well done and well directed. At first Corelli's bravado was irritating, but soon he grew on you. The twists in the plot were intriguing especially the relations with the Germans.  I would like to see this again to follow all the side plots.

You truly felt like you were in Greece in that era..The photography and location shots were fabulous..the portrayal of the italian soldier was truly on the mark ..These men had never seen battle and looked upon the war as a lark..Remember Pearl Harbor and how the common sailor acted...The turning point from this attitude to one of reality was handled well..The romance between Cage and Cruz was handled delicately Since when can you no longer have a romance in a film. The criticism of the accents may be well founded but I did not find it detrimental to the film...I also must applaud the make up and costumes ..You truly felt transported to that era..Do not let the current rating system keep you from seeing this truly unique and enjoyable film....,,Anonymous,Music
Beautiful but........,"Once again John Madden has given us a magnificent film. A simple but beautiful story  located in a real paradise and the music can't be better, Stephen Warbeck delights us once more, and good actings but.........why on earth is Penelope Cruz in this film? I asked myself that same question while watching this movie. Of course her greek accent is not believable, she's uncapable of acting decently not even in one scene. Not even at the end she did a good job, after so many events, after years she finally gets to see Corelli again and she couldn't change the same face of stupidy we had to bear during the whole film. Anyway, Cage was very good in one of his best characters; Hurt also is great in his and the rest of the cast all did a great job, so the final result is a movie that really is worth of watching. This is a beautiful film that not even Mrs. Cruz was able to spoil. So far I think it's Madden best work so no fan will be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Regrettable,"Far and away one of the worst films I have ever wasted time watching. I knew 5 minutes into it that Nicholas Cage would never be convincing as an Italian, his accent was that bad. I kept thinking that it was Cage trying to be an Italian, and for that matter Cruz was just as bad. In order for a film to be successful one must be able to suspend belief, and the characters must inhabit their roles. Neither actor did this.Bale was quite good, actually the only redeeming factor in the film. The war scenes were comical, the music was overdone, and Cage, well, let's just say that this is a movie that did not need to be made. Or rather, if one is going to make it, for God's sake use an actor that can be convincing. The story is actually interesting-the movie is a complete butchery.My favorite line is when Bale asks Cruz if she had really fallen out of love with him, and actually had never really loved him at all, she says 'sorry'. A terribly accidental moment of comic relief.Please don't waste your time on this film. Watch Matchstick Men again, or The Orchid Thief, if you want a Nick Cage fix.",1.0,Anonymous,Music

There have been good adaptations and there have been bad but its the ones that just don't do a story justice which are the ones that cut me deep.Captain Corelli's Mandolin was a beautiful, shocking, poignant novel and above all it was extremely witty despite all the hardships depicted in the story. It is these hardships and this wit which the film is afraid to tackle. I waited in anticipation to see how my image of that beautiful Greek island would play out but I was disappointed.I urge anybody who saw the film and thought it was pretty mediocre or even rubbish to seek out Louis de Bernieres astounding novel, read it and see how the story is supposed to be told.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Corelli on Cruise Control,"Several people I know were really excited to see this movie, because the marketing made it look very dramatic and romantic.  There were shots of this beautiful, peaceful, idyllic Greek island and of pitched battle shattering the paradise.  An intense romance was supposed to emerge from this twisted set of circumstances.  If the movie had moved dramatically from peace at the beginning to fury near the end, the romance that emerged probably would have been pretty dramatic.  The problem with this movie is that neither peace nor war is actually in this movie.  The majority of this movie takes place during an unstable and unpleasant, but not necessarily volatile, military occupation.  And because the action cruises at such a middling pace, refusing to commit to one ideal or the other, the idyllic, star-crossed romance people expected never materialized.  I was disappointed.The most fitting word to describe this movie is probably ""Petty.""  The film seems to strive to show how everything that happens on this little Greek island is completely unimportant to everybody involved, but they still act really serious about everything they come across, even when they're supposed to be having fun.  The characters all seem to be in vaguely bad moods all the time, as if they wouldn't even bother to talk to one another unless the film required them to in order to advance its plot, slowly and inexorably, toward its garbled, mistimed conclusion.This movie is a major watch-looker, folks.  That is, as you sit and take in this movie, you will look at your watch frequently.  Very frequently.  And if you don't, you won't have any idea when it's going to end, and the answer you'll want to hear is ""Now.""",3.0,Anonymous,Music

Amore nostrum,"Captain Corelli's Mandolin"" emerges as a visually captivating masterpiece, skillfully portraying the serene landscape of the Greek island of Cephallonia through John Toll's exceptional cinematography. The lush Mediterranean scenery becomes almost a character itself, providing a vibrant backdrop to the unfolding drama. Toll's work is remarkable, transforming every frame into a visual feast that immerses the viewer in the heart of the island.Stephen Warbeck's soundtrack seamlessly intertwines with the narrative, enriching its emotional depth with operatic nuances. Warbeck's score delicately enhances the film's tone, lending poignancy to both romantic and dramatic moments.Technically, ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin"" is well-crafted, albeit occasionally faltering with pacing issues. The film starts slowly, mirroring the tranquility of island life, which contributes to its atmospheric storytelling.Comparisons with Gabriele Salvatores' award-winning 'Mediterraneo' are inevitable. Unlike 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin,' 'Mediterraneo' explores the Mediterranean landscape with a lighter, comedic tone, focusing on the Italian occupation of a Greek island during World War II. Salvatores infuses the film with whimsy and irony, using humor to highlight the absurdities of war and occupation.Both films excel in using setting and music to create immersive experiences. While ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin"" offers a polished and visually rich experience, ""Mediterraneo"" stands out for its simplicity and heartfelt humor, portraying wartime relationships and human resilience with warmth. Despite their tonal differences, both films leverage the Mediterranean setting to create evocative cinematic journeys.In ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin,"" the romantic relationship between an Italian soldier and a Greek woman unfolds amidst World War II's Italian occupation of Cephallonia. The war casts a constant shadow, deeply influencing the characters' lives. Music, particularly Corelli's mandolin, plays a pivotal role, symbolizing connection beyond linguistic and cultural barriers.Similarly, ""Mediterraneo,"" directed by Gabriele Salvatores, portrays a love story between Italian soldiers and Greek women during wartime, yet with a lighter touch. The film employs humor to navigate the complexities of war's impact on personal relationships. Music in ""Mediterraneo"" contributes to its optimistic and playful atmosphere, contrasting sharply with the wartime context.Both films excel in cinematography, capturing the Mediterranean's beauty effectively. John Toll's cinematography in ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin"" transforms Cephallonia into a visual paradise, while ""Mediterraneo"" utilizes the Greek landscape as a vital narrative element, reflecting its beauty and isolation.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
At last a movie with very beautiful sceneries !,"A nice and pleasant movie full of meditteranean sceneries (Cephallonia is a very beautiful greek island) that keeps many of the novel's characteristics.  I think that greek sceneries add something special and magical to a movie. One thing i didn't like at all though, is that the main characters, like 'Mandras' and Pelagia's father weren't greek actors but foreigners.  I mean the actors tried to express the greek way of living, but to me they didn't succeed and it was quite clear.  Even their pronunciation when they were trying to use greek words was terrible and that was bad for the film's plot. Irene Papas was really great in her role, a typical example of a mother, living in a island during the 40's, who has lost her husband and tries to live a child alone.  John Hurt, Pelagia's father, also acted great.  He reminded me a greek in many of his reactions.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Worst movie of the year??,"Few words can adequately describe quite how bad this movie is. Having not read the book, I didn't come with expectations of how the characters should look or act. There is not a single moment of truth in this film - in other words, the 'actors' (and I use the term loosely) always look as if they're play-acting in a film. None of them become the characters they are meant to be portraying. Many of them look as if they want to laugh. If the characters are Greek or Italian the would, in reality, speak Greek or Italian. This being a film for the English speaking world, instead they use accented English. It is amusing when someone reads aloud from a letter written in Greek - which is seen on screen - and does so in English. But the problem really was the variety of accents. Was there no voice coach on this film? Not one of the actors comes close to voicing 'Greek-English'. Penelope Cruz sounds determinedly Spanish while John Hurt and Christian Bale have obviously been studying Tomi Conti's lamentable accent in Shirly Valentine. David Morrisey - a fine actor who has appeared in many British TV productions - gives a woeful performance as a German, with another accent of no fixed abode. Nicolas Cage - vastly overrated as an actor - is dead in the eyes and never brings Captain Corelli alive for one moment. Given that Hurt is a brilliant actor, Bale wonderful in American Psycho and Cruz amazing in All About My Mother, the performances they give in this film are superficial and extremely disappointing.The film - mercifully short at around 2 hours - looks as if it were cobbled together, so bad is the narrative. There is no sense of time or pace and the crowd scenes have obviously been cobbled together using local extras (I presume). During the war scenes, dead people are artfully arranged on the ground, false dollops of blood on their shoulders or backs. There is no sense of the horror of war. Noone seems particularly frightened when they're being shot at.No one seems to have aged or developed during the course of the film - with the exception of some obviously false facial hair on Christian Bale. John Madden, who directed the wonderful Mrs Brown, is perhaps out of his depth bnut has not been aided by the script or the performers.On the plus side (yes, there is one) the scenery is wonderful and because of that, thousands will probably flock to the island where it was filmed. At least the director of photography did a good job.If there is a worse big budget film this year, I will be extremely surprised. Save your money; Don't go.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Beautifully made war/romance movie,"This movie is about war, romance during war times, Greek people and their braveness, Italians that prefer music and dance, to war, and germans that are determined to end both ways of thinking and cultures.If the low rating is due to some sort of dislike of what is depicted on the movie, politically or innacurate facts, if you put that aside you have a beautifully crafted movie, with outstanding actors.How is the rating so low on IMDB it is a mystery. I recommend this movie to everyone that wants to ""live"" in an occupied country, first by italians(which were not too keen on making war"" and the germans that are really determined on conquering Greece, except one german that appreciates both cultures, italian and greek, which makes us think that not all germans were """"demonized"".If you can keep all partiallity aside you will see the ebauty in this film.Solid 10 for me, and should have a solid 8 average on IMDB.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Heil Puccini !,"At the lowest level, this is about people surviving the worst that war and nature can throw at them. At the end of the film, the Greeks of Cephalonia can still celebrate traditional festivals, even after all the tragedy of the seven years which this film covers.The true victims of the war are the unmilitary Italian army who occupy Cephalonia after Greece surrenders to Hitler. Captain Corelli, played by Nicholas Cage, exemplifies them; he hasn't seen action, and would rather not. He and his men would rather be a choir or a musical ensemble than a fighting unit. When they must fight the ruthless Germans, they are exterminated.As might be expected from a film made on a holiday destination, the scenery is mouth-watering. The music (Greek traditional and liturgical, and Italian opera, and the theme tune) is equally delightful.There are very few things which I found less than satisfactory. Cage's Italian accent seems a little laboured. (I must applaud his musical skills here, though). John Hurt's rasping delivery has perhaps been a little over-used in recent years, so his portrayal of an irascible Greek doctor also struck me as slightly contrived.

One big fight and that's all... So is it maybe a subtle tale about occupation & resistance ? No luck... Troops are sunbathing, flirting and playing music... Would i tell more about that, my review would be politic and that's not the point...So, do the live locations of Kefalonia inspire vacations ? Well, the beach, mountains are beautiful and crystal-clear. Unfortunately, my way of life is so opposite that finally the island gave me cabin (or island) fever. On a small island, you can't run forever and i got the feeling of being stuck in the house or in the village or at the creek...Finally, is the love story is moving ? All the 3 actors are top: Bale is wild enough, Cage is totally credible in his music, and Cruz is funny with her accent. But my beliefs make ununderstable the fact that one actual love can vanish in front of another new one. So i don't really care about the events.In conclusion, i am not maybe the target for this movie and my negative review must be relativised.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
A decent movie about love during war,The movie looks beautiful and the story is very good. Perhaps the only unnecessary thing is the accent they adopt for this movie but it's not as bad as written in other reviews. Definitely worth watching.,7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Not terrible, but could have been better.",This film has received some patchy reviews and most of the criticisms are accurate - if perhaps a little over the top. As far as love stories go it is a little sallow. As far as war movies go it is somewhat irrelevant. But as a combined love in war movie you could do worse. The accents are somewhat annoying and occassionally distracting but with an ensemble cast that's always going to be a problem. Just sit back and enjoy and simple and harmless (relatively speaking) ride. My vote 6/10,6.0,Anonymous,Music
Completely Out of Tune with the Book,"In 4 words, Captain Corelli's Mandolin was ""completely out of tune"" with the book.  The novel provided sufficient character background to understand the relationships and personal challenges the characters needed to overcome; the script writer chose to ignore the details.  In ignoring them (e.g. the priest's role initially as a buffoon, but later as a spiritual leader, the fiancee's inability to read until taught by a socialist rebel, the bomb experts advice to Corelli and his eventual ironic demise), the story and characters fall flat.This was the first movie that I've ever walked out of midway through. Interesting cinematography, great actors do not MAKE a film; the story does.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Comparison,"Yes, in comparison to the novel on which it is based, 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' is not that good. But I think this is the point. Watching the film independently of the novel sees it as an okay film, while watching it when comparing it to the novel, allows subtle hints that occur within the novel. Certain character's motivations and events resonate for the reader, improving the film.However, despite John Hurt's ideal casting as Dr Iannis, the film is not that good. But when linking it to the novel, the novel appears better. Which is the way it should be. I don't personally believe you could capture the power of the novel in a film, but it tries, and to an extent, succeeds. But overall, the novel wins. This can only be a good thing.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Better Than What I Expected,"To be honest I wasn`t expecting much from this film and seeing as it gets off to such a slow start I thought my instincts were going to be proved right , but CAPTAIN CORRELLI`S MANDOLIN soon picks up and becomes an entertaining romantic drama set against the backdrop of the Second World War. I do have a beef with the  storyline though and seeing as it involves the central plot it`s quite a big beef: I found the romance between Corelli and Pelagia unconvincing . I don`t know if it`s the fault of the editing or the screen adaption ( I`ve never read the book ) but how did the romance come about ? Yeah Corelli is a likable cultured man but he`s still an Italian officer who`s taking part in the fascist occupation of Greece , he`s the enemy so why would a woman previously in love with a Greek patriot and partisan fall for him ? All this happens without any explanation and damages credibilty .",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Amazing Message for All,"I am a daughter of the war....and the message of this movie is simple. ""Love does not stop when there is war, nor should it.

Try it - then if YOU can manage it as well as Christian Bale then good for you.

Not since 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' have I felt cheated by the ending of a film.,"Everyone who has read Louis de Bernieres's fantastic book will agree that we have been deprived of a perfect ending to a perfect story, thus a great cinematic moment. Without the intended end I felt totally robbed.Many will say that it is not advisable to see the movie adaptation of a book one has enjoyed so, because one feels inevitably disappointed and 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' unfortunately doesn't escape this widely accepted truth. To cram such a rich book in two hours is admittedly no easy task and many incidental, yet succulent passages are bound to disappear; yet all controversial aspects have been deliberately erased.  All references to communism (Mandras joining the partisans is a significant theme in the book) or homosexuality (Carlo's love for Captain Corelli) have been omitted. This suggest the clear intend of the film makers: Making a commercially successful film at the expense of the story, and that is a real shame... but let's face it, isn't it what Hollywood has always done and continues to do even more: treating us like children who have to be shielded from potentially 'controversial' themes.Of course if one hasn't read the book, 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' is first class entertainment.The photography is glorious, the music superb (especially Pelagia's March) and the acting is quite impressive. No-one will deny that Nicolas Cage is a perfect Corelli, as well as John Hurt who makes a splendid Dr Iannis (even if he appears at time a bit too youthful at times). Penelope Cruz is simply radiant with beauty and strength. Given that most aspects surrounding Mandras are absent from the film, Christian Bale, sporting a very decent Greek accent, manages nonetheless to convey the great sense of loss his character suffers when Pelagia ceases to love him. In the book, Drosoula (played by Irene Papas) is supposed to be an ugly old hag which couldn't possibly qualify the amazingly youthful and energetic Papas who hasn't lost her magic touch. Only David Morrissey strikes a discordant note as Weber, the SS man. He sounds far too British and posh to be a convincing nazi.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
What a disappointment,I have to say that I thought this film was pretty dreadful - I knew the story from the book but of course realised that the film would not be the same - and boy it wasn't. The most interesting plotlines like the sacrifice of Carlo (which is key to the survival of Captain Corelli is glossed over as to be almost invisible - not by any chance to do with the fact that it was a gay subplot???) are missing. There doesn't seem to be much drama and also very little mandolin - I also have to say that I didn't think anyone's performance was good - the acting just came over as being very hammy. You'd also think from this film that the Italians were a nice bunch of lads basically on an army holiday - all they do is sing and dance. Weren't they a fascist army?? Hadn't they been involved in atrocities previously ? It would have been nice to have a more balanced view - the cynic in me would ask the question whether Hollywood was afraid of offending the Italian-American viewing public. All in all this film fails in practically every department - except the cinematography - Cephalonia looks fantastic.,2.0,Anonymous,Music
It's better than the reviews,"I will see anything with Nicolas Cage but do not always like his movies.  I had fairly low expectations for this one given the bad reviews but I really enjoyed it.  John Hurt was great.  The movie tries to combine humor with war, which was done so well in ""Life is Beautiful.""  It is difficult to do and this film pulls it off but awkwardly.  Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz were both good.  Everyone needs to lay off about the accents.",,Anonymous,Music
"Different to the Book, but still Attractive","Contains spoilersVictorian novelists frequently contrived implausibly happy endings to their stories in order to meet the expectations of their reading public. The classic example is Charles Dickens's decision to change the ending of 'Great Expectations' because his readers expected the novel to end with the marriage of Pip and Estella. The modern reading public, or at least those of sophisticated tastes, have been conditioned to regard happy endings as false and sentimental, so the modern author of literary fiction is under pressure to contrive implausibly unhappy endings, even to stories that would be improved by a happy one. I have always thought that Louis de Bernieres' otherwise excellent novel provides a good example of this phenomenon; just as its internal logic seems to be leading up to the union of Corelli and Pelagia, the author conjures up a bizarre set of circumstances to frustrate it. Unlike many of those who saw the film after reading the book, therefore, I have no problem with the fact that the filmmakers decided to reverse the novel's ending.The story is set on the Greek island of Cephalonia during the Second World War. Following the defeat of Greece, Cephalonia is occupied by a detachment of Italian troops. The main plot concerns a romance between the Italian Captain Corelli and Pelagia, the daughter of a local doctor. The first half of the film, which deals with this burgeoning love-affair, is fairly slow moving and gentle, at times even comical, in tone. The second half, however, contains more action and is darker in tone. The fall of Mussolini and the defection of Italy to the Allied side provoke a tragic confrontation between the Italian forces and their erstwhile German allies.Some simplification of such a complex novel is inevitable when it is transferred to the screen, but quite apart from the change in the film's ending, there were other changes to de Bernieres' plot that worked less well on screen. The main one concerned the character of the fisherman Mandras, Pelagia's former lover whom she jilts in favour of Corelli. In the book, Mandras is a largely unsympathetic character who becomes a fanatical Communist and turns into a violent and arrogant bully. In the film, he is shown as simple and uneducated, but brave and honourable, without ideological motivation except love of his country. The filmmakers do not seem to realize that this change also has implications for the way we see Pelagia. A woman who deserts a gallant resistance hero for an enemy of her country, even if that enemy is on a personal level a likable individual, makes an unlikely romantic heroine. The film is largely devoid of political content; it is perhaps a sign that the Cold War is well and truly over when Hollywood manages to remove the politics from one of the most anti-communist novels of recent times.The other change I did not like concerned Corelli's friend Carlo who dies saving his life. In the book, Carlo is a major character, but in the film he is a relatively minor one, and all reference to his homosexuality is removed. I felt that this spoil this part of the film, as Carlo's sexuality is important to an understanding of his character and of his motivation for saving Corelli. Another criticism I would have concerns the use of accents; all the actors, whether they were supposed to be playing Italians or Greeks, used virtually indistinguishable assumed 'continental' accents, which meant that it was difficult to differentiate between the two nationalities.Despite my criticisms, my overall impression of the film was a favorable one. With the exception of the miscast Nicholas Cage who seemed too old and insufficiently vivacious to fit my idea of Corelli, I felt all the main actors played their parts well. The film was visually very attractive, and the photography made good use of the beauty of the scenery of the Ionian islands. Although some of the deeper issues raised by the book have been removed, what remains is still an attractive love-story and in places a moving story of men at war. 7/10.A couple of goofs:- Rome fell to the Allies in 1944, not 1943 as stated in the film. Mussolini did not surrender to the British and Americans; the surrender was made by the new government of Marshal Badoglio, which was at the time holding Mussolini as a prisoner. I understand that in modern Greek the name Pelagia is pronounced, and more correctly transliterated, as 'Pelayia'; some of the actors used this pronunciation, but others pronounced it incorrectly with a hard 'g'.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Makes you hate war!,"I really enjoyed this movie. During the movie, I felt that I wanted Pelagia and Captain Corelli to get together. I heard myself screaming: Come on, kiss her! The movie has a happy ending. Good movie to watch in the evening when you want to chill.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Too long, too slow, too predictable. Not believable.","First, the good points.The photography is superb. Greece never looked this good. - Penelope Cruz. She is pretty, although nothing special.Now, the bad points.This film shows a total lack of respect for italian soldiers. If we were to believe what was depicted, those men were irresponsible drunks who would rather run away than defend their country. Also, germans are portrayed as lying weasels, not worthy of any trust.The storyline is simply not believable. It requires far too much reality stretching. For example, the italian soldiers are never into any trouble with the locals; it seems that they are not at war, but rather in some sort of vacation. Another good example: the german soliders order the italians to surrender their weapons; after a small fight, the italians prepare an attack that same night. While the germans were in town. Didn't anybody notice the huge cannons and mortars being loaded? Also, the scene where Corelli is shot at with dozens of automatic weapons. Another soldier protects him with his body, and he is saved. Next day, he is up and running as if nothing had happened. Too unbelievable.The continuity of the film suffers greatly because of the director's obsession with Nicholas Cage's eyes and Penélope Cruz' talent (?). There are various scenes that only show Cage for what seems like an eternity, and another where Cruz appears dancing. She is graceless, mixing Flamenco and Tango during the scene. And it drags too long. The entire movie is too long.Overall: too long, too pretentious, too unbelievable, and finally, too boring. It could have been a lot better.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
The film is a memorial too,"I have recently returned from a Holiday to Beautiful kefalonio and I have been there three times now. So on my return I decided to watch again the film version.I feel now that despite the bad miscasting the Director did his best with probably a limited budget and very little running time to go on. If the film had been any longer then maybe it would have been so much better characters more fleshed out or as the case maybe not dropped completely.Carlos the captains right hand man is in fact in love with Correlli.At only one point in the movie is this hinted at. Not so in the book, which makes more of Carlos's adoration and of course his final sacrifice when he saves the captains life by falling on him while being shot.While on the island on my last trip, I took a long walk towards Argostoli and came a across what looked like the remains of a cavern or quarry protected by a fence. Surrounding it either side was a stony wall.The farmer nearby mowing his field had left the gate unlocked and I walked in and stood at the edge looking down at a plaque on a wall with a bunch of flowers arranged by it. It was here on this spot that I realised 136 men of the Italian Acqui division were shot dead by the Nazis. The Greeks with respect, buried the Italians bodies at the same spot. I felt terrible knowing the view point I had was one that would have been seen by a German soldier as he looked down on these poor men as they were executed.So many tourists pass this peaceful little place without any idea of its tragic past.The film only portrays one of these terrible executions, but they took place all over the island of Kefalonio. The film and book reminds us that this terrible event should never be forgotten.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Cruze and Cage: wrong chemistry,"It's hard to pinpoint the reasons of the failure of Captain Corelli's Mandolin. Is it another good example of a how-to-cash-in-on-a-literary-success-and-do it-hastily-so-your-audience-is-hooked? Is it really what happened? The book is already a few years old, and it wasn't a Grisham after all. So what's or who's responsible for such a laughable result?One thing most of the critics rightfully pointed out: the language, or languages, of the film. On a remote Greek island invaded first by liberal (or inept) Italian soldiers then by a big bad German army, everybody speak English for the sake of the American audience who still feels deeply embarrassed when Nicholas Cage (seemingly speaking some Greek, we assume) is the go-between during a `surrender' ceremony: he reads the Greek text from the island official, translates it into Italian, I mean English, then goes get a German soldier who doesn't appear to be disturbed by any language barrier (actually, does the German soldier speak Italian, German or Greek: only his director could tell).The rhythm of the film gives you the feeling that we're dealing with several different stories seemingly directed by different people then spliced together by a team of editors who thought that adding a totally irrelevant earthquake at the end would move us For those of us still awake, it just confirmed that the filmmakers had no idea how to kill time. The evolving relationship between Cruze and Cage is so unrelated to the rest of the narrative that when you get back to the island and the existing conflicts, you feel you just visited another island for a few minutes. Cruze's fiancé, which should have a link between Cruze/Cage and war situation on the island is indeed poorly used, and we either don't care about him, or just find him superfluous.The filmmakers tried too hard at being politically correct and at satisfying their subtitle-haters American audience, and succeed at neither. They also attempted at chewing more than they and we can swallow: show side-by-side WWII and its geopolitical implication and a love story, all true stories. Titanic tried and made it, but we're not talking James Cameron here The narrative drifts from one focus to another, linking the two stories amateurishly, showing seemingly separate episodes without any warmth or talent, either from the cast or the production crew. The extreme violence of the last 30 minutes is so seems to be coming from left field, when compared with the rest of the film: the rhythm is totally off.The last meeting between our two love birds, reunion intended to be climatic and tearjearking, falls so flat that the word awkward comes to mind: Cage appears to be years older, but not Cruze. Maybe the filmmakers were looking, without any kind of focal point or heart, for a Hollywoodian ending, and, as a matter of consequence, the actors are gauche and clumsy and don't know what to do, and neither do we: should we ask for a refund?",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Passionate people lacking only passion,"How much spaghetti can one actor load up into his accent and still maintain his integrity? The answer is elusive, Nicholas cage went beyond the spaghetti test on this one, it was an embarrassment to listen to him. Next question, can one of the world's more beautiful women with lips the size of the state of Georgia actually carry off a young woman from remote Greek island? They got the hair right and the make up was good, but those lips, not in a million years of evolution would those lips be found on a Greek island in 1940. Too bad because Penelope Cruz was the best thing in the movie. She tried, almost everyone else was a two dimensional cutout, from the handsome fisherman turned resistance fighter (we know he is a leader because he has a beard) to the opera singing artillerymen of Corelli's battery (but they could sing!).So it is a love story, or so we are led to believe, but who is really in love here? and why? In concept I can believe that these two (Cage and Cruz) fall in love, but there is so little chemistry that it is fortunate that the good doctor is pushing the relationship (but why?).For 90 minutes pretty much nothing happens which may be a reflection of how exciting duty was in Greece for the Italian army, but the ten minutes of bloodshed that comes is so much counter to the story that it seems gratuitous (what can we do for the men in the audience, oh let's shoot some people and blow up stuff) then there is the ending, are they in love? You tell me. We have Italians and Greeks, the world's models for passionate people, and yet I hardly could feel a moment of real tenderness or joy (the one exception coming when Cruz is thrown into the water by her Greek fisherman boy friend.

"A mere shadow of the book, but still good","OK, so what really, really frustrates me about this movie is that it could actually have been great. Let me start by saying that the book engaged me to the point where I got so frustrated with the two central characters - Captain Corelli and Pelagia - that I actually hurled the book at the wall. Rarely has any book touched me so deeply. You really get to know and love the characters. Therefore, to try and incorporate the book into just over two hours is just insane, as for one thing, you don't get the scale of this love affair which goes on over decades. When I found out that Nic Cage was to play the Captain, I was thrilled. When I then found out that Christian Bale was to play Mandras, John Hurt to play Pelagia's father and David Morrissey to play Weber, I was ecstatic and couldn't wait for the film to be completed. Effectively, all the right ingredients were there for this to be a classic. When I subsequently went to see the film, I was underwhelmed, annoyed and disappointed. The film actually looks beautiful but it only has about half the story in it. The development of the Carlos' character is sadly lacking. Major liberties have been taken with some of the central events in the book. For me, this should have been at least 200 minutes long in order to adequately do justice to the book. A Greek tragedy but not in the right way.Postscript: September 27th, 2020. I have watched Penelope Cruz in many Pedro Almodovar movies - she is clearly a very talented actress whom the camera loves. I am all the more convinced that the biggest disaster about this film is that there was a perfect cast assembled. Whenever I think of this film, it is with a tinge of sadness. I feel sorry for the casting director, for the director himself, for the actors and for the photographer who produced such stunning cinematography. This could have been one of the greatest films in cinematic history and is worthy of a full investigative book. A really sad indictment of the Hollywood machine. I will stick to non-Hollywood movies from now on.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Give me a break!,"Although this movie is not out in the States yet I was able to catch it on a trip to London. I'm sorry, but I just could not get past Nicholas Cage with that horrible Italian accent and phony ""love of life"" demeanor. Penelope Cruz was great, as was John Hurt. These two are in a class far above Nicholas Cage who seems to be limited to action movie and the occasional chick flick. However, I have to say that Christian Bale stole the show. Especially bearing in mind that the leads were all playing characters of a different nationality than their own, Christian Bale was the only one who came across as convincingly Greek. In fact, I didn't even realize it was him at first despite having seen him in Metroland other films. The film was hardly as gripping or well-performed as the English Patient, which I think it pretends to. Why couldn't they have had Greek and Italian actors in the lead parts, speaking in their own languages (with the translation in subtitles)?? This movie was a sad day for Nicholas Cage and a sad day for fans of international films if this is the kind of Hollywoodization we can expect in the future.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Sweet like candy but no more than that  unmemorable,"Against her father's wishes Pelagia marries her fisherman fiancé just before he goes off to war. When she stops getting replies to her letters everyone fears the worst but she holds out hope that he is still alive. Meanwhile the Greek's initial defeat of the Italian army causes Hitler to support a full attack that leaves Greece and it's island inhabited by Italian soldiers. Pelagia and her father find themselves housing Italian Captain Corelli, who loves music and is charming. While Pelagia hates Italians and loves her husband she finds herself falling for the Captain over time.At the time of release there was plenty of dating couple who went to see this film and there was also a boost in the tourist trade in Greece, accompanied by lots of television travel programmes talking about the islands and the film. These two things were in my mind when I sat to watch the film tonight and I quickly understood why they were the case. Firstly the reason so many travel shows picked it up is because the film makes the place look great! Each shot is full of warm colour and the locations are picture-book all the way through. The idyllic feel that the location brings is also part of the wider film with a story that is sweet but high on Hollywood gloss. I have not read the book and have no intention of reading the book but I understand from other's comments that the screenplay has lost some 'difficult' elements and focused on the romance in the story. Ignoring this (as many who have not read the book will be able to) the film is just like the landscape  sweeping, easy on the eye, nice and ultimately quite unmemorable.This explains why it was a popular date movie or, to use that expression I generally dislike, chick-flick. The romance is simple and sweet and it is enjoyable on that level; I can't say it touched me on a deep level (or any level) but it was sweet and I quite liked it. Towards the end it gets harder and more about the war than the romance but I felt this was too sudden a change that had been left too late in the game to fully work  it was too much of a sea change for me to fully go with it.The cast are mostly pretty and OK just like the landscape. Cage is too nice to be true but still tries hard; his Italian accent has corny 'mama-mia' moments but is generally OK. Cruz is fairly bland and doesn't bring a great deal to the film other that her looks (which personally don't appeal to me that much) and Christian Bale is given little to do considering how good an actor he is generally. Hurt is good value as always and the support cast fill in the gaps well even if few of them have anything approaching what could be called a character.Overall this is a sweet film that turns bitter for the final quarter of it's running time  a change in mood that is quite difficult when it occurs due to it's suddenness. However it manages to stay quite sweet and romantic despite running with a simplified script and a glossy approach to everything. It is quite unmemorable and I doubt I shall ever watch it again but I found it to be like the landscape  easy on the eye and rather pleasing to watch without touching me on more than a superficial level.",,Anonymous,Music
"Actor John Hurt, Cinematographer John Toll lift up the film","The movie is a tolerably good love story to watch.However, John Hurt (Dr Iannis) lifts the film from sinking into mediocrity, even though much of his face is hidden behind a thick moustache. Hurt commands attention with subtle expressions, not overacting as other actors are prone to do.John Toll's camerawork may not match up to his work in ""The Thin Red Line"" but his flashes of brilliance are just breathtaking. One shot that bore his stamp was the profile of Cruz and her Greek boyfriend taken with no light falling in them, but with the light in the background. Toll and Sven Nykvist (The Seventh Seal) have much in common. Both are great cinematographers.Irene Papas' character never developed--what a waste of good talent--thanks to the lackluster script.The music is neither bad nor uplifting--one expected much more in a film with a musical instrument in the title.All in all the movie only proves that John Madden is not a top rung director; yet his choice of actors and crew is commendable.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

A real let down,"Luckily for me I have not got round to reading the literature upon which this movie is supposedly based on. I say luckily because my opinion on the film would probably have been far more harsh than the one I have at the moment. The problem with the film is that it just doesn't seem to want to do anything for itself. It is more than content with simply letting the camera rove around the spectacular scenery. Don't get me wrong it is breath-taking to watch some beautiful things, but if I wanted to see that  and that only I would watch the discovery channel or holiday programmes.John Madden had promised so much from his recent efforts, and had showed his audience that he was more than capable of handling drama in such a way as to make us care about the characters. However, this just isn't possible. Maybe there is something wrong with the script, because there is so little dialogue that sticks out. Maybe there was some concern from the studio as to the length of the film, it certainly feels as though it has had huge chunks taken away from it, because no studio in the world would let such a shallow piece of writing be made.One almost feels as though the spectacle of the novel and its success may well have been enough to secure money, and a big box office, and so the writing of dialogue took second place to everything else. I mean look at the cast that they were able to secure, Cage, Bale, Hurt, Cruz, four actors whose most recent films have made them A-list quality. It has all the ingredients to be a film remembered and admired.The cast though is, mostly dreadful. Nicolas Cage, who is said to have Italian decendancy is mocking in his performance and although he tries to shape off this loveable nonchalant man, the accent simply makes him look mugging. Penelope Cruz walks around for two hours pouting and refusing to drop the accent which is here forte. Hurt gives a solid performance though and Bale continues to play good supporting roles.The films biggest pratfall though is its confusion to let the audience know what it is actually trying to tell us. There is, what feels like, a love story but why is there love. There is no occasions upon which any chemistry happens, nor incidents which would make two people love each other, only once does he play the mandolin for her. There is also the war story which takes up half of the film and really makes you empathise with Correlis plight but that soon wilts away as the love story comes back. It would have been predictable had the film had any direction, but by never finsihing anything it starts and by leaving the audience asking why it simply fizzles out.Readers of the book will probably say 'its not the book, but it is still brilliant' but the fact is that book or not, it is a badly acted film which is unsure of what it is functioning as love story/ war movie/ moral tale/ national pride.

Total Disappointment!,"The book was one of the greatest, if not the greatest book I have ever read. I wasn't expecting the movie to live up to all of my expectations from the book, but some would have been nice.  The movie was rushed in the beginning, poorly introducing the characters.  There is no real explanation as to why the Italians are invading (the book goes into impressive detail about the Italians invasion which was an important element in the story).  Characters roles in the story completely change, many of them losing their charm.You will be disappointed by this film.  Penelope Cruz' acting is truly pathetic, and I am not one of those that dislikes her.  I have comments here where people are stating that this is her finest work (Go see Todo sobre mi madre, this is NOT it).

But for one dreaming of true life, with it's bad and it's good things, all wrapped up in a realistic cover, than it is sure you've found the place, when going to Captain Corelli's Mandolin. Seeing almost all of this year's love movies (what came into our theaters) I can say this is second best after Moulin Rouge. The story is simpler but it's not a fairy tale. One could easily think this really happened, almost 65 years ago. I felt every moment of the Italian soldiers murder..and I did regret as much the fact that the german captain did not commit suicide. It was the only thing honorable to do. But he didn't do it.. as it was war..and no honor came before glory. Again a very good movie coming from the director of Shakespeare in love.

the story is very predictable...,"Set during WWII on a Greek island, a small town doctor (Hurt) is training his beautiful daughter (Cruz), to become a doctor as well. Cruz is in love with a local fisherman (Bale) and wishes to marry him against her fathers will. Then the war comes to the island and Bale decides to head out to fight the Italians and the Germans. Before he leaves he engages to Cruz. The island then gets occupied by the German allies, the Italian. This is were Captain Corelli arrives (Cage) with his mandolin, and falls in love with Cruz. From here on the story is very predictable and the script is terrible. Adding to a bunch of clichees and ludicrous lines, comes Cage's horrible accent and his awful character makes it hard to believe that anyone would fall in love with him. At times I thought it all was attended to be a comedy, but apparently not, and I found this film to be boring and little giving.

But at a certain point the plot completely moves away from the one in the book.Mandras' character is completely different - Corelli's friend Carlo is neglected - The faked accent of Nicholas Cage is completely unnecessary and ridiculous - Pelagia's father's fate is adapted - the ending is completely re-arrangedTherefore, the film should have a different name not to confuse the audience with the book with the same name.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

Once it starts building, you will stay glued to the screen. It has several twist and turns and the war details are poignant. The movie's previews may be a little misleading in leading you to believe the movie is mainly coverage on WW2; however, this is more a love story and an exhilarating one at that.

Cage's accent must have been bought out of a speghetti sauce box,thats how bad it stunk.Not mentioning the fact that he didn't even belong in the movie.Not that I dislike Cage,he is a good actor just wasn't meant for this movie. Bale played a Excellent role great acting and good accent.I was actually quite shocked to see him in the movie because I never saw him in any of the advertisements for the movie and he turned out to be the only good part in the entire movie.For all you people who said his accent stunk..Maybe you are Greek or something,but this movie was meant for an American audience and as an American I think he did a very good job with the accent..

A wonderfull film,"Ok I admit it! I have never read or even heard of the book, until II found it on one of the studio web sites. The Story follows three people.

First Pelagia's betrothed goes off to fight with the Greek army, Then the German military with their Allies take over the island. After writing so many letters Pelagia assumes her betrothed is dead. Without realizing it she falls in love with the handsome Captain who is billeted in the Doctors home.

Italian Captain Antonio Corelli (Nicolas Cage) and his men never fire a shot. Mandras returns terribly injured and then joins the partisans. Despite initial hatred, Pelagia falls for Corelli and his mandolin. Captain Günther Weber (David Morrissey) is the awkward German trying to befriend Corelli.

One More Good Book Ruined by Hollywood,"First, let me say that my experience was tainted. We went to a United Artists theatre in Denver to see this film. The sound was so low it was almost inaudible from the very beginning of the movie. I went out after the first five minutes and told one of the ushers about the problem, and he said he would tell one of the managers. 90 minutes later, they final got the volume turned up, so we could hear the last 30 minutes of the movie. I tracked down the managers on duty after the movie to complain. They couldn't have cared less, and were more interested in talking to each other. Luckily, UA has a 100% customer satisfaction guarantee. When I went to the ticket booth to get my money back, the clerk didn't care why I wanted it back, but told me to just sign the request, and then she gave me the refund. With people like this working for UA, it's no wonder they went bankrupt. Unbelievable.Now to the movie. Let's face it. This movie stunk. It was slow to develop, miscast, the characters were one dimensional, and they missed the whole point about the mistakes we make in life that was so eloquently delivered in Louis de Bernières powerful story. I think the only ones you can blame for this are the producers and the screenwriter, Shawn Slovo. What did she do, read the Cliff's Notes? How disappointing. It's just like what Hollywood did to Bryce Courtenay's wonderful ""Power of One"". Don't these people read the books before they write the screeplay? Pray that Hollywood doesn't try to make a movie out of de Bernières's first three hilarious books.I've decided that I just won't go to movies where I've already read the story.

"Less than great, a whole lot less than exceptable also","John Madden's Captain Corelli's Mandolin is a film which lags and sags, and it is pretty pathetic at times.  Some lush settings and John Hurt don't make up for inane dialogue, and braindead performances.Penelope Cruz lives on a island that has been pretty secluded since, oh I'd guess since the dawn of time?  Ok, not the greatest sarcasm.  Anyway, she has a fiance, played by Christian Bale who doesn't really fit the role of a greece type of person unfortunately, and she will marry him as soon as he comes back from the war.  But while he's away, the Italians come in to the island and it should seem that her world might seem normal anyway.  But then her father, played by Hurt who is the only watchable guy in the movie, lets an Italian Opera soldier (is that what you'd call this contradiction of a man) played by Nicolas cage with Italian accent and all, inter her home. And I don't think I need to go any further, not because it's unthinkable, but because I don't want to drone on with the obvious plot points.Not reccomendable, unless you are a really die-hard fan of Madden's last film Shakespeare in Love (which I felt was ludicrous when it came time to the Oscars) or the novel it's based on.  C-",4.0,Anonymous,Music
A fine film in its own right,"This is a beautifully-crafted, emotion-packed testament to the horrors of war and the power of love. Its accuracy as regards the actual WW2 occupation of Cephalonia by the Italians and Germans, and its fidelity to the novel on which it is based, are neither here nor there. As a movie, it is completely successful on its own terms, which are old fashioned enough to include a linear story line and straightforward characterisations and relationships.The central love story is a take on Romeo and Juliet, neatly fitting in with the fact that director, John Madden, made Shakespeare in Love, also based on a star-crossed lovers theme. The magnificent Cephalonian scenery also brings to mind ancient Greek drama, and its constant theme of man against the fates, so it may be significant that Madden also directed one of the episodes of a 1990 TV series on Greek Myths (with acknowledgements to IMDb!). But, since we're now in the sphere of  commercial cinema, not classical tragedy, the film has a happy ending, though this is muted and well judged in tone.Almost all the performances are thoroughly convincing, especially John Hurt as Dr Iannis, and Penelope Cruz as Pelagia. Nicolas Cage is also effective as Corelli, though his earnest passionate persona may not be sufficiently stereotypically Italian for some people's taste. Particularly believable is Christian Bale as Pelagia's brave, but insensitive, fiancé, Mandras. The production values are high grade, including the music and effects. In particular, the battle and massacre scenes are graphically realistic and truly shocking.To sum up, this is an excellent movie, with much to admire, and very little to dislike.",,Anonymous,Music
"Oh, my","When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I was under the impression that Nicolas Cage's character was an American soldier, and that Penelope Cruz was the Italian. This was thought because of Cage's horrific attempt at an Italian accent with the line ""Bella bambina at 12 o'clock"" (or something like that). I assumed he was trying to fake an accent to be silly as he was marching around what I thought was Italy. The accents were horrible, and as always, Penelope Cruz sounds like a squeaky chihuahua trying to squeeze out her lines. And lets not forget about Christian Bales accent, wow, sounded like he was trying to speak through a ball of cotton stuffed in his mouth. And if the accents weren't bad enough, during the love scene between Cage and Cruz, you get a glimpse of pit hair from not Cage, but Cruz! Maybe that was the norm for women in Greece back then, but that's not what just doesn't fly in a love scene these days.

"Let down badly by the words, enriched by the images","Alfred Hitchcock used to say that the sight of people in Paris (or Moscow, or Kefallonia) talking amongst themselves in English, was all by itself enough to ruin a movie.  Okay, so Hitchcock was a bit loopy.  But such things can happen.  The way everyone in ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin"" speaks English - the Greeks with a Greek accent, the Italians with an Italian accent, the Germans with a German accent, the BBC newsman with a BBC accent - seriously undermines the credibility of every scene, and brings outright idiocies in its wake.  It's fair enough, sometimes, to let English stand in for some other language.  But EVERY other language?  Details are obscured: is Captain Corelli bilingual, trilingual (he converses with Germans, but in what tongue? this is an important issue), or can he only speak Italian?  How many languages can the average islander speak?  How many languages can the average Italian private speak?  Is there an accepted lingua franca on the island, and if so, what is it?  It's as if everyone is speaking not Italian or Greek or German but European, a language with slightly different regional variants.  Every single person we see speaks this English-as-a-second-language with precisely the same degree of  proficiency - although Nicholas Cage will every so often utter a word like ""signora"" or ""bella"", to confuse matters further.So the absence of subtitled Greek, Italian etc. is a real problem, accounting for all that is seriously wrong with the film - ALL that is seriously wrong, mind you, which is why I resent people talking about the film as though it were a disaster (those who have acquired an irrational hatred of Miramax are especially fond of doing so), when it is at worst a pleasant outing, with much to recommend it.  Cinematography is gorgeous. The island is gorgeous.  People look as though they really live there. (John Tool's photography is EXACTLY the kind of thing Peter Jackson ought to have tried for when he made ""The Fellowship of the Ring"".  The fact that the latter was showered with praise and awards while the former merely got a few half-hearted compliments shows just how little respect Tolkeinesque fantasy is accorded.  People EXPECT a World War Two story set on a Greek island to look superb.  With fantasy, we're delighted if only it fails to look embarrassingly bad, sometimes even if it doesn't.  But I digress.)  There are one or two - okay, considerably more than one or two - lines that are just too obvious and pat, but usually contained within scenes that are somehow strong enough to bear them.  The story as a whole is an engaging one.  The bit with the sea mine is surely worthwhile.No worse than mediocre in other respects, it's worth seeing simply because it's worth SEEING.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Disappointing, but definitely watchable","If you haven't read the book, I recommend you do so, it was truly beautiful, heart-breaking, funny, incredibly romantic and had interesting characters and left vivid imagery in your head. This film from Shakespeare in Love director John Madden is definitely watchable, but it was also a disappointment.Starting with the good things, the scenery, costumes and cinematography are absolutely breathtaking. On top of that the score is absolutely marvellous, Madden's direction is pretty good-though he has directed better especially with the Inspector Morse episodes he directed- and the story is a beautiful and interesting one, with some sweet, funny and touching moments.In terms of acting, it is a mixed bag really. Christian Bale does well with a character that could have done with more development, while John Hurt is even better, Hurt is a brilliant and underrated actor, and playing one of the more intriguing characters he is wonderfully dignified. However, Nicolas Cage is a miscast unfortunately-right, I have nothing against Cage, he has been in some good films and has given some good performances but he has also been very inconsistent. While his role here is not his worst film role(ie. his role in The Wicker Man remake was much worse), his character felt somewhat cartoony complete with an accent that didn't really work as it feels overdone. Penelope Cruz is better though, I did have a problem with her accent (too Spanish for my liking), she does have a nice character to work with and looks amazing.While the acting was a mixed bag and the score and scenery amazing, there are several flaws that stop Captain Corelli's Mandolin from being better than it was. Other reviewers have commented on its resemblance to the book(or lack of it), but there were other things wrong that were more significant to me. Also the book, while wonderful, is quite an ambitious one to bring to screen and I do accept that it wasn't 100% faithful(there have been films that try to do that and don't quite work as a consequence), so while I applaud the film for adapting it it could have been better. The pacing is very languid so the film takes a while to get going, until the final battle segment which felt rushed, while the dialogue is on the sappy side of things. Then there are characters that feel sketched over, I was too disappointed at how Carlo was treated, while some of the secondary characters are rather clichéd and perhaps stereotypical.Overall, disappointing but definitely watching for the scenery, Hurt and music especially. 5.5/10 Bethany Cox",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Arts and Ways of Healing,"Sandwiching a love story between Pelagia (Penelope Cruz) and Captain Antonio Corelli (Nicolas Cage), Pelegia's father-physician (John Hurt) removes an ear blockage from a patient at the movie's beginning and is asked to replace it at the end. In between is a cinematic lesson, reportedly unfaithful to the novel and somewhat to historical fact, that says the most about the arts and ways of healing as any movie I've happened across since reading Albert Camus' The Plague.Captain Corelli's Mandolin opens in 1940 on the island of Cephallonia. When the Germans trump a Greek military victory (elsewhere) over the forces of Mussolini, an occupying force of battle-unsullied Italians arrives to incur the contempt and detestation of the locals. What follows is a transnational tension that gradually becomes a reevaluation, both among the populace generally and in the heart that resides in the female leading character, a daughter-doctor in training.Hurt should be nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as a physician of body, soul, and ethics. He probably ought to win, pending a look at other prospective candidates. Cruz shines in a pair of scenes where she speaks not a line but reacts by purest facial language to that which she feels obligated to despise yet cannot because of its gentility. Cage likewise gives a wholly acceptable performance, and Piero Maggio in a minor role is even better as the one Italian who is a survivor of the prelude carnage. David Morrissey plays with skill a stiff German liaison officer who takes a liking to the Italians' frivolity. Bale balances carefully his character's simultaneous patriotism and romantic plight. Irene Papas is capably present as his mother.This film is getting reviews of mediocrity and badness from many critics. Romantics are advised to ignore them. In my mind it's an IMDb 7, or in customary ratings lingo, against the grain, at least 3 stars. Bright stars, at that, lighting the stage of an unusually medicinal Greek tragedy.",,Anonymous,Music
The love aspect of it was lame along with the approach,"(2001) Captain Corelli's Mandolin
ROMANTIC DRAMA/ WARBased on the novel written by Louis de Bernières, which takes place sometime during WWII, starring Nicolas Cage as Italian Captain, Antonio Corelli, who under Mussolini rule was ordered to settle on a Greek island. And although, Pelagia (Penélope Cruz) was already engaged to a local Greek soldier, she eventually falls for Antonio. There's no new surprises, except to say that it's nice to see that, although there were also Italians and Germans residing on the Greek island, how convenient it was to see that everyone understood each other because everyone was speaking English, unlike on some action Chinese movies like on some Jackie Chan films, some critics cannot accept the fact that different languages were being spoken, and that the central character may understand what they were talking about.

"Photography, music and battle scene save the day","Penélope Cruz just laps up the camera from every angle; those deep Spanish eyes and that so sweet face, and long dark hair compete with the breath-taking scenery of the Greek island. But from there to being a competent actress leaves somewhat to be desired, though there were some intense moments of interpretation here and there. Nicolas Cage is well able to carry out dramatic rolls (Leaving Las Vegas, qv) but it would seem that in this film he was either a little uninspired or bewitched by the Enchantress, or simply the chemistry just did not nucleate into anything worthy of such an evidently intense story-line. One just did not feel great things for them; indeed one felt a bit sorry that Mandras (Christian Bale) got shoved to one side, though he also did not come up to great expectations but appeared a little more authentically cast. Ever since `Empire of the Sun' I have been anxiously awaiting excellent parts from Bale; am still waiting. However, the battle scene in the village was excellently done, comparable to the best of Spielberg. Beautiful photography from John Toll, as near as good as in `Braveheart'. The music is also worth mentioning: Stephen Warbeck has done his homework and synchronised well with the mood of the film. The Italian soldiers singing extracts from Verdi and Puccini was good fun, and some moments of Captain Corelli playing his mandolin were even poignant. Whether Cage was really playing the instrument or only miming he did it very well. All in all, an interesting couple of hours in which the leading actors did not come up to much, though the supporting cast were mostly fine.

"Loved the story BUT, it took me 3 attempts to get through it all","Okay, I finally just got through the whole thing. I wanted to see this movie because I knew it had musical connotations and was about being in love with Penelope Cruz. Which isn't hard to do.When there is a good script and good story you would think that ""top"" actors like Nic Cage and Christian Bale would seriously buff up on their local talk. If you are going to do a foreign movie in English with an accent of the local language then you got some serious work to do. Nic apparently didn't do enough training for his accent. He goes from one sentence saying something like: hey man, surfs up dude!, to aye mama mia, no hay pizzaria. If you pay attention to his accent it is all over the place.If you watch an A actor like Leo Dicaprio, he will seriously study the local vernacular and slang and bring it into his character and make the audience believe it. Look at his accents in Blood Diamond or Gangs of New York. He nails it. These two guys Nic and Christian completely blow it. It gets better towards the end of the film but come on guys, do your homework. Jeezus, it is so distracting and hard to get into a movie where the characters have clearly not done their homework.My overall feeling about this movie is very conflicted. I loved the story and loved the classical guitar piece that Nics' character recorded but, the accent thing I obviously cannot ignore. They should have done this movie with real Italians, Spaniards, and Germans and kept it real, or otherwise brought in an actor that does his homework like Leo Dicaprio. So there..

I do think that the movie could have been expanded to develop the story more fully.The Greek people are warm and loving, the Italian soldiers are fun- loving and laid back and the Germans were as you'd expect them to be except for the officer who accepts the surrender of the town's mayor who would rather surrender to the German's dog than to an Italian.This is not a story for younger moviegoers but I believe that adults will enjoy it very much.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Because it kills what otherwise might be a pretty good period piece.",,Anonymous,Music
Avoid if you want to spend better your time,"Ambitious movie, it ends on a poetic miserable and full of stereotypes vision typical of a Hollywood brain that looks at and judges while ignoring completely European world: despite the war they are living Italians are seen as idiot pricks always ready to sing as jesters in the bar, while the captain has his head into pussy rather than the fate of his soldiers; poor Germans then are the eternal bad guys, that even if motivated by a flash of humanity or living passion, as in the case of the captain, remain those cold like robotic thinking- machines unable to love or feel ... Well! maybe the intent was to obtain atmospheres or emotions like in ""Mediterrano"", but Salvatores is something else. Director should change job, loss of time !",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Corelli's All At Sea!,"The first of this year's blockbusters is a major disappointment. The main problems with the film are the dubious accents of all the main actors and the complete lack of on-screen chemistry between the lovers, Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz. The only person to come out of this sorry mess with some sort of credibility is John Hurt.Nicolas Cage is completely miscast as Captain Corelli. Penelope Cruz is a fine actress but is not called upon to do much here except look enchanting and vulnerable, which as you would expect she does with ease. Let's hope that she doesn't foresake her film career in Spain where she has had considerable success, for the bright lights of Hollywood.I haven't read the book so I am unable to make any comparisons with the film, but I guess that those people who have will be in for a shock.The film does have one good thing going for it and that is the photography which is stunning.The Greek Tourist Industry will be anticipating a rush on holidays to it's islands this summer.The film will do well at the Box Office due mainly to the usual Hollywood Hype, but it remains to be seen if this can be sustained once ""word of mouth"" gets around.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
"If you don't expect the book, you will love this film","I have seen Captain Corelli's Mandolin a number of times now. I read the book, and loved it. I really enjoyed this film. Nicolas Cage was well cast as Capt. Antonio Corelli, Penelope Cruz excellent as Pelagia. John Hurt - fantastic performance. From the very first minute of the film, I am engrossed. It is amazing how much of this film is direct from the book... Nicolas Cage plays an amazing Italian Captain, who's first love is music. He is thrust into a situation beyond his control, and he lives his new life as best he can, using his love of music and culture to bring some sensibility to a confused world. In Penelope Cruz's Pelagia we see an intelligent girl, brought up by her father, to a cultured world of languages and knowledge. She is betrothed to Mandras, a local fisherman; and we see her pain and confusion as she encounters Captain Corelli. Well played, well cast, and an enjoyable film. Watch it, but forget that you read the book before you see it.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
The Best Movie of the Year!,"My names Daniel and I'm 15 years old. I go to the theaters at least once a week. Friday I saw Rat Race, which was just a fun movie to go to to laugh a few times. Then Sunday, today, I went to see Captain Corelli's Mandolin. It was fantastic. I have been waiting for an Oscar caliber movie to come out all year, and I think this qualifies.  My favorites of the year before this were Finding Forrester, AI, and The Others. They were all very good movies, but I think that this one was great. The music was awesome, the acting was great, the cinematography was beautiful. It was very well made. I loved it. Go see this movie, unless your the type that would find it boring, but it is a wonderful movie and I think it should win some Oscars. Go see it! I give this movie an A- or maybe even an A.

Romantic powerful war tragedy,"Romance combined with the horrors of war, this film keeps you interested, whilst offering plenty of suspense, some laughs, and some tears.  A good story line with strong characters.  This film was thoroughly enjoyable and would suit a wide range of audiences. The language, however, should have been in Greek with English sub-titles since it was filmed in the beautiful island of Kefalonia, and all the villages on the island were partly filmed, there should have been a lot more emphasis on the hardships that the locals had to endeavour.  The film did not portray this, but used a softly softly approach to hide the evils and the real tragedies  that did happen during those times.  All in all the total film did have interest as well as intrigue and stimulation.  I would recommend it to viewers who would be interested to know about the history of this lovely Greek island.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
The melody of the Mandoline and the Greek Muse,"What I enjoyed most in this film was the scenery of Corfu, being Greek I adore my country and I liked the flattering director's point of view. Based on a true story during the years when Greece was struggling to stand on her own two feet through war, Nazis and hardship. An Italian soldier and a Greek girl fall in love but the times are hard and they have a lot of sacrifices to make. Nicholas Cage looking great in a uniform gives a passionate account of this unfulfilled (in the beginning) love. I adored Christian Bale playing Mandras the heroine's husband-to-be, he looks very very good as a Greek, his personality matched the one of the Greek patriot! A true fighter in there, or what! One of the movies I would like to buy and keep it in my collection...for ever!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Not for dimwits.,"I was pleasantly entertained for the afternoon. I really liked how they drew you into the characters and the war. It developed. It was intelligent.

Brilliant-not the book!!!,"'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' is a fantastic film in itself. It is nothing like the book, which may disapoint its ardent followers. Yet, viewed on it's own, the film is a masterpiece. The views are spectacular and the acting isn't too bad either!! Nicolas Cage was brilliant-so different from his usual action hero type characters. Penelope cruz is superb and really holds the film together. I think that this film has to be judged as an indivdual project-not related to the book. Louis de Bernieres gave up rights to the film script, so the film is an interpretation of the director, john maddon. Go and see this film with an open mind-you'll love it; because underneath is the touching story of love and war.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

War romance on Cephallonia: place of an Italian massacre,"This movie is about a war romance between captain Corelli, an Italian artillery officer and a Greek local beauty called Pelagia during the summer and fall of 1943 on the Greek island of Cephallonia. The occupying Italian garrison behaves as friendly as possible to the local population, while the superior feeling Germans keep distance. Corelli is instantly charmed by Pelagia and tries to win her heart by playing on his mandoline.The movie portrays quite historical the way to disaster of the 12.000 strong Italian Acqui Division and its East-front battle hardened commander general Gandin. In September 1943 Italy surrendered. Contradictionary orders from Rome and Athens to lay down arms and hostile reactions by the Germans, made the confused Italians to decide to took up their arms against their former allies. They sank a German landing ship with reinforcements for the small German garrison. Supported by Stuka's and Jagdpanzer the ""elite"" 1st Gebirgsjäger Division is transferred to the island and in a few days killed 1300 Italian troops, loosing only 200 men of their own. On 21 September the Italians were forced to surrendered and 5300 were instantly shot, including Gandin. Hitler himself personally ordered the ""destruction"" of the ""traitors"". The tragedy for the remaining Italians was not over because of the captured remaining Italians another 3000 lost their lives when their transports were sunk. The movie shows us a glance of this immense tragedy and proceeds with the escape of captain Corelli and his return to the island after the war. He meets Pelagia in the ruins of their house, destroyed by an earthquake. The movie starts and ends with showing us the simple local people and their daily problems. The war and the tragedy of the Italians seems to be totally forgotten.(note: ironically most survivors of the surrendered 1st Mountain Division were shot themselves by the Yugoslav Army in 1945).",8.0,Anonymous,Music

"If You Compare This to the Book, You Will Be Hugely Disappointed","As a Standalone Film: 8/10Having read the novel, this film was disappointing to say the least. However, if you haven't read the book, Captain Corelli's Mandolin can really be appreciated as a great film.I was certainly hesitant to accept Cage as the lead character, but all credit to him, his performance was superb. Overall the cast is brilliant, Hurt, Crews and Bale all doing brilliantly and having impressive accents to boot. The setting is obviously beautiful, and the attention to detail doesn't go unnoticed.As a standalone, it is a great film, and the story builds well, yet it does so far too quickly. The film could have easily been an hour longer, creating the atmosphere in which the island found itself in, and really fleshing out the inner workings of key characters, but it is too rushed. This is particularly the case in the opening stages of the film, and you aren't given enough of a chance to connect to characters.It gives a loose and vague representation of Kefalonia under occupation, but any historical accuracy must be taken with a handful of salt. Towards the climax, Hollywood events tend to take place instead of accurate history.As a Representation of the Novel: 5/10The beginnings of this film stay true to the novel, important chapters play out, but ultimately they are rushed through and it feels like half the book is lost in a matter of seconds. All the incredible build up and backstory written is lost.As the film enters it's middle, it entirely loses the plot. What the hell is going on with it? The lack of attention to some characters accumulates into a completely new story focusing far too much on Corelli's movements and introducing a version of Mandras. Towards the end, the film and novel align briefly, before it takes a new route once more. Some of these new sections are entirely unnecessary too; a major focal point in Kefalonian history is the 1953 earthquake, bringing it forwards several years just makes no sense and adds nothing.The biggest injustice of this adaptation is the portrayal of Mandras. Every ounce of his development and deterioration is omitted, his gripping backstory stripped, his character entirely removed. It's a great shame because in the early stages, Bale does a brilliant job as Mandras. However, it's clear early on, as significant scenes are rushed through, that he does not play the part in the story he should.Furthermore, several key characters are completely overlooked and omitted in the film. Carlo manages maybe two lines, and his heavy backstory and struggles are left out. This takes away all the impact that his actions have in the story. Bunny is none existent, as is Alekos, and Drosoula and Velisarios are nothing but extras. Plus, all the feeling of Weber is unspoken, and his turmoil is lost through simple scenes.The whole film lacks the power of the book, and the historical and political context. It's a shame that a great cast was not brought more closely in line with the original plot, perhaps a series could be appreciated in the future as the depth of the story could be allowed to play out.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

A classic love story set against WWII,"The majority of the criticism that I had heard about this film related to the picture postcard location and the 'silly accents'. I have not read the book, yet! The accents were appropriate.The film opens on the Island of Cephalonia just before the outbreak of the second World War. Pelagia, the daughter of Iannis, the island's doctor becomes engaged to Mandras, a fisherman. Her father does not think that this is a good match but allows Pelagia to make her own choice. Mandras goes to fight the Italians. The war takes a turn for the worse and the island is invaded by the Italians with German support.The war does not really touch those that are based there. During this time a tentative romance develops between Pelagia and Corelli. After the Italians surrender the Germans massacre them. Some escape, Corelli amongst them. He is smuggled off of the island by Mandras and his partisans.The war ends and Pelagia is now a doctor. However, she still carries a torch for Corelli. Iannis writes to Corelli who returns and wins back Pelagia.The film does jump a little, but this is to be expected of a film based on a sweeping BOOK. This said, this does not spoil the FILM. The locations are beautiful, this cannot be helped either since the island is beautiful. This works as a romance which is what it is. The performances from the central characters, Cage and Cruz are good and make the story believable, I can forgive her the dire Woman On Top. Hurt provides a strong performance also. Bale is good in support.This is one to go and see and judge for yourself.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

"It's Entertainment, People!","In reading movie reviews over the last year or so on Imdb, I am astounded at the negative feedback of so many viewers. Captai Corelli's Mandolin was not a great movie but it was a good movie. I was beautifully filmed and the story was decent. I did find the various accents slightly distracting. Penelope Cruz's character could have been played better by many other actresses better. Nicholas Cage never disappoints. I am going to read the book, and am certain it will be excellent. But I know that a movie can NEVER live up to the images created in the minds of its book readers. You can't expect that any movie could live up to that. I also frown upon people expecting that Hollywood is going to give an accurate portrayal of history. That does not sell tickets. Perhaps we should learn about history from real sources such as history books or documentaries. If you go to a movie, any movie, with any more expectations than being entertained, you will always be disappointed. On rare occasions you will be greatly suprised.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Well worth it,"Lots of criticism have been heaped upon Captain Corelli's Mandolin. After having seen it myself, I'm rather positive myself about the movie. The beginning was rather slow and a little bit too sweet - the blooming romance between Pelagia and Mandras didn't convince me.After history comes booming in, the tone of the movie changes dramatically. First of all, as an historian I have to give a lot of kudo's on the movie makers themselves for the virtually flawless depiction of WW2 Italian soldiers at war, and the same goes for the depiction of 1944 German soldiers, correctly dressed with mixed European and Afrika Korps uniforms. The researchers finally have done a very fine job on getting the uniforms and military settings right, unlike American ""war"" horror movies like The Guns from Navarone and Where Eagles Dare, where terrible mistakes in the composition of German military uniforms regularly spoil my appetite.A frequent criticism I've picked up is about the overacting of Nicholas Cage c.s. in their Italian soldiers' roles, with their opera singing and so on. I have to counter this strongly. As a Latin myself with ample knowledge of the Italian participation in WW2, I state that Italian soldiers often behaved like that, and not only them. For those interested, I strongly recommend the reading of all six parts of Spike Milligan's wartime memories, to see that peacetime overacting very often equates to wartime normal acting. I was sorry that Nicholas Cage, or Nicholas Coppola as he is in fact called, didn't work more on his Italian and retained his American twang throughout the movie, but whatever. Specially as the movie went on, he became more and more convincing as the theatrical artillery captain in the royal Italian army. And as for the actual historical framework depicted in the movie, I was fairly satisfied. I even noticed that history is in fact more accurately depicted in the movie than in the book!About the storyline itself. Cage was a little bit ""less himself"", kind of subdued, very uncommon for him as an actor. John Hurt was rather convincing, as were most of the cast, but Penelope Cruz dissappointed me. Specially with the still unfaded Irene Papas at her side (Zorba the Greek), I noticed how plain she acted. The producers should have searched for a second Irene Papas and casted her as Pelagia!!!! If we talk about a flaw in the movie, it was her plain acting and her failure to react chemically with the Mandras character.But on the whole, once the ""glorious"" Italian army, which surely earned our sympathy as poor blokes caught between a rock and a hard place, swaggered into Cephalonia, the movie gathers momentum, and doesn't lose it anymore.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

"Great, but don't expect the novel","In Britain, you can guarantee that there's always someone on the Tube reading the novel Captain Corelli's Mandolin. You can also guarantee that anyone who has read it will say, 'How can they make it into a film?' I also thought that, but was not disappointed. Set on the island of Cephalonia, CCM basically tells the love story between Pelagia (Penny Cruz) and Captain Antonio Corelli (Cage), set against the unfolding story of WW2. It changes elements of the book (as it had to), but for the good and is shot intelligently, sympathetically and beautifully, with some marvellous performances - John Hurt being a notable. OK, so it doesn't tell the book word for word and it distorts some of the original history, but it looks wonderful, is engaging and very emotional.

A war and love story about Italy and Greek islanders in WW II,"""Captain Corelli's Mandolin"" is based on a 1994 novel of the same name. I haven't read British author Louis de Berniéres' book; so my take on this story is solely based on the quality of the film. I first saw the movie in a theater when it came out. I enjoyed it enough, that years later I bought the DVD – primarily for my WW II movie collection. I have since watched this film a couple of times.Those who read and enjoy history know the general story of Italy's involvement in WW II. Under the tyrant Mussolini, the Italians went to war on the side of Nazi Germany. We also know that most Italians' hearts were not with their official cause. So, after Mussolini was overthrown on July 25, 1943, Italy surrendered to the Allies. Nicolas Cage, as Capt. Corelli, makes that point in the film when he says that Italy surrendered to Great Britain and the United States – not to Germany. The Italians in southern Italy later fought with the Allies; while in the North under German control, the Italians were involved in many underground operations. They hid Jews and helped downed Allied pilots escape, and carried out espionage against the Germans.This movie, like the book it's based on, is a story of Italians who were sent to occupy the large Greek island of Cephalonia. And, of their heroic conflict with the superior German forces after Italy surrendered to the Allies. It is also a story about the island, its people and tumultuous history. And, it is a love story about the Italian captain and the island doctor's daughter, Pelagia, played by Penélope Cruz.The acting, directing and all aspects of this film are excellent. The cinematography is outstanding. The film was made on the island of Cephalonia. When I first saw this film, and since then, I've recalled another recent unusual film set in Italy in the war. ""Life is Beautiful"" came out in 1997. It was filmed in Italian, German and English, and won 3 Oscars of 7 nominations. It was a warmly told story about a Jewish father who makes a game out of his family's incarceration by the Germans in order to save his young son's life and spare him the horror of what was happening.That film endeared movie-goers at the time – if not all of the industry critics. ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin"" didn't fare as well. It had a big budget -- $57 million, but the critics mostly didn't like it, and it wasn't a box office hit. It is an American-made movie with American actors. But it is set in the actual location of the story. While the story is different, I think it is of the same ilk as the earlier film. It shows hope and humanity amidst tyranny. I think this film does an excellent job with its story. It is a very good love story as well, and I highly recommend it.I especially like the lines by Dr. Iannis (John Hurt) when he explains true love to his daughter, Pelagia (Penélope Cruz). He says, ""When you fall in love, it is a temporary madness. It erupts like an earthquake, and then it subsides. And when it subsides, you have to make a decision. You have to work out whether your roots have become so entwined together that it is inconceivable that you should ever part because this is what love is. Love is not breathlessness. It is not excitement. It is not the desire to mate every second of the day. It is not lying awake at night imagining that he is kissing every part of your body. No! Don't blush! I'm telling you some truths. That is just being in love, which any of us can convince ourselves we are. Love itself is what is left over, when being is love has burned away. Doesn't sound very exciting, does it? But it is.""",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A big lesson and a wonderful image,"Captain Corelli's Mandolin' is a film that you couldn't possibly forget, first of all simply because of the location of filming, which, in these days of lightning-sped urbanization fills the heart with a longing for peaceful, leveled life in nature's beautifully powerful company. Apart from the beauty that you see, there is a beauty that you percept inside your heart. It is a film where each character has a handful of choices before him, choices that may change his or somebody else's lives forever. There are no black-and white characters. It has so much to say about love, and not the usual kind shown in films  love that surpasses just falling in love. Love that binds two people together in such a way that not only war, but also time's separation cannot shatter it. It is a film about life passing by and how our hearts change with time  accordingly to what people around us, as well as ourselves, choose to do. It also teaches us that everything, I mean absolutely every little thing that happens to us has a reason and comes from someone whom we may call Fate. It is in what we DO with the things that happen, how we react to them, that our liberty and free will are held.I just came back from the cinema, it was only my second time viewing CCM, but I ensure you it will not be the last. Penelope Cruz is charming, and has a difficult role, where her character must choose, and show dignity and honor in the choices she makes. I call it difficult because she does not simply play a woman in love with the enemy. She plays a woman who time led through falling in love, being in love, and took her where little actresses I know have ever been  to a time of real love, not exciting, not breathless, not rash and quick to fade, but patient, smart, and everlasting. It is the ability to ACT OUT the difference that, apart from her amazing beauty, I greatly admire. I am also wonderfully surprised by the accent that all the actors have developed accordingly to what nationality their characters were. They were all really genuine, well maybe except for Gunter, who could have been better. Nicolas Cage's character had so much color and life inside, that his rather unhandsome appearance did not seem unequal to his partner's evident beauty. Go see it, even if you do not like war films. It is definitely a film of unforgettable beauty and challenging wisdom.",,Anonymous,Music

"Gives new meaning to ""Mediocre""","Okay, stop me if you've heard this one before.  There was a Greek, an Italian, and a German on this island.... Oh, you've heard it before? Well, that's ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin"" in a nutshell.This movie had its ups and downs.  The photography was spectacular and the special effects very visual.  I was very disappointed with the script and the acting.  Were Nicholas Cage and Penelope Cruz awake while they were being filmed?  John Hurt did a credible job as the doctor / mayor of the Village, but he was no Anthony Quinn. This was neither a great romance nor a good World War II story.  When you compare it to a really great WWII movie about Greece, like ""Guns of Navarrone"" it doesn't hold up.  There were a few funny lines and amusing scenes, especially when the Italians sang opera while the German officer watched, without a clue.

"Great play, fascinating Greek culture and a classic story told in an interesting manner","It is a love story and there are so many of them in the movie industry but still, it seems different. Is it because of the actors, who play as there were actually there, at that time and make us believe that these events are really occurring? (it is surprising to see how much effort was made just to get the Greek accent when they are speaking in English!)Is it because we're not used to seeing stories taking place in amazing greek islands which have, in a weird way, something very familiar: in a way it's very far but you feel very close to those characters, this place, the events..If you like Greek culture, there is great chance you'll feel the same way. Besides,it is a love story which takes place during world war two. It sounds like you already know how the story is going to end right from the start but you don't. you only think you do! The director doesn't try to make a drama. Even in the saddest moment, hope reappears. He mostly prefers to leave some parts to our imagination, which could have been extended much more by other directors. There isn't any exaggeration from the director's part, even if it's a love story he never insists in extending the scenes where something actually happens between the lovers, he prefers to concentrate on preliminary acts(!). The war,shown the same way, is much more effective from our side, it is fast and hard. At the end there is this feeling of having listened to a enchanting song:it was melancholic and joyful, and it was worth it.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Sorry but what a disappointment!,"Not having read the book but being assured by many that it was great, I had high hopes for this film especially with the great cast list.

He should stick to the kooky types he's so good at.The Italian stereotype was played to extraordinary lengths, opera singing, cigarette hungry, ""bella bambina"" chasers, and to complete the stereotypes we even had the sympathetic Nazi! I don't know how the book dealt with these characters, but I bet it was a whole lot different!In its favour it did get more interesting by the time those ever reliable bad guys the Nazis moved in but by then I was past caring.A real shame.",,Anonymous,Music
Photography... Go see it.,"In my opinion, this film has wonderful lighting and even better photography. Too bad the story is not all that good and Mr. Cage sometimes loses his accent. But two thumbs up for lighting and the DP!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Great acting saves it from becoming an exercise in photography,"I enjoyed this film much more than I expected to, and that was largely due to the high standard of the acting.  It's true that some of the accents were poor - especially John Hurt, who veered between upper-class English and some kind of anonymous Mediterranean dialect.  That aside, all the main characters were convincing.  I particularly liked Christian Bale and Penelope Cruz.  David Morrissey as the young German officer also showed why he is hammering on the door of stardom. This film had nearly everything - humour, pathos, violence and sex, plus beautiful scenery.  However, it began to drag towards the end, and I found the denouement totally unconvincing.  But, as modern films go, it was pretty good.  I think it will go down as a minor classic.",,Anonymous,Music
Excellent move.,"This movie gives us some WWII history along with some touching romance, a little fantasy and meaningful emotion - and beautiful scenery.  Nicholas Cage never fails us, and here again does a great job.  And so do the other principle characters.  One key charater, the physician/father played by John Hurd, delivers (to his daughter) one of the best definitions of love I've ever heard.  Some of the events are a bit too coincidental to be real, but I excused that, knowing that this is partly fairy tale and fantacy.  My wife and I really liked the film.  And it is nice to watch people taking the risks to love the enemy.  One man who left the theatre near us said to his wife, ""Now that's the way to wage war!""  I think you'll see what he means when you watch the Italian occupiers of this lovely Greek island.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
a war storie,"The lead virtue - the actors. The week point - the story. It is a nice film about ordinary people in middle of war. About decisions, about fears, about love. The only real problem is exactly the birth of love. Unrealistic, only a poor sketch but, maybe, only a serie could save the situation. For me, the motif for see , time by time, this film is the work of Irene Papas and John Hurt. And , sure, the realism of atmosphere.",,Anonymous,Music
Ignore the cynics,"Forget all those people who tell you it's not as good as the book. So what? This is a film after all. It is a sheer joy to watch, made entirely on location in Cephallonia, gorgeous photography but with dark, disturbing moments as well. The only problem I have is with the obvious miscasting of Nicolas Cage as captain Corelli. Apart from that the film was a very pleasant surprise.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
It gets you involved on a whole lot of levels.,"The movie was taken from the book, ""Corelli's Mandolin.""  The author apparently listed every human emotion he could think of and tried to incorporate them all into one book.  I didn't read it but that's how the movie turned out.  It has humor, instrumental and vocal music, graphic violence, magnificent scenery, history, nature on the rampage, dancing, naked women, war-time atrocities, anticipated and unanticipated plot twists, and philosophy, all provided by an excellent cast.  I didn't anticipate, and was a bit put off by, the level of violence.  But, if you read the dedication at the end, you'll understand why it had to be.  Nicolas Cage has become my favorite contemporary actor.  He didn't disappoint.  Penelope Cruz is a gifted actress and, while IMHO she's not Sophia Loren/Rita Hayworth/Ingrid Bergman beautiful, it's hard to take your eyes off her. I've never seen John Hurt give anything less than a terrific performance. If he doesn't get an Oscar nomination for this one, I don't see any reason to continue awarding them.  In one scene, he explains to Cruz (his film daughter) what love is.  All I can say is, ""Wow!!!""  I've seen better movies this year.  But this one is plenty good enough to more than justify the price of admission.",,Anonymous,Music
Credit should be given to those that earned it!,"These critics need to find a new job!!! This movie is based on a TRUE STORY, which has made history.

The Blue eyed Cage & the delightful Cruz were amazing! Together they perfectly portrayed how a Mediterranean couple can only become closer in the time of war. This movie will touch your heart like it did mine you must go see it!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A flawed movie,"The problem with producing a movie based on a book is that sometimes movie-makers try to turn the book into a movie.The texture of the book is found in the detailed and poetic prose that describe the anecdotes of the quirky characters and explained parts of their lives and their motivations. For example, there is Father Antonio who gets alcohol poisoning because he is too greedy for the offerings his parishioners bring. There's Mandras, the idealistic and playful fisherman who finds his soulmates while swimming with dolphins. There's Carlo Guercio the gay Italian soldier who falls in love with another solider Francesco who inspires him to heroic acts that even his Greek enemies cheer. There's Dr Iannis who speaks with the longest words he can find for no other reason than he is Greek. The book is filled with these stories so much so that there's hardly any space left for the love story of Captain Correlli and Pelagia.The movie attempts to cram as many of the stories into the first 40 minutes. The book managed to pace itself with luscious descriptions of the island, but movies with their finite time spans and budgets do not have that luxury. The result is that pacing was completely lost and felt hurried and cramped. I also felt that the actors seemed to feel the pacing and hurried in their speeches as well, especially Nicolas Cage. Certainly each scene by itself was a credit to the director, cinematographer and the actors in them, but the editor left hardly a pause for the audience to take a breath and inhale the atmosphere. I would have loved to see what the movie would have been like if it were three hours long instead of its paltry one hour and 50 minutes.This is not to say that the moviemakers are completely to blame. The author himself bears a certain degree of responsibility. In his book, Louis de Benieres furnished each character with a chapter for themselves so that the wonderful tales of their lives and loves could be told. Yet conspicuously missing is the one for Captain Corelli. Captain Corelli in the book became more like a machine that was built for spouting one-liners and for buffoonery and only appeared toward the middle of it. I'm suggesting that the character of Captain Corelli was nowhere near developed enough to centre a movie around. I've always felt that the best love stories only fluorished in backdrops of drama and social and cultural tension. There was none of that during the occupation on the island of Cephalonnia thanks to the incessant camaraderie between the native Greeks and the Italian soldiers who occupied their island. Thus the love story had so little drama that it felt more like a teenage crush story with all its awkwardness and assumptions. I would stick my neck out to suggest that de Benieres wrote in the character of Captain Corelli and named the book after him as a cynical joke played on his publishers after they insisted that a book of the inhabitants of a tiny Greek island during its occupation in World War II would not sell as well as a romance novel.Having said all that, I would recommend that you watch the movie and read the book. In that order. You can introduce yourself to the characters during the movie. But allow the book to flesh them out for you. Trust me on this.",,Anonymous,Music
"A beautiful film, an even better book","This excellent adaptation of Louis de Berniere's book is not as good as the book. It is incomplete, and the script is cut with a chainsaw. I gave it a 9. So you need to multiply 9 by 5 or 6 (on a total of 10) to have an idea of what the book deserves. 45? Yeah that's about it.Really.The book is a masterpiece of literature and the film chops a major character down to a few lines, another character to a few moments, and major historical plots to insignificant references. Plus the book has the courage of a sad ending whereas the film goes to a happy ending, and still a happy end is what you'd wish because the characters ""deserve"" it. I gave the film a 9 because managing to make a coherent film when you have thrown away (for lack of time) two thirds of a script and still make such a wonderful film, with actors that fit so well in their role, a film where you will cry and where you will be afraid like you're 6 and everything that happens on the screen is for real, please please forgive them for salvaging the core of the script and making you want to read the book, which will keep you fascinated and remain in your memory for the rest of your days.The story - but do you really need this in a nutshell? - is about acts of heroism and love and the horrors of the war. Reducing it to a love story is just this, reducing it, and it certainly does not deserve it.

I liked this movie very much,"My interests and tastes in movies goes back a long ways, and I have seen most of the better American and English-language movies made all the way back to the earliest days of movie-making. I'm one of the few people I know who likes even silent movies!Captain Corelli's Mandolin has a lot going for it. Two attractive co-stars (Cage and Cruz), a good supporting cast and a good plot. The dialogue is well-written and contains romance, wisdom, history and humor. It is also well-photographed, well-staged and technically a very good production. (I assume the Ju-87 Stuka dive bombers shown were done by animation.)I saw this film on one of the cable film channels, and had to break off before the ending because I was going to be late for a wedding I was attending as a guest. I have fretted for more than a week because I didn't know how the movie ended and really wanted to know if Pelegia and Corelli wound up together. So I rented the DVD and played the whole film and was delighted to see that I'd missed some good parts when I first saw it, so the second viewing was well worth it. And the part the film was in when I left the first time was a good half hour before the movie ended--so I'm glad I didn't stay or I'd have never made it to the wedding.Nic Cage is a far better actor than I ever thought he was and I never get tired of looking at and listening to Penny Cruz. I will buy this movie as soon as I can find it.Warren",,Anonymous,Music
Real Life Love,"Captain Corelli's Mandolin is one of Nicolas Cage's better films. He turns a fine performance as the title character. This is a romance set against the backdrop of a worn torn island. John Hurt's character gives his daughter, played beautifully by Penelope Cruz, some honest advice about love. This movie doesn't have the fault of being completely predictable. This movie also allows Cruz to turn in a performance as a strong woman who knows her own mind and heart. Once the film warms up beyond the opening sequence this film keep you focused on it. Again, Nicolas Cage did not disappoint.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Like the book (which I started but didn't finish), the movie begins slowly, but once it gets going it draws you in and won't let you go. This is a different sort of love story. Cage & Cruz give wonderfully understated performances that manage to communicate both the palpable longing that draws Corelli and Pelagia together and the internal conflicts & social pressures that pull them apart.John Hurt's performance as Pelagia's father is fabulous. In fact, this film is just full of ""smaller"" stories you wish they'd had time to tell you.It's a masterpiece of subtlety and nuance. You'll want to watch this one again and again!",,Anonymous,Music

Captain Corelli's Mandolin is very meaningful. But that's it!,"I saw this movie yesterday and thought it was fairly good since it had a pretty fitting title, but I was somewhat disappointed with the acting and the ending. ""Capitan Corelli's Mandolin"" is a perfect title for this movie, since it tells about the way Capitan Corelli played his mandolin quite well. The mandolin signifies so many things in this movie. For instance, he could have felt happy by playing it for his love Pelagia (Penélope Cruz) or he just wanted to help relieve the tension.During a war it's obviously quite difficult to be happy or peaceful; this mandolin signifies many things in this movie: love, cleverness, happiness, etc. I think this is why I liked it. This mandolin is very important for Capitan Corelli, since it's his only refuge to show his love, hope, triumph and peace. This movie is very valuable to me and requires a thoughtful watcher. It's the only Nicolas Cage movie I have liked so far.The plot is well told. John Madden (Shakespeare's in love director) has made another worthy film in which he keeps the viewer interested in knowing what will happen to Capitan Corelli and Pelagia's love after the war; he shows us they could be very happy after the war.  Penélope Cruz was appropriate to star as Capitan Corelli's lover. She wasn't that great, but she shows us her good acting skills, even though she's from Spain. She also shows us that people from Spanish speaking countries can be good at acting. Christian Bale played Mandras rather well, it shows us he was also appropriate to play this character; he really did it much better than his earlier role in American Psycho. It's amazing to see him letting Capitan Corelli live after being so hurt by the Germans.`Capitan Corelli's Mandolin"" takes us to Greece in 1940, where the Second World War is going to start. Pelagia (Penélope Cruz) and Mandras (Christian Bale) are in love; they will get married after Mandras returns from fighting for his country. Pelagia meets the Italian Capitan Corelli who is living in her house. Capitan Corelli falls in love with Pelagia and vice versa; however, they know it'll be a frustrated love, since she's engaged with Mandras who is fighting for his country and will come back to marry her. The war takes place and many Italians get killed, and Capitan Corelli gets hurt badly. Overall this is not a bad production, but I'd hoped for much more. 7/10",,Anonymous,Music

A mostly enjoyable time at the movies.,"The star of this movie was, of course, the island and its beautiful scenery. This is a cinch for best cinematography. Such a beautiful place so beautifully captured on film. I liked most of the plot considering, of course, it was pure fiction which is ok. The love story was predictable but interesting. I did not like the portrayal of the German officer. He was a wimp and whether we like it or not I doubt that any wimp made it to the rank of a German captain during World War II> His portrayal at the surrender ceremony was ridiculour. If a mayor of a Greek town had acted in that manner in real life the German would have known how to handle him and he would not be alone; he would have had a squad of men with him. The mayor using the F word was also ridiculour. Do people in Hollywood think they always have to have this word in every movie they make. The mayor could have been defiant in another way and it is doubtful if the Greeks in 1945 even used the word although they may have had other expletives just as strong. I liked the music in the movie and would have like even more of the mandolin playing. The Italians during World War II were not known to be very adept at fighting so it was rather difficult to accept them as being more interested in making music and first and then turning in the last part of the picture to being expert combat soldiers. I thought it was very unrealistic to have the German soldiers making their assault on the island in modern landing craft similiar to LSTs of World War II> Hey, the U.S. Navy in World War II had the amphibious ships for D-Day and in the Pacific. The Germans did not have that kind of capacility. Yes, they could have landed troops from ships but not the kind shown in the picture. The ending was quite pat, but in the larger sense it was a good ending because like most good Hollywood endings it left you with an upbeat feeling. I gave it an 8 in the review. Maybe I should have given it a 9.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

When Character Was King,"Warning:  If the Coen Brothers or David Lynch define your taste in film, disregard this review and move on.Yes, I borrowed the ""one line summary"" from the book about President Ronald Reagan, but, among other virtues, this movie emphasizes the role that character plays in the lives of honorable human beings.  This film is full of honest, decent people, and they have integrity to spare.  In a word, they have ""character.""A small nitpick:  Unless you know the history of WW II, you probably don't know that, from Captain Correlli's arrival on the island to the fall of Mussolini, 3 and one-half years have passed.  The average viewer might think the romance was of the ""whirlwind"" variety.  That is not so.  The romance develops slowly, which gives it both dignity and meaning.  The film's deliberate pace may be the director's way of marking time.Some reviews have criticized Cage's Italian accent.  The Italian-speaking members of my family assure me that his accent is quite good.The history was right on the mark.  Yes, the Germans turned against their Italian allies, who, for the most part, were reluctant allies from the start.  If you find that shocking, keep in mind that the French Mediterranean fleet was blown up by the British in 1940, just after France's capitulation, lest it fall in the hands of the Vichy government, or worse, the Nazis.The depiction of the Italians as educated and cultured was a compliment to an educated and cultured civilization.This film was beautifully photographed, and its story was lyrical.  The script was not thought-provoking, nor was it clever, but here was a situation where confusion and cleverness were not needed, nor would they have been appropriate.The story is tender, and the message is uplifting.  The characters are honest, brave, earnest, sympathetic, and likeable.  It's a nice little film. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
I was pleasantly surprised!,"When I first heard of Captain Corelli's Mandolin, I thought, ""Great, another boring, awful love story. I hate Penelope Cruz. I hate Nicholas Cage. I hate sappy, sentimental love stories!"" When I heard that Christian Bale was in it, I was interested. I have been obsessed with Bale ever since I saw him in Newsies, and have been following his career closely. This was one of the few movies of his I hadn't seen, so I rented it. And I was pleasantly surprised! The movie is laden with tender, sweet scenes on the backdrop of beautiful Cephallonia (I think that's the island). The visuals and cinematography are spectacular. The story is rich with the beauty of the island, and the charm of the natives. I really enjoyed the scenes of dancing and Greek parties.  The leading stars are great, I have to admit. Nicolas Cage plays his part as Captain Corelli wonderfully. He has that innocence and starry-eyed romanticism that carries the role. And Penelope Cruz, who I thought had no acting ability, shines as Pelagia, the simple, beautiful girl, daughter of the town doctor. She is believable and gorgeous. :) And Christian Bale, my favorite actor of all time, has much more screentime than I initially thought- it was great! He is awesome, as per usual (and looking mighty fine, might I add <wink>). I found his scenes believeable as well. His talent goes beyond words. :) All in all, CCM is a sweet, simple movie with plenty of powerful scenes. If you don't like love stories, give it a try. If you don't like Penelope Cruz, give it a try. And if you're pretty sure that you're ready to travel to Greece, definitely check this out!",,Anonymous,Music

Good but not a masterpiece!,"Although i can't say i was thrilled, i quite enjoyed watching this film. Filmed entirely on location, using many locals as well as many professional greek actors, the director succeeded in conveying the atmosphere of the time(Cephallonia in the 40's) to the audience. The dramatic, unspoiled landscape of the island provided some of the most magical scenes of the film,despite the fact that it did not receive any help from the music score, which was surprisingly bland,unemotional and overally unsatisfactory,especially towards the most dramatic final scenes. Moving on to the plot, i was pleasantly surprised to discover that many of the historical inconsistencies and inaccuracies found in the book, were omitted.Predominantly, i am referring to the depiction of the greek partisans, who were presented as brutal animals by the author of the book,that only contributed to an eternal, internal strife, and failed to offer any actual help to the enslaved greeks. In reality however, the partisans liberated significant parts of Greece during the 4 year german occupation, as well as helping the allies in many instances.Internal strife and civil war did not broke off until after the liberation of Greece.In the film the partisans and especially Mandras were presented in a more realistic and complex manner.However i was very disappointed at the way the actual love-affair was presented. I have already seen the film twice and despite all my efforts i failed to realise exactly when did Pelagia and Corelli stopped disliking each other and fell in love.Furthermore, the first 45 or so minutes of the film,consist of various events crammed in badly sewn together scenes, which make it quite difficult for anyone to actually enjoy the film, since all are busy trying to figure out what is going on.Moving on to the acting, i will agree with practically everyone who has seen the film, that Cage was horribly miscast(to put it mildly)as Captain Corelli.He failed in every way to convey Corelli's sensitivity,love of life,but also confusion when faced with the brutality of the germans.All that he was able to convince us of, was that he can't sing(notice a shot of his back when he is suppossed to be singing at a high note). Cruz on the other hand was very good as Pelagia, but unfortunately, her great acting was overshadowed by Cage's feeble attempts to act. John Hart's performance was rather mediocre. He provided respectable consistent acting throughout the film, but lacked originality and depth of emotions. Irene Papas on the other hand was excellent, and her performance really added life and passion to all the scenes she appeared in(which were rather limited i am afraid).Finally, Christian Beale, was very good as well, as Mandras, and managed to convey the two conflicting sides of his character. Generally, this was a good enough film, which however could have been a masterpiece had the script been more consisted and had the acting been more substantial.",,Anonymous,Music

And why is a sensual tango (of the kind that Europeans were not aware in the '40s) with an enemy soldier not punishable, while a thank you peck on the cheek of the other enemy soldier is punished by death? No, this film doesn't pay any attention to detail and it doesn't even try to parody the situation with modern-day parallels, like Madden's other film, Shakespeare in Love. John Hurt is very good.

"Memorable Cruz, Forgettable Cage in Guilty Romantic Pleasure","Based on a popular novel by Louis de Bernieres, John Madden's 2001 adaptation of ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin"" is a pleasing, if flawed, film that may enrage fans of the book. Filmed on the Greek island of Cephalonia and set during World War II, the story revolves around the romance between Pelagia, daughter of a local doctor, and Captain Corelli, an Italian soldier stationed on the island with his company. Romantic entanglements ensue when Corelli is billeted in the doctor's home; Pelagia is already engaged to Mandras, a hunky local fisherman, and danger escalates when German troops arrive to assume command after Mussolini surrenders to the Allies.Enhanced by John Toll's gorgeous cinematography of the Adriatic island and Stephen Warbeck's beautiful score that includes the haunting ""Pelagia's Song"" or ""Ricordo Ancor,"" which is sung over the closing credits by Russell Watson, ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin"" could have been a classic romance of love amidst war. The casting began well with Penelope Cruz, who is perfection as Pelagia. However, after Cruz, the casting falters, before ultimately flopping. While John Hurt is a stretch as a Greek doctor, his skill as an actor makes him credible in the role. Christian Bale as the young Greek fisherman is a bigger stretch, but he too tries valiantly, although his accent comes up short. The biggest problem is Nicholas Cage as Corelli; while Cage is of Italian descent, he reeks American and is completely wrong for the part. Cage's performance seems as forced as Cruz's is effortless; her attraction to the big lumbering oaf with a bent for opera is unconvincing and leaves the film with a gaping whole at its center. The script by Shawn Slovo abbreviates the novel and also sidesteps a critical point; Slovo cuts the pivotal character of Carlo to little more than a cameo and thus obscures the motivation for a crucial moment in the story.While the film was a major disappointment when the novel was fresh in mind, time has been kind, and, with expectations lessened, the pleasures of ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin"" emerge. Penelope Cruz is Pelagia, and her lovely performance is the film's major asset. Add the location cinematography, a small role by the incomparable Irene Papas, and the unforgettable song ""Ricordo Ancor,"" and many fans of romantic movies may enjoy a film that throws light on a barbaric near-forgotten episode during World War II. Some viewers may also be inspired to seek out the novel, which expands and deepens the events depicted in the film. Otherwise, ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin"" can be classified as a guilty pleasure for a rainy afternoon.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Dumb and unconvincing.,"Among other things, the love story (i.e. the main story) in this really needed some more development. Um...when exactly did they fall in love?

Mandolin Off Tune,"Ever since the closing moments of `Notting Hill when the Hugh Grant character was seen reading the novel `Captain Corelli's Mandolin' with its distinctive blue cover, like so many fellow readers of this superb work I have looked forward eagerly to the film from the same British production company of Working Title. Essentially people's reaction to the movie is likely to depend on whether or not they are familiar with the book. My three companions at the cinema had not read the novel and loved the movie. I suspect that most of those who have savoured the written version will like me  leave with their undoubted pleasure tinged with a sense of disappointment.Of course, a film always has to be different from the book, not least because of the distinctive media being used and the variable time available  and `Mandolin' is a particularly long and complex work. Therefore I can understand scriptwriter Shawn Slovo abandoning almost all the political references and concentrating on the romance, although I think that the result is a little too sanitised. I can even appreciate the need to change the ending and make it more immediate and emotionally satisfying. But was it really necessary to excise even the homo-erotic relationship between Corelli and his saviour Carlo?The greatest strength of this work from British director John Madden (`Shakespeare In Love') is the island of Cephallonia itself and, whatever the extra cost, the decision to shoot it entirely on location has resulted in some wonderful photography and a sensuous feel to the whole work. The chief weakness is the casting. The gorgeous Spanish actress Penelope Cruz is perfect as the young object of Corelli's affections Pelagia and John Hurt is rather good as her father, the local physician Dr Iannis. But Nicolas Cage is seriously miscast as Antonio Corelli, with mannerisms and accent that defy credibility, while David Morrissey is even worse as the leading German on the island and Christian Bale little better as the rival for Pelagia's love, the fisherman turned resistance fighter Mandras.",,Anonymous,Music

Sap. Pure sap.,"At first I thought the movie would be OK- most of the acting was decent (save for Nicholas Cage's embarrassing Italian accent- I half expected him to tell Pelagia ""I want to suck your blood""), the island the characters lived on was beautiful, and the plot seemed like it could be good if it was done right. Unfortunately, it wasn't. The dialogue was embarrassing, all attempts to show the devastation of war were sugarcoated horribly and insultingly, and the characters all turned out to be irritating. The movie never really grabs you- it's a cliched love story, not much more.",,Anonymous,Music
a great love story with beautiful actors,"To say the truth, I went to see this movie only because Nicolas Cage is my favorite actor. Folks may not agree, but he makes equally good performances in bad and good movies. I haven't seen a movie with Penelope Crus before, so I was anxious to see whether she is a good actress. So, here's what I think:The movie is good (I haven't read the novel, however). Some moments were really thrilling and... unexpected. Altogether you'll find the plot pretty simple. So the only thing that could save the movie, which (an experienced viewer will know that from the beginning) would either end tragically or happily, was the performance of both Cage and Crus. And it was GREAT, GREAT, GREAT!!! In the latter part of the movie I even liked a rather broad accent of the actress (Spanish, but for those who don't speak Greek that's OK, and she even looks like a Greek girl). Overall the movie is highly enjoyable and has a good deal of irony (fans of classical music will surely have fun at some moments:)I give it 9/10. You should see it!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Trouble in paradise,"First of all, just to get it out of the way, I'd like to say that yes, I read Louis de Bernieres' magisterial, charming, evocative, panoramic novel shortly before going to see its celluloid adaptation; and whilst the film compares highly unfavourably to the book, that is not really the point. What is the point is that, whichever way you slice it, this film is extremely poor.Much has already been said about the extreme ropiness of the accents all round.  We have Nicolas Cage sounding like he's wandered in from a Cornetto advert, a Spanish Greek, a scouse German (to quote Empire magazine), and a passable Greek accent from John Hurt.  But what is most amusing is that there are supposed to be four different languages knocking about the film (Greek, Italian, German, English), but, due to Hollywood's fear of subtitles, there is in fact only one.  Consequently, in one scene, a Greek listens to a BBC news report (in English, and supposed to be), then says (in English, but ostensibly Greek) that he does not understand it.This aside though, the central romance, between Captain Corelli and Pelagia, is really where the film either stands or falls; and sadly, it does the latter.  The two characters share what seems like virtually no screen time, and certainly no chemistry.  I must mention the book here, because in it, there is a true sense of the relationship between the captain and Pelagia. But in the film, any sense of longing or depth is lost, only to be replaced by the tangibly physical, which fails to convey any sense of true intimacy.Indeed, the characters never seem to come together.  They just seem to all be wandering around in their own little movies, never interacting beyond a few words.  This seriously undermines any sense of pathos when tragedies strike, and makes the film very sterile.  Moreover, the characters, even when taken alone, are utterly two-dimensional.  Perhaps four or five of the characters are given any decisive shape at all.  The rest are so insubstantial that, whatever happens to them, you simply don't care.So, there we have it.  A romance without romance; a comedy without humour; a war movie without a sense of destruction or loss.  ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin"" fails in all categories.  And it doesn't even look that good. Cephallonia is a place of outstanding natural beauty, but even the cinematography - something I'd of thought they'd be bound to get right, if nothing else - seems strangely muted and washed-out.I admit I take films seriously, but I also try to enjoy them, if I possibly can.  And in this case, I'm sorry, John Madden (who directed the wonderful ""Shakespeare In Love""), Nicolas Cage (a truly great character actor) and John Hurt (legend), but I couldn't.",,Anonymous,Music
"Greek Island, Italians, Germans, WAR... Bad Acting!","I remember the fuss & bother about the original book's publication & since then I've come across a seemingly endless number of people who've bought it, but never finished it. If the film is anything to go by, I can understand why.First of all the film has the natural advantage of being set in the Mediteranean, so you get the beautiful backgrounds of the sea, blue skies, lush olive groves & so on. Although I have no idea if it was filmed in the Greek islands that's what fills the screen & it's pleasing on the eye. The CGI German Stukas still look unreal, proving that the computer programmers have a long way to go even before they can replace objects, let alone people, but CGI is only to be expected when showing such rare aircraft in the massed formations used in World War 2. Gone are the days when films such as The Battle of Britain, or The Battle of Midway could be filmed with the real thing! Those ex-mlitary aircraft, once so plentiful to film studios when the airforces of the world fianlly got rid of their old piston engined fighters in the 1960s, have long since passed into museums & private collections.As for the story, well I kept waiting for something to happen & all I got were a few fizzles & ultimately dissapointment. What does happen is so predicatable it's not worth the wait. The too-ing & fro-ing between the characters played by John Hurt, Nicholas Cage, Penelope Cruz & Chris Bale is yawnfully cliched & tired old stuff. Oh yes, it's a love triangle... how novel....'scuse me while I catch up on my sleep. There was one minor highlight very early on, where the town fathers wouldn't surrender to the Italians & insisted on a German officer instead, but that was about it.It doesn't even try to maintain accuracy, like when the sea-mine is exploded. Yes it's nice to finally see something of what an explosion REALLY does & not what Hollywood likes to make you see, but the simple fact is that sea mines contained a ton or half a ton of explosives & despite the sand-bagged bunker Corelli used he'd be minced meat, quite literally so.Also, can anyone tell me if the Germans ever used landing craft with drop fronts? As far as I was aware they never had anything like this in WW2. Maybe I'm wrong, but I suspect that modern day landing craft were used as the sight of barges lazily ploughing their way across the Aegean wasn't so dramatic.As for the actors, well Nicholas Cage should give up hopes of ever putting on an accent ever again. It was AWFUL! Overall he wasn't convincing either, something I can't put my finger on, but he was woefully miscast in the part of Corelli.As for Penelope Cruz.....well she's as sour faced as ever & simply uninteresting. Although the latter may have been a product of the overall disinterest I had in the film I have since seen her in the far more interesting ""Blow"" & the same impression lingered. She has a nice figure, no doubt about it, & the guys will cheer when she gets her top off for a roll in the hay with Corelli. But she's got that Audrey Hepburn thin neck/big head combination that looks like she will break at any moment. It also makes her look anorexic at times too.John Hurt ( the Brit') discharges his role with understated ease....aided by the fact that his character seemingly doesn't have much to do, despite being center stage for a lot of the time.Chris Bale wanders around as the third corner of the Cruz/Cage menage au trois, alternating between heroic, sympathetic, pathetic, to rebelious. All in all I'm left with the conclusion that the story simply doesn't give the actors enough to do. Nick Cage's Corelli does seemingly have an indestructable nature, he survives being bombed, shot & blown up (the sea mine incident), to return to his beloved greek girl (Cruz). The earthquake of 1947 is shown, why I don't know, maybe it was a real incident that had to be worked into the story, but it just seems to happen & what it's supposed to mean I'm not at all sure.It's hard to be so down on a movie, but that's the way it goes with something like this. I'm glad to say that the night wasn't wasted, I'd rented ""The Rutles"", so had plenty to laugh at this week (a BBC comedy, half Monty Python, Half Saturday Night Live based on the life of the Beatles & the inspiration for ""This Is Spinal Tap""...try it, you won't be disapointed).For those who rent this on DVD, forget any bonus material, no cut scenes, out takes, behind the scenes, or ""making of"" stuff, completeing on DVD the overall disapointment of the film.",,Anonymous,Music
A better tune than I had expected,"This is a real ""old-fashioned"" love story.  However, it has an unusual and interesting background, being set on one of the Greek islands during first the Italian, and the German occupation during World War II.There has been some criticism of the fact that some of the events relating to Italy's departure from the Axis are not presented accurately.  But the basic fact remains the same; the Germans occupied the areas held by the Italians at the time of their departure.  This is, after all, entertainment, and not a treatise on Italy's role in World War II.As well, the variety of accents in the film, from Penelope Cruz's Spanish accent to the vaguely Italian one of Nicholas Cage, has been criticized. However, unless one is prepared, where one is making films with a non English-speaking setting, to use just native speakers as actors (in this case, Greek, Italian and German) with subtitles for all, there is no good solution for the problem.  The results here are as good as can be expected, and a lot better than I have seen elsewhere.The whole thing makes me wonder to what extent I should trust reviewers.  A few weeks ago, having read glowing reports, I went to see ""Sexy Beast"", and loathed it.  As far as I was concerned, it was just the largely incomprehensible rantings of a sociopath, and more incomprehensible talk from his unpleasant associates.  I went to see this film having read that I should be prepared to dislike it, instead, I enjoyed it thoroughly.",,Anonymous,Music
An Exhilarating and Wonderful Movie.,Captain Corelli's Mandolin was a great drama movie mixed with plenty of romance and war. This movie was very good and wonderful. Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz were brilliant and made the movie even better. John Madden directed the movie wonderfully. This movie is kind of sad and is excellent and takes a look on World War 2 in a different way than other movies have. This is a wonderful movie. I give Captain Corelli's Mandolin a 10 out of 10!!! :),,Anonymous,Music
unintentionally hilarious,It was inevitable that someone would try to film this hugely popular novel.Unfortunately this film is about as appealing as most Hollywood literary adaptations.Nicholas Cage is a little old to play the romantic lead and his Italian accent defeats any attempt at a credible performance.It's like something from a bad sitcom.Penelope Cruz is stunning as the female star but if she wants to remain the toast of Hollywood she'll have to do better than this.Worst of all Christian bale pops up as a rather effeminate resistance fighter who looks like he's been forced out of hiding because he ran out of moisturiser.Older stars like John Hurt are the best thing in the movie and Irene Papas can convey more with a single look than the three leads together...unfortunately neither are glamorous to be the focus of the movie.That about sums it up...a potentially beautiful story abandoned in favour of glossy visuals and slick production values.A missed oppurtunity!,,Anonymous,Music
Not the book but good,"To make a film out of De Bernieres book was always going to be an impossible task. However, the film that did end up being given the title ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin"" is very good. It is not the book, it does not have many of the characters and most of the sub plots. Nevertheless, it does capture the feelings of the island and the main characters. The film is visually stunning and the acting is not too bad either. Nicolas Cage, who plays Corelli, does have an accent problem but you soon forget it and just enjoy the film. Penelope Cruz (Pelagia) is good and plays her part well. However, John Hurt emerges as the true star in this film. His Greek accent is amazing and his acting superb. Overall, this film is very good and deserves to be watched.",,Anonymous,Music
"Historical ""goof""","I just saw the film and thought it splendidly photographed, wonderfully acted and telling a poignant story.I detected a historical error, however, which may or may not have appeared in the novel (which I haven't read).The turning of the Italian soldiers upon the Germans is described as occurring upon Mussolini's surrender after the fall of Rome (which would have been in June of 1944).  Mussolini never surrendered to the Allies.  He had resigned in 1943 to be succeeded by Pietro Badoglio who surrendered to the Allies in September of 1943, whereupon the Germans moved into all parts of Italian occupied Europe not yet occupied by the Allies.  As I mentioned, Rome did not fall until June 5, 1944, one day before D-Day.The battle between the Germans and the Italians could therefore not have taken place upon the fall of Rome, nor was the Italian surrender to the Allies by Mussolini.",,Anonymous,Music
A good nap movie,"I will have to admit that I am already not a big fan of Nicolas Cage. After seeing this movie, it just confirms my attitude towards him and his acting. I went to see this movie with my sister last week.  After the first hour, we were both looking at our watch thinking that 3 hours had already gone by. The pace of the movie is extremely slow and the relationship between the Cage and Cruz characters was mundane, to say the least.  Perhaps the most annoying thing about this movie was the stupid accent that the actors/actresses were imitating.  However, there were something good about this movie.  I really enjoyed the scenery and music in this movie.  Also, John Hurt's performance was quite good.  Overall I would give this movie a 5.",,Anonymous,Music

It had been recommended on an internet travel forum as wonderful transatlantic airplane reading.  I have trouble catching z's on those long flights so will give credit where credit is due.It was evident that Nicholas Cage was chosen for the role of the Italian Captain because he has dark hair.

Could have been 4 stars!,"i Nicholas Cage è un uomo bello! Shame on Captain Corelli's Mandolin for taking away a four star rating from itself! What am I talking about? Well, CCM is one of the most romantic wartime films since English Patient, but, unlike the English Patient with its dramatic heart wrenching- mind-altering ending, Corelli goes past possible perfection and heads into ""enough already"" territory. A film afraid to let down any part of an audience (here the Hollywood ending portion of you), often alienates the audience that would have embraced it; this is Captain Corelli's Mandolin.It's a terrible shame, because Nicholas Cage was excellent- once you got over his accent and desperately stopped imagining his other less, shall we say, moviestar roles that sit in your memory caves making you smirk with each uttered ""bello bambino"" he presents from his adorable lips. Face it no one takes him serious and Captain Corelli could have changed that...The sexy sleepy eyed mankabab can act. Imagine that! But his filmmakers ruined his glory by foregoing a dialect coach, and leaving a rancid taste of week old mozzarella by way of the unnecessary, ongoing ending which muddied up the awe and left the audience bitter, once again. Think Artificial Intelligence, positively brilliant till Spielberg had to ad that last 30 minutes...Capt. Corelli takes place on picture postcard beautiful (thanks to cinematographer John Toll) Cephalonia (Kefallonia), Greece right as the Greeks have had a small victory in WW2 over in Albania. Hitler doesn't take to well to this small defeat and orders the allied Italians to ""move in"" on the Greeks. It's war stuff I won't bore you.On this small, but strategically placed island we meet a beautiful (I, personally, think she looks like a chicken) girl Pelagia (Penelope "" I don't even have to change my last name if we marry momma"" Cruz) and her father, the island doctor (a brilliant John Hurt). Pelagia has agreed to marry her studly Greek boyfriend, MANdras (studly Christian Bale) when he returns from the war.They are young and in love, or is it just lust? He's off and she is left alone to worry and wonder as to his faith because Mr. Sensitive, Mandras, never so much as etches his ""X"" into a letter and she fears he is gone forever.Meanwhile her father, in dire need of medical supplies, agrees to house a captain from the Italian army that's been sent by the allies to secure Cephalonia. More war stuffThe captain, named Antonio Corelli (Nick - remember to call Emily Blunt-Cage) is a life-loving, free spirit caught up in a war with his childhood friends not hell-bent on killing anyone, as, I imagine many young men are in a war. Capt Corelli will only shoot you if your opera preference is Verdi, then he has no mercy, and will not be held responsible for his troop's reaction. It's a little joke, as his men are all singers or musicians and part of an opera club back home. He and his bellowing Italians almost make war look fun.Pelagia and Capt. Corelli get off to a bad start. She thinks he's an ass for being so happy while war is all around them. He thinks she's adorable when she yells. So you know love is sneaking in through the goat's cheese poop of circumstances surrounding them. Naturally Mandras, her betrothed love, returns just as her heart and head is filled will wild Rhesus monkey sex thoughts of the charming Capt. and herself alone on one the many romantic island beaches partaking in some mixing of two ancient cultures under the Grecian moon.But, before the two men can battle each other the war takes a turn and Hitler is no longer cozy with the Italians. He's sending other Italian squads north to concentration camps and Capt. Corelli must make a decision involving trust and his future.As they say in Italian as the last drop of Chianti Classico Castello di Volpaia is sipped from the roman goblet, ""il partito è sopra""Sure, I'm biased about Cage- I adore this fellow. Admittedly, I'd like to wrap his tilapia in tzatziki and slowly undress him like the fine-layered moussaka he is. I also think he's become easy pickin's for the meaner-spirited press. Yes, he's the chairman of the board at the Nicholas Cage School of Acting where the motto is: ""one expression equals all expressions,"" but he really did a good job in Corelli and it will go unnoticed and ridiculed. He's no Benicio del Toro or Gary Oldman in the impeccable dialect/accent department. It seemed Nicky's education on Italian accent pronunciation probably involved simply popping in couple of Coppola's scenes involving a Godfather movie or two, while he slurped down an espresso. Next time he'll invest a little time. But still, he was, as always, enjoyable to watch and a helluva lot better than expected!Christian Bale looked his usual dangerous sexy self. I think I need a fix of American Psycho. He's a talented fellow who commands his screen.John Hurt, what can I say that hasn't been said in his long career? He's an ever-morphing actor who, no doubt, hires a dialect coach when on call for a ""foreign"" role. Ahem.Penelope Cruz didn't suck. I admit I don't understand the Hollywood hubbub around her. I think she resembles Ringo Starr in drag quite frankly but, I'm not a clam diggin' gal or a red-blooded man so, I'll leave it at that. She tries to be all pouty a little too much here or her performance would have been much better. I have liked a couple of her works so I'll spare her the verbal ballet.Snack Recommendation: Ouzo and Chianti, served with Porcini Pasta, Pancini Risotto, Patissada di Polenta, dolmades, for dessert, La Nociata and Baklava (walnut kind!)Starring: Nicolas Cage, Penélope Cruz, John Hurt Christian Bale, David Morrissey, and Irene PapasDirected by: John Madden",,Anonymous,Music
Captain Correli tugs at the heartstrings,"Based on Louis De Bernieres's bestseller this is a powerful love story set against the backdrop of real events during World War II.It all begins, idyllically enough, on the sunny Greek island of Cephallonia, where Dr Iannis's daughter, Pelagia, is engaged to local fisherman, Mandras. Iannis disapproves of the match, feeling that his only child could do better but the couple are happy enough until the war against Italy, in Albania, sees Mandras leave to join the Greek Army.  Pelagia writes to her fiancé, every day but hears nothing from him in return.  She assumes that he's dead - particularly when news arrives of the Greeks' defeat at the hands of the Italians' German allies.The lives of all the islanders are turned upside down, as Italian soldiers arrive to occupy Cephallonia.  When officers are billeted in local homes, Iannis and Pelagia are joined by the charismatic Captain Corelli.  Whilst the doctor treats this pragmatically, as an opportunity to get medical supplies from the Italians' quartermaster, his daughter finds her loyalties sorely tested.  Should she stay faithful to her newly returned war hero fiancé, or succumb to the charms of the mandolin-playing captain?  Before these matters of the heart can be resolved, Italy surrenders and the Germans launch a full-scale invasion.At first, Captain Corelli's Mandolin is a heart-warming tale of Italians and Greeks learning to live together in, if not harmony, then at least a kind of relatively peaceful co-existence.  The performances from the entire cast are superb, with John Hurt, in particular making the most of his part as the wise and witty Iannis and Penelope Cruz making a perfect Pelagia. Meanwhile, Nicolas Cage's brash, but also gentle and cultured, Captain Corelli is a bold piece of casting by director John (Shakespeare In Love) Madden.An A-list Hollywood actor sticks out like a sore thumb in a character driven film such as this but that's exactly as it should be.  Given the effect the character has on the people around him, he ought to look and feel slightly out of place.  After a few years of him seeming only to have appeared in thrillers and action movies, it's good to see Cage getting to grips with something that stretches him a bit more as an actor.Also excellent is Christian Bale.  His performance as the simple-hearted Mandras is light years from the slick yuppie of last year's American Psycho but he's totally convincing, even when he looks a little too much like Demis Roussos for comfort.Having set up characters you really care about and shown you enough of Cephallonia to have you mentally packing your suitcases for next year's holiday, the Nazi invasion sees the film perform an about face.  The action in the third act puts war films such as Saving Private Ryan to shame by being so much more emotionally affecting, because you're seeing people and places you feel that you know personally being blown up and shot to pieces.As one of the (apparently) few people who haven't read the book, I can't comment on whether Captain Correli's Mandolin is true to the novel but it is a terrific film and I wholeheartedly recommend that you see it.",,Anonymous,Music
As someone who hasn't read the book,"As someone who hasn't read the book, I was very impressed with this film. I got the chance to take part in a question and answer session with the director (John Madden), and he explained that there were reasons why he couldn't stick rigidly to the book. By all means i believe that the film has romanticised the book, but I thinkit works well. I thought Nicolas Cage was very good as was Penelope Cruz as the loyal Pelagia.Madden seems to have captured the light and feel of the Greek island perfectly. I also liked the use of the local cephallonians (bet ive spelt that wrong!!) they bought the local character into the film perfectly.

"Beautiful to see, but lacking direction","Captain Corelli's Mandolin (the movie) is a beautiful movie and the acting, especially by John Hurt, is quality. However, it is presented purely as a romantic story, while the books speaks so much more about the brutality of war.Take, for example, Mandras. In the book he starts off nice but mildly sexist and then is transformed by the brutality of his war experience in Albania and the Partisans to a cold-blooded murderer. Now in the film he turns into just the loser of a love triangle. But not completely... he still hangs the woman who likes the German. Why? It goes against his film character (although fits with the book character).And the film ending. Well, its how a love story should end. But CCM is really about how war tears people's lives apart and how we can make the best of it. The book's ending wasn't perfect either, but it was better.",,Anonymous,Music
"Romantic, Yes, But Romantic With What Woman?","You get World War II Greek island history that's been overlooked, as background.  You get strong performances.  You get generally incisive dialogue.

You are supposed to believe that someone who has no opinions almost all the time is nonetheless bound for a career as a doctor.  You are expected to find a woman who lacks ability to articulate her feelings should win the affection of the audience.  There must be millions of Pelagia-stereotypes who are born, live, and die.

Which is why I hated anything that was changed for the movie.  Especially how Mandras, Pelagaia's fiance, ""saved"" Corelli for the woman he loved.  The most disappointing part of the film, however, was the ending.  I LOVED the ending to the book; it made me cry tears of happiness (okay so I was a little emotional that day) so when the film ended where it did, I felt completely frustrated.  I wanted to scream at the screen.  Or maybe strangle someone.To anyone that hasn't seen the movie or read the book - my suggestion is you see the movie first.  That way, you won't be as disappointed as I was.",,Anonymous,Music
How did this happen?,"Surely, for a film that is based on a novel to be any good, it actually has to resemble said novel in some way?  This film, however, does not. Carlo's character, one of the major players in the novel, is completely and utterly shut out (under-written would be a huge understatement), while the character of Mandras is so ridiculous it made me wince.  In the novel he turns into a character full of resentment and bitterness, hates Corelli, tries to rape Pelagia, is disowned by his own mother and then commits suicide.  In the film, however, he is portrayed as noble - a good man who bows out of his relationship with Pelagia in order to ""make her happy"".  He even joins forces with Corelli at one point!  The films also ends too early - the novel goes on for over 20 years after the war and accounts for Corelli and Pelagia's future, and serves to reinforce the sense of loss - one of the story's main themes.  The film ends in 1947, though, with the earthquake which, in the novel, kills Iannis.  In the film, Pelagia simply finds him sitting by the rubble of their home, slightly flustered.Other characters such as Velisarios and Father Arsenios, as well as less important characters like Bunny Warren, are either missing or tremendously overlooked.  The sheer disregard of the novel shown by Shawn Slovo's abysmal script are an insult to de Bernieres' views and opinions that he tried to convey by telling the story in the first place.  As a result, the film fails to express the meanings it should contain.Fans of the film are likely to argue that although it fails to adhere to the original novel, it is still a good film.  But to argue this is to neglect the fact that it is not a film in its own right.  It is ""based on the novel"" and as such should stick to it for at least a minute.  This film does not. If the makers of the film were trying to steer away from de Bernieres' novel, they should have made their own, different movie.As a stand-alone film, Captain Corelli holds its own, but only due to the above average technical side of it - the cinematography, as many have said, is particularly note-worthy.  But the script, together with the fact that the film was ever made, completely destroys the entire ethos of the story. Read the book first, and then, if you think you can handle it, attempt to watch this awful monstrosity of a film.",,Anonymous,Music
Lavish setting can't make up for boredom,"It seems that whenever Hollywood runs out of ideas it turns to the latest best-selling book. Then having cast the wrong people, taken out the best scenes, ignored the readers' favourite characters and completely changed the ending, they unleash the final product on a public who loved the book but are destined to hate the movie.Following Bridget Jones' Diary and The Hole, the third such adaptation this month alone sees Nicholas Cage star as Captain Corelli in the movie based on Louis de Bernieres' novel.Corelli is officer of the Italian army occupying the Greek island of Cephalonia during World War Two. Despite the initial suspicions of the locals, the charm of the Italian soldiers soon wins them over. Central to the story is the love affair between Corelli and local girl Pelagia (Cruz).Considering that this is the focal point of the film, the chemistry between the two leads is minimal to non-existent. Cage and Cruz simply do not sit well together and at times openly appear uncomfortable on screen together.It doesn't help that the characters falling in love seems entirely improbable from what we are shown. They say very little to each other for the first hour and a half, and what they do say is generally hostile. Then, before you know it, they're busy declaring their undying love. It just doesn't wash.You can perhaps ignore that, plus the fact that the story veers from the book. You can possibly even see past the number of real-life deaths in the war that are completely skimmed over. The main thing you can't overlook however is just how boring the film is for most of its duration. The action doesn't pick up until the Germans arrive, and aside from an astonishing and evocative scene with the firing squad, the rest of the action is instantly forgettable.It seems that director John Madden (Shakespeare In Love) has made the same mistake as the BBC did with soap flop Eldorado: a decent plot has been sacrificed for a lavish location.It's difficult to work out just what audience the film is aiming to draw. A majority of the book lovers will detest it's meddling and general cinemagoers will be put off by the sluggish pace. Overall it's well filmed but with a lack of interesting plot, poor performances from its leads and a lethargic style there's not too much going for it.

Nick Cage is an Amercian of Italian ancestry, and his trained accent may be forced, but how can anyone NOT like Nick Cage.  He has screen charisma.  He's not really beautiful but he lights up the screen in all of his work. Penelope Cruz is another matter.  Who cast her as the salutable Bella Bambina??  She's cute.  Yes, I'll give you that, she's cute and has nice curves for a 98 pound wonder.  She's a competent actress. But she cannotbe mistaken for a young Sofia Loren, not even a young Laura Antonelli.  This part screamed out for the type of heart stopping screen beauty that really stands out.  It doesn't matter if she's a bedroom wizard (which she very likely is) because that only helps Tom Cruise, John Madden and the other lucky stars and producers. It doesn't come across on screen and it even costs money to the filmakers.  That's what makes me think she's THAT good.  Even in Captain Correlli, the gal playing the executed girlfriend (Vicky Moragaki??) of the German captain outshone Ms. Cruz on screen. That was a salutable bella bambina, not Penelope.But Mr. Madden should be commended for making this flick which will surely lose money in America but may do well in Europe (I hear they like Amercian movies which is why the French keep trying to outlaw them), and I hope his close times with Cruz were worth the losses entailed in the miscasting. See you at the chalkboard Monday, John!",,Anonymous,Music
"Beautiful travelogue, not much else","Well, after finally seeing Captain Corelli's Mandolin here in NorthAmerica (I noticed it was playing in France in June), I must say Iwas very disappointed.  I was hoping for an English Patient kind ofromance and got instead Moonstruck Moves to Greece.  NicholasCage is horribly miscast as the free-spirited captain, PenelopeCruz is obviously gorgeous to look at, but doesn't quite hit theemotional high notes that say, Kristin Scott Thomas did as thewoman torn between two lovers.  At the end, I felt I had seen aNational Geographic documentary on the Greek Islands (beautifully shot by John Toll who also did Legends of the Fall andBraveheart), but not too much else.   Some nice touches of thewar-is-hell message, but at the end, not very satisfying.",,Anonymous,Music
Speechless,"This movie was so great! Nicholas Cage and Penelope Cruz light up the screen. Nicholas Cage was brilliant and had a great Italian accent. It has everything. It has drama, it has war, it has love, and it has conflict. I recommend this movie.",,Anonymous,Music
Another romance during World War II,"Although it's not a wonderful movie, it surprises us a little due to it's setting. The story happens during World War II but in Greece, different from many others films of this genre. The main fact of it is love triangle, not bombs and shots (although you'll see them in the last minutes).In a small Greek island, Pelagia (Penélope Cruz) loves Mandras(Christian Bale) and they are engaged and hope to have a happy life ahead. However their plans are postponed when he goes to war against Italy in Albania. Their victory is suffocated by the Germans who attack and take the island and give its control to the Italians. While Mandras is far in the battlefields, Pelagia falls in love with Italian Captain Corelli, putting her engagement in risk. The rest is STORY...My Rate 7/10",,Anonymous,Music
"Yet another WWII love triangle that suffers from bad acting, but looks great!","Hollywood strikes again! This is the third World War II love triangle this summer based around a woman who must choose between two soldiers that have fallen for her. Like ""Pearl Harbor"", the woman believes her lover is dead and falls for another man, and like ""Enemy at the Gates"", bad accents and poor character development plague the film. Fortunately, this one was based on a popular novel by Louis de Bernieres, written much earlier than the others and was perhaps the only script that truly deserved the green light. The story takes place on the Greek island of Cephalonia, where Italian and German occupation has taken over the otherwise peaceful town. A beautiful young girl named Pelagia (Penelope Cruz) falls for an Italian captain (Nicolas Cage) while she believes that her fiancée, Mandaras (Christian Bale), died in battle. Mandaras returns only to find that Pelagia has given up on him and had already fallen for the mandolin-wielding captain.Cage and Cruz, while having proven themselves in other films, do not pass for Italian or Greek respectively. The true stars are supporting actors John Hurt, who plays Pelagia's father, Dr. Iannis and Christian Bale (Mandaras). Both have passable Greek accents and seem to fit the parts.Directed by John Madden (Shakespeare in Love), the film looks great. The scenery is beautiful and the battle sequences are shockingly believable and have an impact. The wide range of emotions in the two-hour span of the film works well, but main problem is that the two main actors just aren't magnetic enough to be believable. While the film had a lot of potential with a winning story, the miscasting is just too hard to look past. It is worth catching in the theatre for a matinee, otherwise just wait for the video.",,Anonymous,Music
Another love-war drama,"I agreed with another commentator's review that John Hurt should've received at least a nomination for Best Supporting Oscar. I was first bewildered that he was cast as a Greek doctor coz I had always thought John Hurt was one of the most 'British' actors I'd seen on screen but he pulled it off very well, from his tanned complexion (much thanks to the location I guess) down to his impeccable accent. Nicholas Cage tried to do his best and you could see his diversity and I appreciated the efforts he took, especially since he has Italian roots (Coppola). Christian Bale also shone as Greek patriot desperate to fight for his country and he was so passionate that I could almost fall in love with him. The worst miscasting however, was that of Penelope Cruz. Yes, the role was supposed to be of a simple Greek island girl and perhaps they couldn't find any other actress who was beautiful but not too extravagantly gorgeous that it'd make her believable in the role. But Penelope Cruz couldn't grasp the Greek accent and she had no chemistry with either Nicholas Cage nor Christian Bale.They did stretch the movie out to show the intensity between Captain Corelli and Pelagia before they actually made a love. I tend to squirm at supposed love dramas which have nothing but sex. The movie showed that Pelagia was desperately in love with Mandras but his patriotism was too much for her handle and instead she fell in love with Captain Corelli's carefree ways. It took a while but I shan't question the director for the length though it could probably test your patience a bit.If anything else, the location and gorgeous scenery make up for any defects the movie has. I can't stand war movies but I make exceptions for movies like this coz the scenery makes up for the violence and intensity of the plot. If anything, they score points on cinematography.",,Anonymous,Music
"if your not swept away by penelope cruz, the landscape will do just fine.","As I was watching the List of movies offered on Pay Per View, I stumbled across Captain Corellis Mandolin. It was a friday evening and the setting in my apartment was romantic, so i decided to give it a try. Surprisingly i thought CCM was intriguing, from the whole scenery to the acting to the love story. As we follow the story of a small greek island town who is being invaded by Italian Soldiers during World War two, it focus's on Penelope Cruz and Nicholas Cage (an Italian Soldier) as they meet and fall in love through out all the turmoil and tragedy that is brought upon by the war. CCM is very touching but also moves slow at parts. Although i couldnt imagine paying the full amount to buy the dvd, i would definatley recommend it as a cheap watch on pay per view.",,Anonymous,Music
Thoughtful and Enjoyable View of Wartime Life,"I found the movie to be very well put together -- excellent use of on location settings, believable battle scenes, well-developed characters, and a thorough look at the joyful, sorrowful, evil and tragic aspects of wartime life in an occupied country.  It also introduced me to details of a part of history that I hadn't really known before.I really enjoyed the quirky plot aspects of the entire Italian unit coming from one area, and all being members of the musical organization.  I had no problems with the accents or other aspects of actors of various nationalities playing characters of various nationalities -- is there some expert at ""accents"" anyway?I thought the emotions and complexities of emotions were well portrayed all around.  John Hurt was excellent, but so were all of the actors playing the ""lesser"" parts.  Except for the earthquakes, the movie made me want to go there on my next vacation... About the only aspect of the story that, when you stop to think about it, was unlikely, is that Correlli survived.  But then who wants a ""down"" romantic drama?The movie celebrates trying to make the most of a bad situation, and it certainly didn't pull any punches as to thinking that ""thinking happy thoughts"" and singing together can solve all the world's problems.  The recent hostilities between the Greeks and the Turks at a soccer match show that some things never change.",,Anonymous,Music
